            "abstract": "We present the results of field measurements performed at: (i) the agricultural sites managed by Institute of Plant Acclimatization and Husbandry (ZDHAR) in Grodkowice (Malopolska, Poland), and (ii) the urban sites located in Kraków, Poland.\nFor agricultural measurements, several sites have been selected for measurements of N2O emissions during two campaigns – in spring and autumn 2014. The investigated crops were chosen to represent the regional agriculture and included wheat, canola and maize under various tillage conditions, as well as an uncultivated grassland as a control site.\nFor urban environment, measurement campaigns have been performed at the university’s campus lawn and at a large urban meadow, both located in the centre of Kraków agglomeration. The sites were chosen to be representative of the urban green areas typical of Central Europe.\nThe static chamber method was chosen to quantify soil-atmosphere N2O fluxes. Chamber enclosures have been performed every 3-5 days, depending on the conditions prevailing at the sites during the intermediate periods. From each enclosure, five 50-ml air samples have been collected for subsequent analysis of nitrous oxide concentrations. Well-established gas chromatography methods, with a precision of a single N2O measurement better than 0.5 ppb were employed. The measured concentrations were then used in a linear emission model to calculate N2O fluxes.\nResults of agricultural campaigns show large variability of N2O emissions, with maximum fluxes in the order of 120 ng N-N2O m-2 s-1, driven mainly by availability of nitrogen in soil and water. For fertilized sites, largest emissions values were observed several days after the rainfall events. Notable differences between sites under alternative tillage techniques have been observed.\nObservations at the urban sites revealed significant fluxes of N2O, with average daily values in some cases exceeding those observed at agricultural fields.",

            "abstract": "The chemical composition of the lakes on Titan is still poorly determined. Liquid ethane and methane may be abundant with the presence of other organic species from atmospheric precipitation, such as complex organic materials similar to Titan's tholins.\nWhile VIMS is still providing data on the surface of Titan, it is important to study how the deposits of the atmospheric organic aerosols may interact optically and chemically with the hydrocarbons lakes.\nIn this work, we present the results of laboratory experiments examining the spectroscopic signatures of a liquid ethane, liquid methane and the mixture of both in contact with laboratory analogs of Titan’s aerosols (Titan's tholins). Experiments were performed in the Titan's lakes simulation chamber of the W.M Keck laboratory at the University of Arkansas, at temperatures relevant to Titan's surface (90-94 K) and under a pressure maintained at 1.5 bar N2 atmosphere. The optical behavior of the sample was monitored via FTIR spectroscopy, in the near-infrared from 2.5 to 1.0 µm (4000-10000 cm-1).\nThe results for tholins in liquid ethane show modifications of the ethane bands essentially through flattening and broadening of bands at 1.7 - 1.75 µm and 2.0 µm. In liquid methane, the presence of tholins is observed through a broadening of the CH4 bands between 1.8 and 1.6 µm and a positive slope at 2.0 μm These features might allow tholins identification in Titan's lakes. Results in mixture of liquid CH4-C2H6 will be also presented. During the experiments, we have observed that tholins when in contact with these solvents are not remaining in suspension. In this case, the refractory material of Titan’s aerosols would not be dissolved in the Titan's surface lakes and seas but would rather sinks. Our experimental approach and its resulting data are relevant in regards to current VIMS observations of Titan’s lakes and proposed future missions to Titan like the ESA’s Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM).",

            "abstract": "Several earthquake early warning algorithms are in operation in various countries. Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Engineering Institute (KOERI) implemented and recently running three different EEWS within KOERI network in Marmara Region. Due to high probability of an earthquake with Mw > 7 in the next 30 years in the Marmara Sea, there is an urgent need to evaluate existing EEWS performance and to find out how reliable an EEW is in terms of calculating time, location, magnitude of an earthquake in the region. Here we assessed performance of Virtual Seismologist (VS), Earthquake Alarm System-2 (ElarmS-2) and PRobabilistic and Evolutionary early warning SysTem (PRESTo) which are developed at Caltech, UC Berkeley and University of Naples respectively and are being monitored for over six months. We choose four representative earthquakes that are detected by three algorithm and evaluated their performances. We found each algorithm has its own strengths and weakness in calculating source parameters. Even though, algorithms are not optimized, cities around the Marmara Sea could get up to 50 seconds warning time with existing infrastructure. First alert could be given in 12 seconds after origin time and blind-zone could get minimum 40 km radius. The main reason of delays on detecting earthquake is packet size of data (7 seconds in average). We confirm that SeisComp3 platform requires additional time to locate earthquakes and it needs to be optimized for EEWS. This study could help algorithm developer of three EEWS to optimize their systems in other seismically active region and different earthquake environment. We believe results derived from this study will provide precious information for both habitants in Marmara region and geo-scientist.",

            "abstract": "Chaos theory is a popular method in hydrologic time series prediction. Local model (LM) based on this theory utilizes time-delay embedding to reconstruct the phase-space diagram. For this method, its efficacy is dependent on the embedding parameters, i.e. embedding dimension, time lag, and nearest neighbor number. The optimal estimation of these parameters is thus critical to the application of Local model. However, these embedding parameters are conventionally estimated using Average Mutual Information (AMI) and False Nearest Neighbors (FNN) separately. This may leads to local optimization and thus has limitation to its prediction accuracy. Considering about these limitation, this paper applies a local model combined with simulated annealing (SA) to find the global optimization of embedding parameters. It is also compared with another global optimization approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA). These proposed hybrid methods are applied in daily and monthly streamflow time series for examination. The results show that global optimization can contribute to the local model to provide more accurate prediction results compared with local optimization. The LM combined with SA shows more advantages in terms of its computational efficiency. The proposed scheme here can also be applied to other fields such as prediction of hydro-climatic time series, error correction, etc.",

            "abstract": "Large juvenile bombs and lithic clasts, produced and ejected during explosive volcanic eruptions, follow ballistic trajectories. Of particular interest are: 1) the determination of ejection velocity and launch angle, which give insights into shallow conduit conditions and geometry; 2) particle trajectories, with an eye on trajectory evolution caused by collisions between bombs, as well as the interaction between bombs and ash/gas plumes; and 3) the computation of the final emplacement of bomb-sized clasts, which is important for hazard assessment and risk management.\n Ground-based imagery from a single camera only allows the reconstruction of bomb trajectories in a plan perpendicular to the line of sight, which may lead to underestimation of bomb velocities and does not allow the directionality of the ejections to be studied. To overcome this limitation, we adapted photogrammetry techniques to reconstruct 3D bomb trajectories from two or three synchronized high-speed video cameras. In particular, we modified existing algorithms to consider the errors that may arise from the very high velocity of the particles and the impossibility of measuring tie points close to the scene. Our method was tested during two field campaigns at Stromboli. In 2014, two high-speed cameras with a 500 Hz frame rate and a ~2 cm resolution were set up ~350m from the crater, 10° apart and synchronized. The experiment was repeated with similar parameters in 2015, but using three high-speed cameras in order to significantly reduce uncertainties and allow their estimation.\n Trajectory analyses for tens of bombs at various times allowed for the identification of shifts in the mean directivity and dispersal angle of the jets during the explosions. These time evolutions are also visible on the permanent video-camera monitoring system, demonstrating the applicability of our method to all kinds of explosive volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "The global forest ecosystem, which acts as a large carbon sink, plays an important role in modeling the global carbon balance. An accurate estimation of the total forest carbon stock in the aboveground biomass (AGB) is therefore necessary to improve our understanding of carbon dynamics, especially against the background of global climate change. The forest area of China is among the top five globally. However, because of limitations in forest AGB mapping methods and the availability of ground inventory data, there is still a lack in nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB estimation map for China. In this study, we collected over 8000 ground inventory data from the literature, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of these ground inventory data, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data, optical imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data. An uncertainty field model was introduced into the forest AGB mapping model to minimize the influence of plot locality uncertainty. Our nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB mapping results show that the forest AGB density in China is 120 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 61 Mg/ha. Evaluation with an independent ground inventory dataset showed that our proposed method can accurately map wall-to-wall forest AGB across a large landscape. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error between our predicted results and the validation dataset were 0.75 and 42.39 Mg/ha, respectively. This new method and the resulting nationwide wall-to-wall AGB map will help to improve the accuracy of carbon dynamic predictions in China.",

            "abstract": "The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; ~40.1 Ma) is a transient global warming event that abruptly reversed the long-term Eocene cooling trend. The primary driving mechanism(s) must be linked to a CO2 increase; however, geochemical modeling experiments show that prevailing hypotheses are incompatible with the paleoclimate record. To further examine changes in deep-sea carbonate burial, we identify the MECO for the first time at ODP Site 929 (Equatorial Atlantic; ~3935 m paleodepth) and present new lithological and geochemical data for this site, including benthic foraminiferal stable isotopes (δ18O and δ13C), XRF scanning data, and an orbitally tuned age model. We combine these records with data from a suite of Atlantic sites to form a depth transect between ~2-4 km (DSDP Site 523, ODP Site 1260 and 1263, IODP Site U1404) representing the first detailed record of carbonate dissolution in the Atlantic spanning the MECO. This compilation reveals dissolution at water depths as shallow as ~2 km (>1 km shallower than previous estimates) with multiple and discrete short-lived (<100 kyr) phases of carbonate compensation depth (CCD) shoaling during and after the event. Careful reevaluation of the Pacific CCD records combined with new results suggests similar short-term variability and magnitude of shoaling globally. These data provide new constraints on carbon release history during the MECO and, potentially, the forcing mechanisms for warming. The transient CCD shoaling events indicate multiple pulses of carbon input and acidification decoupled from deep-sea δ18O and δ13C records, indicating that these events must not have been driven directly by changes in temperature or carbon burial/storage – potentially reconciling some of the data–model discrepancies.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are transitional ecosystems between terrestrial and marine environments. Along with mangroves and other vegetated coastal habitats, salt marshes rank among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, with critical global importance for the planet’s carbon cycle. Fluorescence was used to examine the quality of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) exchanging between a tidal creek in a created salt marsh and its adjacent estuary in eastern North Carolina, USA. Samples from the creek were collected hourly over four tidal cycles in May, July, August, and October of 2011. Absorbance and fluorescence of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and of base-extracted POM (BEPOM) served as the tracers for organic matter quality while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and base-extracted particulate organic carbon (BEPOC) were used to compute fluxes. Fluorescence was modeled using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and principle components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC results. Of nine PARAFAC components modeled, we used multiple linear regression to identify tracers for recalcitrant DOM; labile soil-derived source DOM; detrital POM; and planktonic POM. Based on mass balance, recalcitrant DOC export was 86 g C m-2 yr-1 and labile DOC export was 49 g C m-2 yr-1. The marsh also exported 41 g C m-2 yr-1 of detrital terrestrial POC, which likely originated from lands adjacent to the North River estuary. Planktonic POC export from the marsh was 6 g C m-2 yr-1. Using the DOM and POM quality results obtained via fluorescence measurements and scaling up to global salt marsh area, we estimated that the potential release of CO2 from the respiration of salt marsh DOC and POC transported to estuaries could be 11 Tg C yr-1, roughly 4% of the recently estimated CO2 release for marshes and estuaries globally.",

            "abstract": "Lin-Bien river basin is one of the most sediment hazard-prone river basins in southern Taiwan. Typhoon Morakot in 2009 firstly brought over 2,500mm rainfall in this river basin and caused a large number of sediment in the upstream area. After 2009, large sediment disasters occurred annually and damaged or buried community located in the middle and upstream areas, especially one of the most serious events in 2010. However, more sediment occurred and affected meddle and downstream area during 2010 event than the one in 2009 even though more precipitation in 2009. In order to clarify the sediment amount changes in this river basin, author aims to focus on landslide and debris flow in the upstream area. To estimate the sediment amount by landslide and debris flow, TRIGRS and Flo-2D were used. TRIGRS is for landslide and Flo-2D is for debris flow. The sediment amount changes during 2009 and 2013 were analyzed and the total sediment amount was estimated by landslide volume, debris flow volume by part of landslide. In order to have more reliable and precisely sediment estimation amount under continuous typhoon events scenario, topographic changes were analyzed by history disaster data, image data, and landslide inventory.\nFinally, the author also collects data by field investigation. The sediment variation estimation model is finally constructed by the two numerical models. By this model, it is possible to estimate the probable sediment amount under climate change scenario. This is also significant results to discuss the long-term variation of sediment amount in a small catchment.",

Field investigations, trench excavations, and radiocarbon dating results reveal that: (i) the Qingchuan fault is currently active as a seismogenic fault, along which six morphogenic earthquakes occurred in the past 6000 years; (ii) the most recent event prior to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake took place in the period between AD 600 and 1400, which probably corresponds to the late Tang-Song (AD 800–1000) (M~8) earthquake that occurred in the central and southwestern segments of the LSTB; (iii) the penultimate paleoseismic event occurred in the period around 2000 yr BP, suggesting a millennium recurrence interval of morphogenic earthquakes in the late Holocene. The present results are comparable with those inferred in the central and southwestern segments of the LSTB within which the Wenchuan–magnitude earthquakes occurred in a millennium recurrence interval, that are in contrast with previous estimates of 2000-10,000 years for the recurrence interval of morphogenic earthquakes within the LSTB, and thereby necessitating substantial modifications to exiting seismic-hazard models for the densely populated region at the Sichuan region.\n",

            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, new developments in sensing technologies resulted in a massive increase of available data in environmental science and the increase is still ongoing. In the very near future, new satellite missions will provide data of global coverage in a hitherto unknown degree of detail. Wireless sensing technologies offer today the possibility to observe dynamics of soil-related state variables in highest spatial and temporal resolution. Mobile sensing technologies allow the exploration of larger areas in shorter times. On the other hand, the Open Data movement removes permission barriers and data become more and more freely available, opening up new possibilities for data integration.\nAll this fosters new ambitions but also new challenges for environmental science. Bigger data allows us to ask bigger questions. But, a larger amount of data on its own is worthless. New approaches and methods to handle, structure, analyze, visualize, and to integrate the data into models are needed. And, many of the potential answers are no longer accessible analytically or experimentally. Big Data mining in soil science has specific challenges on its own. The data are often highly heterogeneous, resulting from observations at different spatial and temporal scales, representing the result of highly complex interactions and feedbacks between different environmental compartments. In view of this complexity, asking the “right” question can become a very challenging task.\nBig Data mining does not replace the need for profound understanding of processes. Collaboration across different scientific disciplines might be crucial to include all relevant knowledge. From this perspective, Big Data science is a supplement but not a substitute for traditional process-related studies and data-collection. The talk will attempt to shed some light on challenges and potentials of Big Data science from the perspective of traditional soil hydrological science.",

            "abstract": "Wet polycrystalline quartz aggregates deformed at temperatures T of 600°-900°C and strain rates of 10-4-10-6 s-1 at a confining pressure Pc of 1.5 GPa exhibit plasticity at low T, governed by dislocation glide and limited recovery, and grain size-sensitive creep at high T, governed by diffusion and sliding at grain boundaries. Quartz aggregates were HIP-synthesized, subjecting natural milky quartz powder to T=900°C and Pc=1.5 GPa, and grain sizes (2 to 25 mm) were varied by annealing at these conditions for up to 10 days. Infrared absorption spectra exhibit a broad OH band at 3400 cm-1 due to molecular water inclusions with a calculated OH content (~4000 ppm, H/106Si) that is unchanged by deformation. Rate-stepping experiments reveal different stress-strain rate functions at different temperatures and grain sizes, which correspond to differing stress-temperature sensitivities. At 600-700°C and grain sizes of 5-10 mm, flow law parameters compare favorably with those for basal <a> plasticity and dislocation creep of wet quartzites (effective stress exponents n of 3 to 6 and activation enthalpy H* ~150 kJ/mol). Deformed samples show undulatory extinction, limited recrystallization, and c-axis maxima parallel to the shortening direction. Similarly fine-grained samples deformed at 800°-900°C exhibit flow parameters n=1.3-2.0 and H*=135-200 kJ/mol corresponding to grain size-sensitive Newtonian creep. Deformed samples show some undulatory extinction and grain sizes change by recrystallization; however, grain boundary deformation processes are indicated by the low value of n. Our experimental results for grain size-sensitive creep can be compared with models of grain boundary diffusion and grain boundary sliding using measured rates of silicon grain boundary diffusion. While many quartz mylonites show microstructural and textural evidence for dislocation creep, results for grain size-sensitive creep may apply to very fine-grained (<10 mm) quartz mylonites.",

            "abstract": "Massive dust emitted from Sahara desert is carried by trade winds across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Amazon Rainforest and Caribbean Sea. Airborne dust degrades air quality and interacts with radiation and clouds. Dust falling to land and ocean adds essential nutrients that could increase the productivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and modulate the biogeochemical cycles and climate. The resultant climate change will feed back on the production of dust in Sahara desert and its subsequent transport and deposition. Understanding the connections among the remote ecosystems requires an accurate quantification of dust transport and deposition flux on large spatial and temporal scales, in which satellite remote sensing can play an important role. We provide the first multiyear satellite-based estimates of altitude-resolved across-Atlantic dust transport and deposition based on eight-year (2007-2014) record of aerosol three-dimensional distributions from the CALIPSO lidar. On a basis of the 8-year average, 179 Tg (million tons) of dust leaves the coast of North Africa and is transported across Atlantic Ocean, of which 102, 20, and 28 Tg of dust is deposited into the tropical Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Amazon Rainforest, respectively. The dust deposition adds 4.3 Tg of iron and 0.1 Tg of phosphorus to the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea where the productivity of marine ecosystem depends on the availability of these nutrients. The 28 Tg of dust provides about 0.022 Tg of phosphorus to Amazon Rainforest yearly that replenishes the leak of this plant-essential nutrient by rains and flooding, suggesting an important role of Saharan dust in maintaining the productivity of Amazon rainforest on timescales of decades or centuries. We will also discuss seasonal and interannual variations of the dust transport and deposition, and comparisons of the CALIOP-based estimates with model simulations.",

            "abstract": "It is increasingly recognised that groundwater (GW) in montane watersheds has a major influence on the distribution of vegetation communities and ecosystem function, as well as sustaining downstream river flows. In glaciated landscapes, complex and heterogenous drift deposits can have a dominant influence on GW stores and fluxes, and form a poorly understood component of the critical zone. Given the logistical problems and limitations of drilling observation wells in such terrain, hydrogeophysics has outstanding potential to help characterise aquifer structure and understand shallow GW in the critical zone of montane environments.\nWe present the results of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys in an intensively monitored 3.2km2 watershed in the Scottish Highlands with a strong glacial past. We sought to characterise the structure and spatial organisation of GW stores in diverse quaternary drift deposits. This utilized distributed ERT transects that provided a basis for spatial interpolation using geostatistical methods and high resolution LiDAR surveys. Some transects coincided with shallow observation wells that were used to “ground-truth” the inversion of resistivity data. The surveys showed that the drifts covered around 70% of the catchment and varied from 5m deep on the hillslopes to 40m in the valleys. The water table was within 0.2m of the soil surface in the valley bottom areas and about 1.5m deep on steeper hillslopes. The water content of drifts inferred by the ERT surveys and characterisation of the aquifer properties showed highest water content in the peat (~80%) and basal till (20-30%), and low storage in moraine deposits (10%). Upscaling these estimates of inferred storage to the catchment scale indicated around ~2-3 m of GW storage, equivalent to around 4-6 years of effective precipitation. This generally compared well with independent storage estimates inferred from long-term stable isotope time series collected from the aquifers. Elucidating the importance of the critical zone for water storage in montane environments using ERT provides a basis for predicting their likely resistance and resilience to environmental change. This is of practical importance in the Scottish uplands where both climate and land use change are likely to have implications for water availability.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice is a platform for snow to accumulate on and, because this platform moves and deforms with ocean currents and winds, its snow cover is astoundingly heterogeneous. Snow processes on sea ice have crucial consequences in driving the evolution of sea ice, at a cascade of temporal and spatial scales.\nAlthough sea ice models have been developed for decades, the representation of snow in these models has remained under-addressed. This work is a contribution toward the improvement of the snow component in large-scale sea ice models. During the past few years, representations of snow physics of intermediate complexity were introduced in models of this kind, providing the tools to assess the influence of snow on sea ice. The importance, in particular, of accounting for snow stratigraphy, scattering properties and wind-driven snow processes in models has been shown using those tools. These processes are all necessary in order to realistically simulate the evolution of sea ice and, more specifically, perennial sea ice.\nThis work opens the way for snow-related improvements in climate models and provides modellers with some guidance in achieving this task. However, extensive In Situ observations are required to adequately constrain snow parameterizations and better quantify of the impacts of snow processes on sea ice. As such specific observations start to become available, we recommend some directions for using them in future investigations and model developments.",

            "abstract": "Regional Chemical transport models (CTM) are used extensively for modeling of Ozone concentration. WRF/Chem is one such CTM that includes various chemical mechanisms and is used for simulation of Ozone and other pollutant concentration at desired time step. This study focuses on the robustness of WRF/Chem simulated Ozone concentrations over a sub-tropical urban airshed of megacity Delhi. Detailed analysis has been presented for the veracity of two different chemical mechanisms namely; Carbon Bond Mechanism (CBMZ) and Regional Atmospheric Chemical Model (RACM). It was observed that simulated Ozone concentrations are better predicted with CBMZ mechanism and is highly sensitive to the rate constants. The value of statistical parameter RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for modeled Ozone concentration with CBMZ mechanism was 32.97 µg m-3 and for RACM was 40 .13 µg m-3. Similarly, value of IOA (Index of Agreement) was also better for CBMZ (0.82) in comparison to RACM (0.55). The Ozone concentrations are analyzed for precursors such as Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Carbon-monoxide (CO) as well as temperature considering their strong dependence on Ozone formation. A consistent positive correlation between Ozone concentration and temperature is noted whereas; NOx and CO show inverse relationship with Ozone. Further, Ozone concentration range vis-à-vis model performance is scrutinized. A poor model for low Ozone concentration levels is observed and a highly satisfactory for moderate Ozone concentration levels while satisfactory for higher Ozone levels. Despite of the limitations observed during model evaluation of Ozone predictions for low Ozone levels, it is concluded that WRF/Chem could effectively be applied for understanding its trends, tropospheric chemistry and air quality assessment for regulatory purposes at moderate Ozone concentration levels. Further, it is recommended that model implementation shall be made for policy decisions cautiously with due consideration to the magnitudes of Ozone levels present in the study domain and the performance measures in the specific concentration range.",

            "abstract": "We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The BFAST framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in regimes. To further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil. Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984-2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized RMSE of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond. Spatial and temporal patterns were further analysed with an ecological perspective in a follow-up study. Results show that changes in land use patterns such as land use intensification and reduced agricultural expansion reflect the socio-economic transformations that occurred in the region",

Here we present a suite of high resolution (1-15µm/voxel) 3D x-ray tomography data from tube pumices that enable us to piece together this complex deformation history. Qualitative visualization and quantitative geometric analysis of each individual bubble (10’s of thousands per 3D volume) in the images reveals complex internal morphologies and bubble interactions; many features of which are not preserved during traditional sample preparation. Even in this end member example of tube pumices where simple shear is dominant, we can identify complex and spatially variable deformation during ascent, and multiple stages of spatially variable brittle and ductile deformation. From relationships between bubble size, geometry, and elongation we define variably orientated but strong deformation perpendicular to the tube axis. From this we define the evolving stress field and identify implying temporal and spatial variability in bubble deformation. The data indicate complex responses to changing stress fields, with significant strain localization, including significant “kink band” late stage shortening along the major elongation axis, and we interpret this information to better understand the physico-chemical conditions and mechanisms operating during explosive volcanism.",

Through the calibration of a reactive transport model of these experiments, we show that: i) biodegradation of diffusion-controlled pesticide fluxes is favored by a high Damköhler number (high reaction rate compared to flux rate); ii) abiotic sorption processes are negligible and do not interact strongly with biodegradation; iii) biodegradation is primarily governed by the initial repartition of pesticide and degraders for diffusion-controlled transport, as diffusion greatly limits the flux of pesticide reaching the microbial hotspot due to dilution.

            "abstract": "Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important contributors to rainfall in the High Plains of the United States as well as producers of severe weather such as hail, tornados and straight-line wind events known as derechos. Past studies have shown that changes in aerosol concentrations serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) alter the MCS hydrometeor characteristics which in turn modify precipitation yield, downdraft velocity, cold-pool strength, storm propagation and the potential for severe weather to occur. In this study, the sensitivity of MCS precipitation characteristics and convective downburst velocities associated with a derecho to changes in CCN concentrations were examined by simulating a case study using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The case study of the 8 May 2009 “Super-Derecho” MCS was chosen since it produced a swath of widespread wind damage in association with an embedded large-scale bow echo, over a broad region from the High Plains of western Kansas to the foothills of the Appalachians. The sensitivity of the storm to changes in CCN concentrations was examined by conducting a set of three simulations which differed in the initial aerosol concentration based on output from the 3D chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. Results from this study indicate that while increasing CCN concentrations led to an increase in precipitation rates, the changes to the derecho strength were not linear. A moderate increase in aerosol concentration reduced the derecho strength, while the simulation with the highest aerosol concentrations increased the derecho intensity. These changes are attributed to the impact of enhanced CCN concentration on the production of convective downbursts. An analysis of aerosol loading impacts on these MCS features will be presented.",

The interpreted directions and great circles can be combined using the iterative procedure of (McFadden and McElhinny, 1988). The resulting magnetic directions can be used in the statistics portal or exported as raw tabulated data and figures.\nThe available tools in the statistics portal cover standard Fisher statistics for directional data and virtual geomagnetic poles (Fisher, 1953; Butler, 1992; Deenen et al., 2011). Other tools include the eigenvector approach foldtest (Tauxe and Watson, 1994), a bootstrapped reversal test (Tauxe et al., 2009), and the classical reversal test of (McFadden and McElhinny, 1990). An implementation exists for the detection and correction of inclination shallowing in sediments (Tauxe and Kent, 2004; Tauxe et al., 2008) and a module to visualize custom or default APWP reference frames (Torsvik et al., 2012; Kent and Irving, 2010; Besse and Courtillot, 2002) for continent-bearing plates.\nPaleomagnetism.org provides an integrated approach for researchers to export tabulated and visualized (e.g. equal area projections) paleomagnetic data. The portals construct a custom exportable file that can be shared with other researchers and included in public databases. With a publication, this custom file can be appended and would contain all data used in the respective publication. The appended file can then be imported to the Paleomagnetims.org application by other researchers. The accessibility and simplicity through which paleomagnetic data can be interpreted, analyzed, visualized, and shared should make Paleomagnetism.org of interest to the paleomagnetic community.",

            "abstract": "  Junggar Basin is located in the central part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Its basement nature is a highly controversial scientific topic, involving the basic style and processes of crustal growth.\nBased on the borehole data from over 300 wells drilled into the Carboniferous System, together with the high-resolution gravity and magnetic data (in a 1:50,000 scale), we made a detailed analysis of the basement structure, formation timing and process and later evolution on basis of core geochemical and isotopic analysis. Firstly, we defined the Mahu Precambrian micro-continental block in the juvenile crust of Junggar Basin according to the Hf isotopic analysis of the Carboniferous volcanic rocks. Secondly, the results of the tectonic setting and basin analysis suggest that the Junggar area incorporates three approximately E-W trending island arc belts (from north to south: Yemaquan–Wulungu–Chingiz, Jiangjunmiao–Luliang–Darbut and Zhongguai–Mosuowan–Baijiahai–Qitai respectively) and intervened three approximately E-W trending retro-arc or inter-arc basin belts from north to south, such as Santanghu–Suosuoquan–Emin, Wucaiwan–Dongdaohaizi–Mahu (Mahu block sunk as a bathyal basin during this phase) and Fukang–western well Pen1 accordingly. Thirdly, the closure of these retro-arc or inter-arc basins gradually toward the south led to the occurrence of collision and amalgamation of the above-mentioned island arcs during the Carboniferous, constituting the basic framework of the Junggar “block”. Fourthly, the emplacement of large-scale mantle-derived magmas occurred in the latest Carboniferous or Early Permian. For instance, the well Mahu 5 penetrate the latest Carboniferous basalts with a thickness of over 20m, and these mantle-derived magmas concreted the above-mentioned island arc-collaged body. Therefore, the Junggar basin basement mainly comprises pre-Carboniferous collaged basement, and its formation is characterized by two-stage growth model, involving the Carboniferous lateral growth of island arcs and the latest Carboniferous to Early Permian vertical crustal growth related to emplacement and underplating of the mantle-derived magmas.\n ",

            "abstract": "Ecological dynamics across the Arctic are responding to rapid changes in climate. As a whole, the Arctic has warmed at approximately twice the rate of the rest of the world, but changes in temperature and precipitation experienced at regional and local scales are most important for coupled human-natural systems. In addition, biologically-relevant climate indices are necessary for quantifying ecological responses of terrestrial and aquatic systems to varying climate. We compared climatic changes at six different Arctic and sub-Arctic locations, including two in Greenland (Kangerlussuaq, Sisimiut), one in Sweden (Abisko), and three in Alaska (Barrow, Nome, Fairbanks). We amassed weather data (daily temperature and precipitation), dating as far back as 1906, from public-access databases and used these data to calculate indices such as length of growing season, growing season degree days (GDD), and growing season precipitation. Annual GDD increased at all locations (average of 13% increase in GDD since 1980), but especially in western Greenland (16 and 37% in Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut, respectively). Changes in growing season precipitation were more variable, with only Barrow, AK and Abisko, Sweden experiencing increased precipitation. All other sites experienced stable or slightly declining precipitation. Increasing temperatures and relatively stable precipitation translates to increased evapotranspiration potential, which influences soil moisture, lake depth, vegetation, carbon emissions, and fire susceptibility. Understanding local and regional trends in temperature and precipitation can help explain observed phenological changes and other processes at population, community, and ecosystem levels. In addition, identification of locations most susceptible to future change will allow scientists to closely monitor their ecological dynamics, anticipate changes in coupled human-natural systems, and consider adaptation plans for the most rapidly changing systems.",

            "abstract": "The polyphase Paleogene Eurekan deformational history in the Arctic represents a complex sequence of successive tectonic stages, which produced a number of intra-continental deformation zones with changing, sometimes opposing, lateral, oblique, and convergent kinematics along the involved plate boundaries in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, North Greenland, and Svalbard. The Eurekan deformation is characterized by different structural styles with the development of fold-and-thrust belts in Spitsbergen and in the Canadian Arctic, distinct compressional thrust zones in North Greenland and Ellesmere Island, large systems of strike-slip fault zones in Spitsbergen, Northeast Greenland and Ellesmere Island, and the combination of both compressional and lateral fault zones in northern Ellesmere Island.\nEurekan tectonism was caused by the opening and continuous evolution of the Eurasian Basin in connection with the development of the Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay and the North Atlantic Ocean spreading ridges. The following tectonic stages can be distinguished which are responsible for the Eurekan deformation:\n - Pre-Eurekan Stage: sea-floor spreading in Labrador Sea and rifting in Baffin Bay, Norwegian/Greenland seas and the Eurasian Basin (100-53 Ma).\n- Eurekan Stage 1: sea-floor spreading and transform faults around Greenland resulted in a NE-directed movement with (a) sinistral transpression along Nares Strait and probably sinistral motion along the fault zones parallel to the north margin of Ellesmere Island, and (b) compression at the West Spitsbergen Fold-and-Thrust Belt (53–47 Ma).\n- Eurekan Stage 2: NW-wards directed movement of Greenland with (a) compression along Nares Strait and parts of Ellesmere Island combined with dextral motions parallel to the continental margin of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (b) and dextral strike-slip tectonics along Fram Strait (47–34 Ma).\n- Post-Eurekan Stage: termination of sea-floor spreading in Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay and separation of Greenland and Svalbard.\nThe Eurekan deformation can be defined as being the result of plate-tectonic movements during the simultaneous sea-floor spreading in Baffin Bay/Labrador Sea, the North Atlantic and the Eurasian Basin, when Greenland was a separate plate surrounded by active plate boundaries 53 and 34 Ma ago.",

            "abstract": "The seismicity of Bhutan is characterized by the apparent lack of great earthquakes and a significantly lower activity compared to most other parts of the Himalayan arc. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of this anomalously low activity and to relate it with possible along-strike differences in the structure of the orogenic belt, a temporary network with up to 38 broadband seismometers was installed in Bhutan between January 2013 and November 2014.\nIn this work we present a catalog of local and regional earthquakes detected and located with the GANSSER network complemented by regional stations in India, Bangladesh, and China. State-of-the-art data analysis and earthquake location procedures were applied to derive a high-precision earthquake catalog of Bhutan and surrounding regions. Focal mechanisms from regional moment tensor inversions and first-motion polarities complement the earthquake catalog.\nIn the vicinity of the Shumar-Kuru Chu Spur in East Bhutan, seismicity forms a moderately dipping structure at about 12 km depth, which we associate with the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). North of 27.6°N the dip of the structure steepens, which can be interpreted as a ramp along the MHT. In West Bhutan seismicity occurs at depths of 20 to 40 km and receiver function images indicate that seismicity occurs in the underthrusting Indian crust rather than on the MHT. The highest seismic activity is clustered along the Goalpara Lineament, a dextral NE-SW striking shear zone in southwest Bhutan, which appears to connect to the western edge of the Shillong Plateau in the foreland. Focal depths indicate that this shear zone is located at depths of 20-30 km and therefore in the underthrusting Indian crust.\nPreliminary results of a 3D local earthquake tomography show substantial differences in the uppermost crust between east and west Bhutan. Consistent with our receiver function images, the results also indicate a thinning of the crustal root towards eastern Bhutan.",

            "abstract": "Most analyses of Antarctic sea ice in simulations of the CMIP5 archive have so far been oriented towards the quantification of the disagreement between model results and sea ice observations only. Since the decomposition of those biases into distinct physical components is necessary to understand their origins, we propose here an ocean-sea ice-atmosphere integrated and process-oriented approach. Not only the biases in variables essential to the sea ice seasonal evolution are estimated regionally with regard to observations, but their contributions to the sea ice concentration budget are estimated.\nFollowing a previously developed method, the sea ice concentration balance over the autumn-winter seasons is decomposed into four terms, including the sea ice concentration change during the period of interest, advection, divergence and a residual accounting for the net contribution of thermodynamics and ice deformation. Concurrently, correlations between trends in ocean temperature at depth and trends in ice concentration are calculated directly from various model output fields (including CMIP5 models) to disentangle the role of ice-ocean interactions.\nResults show that the geographical patterns of all mean sea ice concentration budget terms over 1992-2005 are in qualitative agreement with the observed ones. Sea ice thermodynamic growth is maintained by horizontal divergence near the continent and in the central ice pack, whereas melting close to the ice edge is led by sea ice advection. However, significant errors in all budget terms are observed due to ice velocities that tend to be overestimated all around Antarctica in several models, leading to a relatively weak divergence in the inner ice pack and to an excessive advection in the marginal ice zone. Biases in ice drift speed and direction are ultimately related to biases in winds in all models.\nThis method paves the way for a systematic assessment of forthcoming CMIP6 sea ice model outputs in the Southern Hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Snow has a profound impact on permafrost and ecosystem functioning in the Arctic tundra. Characterizing snow depths and snow-water-equivalent (SWE) is difficult over a large area, since they are quite heterogeneous, particularly in ice-wedge polygonal ground. In this study, we explore various strategies to characterize snow depths and SWE, using multiscale observational platforms, including a snow probe, ground penetrating radar (GPR), unmanned aerial system (UAS) and ground/airborne LiDAR. In addition, our statistical analysis and data locations are designed such that we can characterize the snow heterogeneity in multiple spatial scales. We demonstrate our approach using the datasets collected in the ice-wedge polygonal tundra near Barrow, AK.\nWe first document the characteristics of each platform. GPR can cover ~100s meters, and also provide depth-averaged snow density. The UAS-based snow-surface elevation is used to estimate the snow depth over a larger area with much less labor than GPR. Snow density analysis, using both cores and GPR, suggests that the depth-averaged snow density is quite uniform over the site.\nThe spatial variability of snow depths is then quantified, and correlated with various topographic measures (e.g., curvature) from the LiDAR digital elevation map as well as the wind direction. We explore different scales of moving average to separate micro and macro-topography. Results show that the wind factor is not significant in our case, except for at the edge of a drained thaw-lake basin. The wind distribution fills microtopographic lows (i.e., troughs and centers of low-centered polygons) and creates a smooth snow surface following the macro-topography, which depends on polygon sizes.\nFinally, we develop a Bayesian geostatistical method to integrate these multiscale datasets for estimating snow depths and SWE over the study site (~1km by 1km). We compare two strategies: interpolating (1) the residual of the topographic correlations or (2) the snow surface. Results show that the former approach leads to more accurate estimates, suggesting the importance of considering macro and micro-topography to estimate snow depths and SWE. The estimated SWE is used in hydrological modeling, the results of which confirm the importance of considering the SWE heterogeneity for computing spring runoff.",

            "abstract": "The extrusion rate of lava at active volcanoes provides a principle control on the style of eruptive behavior and the extent of lava flows, while also providing information about magma supply to the volcano. Measurements of extrusion rate at active volcanoes are therefore important for assessing hazard, and improving understanding of volcanic systems.\nVolcán Reventador is an asymmetric stratovolcano in the Cordillera Real of Ecuador. The largest historically observed eruption at Reventador in 2002 has been followed by several periods of eruptive activity. Eruptions are characterised by effusion of andesitic to basaltic-andesitic lava flows, and Vulcanian explosions. The ongoing eruption at Reventador therefor provides an excellent target for investigating the link between effusion rate, explosivity, and lava flow behaviour. Satellite InSAR provides regular observations of the volcano, even during night or periods of cloud cover.\nWe use a dataset of Radarsat-2 and TanDEM-X imagery, with intervals of 11 to 192 days, over the period 2011 to 2014 to measure the extent, thickness and volume of new lava flows at Reventador. We use radar amplitude and inteferometric coherence to map 25 individual lava flows, as well as pyroclastic deposits and changes in lava dome morphology. We observe 43 Mm3 of deposits over a three year period, giving an average effusion rate of 0.5 m3s-1. We do not observe any ground deformation due to magmatic sources at Reventador, therefore variations in lava effusion rate can be interpreted as changes in the magma supply to the volcano.\nWe investigate the link between variations in effusion rate and the length, area, thickness, and aspect ratio of lava flows, and the explosive-effusive transition. We also characterise the relationship between lava flow age, thickness, and subsidence rate.",

            "abstract": "Among natural hazards, landslides represent a significant source of loss of life in mountainous terrains. Many regions of Latin America and the Caribbean are prone to landslide activity, due to strong topographic relief, high tectonic uplift rates, seismicity and/or climate. Further, vulnerable populations are often concentrated in deep valleys or mountain foothills susceptible to catastrophic landslides, with vulnerability further increased by dense urbanization and precarious settlements in some large cities.\nWhile historic extremely catastrophic events such as the 1999 Vargas flows in Venezuela or the 1970 Huascaran rock avalanche in Peru are commonly cited to characterize landslide hazards in this region, less known is the landslide activity in periods without such large disasters. This study assesses the occurrence of fatal landslides in Latin America and the Caribbean between 2004 and 2013. Over this time period we recorded 611 landslides that caused 11,631 deaths in 25 countries, mostly as a result of rainfall triggers. The countries with the highest number of fatal landslides are Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru and Haiti. The highest death toll for a single event was ca.3000. The dataset has not captured a strong El Niño event or large earthquakes in landslide prone areas, thus the analysis is indicative of short term rather than long term spatial and temporal patterns. Results show that at continental scale, the spatial distribution of landslides in the 2004-2013 period correlates well with relief, precipitation and population density, while the temporal distribution reflects the regional annual rainfall patterns. In urban areas, the presence of informal settlements has a big impact on the number of fatalities, while at national level weaker correlations with gross income, human development and corruption indices can be found.\nThis work was funded by the Durham International Fellowships for Research and Enterprise and Fondecyt project 1140317.",

            "abstract": "We use physical experiments to explore the onset and the morphology of submarine mass failure. Previous experiments found that cohesive sediment alters foreset mass-flow dynamics away from the regular, small avalanches characteristic of cohesionless grain flows to produce a broad range of mass failure events. Prefailure morphology is convex from the knick-point to the delta top. Failure initiates at the knick-point, erodes headward, and creates a scarp steeper than the initial profile. Normalized size of event-type failures does not correlate with water or sediment supply. Experiments also showed increased background creep with increased sediment supply. Building on these experiments, we examine how overpressure and focused fluid flow affect failure. Our initial system is hydrostatically pressured. Pore pressure is then increased in a confined, permeable layer to initiate failure. We hypothesize that the rate of overpressure increase correlates with the size of the initial failure. A rapid pressure increase will decrease the effective stress over a larger slope area before it dissipates. We also control clay content to evaluate the impact of cohesion on failure morphology and runout. We estimate that increased cohesion produces failure blocks that shear on discrete surfaces whereas decreased cohesion produces granular flows and longer runout. The experiments are designed to allow us to control sediment properties and to isolate individual parameters. Numerical models at the same scale of the physical experiments allow us to predict timing and location of failure based on hydrologic and strength properties and the rate of pressure increase in the permeable layer, in turn allowing us to test models that predict the onset of failure. Another suite of experiments aims to investigate pore pressure and slope stability in response to ground accelerations, a mechanism that is often invoked as triggering large submarine mass failure.",

            "abstract": "Appropriate descriptions of the mechanical, hydraulic and transport properties of rock fractures are crucial for accurate modelling of flow and transport processes. These properties are intrinsically coupled, related by the geometry of the fracture surface and the physical properties of the rock.\nUnderstanding this coupling is of particular importance, for example, when stimulating naturally low-permeable rocks, e.g. in the development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems or EGS. Natural and stimulated fractures under high pressure are rarely open. Hence, in deep geological systems, the fracture topography becomes a major determinant for the permeability and normal and shear stiffness of the rock. However, due to the variability in natural media; limited accessibility; and the influence of transient mechanical deformation, exact characterization of fractures sampled from deep reservoirs is often difficult, if not impossible.\nInstead, laboratory-scale investigations are often used as a proxy to provide insight into characteristic properties, and realistic value ranges for particular fracture properties, from which model parameters can be derived. However, the properties of fractures used laboratory studies depend on many factors: sample size, fracture origin and sampling methods, etc ... which poses the question: What experimental bias is introduced in such artificially generated samples?\nIn this presentation, we discuss a study comparing the properties of naturally and artificially generated rock fractures. The natural fractures were gathered by overcoring pre-existing fractures in otherwise intact granite samples obtained at depth, while the artificial fractures were generated from the same samples by Brazilian tests performed on intact sub-cores. We characterize and compare the topography of the various fracture types: both natural and artificial, and Mode I and Mode II fractures are considered. Fracture damage during cyclic loading of multiple samples is also presented and the influence of crack propagation on surface topography is investigated. We report results that illustrate the differences in surface roughness with impact on fluid flow, aperture and strength, as well as the scaling of fracture topography with samples of various sizes.",

            "abstract": "Forest fires emit pollutants that can influence downwind surface concentrations of ozone, with potential implications for exceeding air quality regulations. The influence of emissions from biogenic and anthropogenic sources that are mixed into a biomass burning plume as it travels downwind is not well understood. Using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry transport model and a novel method to track the centre of biomass burning plumes, we identify the chemical reactions that determine ozone production and loss along the plume trajectory. Using a series of sensitivity runs, we quantify the role of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions on the importance of individual chemical reactions. We illustrate the method using data collected during the BORTAS aircraft campaign over eastern Canada during summer 2011. We focus on two contrasting plume trajectories originating from the same multi-day fire in Ontario. The first plume trajectory on 16th July 2011 travels eastward from the fire and eventually mixes with anthropogenic emissions travelling up the east coast of the United States before outflow over the North Atlantic. The second plume trajectory we follow is three days later and travels eastward with a strong northeast component away from large anthropogenic sources. Both trajectories are influenced by downwind biogenic emissions. We generate a chemical reaction narrative for each plume trajectory, allowing is to quantify how mixing pyrogenic, biogenic and anthropogenic emissions influences downwind ozone photochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Surface ozone pollution is one of the major environmental concerns due to its damaging effects on human and vegetation. One of the largest uncertainties of future surface ozone prediction comes from its interaction with vegetation under a changing climate. Ozone can be modulated by vegetation through, e.g., biogenic emissions, dry deposition and transpiration. These processes are in turn affected by chronic exposure to ozone via lowered photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance. Both ozone and vegetation growth are expected to be altered by climate change. To better understand these climate-ozone-vegetation interactions and possible feedbacks on ozone itself via vegetation, we implement an online ozone-vegetation scheme [Lombardozzi et al., 2015] into the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with active atmospheric chemistry, climate and land surface components. Previous overestimation of surface ozone in eastern US, Canada and Europe is shown to be reduced by >8 ppb, reflecting improved model-observation comparison. Simulated surface ozone is lower by 3.7 ppb on average globally. Such reductions (and improvements) in simulated ozone are caused mainly by lower isoprene emission arising from reduced leaf area index in response to chronic ozone exposure. Effects via transpiration are also potentially significant but require better characterization. Such findings suggest that ozone-vegetation interaction may substantially alter future ozone simulations, especially under changing climate and ambient CO2 levels, which would further modulate ozone-vegetation interactions. Inclusion of such interactions in Earth system models is thus necessary to give more realistic estimation and prediction of surface ozone. This is crucial for better policy formulation regarding air quality, land use and climate change mitigation.\n",

            "abstract": "Global increasing demand of palm oil is leading to the expansion of oil palm plantations, particularly in SE Asia, which in Sumatran lowlands has resulted in a 21% forest area loss. Large photosynthesis rates are expected for oil palms, due to their high growth and yield production. However, there is very limited information on their effect on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and their sink or source strength at ecosystem scale. For methane (CH4) fluxes, research has mainly focused in oil palm plantations located on peatlands, but no information is available at ecosystem level from plantations on mineral soils.\nWith the aim of studying CO2 fluxes during the non-productive and productive phases of oil palm cultivation, an eddy covariance (EC) tower was installed in a 2 year old oil palm plantation, where it was measuring for 8 months, and was subsequently moved to a 12 year old plantation, both in the province of Jambi, Sumatra. The EC system consisted of a Licor 7500A and an ultrasonic Metek anemometer, operating at 10 Hz, installed on a 7m and 22m tower respectively. In the 12 year old plantation, the tower was also equipped with a Los Gatos FGGA-24EP, to assess CH4 fluxes. Chamber measurements were also carried out to obtain information on respiration and CH4 fluxes from the soil.\nRadiation was the major driver controlling net carbon uptake, while soil moisture did not play a significant role. Average net ecosystem exchange in the hours of the day with higher radiation for the whole measurement period was 10 µmol m-2 s-1 for the 2 year old plantation and -22 µmol m-2 s-1 in the 12 year old. The analysis of the cumulative fluxes show that the non-productive plantation was a carbon source of around 636 g CO2 m-2 during the 8 months of measurements, while in the productive period, it acted as a strong carbon sink (-794 g CO2 m-2 yr-1). Methane uptake was observed in the soil in both plantations and also for the whole ecosystem in the 12 year old one, but its contributions to the global greenhouse gas budget was very limited in relation to that of CO2. These results reveal the strong contrast between young non-productive and mature productive oil palm plantations, thus highlighting the need of evaluating all stages of development of oil palm plantations when assessing their carbon balance at regional scale.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for plant life, but too much P in runoff water can cause eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Hence, mitigation of agricultural P losses into the water cycle is a very important issue. In–stream P treatment is difficult to implement because the large amount of storm runoff needs to be treated in short durations. In this research, we evaluated the potential to use blind inlet as an in-field P treatment technology. A box system was built to simulate hydrological and chemical processes occurring in a blind inlet. Current blind inlets, which are already installed in the field, use a bed of limestone with a sand/pea gravel layer on the top. In this study, steel slags has been tested, which has a very high P sorption potential, as the filter media through a series of adsorption and desorption experiments. The P mass balance results are compared with the limestone material used in current blind inlet construction. The total mass of P which was absorbed by the limestone was 14 % of the P input into the system whereas 26 % P was absorbed by the steel slags. Therefore the steel slags show potential to sequester dissolved P. Additional research is on-going to come up with a design criteria for field implementation.",

Simulation results along the spacecraft track present signatures of high energetic O+ ions similar to MAVEN measurements. Comparison of simulated 3D distribution functions of this population are compared to STATIC and SWIA observations.

            "abstract": "There are many energetic electrons in the radiation belt of Earth. When the geomagnetic activity becomes stronger, the energy flux of energetic electrons will increase to more than ten times in the outer radiation belt, therefore it is very important to study how the energetic electrons generate and the lifetime of energetic electrons for space weather research. The acceleration of electrons in radiation belt is mainly depending on wave-particle interaction: the whistler mode chorus is the main driver for local acceleration mechanism, which could accelerate and loss energetic electrons; the geomagnetic pulsation ULF wave will cause energetic electron inward radial diffusion which will charge the electrons; recently observation results show us that the fast magnetosonic waves may also accelerate energetic electrons. For the reason that we try to study the wave-particle interaction between fast Magnetosonic and energetic electrons based on numerical simulation, in which the most important past is at the storm time the combination of highly warped Earth magnetic field and fast magnetosonic wave field will be applied for the electromagnetic environment of moving test particles. The energy, pitch angle and cross diffusion coefficients will be calculated respectively in this simulation to study how the electrons receive energy from fast magnetosonic wave. The diffusion coefficients within different dipole Earth magnetic field and non-dipole storm magnetic field are compared, while dynamics of electrons at selected initial energys are shown in our study.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon Basin during the wet season has one of the lowest aerosol concentrations worldwide, with air masses with negligible human impact covering thousands of kilometers of pristine forest. The natural environment is strongly modified near urbanized areas, in particular Manaus, a city of nearly two million people. This unique location provides the ideal laboratory to study isolated urban emissions as well the pristine environment by perturbing it in a relatively known fashion. The GoAmazon2014/5 experiment was designed with these questions in mind, combining remote sensing, in situ, and airborne measurements. This manuscript describes the measurements taken at the T0 site, upwind of Manaus, (the Amazonian Tall Tower Observatory, ATTO site), at the T2 site, near Manaus, frequently impacted by relatively fresh emissions from the city and at T3, 60 km downwind of Manaus. This work relates the aerosol dynamics of the mixture of anthropogenic emissions from Manaus and the biogenic air masses, and how it evolves from T2 to T3 under different atmospheric conditions. Focus is on the aerosol size distribution, supported by aerosol mass spectrometry and gas-phase composition, in particular at the T2 site.\nAt T0, the aerosol number concentration has been observed to increase from an average of 380 cm-3 to 1750 cm-3 from the wet to the dry season. The mean geometric diameter increased as well, from 95 nm to 145 nm. Interestingly, at the T2 site no significant difference was observed in number concentration between wet and dry seasons (approximately 4300 cm-3) with an average diameter of 60 nm during the former and 97 nm in the latter. Such measurements provide a unique dataset to understand the aerosol life cycle and the impact of urban emissions in the heart of the Amazon Forest.",

Enabling fractionation of water stable isotopes in the hydrological cycle of Earth System Models (ESMs) provides a theoretical framework for understanding the climate signal in paleoclimatic isotope records and testing hypothesis of climate change. Here we present a 1200-year long simulation driven by natural and anthropogenic forcings, making the simulation equivalent to the standard ESM simulations of the past millennium. We investigate the main climatic signals and processes that drive the composition of the modeled water stable isotopes in key regions of paleoclimate archives such as Greenland, South East Asia and Antarctica. This includes the influence of the major atmospheric circulation patterns at mid and high latitudes, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation, and the monsoon systems at the low latitudes.

            "abstract": "Coda wave interferometry is a technique which exploits tiny waveform changes in the coda to detect temporal variations of seismic properties in evolving media. Observed waveform changes are of two kinds: travel-time perturbations and distortion of seismograms. In the last ten years, various theories have been published to relate either background velocity changes to travel-time perturbations, or changes in the scattering properties of the medium to waveform decorrelation. These theories have been limited by assumptions pertaining to the scattering process itself -in particular isotropic scattering-, or to the propagation regime -single-scattering and/or diffusion-. In this work, we unify and extend previous results from the literature using a radiative transfer approach. This theory allows us to incorporate the effect of anisotropic scattering and to cover a broad range of propagation regimes, including the contribution of coherent, singly-scattered and multiply-scattered waves. Using basic physical reasoning, we show that two different sensitivity kernels are required to describe travel-time perturbations and waveform decorrelation, respectively, a distinction which has not been well appreciated so far. Previous results from the literature are recovered as limiting cases of our general approach. To illustrate the theory, we consider a series of scattering media displaying increasing levels of scattering anisotropy and discuss the impact on the travel-time and decorrelation kernels. The role of anisotropy is particularly pronounced for the decorrelation sensitivity kernel, which probes temporal changes in the scattering properties of the medium. Compared to the isotropic case, scattering anisotropy strongly increases the sensitivity of coda waves in the vicinity of the single-scattering ellipse, which may have important implications for imaging applications. This point is illustrated in the Figure where travel-time and decorrelation kernels are plotted for both isotropic and strongly anisotropic scattering. In addition to demonstrating the impact of non-isotropic scattering on the sensitivity kernels of coda waves, our work offers a practical solution to model this process accurately.",

Complete biotic recovery, characterized by a return to pre-extinction diversity levels, took an extraordinarily long time (ca. 5 x 106 yr), probably because harsh conditions developed repeatedly during the Early Triassic. Newly obtained organic geochemistry data from south China area, indicated a variety of biotic (eukaryotic algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria, and archaea) and environmental fluctuations (redox) during the Early Triassic. Remarkably, some sedimentary rocks from Lower Triassic strata contain rare biomarkers such as biphytanes and okenane, whch are biomarkers for archaea and purple sulfur bacteria, respectively. This is the first study to describe in detail primary producers, microbes, and redox conditions in the Early–Early Middle Triassic, on the basis of biomarkers such as steranes, 2-methyl hopanes, hopanes, biphytanes, regular isoprenoids, n-alkanes, okenane, chlorobactane, β-carotane, and γ-carotane. The results greatly not only increase our understanding of the recovery processes that occurred following the Permian mass extinction, but also emphasize an effectiveness of organic geochemistry against the Early Triassic.",

            "abstract": "Magnetite-apatite ore bodies of the Kiruna type occur worldwide and are generally associated with volcanic rocks or volcanism. They also show strong evidence of extensive metasomatism over a wide P-T range. Notable examples include the Kiirunavaara ore body, northern Sweden (Harlov et al., 2002, Chem. Geol., 191, 47–72); the Grängesberg ore body, central Sweden (Jonsson et al., 2010, NGF abstracts, vol 1, 88–89); the Mineville ore body, Adirondacks, New York, USA (McKeown and Klemc, 1956, U.S. Geol Sur Bull (1956), pp. 9–23); the Pea Ridge ore body, SE Missouri, USA (Kerr, 1998, MS Thesis, Univ. Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada 113 pp); the Jurassic Marcona ore body in south-central Peru (Chen et al., 2010, Econ Geol, 105, 1441–1456); and a collection of ore bodies from the Bafq Region, central Iran (Daliran et al., 2010, Geol. Assoc. Canada, Short Course Notes, v. 20, p.147–159).\nIn these ore bodies, low Th and U monazite, xenotime, allanite, REE carbonates, and/or REE fluorides are commonly associated with the apatite as inclusions, rim grains, or as independent grains in the surrounding mineral matrix. High contrast BSE imaging, coupled with EMPA and LA-ICPMS, indicates that the apatite has experienced fluid-induced alteration in the form of (Y+REE) + Na + Si + Cl depletion implying that it served as the source for the (Y+REE) (e.g. Kiirunavaara, northern Sweden; Harlov et al., 2002). Formation of monazite and xenotime associated with fluorapatite, as inclusions or rim grains, has experimentally been demonstrated to originate from the fluorapatite as the result of fluid-aided, coupled dissolution-reprecipitation processes (Harlov et al., 2005, Contrib. Mineral. Petrol. 150, 268–286). This is explains the low Th and U content of the monazite and xenotime. Fluid sources could range from 700–900 °C, residual, acidic (HCl, H2HSO4) grain boundary fluids, remaining after the last stages of ore body crystallization, to later stage, cooler (< 600 °C) (H2O-CO2-(Na,K)Cl) fluids originating in the surrounding country rock or as fluids associated with metamorphic events such as regional albitization or actinolization. The abundance of (Y+REE)-bearing minerals in these deposits suggests that in addition to being mined for their Fe ore, they could also be economically mined for (Y+REE) as well.",

            "abstract": "Although millennial-scale climate variability (<10 ka) has been well studied during the last glacial cycles, little is known about this important aspect of climate in the early Pleistocene, prior to the Middle Pleistocene Transition. Here we present a late early Pleistocene climate record at centennial resolution for two representative glaciations during the ‘41-ka world’ (Marine Isotope Stages MIS 37–41, from 1235 to 1320 ka) from IODP Site U1385 (“Shackleton Site”) on the southwest Iberian margin. Millennial-scale climate variability was suppressed during interglacial periods (MIS 37, MIS 39 and MIS 41) and was activated during glacial inceptions when benthic δ18O exceeded 3.2‰. Millennial variability during glacials MIS 38 and MIS 40 closely resembled Dansgaard-Oeschger events from the last glaciation (MIS 3) in amplitude, shape and pacing. The phasing of oxygen- and carbon-isotope variability is consistent with an active oceanic thermal bipolar see-saw between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Each of the prominent stadials in MIS 38 and MIS 40 was associated with a decrease in benthic carbon isotopes, indicating concomitant changes in meridional overturning circulation. A comparison to other North Atlantic records of ice-rafting in MIS 38 and MIS 40 suggests that freshwater forcing, as proposed for the late Pleistocene, triggered or amplified a slowdown of oceanic circulation and elicited the bipolar see-saw response. Our findings support similarities in the operation of the climate system occurring on millennial timescales both before and after the Middle Pleistocene Transition despite the increase in global ice volume and duration of the glacial cycles.",

            "abstract": "Reflection images represent the high-frequency end member of the suite of seismological tools commonly used to probe the lithosphere. The global inventory of deep reflection profiles has documented reflection characters as varied as the surface geology that provides the primary boundary condition for the interpretation of reflection images. Past reviews of reflection results have stressed similarities in reflection patterns between various geographic regions and attempted to associate these patterns with specific tectonic processes. Examples include: laminated sequences (shear fabrics formed during extension or collision), reflective Mohos (mafic underplating), bright spots (contemporary and fossil magma bodies), dipping mantle reflections rooted in the lower crust (fossil subduction zones) and subhorizontal mantle reflections (phase changes in the lower lithosphere). Here I focus on relating reflection character to the inversion and/or interpretation of results from broadband techniques such as receiver functions, body wave and surface wave tomography. Among the underappreciated aspects of reflectivity are its dependence upon density as well as velocity, and the limitations of 2D images in a 3D world. A core consideration is the need to meaningfully relate integrated physical properties (e.g. velocity inferred from refraction and surface wave measurements) with the differential physical properties (e.g. reflection coefficients) to which reflection images are primarily sensitive. Examples from Tibet and Eurasia are used to illustrate examples of successful integration of controlled (active) and natural (passive) source observations to constrain models of crustal evolution.",

            "abstract": "Compressed air energy storage (CAES) in porous formations has been considered as one promising option of large scale energy storage for decades. This study, hereby, aims at analyzing the feasibility of operating large scale CAES in porous formations and evaluating the performance of underground porous gas reservoirs. To address these issues quantitatively, a hypothetic CAES scenario with a typical anticline structure in northern Germany was numerically simulated. Because of the rapid growth in photovoltaics, the period of extraction in a daily cycle was set to the early morning and the late afternoon in order to bypass the massive solar energy production around noon. The gas turbine scenario was defined referring to the specifications of the Huntorf CAES power plant. The numerical simulations involved two stages, i.e. initial fill and cyclic operation, and both were carried out using the Eclipse E300 simulator (Schlumberger). Pressure loss in the gas wells was post analyzed using an analytical solution. The exergy concept was applied to evaluate the potential energy amount stored in the specific porous formation. The simulation results show that porous formations prove to be a feasible solution of large scale CAES. The initial fill with shut-in periods determines the spatial distribution of the gas phase and helps to achieve higher gas saturation around the wells, and thus higher deliverability. The performance evaluation shows that the overall exergy flow of stored compressed air is also determined by the permeability, which directly affects the deliverability of the gas reservoir and thus the number of wells required.",

            "abstract": "Cold seep carbonates along the Norwegian margin, insights into U-Th geochronology and S geochemistry\nAuthigenic carbonate crusts form in shallow subsurface of marine sediments due to the microbial anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). As a result they are unique archives of the locus and intensity of past methane seepage that can be dated by using U-daughter decay affording the unique opportunity to constrain the absolute timing of methane release events. Because AOM is mainly driven by the microbial reduction of seawater sulfate, multiple sulfur isotope compositions of paired carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and pyrite in seep carbonates taken as proxies for porewater sulfate and sulfide, respectively, have the potential to reconstruct the biogeochemical conditions under which seep carbonates precipitate. Methane-derived carbonate crusts were collected from several seepage sites on the Norwegian continental shelf, including sites in the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea.\nThe U-Th dating results constrain the main episode of carbonate crust formation in the Barents and Norwegian seas during the time interval between 14 and 7 ka. Such ages suggest that the methane seepage along the northern Norwegian margin was most active after the collapse of the Scandinavian ice sheet and deglaciation of the area that took place at about 15 ka. The methane flux for the carbonate crust formation was likely provided by the dissociation of methane hydrates that extensively formed in underlying sediments during the last glacial period, but became unstable due to depressuring effects of retreating ice sheet. The precipitation of studied North Sea carbonate crusts occurred more recently, from 6 to 1 ka, suggesting that their formation is unrelated to the glacial history of the area. The paired sulfur stable isotope compositions of pyrite-CAS record a large range of fractionation factors (from 30 to 70 ‰) reflecting change of sulfate-reduction rates possibly controlled by variable methane concentrations during carbonate precipitation.",

Water isotopes have been used to trace atmospheric moisture source, identify source of groundwater and surface water charge, reconstruct paleoclimate, and so on. Tap water appears to reflect pervasive features of regional integrated hydrological process. China is a large-size country with high variations in both environmental and geographical factors including temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, latitude, altitude et al. Here we present a first national-scale survey on stable isotope of tap water across China. More than 1000 tap water samples have been collected from 93 cities across China by monthly between December 2014 and November 2015. Stable isotope composition of tap water ranged from -132.1‰ to -25.6‰ (δ2H) and from -17.5‰ to -4.2‰ (δ18O). The Meteoric Water Line is δ2H = 7.77 δ18O + 5.79 (r2 = 0.95) and the LMWL of Chinese precipitation is δ2H =7.6δ18O+ 9.94 (r2= 0.97). Spatial distribution of stable isotopes present typical “continental effect”, isotope values generally decrease from coastal regions to inland. Isotopes in different regions present different correlations with temperature, precipitation amount, latitude and altitude as a result of varied moisture source and local water supply. The results of the study could provide mapping information of tap water for fundamental isotope hydrological studies in different regions of China.",

            "abstract": "Climate variability greatly alters the hydrologic regime but its impact analysis is hampered by disparity in the resolutions of GCMs & meteorological forcings required for catchment-scale simulation as the GCM outputs are too coarse to capture the local climate. Hence, dynamic downscaling was employed to represent the regional heterogeneity. Daily climatic data from HadCM3 at 2.5°x3.75° was downscaled to generate 3-hourly outputs at 0.25° for the Ganges basin using Advanced WRF model. Domain specific geographic data (SRTM 30m DEM, NRSC LU/LC & NBSSLUP soil) for the Indian region was ingested into the model, along with the global landuse & terrestrial data (GTOPO 1km DEM, USGS LU/LC etc.) for other regions, to aid regional meteorological prediction. Appropriate physics options were applied to mimic the interactions between atmosphere & land surface processes. The resultant downscaled precipitation & temperature products were calibrated & bias corrected using NCEP Reanalysis data & IMD gridded dataset. The model was able to reconstruct the orographic rainfall & extreme precipitation events that occurred in different years over Leh, Rudraprayag, Uttarkashi, Manali, Kedarnath, etc. The model was also compiled with varying spatial, temporal & hardware configurations to optimize the computational cost. A physically based semi distributed VIC model was forced using the downscaled product, & calibrated-validated using observed flow data to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrologic responses of the basin. The results suggested an early onset of monsoon with heavy rainfall in the early months of monsoon. While the number of rainy days in monsoon season decreased, intensity of rainfall increased. Subsequently, the runoff intensity increased with an overall decrease in total runoff in the future scenario. This study demonstrated the efficacy of dynamic downscaling & hydrologic models for climate change studies.",

            "abstract": "Soil fungi fill many essential ecological and biogeochemical roles, e.g. decomposing litter, redistributing nutrients, and promoting biodiversity. Fairy ring fungi offer a rare glimpse into the otherwise opaque spatiotemporal dynamics of soil fungal growth, because subsurface mycelial patterns can be inferred from observations at the soil’s surface. These observations can be made directly when the fungi send up fruiting bodies (e.g., mushrooms and toadstools), or indirectly via the effect the fungi have on neighboring organisms. Grasses in particular often temporarily thrive on the nutrients liberated by the fungus, creating bands of rich, dark green turf at the edge of the fungal mat. To date, only annular (the “ring” in fairy ring) and arc patterns have been described in the literature.\nWe report observations of novel spiral and rotor pattern formation in fairy ring fungi, as seen in publically available high-resolution aerial imagery of 22 sites across the continental United States. To explain these new behaviors, we first demonstrate that a well-known model describing fairy ring formation is equivalent to the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model, which is known to support a wide range of dynamical behaviors, including annular traveling waves, rotors, spirals, and stable spatial patterns including spots and stripes. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation are then used to define the region of parameter space that supports spiral and rotor formation. We find that this region is adjacent to one within which typical fairy rings develop.\nModel results suggest simple experimental procedures that could potentially induce traditional ring structures to exhibit rotor or spiral dynamics. Intriguingly, the Gray-Scott model predicts that these same procedures could be used to solicit even richer patterns, including spots and stripes, which have not yet been identified in the field.",

            "abstract": "Grounding-zone wedges (GZW) have been mapped on the sea floor in various sectors of the formerly glaciated continental shelf around Antarctica. In most cases, these wedges record periods of grounding-line stillstands during ice-sheet retreat following the Last Glacial Maximum (~26-19 ka BP; kiloyears before present). The presence of GZWs along the axis of a palaeo-ice stream trough therefore indicates a style of episodic retreat of the grounding line from its LGM to modern position. However, precise chronological constraints for both the onset and duration of these stillstands are still lacking. Consequently, the role of grounding-zone wedge formation in modulating post-LGM ice-sheet retreat cannot be reliably quantified. This information is vital, however, for calculating reliable retreat rates during the past, which are essential for evaluating and understanding the significance of modern retreat rates. Here we present the currently known inventory of GZWs on the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica. The glaciers draining into this embayment are retreating at exceptionally high rates compared to the ice sheet as a whole. We will discuss geological preconditions at the ice sheet bed that led to GZW formation, and draw possible relations between GZWs in two neighbouring outer shelf palaeo-ice stream troughs that are separated by an inter-ice stream ridge. Furthermore, we will present our approach how to i) reliably date the onset of stabilization periods, and ii) constrain the actual duration of stillstands. This knowledge will help refine available post-LGM retreat chronologies, which, in turn, serve as a basis for validating and improving ice-sheet models in an area where these are urgently needed.",

While the Eastern NCC has experienced significant thinning and modification in mantle since the early Mesozoic, the TNCO exhibits both thick and dramatically thinned lithosphere. In order to investigate the inhomogeneous lithospheric thinning of northern TNCO, the electrical conductivity structure from the crust to uppermost mantle was derived by the 3D magnetotelluric(MT) inversion technique from data of 75 Broadband magneotelluric (BBMT)stations. Our inversion result shows that the relatively stable Yanshan Uplift is characterized by a simply 1-D layer structure about 10000 Ωm in the upper and middle crust and 1000 Ωm in the mantle, which could be illustrated as the intact cold Archean lithosphere with very high resistivity, whereas prominent high-conductivity anomalies of 10 Ωm extensively exist beneath the Datong-Yanggao Basin, the Weixian-Yangyuan Basin and Datong volcanic zone. While petromagnetic studies shows that bi-level magnetic lower crust are preserved beneath northern TNCO, which was the result of the continuous underplating of basaltic magmas from the late Paleozoic to the Cenozoic, We also assume that the conductive middle and lower crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Shanxi rift is related to the addition of juvenile materials form mantle to lower crust, with a mixing of the old crust with melts. Nowadays the heat flow of our study area is 50 mW/m2 on average, which is difficult to support the presence of partial melting, but the interconnected iron oxides and iron sulfides were preserved as a signature of the high Cenozoic heat flow as well as lithospheric thinning.",

In the meanwhile, distinct proton ring distributions with peaks at energies of ∼10 keV, were also observed in L = 3.2–4.6 and L = 5.0–5.6. Using a subtracted bi-Maxwellian distribution to model the observed proton ring distribution, we perform three-dimensional ray tracing to investigate the instability, propagation, and spatial distribution of MS waves. Numerical results show that nightside MS waves are produced by proton ring distribution and grow rapidly from the source location L = 5.6 to the location L = 5.0 but remain nearly stable at locations L < 5.0. Moreover, waves launched toward lower L shells with different initial azimuthal angles propagate across different MLT regions with divergent paths at first, then gradually turn back toward higher L shells and propagate across different MLT regions with convergent paths. The current results further reveal that MS waves are generated by a ring distribution of ∼10 keV proton and proton ring in one region can contribute to the MS wave power in another region.",

            "abstract": "Since the first-light images from the Suomi-NPP VIIRS low-light visible Day/Night Band (DNB) sensor were received in November 2011, the NASA Suomi-NPP Land Science Investigator Processing System (SIPS) has focused on evaluating this new capability for quantitative science applications, as well as developing and testing refined algorithms to meet operational and Land science research needs. While many promising DNB applications have been developed since the Suomi-NPP launch, most studies to-date have been limited by the traditional qualitative image display and spatial-temporal aggregated statistical analysis methods inherent in current heritage algorithms. This has resulted in strong interest for a new generation of science-quality products that can be used to monitor both the magnitude and signature of nighttime phenomena and anthropogenic sources of light emissions. In one particular case study, Román and Stokes (2015) demonstrated that tracking daily dynamic DNB radiances can provide valuable information about the character of the human activities and behaviors that influence energy, consumption, and vulnerability. Here we develop and evaluate a new suite of DNB science-quality algorithms that can exclude a primary source of background noise: i.e., the Lunar BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) effect. Every day, the operational NASA Land SIPS DNB algorithm makes use of 16 days worth of DNB-derived surface reflectances (SR) (based on the heritage MODIS SR algorithm) and a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model to determine a global set of parameters describing the BRDF of the land surface. The nighttime period of interest is heavily weighted as a function of observation coverage. These gridded parameters, combined with Miller and Turner’s [2009] top-of-atmosphere spectral irradiance model, are then used to determine the DNB’s lunar radiance contribution at any point in time and under specific illumination conditions.",

            "abstract": "Modern graduate education must extend beyond disciplinary content to prepare students for diverse careers in science. At Dartmouth, a graduate program in Polar Environmental Change uses interdisciplinary study of the polar regions as a core from which students develop skills and knowledge for tackling complex environmental issues that require cooperation across scientific disciplines and with educators, policy makers, and stakeholders. Two major NSF-funded initiatives have supported professional development for graduate students in this program, including an IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship) and leadership of JSEP’s (Joint Science Education Project) Arctic Science Education Week in Greenland. We teach courses that emphasize the links between science and the human dimensions of environmental change; host training sessions in science communication; invite guest speakers who work in policy, academia, journalism, government research, etc.; lead an international field-based training that includes policy-focused meetings and a large outreach component; provide multiple opportunities for outreach and collaboration with local schools; and build outreach and education into graduate research programs where students instruct and mentor high school students. Students from diverse scientific disciplines (Ecology, Earth Science, and Engineering) participate in all of the above, which significantly strengthens their interdisciplinary view of polar science and ability to communicate across disciplines. In addition, graduate students have developed awareness, confidence, and the skills to pursue and obtain diverse careers. This is reflected in the fact that recent graduates have acquired permanent and post-doctoral positions in academic and government research, full-time teaching, and also in post-docs focused on outreach and science policy. Dartmouth’s interdisciplinary approach to graduate education is producing tomorrow’s leaders in science.",

We study the effect of temperature on the evolution of pore space and subsequent permeability on five oil shale samples: (1) Vernal Utah United States, (2) El Lajjun Al Karak Jordan, (3) Gladstone Queensland Australia (4) Fushun China and (5) Kimmerdige United Kingdom. Oil Shale cores of 5mm in diameter were pyrolized at 300, 400 and 500 °C. 3D imaging of 5mm diameter core samples was performed at 1µm voxel resolution using X-ray micro computed tomography (CT) and the evolution of the pore structures were characterized. The experimental results indicate that the thermal decomposition of kerogen at high temperatures is a major factor causing micro-scale changes in the internal structure of oil shales. At the early stage of pyrolysis, micron-scale heterogeneous pores were formed and with a further increase in temperature, the pores expanded and became interconnected by fractures. Permeability for each oil shale sample at each temperature was computed by simulation directly on the image voxels and by pore network extraction and simulation. Future work will investigate different samples and pursue insitu micro-CT imaging of oil shale pyrolysis to characterize the time evolution of the pore space.",

            "abstract": "We implement fully-coupled high resolution 3D thermo-mechanical numerical models to investigate the impact of the laterally heterogeneous structure and rheological stratification of the continental lithosphere on the plume-activated rifting and continental break-up processes in presence of preexisting far-ﬁeld tectonic stresses. In our experiments, “mantle plumes” represent short-lived diapiric upwellings that have no continuous feeding at depth. Such upwellings may be associated with “true” plumes but also with various instabilities in the convective mantle. Numerical models demonstrate strong dependence of crustal strain distributions and surface topography on the rheological composition of the lower crust and the initial thermal structure of the lithosphere. In contrast to the usual inferences from passive rifting models, distributed wide rifting takes place in case of cold (500 °C at Moho depth) initial isotherm and mafic composition of the lower crust, whereas hotter geotherms and weaker (wet quartzite) lower crustal rheology lead to strong localization of rifting. Moreover, it appears that the prerequisite of strongly anisotropic strain localization during plume-lithosphere interaction (linear rift structures instead of axisymmetric radial faulting) refers to simultaneous presence of a mantle upwelling and of (even extremely weak) directional stress field produced by far-ﬁeld tectonic forces (i.e. ultra-slow far field extension at < 3 mm/y). Higher (than 1.5-3 mm/y) velocities of far-field extension lead to enlargement of the active fault zone for the same lapse of time. Yet, simultaneous rise of the lithospheric geotherm associated with active rifting has an opposite effect leading to the narrowing of the rift zone. Presence of heterogeneities (cratonic blocks) leads to splitting of the plume head onto initially nearly symmetrical parts, each of which flows towards beneath the craton borders. This craton-controlled distribution of plume material causes the crustal strain localization and uprise of plume material along the craton boundaries. Though there is a net tendency of more rapid transition to spreading in case of more intensive far-field forcing, the presence of «cratonic» blocks seemingly leads to acceleration of break-up processes.",

            "abstract": "Supraglacial lake drainage events are common on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Observations on the west coast of Greenland show that lakes at higher elevations typically drain later than those at lower elevations. We observe a system at Helheim Glacier where, for the majority of years between 2007 and 2014, the reverse is true. Here, a lake drainage event precedes the consecutive filling and draining of multiple areas of crevasses at lower elevations by between ten and thirty days. Furthermore, the presence of a proglacial plume typically coincides with increased water levels in the lower crevasses.\nCombining a linear elastic fracture mechanics model with existing models of surface melt production, we show that hydrofracture driven by surface melt occurs much earlier in the year than the observed peaks in water volume. From this we conclude that, following the initial hydrofracture, the crevasses remain hydraulically connected to the bed for a large portion of the summer. The observed water level fluctuations in the crevasses can therefore be explained by a transient high pressure event passing through the subglacial system following the lake drainage.\nThese observations have wide ranging implications for our understanding of the dynamics of tidewater glaciers. For calving, full depth fractures may exist in the ice many kilometres from the terminus providing initiation points for subsequent calving events. This suggests a more nuanced role for hydrofracture in the calving process than previously theorised. For subglacial hydrology, these transient events can have major impacts on the subglacial system. Additionally, these water filled crevasses should provide a useful proxy for basal water pressures in areas which are notoriously difficult to access. We expect that these results are not specific to Helheim Glacier or the south east region of Greenland, and will have important implications for tidewater glaciers globally.",

            "abstract": "One of the foremost challenges to monitoring the climate system is the ability to make a precise measurement of Earth’s radiation budget components from space. Thereupon a new “Meteor-M” satellite program has been started in Russia. The first satellite of new generation “Meteor-M” № 1 was put into orbit in September, 2009 and second satellite “Meteor-M” № 2 - in July, 2014. Some measurements results obtained by the nadir looking medium field of view radiometers IKOR-M which was installed on “Meteor-M” satellites are presented. These equipments were created in Saratov State University under the direction of Yu. A. Sklyarov for monitoring of outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR), albedo and absorbed solar radiation (ASR) at TOA. The basic products of data processing are given in the form of global maps of distribution OSR, albedo and ASR. Such maps were made for each month during observation period. Fig. 1 presents the map of global distribution of monthly averaged values of albedo in April, 2014.\nTwo series of measurements from two different IKOR-M are available. The first radiometer had worked from October, 2009 to August, 2014 and second - from August, 2014 to the present. Therefore, there is a period when both radiometers work at the same time. TOA fluxes deduced from the “Meteor-M” № 1 measurements in August, 2014 show very good agreement with the fluxes determined from “Meteor-M” № 2.\nThe seasonal and interannual variations of OSR, albedo and ASR were discussed. The variations between SW radiation budget components seem to be within observational uncertainty and natural variability governed by cloudiness, water vapor and aerosol variations.\nIt was assessed spatial and temporal variations of albedo and ASR over different regions. Latitudinal distributions of albedo and ASR were estimated in more detail. Meridional cross sections over oceans and land were used separately for this estimation. It was shown that the albedo and ASR data received from the radiometer IKOR-M can be used to detect El-Nino in the Pacific Ocean and monitoring of the East Asian Summer Monsoon.\nOther details of received data will are presented.\nThe work was carried out under financial support of the Ministry of education and science of the Russian Federation within the framework of the base part (project code 2179).",

Over the planned 10-year span, the project will conduct simulations and modeling on DOE’s most powerful high-performance computing systems at Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Lawrence Berkeley Leadership Compute Facilities.\nA key component of the ACME project is the development of an interactive test bed for the advanced Earth system model. Its execution infrastructure will accelerate model development and testing cycles. The ACME Workflow Group is leading the efforts to automate labor-intensive tasks, provide intelligent support for complex tasks and reduce duplication of effort through collaboration support.\nAs part of this new workflow environment, we have created a diagnostic, metric, and intercomparison Python framework, called UVCMetrics, to aid in the testing-to-production execution of the ACME model. The framework exploits similarities among different diagnostics to compactly support diagnosis of new models. It presently focuses on atmosphere and land but is designed to support ocean and sea ice model components as well.\nThis framework is built on top of the existing open-source software framework known as the Ultrascale Visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT). Because of its flexible framework design, scientists and modelers now can generate thousands of possible diagnostic outputs. These diagnostics can compare model runs, compare model vs. observation, or simply verify a model is physically realistic. Additional diagnostics are easily integrated into the framework, and our users have already added several. Diagnostics can be generated, viewed, and manipulated from the UV-CDAT graphical user interface, Python command line scripts and programs, and web browsers.\nThe framework is designed to be scalable to large datasets, yet easy to use and familiar to scientists using previous tools. Integration in the ACME overall user interface facilitates data publication, further analysis, and quick feedback to model developers and scientists making component or coupled model runs.",

            "abstract": "Long-term surface measurements in several locations extending from northeastern coast of South America to Miami in Florida have shown that African dust arrives in the Greater Caribbean Basin throughout a year. This long-range transported dust frequently elevates the level of particulate matter (PM) above the WHO guideline for PM10, which raises a concern of possible adverse impact of African dust on human health in the region. There is also concern about how future climate change might affect dust transport and its influence on regional air quality. In this presentation we provide a comprehensive characterization of the influence of African dust on air quality in the Caribbean Basin via integrating the ground observations with satellite retrievals and model simulations. The ground observations are used to validate and evaluate satellite retrievals and model simulations of dust, while satellite measurements and model simulations are used to extend spatial coverage of the ground observations. An analysis of CALIPSO lidar measurements of three-dimensional distribution of aerosols over 2007-2014 yields altitude-resolved dust mass flux into the region. On a basis of 8-year average and integration over the latitude zone of 0°-30°N, a total of 76 Tg dust is imported to the air above the Greater Caribbean Basin, of which 34 Tg (or 45%) is within the lowest 1 km layer and most relevant to air quality concern. The seasonal and interannual variations of the dust import are well correlated with ground observations of dust in Cayenne, Barbados, Puerto Rico, and Miami. We will also show comparisons of the size-resolved dust amount from both NASA GEOS-5 aerosol simulation and MERRA-2 aerosol reanalysis (i.e., column aerosol loading being constrained by satellite measurements of radiance at the top of atmosphere) with the ground observations and satellite measurement.",

It is therefore desirable to have a common merged data product that combines the best parts of both instruments. Extensive ground based test measurements have been performed to identify the properties of the instruments. New models for compensating time and frequency properties were created and the difference to existing calibrations is analyzed. Considerations for application as well as signal processing constraints are discussed and the resulting method is applied on data from the mission. Dipolarization events can serve as suitable example, since they contain a variety of disturbances with different characteristic scales: transient filamentary properties, sharp fronts, reconfiguration of the current sheet, wave signatures on kinetic as well as fluid scales, thus requiring highest sensitivity data in a wide frequency range.

            "abstract": "Although some observational evidences have suggested the occurrence of convection in the lower part of Venus' cloud layer, its structure remains to be clarified. To date, a few numerical studies have examined the structure of convective motion (Baker et al., 1998, 2000; Imamura et al., 2014), but the model they utilized is two-dimensional. Here we report on the results of our numerical calculations performed in order to investigate possible three-dimensional structure of the convection.\nWe use a convection resolving model developed by Sugiyama et al. (2009), which is used in the simulations of the atmospheric convection of Jupiter (Sugiyama et al., 2011,2014) and Mars (Yamashita et al., submitted). We perform two experiments. The first one, which we call Ext.B, is based on Baker et al. (1998). A constant turbulent mixing coefficient is used in the whole domain, and a constant thermal flux is given at the upper and lower boundaries as a substitute for infrared heating. The second one, which we call Exp.I, is based on Imamura et al. (2014). The sub-grid turbulence process is implemented by Klemp and Wilhelmson (1989), and an infrared heating profile obtained in a radiative-convective equilibrium calculation (Ikeda, 2011) is used. In both experiments, the averaged solar heating profile is used. The spatial resolution is 200 m in the horizontal direction and 125 m in the vertical direction. The domain covers 128km x 128km horizontally and altitudes from 40 km to 60 km.\nObtained structures of convection moderately differ in the two experiments. Although the depth of convection layer is almost the same, the horizontal cell size of Exp.B is larger than that of Exp.I; the cell sizes in Exp.B and Exp.I are about 40 km and 25 km, respectively. The vertical motion in Exp.B is asymmetric; updrafts are widespread and weak (~3m/s), whereas downdrafts are narrow and strong (~10m/s). On the other hand, the vertical motion in Exp.I is nearly symmetric and weaker (~2m/s) compared with those in Exp.B. The difference of convective structure results from the different vertical distributions of implemented infrared heating. Namely, the intense downdrafts in Exp.B are forced by the strong cooling concentrated near the top of convection layer. In Exp.I, the heating is distributed in a thick layer, so that relatively symmetric vertical motion occurs.",

            "abstract": "Although they are a very common bedforms in terrestrial sand seas, description of linear dune growth, either by extension or lateral migration is still hindered by our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, sand flux estimates in arid regions relies essentially on the migration speed of barchan dunes but not on the dynamics of linear dunes despite their abundance. Here we use half a century of high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery of the Ténéré desert, the world’s largest source of mineral aerosols, to demonstrate that linear dunes can elongate in the direction of the resultant sand flux with no lateral migration. As they form away from topographic obstacles in a zone of low sediment availability experiencing multimodal winds, these elongating structures are ideal to isolate and quantify dune growth by pure extension. Using similar conditions in a numerical model, we show how deposition downstream of low hills may result in nucleation and development of bedforms. From pure elongation, we derive the local sand flux parallel to the linear dune crests. Together with sand flux estimates perpendicular to the barchan dune crests, this study indicates that two independent dune growth mechanisms can now be used for reconstructing sediment transport and wind conditions from dune morphodynamics.",

            "abstract": "Power law models of the form y = -axb are used to represent a wide range of phenomena in the physical, biological and social sciences. Power laws are well known to display a “scale-free property”, meaning that the value of the exponent b is independent of the unit of measurement (the “scale”) of the state variable x. While this makes estimation of the exponent robust, it raises significant estimation challenges for the linear multiplier a. Specifically, if both the multiplier a and exponent b are allowed to vary when undertaking an empirical fitting procedure, then physical units used to measure x induce a formal (i.e., entirely nonphysical) dependence between a and b, because the fitted value of a will contain a (potentially large) multiplicative factor that varies depending on the scale of x. This is problematic for two reasons: (i) if a is to be empirically estimated, but admits a physical interpretation, then the scale-dependent factor can confound the physically meaningful value (ii) the formal relationship between a and b due to the scaling of the relationship obscures any true relationship between the parameters and could motivate a spurious interpretation of their co-variation.\nTo correct this issue, we present a technique to remove the formal correlation between a and b, and demonstrate an application of the technique in the context of streamflow recession analysis, where the falling limb of the hydrograph is modeled using a simple power law relationship, dq/dt = -aqb. Following the decorrelation of (a, b) recession parameter pairs, physically intuitive seasonal patterns, greatly obscured in the original data, are clearly found.",

            "abstract": "Mantle strain localization is of great importance for lithosphere dynamics, but the cause for this phenomenon still remains very elusive, particularly in conditions of the strong and ductile uppermost mantle. Based on Griggs-type experiments, we show here that strain localization arises from solution transfer at olivine-pyroxene interfaces while olivine deforms by low-temperature creep. Deforming olivine (70%) plus diopside (30%) aggregates at 900°C and 1.2 GPa in presence of water, these experiments produce typical ductile shear zones which develop during substantial drop of the sample strength. At these conditions, olivine deforms through low-temperature plasticity and weakens, partly due to dynamic recrystallization driven by grain boundary migration. However, although substantial, this weakening alone does not promote strain localization, which only occurs if secondary phases are present. Indeed, the presence of clinopyroxene (CPx) leads to the formation of a fine-grained olivine-CPx mixture (~0.1 micron grain size) that extends in thin layers from the tips of CPx. Because of phase mixing and grain growth inhibition that stabilize the extremely small grain size, these layers deform through grain-size-sensitive creep, promoting further weakening of the sample. Together with strain-induced olivine weakening, this mixture-related weakening acts as a critical process for strain to localize. Furthermore, the presence of mixture with fluid inclusions in cracks of CPx indicate that new olivine and CPx crystallize from a fluid phase, in favor of chemically driven solution transfer at CPx boundaries. Our findings thus emphasize solution transfer as a start-up process for strain localization, provided that olivine aggregates weaken during plastic flow, as documented for low-temperature creep.",

            "abstract": "Lightning strokes induces lower ionospheric nighttime disturbances which can be detected through Very Low Frequency (VLF) remote sensing via at least two means: (1) direct heating and ionization, known as an Early event, and (2) triggered precipitation of energetic electrons from the radiation belts, known as Lightning-induced Electron Precipitation (LEP). For each, the ionospheric recover time is typically a few minutes or less. A small class of Early events have been identified as having unusually long ionospheric recoveries (10s of minutes), with the underlying mechanism still in question. Our study shows for the first time that some LEP events also demonstrate unusually long recovery. The VLF events were detected by visual inspection of the recorded data in both the North-South and East-West magnetic fields. Data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) are used to determine the location and peak current of the lightning responsible for each lightning-associated VLF perturbation. LEP or Early VLF events are determined by measuring the time delay between the causative lightning discharges and the onset of all lightning-associated perturbations. LEP events typically possess an onset delay greater than ~ 200 msec following the causative lightning discharges, while the onset of Early VLF events is time-aligned (<20 msec) with the lightning return stroke. Nonducted LEP events are distinguished from ducted events based on the location of the causative lightning relative to the precipitation region. From 15 March to 20 April and 15 October to 15 November 2011, a total of 385 LEP events observed at Indiana, Montana, Colorado and Oklahoma VLF sites, on the NAA, NLK and NML transmitter signals. 46 of these events exhibited a long recovery. It has been found that the occurrence rate of ducted long recovery LEP events is higher than nonducted. Of the 46 long recovery LEP events, 33 events were induced by ducted whistlers, and 13 events were associated with nonducted obliquely propagating whistler waves. The occurrence of high peak current lightning strokes is a prerequisite for long recovery LEP events.",

            "abstract": "Surface water quality in the Amsterdam area is suffering from high nutrient levels. The sources and transport mechanisms of these nutrients are unclear due to the complex hydrology of the highly manipulated urban and sub-urban polder catchments. This study aimed at identifying the impact of groundwater on surface water quality in the polder catchments of the greater Amsterdam city area. Therefore, we exploited the dense groundwater and surface water monitoring networks to explain spatial patterns in surface water chemistry and their relations with landscape characteristics and groundwater impact. We selected and statistically analyzed 23 variables for 144 polders, covering a total area of 700 km2. Our dataset includes concentrations of total-N, total-P, ammonium, nitrate, bicarbonate, sulfate, calcium, and chloride in surface water and groundwater, seepage rate, elevation, paved area percentage, surface water area percentage, and soil type (calcite, humus and clay percentages). Our results show that nutrient levels in groundwater were generally much higher than in surface water and often exceeded the surface water Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs). This indicates that groundwater is a large potential source of nutrients in surface water. High correlations (R2 up to 0.88) between solutes in both water compartments and close similarities in their spatial patterns confirmed the large impact of groundwater on surface water quality. Groundwater appeared to be a major source of chloride, bicarbonate and calcium in surface water and for N and P, leading to exceeding of EQSs in surface waters. In dry periods, the artificial redistribution of excess seepage water from deep polders to supply water to infiltrating polders further distributes the N and P loads delivered by groundwater over the area.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation, and the application of nitrogen fertilizers provide subsidies to land ecosystems that can increase nitrogen availability for vegetation production and thereby influence land carbon dynamics. In addition, enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) from warming soils and permafrost degradation may also increase nitrogen availability in Northern Eurasia. Here, we examine how changes in nitrogen availability may influence land carbon dynamics in Northern Eurasia during the 21st century by comparing results for a “business as usual” scenario (the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways or RCP 8.5) and a stabilization scenario (RCP 4.5) between a version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model that does not consider the effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation and soil thermal dynamics on land carbon dynamics (TEM 4.4) and a version that does consider these dynamics (TEM 6.0). In these simulations, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation, and fertilizer applications provide an additional 3.3 Pg N (RCP 4.5) to 3.9 Pg N (RCP 8.5) to Northern Eurasian ecosystems over the 21st century. Land ecosystems retain about 38% (RCP4.5) to 48% (RCP 8.5) of this nitrogen subsidy. Net nitrogen mineralization estimated by TEM 6.0 provide an additional 1.0 Pg N to vegetation than estimated by TEM 4.4 over the 21st century from enhanced decomposition of SOM including SOM formerly protected by permafrost. The enhanced nitrogen availability in TEM 6.0 allows Northern Eurasian ecosystems to sequester 1.8x (RCP 8.5) to 2.4x (RCP 4.5) more carbon over the 21st century than estimated by TEM 4.4. Our results indicate that consideration of nitrogen subsidies and soil thermal dynamics have a large influence on how simulated land carbon dynamics in Northern Eurasia will respond to future changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and disturbances.",

            "abstract": "A primary motivation for investigating volcanic systems is developing the ability to predict eruptions and mitigate disaster for vulnerable populations. To take the next step towards the goal of forecasting eruptions, robust model-data fusion techniques must be developed to tackle the problem of combining multiple, disparate volcano monitoring datasets with increasingly sophisticated numerical models. In this investigation, we present a sequential data assimilation framework to combine multiple datasets with dynamic models using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The goal of this investigation is to test the EnKF as a potential sequential data assimilation technique for forecasting volcanic unrest. In this initial study, we adapt the EnKF to assimilate GPS and InSAR data into time-forward, viscoelastic, finite element models of an evolving magma system. The numerical tests of the EnKF provide two critical results: (1) a proof of concept for using the EnKF to assimilate multiple datasets for investigating volcanic activity; and (2) the comparison of spatially limited, but temporally dense, GPS data to temporally limited InSAR observations for evaluating magma chamber dynamics during periods of volcanic unrest. Results indicate that the temporally dense information provided by three-component GPS observations results in faster convergence and more accurate model predictions than single-component line of sight (LOS) deformation from InSAR. However, most importantly, the EnKF is able to swiftly respond to data updates by changing the model forecast trajectory to match incoming observations. This initial study demonstrates a great potential for utilizing the EnKF for multiple dataset assimilation to assess volcanic unrest and provide model forecasts of active systems. The development of these new techniques provides: (1) a framework for future applications of rapid data assimilation and model development during volcanic crises; (2) a method for hind-casting to investigate previous volcanic eruptions; and (3) a method for optimizing survey designs for future data collection campaigns at active volcanic systems.",

            "abstract": "Lagged correlation analysis of Arctic sea ice area anomalies reveals that melt season sea ice anomalies tend to recur the following growth season, and growth season anomalies tend to recur the following melt season. In this work, the regional and temporal characteristics of this phenomenon, termed sea-ice reemergence, are investigated in a hierarchy of climate models. Coupled nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA), a multivariate data analysis technique, is used to study the covariability of Arctic sea-ice concentration (SIC), sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-level pressure (SLP), and sea-ice thickness (SIT). Two mechanisms related to melt season to growth season reemergence are identified: (1) An SST-SIC mechanism, related to local imprinting and persistence of SST anomalies in the seasonal ice zones, and (2) an SLP-SIC mechanism, related to winter-to-winter regime persistence of large-scale SLP teleconnection patterns. An SIT-SIC growth season to melt season reemergence mechanism is also identified, related to winter persistence of SIT anomalies in the central Arctic. The representation of these mechanisms is investigated using the model hierarchy to determine the relative roles of the ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice itself in producing reemergence. It is found that the SST-based and SIT-based mechanisms can exist as stand-alone processes, whereas the SLP mechanism cannot. Dynamical feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere is found to be essential in creating large-scale organized patterns of SIC-SLP covariability. A set of reemergence metrics is introduced, by which one can judge the amplitude and phase of reemergence events and associated mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The lithospheric structure and thickness to the LAB are the most debated issues, especially beneath continents. In this context, the structure and thickness of the Indian lithosphere has been controversial. Paleomagnetic data reveals that the Indian continent moved northwards at exceptionally high speeds (18-20 cm/year) and subsequently slowed down to 4-5 cm/year after its collision with Asia ≈40 Myr ago. This super mobility has been explained by an unusually thin Indian lithosphere (≈100 km; Kumar et al., 2007) in contradiction with the thick lithosphere that commonly underlies old cratonic nuclei. It is pertinent to note that the thermobarometric estimates on the ultramafic xenoliths from 65 Myr kimberlites of the Central India (Babu et al. 2009) suggest an approximately 175 km thick lithosphere. Also, recent results of P and S wave travel time tomography of India suggest that the lithospheric roots are not uniformly thick on a regional scale. Although high velocity roots typical of Precambrian shields are preserved beneath a few cratons of the Indian shield, they seem to have suffered attrition, in the plume ravaged regions like the NDVP and the Southern SGT (Singh et al., 2014). We assembled a new massive surface wave database towards obtaining 3D isotropic and anisotropic models for the Indian sub-continent, using surface waves. This necessitated processing of data from more than 500 seismic broadband stations across India and surrounding regions. Surface waves group and phase dispersion measurements are performed in a broad frequency range (16-250s). Our phase velocity anomaly maps recover most of the known geological structures. The cratons are associated with high velocity (4-6%) anomalies till 200 sec, with the WDC being faster than the EDC. Slow velocities in NW India and very high velocity anomalies (6-8%) beneath the central part of the Indo-Gangetic plains are possibly associated with the subducting Indian lithosphere. The LAB depths inferred from isotropic depth inversion reveal a very large variability around 120 km to 210 km thick beneath craton. Depth inversion incorporating anisotropy, is in progress. We observe that the best resolved parameters are the transversal shear wave velocities, radial anisotropy and fast axis directions. These play a key role in mapping the LAB",

The absence of IP25 during 18 and 16 ka indicate that the western Laptev Sea was mostly covered with permanent sea ice (pack ice). However, a period of temporary break-up of the permanent ice coverage occurred at c. 17.2 ka (presence of IP25). Very little river-runoff occurred during this interval. Decreasing terrigenous (riverine) input and synchronous increase of marine produced organic matter around 16 ka until 7.5 ka indicate the gradual establishment of a marine environment in the western Laptev Sea related to the onset of the post-glacial transgression of the shelf. Strong river run-off and reduced sea ice cover characterized the time interval between 15.2 and 12.9 ka, including the Bølling/Allerød warm period (14.7 - 12.9 ka). Moreover, the DIP25 Index (ratio of HBI-dienes and IP25) might document the presence of Atlantic derived water at the western Laptev Sea shelf area. A sudden return to severe sea ice conditions occurred during the Younger Dryas (12.9 - 11.6 ka). This abrupt climate change was observed in the whole circum-Arctic realm (Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, Fram Strait and Laptev Sea). At the onset of the Younger Dryas, a distinct alteration of the ecosystem (deep drop in terrigenous and phytoplankton biomarkers) may document the entry of a giant freshwater plume, possibly relating to the Lake Agassiz outburst at 13 ka. IP25 concentrations increase and higher values of the PIP25 Index during the last 7 ka reflect a cooling of the Laptev Sea spring season. Moreover, a short-term variability of c. 1.5 thousand years occurred during the last 12 ka, most probably following Bond Cycles.",

Phys., 45, 425202, 2012], but the increase of the electric field involved in this process is accompanied by a strong increase of the conductivity, which in turn makes this electric field collapse over a few tens of picoseconds, preventing the production of significant X-ray emissions [Ihaddadene and Celestin, GRL, 45, 5644, 2015].\nMoreover, it has been reported that X-ray emission in laboratory spark discharges is influenced by the time derivative of the applied voltage [March and Montanya, GRL, 37, L19801, 2010]. Additionally, Celestin and Pasko [JGR, 116, A03315, 2011, Section 3.3] have indicated that quickly increasing applied voltages had an impact on peak electric fields in streamer numerical models.\nIn this work, we simulate numerically the effect of impulsive applied electric fields on the dynamics of streamer discharges in air at ground level and investigate conditions under which production of thermal runaway electrons and the associated X-rays is possible.",

            "abstract": "This work presents the capabilities of a model, i.e. the tRIBS-VEGGIE-Landslide, in two different versions, i.e. developed within a probabilistic framework and coupled with a root cohesion module. The probabilistic model treats geotechnical and soil retention curve parameters as random variables across the basin and estimates theoretical probability distributions of slope stability and the associated “factor of safety” commonly used to describe the occurrence of shallow landslides. The derived distributions are used to obtain the spatio-temporal dynamics of probability of failure, conditioned on soil moisture dynamics at each watershed location. The framework has been tested in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Puerto Rico) where shallow landslides are common. In particular, the methodology was used to evaluate how the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation, whose variability is significant over the basin, affect the distribution of probability of failure.\nAnother version of the model accounts for the additional cohesion exerted by vegetation roots. The approach is to use the Fiber Bundle Model (FBM) framework that allows for the evaluation of the root strength as a function of the stress-strain relationships of bundles of fibers. The model requires the knowledge of the root architecture to evaluate the additional reinforcement from each root diameter class. The root architecture is represented with a branching topology model based on Leonardo’s rule. The methodology has been tested on a simple case study to explore the role of both hydrological and mechanical root effects. Results demonstrate that the effects of root water uptake can at times be more significant than the mechanical reinforcement; and that the additional resistance provided by roots depends heavily on the vegetation root structure and length.",

A core goal of the RIS4E Education and Communication (E&C) plan is to increase the accessibility of science to the general public, both by teaching scientists how to communicate their work to the public and by training the next generation of science journalists.\nDuring the Spring 2015 semester, eight Stony Brook University journalism students, ranging from Sophomores through M.A. students, participated in a new Science Journalism course in the School of Journalism. During the semester, the students learned about the science being conducted by the RIS4E team, took field trips to labs, interviewed scientists and graduate students, and produced print and video pieces about the science and the scientists. As a capstone project, five of the students, along with a professor and TA, were embedded with the RIS4E field geology team during their 2015 field season at the 1974 Kilauea lava flow on the Big Island of Hawaii. During their time in Hawaii, the journalism students had complete access to the field team, both during work and after-work hours. For each of the students, it was their first exposure to the practice of science, made possible through the experience of watching scientists formulate and test hypotheses in real time. They posted daily blog updates about the work being done by the field team and acquired dozens of hours of video footage to be produced into longer pieces.\nThis presentation will describe the unique Stony Brook Science Journalism course and the experiences of the students both in the classroom and in the field. We will highlight both the successes and the lessons learned, for both the students and the scientists involved, and discuss our plans to conduct a second class in 2017, when the students will accompany the RIS4E field team to the Potrillo Volcanic Field in New Mexico.",

            "abstract": "Whistler waves are a ubiquitous plasma phenomenon, observed in a variety of space and laboratory plasma environments. They play a key role in many important and diverse processes, such as particle acceleration in the radiation belts and auroral acceleration region, the dissipation of plasma turbulence at small scales below the inertial range, collisionless shock physics, and magnetic reconnection. In reconnection they may modify the reconnection rate and also whistler physics is crucial to enabling fast reconnection in the Hall reconnection model.\nConsequently, understanding how whistler waves are generated and how they subsequently interact with the plasma is a problem of wide importance and application. It is well known that whistlers can arise as a result of kinetic instabilities, which grow exponentially from noise as a consequence of unstable electron distributions, for example temperature anisotropy. This is used ubiquitously to predict where and when whistler waves are likely to exist and therefore be of importance in many plasma phenomena. Recently it has been demonstrated theoretically and via computer simulations that whistler waves may also arise via Cerenkov emission from electron hole quasi-particles [Goldman et al., PRL, 2014]. Such wave emission can arise even when the temperature anisotropy leads to damping; in this case the system is analogous to a damped forced oscillator.\nHere we present novel experimental analysis from THEMIS showing for the first time evidence consistent with the generation of whistlers via Cerenkov emission during magnetotail reconnection. By considering the electromagnetic properties of the electron holes, the amplitude, phase speed and frequency of the associated whistlers, and also the available sub-spin observations of the electron distribution function, we find that the data are best explained by the Cerenkov emission theory rather than by kinetic instabilities due to the electron temperature anisotropy. Whilst the observations presented here were made in a reconnection outflow jet, it is suggested that Cerenkov-emission of whistlers may in fact be a common phenomenon in space and laboratory plasmas.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic systems in peatland catchments are subject to high loading of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from surrounding terrestrial environments. However the significance of photochemical transformation of DOM in peatland carbon budgets remains poorly constrained. In this study UV irradiation experiments were conducted on water samples collected over one year from two contrasting systems in Scotland: a stream draining a peatland with high levels of DOM and a reservoir draining a peat catchment with low levels of DOM. Further samples were collected from the high DOM system during two storm events. After experimental exposure, optical and chemical analyses were employed to determine photochemical lability of the DOM pool. At both sites irradiation-induced decreases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a percentage of the total carbon pool were greatest in winter, suggesting that DOM was depleted in photo-reactive molecules in summer. Seasonal variability in DOC was high at the stream site and was positively correlated with CO₂ and CO photoproduction (r2 = 0.81 and 0.83, respectively; p<0.05). Lignin phenol analyses indicate considerable contribution of peat to the DOM pool at the stream site, particularly during summer. Whilst DOC concentrations did not vary greatly during storm events, UV-Vis absorbance indicators did, signifying changing DOM source material from activation of different hydrological pathways. The most photo-reactive DOM occurred 5-10 hours after peak discharge, suggesting that storms replenish photochemically labile DOM in headwater streams. Conservative estimates using data from this study suggest that up to 7% of the DOM pool of peatland streams can be lost (primarily as CO₂ and CO) upon exposure to 8 hours of environmentally representative UV irradiation. Further investigation in field campaigns under natural UV exposure are underway to assess the importance of photodegradation of DOM as a loss pathway of carbon based gases from aquatic systems.",

            "abstract": "We present the “first generation” global adjoint tomography model based on 3D wave simulations, which is the result of 15 conjugate-gradient iterations with confined transverse isotropy to the upper mantle. Our starting model is the 3D mantle and crustal models S362ANI (Kustowski et al. 2008) and Crust2.0 (Bassin et al. 2000), respectively. We take into account the full nonlinearity of wave propagation in numerical simulations including attenuation (both in forward and adjoint simulations), topography/bathymetry, etc., using the GPU version of the SPECFEM3D_GLOBE package. We invert for crust and mantle together without crustal corrections to avoid any bias in mantle structure.\nWe started with an initial selection of 253 global CMT events within the magnitude range 5.8 ≤ Mw ≤ 7.0 with numerical simulations having resolution down to 27 s combining 30-s body and 60-s surface waves. After the 12th iteration we increased the resolution to 17 s, including higher-frequency body waves as well as going down to 45 s in surface-wave measurements. We run 180-min seismograms and assimilate all minor- and major-arc body and surface waves.\nOur 15th iteration model update shows a tantalisingly enhanced image of the Tahiti plume as well as various other plumes and hotspots, such as Caroline, Galapagos, Yellowstone, Erebus, etc. Furthermore, we see clear improvements in slab resolution along the Hellenic and Japan Arcs, as well as subduction along the East of Scotia Plate, which does not exist in the initial model. Point-spread function tests (Fichtner & Trampert 2011) suggest that we are close to the resolution of continental-scale studies in our global inversions and able to confidently map features, for instance, at the scale of the Yellowstone hotspot. This is a clear consequence of our multi-scale smoothing strategy, in which we define our smoothing operator as a function of the approximate Hessian kernel and smooth our gradients less wherever we have good ray coverage, such as underneath North America.\nWe perform our simulations on Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Cray XK7 Titan system. The iterations will continue with a better, more general model parameterisation accommodating general azimuthal anisotropy. Our ultimate aim is to go down to 9 s resolution in our simulations together with assimilating a selection of ~4,200 earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The cloud detection algorithm for passive sensors is usually based on a fuzzy logic system with thresholds determined from previous observations. In recent years, haze and high aerosol concentrations with high AOD occur frequently in China and may critically impact the accuracy of the MODIS cloud detection. Thus, we comprehensively explore this impact by comparing the results from MODIS/Aqua (passive sensor), CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar sensor), and CPR/CloudSat (microwave sensor) of the A-Train suite of instruments using an averaged AOD as an index for an aerosol concentration value. Case studies concerning the comparison of the three sensors indicate that MODIS cloud detection is reduced during haze events. In addition, statistical studies show that an increase in AOD creates an increase in the percentage of uncertain flags and a decrease in hit rate, a consistency index between consecutive sets of cloud retrievals. Therefore, we can conclude that the ability of MODIS cloud detection is weakened by large concentrations of aerosols. This suggests that use of the MODIS cloud mask, and derived higher level products, in situations with haze requires caution. Further improvement of this retrieval algorithm, is desired as haze studies based on MODIS products are of great interest in a number of related fields.",

            "abstract": "The coarse mode aerosols observed in the nature are mostly related to dust and especially mineral desert dust. The mineral dust has very significant influence on environment and climate. Therefore, it has always been one of the main subjects of global and regional remote sensing monitoring. This presentation will outline the challenges and possible prospective of characterizing the desert dust using remote sensing observation. The optical properties of desert dust have several particular features that distinguish it from other type of aerosols and needed to be accounted in remote sensing methods. Specifically the particles of desert dust are rather large, non-spherical, notably absorbing in UV and nearly non-absorbing in near IR, etc. Correspondingly, the sensitivities of the various remote sensing observations are quite different. For example, it is very difficult adequately characterize desert dust from space over very bright land surfaces. Another challenge is characterization of desert dust size distribution shape especially for very large particles. From the viewpoint of the modeling of optical properties, the main problem is the development of adequate model for accounting for particle non-sphericity. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss how these complications are addressed in existing methods of remote sensing observations including both passive (spectral, multi-angular and polarimetric) and active observations. Some rather new methods utilizing different types of observations will be also discussed.",

In the current stages of the project, we have focussed on the public dissemination of space missions (Rosetta and New Horizons) as well as the support of space weather forecasting. The presented work will focus on the latter of these foci and elaborate on the efforts that have gone into developing a system that allows the user to assess the accuracy and validity of ENLIL ensemble simulations. It becomes possible to compare the results of ENLIL CME simulations with STEREO and SOHO images using an optical flow algorithm. This allows the user to compare velocities in the volumetric rendering of ENLIL data with the movement of CMEs through the field-of-views of various instruments onboard the space craft. By allowing the user access to these comparisons, new information about the time evolution of CMEs through the interplanetary medium is possible. Additionally, contextualizing this information in three-dimensional rendering scene, allows the analyst and the public to disseminate this data. This dissemination is further improved by the ability to connect multiple instances of the software and, thus, reach a broader audience. In a second step, we plan to combine the two foci of the project to enable the visualization of the SWAP instrument onboard New Horizons in context with a far-reaching ENLIL simulation, thus providing additional information about the solar wind dynamics of the outer solar system.

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is the most abundant sulfur‑containing trace gas present in the troposphere at concentrations of around 500 ppt. Recent interest in COS by the ecosystem-physiological community has been sparked by the fact that COS co-diffuses into plant leaves pretty much the same way as carbon dioxide (CO2) does, but in contrast to CO2, COS is not known to be emitted by plants. Thus uptake of COS by vegetation has the potential to be used as a tracer for canopy gross photosynthesis, which cannot be measured directly, however represents a key term in the global carbon cycle.\nThe use of COS as a tracer for canopy gross photosynthesis relies on the assumption that other sinks or sources of COS within an ecosystem are negligible, so that the COS exchange is through leaves only. Here we use concurrent COS and CO2 ecosystem-scale eddy covariance and soil chamber flux measurements together with within and above-canopy concentration profiles and an inverse Lagrangian analysis to disentangle sinks and sources of COS in a temperate mountain grassland.\nPreliminary results from the vegetation period 2015 suggest the soil at this grassland site to present a source of COS during daytime, which is corroborated by the inverse Lagrangian analysis which infers a COS source in the lowermost part of the canopy, while during nighttime the soil COS exchange is close to zero. At the ecosystem-scale a net uptake of COS was observed throughout the day, which in turn suggests (i) a sink for COS in the plant canopy during nighttime and (ii) a larger (compared to the net flux) gross uptake of COS by the plant canopy during daytime.\nTaken together our results suggest that using COS as a tracer for canopy gross photosynthesis may be less straight forward than previously thought and that further work is required to better understand the ecosystem-scale COS exchange and its drivers.",

The first product developed under this framework were flood inundation maps, with and without sea level rise, for varying return periods for RI coastal waters. The flood mapping methodology is based on using the water level vs return periods at a primary NOAA water level gauging station and then spatially scaling the values, based on the predictions of high resolution, storm and wave simulations performed by Army Corp of Engineers, North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study (NACCS) for tropical and extratropical storms on an unstructured grid, to estimate inundation levels for varying return periods. The scaling for the RI application used Newport, RI water levels as the reference point. Predictions are provided for once in 25, 50, and 100 yr return periods (at the upper 95% confidence level), with sea level rises of 1, 2, 3, and 5 ft. Simulations have also been performed for historical hurricane events including 1938, Carol (1954), Bob (1991), and Sandy (2012) and nuisance flooding events with return periods of 1, 3, 5, and 10 yr. Access to the flooding maps is via a web based, map viewer that seamlessly covers all coastal waters of the state at one meter resolution. The GIS structure of the map viewer allows overlays of additional relevant data sets (roads and highways, wastewater treatment facilities, schools, hospitals, emergency evacuation routes, etc.) as desired by the user. The simplified flooding maps are publically available and are now being implemented for state and community resilience planning and vulnerability assessment activities in response to climate change impacts.",

            "abstract": "Analyses based on satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and land surface model data indicate that groundwater storage in Victoria, Australia had been declining steadily, until a trend reversal around early 2010, attributed to two wetter seasons in 2010 and 2011. In situ groundwater level measurements (from a network of 1395 bores in Victoria) also indicate a steady groundwater depletion since early 90’s, and show remarkable agreement with GRACE estimates for the 10-year period (2003-2012) in common with the GRACE mission. Groundwater depletion rates for 2005 to 2009 are relatively large as indicated by both GRACE estimates (8.0 ± 1.7 km3/yr) and in situ measurements (8.3 ± 3.4 km3/yr). Over the same period (2005-2009), GRACE measurements capture significant groundwater depletion in a wider region covering much of the southern Murray-Darling Basin, and the total groundwater depletion rate in this region is about 17.2 ± 4.7 km3/yr. Annual groundwater storage changes are strongly correlated with precipitation anomalies, but magnitudes of anomalous precipitation and groundwater storage suggest that only about one-fifth of anomalous precipitation contributes to groundwater recharge. The strong correlation suggests that this significant groundwater depletion is primarily related to drought (plus groundwater pumping for agricultural and domestic consumption). This study shows the importance of reducing leakage bias in GRACE observations through post data processings. The remarkable agreement between GRACE estimates and in situ measurements demonstrates the great potentials of using satellite gravity observations in combination with land surface model estimates to quantify changes in regional groundwater resources, especially when in situ measurements are limited or unavailable.",

The magnetic minerals could be neoformed/altered by thermal process within fault zone. In this study, we aim to estimate the paleotemperature by using low-temperature magnetic analyses (10K-300K) of wall rock (Chinshui Shale) and fault gouge zone from Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project (TCDP). A piece of hanging wall rock sample from FZB1194 (fault zone within Hole-B at depth of 1,194 m) was grinded to powder and was stepwise heated within argon atmosphere from 90 to 550 ºC for one hour. The starting material is characterized by a very high content of nanoparticles. During laboratory heating, we observed the gradual destruction of the content of nanoparticles in the range 120°C up to 350°C, and the disappearance of Verwey transition at temperature higher than 350°C. The FZB1194 and FZB1243 were sampled from upper to lower parts including deformed sediments, black material disks, and black gouge zones. The magnetic analysis results show trends that we attribute to paleotemperature reached within the gouge. The deformed sediments seem unheated with respect to Chinshui Shales. In contrast, the proxy of paleotemperature of black material disk and gouge indicate >350°C and <250°C respectively. Tracking paleotemperature along a profile permits to identify several seismic events in the same gouge zone.",

One way to explore these processes is to directly measure the stable intermediate oxidation products. Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS) has proven to be a powerful tool to sensitively detect with high time resolution photooxidation products in the atmosphere such as hydroperoxides, acids, nitrates, and other oxygenated volatile organic compounds. Despite the potential to elucidate atmospheric photooxidation in detail, field observations of such compounds are sparse.\nHere we present the development of a new Gas Chromatograph Time-of-Flight Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (GC-ToF-CIMS) for field deployment. Using low pressure gas chromatography and CF3O- ionization chemistry, the selective operation of a GC is combined with the sensitive, specific, and fast detection of a high-resolution ToF-CIMS. The combination of chromatographic separation and exact mass identification allows detecting isomer resolved photooxidation products. Direct measurements in the atmosphere of such isomer distributions are particularly interesting due to the broad range of their individual atmospheric lifetimes and impacts.",

The development of the aquifer has changed the landscape and the water cycle of the region. This study illustrates the evolving patterns of land use and the effects of cultivation, from irrigated to dryland farming to the countermanding influence of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Previous research indicates that greater recharge rates occur under cultivated land in the Southern High Plains than under unbroken soil: the transition to cultivation causes increased recharge, under both dryland and irrigated management, though most recharge still occurs through playa lakes. The Conservation Reserve Program takes land out of crop production, replacing the land cover with something more like the natural ecosystem. This may decrease recharge below fields, and reduce runoff that feeds playa lakes; or, CRP may help stabilize playa lakes, increasing recharge. Changes to the water cycle are investigated at the field scale using the System Approach to Land Use Sustainability (SALUS) crop model, and at the regional scale with the Landscape Hydrology Model (LHM), and compared with historical data and water table elevations.",

It requires the sustained production of high quality, multidecadal time series data describing the global atmosphere, oceans, and land surface that can be used for informed decision making. The challenges of a long-term program of sustaining CDRs, as contrasted with short-term efforts of traditional three-year research programs, are substantial and different. The sustained production of CDRs requires collaboration between experts in the climate community, data management, and software development and maintenance. It is also informed by scientific application and associated user feedback on the accessibility and usability of the produced CDRs. The CDR Program has developed a metric for assessing the maturity of CDRs with respect to data management, software, and user application and applied it to over 28 CDRs. The main/primary lesson learned over the past seven years is that a rigorous, team approach to data management, employing subject matter experts at every step, is critical to open and transparent production. This approach also makes it much easier to support the needs of users who want near-real-time production of “interim” CDRs for monitoring and users who want to use CDRs for tailored authoritative information, such as a drought index. This talk will review of the history of the CDR program, current status, and plans.",

            "abstract": "Heping area of Hualien in the NE Taiwan is located at the region of subduction flip of oblique convergence between the Philippine Sea and Eurasian Plates. The ductile deformation in the region is consisted of the development of N65E-striking foliation and N60W-trending stretching lineation with top-to-southeastern shear. Distinguished mylonitic gneissosity is observed near the lithology contact between the marble and meta-granite but the flow occurrence of granite is still found in the downstream area of meta-granite core. To investigate the deformation pattern and the development of mylonization of meta-granite, study of magnetic fabrics across the meta-granite body is conducted via anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) to evaluate the strain path of gneissosity development.\nAMS results show that the attitude of magnetic foliation and lineation is consistent with that of genissosity and stretching lineation. From the core to the lithology contact of meta-granite, generally anisotropy is increasing and susceptibility ellipsoids change from prolate to oblate. However due to different shearing on gneissosity, the anisotropy and magnetic ellipsoid vary pretty much even in the same site. Based on current analyses among meta-granitic and mylonitic samples, it suggested that strain path of mylonitization is evolved from prolate shape with low-anisotropy in the meta-granitic core through oblate shape with low-anisotropy in weakly gneissic samples to various ellipsoids from oblate to prolate with high-anisotropy in mylonitic samples. Our findings provide insights into understanding the deformation pattern across the meta-granite body and further establishing the strain path of mylonitic gneissosity development. Further studies of identifying magnetic carrier(s) and domain size to evaluate influences of magnetic minerals to the AMS pattern are needed.",

Different estimating formulations and different input data reliabilities existing in practice determine there may be potential uncertainty in projection of future reference evapotranspiration change. Should we use more reliable physically-based methods (e.g., Penman–Monteith) but with insufficient or uncertain data quality, or should we employ more empirical methods (e.g., temperature-based methods) with more reliable input data. Three different approaches were used to explore the method dependence in projection of the future reference evapotranspiration. Uncertainties lied in estimating how much the reference evapotranspiration changed. Yet meanwhile, in a certain degree, coincident results on the overall pattern of further deduced aridity index and water surplus changes based on reference evapotranspiration by these three approaches place an important basis to develop robust and equitable water management adaptation to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Urban water supply systems may be managed through supply-side and demand-side strategies, which focus on water source expansion and demand reductions, respectively. Supply-side strategies bear infrastructure and energy costs, while demand-side strategies bear costs of implementation and inconvenience to consumers. To evaluate the performance of demand-side strategies, the participation and water use adaptations of consumers should be simulated. In this study, a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) framework is developed to simulate consumer agents that change their consumption to affect the withdrawal from the water supply system, which, in turn influences operational policies and long-term resource planning. Agent-based models are encoded to represent consumers and a policy maker agent and are coupled with water resources system simulation models. The CAS framework is coupled with an evolutionary computation-based multi-objective methodology to explore tradeoffs in cost, inconvenience to consumers, and environmental impacts for both supply-side and demand-side strategies. Decisions are identified to specify storage levels in a reservoir that trigger (1) increases in the volume of water pumped through inter-basin transfers from an external reservoir and (2) drought stages, which restrict the volume of water that is allowed for residential outdoor uses. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for Arlington, Texas, water supply system to identify non-dominated strategies for an historic drought decade. Results demonstrate that pumping costs associated with maximizing environmental reliability exceed pumping costs associated with minimizing restrictions on consumer water use.",

The earthquake ruptured a 150x50km elliptical patch striking parallel to the Himalayan front located north of Kathmandu. This asperity represents only a small fraction of the previous locked portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) along which the Himalaya is thrust over India. The earthquake initiated at western end of the ruptured patch, 75km northwest of Kathmandu. It produced a slip pulse of ~20 km width, ~6 s duration with peak sliding velocity of ~1 m/s which propagated eastwards at ~2.8 km/s. High frequency seismic waves (~ 1 Hz) were radiated continuously as the earthquake unzipped the northern edge of the locked portion of the of the MHT, a zone of presumably high and heterogeneous pre-seismic stress. Most of the moment was actually released south, hence, updip, of the sources of high frequency seismic waves. The slip pulse there shows a remarkable smooth onset indicating a large effective slip-weakening distance of several meters. This smooth onset can explain the moderate ground shaking at high frequencies (>1Hz) and the limited damage to regular few-storey high dwellings within Kathmandu basin. By contrast, the entire basin resonated at ~4-5 s for 30s resulting in the collapse of some tall buildings. The study suggests a deterministic control, of probably structural origin, of the source characteristics and induced ground shaking.",

Study area in this paper covers three typical peri-urban districts (Pudong, Fengxian and Jinshan), which around the Shanghai inner city. By coupling cellular automata and multi-agent system model as the basic tools, this research focus on modelling the urban land expansion and driving mechanism in peri-urban area. The big data is aslo combined with the Bayesian maximum entropy method (BME) for spatiotemporal prediction of multi-source data, which expand the dataset of urban expansion models. Data assimilation method is used to optimize the parameters of the coupling model and minimize the uncertainty of observations, improving the precision of future simulation in peri-urban area. By setting quantitative parameters, the coupling model can effectively improve the simulation of the process of urban land expansion under different policies and management schemes, in order to provide scientificimplications for new urbanization strategy. In this research, we precise the urban land expansion simulation and prediction for peri-urban area, expand the scopes and selections of data acquisition measurements and methods, develop the new applications of the data assimilation method in geographical science, provide a new idea for understanding the inherent rules of urban land expansion, and give theoretical and practical support for the peri-urban area in urban planning and decision making.",

            "abstract": "MESSENGER’s exploration of Mercury has revealed the planet’s rich and dynamic history and provided new constraints on the processes that control its internal evolution. Mercury’s surface records evidence of an extensive geological history. This evidence includes resurfacing by impacts and volcanism prior to the end of the late heavy bombardment (LHB) and a subsequent rapid waning of effusive volcanism. Volcanism is an important indicator of the history of melt production. Thousands of globally distributed, contractional tectonic landforms collectively have accommodated a decrease in Mercury’s radius of 5–7 km since the end of the LHB. Such contraction results from planetary cooling and crystallization within Mercury’s metallic core. Measurements of surface chemistry have provided constraints on internal radiogenic heat production necessary to understand more fully Mercury’s thermal evolution. Elemental abundances also reveal that Mercury is strongly chemically reduced, suggesting that the core’s iron is alloyed with silicon as well as sulfur, which constrains the dynamics and crystallization of the metallic core. Magnetometer observations show that Mercury’s dynamo-generated, dominantly dipolar field is displaced ~500 km northward along the rotation axis. Low-altitude magnetic field observations late in the mission led to the discovery of crustal magnetization in Mercury’s ancient crust, dating to at least 3.7 Ga, which places a new constraint on the timing of the dynamo. Monte Carlo parameterized mantle convection models, constrained by these observations, indicate that for global contraction of 7 km or less, mantle convection persists to the present ~40% of the time, with the likelihood of modern convection decreasing with less global contraction. Slow present cooling in these models indicates that dynamo generation is strongly influenced by both a static layer at the top of the core and convective motions within the core driven by compositional buoyancy.",

The fast moving lower layer lagged the slow moving, dilute flow front by 14 min, which we infer resulted from the interaction of two initial pulses. The two layers were strongly coupled, and the sharp interface between the layers was characterized by a wave-like instability. This is the first field-scale data from a turbidity current to show (i) the complex dynamics of the head of a turbidity current and (ii) the presence of multiple layers within the same event. This data set provides a new perspective on the character of turbidity currents in the ocean. The data pose challenges not simply for understanding the dynamics of turbidity currents but also for how we interpret existing data based on cable breaks and how we might measure similar flows in the future.",

            "abstract": "This study draws upon the definition of water sustainability from the National Water Research Institute as the continual supply of clean water for human uses and for other living beings without compromising the water welfare of future generations. Currently, the greatest consumer of water resources worldwide is irrigation. The move from small-scale, family farms towards corporately owned and market driven, mass scale operations have drastically increased corn production and large-scale factory hog farming in the American Midwest—and the water quality related costs associated with this shift are well-documented. In the heart of the corn belt, the state of Iowa has dealt with issues over the past two decades ranging from flooding of historic proportions, to yield destroying droughts. Most recently, the state’s water quality is intensely scrutinized due to nutrient levels higher than almost anywhere else in the world. While the changed agricultural landscape is ultimately responsible for these environmental costs, they can be mitigated if the farmers adopt practices that support water sustainability. However, many Iowa farmers have yet to embrace these necessary practices because of a lack of proper education in this context. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore how water sustainability is being conceptualized within the agricultural realm, and ultimately, how the issues are being communicated and understood within various subgroups in Iowa, such as the farmers, the college students, and the general public.",

            "abstract": "Metamodels of environmental behavior offer opportunities for decision support, adaptive management, and increased stakeholder engagement through participatory modeling and model exploration. Metamodels are derived from calibrated, computationally demanding, numerical models. They may potentially be applied to non-modeled areas to provide screening or preliminary analysis tools for areas that do not yet have the benefit of more comprehensive study. In this decision-support mode, they may be fulfilling a role often accomplished by application of analytical solutions. The major challenge to transferring a metamodel to a non-modeled area is how to quantify the spatial data in the new area of interest in such a way that it is consistent with the data used to derive the metamodel. Tests based on transferring a metamodel derived from a numerical groundwater-flow model of the Lake Michigan Basin to other glacial settings across the northern U.S. show that the spatial scale of the numerical model must be appropriately scaled to adequately represent different settings. Careful GIS analysis of the numerical model, metamodel, and new area of interest is required for successful transfer of results.",

            "abstract": "The Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) is an extreme event which occurred in the Mediterranean Basin at the end of the Miocene (5.97 to 5.33 Ma) resulting in thick evaporite deposits. There is evidence of restriction of the Atlantic-Mediterranean corridor several million years before the first evaporites. These pre-MSC successions are dominated by precession-controlled lithological variations which are putative responses to changing fluvial runoff. Recent climate simulations indicate that runoff into the Eastern Mediterranean is influenced by monsoonal precipitation from the North African continent. The Sorbas Basin in Spain and the Pissouri Section on Cyprus both contain pre-MSC successions from the margins of the Mediterranean Basin. We analysed biomarkers in conjunction with existing faunal records to understand whether simulated runoff changes were manifested in the sedimentological record and organic matter assemblages. This multi-proxy dataset allows us to compare the environmental evolution of the western vs. eastern basins prior to the MSC and allows us to test both climate models for Messinian climate variabitly and conceptual models for sedimentation. In the Sorbas Basin, pronounced orbital changes in faunal assemblages reflect Mediterrannean influences into the local Sorbas system; however, these are not manifested in biomarker assemblages, which are likely governed by more local hydrological processes, which in the Western Mediterranean lacked a strong precessional control. In the Pissouri Basin, however, terrigeous OM inputs sources exhibit strong orbital variations, suggesting a close link to precessionally driven changes in rainfall. Together, these results validate the sapropel formation hypothesis in the Mediterranean and confirm a strong precessional control on the African monsoon during the late Miocene; however, they also reveal the complex controls on the hydrology and sedimentology of marginal Mediterranean basins, such as the Sorbas Basin.",

            "abstract": "The development of sand bed morphology in response to steady flow is adequately described in most bedform phase diagrams. This includes the prediction of bedform wavelength, height and shape, all important parameters in estimating flow resistance. However, during time-varying flow, such as that experienced during the passage of a flood wave, the implicit assumption that bedform adjustment tracks changes in flow depth and velocity does not hold true due to bedform hysteresis. Consequently, there is a need to understand which characteristics of unsteady flow drive the disequilibrium dynamics between bedform geometry and hydraulic conditions. This paper describes a series of experiments designed to identify the impacts of hydrograph characteristics on the morphodynamic evolution of alluvial dunes. Mobile sand bed (D50 of 450μm) experiments were undertaken in a 16m long, 1.6m wide flume. Sediment was water worked under steady unidirectional flow until equilibrium bed conditions were achieved, after which a hydrograph was applied. At the end of the hydrograph, a period of steady flow was once again run until equilibrium conditions were attained. Hydrograph one consisted of steeply rising (80 minutes) and falling (65 minutes) limbs with hydrograph two characterised by longer rising (170 minutes) and falling (230 minutes) limbs. During the hydrograph discharge was changed in discrete steps. Bed morphology profiles were measured continuously along a 5m by 0.6m, centreline transect using twelve ultrasonic sensors. Three-dimensional flow was measured with a stack of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters downstream of the transect. Suspended sediment was quantified using a three-frequency set of Acoustic Backscatter Sensors. The impact of these differing hydrograph characteristics are discussed in terms of differences between equilibrium bed morphologies, evolving flow field characteristics and the dynamics of suspended sediment concentrations through the hydrographs.",

A key component of dataset and stewardship models maturity is data quality and documentation of the quality. The Data Stewardship Maturity Matrix(DSMM) developed in partnership with NOAA’s National Centers of Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites–North Carolina (CICS-NC) has been used to assess stewardship maturity of highly-utilized datasets within NCEI. Consistent application of the model across heterogenous data types (satellite, in situ, regional, global, etc.) and across multiple levels of stewardship support has proven beneficial but challenging.\nThis presentation will demonstrate the utility of the DSMM through results from use case studies and its application for documenting data quality, indicate the challenges of consistent implementation and provide recommendations on improved application.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes can trigger landslides in mountain belts and erode significant volumes of clastic sediment that is supplied to rivers. Organic carbon eroded by landslides has been viewed as a source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, on the basis that organic material is oxidized in the landscape. However, export of this organic carbon by rivers while sediment loads are elevated may instead contribute to a long-term CO2 sink through sedimentary burial. This process could provide a direct coupling between active tectonics, the carbon cycle and CO2 drawdown. Despite this recognition, the fate of biospheric carbon eroded by earthquake landslides remains unconstrained.\nHere we quantify particulate organic carbon (POC) export in the Zagunao River before and after the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. We use radiocarbon and stable carbon isotopes to correct for rock-derived organic carbon, and we then quantify the flux of POC eroded from the biosphere. We find that biospheric carbon export fluxes doubled in the years following the earthquake, demonstrating the rapid export of earthquake-mobilized carbon by rivers. To examine the decadal impacts, we use measurements until the end of 2011 and a model which considers both particulate organic carbon export and its degradation in the landscape. We estimate that the majority of the earthquake-mobilized organic carbon will be exported by rivers rather than remaining in situ and being oxidized. While the ultimate fate of this material remains to be assessed, enhanced sediment discharge may promote sedimentary burial and long-term preservation. Our findings suggest that erosion of biospheric carbon by earthquake-triggered landslides can directly link active tectonics and mountain building to the drawdown of CO2.",

            "abstract": "Predictions of the how forest productivity and carbon sequestration will respond to climate change are essential for assisting land managers in adapting to future climate. However, current predictions can include considerable uncertainty that is often not well quantified. To address the need for better quantification of uncertainty, we calculated and compared parameter and climate prediction uncertainty for predictions of Southeastern U.S. pine forest productivity. We used a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based data assimilation technique to fuse regionally widespread and diverse datasets with the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth model (3PG) model. The datasets incorporated include biomass observations from forest research plots that are part of the Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation project (PINEMAP) project, photosynthesis and evaporation observations from loblolly pine Ameriflux sites, and productivity responses to elevated CO2 from the Duke Free Air C site. These spatially and temporally diverse data sets give our unique analysis a more accurately measured uncertainty by constraining complimentary components of the model. In our analysis, parameter uncertainty was quantified using simulations that integrate across the posterior parameter distributions, while climate model uncertainty was quantified using downscaled RCP 8.5 simulations from twenty different CMIP5 climate models. Overall, we found that the uncertainty in future productivity of Southeastern U.S. managed pine forests that was associated with parameterization is comparable to the uncertainty associated with climate simulations. Our results indicate that reducing parameterization in ecosystem model development can improve future predictions of forest productivity and carbon sequestration, but uncertainties in future climate predictions also need to be properly quantified and communicated to forest owners and managers.",

            "abstract": "Snow area measurement is very important for hydrologists, glaciologists and for climate change researchers. Field measurement is very difficult as in case of a steep and in a complex terrain such as Himalayas, therefore we rely on remote sensing (both active and passive) data. Usually snow area is calculated from reflectance data using different snow index e.g. Normalize difference snow index (NDSI) and then it is translated into snow area. However, in most cases we are actually calculating the planimetric area or grid area of every pixel. The actual snow is along the surface of the terrain and proper estimation can only be done if actual surface area is calculated along the slope within each pixel. In the past, some researchers have introduced methodologies and optimized old mechanisms. However, the orographical impact in calculating snow area (fraction), especially in steep mountainous regions, still has many problems, and many times these problems are usually ignored which leads to under estimation of total snow amount. In this study we calculated the actual surface area from SRTM version 4.1 90m (at equator) processed DEM data provided by CGIAR-CSI. MODIS Reflectance (MOD09A1 L3 Product) composite data of 500m resolution for 2010 and 2011 in the northern areas of Pakistan, Jammu & Kashmir region where great Himalayas are stretched was used to calculate snow cover using NDSI index. Threshold of NDSI>0.4 was set to classify snow or no snow for the clear pixels and for further classification, unmixing method (subjective pixel method only) was used to calculate snow fraction within each pixel. Results shows that in a complex terrain such as Himalayas, ratio of surface to planimetric snow area is more than 50%. This means that it should be taken into consideration for more realistic snow amount estimation. Seasonal snow fraction histogram from unmixing method indicates that NDSI measures snow cover area by 1.86 times more in cold season (maximum snow area) and 1.30 times more in summer season (minimum snow cover) than the snow area calculated from snow fraction using unmixing method.",

            "abstract": "The Aegean domain is a key area for understanding the processes of back-arc extension. Observed deformation pattern and present day kinematics result from the interaction between the southward retreat of the Hellenic trench and the westward escape of Anatolia. Using laboratory experiments designed to study lithosphere-scale deformation, we show that the overall pattern of Aegean extension requires not only the combination of trench retreat and Anatolia escape since 15 Ma but also the presence of an inherited lithosphere-scale mechanical discontinuity: the Vardar Suture Zone (VSZ). The reactivation in dextral shear of the eastern branch of the VSZ accommodates both the trench retreat (NS stretching) and the westward escape of Anatolia (EW shortening) in the Cyclades area since 15 Ma. Additionally, our model shows that the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) is a late structure in the evolution of the Aegean, initiated 10 Ma after the onset of Anatolia escape. The model displays displacement sub-domains, which result from strain partitioning instead of being “rigid microplates”, directly comparable to the present-day displacement field (GPS) of the Aegean and western Anatolia. Our modelling provides a simple way to look at the dynamics of Aegean extension in two main stages. From middle Eocene to middle Miocene, extension was only driven by the southward retreat of the Hellenic trench at a rate lower than 1 cm.y-1. Since middle Miocene, the combination of slab rollback with Anatolia westward escape, resulted in a southwest direction of trench retreat, with an accelerating rate of up to 3 cm.y-1.",

            "abstract": "A wealth of new geologic and geophysical data now exist for the Amerasia Basin, but the details of its age and the nature/kinematics of events that resulted in its formation remain elusive.\nBasement rock ages, detrital zircon signatures of sedimentary rocks, and sediment dispersal systems have been used to show how parts of the southern margin(s) of the Amerasia Basin (Arctic Alaska-Chukotka, AAC) match their rifted margin counterparts on the Eurasia and Canada side of the Amerasia Basin. Thus we know the approximate finite translations needed to restore the paleogeography of the Arctic, but not the kinematics involved.\nImportant features of the Amerasia Basin that need to be explained in a model for its opening are the age and extent of the high Arctic LIP, the linearity of the strip of continental crust represented by the Lomonosov Ridge, its right angle intersection with the Canadian Arctic margin, and the directional fault patterns mapped bathymetrically and seismically across the Alpha-Lomonosov Ridge and surrounding seafloor. Across AAC, post-Early Cretaceous oroclinal bends provide insight into strike-slip components of deformation involved in opening of the Amerasia Basin: The Chukchi syntax offsets the Brooks Range in a right-lateral sense from Wrangel Island along the Herald Arch; right-lateral motion of Arctic Alaska with respect to the Chukchi Borderland during opening of the Canada Basin; right-lateral shear in Chukotka during 100 Ma magmatism; the tight bend in the northern Verkhoyansk, result of Cretaceous right-lateral shear.\nThe land-based relationships imply a post-Early Cretaceous, younger than Barremian (~130 Ma) age for onset of magmatism and extension related to rifting and formation of the Amerasia Basin. At least two stages of extension are documented, with older E-W extension characterizing the longitude of the New Siberian Islands to Pevek, Russian Arctic, (ca.125 Ma to 100 Ma), with younger N-S extension superimposed on this system (ca. 100-80 Ma) that becomes as young as Cenozoic in the Bering Strait region. Both land and marine data support a complex opening model where rifting initiates at right angles to the Lomonosov Ridge followed by N-S rifting associated with rotation and southward translation of Arctic Alaska, the Chukchi Borderland, Chukotka and adjacent shelves.",

            "abstract": "We present a methodology and instrumentation allowing for an investigation of the major environmental aspects of Mars, such as the structure of the planetary subsurface, and the presence of electrical discharges in the atmosphere.\nThe methodology is based on the propagation of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic (EM) waves (3Hz-3kHz). These weakly attenuated waves, once generated by electrical discharges, propagate around a planet in a waveguide made of two electrically conductive spheres: the ground and the ionosphere. They are also capable of producing global EM resonances called Schumann resonances (SR).\nWhen an ELF wave is propagating from its source to a receiver, the environmental properties, such as: electrical conductivity of the waveguide boundaries, influence its propagation parameters. Using an analytical approach, we can estimate the structure of the planetary subsurface or the lower ionosphere layers on the basis of the measured parameters.\nAs there is no liquid water at the Martian surface, the Martian low-conductivity ground enables deep ELF penetration into the planetary subsurface. As a result, the presented technique can be used as a tool to detect groundwater reservoirs located even several kilometers below the surface.\nOn the basis of presently available date on the Martian subsurface, and theories of electrical properties of rocks, ice and water, we have developed probable Martian subsurface models with and without aquifers. The obtained results indicate that if aquifers are present beneath the Martian surface, the SR frequencies, the SR amplitudes, and the ELF phase velocities will be higher by about 12%, 37%, and 9%, respectively, as compare to the situation, in which there is solely a dry basaltic ground.\nAs the presented phenomenon is of the global nature, one measuring station, located at the planetary surface, is enough to perform some basic research.

            "abstract": "A Neural Network (NN)-based algorithm is developed to retrieve surface soil moisture from Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) microwave observations. This statistical approach serves as an alternative to the official Radiative Transfer (RT) based SMAP retrieval algorithm, since it avoids an explicit formulation of the RT processes as well as the use of often uncertain or unavailable a priori knowledge for additional surface parameters. The NN algorithm is calibrated on observations from the SMAP radiometer and radar as well as surface soil moisture fields from the MERRA-2 reanalysis. To highlight different physical aspects of the satellite signals and to maximize the soil moisture information, different preprocessing techniques of the SMAP data are investigated. These include an analysis of radiometer polarization and diurnal indices to isolate the surface temperature contribution, as well as the radar co- and cross-polarized channels to account for vegetation effects. A major difference with respect to the official retrieval is the increased importance given to the information provided by the SMAP radar or other active sensors, utilizing not only the relative spatial structures, but also the absolute soil moisture information provided. The NN methodology combines multiple sensor observations in a data fusion approach and is thus able to fully exploit the complementarity of the information provided by the different instruments. The algorithm is used to compute global estimates of surface soil moisture and evaluated against retrieved soil moisture from SMOS as well as in situ observations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The calibration on MERRA-2 data means that the NN retrieval algorithm functions as the model operator in a data assimilation framework yielding soil moisture estimates that are very compatible with the model. This could facilitate the assimilation of SMAP observations into land surface and numerical weather prediction models.",

            "abstract": "Underground natural Gas Storage (UGS) can balance the gas demand and supply through injecting gas into or withdraw gas from the subsurface rock formation. UGS has been wildly established all over the world to face the complicated international energy system. In 2013, the Hutubi underground natural gas storage was put into production, which was one of the largest UGS in China. In the Hutubi UGS, the pressurized natural gas is injected into and extracted from an obsolete gas reservoir during summer and winter time, respectively. The repeatable in and out going high pressure gas may change the stress state and material properties of the underground rock formation, which may in turn cause surface deformation and alter the seismic hazard in this region. To understand the physical process of the periodic loading and unloading, we established a multi-disciplinary monitoring system composed of a geodetic network, a seismic network, and an active source monitoring system. The position and level of 13 spots around and above the UGS area are measured every three to six months with Global Position System (GPS) and short base-line leveling. More than 30 portable broad band three component seismic stations were deployed in study area to continuously monitor the background and possible triggered seismicity. These seismic stations together with a 12000 in3 airgun source, are also used to monitor the seismic velocity change associated with the gas injection and extraction. Preliminary results indicate that seismic velocity change correlates well with the injection pressure; seismicity decays with the lapse time after the startup of Hutubi UGS; small but detectable surface deformation associated with the gas activities is observed.",

            "abstract": "In permafrost soils, ‘excess ice’, also referred to as ground ice, exists in amounts exceeding soil porosity in forms such as ice lenses and wedges. Here, we incorporate a simple representation of excess ice in the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) to investigate how excess ice affects projected permafrost thaw and associated hydrologic responses. We initialize spatially explicit excess ice obtained from the Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground-Ice Conditions. The excess ice in the model acts to slightly reduce projected soil warming by about 0.35°C by 2100 in a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The presence of excess ice slows permafrost thaw at a given location with about a 10 year delay in permafrost thaw at 3 m depth at most high excess ice locations. The soil moisture response to excess ice melt is transient and depends largely on the timing of thaw with wetter/saturated soil moisture conditions persisting slightly longer due to delayed post-thaw drainage. Based on the model projections of excess ice melt, we can estimate spatially explicit gridcell mean surface subsidence with values ranging up to 0.5 m by 2100 depending on the initial excess ice content and the extent of melt.",

Understanding the morphodynamics and physicochemical properties of Titan’s dunes is therefore essential for a better comprehension of the climatic and geological history of the largest Saturn’s moon. We derived quantitatively surface properties (texture, composition) from the modelling of microwave backscattered signal and Monte Carlo inversion of despeckled Cassini/SAR data over the equatorial sand seas. We show that dunes and inter-dunes have significantly different physical properties. Absorption is more efficient in the dunes compared to the inter-dunes. The inter-dunes are smoother with an higher dielectric constant than the dunes. Considering the composition, the inter-dunes are in between the dunes and the bright inselbergs, suggesting the presence of a shallow layer of sediment in between the dunes. Additionally potential secondary bedforms may have been detected. Implications for dune morphodynamics, sediment inventory and climatic conditions occurring on Titan will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Large-area crop yield models (LACMs) are commonly employed to address climate-driven changes in crop yield and inform policy makers concerned with climate change adaptation. Production efficiency models (PEMs), a class of LACMs that rely on the conservative response of carbon assimilation to incoming solar radiation absorbed by a crop contingent on environmental conditions, have increasingly been used over large areas with remote sensing spectral information to improve the spatial resolution of crop yield estimates and address important data gaps. Here, we present a new PEM that combines model principles from the remote sensing-based crop yield and evapotranspiration (ET) model literature. One of the major limitations of PEMs is that they are evaluated using data restricted in both space and time. To overcome this obstacle, we first validated the model using 2009-2014 eddy covariance flux tower Gross Primary Production data in a rice field in the Central Valley of California- a critical agro-ecosystem of the United States. This evaluation yielded a Willmot's D and mean absolute error of 0.81 and 5.24 g CO2/d, respectively, using CO2, leaf area, temperature, and moisture constraints from the MOD16 ET model, Priestley-Taylor ET model, and the Global Production Efficiency Model (GLOPEM). A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the model was most sensitive to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) input, followed by Photosynthetically Active Radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature. The model will now be evaluated using 30 x 30m (Landsat resolution) biomass transects developed in 2011 and 2012 from spectroradiometric and other non-destructive in situ metrics for several cotton, maize, and rice fields across the Central Valley. Finally, the model will be driven by Daymet and MODIS data over the entire State of California and compared with county-level crop yield statistics. It is anticipated that the new model will facilitate agro-climatic decision-making in various regions across the globe and with different remote sensing inputs, given its interpretability, low data requirement, flexibility, and high correlation with in situ data.",

            "abstract": "Dehumidification of Iberia by enhanced summer upwelling\nMiranda PMA, Costa V, Semedo A\nIDL, Faculdade de Ciências, University of Lisbon\nA 24-year simulation of the recent Iberian climate, using the WRF model at 9km resolution forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis (1989-2012), is analysed for the decadal evolution of the upwelling forcing coastal wind and for column integrated Precipitable water vapour (PWV). Results indicate that, unlike what was found by Bakun et al. (2009) for the Peruvian region, a statistically significant trend in the upwelling favourable (northerly) wind has been accompanied by a corresponding decrease in PWV, not only inland but also over the coastal waters. Such increase is consistent with a reinforced northerly coastal jet in the maritime boundary layer contributing to atmospheric Ekman pumping of dry continental air into the coastal region. Diagnostics of the prevalence of the Iberian thermal low following Hoinka and Castro (2003) also show a positive trend in its frequency during an extended summer period (April to September). These results are consistent with recent studies indicating an upward trend in the frequency of upwelling in SW Iberia (Alves and Miranda 2013), and may be relevant for climate change applications as an increase in coastal upwelling (Miranda et al 2013) may lead to substantial regional impacts in the subtropics.\nAknowledgements: Study supported by FCT Grant RECI/GEO-MET/0380/2012\nAlves JMR, Miranda PMA (2013) Variability of Iberian upwelling implied by ERA-40 and ERA-Interim reanalyses, Tellus A 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v65i0.19245.\nBakun et al (2010) Greenhouse gas, upwelling-favorable winds, and the future of coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems, Global Change Biology, doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02094.x\nHoinka KP, Castro M (2003) The Iberian Peninsula thermal low.

            "abstract": "In this talk, we will present results from observational analyses and model experiments to show that a significant climate shift occurred across a broad region of the Pacific in the early 1990s and that this climate shift is related to a phase change in the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). A strong piece of evidence for this climate shift is the change of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from the traditional Eastern Pacific (EP) type to a Central Pacific (CP) type after the early 1990s. The chain of inter-basin interaction processes that enable the AMO to exert an impact on the ENSO type will be described. The changing ENSO type also caused the ENSO influences on the Southern Hemisphere circulation to change significantly. A clear early-1990s climate shift is thus also found in ENSO’s relations with two major modes of Southern Hemisphere variability: the Southern Annual Mode (SAM) and the Pacific–South American (PSA) pattern. Additional evidence of the early-1990s climate shift can also be found in other phenomena, including drought patterns in China and the variability in the subtropical high in the Northwestern Pacific.",

            "abstract": "The triangular Ilan Plain in northern Taiwan has well-preserved sedimentary records which provide opportunities for understanding the subsidence and sedimentary processes at the southernmost tip of the backarc-opening Okinawa Trough. To better examine the deposition and tectonic history of the Ilan Plain, we analyzed data from 13 boreholes and used 14C dates to reconstruct basin sedimentary layers during the Holocene time. The borehole depths and their correspondent 14C ages are used to reconstruct the overall age models in the Ilan Plain. The sedimentation rates from the borehole locations vary significantly from 0.5 to 2.0 cm/yr. Age models were fitted using quadratic equations instead of linear equations. The linear age models, although commonly used by previous studies, may not be desirable because most age distributions show decreasing sedimentation rates, particularly after 6 ka BP. Six boreholes show very good fit using quadratic equations in the age models and five boreholes, mostly located along the coastal areas, show relatively linear relations. Two other boreholes do not have enough 14C dates and the reconstructed age models are less reliable in the two locations. Contour maps of the apparent sedimentation rates every thousand years are derived from the interpolated apparent sedimentation rates through the quadratic age models. Based on our 3D reconstruction of age models, the pattern of sedimentary layers in the Ilan Plain can be explained by the seaward-dipping basin shape and the propagation of sediment fronts during the Holocene time. The analyzed sedimentation pattern does not prefer noticeably localized faults or large estimates of tectonic subsidence rates in the backarc-opening environment.",

We derive estimates of actual evapotranspiration through a probabilistic Budyko framework which further allows us to obtain uncertainty bounds on surface water availability.

            "abstract": "The form of the bed at the grounding line of a glacier and the character of the underlying rock can be critical to the stability of the glacier. Aerogravity measurements offer a unique insight in to the character of the grounding line environment. By combining depth measurements from further onshore radar and geological information from magnetic surveys, gravity-based models can reveal both the depth and slope of the bed at the grounding line. Where bed elevation is known at the grounding line, gravity models can show the density structure of the underlying rock.\nOperation IceBridge has flown coincident radar, lidar, photography, gravity and magnetic airborne surveys along fjords and over ice shelves in both Greenland and Antarctica. Aerogravity measurements have been used extensively to model the bathymetry of the sea floor in front of the grounding line, and to identify the depth of the grounding line in areas where radar measurements have proven challenging.\nThese models have also been used to reveal the range of conditions at present day grounding lines, as well as those experienced in the past and predicted for future grounding line positions. In some regions, we have identified low-density sediment accumulations, at both present day grounding lines and within fjords, that we interpret to be terminal moraines deposited by the glacier itself during hiatuses in retreat. In other regions, we find that the present day grounding line is stalled on a ridge of high-density rock. Ridges such as these remain in the same position through many cycles of advance and retreat of the glacier.\nOur synthesis of gravity data from a wide range of glacial environments can be used to identify likely drivers of change at the grounding line, whether this is the depth, the slope, or the geological character of the glacier bed.",

            "abstract": "Measurements near 1AU of the bulk and compositional properties of the interplanetary plasma point to the existence of two solar winds that can be classified by their speeds, V, the fast (V>400 km s-1) and slow winds (V<400 km s-1). The slow solar wind is seldom observed slower than 300 km s-1 at 1 AU. We show that, closer to the Sun, there is a big amount of solar wind slower than 300 km s-1, hereafter very slow solar wind (VSSW). It is mostly detected inside 0.7 AU by the HELIOS spacecraft during solar maximum (1979-1980). The closer to the Sun the slower it can be observed, reaching velocities of 200 kms-1 near 0.3 AU. This very slow wind usually contains the very dense heliospheric plasma sheet as well as the heliospheric current sheet. The very low speeds disappear by 1AU likely due to the interaction with the faster plasma. Solar Probe Plus will measure in-situ how low in the inner Heliosphere this interaction starts and whether even lower velocities are observed inside 0.3 AU.\nThe VSSW has higher density and lower temperature than regular slow solar wind, qualitatively extending the known scaling laws for the solar wind over 300 km s-1(Lopez & Freeman, 1986) (Hundhausen, Bame, Asbridge, & Sydoriak, 1970). Like the rest of the slow solar wind, the helium abundance of the VSSW increase with solar activity, approaching to the fast wind composition at solar maximum. Combining a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) to a ballistic backmapping, we relate the ins-situ measurements to the solar surface. We compute the proton density flux just above the photosphere and find much higher fluxes in the VSSW than in the faster winds at solar maximum. Based on this, we propose a likely mechanism for the solar cycle variability of the helium abundance of the VSSW and slow solar wind, which will be tested by combining Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus measurements of the VSSW with high resolution and high cadence Carrington maps.\nThis work was funded by the EU FP7 HELCATS project.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric conditions typical of wintertime, such as lower boundary layer heights and reduced turbulent mixing, provide a unique environment for anthropogenic pollutants to accumulate and react. Wintertime enhancements in water vapor (H2O) have been observed in urban areas, and are thought to result from fossil fuel combustion and urban heat island-induced evaporation. The contribution of urban-derived water vapor to the atmosphere has the potential to locally influence atmospheric chemistry and weather for the urban area and surrounding region due to interactions between H2O and other chemical species, aerosols, and clouds.\nAirborne observations of urban-derived H2O, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, and aerosols were conducted from Purdue University’s Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR) and the University of Maryland’s (UMD) Twin Cessna research aircraft during the winter of 2015. Measurements were conducted as part of the collaborative airborne campaign, Wintertime INvestigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER), which investigated seasonal trends in anthropogenic emissions and reactivity in the Northeastern United States. ALAR and the UMD aircraft participated in mass balance experiments around Washington D.C.-Baltimore to determine total city emission rates of H2O and other greenhouse gases.\nAverage enhancements in H2O mixing ratio of 0.048%, and up to 0.13%, were observed downwind of the urban centers on ten research flights. In some cases, downwind H2O concentrations clearly track CO2 and NO2 enhancements, suggesting a strong combustion signal. Analysis of Purdue and UMD data collected during the WINTER campaign shows an average urban-derived H2O contribution of 5.3%, and as much as 13%, to the local boundary layer from ten research flights flown in February and March of 2015. In this paper, we discuss the potential chemical and physical implications of these results.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of seismic tomography reveals two large low shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) near the core-mantle boundary. Mantle circulation models can generate similar structures to those seen by seismic tomography, and efforts have been made to understand how these structures have evolved through time. These models solve the equations for the conservation of mass, energy and momentum together with a surface boundary condition that assimilates surface plate motion history and an initial condition for the internal structure some time in the past. Since the initial condition is unknown for the Earth, our models inherently contain some error. There is however, an abundance of data available to us from observations from seismic tomography. By employing the full adjoint method for mantle convection we can constrain the unknown mantle flow back in time using the data available to us, providing better estimates of the internal state of the mantle earlier in geological history.\nWith our forward-adjoint mantle model, together with a 200Myr plate motion history model and a global seismic tomography model, we will investigate how varying the mantle's parameters effects the stability and evolution of these structures over recent Earth history.",

Through this specific peatland hydrology, the description of the water table changes as been improved. This leads to a better estimation of methane production, oxidation and methane emission from peatlands. These developments are then used to evaluate present and future methane emission from northern peatlands, and to quantify the relative contribution of the three main processes of emission: plants, bubbling and diffusion.\nIn this work, we present the results on inter-annual and decadal variation of actual northern peatland emissions at global scale. We further analyze future projections of methane emissions from peatlands depending on the future hydrological profiles in different climate change scenarios.

Definition of the origin of Deccan magmatism and of its environmental impact relies on precise and accurate geochronological analyses. We present new 40Ar/39Ar ages from the northern sector of the province. In this area, tholeiitic and alkaline rocks were contemporaneously emplaced at 66.60±0.35 to 65.25±0.29 Ma in the Phenai Mata area, while rocks from Rajpipla and Mt. Pavagadh yielded ages ranging from 66.40±2.80 to 64.90±0.80 Ma. Indistinguishable ages for alkaline and tholeiitic magmatism, coupled with distinct major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions suggest that distinct mantle sources, necessary for the two magmatic series were synchronously active.\nThe new ages are compared with previous ages, which were carefully screened and filtered and then recalculated in order to be comparable. The entire data set of geochronological data does not support a time-related migration of the magmatism related to the northward Indian Plate movement relative to the Reunion mantle plume. The main phase of magmatism, including the newly dated rocks from the Northern Deccan occurred across the K-Pg boundary, confirming a causal link between the emplacement of the province and the K-Pg mass extinction.",

            "abstract": "The West Coast of North America is frequently impacted by atmospheric rivers (ARs), regions of intense horizontal water vapor transport that often produce heavy rain, flooding, and landslides when they interact with near-coastal mountains. Recently, studies have shown that ARs penetrate farther inland on many occasions, with indications that the vertical distribution of vapor transport within the ARs may play a key role in this penetration (Alexander et al. 2015; Rutz et al. 2015). We hypothesize that the amount of near-coastal precipitation and the likelihood of AR penetration farther inland may be inversely linked by vertical distributions of vapor fluxes before, during, and after landfall.\nTo explore whether differing vertical distributions of transport explain differing precipitation and penetration outcomes, we compare two landfalling ARs that had very similar spatial extents and rates of vertically integrated (total) vapor transport, but which nonetheless produced very different amounts of precipitation over northern California. The vertical distribution of water vapor flux, specific humidity, and wind speed during these two ARs are examined along several transects using cross-sectional analyses of the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis with a horizontal resolution of ~0.5° (~63 km) and a sigma-pressure hybrid coordinate at 64 vertical levels. In addition, we pursue similar analyses of forecasts from the NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System GEFS to assess whether numerical weather prediction models accurately represent these distributions. Finally, we calculate backward trajectories from within each AR to examine whether or not the origins of their respective air parcels play a role in the resulting vertical distribution of water vapor flux.\nThe results have major implications for two problems in weather prediction: (1) the near-coastal precipitation associated with landfalling ARs and (2) the likelihood of AR penetration farther inland.",

            "abstract": "The concept of field capacity as soil hydraulic parameter is widely used in many hydrological applications. Althought its recurring usage, its definition is not univocal. Traditionally, field capacity has been related to the amount of water that remains in the soil after the excess water has drained away and the water downward movement experiences a significant decresase. Quantifying the drainage of excess of water may be vague and several definitions, often subjective, have been proposed. These definitions are based on fixed thresholds either of time, pressure, or flux to which the field capacity condition is associated. The flux-based definition identifies the field capacity as the soil moisture value corresponding to an arbitrary fixed threshold of free drainage flux. Recently, many works have investigated the flux-based definition by varying either the drainage threshold, the geometry setting and mainly the description of the drainage flux. Most of these methods are based on the simulation of the flux through a porous medium by using the Darcy’s law or Richard’s equation.\nUsing the above-mentioned flux-based definition, in this work we propose an alternative analytical approach for deriving the field capacity based on a bundle-of-tubes model. The pore space of a porous medium is conceptualized as a bundle of capillary tubes of given length of different radii, derived from a known distribution. The drainage from a single capillary tube is given by the analytical solution of the differential equation describing the water height evolution within the capillary tube. This equation is based on the Poiseuille’s law and describes the drainage flux with time as a function of tube radius. The drainage process is then integrated for any portion of soil taking into account the tube radius distribution which in turns depends on the soil type. This methodology allows to analytically derive the dynamics of drainage water flux for any soil type and consequently to define the soil field capacity as the latter reachs a given threshold value. The theoretical model also accounts for the tortuosity which characterizes the water pathways in real soils, but neglects the voids mutual interconnections.",

            "abstract": "Whistler-mode chorus emissions are electromagnetic plasma waves commonly observed in planetary magnetospheres. In the Earth's inner magnetosphere, chorus emissions are observed mostly on the dawn side and are enhanced during geomagnetically disturbed periods. Chorus emissions appear in the typical frequency range from 0.2 to 0.8 fce0 with a gap at the half fce0, where fce0 represents the electron gyrofrequency at the magnetic equator. Recent in situ observation in the magnetosphere revealed the presence of whistler-mode hiss-like emissions, whose wave amplitude is comparable to those of chorus emissions. By a series of electron hybrid simulations, we study dependencies of the generation process of whistler-mode chorus and hiss-like emissions on temperature anisotropy of energetic electrons. The generation process of chorus has been reproduced in electron hybrid simulations and has been explained by the nonlinear wave growth theory [see review by Omura et al., 2012]. The generation mechanism of hiss-like emissions is also explained by the nonlinear wave growth theory and has been reproduced by simulations [Katoh and Omura, 2013]. In the present study, by an improved electron hybrid code with OhHelp library [Nakashima et al., 2009], we conduct a series of electron hybrid simulations for different temperature anisotropy (AT) of the initial velocity distribution function of energetic electrons. We vary AT in the range from 3 to 9 with changing the number density of energetic electrons (Nh) so as to study whether distinct rising-tone chorus emissions are reproduced or not in the assumed initial condition. Simulation results reveal that Nh required for the chorus generation decreases as AT of energetic electrons increases and that reproduced spectra becomes hiss-like for large Nh cases. These simulation results clarify the validity of the nonlinear wave growth theory and suggest that the nonlinear wave-particle interactions play crucial roles in the generation process of whistler-mode chorus and hiss-like emissions in the magnetosphere.",

The model provided reasonable estimates of observed stream temperature at three test catchments. We used the model to simulate winter stream temperature for virtual catchments located at different elevations within the rain-on-snow zone. The modelling exercise examined stream temperature response associated with interactions between elevation, snow regime, and changes in air temperature. Modelling results highlight that the sensitivity of winter stream temperature response to changes in climate may be dependent on catchment elevation and landscape position.",

            "abstract": "Building on a long legacy of hydrogeological investigations at the Savannah River Site in the Sandhills of the Upper Coastal Plain in South Carolina, we began in 2005 a headwater-scale investigation of hillslope flow pathways, streamflow sources, and water quality responses to intensive woody biomass production. The landscape is characterized by blackwater streams flowing slowly through wide flat stream valleys, deep unconsolidated layers of sands and clays, a regional clay layer beneath Fourmile Creek that defines the lower boundary of the surficial aquifer, rolling topography with steeper slopes on the valley margins and gentle slopes elsewhere, and a sandy clay loam argillic layer within 0.2 to 1.5m from the surface. Most water leaves headwater basins by groundwater flow, appearing as streamflow far downstream. Only at scales larger than 50 km2 does average streamflow match expectations from water balances. This raises the question, what constitutes the contributing area for headwater streams in porous landscapes? Perching and interflow generation over the argillic horizon is common, but leakage through clay is rapid relative to interflow travel times, so interflow serves to shift the point of percolation downslope from the point of infiltration. Only interflow from the valley-adjacent slopes can contribute to stormflow responses. Our interflow interception trenches and maximum rise piezometer networks reveal high heterogeneity in subsurface flow paths at multiple spatial scales. Streamwater has isotopic and chemical characteristics similar to deep groundwater, but we cannot easily determine the source area for groundwater reaching the first order streams. Our observations suggest that one’s view of hillslope and catchment flow processes depends on the scale, number, and frequency of observations of state variables and outputs. In some cases, less frequent or less numerous observations of fewer tracers would have yielded different inferences. The data also suggest that each hillslope encompasses an ensemble of thresholds and flow paths that vary with moisture content over space and time.",

            "abstract": "The Plio-Quaternary magmatism in the Tyrrhenian Sea area exhibits wide compositional variations, which cover almost entirely those observed for volcanic rocks worldwide. Some volcanoes (Etna, Iblei, Sardinia, etc.) range from tholeiitic to Na-alkaline, and display elemental and isotope signatures typical of FOZO and EM-1 ocean-island basalts (OIB). Other volcanoes (Aeolian Arc, Italian peninsula) range from calc-alkaline–shoshonitic to K-alkaline, exhibit typical ‘subduction-related’ trace element signatures (low Ta–Nb, high Rb–Cs–REE), and show a large range of radiogenic isotope ratios, from mantle-like in the Aeolian Arc to crustal-like in central Italy. Geochemical data suggest that OIB-type magmatism originated in lithosphere–sthenosphere sources that were unaffected by recent subduction. In contrast, subduction-related magmas come from mantle sources that underwent Eocene to present mixing with various amounts and types of subducted crustal components. Fluxing of the mantle wedge by water-rich fluids from a mid-ocean ridge basalt-type slab ± sediments occurred in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, whereas interaction between peridotite and various types of sediments occurred in central Italy. These contrasting styles of mantle contaminations relate to the nature (oceanic or continental) of the foreland, slab geometry and pre-metasomatic mantle compositions, which vary greatly along the Apennine arc and are the reason for the formation of the wide variety of orogenic magmas in Italy.",

Its spatiotemporal distribution and generation mechanism are presently the object of active research. We here give the first report on the shock-induced disappearance of plasmaspheric hiss observed by the Van Allen Probes on 8 October 2013. This special event exhibits the dramatic variability of plasmaspheric hiss and provides a good opportunity to test its generation mechanisms. The origination of plasmaspheric hiss from plasmatrough chorus is suggested to be an appropriate prerequisite to explain this event. The shock increased the suprathermal electron fluxes, and then the enhanced Landau damping promptly prevented chorus waves from entering the plasmasphere. Subsequently, the shrinking magnetopause removed the source electrons for chorus, contributing significantly to the several-hours-long disappearance of plasmaspheric hiss.",

            "abstract": "Quasi-periodic (QP) emissions are whistler mode electromagnetic waves which are observed in the inner magnetosphere, either inside the plasmasphere or near the plasmapause. They exhibit a periodic time modulation of the wave intensity with the modulation periods from several seconds to minutes. The analysis of wave propagation properties of nearly 200 QP events measured by the low-altitude DEMETER spacecraft (altitude 700 km) shows that QP emissions generally propagate nearly field-aligned at larger geomagnetic latitudes (> 55 degrees) and they become more oblique at mid-latitudes (latitudes of 45 degrees). However, we have observed several QP events with unexpected variations of both wave and Poynting vectors directions over a short time/spatial interval at larger latitudes. These seem to contradict the general statistical results. We perform a detailed analysis of three such events. All these events were observed during quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp < 2). A ray-tracing calculation is used to determine the wave paths and the locations of the generation regions. We also discuss the influence of the plasmapause on the wave propagation.",

Trees transport water through the roots and stem up to the canopy for transpiration. This process slows down when soil moisture in the root zone decreases. An accelerometer was mounted just below the crown of a plane (Platanus x hispanica) tree in Delft, the Netherlands, to measure the displacement and acceleration in three dimensions. Using spectral analysis, a diurnal pattern in the governing frequencies was found. Additional meteorological, sap flow, and canopy interception measurements are used to analyze the signal, and explain the variations in the governing frequencies. The goal of this study is to quantify the mass changes in a tree using 3D acceleration data, and separate this into contributions from interception, and changes in tree water content.

Current spatial missions allow to estimate LAI at global scale, however product validation is needed for its reliable use.\nIn this paper, a methodology is described to derive reference LAI maps from ground-based measurements at the JECAM site of Capitanata using Landsat 8 imagery as auxiliary information and to estimate prediction uncertainty.\nLAI was measured with LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-COR) in 30 experimental sampling units (ESU) of 10 m by 10 m size within a polygon of about 3 km by 3 km size. Two surveys were carried out in 2014: on March 18-20 and on May 9-13.\nTo integrate secondary finer-resolution information in primary sparse variable modelling, multicollocated cokriging was used, where the secondary variable for cokriging estimate is used at the target location and also at all the locations where the primary variable is defined within the neighbourhood of interpolation. To assess prediction uncertainty, Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated and in order to make the values comparable the relative CI was calculated by dividing by the corresponding LAI estimation and assumed as a quality index of LAI product.\nLAI maps were produced for the two selected dates and from a comparison between radiometric and estimated LAI maps, it results a general high consistency with Landsat 8 imagery.\nThe quality maps derived from LAI estimator for the two dates with overlaid the locations of the sample data points show that to the pixels located near the samples are attributed a quality index of about 40-50% but, as the distance increases, the uncertainty becomes too large. The poor results are probably due to the too coarse sampling, with large areas without any ground-truth data of LAI.",

            "abstract": "The years since the devastating Banda Aceh Earthquake of December, 2004 have repeatedly inflicted the terrible loss of life and economic disruption from large earthquakes and resulting tsunamis upon Indo-Pacific coastal populations. The hardest hit populations are those closest to the earthquake source, a scenario for which most Indo-Pacific nations lack an adequate early warning system.\nFollowing the Banda Aceh Earthquake, GNSS based techniques were developed to provide accurate, timely, estimates of ground displacements, the modeling and monitoring of tsunami propagation. Major investments are also being made to deploy and upgrade existing GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo, GZSS, and IRNSS) by the end of this decade. There have also been significant investments in multi-GNSS ground networks and analysis centers that often provide measurements in real time. These multi-national investments now present the possibility for significant improvements to the Indo-Pacific region’s tsunami warning.\nThe development of GNSS based tsunami warning integrated with existing seismic based tsunami warning systems will provide a robust, accurate, timely, and cost effective network to provide effective warning for the Indo-Pacific coastal communities. The UN General Assembly has called for the sharing of geodetic data for the mitigation of natural hazards while the IUGG and IGS recommend the implementation of a GNSS based augmentation to the Tsunami Early Warning System. The same GNSS ground networks and constellations that support the Tsunami Early Warning network also provide Positioning, Navigation, and Timing and other benefits to these communities thereby insuring a sustainable and reliable capability.",

            "abstract": "Accurate source locations of earthquakes and other seismic events are fundamental in seismology. The location accuracy is limited by several factors, including velocity models, which are often poorly known. In contrast, surface topography, the largest velocity contrast in the Earth, is often precisely mapped at the seismic wavelength (> 100 m). In this study, we explore the use of P-coda waves generated by scattering at surface topography to obtain high-resolution locations of near-surface seismic events. The Pacific Northwest region is chosen as an example. The grid search method is combined with the 3D strain Green's tensor database type method to improve the search efficiency as well as the quality of hypocenter solution. The strain Green's tensor is calculated by the 3D collocated-grid finite difference method on curvilinear grids. Solutions in the search volume are then obtained based on the least-square misfit between the 'observed' and predicted P and P-coda waves. A 95% confidence interval of the solution is also provided as a posterior error estimation. We find that the scattered waves are mainly due to topography in comparison with random velocity heterogeneity characterized by the von Kάrmάn-type power spectral density function. When only P wave data is used, the 'best' solution is offset from the real source location mostly in the vertical direction. The incorporation of P coda significantly improves solution accuracy and reduces its uncertainty. The solution remains robust with a range of random noises in data, un-modeled random velocity heterogeneities, and uncertainties in moment tensors that we tested.",

The existence of an ice cap and several streams channeling in some main rivers increase the risk of lahars and mudflows in case of unrest, as occurred during the November 1985 eruption, which caused 20,000 casualties. The involvement of the local hydrothermal system has also produced in the past phreatic and phreatomagmatic activity, as in 1985 and 1989. After more than 7 years of relative stability, since 2010, the still ongoing phase of unrest has produced two small eruption in 2012, and still maintains in high levels of seismicity and SO2 degassing.\nIn October 2013, a sampling campaign has been performed on thermal springs and streamwater, located at 2600-5000 m asl, analyzed for water chemistry and stable isotopes. By applying a model of steam-heating, based on mass and enthalpy balances, we have estimated the mass rate of steam discharging in the different steam-heated springs.\nThe composition of the hottest thermal spring (Botero Londoño) is probably representative of a marginal part of the hydrothermal system, having a temperature of 250°C and low salinity (Cl ~1500 mg/l), which suggest a chiefly meteoric origin, as also confirmed by the isotope composition retrieved for the hydrothermal water.\nThe vapour discharged at the steam vent \"Nereidas\" (3600 m asl) is hypothesised to be separated from a high-temperature hyrothermal system. Based on its composition and on literature data on fluid inclusions, we have retrieved the P-T-X conditions of the deep hydrothermal system, as well as its pH and fO2. The vapour feeding Nereidas would separate from a byphasic hydrothermal system characterised by the follow parameters:\nt= 315°C, P=19 MPa, NaCl= 15 %, CO2 = 9%, and similar proportion between liquid and vapour. Considering also the equilibria involving S-bearing gases and HCl, we obtain pH=2, fO2 fixed by FeO-Fe2O3 buffer, and [Cl]=12000 mg/l. Changes in the magmatic input into the hydrothermal system could modify its degree of vaporization and/or P-T-X conditions, thus inducing corresponding variations in vapour discharges and thermal waters. These findings, paralleled by contemporary measurements of water flow rates, could give significant clues on risk evaluation at NdR.",

            "abstract": "Since paleomagnetic studies have focused on Late Precambrian-Early Paleozoic geodynamics of the Siberian platform, apparently \nirreconcilable paleomagnetic poles have been obtained. We will first report on recent paleomagnetic results dated to the Late Ediacaran-Nemakit Daldynian (latemost Precambrian-Lowermost Cambrian) and Tommotian-Atdabanian (Lower Cambrian) periods obtained from the southwestern and southeastern margins of the Siberian platform. Whereas the poles of the older time interval lie close to Madagascar, Tommotian-Atdabanian poles are lying to the south of Australia, as other Cambrian poles previously obtained by Khramov and co-authors. Such a large angular difference in pole position could be explained either by True Polar Wander or by the occurrence of abnormal geomagnetic field behavior around the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. Furthermore, a 60-m thick sequence of red siltstones and sandstones of the Ediacaran Lopata Formation, that crops out along the Teya river in the Yenisey Ridge region (Western margin of the Siberian platform), was sampled for magnetostratigraphy. Rock magnetic analyses and thermal demagnetization reveal a magnetization dominantly carried by hematite, with the coexistence of antiparallel components of magnetization in some samples. The magnetization isolated over the highest unblocking temperatures is regarded as the characteristic component. It defines numerous magnetic polarity intervals with antipodal directions. According to reasonable sedimentation rates expected for the lithology of the Lopata Formation, this high number of magnetozones most probably indicates the occurrence of an extremely high magnetic reversal frequency during at least a part of the Ediacaran. This result confirms other magnetostratigraphic data previously obtained in North-Western Russia and Urals. Altogether, the paleomagnetic and magnetostratigraphic results provide evidence supporting the unusual geomagnetic field behavior around the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary.",

In this paper, we explore whether there is a real increase in variability, whether the community perceives that recent extreme events are outside the experience which shapes their responses to ‘normal’ levels of variability, and what science-based policy could contribute to greater local resilience. Hydrological analyses suggest that variability is indeed increasing, in line with expectations from future climate change. However, current measures of hydrological regimes do not predict years with social hardship very well. Interviewees in two regions are able to express their strategies for dealing with ‘normal’ variability very well, but also identify ways in which abnormal years exceed their ability to cope. Current Civil Defense arrangements struggle to deliver emergency assistance in a sufficiently timely and locally appropriate fashion. Combining these insights in the context of social-ecological change, we suggest how better integration of science, policy and local knowledge could improve resilience to future trends, and identify some contributions science could make into such an arrangement.",

            "abstract": "Intermittent rivers are those that cease to flow at some point(s) in space and time along their course and are present in all climates and terrestrial biomes. The prevalence of drying is increasing, even in temperate biomes that we typically do not associate with river drying or dry climates. There have been several techniques employed to characterize patterns of intermittency but field mapping and use of electrical resistivity (ER) sensors are the most common. Field mapping has long been used to study intermittency, but this method is limited by its inability to capture the rapidly changing configuration of intermittent streams that often occur during wetting and drying events. ER sensors enable researchers to remotely record channel-water presence at fine spatiotemporal scales which will better capture seasonal dynamics in transient lotic systems. Here, we compare field mapping and ER sensor recordings of stream intermittency for 10 forested headwater streams in northeastern Ohio. Field mapping occurred approximately biweekly while the ER sensors recorded at 30-minute intervals from April through November 2014. Although ER sensors offer many advantages to stream mapping, our study revealed several limitations of ER sensors including requiring re-securing after flows moved sensors, burial in sediment that results them in recording subsurface water, and the small spatial scale the sensors are representative of. Nevertheless, ER sensors provide a low cost, high performance, and method that requires minimal data interpretation to monitor the presence and absence of water in channels at a specific location. The latest generation of ER sensors also record temperature, which can help in differentiate standing and flowing water. Aspects other than timing, duration, and frequency of flow such as the resumption (advancing) and recession (retreating) rates or magnitudes can be characterized with ER sensor arrays.",

            "abstract": "The long-term average of the controlling parameter of catchment water balance has been widely reported; however, their inter-annual variability has rarely been quantified. Besides precipitation (P) and potential evaporation(ET0), the surface condition and seasonality of climate have great impacts on inter-annual variability of catchment water balance, which can be reflected by the parameter w (in terms of Fu’s equation). Two watersheds on the Loess Plateau were thus chosen to quantify their relationships. To diminish the impacts of catchment water storage on water balance, the annual water balance was firstly estimated for each water year from 1981 to 2012. Then, the annual maximum vegetation coverage (M) based on NDVI and the variation coefficient (σ) of daily wetness index (P/ET0) were used to respectively present the surface condition and the seasonal variations in the coupled water and energy, and further discuss their relationships with w. Results showed that w correlated well with M and σ, then a semi-empirical formula was developed to calculate the key parameter w on annual scale (w=1+5.99×M1.01×exp (-0.072σ), R2=0.60). The equation was further validated in some other watersheds on the Loess Plateau and proved to be superior in estimating actual evaporation (ET). Finally, the Fu’s equation and the semi-empirical formula for w were combined to quantify the contributions of changes in climate (P, ET0 and σ) and surface condition (M) to ET variations. Results showed that σ and M accounted for 5.8% and -3.2% of the ET decrease for the period of 1981-1995, respectively; during 1996-2012, the contribution of σ to ET changes decreased while that of M increased by 18.9%, indicating the impacts of surface condition on catchment water balance were strengthened.",

The concept of deep borehole disposal for radioactive waste has some advantages over mined repositories, including incremental construction and loading, the enhanced natural barriers provided by deep continental crystalline basement, and reduced site characterization. Site characterization efforts need to determine an eligible site that does not have the following disqualifying characteristics: greater than 2 km to crystalline basement, upward vertical fluid potential gradients, presence of economically exploitable natural resources, presence of high permeability connection to the shallow subsurface, and significant probability of future seismic or volcanic activity. Site characterization activities for the DBFT will include geomechanical (i.e., rock in situ stress state, and fluid pressure), geological (i.e., rock and fracture infill lithology), hydrological (i.e., quantity of fluid, fluid convection properties, and solute transport mechanisms), and geochemical (i.e., rock-water interaction and natural tracers) aspects. Both direct (i.e., sampling and in situ testing) and indirect (i.e., borehole geophysical) methods are planned for efficient and effective characterization of these site aspects and physical processes. Borehole-based characterization will be used to determine the variability of system state (i.e., stress, pressure, temperature, and chemistry) with depth, and interpretation of material and system parameters relevant to numerical site simulation.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water are unequally partitioned during phase changes, with environmental conditions controlling the degree of partitioning. As a result, the isotopic composition of water reflects the thermodynamic history of water parcels in the water cycle. Recent advances in cavity ringdown spectrometry allow for the continuous measurement of water vapor isotope compositions, and provide insight into the processes influencing the concentration of near-surface water vapor at high resolution.\nWe used stable water isotopes to investigate the processes controlling water vapor cycling in a deep mountain valley in northwestern Wyoming. A Picarro L2120-i Cavity Ring-Down spectrometer was deployed to measure the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor at the University of Michigan Camp Davis Field Station near Jackson, WY for three consecutive summers (2012-2014) and during winter 2013. We also constructed a network of Granier-style sap flux probes to estimate the local transpiration flux from regionally dominant tree species in July 2014. A prominent diurnal cycle was observed during the summer that was mostly absent in the winter. Summer specific humidity, δD, δ18O, and sap flux all reach daily maximum values in the mid-to-late morning that we associate with the onset of transpiration. The mountain valley is capped by an inversion, which limits atmospheric mixing during the morning. After the breakup of the inversion, the atmospheric boundary layer develops quickly and results in decreases in near-surface specific humidity and δ18O. δD appears to be less affected following the inversion breakup, resulting in a strong diurnal cycle in d-excess. Specific humidity, δD, and δ18O all return to their morning values rapidly near sunset, marking the cessation of mixing and atmospheric stratification. This absence of this diurnal cycle in the winter is consistent with reduced transpiration and atmospheric mixing anticipated for the winter season. These measurements help to improve our understanding of water transport processes in areas with high and heterogenous topography, and may help improve interpretations of paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry records in high elevation regions.",

            "abstract": "Land conversion from natural surfaces to artificial urban structures has led to the phenomenon of urban heat island (UHI). The intensity of UHI is thought to be controlled primarily by biophysical factors such as changes in albedo, aerodynamic resistance and evapotranspiration, while influences of biogeochemical factors such as aerosol pollution have long been ignored. We hypothesize that increased downward longwave radiation associated with anthropogenic aerosols in urban air will exacerbate nighttime UHI intensity. Here we tested this hypothesis by using the MODIS satellite land surface temperature product and the Community Land Model (CLM) for 39 cities in China. Our results showed that in contrast to observations in North America and elsewhere, nighttime surface UHI of these Chinese cities (3.34 K) was greater than daytime UHI (2.06 K). Variations in the nighttime UHI among the cities were positively correlated with difference in the aerosol optical depth between urban and the adjacent rural area (confidence level p < 0.01). The CLM was able to reproduce the MODIS UHI intensity in the daytime but underestimated the observed UHI intensity at night. The model performance was improved by including an aerosol-enhanced downward longwave radiation in urban land and a more realistic anthropogenic heat flux. Our study illustrates that although climate background largely determine spatial differences in the daytime UHI, in countries like China with serious air quality problems, aerosol-induced pollution plays an important role in the night-time UHI formation. Mitigation of particulate pollution therefore has the added co-benefit by reducing UHI-related heat stress on urban residents.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones exert a fundamental control on the deep carbon cycle. We reevaluated carbon inputs and outputs in convergent margins considering new estimates of C concentration in subducting mantle peridotites, carbonate solubility in aqueous fluids along subduction geotherms, melting and diapirism of carbon-bearing metasediments, and diffuse degassing from arcs. Our updated estimate of carbon inputs to the global subduction system, which includes estimates for C in altered peridotite, is 40-66 megatons carbon/year (MtC/y). We find that estimates of C lost from slabs (14-66 MtC/y) must take into account the high CaCO3 solubility in aqueous fluids, which contributes significant C that must be added to that derived from mineral decarbonation reactions. When taken together with hydrous silicate and carbonatite melts and metasediment diapirs, nearly all C can be scavenged from subducting lithosphere. The return of C to the atmosphere via arc-volcano degassing is only 18-43 MtC/y, but consideration deep volatile saturation of arc magmas, magma ponding in the middle and deep arc crust, and CO2 venting in forearcs can account for the remaining C lost from the slab. Thus, whereas previous studies concluded that about half the subducting carbon is returned to the convecting mantle, we find that relatively little carbon may be recycled. If so, substantial quantities of carbon are stored in the mantle lithosphere and crust and the carbon content of the mantle lithosphere + crust + ocean + atmosphere must be increasing, at least over the last 5-10 My. This is consistent with inferences from noble gas data. Recycled carbon in diamonds is a small fraction of the global carbon inventory.",

Hydrologic processes are inherently spatiotemporal. Extreme conditions can be identified at a certain period of time in a specific geographic region. These extreme conditions occur when the values of a hydrologic variable are record low or high, or they approach those records. The calculation of the historic probability distributions is essential to understanding when values exceed the thresholds and become extreme. A dense data model in time and space must be used to properly estimate the historic distributions. The purpose of this research is to model the time-dependent probability distributions of hydrologic variables at a national scale. These historic probability distributions are modeled daily, using 35 years of data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) Noah model, which is a land-surface model with a 1/8 degree grid and hourly values from 1979 to the present. Five hydrologic variables are selected: soil moisture, precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and temperature. The probability distributions are used to compare with the latest results from NLDAS and identify areas where extreme hydrologic conditions are present. The identification of extreme values in hydrologic variables and their inter-correlation improve the assessment and characterization of natural disasters such as floods or droughts. This information is presented through a dynamic web application that shows the latest results from NLDAS and any anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the relation between drought severity and tree growth is important to predict future growth rates as climate change effects the frequency and severity of future droughts. Two commonly used metrics of drought severity are the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). These indices are often calculated from proximal weather station data and therefore may not be very accurate at the local watershed scale. The accuracy of these commonly used measures of drought severity was compared to a recently developed, locally calibrated model of water limitation based on the difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration (ETDIFF). Relative accuracies of the drought indices were assessed on the strength of correlations with a 20-year tree-ring index chronology (1986-2006) developed from 22 loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) trees in water-limited landscape positions at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), a 41-hectare forested watershed located in north-central Georgia. We used SPI and PDSI index values from the weather station located at the Atlanta Airport, approximately 36 kilometers from PMRW. ETDIFF was calculated based on precipitation, temperature, runoff, and solar radiation data collected at PMRW. Annual index values for all three drought indices were calculated as the mean value over the growing season (May to September). All three indices had significant Pearson correlations with the tree-ring index (p = 0.044, 0.007, 0.002 for SPI, PDSI, and ETDIFF, respectively). The ETDIFF method had the strongest correlation (R2 = 0.40) compared to SPI and PDSI results (R2 = 0.19 and 0.32, respectively). Results suggest SPI and PDSI provided a general measure of drought conditions, however, the locally calibrated model of water limitation appears to measure drought severity more accurately. Future studies on the ecological effects of drought may benefit from adopting ETDIFF as a measure of drought severity.",

The specificity of the dataset is its high space-time resolution, especially concerning rainfall and the hydrological response which is particularly adapted to the highly spatially variable rainfall events that may occur in this region. This type of dataset is rare in scientific literature because of the quantity and type of sensors for meteorology and surface hydrology. Rainfall data include continuous precipitation measured by rain-gages (5 min time step for the research network of 21 rain-gages and 1h time step for the operational network of 9 rain-gages), S-band Doppler dual-polarization radar (1 km2, 5 min resolution), and disdrometers (11 sensors working at 1 min time step). During the special observation period (SOP-1) and enhanced observation period (Sep-Dec 2012, Sep-Dec 2013) of the HyMeX (Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment) project, two X-band radars provided precipitation measurements at very fine spatial and temporal scales (1 ha, 5 min). Meteorological data are taken from the operational surface weather observation stations of Meteo France at the hourly time resolution (6 stations in the region of interest). The monitoring of surface hydrology and suspended sediment is multi-scale and based on nested catchments. Three hydrometric stations measure water discharge and additional physico-chemical variables at a 2-10 min time resolution. Two experimental plots monitor overland flow and erosion at 1 min time resolution on a hillslope with vineyard. A network of 11 gauges continuously measures water level and temperature in headwater subcatchments at a time resolution of 2-5 min. A network of soil moisture sensors enable the continuous measurement of soil volumetric water content at 20 min time resolution at 9 sites.

            "abstract": "Despite the large global distribution of soluble bedrock, fluvial geomorphological studies typically regard dissolution as a negligible erosion mechanism in bedrock channels when compared to rates of mechanical erosion. Limited prior field observations have suggested that at the transition from insoluble to soluble substrate bedrock channels become wider, less steep, or both. By extending the Fastscape landscape evolution model to include dissolution as an erosion mechanism, we repeatedly produce landscapes with trunk streams consistent with field observations. However, in small tributaries, channel steepening occurs at the contact of the insoluble and soluble lithologies. Furthermore, as the main channel in a basin encounters the soluble layer, the increased erosion due to dissolution acts produces a local increase in the rate of base level lowering, resulting in steepening of channels upstream of the lithologic contact. The increased erosion at the lithological contact in the main stem also causes hillsope steepening in the soluble reaches. Independent field observations in the Buffalo National River Basin agree with the model results. Knickpoints and slot canyons are common at the lithologic contact in small tributaries, and channel widening occurs in soluble reaches in the main stem.",

Norilsk industrial region is the largest producer of nickel and palladium in the world, and Igarka and Dudingka are important ports for shipping. We constructed a spatio-temporal interpolated temperature model by including 1km MODIS LST, field-measured climate, Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), DEM, Landsat NDVI and Landsat Land Cover. Those fore-mentioned spatial data have various resolution and coverage in both time and space. We analyzed their relationships and created a monthly spatio-temporal interpolated surface temperature model at 1km resolution from 1980 to 2010. The temperature model then was used to examine the characteristic seasonal LST signatures, related to several representative assemblages of Arctic urban and industrial infrastructure in order to quantify anthropogenic influence on regional surface temperature.",

            "abstract": "High latitude peatlands constitute about 3% of the global land cover but store almost a third of the global soil carbon pool. The annual net ecosystem carbon balance at high latitude mires results from the balance between net ecosystem exchange, methane emission and stream discharge export. Understanding stream carbon export dynamics is needed to accurately predict how the carbon balance of peatlands will respond to climatic and environmental change. We use a ten year record (2004-2014) of streamflow and dissolved carbon (DOC, DIC, and CH4) measurements to assess interannual and seasonal variability in stream carbon export for a peatland catchment in northern Sweden. Mean annual total carbon export for the ten year period was 11.4 gC/m2, but individual years ranged between 6.1 and 17.2 gC/m2. DOC was the dominant form of carbon being exported, comprising 68% to 76% of total annual exports, and DIC contributed between 24% and 30%. CH4 made up less than 3% of total export. Stream carbon export and streamflow were highly synchronous. The majority of export (30% to 55% of annual totals) occurred during the spring snowmelt period. Exports during the summer and autumn were highly variable (1% to 45% and 9% to 53% of annual totals, respectively) and depended on the timing and magnitude of rain events. Winter periods were characterized by low streamflow conditions and associated low carbon export (0.6% to 10% of annual totals). These results highlight considerable interannual and seasonal variability of stream carbon export driven primarily by rain and snowmelt runoff events.",

            "abstract": "The composition of much of Earth’s lower continental crust is enigmatic. The available heat-flow and wavespeed constraints can be satisfied if lower continental crust elsewhere contains anywhere from 49 to 62 wt% SiO2 (similar to andesite and dacite), with high to moderate concentrations of K, Th and U.\nBeneath shields and platforms, Vp suggests that 20–30% of lower crust is mafic. A large fraction of this material could be denser than peridotite. In these settings the underlying upper mantle is too cold to permit development of a convective instability. High Vp lithologies in these settings may be the result of mafic underplating, or slow metamorphic growth of large proportions of garnet. Vp from lower crust of Paleozoic–Mesozoic orogens indicates a smaller amount of mafic rock and little or no material that is denser than peridotite. Beneath rifts, arcs, and volcanic plateaux and beneath continent-collision zones, ~10–20% of lower crust is mafic, and about half that is denser than peridotite. The inferred gravitational instability and high Moho temperatures suggest that the mafic lower crust in these regions may be temporary.\nDuring sediment subduction, subduction erosion, arc subduction, and continent subduction, mafic rocks become eclogite and may continue to descend into the mantle, whereas more silica-rich rocks are transformed into felsic gneisses that are less dense than peridotite but more dense than continental upper crust. These more-felsic rocks may rise buoyantly, undergo decompression melting and melt extraction, and may be relaminated to the base of the crust. As a result of this refining/differentiation process, such relatively felsic rocks could form much of lower crust.",

The data-set contains realizations of (i) errors at large spatial scales assessed individually for periods between 10 -- 30, 3 -- 10, and 1 -- 3 days, the S1 atmospheric tide, and sub-diurnal periods; (ii) errors at small spatial scales typically not covered by global models of atmosphere and ocean variability; and (iii) errors due to physical processes not represented in currently available de-aliasing products. The error magnitudes for each of the different frequency bands are derived from a small ensemble of four atmospheric and oceanic models.\nIn order to demonstrate the plausibility of the error magnitudes chosen, we perform a variance component estimation based on daily GRACE normal equations from the ITSG-Grace2014 global gravity field series recently published by the University of Graz. All 12 years of the error model are used to calculate empirical error variance-covariance matrices describing the systematic dependencies of the errors both in time and in space individually for five continental and four oceanic regions, and daily GRACE normal equations are subsequently employed to obtain pre-factors for each of those matrices. For the largest spatial scales up to d/o = 40 and periods longer than 24 h, errors prepared for the updated ESM are found to be largely consistent with noise of a similar stochastic character contained in present-day GRACE solutions. Differences and similarities identified for all of the nine regions considered will be discussed in detail during the presentation.\nDobslaw, H., I. Bergmann-Wolf, R. Dill, E. Forootan, V.

Our measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations were based on a recently developed CW-QCL absorption spectrometer to measure the concentrations of N2O and CH4 and an infrared gas analyzer to measure the concentrations of CO2 and H2O. We investigated the magnitude of trace gas emissions during a year of major disturbance (grassland restoration - including ploughing and fertilization in 2012) and the two following years representing business as usual (up to 6 harvests per year which are followed by fertilizer application, 2013 and 2014).\nWe observed large peaks of N2O (up to 50 nmol m-2 s-1) in 2012 during thawing of the soil after the winter period and after re-sowing as well as inorganic fertilizer application at the beginning of summer. N2O emissions following harvest and fertilizer application ranged between 2 and 7 nmol m-2 s-1 and background fluxes were no larger than 1 nmol m-2 s-1.\nFluxes of N2O were primarily controlled by soil water content and temperature, while management activities lead to larger variation of N2O fluxes during several days after the management event when compared to the background flux measurements. Annual flux budgets were dominated by CO2 emissions and N2O emissions contributed largely to the annual budget in 2012 but to a much lesser extend in the post-disturbance years (2013/2014). CH4 flux contribution to the annual budget was negligible.\nWe conclude that grassland restoration results in large N2O emissions, while not leading to larger N2O emissions in subsequent years. Still, such specific time periods of enhanced N2O emissions need to be considered in decadal greenhouse gas budget estimates due to the fact that a single year can offset previous carbon and nitrogen sinks.",

The ores in the Tri-State (TS) and Northern Arkansas (NA) districts, dominated by sphalerite, are mainly hosted by platform carbonate rocks and vary in age from Ordovician and Mississippian for NA and Mississippian for TS. The deposits are considered to have formed from a regional hydrothermal flow system consisting of sedimentary brines discharged from the Arkoma basin and adjacent platform during the Late Pennsylvanian to Early Permian Ouachita orogeny.\nNew MC-ICP-MS Pb isotope analyses of sphalerites are presented in order to compare and contrast the isotopic signature of ores from the NA and TS districts with those from other MVT districts from central and eastern US and trace metal sources. The Pb isotope ratios of ores from the TS District (208Pb/204Pb between 40.7443 and 41.2626; 207Pb/204Pb between 15.8633 and 15.9571; 206Pb/204Pb between 21.8373 and 22.1956) plot in an area that is superimposed on the Pb isotope field defined by samples from the Central Missouri District, suggesting similar metal sources. The sphalerites are less radiogenic than samples from the Upper Mississippi Valley District, but more radiogenic than samples from any other MVT district.\nSphalerites from the NA District have lower Pb isotope values (208Pb/204Pb between 39.4633 and 40.8863; 207Pb/204Pb between 15.8216 and 15.9176; 206Pb/204Pb between 20.2396 and 21.6438) than the TS District ores; they plot below the field defined by samples from the Illinois-Kentucky district and overlap the field defined by ores from the Southeast Missouri (Viburnum and Old Lead Belt) district, implying similar metal sources. Current data suggest that basement of Grenvillian age (1 – 1.2 by), thought to be present in Arkansas, to the south of the Viburnum Trend, may be a likely source of the radiogenic Pb component.

Deployments of wind, sand and dust sensors sophisticated enough to begin unpacking the complex relations among wind turbulence, surface roughness, sand flux and dust emission remain largely stationary. Aerial observations from satellites, planes and even UAVs help fill in, but none of these modalities offer the hope of “capturing the action” by being at the right place at the right time relative to the highly localized nature of sediment transport during wind storms.\nWe have been developing a legged robot capable of rapidly traversing desert terrain, and are now adapting it to serve as a platform for scientific instrumentation. We aim to field a semi-autonomous, reactive mobile sensory package suited to the needs of aeolian science that can address the limitations of existing alternatives. This presentation reports on early trials in the Jornada LTER and White Sands National Monument aimed at gathering measurements of airflow and rates of sand transport on a dune face, assessing the role of roughness elements such as vegetation in modifying the wind shear stresses incident on the surface, and estimating erosion susceptibility in a natural arid soil. We will solicit ideas from the audience about other potentially interesting and viable measurement targets. Future close collaboration between aeolian, cognitive and robotics scientists such as we hope to promote through this presentation may yield machines with scientifically relevant sensory suites possessing sufficient autonomy to operate in-situ at the most intense episodes of wind and sediment movement under conditions far too uncomfortable and hazardous for human presence.",

Four HFAs were selected based on the criterion that all four spacecraft observed them at the early stage when the current sheet is easily identified. Ion data were available from two spacecraft: C1 and C3. In order to calculate number densities and velocities of the solar wind beam and of the reflected beam we divided in two parts the velocity space in which measurements of the ion flux were performed: one velocity space domain in which only the solar wind beam was observed, the other velocity space domain corresponding to the remaining velocity space in which reflected beam(s) were detected. Ion parameters were calculated as moments of the ion distributions in which phase space density was assigned to respective CLUSTER (θ,φ,V) grid blocks.\nOne of interesting features present in observed crossings of HFAs is that reflected ions tend to be observed within long time interval from the side of quasi-parallel shock. The flux of these ions is increasing and their average energy is decreasing towards the HFA itself. These cases correspond to larger ratio of the reflected beam density to the solar wind beam density.\nDeceleration of the flow within HFA itself is reversely proportional to the reflected beam density, which corresponds to momentum conservation of the flux within HFA.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic glass contains both primary magmatic and secondary meteoric dissolved water, which can have distinguishable hydrogen isotopic ratios. We analyzed compositionally and globally diverse volcanic glass from recent to 640 ka for their δD (‰, VSMOW) and H2Ot (wt.%) on the TC/EA MAT 253 continuous flow system. We find that rhyolite glass is hydrated faster than basaltic glass, and in the majority of glasses an increase in age and total water content leads to a decrease in δD (‰), which is opposite the trend for magmatic degassing, while a few equatorial glasses have little change in δD (‰). To better understand these results, we imaged 6 tephra clasts ranging in age and chemical composition using BSE (by FEI SEM) down to a resolution of ~1 mm. Mafic tephra have lower vesicle number densities (N/mm2 = 25–77) than silicic tephra (736) and thicker average bubble walls (0.07 mm) than silicic tephra (0.02 mm). Lengths of water diffusion were modeled by finite difference using H2Ot concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients for diffusion of water into basalt and rhyolite glass using Zhang et al. (2007) and Ni and Zhang (2008) diffusion parameterizations extrapolated to surface temperatures. Due to the 106 times slower diffusion, water only diffused ~10-5 mm into basaltic glass and ~10 mm into rhyolitic glass after 1000 years. These hydration rates match our H2Ot wt.% values for basaltic tephra, and would cause a rhyolite glass, with an average bubble wall thickness of 0.02 mm as described above, to already be fully hydrated with ~3.0–3.5 wt.% H2Ot after ~1000 years, which is similar to what we observe. Results here are our initial steps in understanding water diffusion rates at ambient temperature in basalt and rhyolite tephra, and the isotopic changes that occur during hydration, which have implications for research in physical volcanology (quantities of residual magmatic water) and paleoenvironments (low temperature hydration rates and isotopic changes of glass).",

We present the latest earthquake relocation results for over 180,000 events from 1986 to 2014 recorded by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory seismic stations. We apply the three-dimensional ray tracing, waveform cross correlation, similar event analysis, and differential time location methods to improve both the absolute and relative earthquake location accuracies. Cross correlations are selected for event pairs with an average waveform correlation coefficient of 0.45 or greater and with at least 6 individual differential times with correlation coefficients of 0.55 or greater. We create synthetic data sets with the same source-receiver geometries as the real data and approximately the same statistical properties and examine the effects of different parameters and location algorithms. Our results provide insight regarding how to adjust parameters in the relocation processes for volcanic areas and obtain optimal results. These results build on the relocated catalogs of Matoza et al. (2013) and Lin et al. (2014) and also provide additional insights regarding this fine-scale seismicity structure in Hawaii. A longer-term goal of this work is more routine application of these methods to regularly update higher-resolution views of Hawaiian seismicity.",

            "abstract": "There has been a long-standing debate in geobiology about the role that Earth’s oxygenation played in the evolution of complex life. Temporal linkages exist between the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) and the evolution of eukaryotes, as well as Neoproterozoic rise in oxygen and the diversification of metazoans. Further advances have been hampered, however, by the lack of direct proxies that mark specific levels of atmospheric pO2 in the geologic past. Chromium (Cr) isotopes show promise in this regard because the oxidation of Cr during terrestrial weathering—which results in isotopic fractionation—is dependent on a specific threshold of atmospheric pO2 (0.1-1% of the present atmospheric level [PAL]). This threshold value broadly coincides with recent estimates of the oxygen requirements of early animals. Here we report new Cr-isotope data from four late Mesoproterozoic carbonate-dominated successions. Samples were collected from the Turukhansk Uplift (Siberia), the El Mreiti Group (Mauritania), the Vazante Group (Brazil), and the Angmaat Formation (Canada). We emphasize the application of Cr-isotopes to carbonate rocks because the broad temporal range of this lithology in the geologic record provides an opportunity to significantly expand our understanding of Proterozoic oxygenation on shorter time scales. Our data indicate that pO2 levels required to support early animals were attained long before Neoproterozoic metazoan diversification, although the large degree of isotopic heterogeneity in our dataset may indicate that pO2 > 0.1-1% PAL was only a transient phenomenon in the Mesoproterozoic. This study demonstrates the utility of Cr-isotopes as an atmospheric redox proxy in carbonate rocks and helps inform future avenues of research on Proterozoic pO2 thresholds.",

Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major product of, and thus a tracer for, this chemistry. As one of the few volatile organic compounds (VOC) observable via remote sensing, HCHO offers an invaluable constraint on the global distribution of isoprene emissions. Shortcomings in current chemical mechanisms, however, challenge our understanding of the link between isoprene emissions and HCHO abundance. Uncertainties are most severe under low-NOx conditions, which are often prevalent in regions with high biogenic emissions.\nUsing observations from the 2013 SENEX mission, we will quantify the isoprene-HCHO relationship across the wide range of chemical regimes encountered in the southeast U.S. Model-assisted analysis will focus on the NOx dependence of HCHO production and its mechanistic underpinnings. Accurate model representation of this relationship is crucial for top-down constraints of isoprene emissions.

            "abstract": "Improved constraints on lower-mantle composition are fundamental to understand the accretion, differentiation and thermochemical evolution of our planet. Whereas cosmochemical arguments indicate that lower-mantle rocks may be enriched in Si relative to upper-mantle pyrolite, seismic tomography images suggest whole-mantle convection and efficient mantle mixing. This study reconciles cosmochemical and geophysical constraints using the stagnation of some slab segments at ~1,000 km depth as the key observation. Whereas slab stagnation at ~660 km depth is well explained by the effects of the spinel-perovskite endothermic phase transition, flattening of slabs in the uppermost lower mantle remains poorly understood. Through numerical modeling of subduction, we show that enrichment of the lower mantle in intrinsically dense basaltic heterogeneity can render slabs neutrally buoyant at ~1,000 km depth. Slab stagnation (at ~660 and ~1,000 km depth) as well as unimpeded slab sinking to great depths can only coexist as three different modes of slab sinking behavior on Earth if the basalt fraction is ~8% higher in the lower than in the upper mantle, equivalent to a lower-mantle Mg/Si of ~1.18. Geodynamic models demonstrate that such a moderate compositional gradient can be sustained by compositional filtering of both slabs and plumes as they cross the transition zone, and thus persist over billions of years of whole-mantle convection. Whereas basaltic heterogeneity tends to get trapped in the transition zone and ultimately sink into the lower mantle, harzburgitic heterogeneity tends to rise into the uppermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography reveals two antipodal LLSVPs in the Earth’s mantle, each extending from the core-mantle boundary (CMB) up to ~1000 km depth. The LLSVPs are thought to host primitive mantle materials that bear witness of early-Earth processes, and/or subducted basalt that has cumulated in the mantle over billions of years. A compositional distinction between the LLSVPs and the ambient mantle is supported by anti-correlation of bulk-sound and shear-wave velocity (Vs) anomalies as well as abrupt lateralgradients in Vs along LLSVP margins. Both of these observations, however, are mainly restricted to the LLSVP bottom domains (2300~2900 km depth). Comparison of seismic observations with mineral-physics data suggests that these bottom domains are more likely to be composed of primitive mantle than of basaltic material. On the other hand, the seismic signature of the LLSVP shallow domains (1000~2300 km depth) is consistent with a basaltic composition, though a purely thermal origin cannot be ruled out.\nHere, we explore the dynamical, seismological, and geochemical implications of the hypothesis that the LLSVPs are compositionally layered with a primitive bottom domain and a basaltic shallow domain (see Fig.). We test this hypothesis using 2D thermochemical mantle-convection models. Depending on the density difference between primitive and basaltic materials, the materials either mix or remain separate as they join to form thermochemical piles in the deep mantle. Separation of both materials within the piles provides an explanation for LLSVP seismic properties, including substantial internal vertical gradients in Vs observed at 400-700 km height above the CMB. Geodynamic models predict short-lived “secondary” plumelets to rise from the roofs of these compositionally layered piles while entraining basaltic material that has evolved in the lower mantle. Long-lived “primary” plumes rise from LLSVP margins and entrain a mix of materials, including small fractions of primitive mantle material. These predictions address the geochemical and geochronological record of intraplate hotspot volcanism in the Pacific. LLSVP compositional layering has indeed important implications for our understanding of heat and material fluxes through mantle reservoirs, as well as bulk Earth chemistry and evolution.",

In this study, area and degree of aeolian desertification were assessed at different spatial scales from 30m to 1km by using TM and Landsat8 imageries, respectively. Then, landscape pattern index was utilized to explain effect of spatial resolution on the satellite-based assessment of aeolian desertification in the middle of Mu Us and the west of Otindag Sandy Lands in Inner Mongolia of China. Our results indicate: (1) The middle of Mu Us was rehabilitated from 2000 to 2014 by reduction of desertified area from 12,861 km2 to 11,700 km2. Whereas, the desertified area of the west of Otindag fluctuated but rebounded during the last five years; (2) scale effects on the area and degree of desertified land were not significant, along the spatial resolution, the desertified area fluctuated from12,962km2 to 12,861km2 for Mu Us hinterland and from 7,752km2to 7,700km2 for Otindag west, which corresponds 0.78% and 0.67 % of relative variations, respectively.

            "abstract": "Rural livelihoods and the land systems on which they depend are increasingly influenced by distant markets through economic globalization. Place-based analyses of land and livelihood system sustainability must then consider both proximate and distant influences on local decision-making. Thus, advancing land change theory in the context of economic globalization calls for a systematic understanding of the general processes as well as local contingencies shaping local responses to global signals. Synthesis of insights from place-based case studies of land and livelihood change is a path forward for developing such systematic knowledge. This paper introduces a model-based synthesis approach to investigating the influence of local socio-environmental and agent-level factors in mediating land-use and livelihood responses to changing global market signals. A generalized agent-based modeling framework is applied to six case-study sites that differ in environmental conditions, market access and influence, and livelihood settings. The largest modeled land conversions and livelihood transitions to market-oriented production occurred in sties with relatively productive agricultural land and/or with limited livelihood options. Experimental shifts in the distributions of agents’ risk tolerances generally acted to attenuate or amplify responses to changes in global market signals. Importantly, however, responses of agents at different points in the risk tolerance distribution varied widely, with the wealth gap growing wider between agents with higher or lower risk tolerance. These results demonstrate model-based synthesis is a promising approach to overcome many of the challenges of current synthesis methods in land change science, and to identify generalized as well as locally contingent responses to global market signals.",

            "abstract": "In the Pacific Northwest the Early-Middle Eocene was a time of widespread magmatism and tectonic reorganization that included accretion of the Siletzia terrane, Challis volcanism, and establishment of the modern Cascade arc. Although individual events are well documented our knowledge of the underlying tectonic framework is incomplete. To better understand the tectonic changes that occurred during this interval we studied the ~48 Ma Basalt of Summit Creek (BSC), a 1500m section of lavas located south of Mt. Rainier that erupted during the critical time period between the docking of Siletzia and the initiation of the modern Cascade arc.\nThe BSC consists mainly of tholeiitic basalts (wt. % SiO2 = 45.54-63.45, Mg# = 0.68-0.30) with EMORB traits (La/YbN = 1.2-5.9; 206Pb/204Pb = 19.005-19.102; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.538-15.593; 208Pb/204Pb = 38.560-38.714). These lavas lack arc signatures (e.g., HFSE depletions) but overlap in elemental and isotopic composition with oceanic basalts of the Crescent Formation (part of Siletzia) located ~100 km to the west.\nWe suggest that emplacement of lavas that lack arc traits in what was the forearc was a response to break off of the Farallon slab, which occurred as a result of the accretion of Siletzia at ~49 Ma (Wells et al., 2014). Break off opened a gap in the subducted slab, allowing upwelling and subsequent decompression melting. BSC lavas are consistent in age, location and composition with this model.\nAfter break off subduction resumed outboard of Siletzia, initiating the Cascade arc. Thus, BSC provides evidence of Farallon slab break off and furthers our understanding of the tectonic transition from widespread magmatism of the Early-Middle Eocene to the Cascade arc.",

An intercomparison of high-latitude precipitation characteristics from observation-based and reanalysis products is performed. Precipitation products from GPM and the cloud profiling radar on the CloudSat satellite provide an independent assessment to other products which have already been widely used, these being the observationally-based GPCP, GPCC and CMAP and the reanalyses ERA-Interim, MERRA and NCEP-DOE. Seasonal and annual total precipitation in both hemispheres poleward of 55° latitude is considered in all products, and GPM and CloudSat products are used to assess frequency of precipitation occurrence by phase, defined as rain, snow or mixed phase. Estimates of snowfall over Antarctica and Greenland are compared from various products. A number of disagreements on regional or seasonal scales are identified which will be reported and discussed. These estimates from observations and reanalyses provide useful insights for diagnostic assessment of precipitation products in high latitudes, quantifying the current uncertainties among observations and reanalyses, and establishing a benchmark for assessment of climate models.",

            "abstract": "Arctic soils are a critical ecological resource, yet are increasingly vulnerable to global change. In the Kangerlussuaq region of West Greenland, aeolian disturbance is the greatest threat to soil stability, with strong katabatic winds eroding vegetation and soil down to the underlying glacial till or bedrock. Little is known about what controls the distribution and rate of the aeolian erosion, which initially results in a state change from tundra to a deflated and nearly unvegetated ground. It is unclear if vegetation can eventually reestablish after erosion occurs, potentially aided by the biological soil crust (BSC) that develops within the eroded areas, or if this soil loss is an irreversible change in vegetation and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling.\nOur analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery shows that across the entire study region, deflated ground covers 22% of the terrestrial landscape. Aeolian erosion occurs more frequently closer to the Greenland Ice Sheet and on S-facing slopes. Using lichenometry, we estimate that erosional fronts move across the landscape at rates of 2.5 cm yr-1, leaving unproductive ground in their wake. The onset of widespread aeolian erosion occurred roughly 700-1000 years ago, pointing toward regional cooling and aridity as the drivers behind erosion. Finally, we consider whether the BSCs can improve soil quality enough to allow for full vegetation regrowth. Preliminary results show that while the BSCs fix atmospheric N and increase C storage, the rate of soil quality recovery is extremely slow.\nUnderstanding the thresholds between vegetated tundra and eroded ground is critical for predicting how the Kangerlussuaq landscape will respond to anticipated changes in climate and ice sheet dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Estimating global barystatic sea-level variations from monthly mean gravity fields delivered by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission requires additional information about geocenter motion. These variations are not available directly due to the mission implementation in the CM-frame and are represented by the degree-1 terms of the spherical harmonics expansion. Global degree-1 estimates can be determined with the method of Swenson et al. (2008) from ocean mass variability, the geometry of the global land-sea distribution, and GRACE data of higher degrees and orders. Consequently, a recursive relation between the derivation of ocean mass variations from GRACE data and the introduction of geocenter motion into GRACE data exists.\nIn this contribution, we will present a recent improvement to the processing strategy described in Bergmann-Wolf et al. (2014) by introducing a non-homogeneous distribution of global ocean mass variations in the geocenter motion determination strategy, which is due to the effects of loading and self-attraction induced by mass redistributions at the surface. A comparison of different GRACE-based oceanographic products (barystatic signal for both the global oceans and individual basins; barotropic transport variations of major ocean currents) with degree-1 terms estimated with a homogeneous and non-homogeneous ocean mass representation will be discussed, and differences in noise levels in most recent GRACE solutions from GFZ (RL05a), CSR, and JPL (both RL05) and their consequences for the application of this method will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The geochemistry recorded in carbonate foraminiferal tests (shells) is often used as proxy for past oceanographic events and environments. By understanding past oceanic and climatic conditions, we can better predict future climate scenarios, a relevant ability in these times of global change. The fact that foraminifera are biological entities can be pivotal for understanding their geochemical records. Thus, growing foraminifera under known physicochemical conditions and analyzing the geochemistry of their cultured carbonate can yield insightful perspectives for proxy refinement and development. Because parameters often co-vary in nature, proper proxy calibration can only be done with materials grown in strictly controlled and known environments. This presentation will review the various crucial aspects of foraminiferal maintenance and culturing, especially from the perspective of proxy development. These fundamentals were used to design a long-term multi-stressor experiment with oxygen, pCO2 (pH), and temperature as variables to test the single, double or triple threats of deoxygenation, ocean acidification, and oceanic warming. Results on assemblage composition, survivorship and growth of a continental shelf benthic foraminiferal community will be presented. Although one agglutinated morphospecies grew in each of the five treatments, growth of individual calcareous species was more restricted. Initial results indicate that pCO2 was not the factor that impacted communities most. Supported in part by NSF OCE-1219948.",

After methane hydrate is dissociated, gas and water flow in pore space. There is a concern about the erosion of mud surface and it may result in flow blockage that disturbs the gas production. As a part of a Japanese National hydrate research program (MH21, funded by METI), we developed a numerical simulation of water-induced mud erosion in pore-scale sand-mud domains to model such mud erosion. The size of which is of the order of 100 micro meter. Water flow is simulated using a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and mud surface is treated as solid boundary with arbitrary shape, which changes with time. Periodic boundary condition is adopted at the domain boundaries, except for the surface of mud layers and the upper side. Shear stress acting on the mud surface is calculated using a momentum-exchange method. Mud layer is eroded when the shear stress exceeds a threshold coined a critical shear stress.\nIn this study, we compared the simulated mud erosion rate with experimental data acquired from an experiment using artificial sand-mud core. As a result, the simulated erosion rate agrees well with that of the experiment.",

            "abstract": "Mechanical and physical properties of shales are of major importance for upper crustal fault hydro-mechanical behavior. In particular, relationships between applied stress, textural anisotropy and transport properties. These relations can be investigated in the laboratory and here, was used shales from Tournemire (southern France).\nTriaxial tests were performed in order to determine the elasto-plastic yield envelope on 3 sets of samples with 3various bedding orientations (0°, 45°, and 90°). For each set, experiments were carried out at increasing confining pressures (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80MPa). They were performed under nominally drained conditions, at strain rates ranging between 5x10-7 s-1 - 1x10-5 s-1up to failure. During each experiment, P and S wave elastic velocities were continuously measured, in order to monitor the evolution of elastic anisotropy.\nResults show that the orientation of principal stress relative to bedding plays an important role on the brittle strength. Minimum strength is observed for samples deformed at 45\u000e to bedding. Strength anisotropy increases both with confi ning pressure and strain rate. We interpret this result as the cohesive strength (and fracture toughness) being strain rate dependent. Although brittle failure and stress drops were systematically observed, deformation remained aseismic. This confi rms that shales are good lithological candidates for shallow aseismic creep and slow slip events. Brittle failure was preceded by the development of P wave anisotropy, due to both crack growth and mineral re-orientation. Anisotropy variations were largest for samples deformed perpendicular to bedding, at the onset of rupture. Anisotropy reversal was observed at the highest confi ning pressures. For samples deformed parallel to bedding, the P wave anisotropy development is weaker. For both of these orientations, Thomsens parameters were inverted from the elastic wave data in order to quantify the evolution of elastic anisotropy.\nWe also studied the evolution of P waves velocities of samples coming from a natural fault. So we could observe the anisotropy evolution and that the deformation develops the same way in our triaxial experiments and in the natural fault, with re-orientation of layers and coalescence of several fractures to form the fault core.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved methane in shallow groundwater drives public concern about the safety of hydraulic fracturing. We report dissolved alkane and nitrogen gas concentrations and their stable isotope values (δ13C and δ15N, respectively) from 208 water wells in Parker county, Texas. These data are used to differentiate ‘stray’ natural gas and low temperature microbial methane, and (2) estimate the ratio of stray gas to groundwater. The ratio of (gas-phase) stray natural gas to groundwater is estimated by correlating dissolved methane and nitrogen concentrations and dissolved nitrogen δ15N values. Our hypothesis is groundwater exposed to high volumes of stray natural gas have high dissolved methane concentrations and low dissolved nitrogen concentrations and δ15N values. Alternatively, groundwater exposed to low volumes of stray gas-phase natural gas have elevated dissolved methane, but the concentration of dissolved nitrogen and its d15N value is atmospheric. A cluster of samples in Parker county have high concentrations of dissolved methane (>10mg/L) with d13Cmethane and alkane ratios (C1/C2+C3) typical of natural gas from the Barnett Shale and the Strawn Formation. Coupling dissolved nitrogen concentrations and δ15N values with these results, we suggest that few of the wells in this cluster preserve large gas to water ratios. Many samples with high dissolved methane concentrations have atmospheric dissolved nitrogen concentrations and δ15N values, providing evidence against high flux natural gas transport into shallow groundwater. These results demonstrate that dissolved nitrogen chemistry, in addition to dissolved alkane and noble gas measurements, may be useful to discern sources of dissolved methane and estimate ratios of stray natural gas-water ratios.",

However, the distribution of these waves in subauroral regions has not been well characterized. In this study we present 0-5 Hz magnetic field data from the Van Allen Probes A (RBSP A) spacecraft (in elliptical equatorial orbit with apogee at 5.8 RE), 0-1 Hz data from GOES-13 (in geosynchronous orbit), and 0-5 Hz data from Halley, Antarctica (L ~4.6), during the first full local-time precession of the Van Allen Probes from October 2012 through July 2014. The considerably different hourly local time vs. L distributions observed point to distinct locations and geomagnetic activity-dependent patterns of EMIC wave activity. GOES-13 wave occurrences exhibited a broad peak in the noon-to-dusk sector. He+ band events peaked near dusk, while H+ band waves peaked near noon, with a secondary peak centered near dawn. More EMIC waves occurred during storm main phase in the He+ band (5%) than in the H+ band (1%), and 80% and 89% of the He+ and H+ band waves, respectively, occurred under late storm recovery or quiet conditions. During all storm phases the local time occurrence patterns of < 0.4 Hz and 0.4–1.0 Hz events at Halley resembled those of He+ and H+ band waves, respectively, at GOES-13. The relatively few wave events at Halley with f > 1.0 Hz occurred at all local times, but with a modest, broad peak near dawn. Roughly 90% of both the 1570 Halley events < 1.0 Hz and the 142 Halley events > 1.0 Hz occurred during late storm recovery and quiet conditions. Events during compressions at GOES-13 (10%), Halley (6%), and RBSP A (6%) peaked near local noon, but with a secondary peak near midnight. Waves observed by RBSP A were distributed rather evenly in local time in all L shell ranges between 3 and 6, and the percentage occurring during late storm recovery or quiet conditions was only 65%. We interpret the difference in event occurrence during these latter storm phases between GOES-13 and RBSP A to be a function of the L dependence of the injection boundary and plasmapause on magnetic activity, and their frequency-dependent occurrence at Halley to be evidence of horizontal ducting.",

            "abstract": "About one third of the land surface is covered by forests, emitting approximately 75% of the total biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). The main atmospheric sink of these BVOCs during daytime is the oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH). Over the last decades field campaigns investigating the radical chemistry in forested regions showed that atmospheric chemistry models are often not able to describe the measured OH concentration well. At low NO concentrations and an OH reactivity dominated by BVOCs the OH was underestimated. This discrepancy could only partly be explained by the discovery of new OH regeneration pathways in the isoprene oxidation mechanism. Field campaigns in the U.S.A and Finland (Kim 2013 ACP, Hens 2014 ACP) demonstrated that in monoterpene (e.g. α-pinene) dominated environments model calculations also underpredict the observed HO2 and OH concentrations significantly even if the OH budget was closed by the measured OH production and destruction terms. These observations suggest the existence of an unaccounted source of HO2. One potential HO2 source in forests is the photolysis of monoterpene degradation products such as aldehydes. In the present study the photochemical degradation mechanism of α-pinene was investigated in the Jülich atmosphere simulation chamber SAPHIR. The focus of this study was in particular on the investigation of the role of pinonaldehyde, a main first generation product of α-pinene, as a possible HO2 source. For that purpose the pinonaldehyde yields of the reaction α-pinene + OH were determined at ambient monoterpene concentrations (<5 ppb) under low NOx as well as high NOx conditions. The pinonaldehyde yield under high NOx conditions (30.5 %) is in agreement with literature values of Wisthaler (2001 AE) and Aschmann (2002 JGR), under low NOx conditions the yield (10.8 %) is approximately a factor of three lower than the value published by Eddingsaas (2012 ACP). In a second set of experiments the photolysis rate of pinonaldehyde was determined from the decay of the measured concentration time series of pinonaldehyde in the presence of an OH scavenger. The photolysis experiments showed that the pinonaldehyde photolysis is about a factor of 5 faster than assumed by MCM 3.2, leading to a significant rise in the modelled HO2 concentration.",

            "abstract": "Some bioturbators build tubes in the sediment and pump water through their burrows (ventilation). Oxygen is transferred through the burrow walls in the adjacent sediment (bioirrigation). Bioirrigation is playing a pivotal role in the mediation of biogeochemical processes in lake sediments and has the potential to enhance nutrient cycling. The present study investigates the impact of bioirrigation on lake sediment metabolism, respiration rates and in particular, the biogeochemical impacts of bioirrigation intensity as a function of organism density. We therefore apply the bioreactive Resazurin/Resorufin smart tracer system for quantifying the impact of different densities of Chironomidae (Diptera) larvae (0-2112 larvae/m2) on lake sediment respiration in a microcosm experiment. Tracer decay has been found to be proportional to the amount of the aerobic respiration at the sediment-water interface. Tracer transformation was in good agreement with Chironomidae density (correlation, r=0.9). Tracer transformation rates (and sediment respiration) were found to be correlated to Chironomidae density, with highest transformation rates observed in the microcosms with highest density of 2112 larvae/m2. This relationship was not linear though, with sediment respiration rates at the highest larvae densities declining from the linear trend predicted from lower and intermediate larvae density-respiration relationships. We interpret this effect as a density dependent suppression of the Chironomid’s metabolic activity. The observations of this study have implications for eutrophied lakes with high densities of bioirrigators. Despite high density of bioirrigirrigating benthos, mineralization of the organic matter in such habitats would likely be lower than in lakes with intermediate densities of the bioturbators.",

Over slightly more than four Earth-years, MASCS measured emission profiles versus altitude for calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and magnesium (Mg) at a daily cadence. These species exhibit different spatial distributions, suggesting distinct source processes. MASCS observed seasonal variations in all three species that are remarkably repeatable from one Mercury year to the next, and did so consistently during the entire 17-Mercury-year duration of the orbital phase of the mission. Whereas MASCS has characterized the seasonal variation, it has provided, at best, only weak evidence for the episodic behavior observed in ground-based studies of Na. Joint analyses of MASCS observations and surface precipitation patterns for energetic particles inferred from observations by the Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS) and the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) on MESSENGER have not yielded clear correlations. This lack of correlation may be due in part to the MASCS observational geometries. MASCS has conducted a number of searches for other, weakly emitting species. Hydrogen data from the orbital phase are consistent with profiles observed during MESSENGER’s flybys of Mercury. Oxygen detections have proven elusive, and the previously reported observation with a brightness of 4 R may only be an upper limit. Ongoing analysis of weak species data suggests that additional species are present.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater use and its over-consumption are one of the major drivers in the hydrology of many major cities in the world, particularly in delta regions. Yet, a global assessment to identify cities with declining groundwater table problems has not been done yet. In this study we used the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB (10 km resolution, for 1960-2010). Using this model, we globally calculated groundwater recharge and river discharge/surface water levels, as well as global water demand and abstraction from ground- and surface water resources. The output of PCR-GLOBWB model was then used to force a groundwater MODFLOW-based model simulating spatio-temporal groundwater head dynamics, including groundwater head declines in all major cities – mainly in delta regions – due to escalation in abstraction of groundwater to meet increasing water demand.\nUsing these coupled models, we managed to identify a number of critical cities having groundwater table falling rates above 50 cm/year (average in 2000-2010), such as Barcelona, Houston, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York, Rome and many large cities in China, Libya, India and Pakistan, as well as in Middle East and Central Asia regions. However, our simulation results overestimate the depletion rates in San Jose, Tokyo, Venice, and other cities where groundwater usages have been aggressively managed and replaced by importing surface water from other places. Moreover, our simulation might underestimate the declining groundwater head trends in some familiar cases, such as Bangkok (12 cm/year), Ho Chi Minh City (34 cm/year), and Jakarta (26 cm/year). The underestimation was due to an over-optimistic model assumption in allocating surface water for satisfying urban water needs. In reality, many big cities, although they are located in wet regions and have abundant surface water availability, still strongly rely on groundwater sources due to inadequate facilities to treat and distribute surface water resources.",

            "abstract": "During disturbed times, ionospheric scintillations can be severe and adversely impact satellite-based positioning and radio transmissions. The scintillation occurs in the amplitude, phase, polarization, and angle of arrival of the signal. Precise observation, classification, modeling, forecasting, and development of data-driven methodologies to accurately localize ionospheric irregularities and simulate GNSS scintillation signals are highly desired.\nIonospheric scintillations have traditionally been quantified by amplitude (S4) and phase scintillations (σφ). Our study focuses on the Arctic, where scintillations, especially phase scintillations, are prominent. We will present observations acquired from a network of Greenlandic GNSS stations, including 2D amplitude and phase scintillation index maps for representative calm and storm periods. In addition to the traditional indices described above, we are exploring a set of indices derived from the power spectra of the signals. The observed corner frequency of the power spectrum is a function of the Fresnel radius and the drift speed of the irregularities, while the slope of the power spectrum is related to the Fresnel oscillations. We will demonstrate how spectral characteristics of the scintillations act under large total electron content (TEC) gradients and how physical parameters can be extracted from the power spectra, and will present how these parameters of the corner frequencies and power spectra slopes vary during ionospheric storms.\nThe observations will then be compared to properties of simulated GNSS signals computed by the Fast Scintillation Mode (FSM). The FSM was developed to simulate ionospheric scintillations under different geophysical conditions, and is used to simulate GNSS signals with known scintillation characteristics. This comparison could lead to a better understanding of the observed ionospheric state.",

The model has been developed primarily to examine the physical phenomena underlying the formation and maintenance of zonal jets on Jupiter, and the interactions between these and small-scale turbulent eddies, in particular how these depend on moist convective processes. Initial work without moist convection found a strong dependence of the strength and direction of the equatorial jet on the internal heat flux, including a prograde equatorial jet, but not at the speeds observed on the planet.

            "abstract": "The fact that flash floods initiated in arable catchments are often accompanied by massive sediment and nutrient loads often leads to the assumption that surface runoff is the principle pathway by which runoff reaches watercourses. But the hydrology of cultivated catchments has its specific features due to the temporary variable topsoil properties and a sharp divide between topsoil and compacted subsoil. Under various conditions the prevailing runoff mechanisms may vary from surface runoff to subsurface runoff or deep percolation. On the basis of an evaluation of several rainfall-runoff events in a representative agricultural catchment (Nucice, Czech Republic), we show that runoff from cultivated land may be generated in a way similar to that seen on forested slopes, where shallow subsurface runoff is the predominant pathway. To identify the predominant runoff pathway, we employed a combination of turbidity measurements and stream discharge data. Although we observed temporal variability of topsoil properties attributable to seasonal weather changes and agricultural activities, e.g. bulk density and porosity, runoff generation was mainly driven by precipitation characteristics and the initial catchment saturation. The concept of the runoff formation was also observed during plot scale experiments with rainfall simulator. Various initial soil moisture conditions, and vegetation stages delimited the simulations. Variable proportions of both monitored runoff components were observed in relation to rainfall intensity and duration, ranging from zero surface runoff to a distinct dominance of surface runoff. Even with the highest tested precipitation intensities, surface runoff always formed due to saturation excess of the topsoil, irrespective of the topsoil properties and crops. The experiments were numerically modelled and analysed to understand the effect of temporal variability in the macropores and intra-aggregate voids ratio within the topsoil. We used a combination of physically based macroscopic models S1D and HYPO. In the S1D the dual permeability approach with two coupled Richards equations is used, the simultaneously operating HYPO code is based on a diffusion wave (Boussinesq eq.).

            "abstract": "Land-use change (LUC) resulting from biofuel feedstock production can alter soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of lands producing those crops and the crops they displace, possibly resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. LUC GHG emissions included in biofuel life cycle analysis (LCA) have at times been estimated to be so great that biofuels did not offer a greenhouse gas reduction compared to conventional fossil fuels. To improve the accuracy of emissions estimates, SOC changes must be considered at a finer spatial resolution and take into account climate, soil, land use and management factors. This study reports on the incorporation of global LUC as predicted by a computable general equilibrium model (i.e., GTAP) and spatially-explicit modeled SOC estimates (using surrogate CENTURY) for various biofuel feedstock scenarios into a widely-used LCA model (i.e., GREET). Resulting estimates suggest: SOC changes associated with domestic corn production might contribute 2-6% or offset as much as 5% of total corn ethanol life-cycle GHG emissions. On the other hand, domestic LUC GHG emissions for switchgrass ethanol have the potential offset up to 60% of GHG emissions in the fuel’s life cycle. Further, large SOC sequestration is predicted for Miscanthus feedstock production, enabling Miscanthus-based ethanol systems to offset all life-cycle GHG emissions and create a net carbon sink. LUC GHG emissions for ethanol derived from corn stover are small compared to other sources. Total life-cycle GHG emissions (g CO2eq MJ-1, 100cm soil) were estimated to be 59–66 for corn ethanol, 14 for stover ethanol, 18-26 for switchgrass ethanol, and -7 – -0.6 for Miscanthus ethanol.",

The results show that the number of earthquakes, which occurred around the extreme value point of the earth tide, is larger than that occurred on other phases. The phase selectivity parameter (p) evaluated based on the Schuster’s method varies inversely as the significant level of the correlation between the earth tide and earthquake occurrence. First, the earthquakes are classified in to three types by magnitude: type a (M≥6.0), type b (5.0≤M＜6.0) and type c (4.0≤M<5.0). The values of p are 30.22%, 24.2% and 10.5% for type a, b, and c, respectively. Second, the earthquakes of type c are divided into two subgroups by depth of the earthquakes, and their values of p for shallow (depth＜70 km) and deep (depth≥70 km) earthquakes are 6.5% and 95.67%, respectively. These results suggest that the shallow (<70km) and small (M<5.0) earthquakes correlate better with the earth tide than the deep and large earthquakes do.\nKey words: earth tide, earthquake, triggering",

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy, caused a total economic loss of about $65 billion and in the state of Maryland, approximately $13.55 million. The purpose of this study is to determine what, if any effect do hurricanes have on monthly and annual precipitation in Maryland. Furthermore, using this information, discussion can be made on hurricane activity in Maryland and the possible connection to global climate change. To achieve this goal, three objectives were developed to: 1) Gain a better understanding of Maryland’s terrain and how that affects precipitation; 2) Calculate monthly and annual precipitation in the state; and 3) Calculate how much precipitation was contributed by each hurricane. The NASA TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation products were used. Our results show that hurricanes do significantly affect both monthly and annual precipitation in Maryland, so much so that if removed, most monthly and annual precipitations would be below their averages. The methodology could be applied to other states or regions as well. Giving the global warming scenario, it is important to understand changes of hurricane size, track and intensity since both can have significant impacts on Maryland, which warrants further studies.",

As such, magnetotail reconnection, especially at lunar distances where the effect of the Earth's dipole is small, should be closest to simple models.\nIon heating has recently been studied systematically in solar wind and magnetopause reconnection, but not in the magnetotail. The energetics of magnetotail reconnection jets are particularly interesting as the available magnetic energy per particle (Bin2/μ0nin = miVA,in2) is typically orders of magnitude higher and the inflow plasma beta much lower than in the solar wind and at the magnetopause.\nWe survey ARTEMIS data from 2011-2014 for fast reconnection flows and analyse their statistical properties. In particular, we address (i) the ion temperature increase (ii) ion temperature anisotropy and firehose instability, and (iii) the underlying ion dynamics. We examine the spatial structure of the ion temperature across the exhaust, and compare with particle-in-cell simulations. We find that the temperature parallel to the magnetic field dominates near the edges of the jet, while the very center of the exhaust has Tperp > Tpara, indicating Speiser-like ion motion.",

Here we introduce a new fluid model and closure for collisionless magnetic reconnection and more general applications. It has recently been shown that electron pressure anisotropy is important in setting the structure of the reconnection region, and a closure based on the drift kinetic equation using a distribution of trapped and passing particles has been derived [1,2,3]. We extend the model and present a general expression for moments of the distribution function. By evolving the heat flux tensor and closing at the fourth velocity moment, we obtain a self-consistent set of fluid equations, which includes the evolution of the off-diagonal elements of the pressure tensor. The model is implemented in a two-fluid code [4] and the results are compared to PIC simulations of guide field reconnection.\n[1] Egedal et al. Phys Plasmas (2013)\n[2] Le et al.

This was performed, most often, from a multiple linear regression of merged satellite ozone data sets. As mentioned in that report, three factors with a potential major impact were not readily accounted for in those analyses: diurnal variability of ozone, biases between data sets, and long-term drifts between data sets. Herein we discuss an additional complication that is intricately tied to these three factors in this kind of analysis, namely the non-uniform temporal, spatial, and diurnal sampling of the different instruments used for these merged data sets. This non-uniform sampling can have a detrimental impact not only on the regression techniques used to derive long-term trends in ozone but also on other analyses performed to determine diurnal variability or the magnitude of potential biases and drifts between data sets. Additionally, we discuss a recently developed technique that not only accounts for the potential sampling issues, but also the perceived diurnal variability, as well as any potential bias and/or drift between instruments in a single analysis.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal water storage in mountain snowpack is a critical water resource but its variability is highly uncertain in time and space. Here we compare methods for analyzing the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Using progressively more complex techniques, we interpolate measurements from over 250 snow courses and 100 automatic snow sensors to obtain a map of SWE over the entire mountain range. Interpolation methods range from simple regressions utilizing only latitude, longitude, and elevation, to more complex approaches that additionally consider temperature, precipitation, aspect, and others. We explore the differences between maps obtained from interpolations of only snow courses, only snow pillows, and the combined datasets. We additionally consider a model simulation from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model run at 3-km resolution. Biases from the interpolations and the WRF simulation are determined through evaluation against an existing 90-m resolution product based upon data assimilation and SWE reconstruction techniques. Comparisons of the SWE maps will allow us to determine if one method overestimates or underestimates with regards to the others and whether interpolation is useful for a spatially heterogeneous variable such as SWE. We select three different years to study in order to capture a range of snowpack conditions. Water year 2009 (October 2008 through September 2009) was an average snow accumulation year for the region. We also select water year 2005 for a high accumulation year and water year 2014 for a low accumulation year. It is likely that each method will result in different SWE estimates, revealing the uncertainty involved in snow hydrology.",

Could the associated Lorentz forces generate sunquakes, as suggested by Hudson et al. 2008? Here, we present the first MHD simulations of sunquake generation by magnetic field perturbations, and explore the details of this mechanism. The downgoing magnetic field change is modelled as an Alfven wave, which propagates into the lower atmosphere. When it reaches the vicinity of the beta=1 layer (where the Alfven and sound speeds are equal), non-linear coupling excites a downgoing acoustic wave, which we interpret as a sunquake. The amplitude of the acoustic wave increases nonlinearly with the amplitude of the magnetic perturbation, reaching a limit where around 35% of the injected Poynting flux is transferred to the seismic wave - enough energy to match sunquake observations.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation in mountainous regions can trigger flash floods and landslides especially in areas affected by wildfire. Because of the small space-time scales required for observation, they remain poorly observed. A light-weighted X-band polarimetric radar can rapidly respond to the situation and provide continuous rainfall information with high resolution for flood forecast and emergency management. A preliminary assessment of added values to the operational practice in Mineral county, Colorado was performed in Fall 2014 and Summer 2015 with a transportable polarimetric radar deployed at the Lobo Overlook. This region is one of the numerous areas in the Rocky Mountains where the WSR-88D network does not provide sufficient weather coverage due to blockages, and the limitations have impeded forecasters and local emergency managers from making accurate predictions and issuing weather warnings. High resolution observations were collected to document the precipitation characteristics and demonstrate the added values of deploying a small weather radar in such context. The analysis of the detailed vertical structure of precipitation explain the decreased signal sampled by the operational radars. The specific microphysics analyzed though polarimetry suggest that the operational Z-R relationships may not be appropriate to monitor severe weather over this wildfire affected region. Collaboration with the local emergency managers and the National Weather Service shows the critical value of deploying mobile, polarimetric and unmanned radars in complex terrain.

Current urban area is about 10% compared with 0.05% in Qing Dynasty in eastern China.(4)The simulation results show that in the centennial time scale, the trend of precipitation change during the past 300 years is ‘more-less-more’ in the part of North China. The difference of precipitation between 1995 and 1724 shows that increase in broadleaf forest area might increase the precipitation while the extending of crop land will result in decrease in precipitation.(5)Land use change has significant effect on the surface air temperature.

Comparative analysis is provided for radiocaesium wash-off parameters and distribution coefficient in rivers and surface runoff on Fukushima and Chernobyl contaminated areas for the first years after the accidents. It is found that radiocaesium distribution coefficient in rivers of Fukushima is essentially higher (1-2 orders of magnitude) than correspondent values for rivers and surface runoff of the Chernobyl zone. Normalized dissolved wash-off coefficients for watersheds of Fukushima are at least 1 order of magnitude lower correspondent values for Chernobyl zone. Normalized particulate wash-off coefficients are comparable for Fukushima and Chernobyl.

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to modify overall climatic conditions and therefore, suitability for cropping. Assessment of when and what meteorological stresses will crops meet in the future is highly useful for planners and land managers who can apply adaptation strategies to improve agricultural potentialities.\nWe propose to evaluate the impacts of climate change on suitability for maize cropping in terms of ecophysiology (e.g., heat stress during grain filling), yield quality (e.g., thermal conditions on protein content) and cultural practices performance (e.g., days available for harvest according to risk of waterlogged soil compaction) in two French areas. The Midi-Pyrénées (southern) and Ile-de-France (northern) regions were chosen as representing the two distinct climates when dividing France into southern and northern parts. The Midi-Pyrénées region is a major irrigated maize producer but could become penalizing in the future because of heat and water stress. By contrast, northern France could become a more suitable area thanks to the expected increasing temperature.\nTo confirm our assumptions, we used the method assessment for crop-climate suitability developed in Caubel et al. (2015) and based on the sub-annual analysis of agroclimatic indicators calculated over phenological periods. Indicators have been calculated using climatic data from 1950 to 2100 simulated by the global climate ARPEGE at the meso-scale SAFRAN (8 km resolution) for the two areas and forced by a greenhouse effect corresponding to the SRES A1B scenario (similar to RCP 6.0). The evaluation was done for two distinct varieties in terms of precocity. Agroclimatic indicators characterizing water deficit and water excess impacts on crop were calculated for three soils with contrasting soil water reserves and depths. Finally, the evaluation was performed with a unique sowing date (the current one), and with an optimized sowing date according to water and thermal requirements for emergence. Consequences on phenology and therefore meteorological stresses enabled to decide where and when adapting the sowing date will be useful for improving maize potentiality.\nThis work is carried out under the research program ORACLE (Opportunities and Risks of Agrosystems & forests in response to CLimate, socio-economic and policy changEs in France).",

            "abstract": "Helium as the second most abundant species in the solar wind as well as in the interstellar medium should be prominent in the observations made be ENA detectors. Since IBEX-Hi detector was not equipped with a mass spectrometer, He ENA contribute only negligibly to the overall signal observed with the detector and are indistinguishable from the hydrogen ENAs. The situation will likely change with the ENA detector on IMAP. In our work we assess the expected heliospheric and potential extraheliospheric emission of He ENAs and show potential ability of He ENAs to resolve the structure of the LISM in the proximity of the heliosphere.\nWe assess the heliospheric emission using a simple model of the heliosphere that takes the Voyager observations into account. We assume helium ion spectra at the termination shock and propagate them through the inner heliosheath. The computed distributions are then used to integrate the He ENA fluxes. To assess the IBEX Ribbon emission we adapt the analytical model of the Secondary ENA emission by Moebius et al. 2013 for helium. We obtain that both the inner heliosheath and the Ribbon emissions are much weaker than the observed H ENA by IBEX, except from the heliotail.\nOne of the possible explanations for the IBEX Ribbon proposed by Grzedzielski et al. 2010 suggests that the signal originates in the boundary region between the LIC and the cavity of the Local Bubble. The main disadvantage of the model is the necessity of a short distance to this interface and low plasma density in the LIC, so that ionization processes do not extinct the signal. However, the mean free path for He ENAs ionization could be longer by an order of magnitude and reaches about 8000 AU. This should allow us to observe ENAs originating from suprathermal ions created in processes likely operating at the LIC boundaries, the distance to which could be ~0.1 pc. This makes He ENA observations a unique tool to observe such regions, currently inaccessible to optical telescopes.",

For example, green roofs experience dramatic fluctuations in soil moisture because they have limited soil water holding capacity and high rates of evaporation. Stonecrop (Sedum spp.) is widely planted in green roofs and its traits reflect an overall strategy of water conservation. In addition to succulent leaves and a slow growth rate, several stonecrop species possess inducible CAM photosynthesis. We made continuous measurements of ecosystem CO2 exchange, soil temperature (T), and volumetric soil moisture (θ) using a chamber-based automated monitoring system installed on a 3-year old green roof located in Buffalo, New York. Concurrent measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (Re) allowed us to estimate gross ecosystem CO2 exchange (GEE). We predicted that CAM photosynthesis by stonecrop would be induced by high T and low θ and would manifest at the ecosystem scale by a reductions in both reduced midday CO2 uptake associated with stomatal closure and nighttime net CO2 efflux as CAM-driven assimilation offset respiratory losses. Not surprisingly, increased T and decreased θ negatively influenced GEE while Re increased in response to increased T and θ. During a period of unusually hot, dry conditions the responses of GEE and Re were reflected in a decline in daytime NEE. However, this decline in NEE was not associated with a similar reduction in nighttime Re suggesting that these conditions were insufficient to induce CAM photosynthesis. Future ecohydrological investigations of green roofs may provide new insights into how rainfall variability interacts with plant traits, community diversity, and edaphic factors to shape ecosystem function.",

            "abstract": "Seismic models show high values of the heterogeneity ratio RS/P=δlnVS /δlnVP in the lower mantle. Based on the analysis of our new VS−VP model SPani, we show that estimated values are biased by data resolution, model parameterization and regularization choices. Spherical-average RS/P reduces from around 2.7 to 2.0, at 2500 km depth, if we apply different roughness damping to VP which does not compromise data fit and maintains unchanged the main structural features of the model. In agreement with previous studies, our model has relatively high RS/P in large low shear-velocity provinces, but a similar increasing trend is also observed in anomalously positive regions. We are unable to find any plausible physical explanation for this trend. Boosting the VP anomalies of 20% drastically reduces RS/P without significantly degrading the data fit. We conclude that lateral compositional variations are not required to explain seismic data. Our result also highlights the limitations of tomography images to directly extract important diagnostic compositional parameters as RS/P. ",

            "abstract": "The next generation U.S. geosynchronous weather satellite—GOES series R-U—will include for the first time a suprathermal plasma analyzer. The Magnetospheric Particle Sensor-Low (MPS-LO), an electrostatic analyzer utilizing triquadrispheric geometry (270° turn)deflection electrodes, will measure the flux of electrons and ions with energies between 30 eV - 30 keV in fifteen logarithmically-spaced differential energy channels and arrival direction in twelve angular bins. MPS-LO consists of two sensor heads mounted in a common electronics box. Each sensor head contains a set of deflection electrodes, microchannel plates, and segmented detector anodes. The common electronics box provides the power and I/O interface with a data processing unit, voltage supplies for all of the instrument’s electronics, high voltage for the deflection electrodes, in-flight calibration pulsers, and the digital electronics to process signals from sensor heads’ detector anodes. Great care was taken in the manufacture and mounting of the triquadrisphere deflection electrodes; each electrode was machined from a single piece of aluminum and specific electrode combinations were mounted with precision machined spacers and matched drilling. The precise fabrication and assembly resulted in near perfect spherical electric fields between the electrodes. The triquadrispheric electrode shape also prevents photons from reaching the detection elements-as a result, MPS-LO is solar blind. The combined field-of-view for the two sensor heads is 180° x 5°, with the larger angle in a plane perpendicular to the spacecraft’s orbit and its central axis oriented anti-Earthward. An incident particle’s arrival direction is determined in one of twelve 15° x 5° angular zones. A set of shielded anodes is used to measure the background caused by penetrating charged particles that reach the MCPs; this background data is used to correct the MPS-LO data. The instrument’s energy resolution ΔE/E is 5.8%.",

            "abstract": "Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) are commonly used in several fields and industries, such as chemical and pharmaceutical, due to both their physical and chemical properties. For example, they are employed in the manufacturing of catalysts, as fuel additives, and as polishing agents. The release and exposure to CeO2 NPs can occur during their fabrication, application, and waste disposal, as well as through their life-cycle and accidents. Therefore, the assessment of the dynamic nature of CeO2 NPs stability and mobilty in the environment is of paramount importance to establish the environmental and public health risks associated with their inevitable release in the environment. Humic substances are a key element of soils and have been revealed to possibly affect the fate and transport of nanoparticles in soils. Consequently, our present research aims at investigating the influence that different pHs, monovalent and divalent cations, Suwannee River humic acid, and Suwanee River fulvic acid have on the aggregation, transport, and deposition of CeO2 NPs. Batch studies performed with different concentrations of humic and fulvic acids associated with a wide spectrum of pHs and ionic strengths were examined. Key variables from these batch studies were then examined to simulate experimental conditions commonly encountered in the soil-water system to conduct column transport experiments in order to establish the fate and transport of CeO2 NPs in saturated porous media, which is a critical phase in characterizing the behavior of CeO2 NPs in subsurface environmental systems.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the behaviour of active continental-scale fault zones at depth, and in particular how displacements observed at the Earth’s surface are accommodated through the crust, is crucial to improving understanding of the earthquake cycle. This behaviour can be inferred by study of exhumed portions of ductile shear zones using methods such as recording strain profile(s) across the fault zone. However, due to the nature of mid-crustal rocks, strain markers tend to be rare and/or discontinuously distributed.\nThe intensity (I) of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of deformed minerals provides a proxy for strain that is continuous across fault zones. CPO are collected via electron back scattered diffraction in the scanning electron microscope. The strength of the CPO can be quantified using eigenvalue-based intensity parameters. Calibration of intensity with strain is achieved via comparison with visco-plastic self-consistency models of CPO evolution, although the temperature-dependent critical resolved shear stresses of potential crystal slip systems must be known.\nAs an example, we consider the dextral strike-slip Eskişehir shear zone, NW Turkey, which was active during the Oligocene and accommodated ~100km of displacement, including a component of late oblique-normal slip. An exhumed mid-crustal section of this fault zone is exposed in the Uludağ Massif, comprising of high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Uludağ Group, intruded by the Central and South Uludağ granites. Sample transects focussed on the pure calcic marbles that dominate the stratigraphy. Fortunately, the availability of experimental data for calcite crystal slip behaviour at different temperatures makes the application of the CPO intensity strain proxy method relatively straightforward.\nThe Uludağ Massif and Eskişehir shear zone provide a field based analogue for the ductile shear zone beneath the currently active North Anatolian Fault. The results of our CPO intensity-based strain profiles allow us to speculate on the current behaviour of the North Anatolian Fault, a major seismogenic feature, at depth.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate rocks are notoriously difficult to characterize. Their abrupt facies variations give rise to drastic changes in the petrophysical properties of the reservoir. Such heterogeneity, when further associated with variations in rock mineralogy due to diagenetic processes, result in a challenging scenario to model from the pore to the field scale. Micro-CT imaging is one of the most promising technologies to characterize porous rocks. The understanding at the pore scale of reactive and non-reactive transport is being pushed forward by recent developments in both imaging capability - 3D images with resolution of a few microns - and in modeling techniques – flow simulations in giga-cell models.\nWe will present a particle-based method capable of predicting the evolution of petrophysical properties of carbonate cores subjected to CO2 injection at reservoir conditions (i.e. high pressures and temperatures). Reactive flow is simulated directly on the voxels of high resolution micro-CT images of rocks. Reactants are tracked using a semi-analytical streamline tracing algorithm and rock-fluid interaction is controlled by the diffusive flux of particles from the pores to the grains. We study the impact of the flow field heterogeneity and of the injection rate on the sample-averaged (i.e. effective) reaction rate of calcite dissolution in three rocks of increasing complexity: a beadpack, an oolitic limestone and a bioclastic limestone. We show how decreases in the overall dissolution rate depend on both the complexity of the pore space and also on the flow rate. This occurs even in chemically homogenous rocks. Our results suggest that the large differences observed between laboratory and field scale rates could, in part, be explained by the inhomogeneity in the flow field at the pore scale and the consequent transport-limited flux of reactants at the solid surface. Our results give valuable insight into the processes governing carbonate dissolution and provide a starting point to the refinement of upscaling techniques for reactive flows. Potential impacts for reservoir development and monitoring will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Sea level rates up to three times the global mean rate are being observed in the western tropical Pacific since 1993 by satellite altimetry. From recently published studies, it is not yet clear whether the sea level spatial trend patterns of the Pacific Ocean observed by satellite altimetry are mostly due to internal climate variability or if some anthropogenic fingerprint is already detectable. A number of recent studies have shown that the removal of the signal corresponding to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)/ Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) from the observed altimetry sea level data over 1993-2010/2012 results in some significant residual trend pattern in the western tropical Pacific. It has thus been suggested that the PDO/IPO-related internal climate variability alone cannot account for all of the observed trend patterns in the western tropical Pacific and that the residual signal could be the fingerprint of the anthropogenic forcing. In this study, we investigate if there is any other internal climate variability signal still present in the residual trend pattern after the removal of IPO contribution from the altimetry-based sea level over 1993-2013. We show that subtraction of the IPO contribution to sea level trends through the method of linear regression does not totally remove the internal variability, leaving significant signal related to the non-linear response of sea level to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In addition, by making use of 21 CMIP5 coupled climate models, we study the contribution of external forcing to the Pacific Ocean regional sea level variability over 1993- 2013, and show that according to climate models, externally forced and thereby the anthropogenic sea level fingerprint on regional sea level trends in the tropical Pacific is still too small to be observable by satellite altimetry.",

Within the UK there is 650,000 cubic meters of waste safely stored and managed in near-surface interim facilities but with no conclusive permanent disposal route. A Geological Disposal Facility with incorporated Engineered Barrier Systems are currently being considered as a permanent waste management solution (Fig.1).\nThis research focuses on the EBS bentonite buffer/waste canister interface, and experimentally replicates key environmental phases that would occur after canister emplacement. This progresses understanding of the temporal evolution of the EBS and the associated impact on its engineering, mineralogical and physicochemical state and considers any consequences for the EBS safety functions of containment and isolation. Correlation of engineering properties to the physicochemical state is the focus of this research. Changes to geotechnical properties such as Atterberg limits, swelling pressure and swelling kinetics are measured after laboratory exposure to THMC variables from interface and batch experiments. Factors affecting the barrier, post closure, include corrosion product interaction, precipitation of silica, near-field chemical environment, groundwater salinity and temperature.\nResults show that increasing groundwater salinity has a direct impact on the buffer, reducing swelling capacity and plasticity index by up to 80%. Similarly, thermal loading reduces swelling capacity by 23% and plasticity index by 5%. Bentonite/steel interaction studies show corrosion precipitates diffusing into compacted bentonite up to 3mm from the interface over a 4 month exposure (increasing with temperature), with reduction in swelling capacity in the affected zone, probably due to the development of poorly crystalline iron oxides. These results indicate that groundwater conditions, temperature and corrosion may affect the engineering performance of the bentonite buffer such that any interfaces between bentonite blocks that may be present immediately following buffer emplacement may persist in the longer term.",

The results showed that the winter temperature decreased more than 1°C in East China after volcanic eruptions on middle-lower latitudes and equatorial bands. After volcanic eruptions on different latitudes, the temperature spatial patterns were summarized as two types, which included that temperature was cooling centered on Northeast and warming in Tibets, and its opposite pattern. The first pattern was usually detected after equatorial volcanic eruptions in spring/summer and it also appeared after volcanic eruptions on high latitudes in spring/autumn. After middle-lower latitude volcanic eruptions, the variation of geopotential height on 500hPa showed that the positive anomaly was existed at the East of Ural mountain, which caused the temperature decreased in Northwest , Central East and Southeast when east asian trough was intensified. After high latitudes volcanic eruptions, the zonal circulation was more obvious at middle latitudes, the cold air was not easy to transport，therefore winter temperature increased in China except for the Yangtze River Basin. The result of full forcing experiments by CESM showed that temperature decreased at most regions after large volcanic eruptions on equatorial /high bands, and troughs and wedges were developed on 500 hPa. The variation of geopotential height was nearly reversed after volcanic eruptions on high latitudes, only the temperature of Tibetan Plateau decreased. But how the variation of geopotential height regulated the temperature pattern was not clear after equatorial volcanic eruptions.",

The brightness of the feature in visible light is too extreme for auroral emissions to explain, despite its occurrence at a location where these have been previously reported. Likewise, the (projected) altitude of the feature is significantly too high to allow for the local formation of clouds.Fortuitously, the orbit of ESA's Mars Express allowed the measurement of ionospheric plasma density and solar wind parameters over the precise location of the plume sighting at multiple points during this interval.Based on these observations, we tentatively conclude that the formation and/or transport of this plume to the altitudes where it was observed was in part the result of a large Coronal Mass Ejection encountering the Martian system.However, while measurements of ionospheric plasma density at the corresponding altitudes indicate a disturbed structure, this is not a-typical of this location over Mars.

The scientific objectives of the SMOS mission directly respond to the need for global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity, two key variables used in predictive hydrological, oceanographic and atmospheric models. SMOS observations also provide information on the characterisation of ice and snow covered surfaces and the sea ice effect on ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes and dynamics, which affects large-scale processes of the Earth’s climate system.\n The focus of this paper will be on SMOS’s contribution to support water resource management:\nSMOS surface soil moisture provides the input to derive root-zone soil moisture, which in turn provides the input for the drought index, an important monitoring prediction tool for plant available water. \nIn addition to surface soil moisture, SMOS also provides observations on vegetation optical depth. Both parameters aid agricultural applications such as crop growth, yield forecasting and drought monitoring, and provide input for carbon and land surface modelling.\nSMOS data products are used in data assimilation and forecasting systems. Over land, assimilating SMOS derived information has shown to have a positive impact on applications such as NWP, stream flow forecasting and the analysis of net ecosystem exchange. Over ocean, both sea surface salinity and severe wind speed have the potential to increase the predictive skill on the seasonal and short- to medium-range forecast range.\nOperational users in particular in Numerical Weather Prediction and operational hydrology have put forward a requirement for soil moisture data to be available in near-real time (NRT). This has been addressed by developing a fast retrieval for a NRT level 2 soil moisture product based on Neural Networks, which will be available by autumn 2015.\nThis paper will focus on presenting the above applications and used SMOS data products.",

            "abstract": "Previous geophysical, geological and petrological studies suggest a wide range of interactions between tectonic/magmatic processes in a subduction zone and incoming oceanic plate. For example, following a great megathrust earthquake, a large normal-faulting earthquake often occur in an outer- rise region of an incoming plate; the 1933 Meiji-sanriku earthquake (Mw8.1) following the 1896 Meiji-sanriku earthquake (M~8.2) are recognized as typical examples of those doublets in the Japan Trench. Another tectonic process which may control an interaction between processes in subduction interface and incoming plate is hydration/dehydration process of the oceanic plate; i.e., a dehydration process from the subducting oceanic plate is believed to affect various subduction zone processes, including arc volcanism, generation of earthquakes and non-volcanic tremor and inter-plate slow slip. In order to obtain fundamental data for exploring an interaction between a subduction process and an incoming plate, we started a new geophysical project in the outer-rise of the Japan Trench by using an ultra-deep OBS and other active-passive seismological tools. Preliminary results from the outer-rise project show that 1) reduction of Vp and increase of Vp/Vs in the crust and the uppermost mantle from ~150 km seaward of the trench, which is interpreted to be attributed to fluid percolation through bend-related faults, 2) clear Moho reflection of the incoming plate is observed to the trench from the outer-rise with partially obscure Moho reflections, 3) some of clusters of the aftershocks of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, predominantly normal fault aftershocks, extend to deeper in the mantle (~40 km deep) in an area where the Moho reflection is obscure, and the normal fault earthquake became deeper than earthquakes occurred before the 2011 earthquake. Those observations suggest that growing bend-related normal faults can be a primal mechanism to bring water deeper into the oceanic plate and this process may be enhanced by stress change in the incoming/subducting oceanic plate during a large megathrust earthquake. As one of final goals of this project, we expect to obtain an along-trench variation of hydration of the oceanic plate, which may be a factor controlling a variation of plate coupling in a subduction interface.",

            "abstract": "Transport in porous media is frequently simulated via particle methods. These methods formulate transport as a stochastic process of particle position increments. The validity of the formulation is scale dependent. At larger scales, the current particle motion strongly depends on the previous motion. This prohibits the commonly made assumption of independent and normally distributed increments to represent dispersion at larger scales. The dependence is caused by pore-space heterogeneities like fast-flow pore throats or dead-end pores. These characteristics trigger the non-Fickian transport behavior and control the kinetics and scaling of mixing and dilution.\nBased on micro-CT imaging of the pore geometry, we generate two highly realistic velocity fields by solving the Stokes equation at pore scale for two Peclet regimes. Then, a PTRW-based transport simulation is performed to represent transport thoroughly only by advection and diffusion. A modified Pollock algorithm is used to obtain the particle trajectories. Thus, we can simulate and analyze very extensively the complex (non-Fickian) mixing and dilution processes the pore scale.\nWe analyze the temporal evolution of particle pairs. Under non-Fickian conditions, the variance of the two-particle displacements grows non-linearly with time. We also focus on the higher-order moments of the evolving empirical probability distribution as a function of travel time and initial separation. The focus on the high order moments results in a fingerprint of non-Fickian mixing and dilution that includes the full statistics and scale dependence.\nWhile the probability distribution of separation for initially non-separated particles describes dilution, the probability of zero-separation of initially separated particles describes mixing. Further, the probability over time for a first-time encounter of particles at zero separation is a measure for the potential reactivity of the system for mixing-limited bimolecular reactions. ",

            "abstract": "The study of sediments deposited and preserved in oceanic basins unable us to examine how terrigenous sediment supply varied through time in relation to paleoenvironmental and climatic changes on land. The geochemical and isotopic compositions of marine sediment are used to unravel its provenance, and provide information about its formation. Providing that the paleoclimatic frame is known, such data give an insight into the rock-source location and allow us to decipher between genetic processes of mechanical erosion and chemical alteration. Borehole PRGL1-4 (European project PROMESS), located in the Gulf of Lions (W Mediterranean) at 300 mwd, was investigated geochemically at high-temporal resolution over the last glacial/interglacial cycle (i.e. 130 ka) to study sediment-source variations during rapid climate changes. Besides, sediments originating from the Rhône’s and the Pyreneo-Languedocian’s catchment areas have been analyzed to measure the isotopic composition of five source end-members that are the Alps, the Higher Rhône valley, the Lower Rhône valley, the Languedoc and the Pyrenees. Epsilon Nd and 87Sr/86Sr were measured on 60 samples encompassing 4 marine isotopic stages with an emphasis on Heinrich events. The epsilon Nd values of PRGL1-4 lean towards the Lower Rhône valley unradiogenic end-member during cold stadial intervals, and towards the Alpine radiogenic end-member during warm interstadials. The presence of an ice cap over the crystalline Alpine watershed during cold phases could prevent the sediments originating from this region from reaching the Gulf of Lions. The same pattern is observed during the time of Heinrich events. An influence of the sea level variations on the sedimentation at the borehole site during the Heinrich events is unlikely since they are only 10 to 15 m in amplitude. Furthermore, a major isotopic shift in epsilon Nd mean values is displayed around 40 ka that coincides with the connection of the Durance to the Rhône River. We therefore propose that, at this time scale, the major control on sediment’s provenance and composition in the area is related to climatic conditions on land.",

            "abstract": "In this work we propose an innovative approach to assess the geothermal heat flux anomalies in the regions of the Kenyan Rift and the Yellowstone geothermal areas. The method is based on the land surface temperature (LST) differences obtained between remote sensing data and land surface model simulations. The hypothesis is that the model simulations do not account for the subsurface geothermal heat source in the formulation. Remote sensing of surface emitted radiances is able to detect at least the radiative portion of the geothermal signal that is not in the models. Two methods were proposed to assess the geothermal component of LST (LSTgt) based on the aforementioned hypothesis: a physical model and a data mining approach. The LST datasets were taken from the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facilities products over Africa and the Copernicus Programme for North America, at a spatial resolution of 3-5 km. These correspond to Meteosat Second Generation and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system satellites data respectively. The Weather Research and Forecasting model was used to simulate LST based on atmospheric and surface characteristics using the Noah land surface model. The analysis was carried out for a period of two months by using nighttime acquisitions. Higher spatial resolution images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data were also used on the Kenyan area to produce similar outputs employing existing methods. The comparison of the results from both methods and areas illustrated the potential of the data and methodologies for geothermal applications.",

            "abstract": "Ground- and satellite-based measurements reported high concentrations of iodine monoxide (IO) in coastal Antarctica. The sources of such a large iodine burden in the coastal Antarctic atmosphere remain unknown. We propose a mechanism for iodine release from sea-ice based on the premise that micro-algae are the primary source of iodine emissions in this environment. The emissions are triggered by the biological production of iodide (I-) and hypoiodous acid (HOI) from micro-algae (contained within and underneath sea-ice) and their diffusion through sea-ice brine channels, to accumulate in a thin brine layer (BL) on the surface of sea-ice. Prior to reaching the BL, the diffusion timescale of iodine within sea-ice is depth-dependent. The BL is also a vital component of the proposed mechanism as it enhances the chemical kinetics of iodine-related reactions, which allows for the efficient release of iodine to the polar boundary layer. We suggest iodine is released to the atmosphere via 3 possible pathways: (1) emitted from the BL and then transported throughout snow atop sea-ice, to be released to the atmosphere; (2) released directly from the BL to the atmosphere in regions of sea-ice that are not covered with snowpack; or (3) emitted to the atmosphere directly through fractures in the sea-ice pack. To investigate the proposed biology-ice-atmosphere coupling at coastal Antarctica we use a multiphase model that incorporates the transport of iodine species, via diffusion, at variable depths, within brine channels of sea-ice. Model simulations were conducted to interpret observations of elevated springtime IO in the coastal Antarctic, around the Weddell Sea. While a lack of experimental and observational data adds uncertainty to the model predictions, nevertheless the results show that the levels of inorganic iodine (i.e., I2, IBr, ICl) released from sea-ice through this mechanism could account for the observed IO concentrations during this timeframe. The model results also indicate that iodine may trigger the catalytic release of bromine from sea-ice through phase equilibration of IBr. Considering the extent of sea-ice around the Antarctic continent, we suggest that the resulting high levels of iodine may have widespread impacts on catalytic ozone destruction and aerosol formation in the Antarctic lower troposphere.",

Historical and archeological constraints allow a dating precision of better than 10 years.

Archeointensity measurements were performed using the experimental protocol developed for the Triaxe magnetometer. These experiments include an analysis of the cooling rate effect on the studied fragments.

The receiver functions were stacked according to ray piercing points with moveout corrections in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of converted S-to-P phases. The Moho appears at 30-40 km beneath the Rio Grande Rift (RGR) and deepens to 35-45 km beneath the Great Plains (GP) and the Colorado Plateau (CP). A sharp discontinuity is observed along the profile with the average depth of 80 km beneath the RGR, 100 km beneath the GP, and 160 km beneath the CP. This discontinuity is consistent with the top of a low velocity zone in a shear wave model beneath the array and is interpreted as the LAB. Strong phases imaged at ~90 km beneath the CP and GP could be a combination of side-lobes of the Moho conversions and primary Sp phases from a mid-lithosphere discontinuity (MLD). The relatively shallow Moho and LAB beneath the Rio Grande Rift is indicative of lithosphere extension and asthenosphere upwarp. In addition, the LAB shows depth-step depressions at the RGR-CP and RGR-GP boundaries, providing evidence for mantle downwelling. The variation of the lithospheric depth across the RISTRA array supports that edge-driven, small-scale mantle convection is largely responsible for the recent extension and uplift in the Rio Grande Rift and the Colorado Plateau.\n ",

            "abstract": "In 1531, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake with an epicentre inland of Lisbon caused severe damage to the city, rendering a third of its buildings uninhabitable, with its intensity comparable or even greater than the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. This event was followed by a destructive tsunami of slightly smaller size than the 1755 and, in contrast to the latter, it was only observed locally along the entire Tagus estuary and in coastal belt surroundings the mouth of the Tagus River. For the 1531 tsunami, a satisfactory mechanism for its generation has yet to be found, but the inland earthquake epicentre and the absence of large submarine scarps tend to rule out fault-related seabed displacement in and out of the Tagus estuary. An alternative possibility is that the 1531 tsunami was caused by a submarine landslide triggered by the earthquake. Here we describe a submarine landslide along the Cascais Canyon, whose head faces the Tagus estuary, which may have caused the 1531 tsunami. At a depth of around 2000 m, up to 150 m across and 45 m high bocks, erosional furrows and possible gravel waves have been imaged over an area of at least 15 km2 using 30 kHz deep-towed sidescan sonar, suggesting a geologically recent large-scale flow event. High-resolution bathymetry and seafloor photographs acquired at around 4000 m using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the blocky landslide area show boulders at the seafloor, mantled with a thin sediment cover, again suggestive of a recent landslide. Radiocarbon dates from collected cores show that this landslide is likely to have been generated during the 16th century, suggesting a cause-effect relationship with the 1531 earthquake. Preliminary tsunami models suggest that a landslide potentially fitting the characteristics of the Cascais landslide is able to generate a near-field tsunami wave reaching the Lisbon coast but not crossing the whole Tagus estuary. Recognising that the 1531 Lisbon tsunami may have been generated by a submarine landslide along a canyon has important implications for understanding geohazards in SW Europe. Our study suggests that small earthquakes with short recurrence periods can generate tsunamigenic submarine landslides, reinforcing the message that hazard analysis must take this threat into account.",

The magnitude and timing of runoff from these regions is being altered by consecutive years of drought, affecting downstream ecosystems, hydropower operations, and deliveries to agriculture and urban water users. Understanding the long-term effect of drought on the montane water balance requires temporally continuous, in-situ measurements of key hydrologic variables across large spatial domains. We discuss a seven-year dataset from the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory, which includes co-located measurements of snowpack, soil moisture, and soil temperature in the Kings River watershed. We investigate how these key hydrologic variables are affected as the region transitions from winters that have nearly continuous snow cover (2008-2011) to winters with extended snow-on, snow-off periods (2012-2014). For water year 2014, we observe a 93% decline in average snowpack, a 35% decline in average soil moisture, and a 25% increase in average soil temperature compared to a wet-year index of each variable. We discuss the effect of physiographic features, including slope, aspect, elevation, and canopy coverage on the changes observed in each variable.

A major impediment to the large-scale deployment of these networks is the difficulty of finding representative sensor locations and resilient wireless network topologies in complex terrain. Currently, observatories are structured manually in the field, which provides no metric for the number of sensors required for extrapolation, does not guarantee that point measurements are representative of the basin as a whole, and often produces unreliable wireless networks. We present a methodology that combines LiDAR data, pattern recognition, and stochastic optimization to simultaneously identify representative sampling locations, optimal sensor number, and resilient network topologies prior to field deployment. We compare the results of the algorithm to an existing 55-node wireless snow and soil network at the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. Existing data show that the algorithm is able to capture a broader range of key attributes affecting snow and soil moisture, defined by a combination of terrain, vegetation and soil attributes, and thus is better suited to basin-wide monitoring.

In order to estimate the response of the catchment to a given flood event, a conceptual hydrological model is implemented. The measured precipitation values are used as perfect forecast input in the hydrological models. Then, a Kalman filter is implemented and adapted to account for asynchronous streamflow observations coming at irregular time steps having random uncertainty. Synthetic streamflow values are used in this study due to the fact that citizen-based observations are not available.\nThe results show how streamflow observations having variable uncertainty can improve the flood prediction. In particular, increasing the number of observations from low-cost sensors within two model time steps can improve the model accuracy leading to a better flood forecast. Observations uncertainty influences the model accuracy more than the irregular moments in which the streamflow observations are assimilated into the hydrological model.

The suite of EVE rocket instruments is designed for under-flight calibrations of the orbital EVE on SDO. While the sounding rocket EVE instrument is for the most part a duplicate of the EVE on SDO, the SAM channel on the rocket version was modified in 2012 to include a free-standing transmission grating so that it could provide spectrally resolved images of the solar disk with the best signal to noise ratio for the brightest features on it, such as ARs. Calibrations of the EVE sounding rocket instrument at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (NIST SURF) have provided a measurement of the SAM absolute spectral response function and a mapping of wavelength separation in the grating diffraction pattern. For solar observations, this spectral separation is on a similar scale to the spatial size of the AR on the CCD, so dispersed AR images associated with emission lines of similar wavelength tend to overlap. Furthermore, SAM shares a CCD detector with MEGS-A, a separate EVE spectrometer channel, and artifacts of the MEGS-A signal (a set of bright spectral lines) appear in the SAM images. For these reasons some processing and analysis of the solar images obtained by SAM must be performed in order to determine spectra of the observed ARs. We present a method for determining AR spectra from the SAM rocket images and report initial soft X-ray spectra for two of the major active regions (AR11877 and AR11875) observed on flight 36.290 on 21 October 2013 at about 18:30 UT. We also compare our results with concurrent measurements from other solar soft x-ray instrumentation.",

            "abstract": "There is emerging evidence that climate in the North Atlantic-European sector is sensitive to vacillations of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, in particular, the central Pacific flavour of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and concomitant trends in atmospheric heating. The frequency of central Pacific ENSOs appears to have increased over the last decades and some studies suggest it may continue increasing in the future, but the precise mechanisms by which these events affect the North Atlantic synoptic scale circulation are poorly understood. Here, we show that central Pacific ENSOs influence where midlatitude cyclogenesis occurs over the Gulf Stream, producing more cyclogenesis in the jet exit region rather than in the climatologically preferred jet entrance region. The cyclones forming over the Gulf Stream in central Pacific ENSO seasons tend to veer north, penetrating deeper into the Arctic rather than into continental Europe. The shift in cyclogenesis is linked to changes in the large scale circulation, namely, the upper-level trough formed in the lee of the Rocky Mountains.",

Ozone profiles as well stratospheric, tropospheric, lower tropospheric ozone columns are compared with ozonesonde data for different latitude bands, and time periods (e.g., 2004-2008/2009-2014 for without/with row anomaly. The mean biases and their standard deviations are also assessed as a function of time to evaluate the long-term stability and bias trends. In the mid-latitude and tropical regions, OMI generally shows good agreement with ozonesonde observations. The mean ozone profile biases are generally within 6% with up to 30% standard deviations. The biases of stratospheric ozone columns (SOC) and tropospheric ozone columns (TOC) are -0.3%-2.2% and -0.2%-3%, while standard deviations are 3.9%-5.8% and 14.4%-16.0%, respectively. However, the retrievals during 2009-2014 show larger standard deviations and larger temporal variations; the standard deviations increase by ~5% in the troposphere and ~2% in the stratosphere. Retrieval biases at individual levels in the stratosphere and upper troposphere show statistically significant trends and different trends for 2004-2008 and 2009-2014 periods. The trends in integrated ozone partial columns are less significant due to cancellation from various layers, except for significant trend in tropical SOC. These results suggest the need to perform time dependent radiometric calibration to maintain the long-term stability of this product. Similarly, we are comparing the OMI stratospheric ozone profiles and SOC with collocated MLS data, and the results will be reported.",

            "abstract": "Biochar may be a powerful soil amendment to reduce nutrient depletion in North American forests where long-term nitrogen deposition has led to phosphorus (P) limitation, but many effects of biochar in these ecosystems are still unknown. We performed a 12-week growth chamber experiment in which red pine (Pinus resinosa) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings were grown in pots with soil from three Ontario forests and varying amounts of sugar maple biochar. Additionally, biochar effects were compared with the effects of wood ash, a forest biomass bioenergy by-product that may also be a beneficial soil amendment in these ecosystems. We assessed plant biomass, soil microbial biomass and phosphatase activity; additional chemical analyses of plant tissue and soils are ongoing. Biochar effects on seedling growth were not consistent across tree species, soil type, and addition rate. For sugar maple seedlings grown in sand and sandy-loam textured soils, biochar additions of 20 t ha-1 significantly (p = 0.03) decreased root biomass by 25 %, and the root-to-shoot ratio correspondingly declined, but this effect was not observed in a silty soil. For red pine seedlings, the same biochar addition rate slightly increased root biomass. Wood ash effects on biomass were similarly variable. For example, in the sandy soil, sugar maple root biomass was significantly lower after application of 16 t ash ha-1, but unchanged by rates of 4 or 40 t ash ha-1. Microbial biomass and soil phosphatase activity also varied by soil type. Phosphatase activity was significantly lower (p = 0.02) in soils with sugar maple compared to red pine, but there were no consistent biochar or ash effects across all soils and species. However, for red pine seedlings grown in silt, biochar significantly (p = 0.04) reduced the phosphatase activity compared to the control and ash soils. Overall, biochar may lessen P-limitation in forested ecosystems, but the suitability of biochar, and wood ash, for increasing P uptake and consequently growth of tree seedlings is highly dependent on the species, soil, and application rate.",

Ultimately, these models will be used for characterizing explosions, which can occur with a variety of yields, depths of burial, and in complex media. To accomplish this, controlled chemical explosions were conducted in a granite outcrop at the Nevada Nuclear Security Test Site. These explosions were monitored with extensive seismic and infrasound instrumentation both in the near and far-field. Utilizing this data, we calculate predictions before the explosions occur and iteratively improve our models after each explosion. Specifically, we use an adjoint-based full waveform inversion code that employs discontinuous Galerkin techniques to predict waveforms at station locations prior to the fifth explosion in the series (SPE5). The full-waveform inversions are performed using a realistic geophysical model based on local 3D tomography and inversions for media properties using previous shot data. The code has capabilities such as unstructured meshes that align with material interfaces, local polynomial refinement, and support for various physics and methods for implicit and explicit time-integration. The inversion results we show here evaluate these different techniques, which allows for model fidelity assessment (acoustic versus elastic versus anelastic, etc.). In addition, the accuracy and efficiency of several time-integration methods can be determined.

            "abstract": "Highly resolved characterization of the spatial distribution of aquifer properties is critical for the accurate prediction of groundwater flow and transport. Here, we test the value of using full-waveform inversion of cross-borehole ground penetrating radar (GPR) data for alluvial aquifer characterization. Our study is carried out at the Krauthausen test site, where several field and modelling studies, conducted over the last decades, have yielded a rich set of information that provides excellent opportunities to test and validate novel methods. We apply a full-waveform inversion to analyze GPR data acquired along 15 individual tomographic crosshole planes. By stitching together the tomographic images for adjacent crosshole planes, we are able to image the spatial distribution of subsurface electrical properties (dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity) at the decimeter scale along transects of several tens of meters length. Although each crosshole plane was inverted separately, consistent spatial structures in the tomographic images are obtained where planes intersect, which indicates robust inversion results. The GPR results are confirmed by independent direct-push porosity logs, which show a strong correlation with porosity estimates derived from GPR using the Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM). Compared with traditional ray-based inversion techniques, which are limited in resolution, the full-waveform inversion is found to improve the reconstruction of abrupt changes and fine-scale variations in porosity. Based on the GPR results, additional cone penetration tests (CPT) and direct-push injection logs (DPIL) have recently been measured at selected crosshole plane locations. Preliminary comparison with the GPR results indicates that the spatial variations in GPR permittivity and electrical conductivity match the major changes in lithology and hydraulic conductivity obtained from CPT and DPIL. In conclusion, our study suggests that full-waveform inversion of crosshole GPR data can be used to map lithological changes in alluvial aquifers at the field scale with a spatial resolution at the decimeter scale. In particular, the combination of GPR with complementary direct-push investigation tools appears to be a promising strategy for alluvial aquifer characterization.",

NASA’s ACCESSII mission focusses on aircraft emissions and initial stages of contrail formation. Nascent contrails were detected at cruise altitudes near 100 m distance to the engine exit. Contrail growth to 10-min contrail age is investigated during DLR’s CONCERT campaigns. Finally, the objective of ML-CIRRUS with the HALO research aircraft is to study the life cycle and climate impact of contrail cirrus with a novel in-situ/remote sensing payload. The contrail measurements are related to previous observations and discussed in the context of recent developments in contrail modeling.

Participants then use these tools to develop inquiry-based activities to teach their K-12 students how the scientific method and data are used to understand the effects of global climate change. The summer portion of the program takes teachers from throughout Ohio to the Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina. There they engage in a physical and biological exploration of the modern and ancient ocean. For example, they collect samples of sediment and test water samples collected from modern coastal environments and connect their findings with evidence of the fauna living in those environments. Then, using observations from the geological record of the Eocene through Pleistocene sediments exposed in eastern North Carolina and inferences from observations made from the modern ocean they seek to answer scientifically testable questions regarding the physical and biological characteristics of the ocean during Cenozoic climate change events. During the academic year participants connect with each other and project faculty online to support the development of inquiry based science activities for their K-12 students. These activities focus on how evidence and observations such as outcrop extent, sediment type and biological assemblages can be used to infer past climates. The activities are taught in participant’s classrooms and discussed with other participants in an online discussion space. Assessment of both teachers and K-12 students document significant positive changes in science knowledge, their confidence in being able to do science and a clearer understanding of how oceans are impacted by global climate change.",

            "abstract": "Elasticity is a material property that reflects the atomic structure and interatomic forces in crystalline materials. As a result, elastic properties are strongly affected by changes in pressure and temperature. In Earth Sciences, knowledge of the elastic behavior of geomaterials at pressure and temperature conditions of the Earth’s interior is key to constrain our planet’s inner structure and dynamics through forward modelling of seismic observables. Here, we will discuss internally consistent single-crystal elasticity measurements that combine the opportunities emerging from the recent development of combined Brillouin scattering (to derive acoustic wave velocities) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) systems (for structure and unit-cell parameter determination) with the advantages of sophisticated sample preparation using the focused ion beam (FIB) technique [1]. We will show results of experiments on mantle minerals that were performed using the combined Brillouin scattering and rotating anode XRD system at the Bayerisches Geoinstitut BGI. Multiple single-crystals, FIB-tailored in size and shape, were loaded in the single sample chambers of resistively-heated diamond-anvil cells (DAC). Such a multi-sample approach allows for internally consistent determinations of all independent elastic constants from low-symmetry crystals by Brillouin spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Furthermore, the multi-sample approach facilitates direct quantification of the effects of chemical substitution on the structure and elasticity of high-symmetry crystals at non-ambient conditions. Our experimental approach eliminates uncertainties arising from the combination of data collected under (potentially) different conditions in several DAC runs, in different laboratories and/or from using different pressure-temperature sensors. We will also discuss the possibility to derive pressure independent from a secondary pressure scale.\n[1] H. Marquardt, K. Marquardt, Am. Mineral. 97, 299-304 (2012).",

The impact of land cover degradation is quantified using two different approaches of experimental design: in the 1st approach, the RCM land cover degradation experiment shares the same LBCs as the corresponding RCM control, which can be derived from either reanalysis data or a GCM; with the 2nd approach, the LBCs for the RCM control are derived from a GCM control, and the LBCs for the RCM land cover degradation experiment are derived from a corresponding GCM land cover degradation experiment. When the 1st approach is used, results from the RCM driven with the three different sources of LBCs are generally consistent with each other, indicating robustness of the model response against LBCs; when the 2nd approach is used, the RCM results show strong sensitivity to the source of LBCs and the response in the RCM is dominated by the response of the driving GCMs. The spatiotemporal pattern of the precipitation response to land cover degradation as simulated by RCM using the 1st approach closely resembles that of the observed historical changes, while results from the GCMs and the RCM using the 2nd approach bear less similarity to observations. Compared with the 1st approach, the 2nd approach has the advantage of capturing the impact on large scale circulation, but has the disadvantage of being influenced by the GCMs’ internal variability and any potential erroneous response of the driving GCMs to land degradation. The 2nd approach therefore requires a large ensemble to reduce the uncertainties derived from the driving GCMs.",

            "abstract": "UV/Vis satellite retrievals of trace gas columns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO) are useful to test and improve models of atmospheric composition, for data assimilation, and to provide top-down constraints on emissions. However, because models and satellite measurements do not represent the exact same geophysical quantities, the process of confronting model fields with satellite measurements is complicated by representativeness errors, which degrade the quality of the comparison beyond contributions from modelling and measurement errors alone. Here we discuss representativeness errors that arise from the act of carrying out a model-satellite comparison: (1) horizontal representativeness errors due to imperfect collocation of the model grid cell and an ensemble of satellite pixels called superobservation, (2) temporal representativeness errors originating mostly from differences in cloud cover between the modelled and observed state, and (3) vertical representativeness errors because of reduced satellite sensitivity towards the surface. To minimize the impact of these representativeness errors, models and satellite measurements should be sampled as consistent as possible, and we provide recipes to do so. A practical confrontation of tropospheric NO2 columns simulated by the TM5 CTM with OMI tropospheric NO2 retrievals suggests that horizontal representativeness errors are <5-10% in most cases and of random nature. These errors should be included along with the individual retrieval errors in the overall superobservation error. Temporal sampling errors from mismatches in cloud cover, and in photolysis rates, are on the order of 10% for NO2 and HCHO, and systematic, but partly avoidable. In the case of air pollution applications where sensitivity down to the ground is required, models should be sampled on the same mostly cloud-free days as the satellite retrievals. The most relevant representativeness error is associated with the vertical sensitivity of UV/Vis satellite retrievals. Simple vertical integration of modelled profiles leads to systematically different model columns compared to application of the appropriate averaging kernel. In comparing OMI NO2 to GEOS-Chem NO2 simulations, these systematic differences are as large as 15-20%.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of bank erosion processes and rates along very large rivers remains incomplete, primarily due to the difficulties of obtaining morphological and flow data close to the bank across various flow stages. Moreover, obtaining such process information through the entire flow and bank depth has also proved challenging. Here, we present data from a series of high spatial resolution topographic (Terrestrial Laser Scanner and Multibeam Echo Sounder) and flow (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) surveys undertaken on the Mekong River, Cambodia, which reveal the temporal and spatial evolution of a series of embayments on the outer bank of a large meander. These techniques yield unique data that reveal how the flow field responds to the morphology of the outer bank and subaqueous slump blocks. Specifically, we show that in the early stage of embayment growth, deposited slump blocks induce flow upwelling and bank-directed flow that enhances bank erosion. Our data also suggest that as the initial erosion process continues, a threshold embayment size is reached. Below this threshold, flow separation acts to enhance embayment growth along with the fluid dynamic effects of slump blocks, but above the threshold size, the separation zone in the embayments acts as a protective layer, thus slowing erosion. This field data allows proposition of a new conceptual model of embayment evolution.",

            "abstract": "The recovering of the release history of a pollutant in an aquifer is a subject that obtains the researchers attention since 1990 because the knowledge of the pollutant discharge history can be a useful tool to share, among the responsible parties, the costs of the remediation actions. The methods developed are based on the perfect knowledge of the flow field where the pollutant event has occurred. But very often this perfect knowledge is only an unattainable hope: few boreholes and pumping tests are usually available and realizing new ones can lead to unacceptable costs.\nAn evaluation of the reliability of the results obtained with the procedures for the recovering of the release history in heterogeneous and partially known flow field can be a very useful subject under the point of view of researchers and the practitioners. In fact the different methods can be more or less sensitive to the problem or give information that includes or not an uncertainty evaluation; moreover it can be possible to quantify the adequate amount of the site characterization actions.\nIn this work we deal with a geostatistically based approach that in the past we have successfully applied on a perfect-known transmissivity field. The objective of the actual study is to investigate the importance of the knowledge of the hydraulic conductivity field and to identifying the minimum information required for recovering an acceptable release history. At this aim we built a numerical model of a 2-D confined aquifer with rectangular shape characterized by a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field. We estimate the conductivity field through a kriging interpolation starting from values sampled on a regular grids of different density and on that partially known field we estimate the pollutant release history. The results show that the reliability of the recovered release history, of course, increases with the density of the grid but meaningful indications can be obtained also with not very detailed discretization.",

            "abstract": "To measure time-dependent deformation at the Brady Hot Springs geothermal field in western Nevada, we analyze interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired between 2004 and 2014 by five satellite missions, including: ERS-2, Envisat, ALOS, TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X. The resulting maps of deformation show an elliptical subsiding area that is ~4 km by ~1.5 km. Its long axis coincides with the strike of the dominant normal-fault system at Brady. Within this bowl of subsidence, the interference pattern shows several smaller features with length scales of the order of ~1 km. This signature occurs consistently in all of the well-correlated interferometric pairs spanning several months. Results from inverse modeling suggest that the deformation is a result of volumetric contraction in shallow units, no deeper than 600 m, that are probably associated with damaged regions where faults interact via thermal (T), hydrological (H), mechanical (M), and chemical (C) processes. Such damaged zones are expected to extend downward along steeply dipping fault planes, providing high-permeability conduits to the production wells. Using time series analysis, we test the hypothesis that geothermal production drives the observed deformation. We find a good correlation between the observed deformation rate and the rate of production in the shallow wells. We explore first-order models to calculate the time-dependent deformation fields produced by coupled processes, including: thermal contraction of rock (T-M coupling), decline in pore pressure (H-M coupling), and dissolution of minerals over time (H-C-M coupling). These processes are related to the heterogeneity of hydro-geological and material properties at the site.

            "abstract": "A total of 993 pairs of shear wave splitting parameters obtained using the SKS, SKKS and PKS phases recorded by 183 broadband seismic stations in northeast China demonstrate systematic spatial and azimuthal variations, and therefore provide important constraints on the characteristics of mantle deformation and the direction of asthenospheric flow. Most of the fast orientations are consistent with the relative motion direction between the Erasian and Pacific plates. Results of anisotropy depth analyses suggest that the observed anisotropy mostly resides in the lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling area. Based on the splitting measurements and previous seismic tomography studies, we propose a model in which the observed anisotropy is mainly controlled by mantle flow resulting from the northwestwards subduction of the Pacific plate beneath Eurasia. For some local areas, anisotropy might be related to different mechanisms, including a possible tearing of the Pacific plate that leads to the splitting parameters observed beneath the Jiamusi massif, partial lithospheric delamination beneath the Songliao Basin, and two-layer anisotropic structure in the vicinity of the Yanshan belt.",

            "abstract": "Recent works have interpreted accelerated and extreme sea level (SL) changes along the northeast coast of North America primarily in terms of dynamic changes related to the meridional overturning or coastal circulations. Isostatic changes related to surface atmospheric pressure loading —the inverted barometer (IB) effect— have been deemed relatively unimportant, but a comprehensive analysis of the IB effect has been lacking. In this work, we use five different atmospheric pressure products to analyze the influence of the IB effect on annual mean SL from tide gauge records. Consistently across all products, the IB effect accounts for about 50% of the magnitude of a recent extreme event of SL rise in 2009 along Atlantic Canada and New England. In fact, the unique nature of the event was largely a result of the extreme IB signal. Estimated IB effects also amount to about 10–30% of recent multidecadal SL accelerations over the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England. These findings reiterate the need for careful estimation of IB effects for studies that want to interpret observed SL in terms of dynamic ocean circulation changes.",

            "abstract": "The axial melt lens is a steady-state, generally magma-rich body located at the dyke-gabbro transition at mid-crustal levels beneath intermediate- and fast-spreading ridges. It is widely believed to be the reservoir from which mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) erupts. Using a remotely-operated vehicle, cruise JC21 to the Hess Deep Rift recovered the first comprehensive sample suite of the uppermost plutonics from a fast-spreading ridge. We present the results of a detailed microanalytical investigation of 23 samples (8 dolerites, 14 gabbronorites, and 1 gabbro) recovered by ROV dive 78 from a section traversing the transition from the uppermost gabbros into the sheeted dykes. With the exception of a single olivine-bearing sample (78R-6), dive 78 is dominated by evolved, varitextured (both in hand sample and thin section) oxide gabbronorites. Full thin section quantitative element maps were acquired on serial thin sections from each sample using the analytical scanning electron microscope in the at Cardiff University. The resulting maps were post-processed in MatlabTM to determine the full distribution of plagioclase compositions across entire thin sections (typically 500,000 analyses per sample); an approach we term ‘quantitative assessment of compositional distribution’ (QACD). By so doing we are able to conduct the first fully rigorous assessment of gabbro compositions, and, by extension, melt compositions present at this level beneath the ridge axis. Critically, we only found 2 grains of high-An plagioclase (An>80) in all of the samples (N = 51). These occur as cores within a sample dominated by lower-An plagioclase. Instead, the vast majority (75%) of plagioclase within the samples have compositions of An65 or lower; compositions too evolved to be in equilibrium with MORB. The most primitive sample, 78R-6, is an olivine-bearing gabbronorite with Fo67 olivine, and plagioclase ranging from An52-77 (median An = 65). These data are difficult to reconcile with models in which primitive melts fed from the mantle reside in the melt lens and crystallize significant gabbroic material. If MORB was sourced from the melt lens at Hess Deep, the paucity of primitive compositions in the upper plutonics suggests that their residence time may be sufficiently limited to prevent substantial crystallization.",

            "abstract": "Exhumation of mantle derived rocks at the seafloor is common at slow spreading ridges, and is observed or inferred in the distal parts of many divergent continental margins (Ocean Continent transition-OCT). It is therefore a fundamental plate tectonic process. It involves large normal fault displacements, and has consequences in terms of magmatic and hydrothermal processes, two parameters that (with divergence rates) control the thermal evolution of the plate boundary. Mantle exhumation may also favor specific deep seafloor ecosystems (hydrogen and methane produced during serpentinization may be used as a fuel for microbial activity). Key questions at both slow-spreading ridges and OCTs are: how do exhumation faults work? how deep does serpentinization extend? and what is the proportion between serpentinized mantle and intrusive magmatic rocks within the seismic crust?\nIn order to address these questions, and to characterise the nature of oceanic crust formed in an amagmatic section of an ultra-slow spreading ridge, we acquired 3D seismic reflection and refraction data across the South West Indian Ridge at 64.3°E in October 2014 aboard R/V Marion-Dufresne. The study area is a corridor of nearly amagmatic spreading, where previous sampling indicates that continuous tectonic exhumation of mantle-derived peridotites occurred over the past 8-10myrs (Sauter et al., Nature Geosc. 2013). We used a 4.5 km long streamer and 38 ocean bottom seismometers in 56 deployment. Our cruise was designed to characterize velocity-depth profiles and Vp/Vs ratio in variably serpentinized ultramafic basement, their lateral variability, and the differences between axial and off-axis areas, as well as the seismic reflectivity structure in exhumed ultramafic domains. We also aimed to image the active detachment fault responsible for on-going mantle rocks exhumation at the ridge. In this poster presentation, we provide details on the experimental setting, and an overview of the results of preliminary processing of the data. These indicate that the seismic crust is thin and comprises an uppermost layer of very low velocity overlying a higher velocities domain. The seismic crust and the underlying mantle show several reflectors that could be interpreted as faults, magmatic injections or contrasted degrees of serpentinization.",

The Deriving Information on Surface conditions from COlumn and VERtically resolved observations relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) 2011 field campaign, which took place in the Baltimore-Washington DC region, offered a unique opportunity to study boundary layer processes in an urban area using a geographically dense collection of surface-based lidar systems (see figure).\nLidars use aerosols as tracers for atmospheric boundary layer dynamics with high vertical and temporal resolutions. In this study, we use data from two permanent Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) sites and five field deployed Micropulse lidar (MPL) systems in order to observe spatiotemporal variations in the daytime mixed layer height. We present and compare lidar-derived retrievals of the mixed layer height using two different methods. The first method uses the wavelet covariance transform and a “fuzzy logic” attribution scheme in order to determine the mixed layer height. The second method uses an objective approach utilizing a time-adaptive extended Kalman filter. Independent measurements of the boundary layer height are obtained using profiles from ozonesonde launches at the Beltsville and Edgewood sites for comparison with lidar observations.",

This OMZ causes oxygen-deficient water entering the photic layer and affecting plankton communities having low tolerance to hypoxia. Variable, and usually species-dependent, responses of zooplankton to hypoxia condition can be found. Most dominant species avoid hypoxia by restricting their vertical distribution, while others can temporarily enter and even spent part of their life cycle within the OMZ. Whatever the case, low-oxygen conditions appear to affect virtually all vital rates of zooplankton, such as mortality, fecundity, development and growth and metabolism, and early developmental stages seem more sensitive, with significant consequences for population and community dynamics. For most study cases, these effects are negative at individual and population levels. Observations and predictions upon increasing upwelling intensity over the last 20-30 years indicate a gradual shoaling of the OMZ, and so that an expected enhancement of these negative effects of hypoxia on the zooplankton community.

In particular, engineering design needs quantitative estimates of probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) values for the future in order to optimize runoff control structures for future climate conditions. This can be realized by simply analyzing the precipitation data from global climate model simulations of the future. However, confidence in the resulting values suffers from the known issues with GCM simulation of precipitation. In addition, skepticism about the accuracy of climate models negatively affects potential adoption of revised values in the engineering design community. We contend that scientists need a multi-pronged approach to develop PMP/IDF values that can be defended, explained, and promoted in order to maximize societal benefits and avoid catastrophic events. This talk will discuss considerations that could/should form the basis for design values. While global-warming induced increases in atmospheric water vapor content are nearly certain and form the foundation for expected increases in extreme precipitation, they most likely will be modulated by changes in global atmospheric dynamics and the consequent effects on local weather system climatology. This can be seen currently in the unexplained regional variations in recent trends in extreme precipitation frequency and intensity. We need to be able to understand recent trends, when greenhouse gas forcing of the climate systems has been rapidly increasing, in order to produce confident projections of future extreme precipitation.",

            "abstract": "After more than four years in orbit about Mercury, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft impacted the planet’s surface north of Shakespeare crater (54.44° N, 210.12° E,) on 30 April 2015.\nOne of the main goals of the mission was to determine the gravity field of Mercury in order to learn about Mercury’s interior. Together with ground-based radar measurements of the obliquity and forced librations, MESSENGER-derived gravity models helped revise models of Mercury’s interior. Nevertheless, the refinement of Mercury’s orientation with the latest data from MESSENGER can further improve the interior modeling of the planet. The last eight months of the mission provided a special opportunity to conduct low-altitude measurements, with extensive radio tracking coverage below 200 km altitude north of ~30°N.\nMESSENGER’s Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) mapped the topography of Mercury’s northern hemisphere with a sub-meter vertical precision, an along-track sampling of ~500 m, and a longitudinal resolution (~0.1°) limited by the number of spacecraft orbits (~4,000). The combination of gravity and topography helps determine crustal thickness and interior properties. Altimetric ranges provide geodetic constraints to improve the spacecraft orbit determination, and thus the gravity field model. In particular, whereas the MESSENGER spacecraft was not tracked at each periapsis passage, MLA operated nearly continuously (outside of thermally challenging periods). From an analysis of the entire radiometric and altimetric datasets acquired by MESSENGER, a new gravity field to degree and order 100 has been obtained, resolving features down to ~75 km horizontal scale. The altimetric data help reduce the uncertainties in the determination of the pole position. A reanalysis of the Mercury flybys also constrains the spin rate over the longest available time span.",

We present a new selected global dataset (PSV10) of paleodirectional data spanning the last 10 Ma. We include all results calculated with modern laboratory methods, regardless of site VGP colatitude, that meet statistically derived selection criteria. We exclude studies that target transitional field states or identify significant tectonic effects, and correct for any bias from serial correlation by averaging directions from sequential lava flows. PSV10 has an improved global distribution compared with previous compilations, comprising 1519 sites from 71 studies. VGP dispersion in PSV10 varies with latitude, exhibiting substantially higher values in the southern hemisphere than at corresponding northern latitudes. Inclination anomaly estimates at many latitudes are within error of an expected GAD field, but significant negative anomalies are found at equatorial and mid-northern latitudes. Current PSV models Model G and TK03 do not fit observed PSV or TAF latitudinal behavior in PSV10, or subsets of normal and reverse polarity data, particularly for southern hemisphere sites. Attempts to fit these observations with simple modifications to TK03 showed slight statistical improvements, but still exceed acceptable errors. The root-mean-square misfit of TK03 (and subsequent iterations) is substantially lower for the normal polarity subset of PSV10, compared to reverse polarity data. Two-thirds of data in PSV10 are normal polarity, most which are from the last 5 Ma, so we develop a new TAF model using this subset of data. We use the resulting TAF model to explore whether new statistical PSV models can better describe our new global compilation.",

The Mw 8.6 and Mw 8.2 strike-slip intraplate earthquakes on 11 April 2012, while clearly occurring in the equatorial Indian Ocean diffuse plate boundary zone, are a case in point, with disagreement on the nature of the focal mechanisms and the faults that ruptured. We use bathymetric and seismic reflection data from the rupture area of the earthquakes in the northern Wharton Basin to demonstrate pervasive brittle deformation between the Ninetyeast Ridge and the Sunda subduction zone. In addition to evidence of recent strike-slip deformation along approximately north-south–trending fossil fracture zones, we identify a new type of deformation structure in the Indian Ocean: conjugate Riedel shears limited to the sediment section and oriented oblique to the north-south fracture zones. The Riedel shears developed in the Miocene, at a similar time to the onset of diffuse deformation in the central Indian Ocean. However, left-lateral strike-slip reactivation of existing fracture zones started earlier, in the Paleocene to early Eocene, and compartmentalizes the Wharton Basin. Modeled rupture during the 11 April 2012 intraplate earthquakes is consistent with the location of two reactivated, closely spaced, approximately north-south–trending fracture zones. However, we find no evidence for WNW-ESE–trending faults in the shallow crust, which is at variance with most of the earthquake fault models.",

            "abstract": "The paleogeographic evolution of the late Neoproterozoic and early Phanerozoic is dominated by the dispersion of Rodinia and the assembly of Gondwana. The timing of these two episodes is still highly debated, partly due to the low number of good quality paleomagnetic data. In order to better constrain the paleogeography for this epoch, we bring new paleomagnetic data on volcanic series from the West African Craton (WAC), which is a key block to understand the evolution of these two supercontinents.\nWe have sampled well dated pyroclastic and lava flows from the groups of Ouarzazate (upper Ediacaran) and Taroudant (lower Cambrian) in the Anti-Atlas (Morocco). 500 samples from 105 sites were thermally demagnetized in laboratory. Our results highlight two major groups of directions, mainly carried by minerals of the titano-hematite family. Magnetite may also contribute sometimes to the magnetization. The first group displays a single polarity direction, with a shallow inclination and a south-east declination. This direction close to the expected direction derived from the Permo-Carboniferous segment of the Gondwana apparent polar wander path (APWP) is due to a remagnetization acquired during the Kiaman reversed polarity superchron (320-262Ma). The second group, observed in the Ouarzazate and Taroudant groups, consists of a dual polarity high inclination direction and may represent the characteristic magnetization.\nOn the basis of geologic and paleomagnetic data from literature, we constructed an APWP for both WAC and Amazonia between 615 and 530Ma, assuming these two blocks were already accreted. We found a paleomagnetic solution in which Laurentia and WAC-Amazonia remained attached from ~615Ma up to the late Ediacaran, Laurentia remaining at low latitude during this period. Around ~550Ma, WAC-Amazonia separated from Laurentia and finally collided with the other Gondwanan blocks during the lower Cambrian, marking the final accretion of Gondwana.",

The relative humidity sensor has recently been recalibrated (June 2015), providing relative humidity values slightly lower than those in the previous release (Dec 2014). Here we only use relative humidity data obtained with the latest recalibration parameters.\nWe find that the most likely frost events occurred at four different locations: Dingo Gap during sols 529-535, an unnamed place during sols 554-560, Kimberley during sols 609-617, and an unnamed place during sols 673-676. At these four locations, the terrain features thermal inertia of ~200 SI units, a value much lower than that of 365 ± 50 SI units obtained from satellite measurements at the landing ellipse. We estimate a maximum thickness of the frost layer likely developed at these four locations of the order of tenths of μm, with the precipitable water content (PWC) showing values of a few pr-μm.\nSince water vapor pressure values derived from REMS measurements present high uncertainties during the daytime, the day-to-night variability in the near-surface water content at Gale cannot be analyzed using only REMS products. By comparing the nighttime PWC values obtained from REMS with the daytime PWC values obtained from satellite, we estimate a day-to-night ratio of the near-surface water vapor pressure at Gale of about 5.",

The Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) dataset of rainwater and water vapor isotopes are predominantly based on continental observations, with very limited observation available from the oceanic area. Stable isotope ratios in precipitation provide valuable means to understand the process of evaporation and transport of water vapor. This is further extended in the study of past changes in climate from the isotopic composition of ice core. In this study we present latitudinal variability of water vapor and rainwater isotopic composition and compared it with factors like physical condition of sea surface water from near equator (1°S) to the polar front (56°S) during the summer time expedition of the year 2013. The water vapor and rainwater isotopes showed a sharp depletion in isotopes while progressively move southward from the tropical regions (i.e. >30°S), which follows the pattern recorded in the surface ocean water isotopic composition. From the tropics to the southern latitudes, the water vapor d18O varied between -11.8‰ to -14.7‰ while dD variation ranges between -77.7‰ to -122.2‰. Using the data we estimated the expected water vapor isotopic composition under kinetic as well as equilibrium process. Our observation suggests that the water vapor isotopic compositions are in equilibrium with the sea water in majority of cases. At one point of observation, where trajectory of air parcel originated from the continental region, we observed a large deviation from the existing trend of latitudinal variability. The deduced rainwater composition adopting equilibrium model showed a consistent pattern with observed values at the tropical region, while role of kinetic process become dominant on progressive shift towards the southern latitudes. We will draw comparison of our observation with other data available in the literature together with isotope model data during the presentation.",

The satellite and surface aerosol observations were anti-correlated with three drought indicators (i.e., MODIS vegetation index, a European satellite soil moisture dataset, and Palmer Drought Severity Index). During the dusty year of 2007, we show that the dust events were stronger and more frequent in the afternoon hours than in the morning due to faster winds and drier soil, and the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts were important dust source regions during identified dust events in Phoenix as indicated by NOAA’s Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model calculations. Based on these findings, we suggested a potential for use of satellite soil moisture and vegetation index products to interpret and predict dust activity. We also emphasized the importance of using hourly observations for better capturing dust events, and expect the hourly geostationary satellite observations in the future to well complement the current surface PM and meteorological observations considering their broader spatial coverage. Additionally, the performance of the National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC) 12 km CMAQ model simulation is evaluated during a recent strong dust event in the western US accompanied by stratospheric ozone intrusion. The current modeling system well captured the temporal variability and the magnitude of aerosol concentrations during this event. Directions of integrating satellite weather and vegetation observations into the dust emission modeling to further improve dust emission modeling in CMAQ are also suggested.",

            "abstract": "The down-dip geometry of seismically active normal faults is not well known. Many examples of normal faults with down-dip curvature exist, such as listric faults revealed in cross-section or in seismic reflection data, or the exposed domes of core complexes. However, it is not understood: (1) whether curved faults fail in earthquakes, and (2) if those faults have generated earthquakes, is the curvature a primary feature of the rupture or due to later modification of the plane? Even if an event is surface-rupturing, because of the limited depth-extent over which observations can be made, it is difficult to reliably constrain the change in dip with depth (if any) and therefore the fault curvature. Despite the uncertainty in seismogenic normal fault geometries, published slip inversions most commonly use planar fault models.\nWe investigate the seismological constraints on normal fault geometry using a forward-modelling approach and present a seismological technique for determining down-dip geometry. We demonstrate that complexity in the shape of teleseismic body waveforms may be used to investigate the presence of down-dip fault plane curvature. We have applied this method to a catalogue of continental and oceanic normal faulting events. Synthetic models demonstrate that the shapes of SH waveforms at along-strike stations are particularly sensitive to fault plane geometry. It is therefore important to consider the azimuthal station coverage before modelling an event. We find that none of the data require significant down-dip curvature, although the modelling results for some events remain ambiguous. In some cases we can constrain that the down-dip fault geometry is within 20° of planar.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian dust is an important physical and chemical flux to mountain snowpack, with potentially significant contributions of trace metals and solutes to mountain streams during snowmelt. However, it is difficult to differentiate element contributions from dust relative to inputs from soil erosion and weathering. Sr isotopes show promise as a tracer of the soluble fraction of dust from snowpack to snowmelt runoff. We analyzed 87Sr/86Sr ratios, Sr and trace metal concentrations, and other parameters in bulk snowpack (wet and dry deposition), dust, and snowmelt runoff in the upper Provo River watershed in the Uinta Mountains (Utah, USA) over three years (2013-2015). In 2014 snowpack and dust samples had the same 87Sr/86Sr ratio (~0.7110), indicating that dust was responsible for the majority of Sr deposition to snowpack. Preliminary results using a two end-member mixing model (end-members of bulk snowpack and river baseflow) indicate that dust contributed up to 40% of Sr riverine load during peak runoff in 2014. In contrast, in 2013 there were no visible dust layers in the snowpack and mixing models indicate a different Sr source (e.g., soil water). Analyses are still underway on the 2015 samples. Sequential leaching experiments on dust samples suggest that Sr is likely associated with the highly soluble carbonate mineral fraction in dust, but other elements such as Cr, Cu, Pb, and U are associated with the relatively insoluble organic fraction. Additional work is underway to investigate transport of the less soluble dust-borne metals during snowmelt by complexation with organic matter or other mechanisms. These results suggest that dust on snowpack is an important but variable source of soluble elements during snowmelt, and that dust should be considered when investigating solute loads in mountain streams.",

            "abstract": "Plant productivity is often limited by low N availability, and this has been attributed to the slow breakdown of N-containing polymers such as proteins into amino acids that are small enough for uptake. Under such conditions, plants and microorganisms efficiently use the available N for growth, and the microbial release of excess N as ammonium (N mineralization), as well as the transformation of ammonium into nitrate (nitrification) is low. Nitrogen limitation is expected to increase towards high latitudes as conditions become less favourable for decomposition. On the other hand, within an ecosystem, microbial N limitation is expected to decrease with soil depth, following the decrease in the C/N ratio of organic matter. To test these hypotheses, we sampled organic topsoils, mineral topsoils and mineral subsoils from seven ecosystems along a latitudinal transect in Western Siberia, ranging from tundra (67°N) to boreal forest and further to steppe (54°N), and determined gross rates of protein depolymerization, N mineralization and nitrification using 15N pool dilution assays. We found that all rates decreased with depth following the decrease in organic matter content. Related to microbial biomass, however, only protein depolymerization decreased with depth, whereas N mineralization and nitrification significantly increased. This pattern was consistent across the seven ecosystems studied. Furthermore, we did not find indications for a decrease in microbial N limitation from arctic to temperate systems. Our findings thus challenge the perception of ubiquitous N limitation at high latitudes, but suggest a transition from N to C limitation of microorganisms with soil depth. With microbial N immobilization constrained by low C availability, subsoils might harbour an easily available N pool that can contribute to plant N nutrition, but might also promote N losses from the ecosystem, e.g., by nitrate leaching, even in high latitude systems such as tundra and boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "A zone of dead trees and bare ground near Horseshoe Lake on the southeast flank of Mammoth Mountain in California is attributed to high emissions of volcanic CO2 and has been characterized and studied since the 1990s. Measurements of diffuse CO2 emissions have been made since 1994, but tree kills occurred following a large earthquake swarm in 1989 and before these first measurements. In order to track vegetation changes over time, fifteen aerial images of the Horseshoe Lake tree kill from 1951 to 2014 were analyzed using photogrammetric techniques which allow us to quantify the extent of bare ground and provide an indirect analysis of tree mortality, possibly related to CO2 emissions.\nThe aerial images were assigned a uniform spatial reference, then image pixels were classified into two main categories, trees or bare ground, and the aerial extent quantified using the GIS software ArcMap. Between 1951 and 1987, there was little change in area of bare ground or tree density near Horseshoe Lake. The tree kill area appeared in 1992 and expanded rapidly to about 0.20 km2 by 1998, which is similar to its present extent. In images from 2012 and onward, a large increase in bare ground was identified and correlated with a powerful windstorm that occurred in 2011. Overlaying CO2 flux maps on the GIS classified images shows that the area of diffuse emission generally correlates with the tree kill area.\nThis method was applied to imagery of thermal tree kill areas within Long Valley Caldera as well. Tree kill near Shady Rest Park in Mammoth Lakes expanded incrementally to the east, southeast and west between 1993 and 2014 to its present extent of about 0.053 km2, but this area also includes significant tree thinning by the city. In Basalt Canyon, southeast of Shady Rest, tree kill area has slowly expanded since 1995 to its present extent of about 0.041 km2.",

            "abstract": "The use of the very concept of effective refractive index has been implicit in virtually all computations of electromagnetic scattering by dust-like aerosols since the nanometer-scale heterogeneity of such particles has been essentially ignored. Therefore, the failure of this concept in application to dust-like aerosols would create a highly problematic situation. It is thus imperative to perform a comprehensive analysis of the actual physical origin of the heuristic effective-medium approximations (EMAs) and the range and conditions of their practical applicability.\nIn this talk, we will identify the true place of the EMAs in the framework of statistical electrodynamics. We will validate the outcome of this analysis by superposition T-matrix computer calculations and will perform a detailed quantitative assessment of the actual accuracy of the EMAs when they are applied to less-than-ideal types of heterogeneity encountered in nature. It is expected that the accuracy of an EMA will depend on many factors:\non type of mixing;\non refractive indices and size parameters of the host and the inclusions;\non number, spatial distribution, and packing density of the inclusions;\non whether one computes monodisperse or polydisperse optical characteristics;\non whether one computes only integral radiometric characteristics or also the elements of the scattering matrix; etc.\nIf so, the actual practical suitability of an EMA will vary widely depending on the specific type of application, e.g., lidar remote sensing, polarimetric remote sensing, radiometric remote sensing, or integral radiation-budget computations.",

            "abstract": "Introduction\nThe 2010 earthquake in Haiti displaced millions of people and drastically induced mass wasting. The purpose of this study is to explore comprehensive relationships between population displacement and landslide frequency by comparing land use and land cover (LULC) maps of pre- and post-earthquake. To assess the impact of anthropogenic activities, we employed a maximum likelihood method to produce LULC maps from Landsat images for the dry season of 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. Landslide inventory maps were created with ArcGIS and Google Earth to visually detect mass wasting coverage for each year. We assessed LULC characteristics of new landslide areas for pre- and post-earthquake to find out what types of land cover most likely caused landslide events and how they were affected by anthropogenic activities in Haiti. The result (Figure 1) shows that the majority of the landslides occurred in the areas of bare soil and grassland over the entire period of this study. These types of land cover are generally considered to be landslide prone due to lack of forest, which leads to a weakening of slope stability. In the earthquake year of 2010, landslide events were dominantly found in bare soil (67.5%) while grassland only occupied 5.1% of total land use. After the earthquake, landslides increased 14.6% in the forest areas, and then decreased to 7% of the total land use in 2014. Post-earthquake data shows an increase of urban area landslides (16%). After the earthquake from 2010 to 2012, landslides in the forest area noticeably increased. This may be due to refugee camps, which were constructed after the earthquake. Clearing trees for biomass energy might have resulted in poor slope stability because roots are necessary to maintain soils.",

            "abstract": "Weather systems, particularly mid-latitude wave cyclones, have been known to play an important role in the short-term variation of near-surface air pollution. Ground measurements and model simulations have demonstrated that stagnant air and minimal precipitation associated with high pressure systems are conducive to pollutant accumulation. With the passage of a cold front, built up pollution is transported downwind of the emission sources or washed out by precipitation. This concept is important to note when studying long-term changes in spatio-temporal pollution distribution, but has not been studied in detail from space. In this study, we focus on East Asia (especially the industrialized eastern China), where numerous large power plants and other point sources as well as area sources emit large amounts of SO2, an important gaseous pollutant and a precursor of aerosols. Using data from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) we show that such weather driven distribution can indeed be discerned from satellite data by utilizing probability distribution functions (PDFs) of SO2 column content. These PDFs are multimodal and give insight into the background pollution level at a given location and contribution from local and upwind emission sources. From these PDFs it is possible to determine the frequency for a given region to have SO2 loading that exceeds the background amount. By comparing OMI-observed long-term change in the frequency with meteorological data, we can gain insights into the effects of climate change (e.g., the weakening of Asian monsoon) on regional air quality. Such insight allows for better interpretation of satellite measurements as well as better prediction of future pollution distribution as a changing climate gives way to changing weather patterns.",

            "abstract": "Several proxy and modelling studies suggest that there may have been considerable change in the operation of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the last millennium. Yet despite its importance for regional and global climate, the recent history of the AMOC is poorly constrained, and comprehensive observational records only extend back a few decades at most. Observational data suggest that the export of large volumes of sea-ice and freshwater from the Arctic during the Great Salinity Anomaly of the late 1960s to early 1970s impacted North Atlantic circulation, and perhaps the strength of the AMOC, thus raising the possibility that more extreme events may have affected the AMOC during the pre-instrumental era.\nFirstly, we place the last millennium in a longer-term context by presenting Holocene grain-size records in depth transects from Blake Outer Ridge and Cape Hatteras, sampling the full-depth range of the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), part of the lower limb of the AMOC. These records complement a depth-transect of grain-size records sampling the Iceland-Scotland (I-S) overflow, and together enable us to provide a synthesis of Holocene changes in the deep components of the AMOC and the impact on the AMOC of long-term variability in the export of Arctic sea-ice and freshwater.\nWe then present detailed grain-size records for the last 1,000 years, both in a depth transect of cores off Cape Hatteras, and from cores in the Iceland Basin, sampling the I-S overflow. Initial results suggest a pronounced reduction over the last ~100-200 years in the inferred flow strength at sites bathed by Labrador Sea Water (LSW), while sites south of Iceland show an exceptional weakening of the I-S overflow over the last ~300 years. We explore the possibility that these events are linked to the export of large volumes of sea-ice and freshwater from the Arctic during the end of the Little Ice Age.",

We identified ashes supporting Costa Rican (~130), Nicaraguan (17) and Guatemalan (27) sources as well as ~150 tephra layers from the Galápagos hotspot. Within our marine record we also identified well-known marker beds such as the Los Chocoyos tephra from Atitlán Caldera in Guatemala and the Tiribi Tuff from Costa Rica but also correlations to 15 distinct deposits from known Costa Rican and Nicaraguan eruptions within the last 4.1 Ma. These correlations, together with new radiometric age dates, provide the base for an improved tephrochronostratigraphy in this region. Finally, the new marine record of explosive volcanism offshore southern CAVA provides insights into the eruptive history of long-living volcanic complexes (e.g., Barva, Costa Rica) and into the distribution and frequency of large explosive eruptions from the Galápagos hotspot.\nThe integrated approach of Ar/Ar age dating, correlations with on land deposits from CAVA, biostratigraphic ages and sediment accumulation rates improved the age models for the drilling sites.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography elucidates broad, low shear-wave velocity structures in the lower mantle beneath Africa and the central Pacific with uncertain physical and compositional origins. The anomalously slow areas, which cover nearly 50% of the core-mantle boundary, are often referred to as Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) due to the reduced velocity of seismic waves passing through them. Several hypotheses have arisen to explain the LLSVPs in the context of large-scale mantle convection. One end-member scenario infers a spatial correlation between LLSVP margins at depth and the reconstructed surface eruption sites of hotspots, kimberlites, and Large Igneous Provinces. Such a correlation has been explained by the preferential triggering of plumes at LLSVP margins by impingement of the subducting lithosphere upon the lower thermal boundary layer at the interface between ambient mantle and the higher density structures. This scenario propounds that Earth’s plate motion history plays a controlling role in plume development, and that the location, geometry and morphology of plumes may be influenced by the movement of subducting slabs. \nHere, we investigate what is necessary to create such a pattern of plume distribution in relation to LLSVPs. We consider what effect past plate motions may have had on the evolution of Earth’s lower mantle, and discuss the development of mantle plumes in terms of subduction dynamics. We integrate plate tectonic histories and numerical models of mantle convection to investigate the role that subduction history plays in the development and evolution of plumes in the presence of LLSVPs. To test whether an interaction exists between the surface location of subduction and plume eruption sites, and if so, to what degree over time, we apply varying shifts to the absolute reference frame of the plate reconstruction. With this method, we are able to change the location of subduction at the surface and thus the global flow field. This in turn affects the time-dependent sinking of lithospheric slabs and may affect their interaction with the lower mantle and the LLSVPs at both their margins and top surfaces. We aim to understand how the subduction history has affected mantle structure on a global scale and to decipher which features of the mantle influence where and when plumes are generated. ",

The Huangpu River, connecting the Taihu Lake and the Yangtze River, is one of the major drains, which is strongly influenced by high tide conditions in the coastal waters of the Yangtze River. Hence, constructing an estuary gate is considered one of the effective solutions to the flooding problem in the basin. This paper aims to quantitatively analyze the potential contributions of the proposed Huangpu gate to flood control capacity of the basin under various flooding scenarios. It is concluded that the Huangpu gate is an effective mean to evacuate the floodwaters, by reducing peak levels in the upper part of the tide-affected river. It’s beneficiaries include the Taihu Lake, the related surrounding areas along the Taipu Canal and the Huangpu River basin.\nKeywords: Flood control, Estuary gate, Taihu Lake Basin, Scenario analysis, Tide intrusion",

            "abstract": "The intent of this talk is to discuss the progress and issues involved with developing a continuous record of cloud properties since 1978, beginning with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS), then MODIS on the NASA Terra/Aqua platforms, and into the future from merged CrIS and VIIRS data. The MODIS measurements include infrared (IR) window radiances at 8.5-, 11- and 12-μm and four 15-μm channels in the broad CO2 absorption band. Cloud top pressure/height and emissivity are derived using a technique in which the strength is in retrievals for mid-to-high clouds but less so for low clouds where there is little thermal contrast with the surface. Additionally, MODIS provides a decadal IR cloud phase product. The goal now is to extend this continuity from HIRS and MODIS to the S-NPP era. However, there is one large drawback to consider: VIIRS has no infrared (IR) absorption channels. The lack of at least one IR absorption channel on VIIRS degrades the accuracy of the cloud properties. There is a solution: we can construct a 13.3-μm channel from a combination of VIIRS and CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder). The approach involves using the high spatial resolution VIIRS IR window channels in combination with a lower spatial resolution 13.3-μm channel derived using CrIS high spectral resolution measurements. The result is a 13.3-μm pseudo-channel at the VIIRS pixel spatial resolution of 750 m (i.e., M-band resolution). The radiometric accuracy of this approach was tested using MODIS and AIRS, and found to be within 1-2%. The availability of the pseudo-channel increases the potential for achieving continuity between MODIS and S-NPP. Since future platforms will likely continue with a pairing of an imager and hyperspectral sounder, this work lays a foundation for future cloud product continuity. We will show how the use of this new channel will impact the cloud height and phase products.",

            "abstract": "Current and future demand for food, feed, fiber, and energy require novel approaches to land management, which demands that multifunctional landscapes are created to integrate various ecosystem functions into a sustainable land use. Concurrently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts an increase of 2 to 4°C over the next 100 years above the preindustrial baseline, beginning as early as 2016 to 2035 over all seasons in the North America. This climate change is projected to further strain water resources currently stressed by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, placement of bioenergy crops on strategically selected sub-field areas in an agricultural landscape has the potential to increase the environmental and economic sustainability if location and choice of the crops result in minimal disruption of current food production systems and therefore cause minimal indirect land use change. This study identified sub-field marginal areas in an agricultural watershed using soil-based environmental sustainability criteria and a crop productivity index. Future landscape patterns (FLPs) were developed by allocating bioenergy crops (switchgrass: Panicum virgatum or shrub willows: Salix spp.) to these marginal areas (20% of the watershed). SWAT hydrologic model and dynamically downscaled climatic projection were used to asses impact of climate change on extreme flow conditions, total annual production of commodity and bioenergy crops, and water quality under current and future landscape patterns for the mid-21st century (2045-2055) and late 21st century (2085-2095) climatic projections. The frequency of flood and drought conditions was projected to increase while the corresponding durations to decrease. Sediment yields were projected to increase by 85% to 170% while FLPs would mitigate this increase by 26% to 32%.",

            "abstract": "We developed a seafloor array system of pressure gauges to record disturbances on both the oceanic and solid-Earth sides. The array consists of 10 high-resolution pressure gauges (PARO-8B7000-I-005) in a regular triangle configuration with site intervals of 10 km. The targeted disturbances on the oceanic side include infragravity waves, tsunamis and low-mode internal tides. Those on the solid-Earth side include P-wave families and Rayleigh waves, in particular, the Airy phase of suboceanic Rayleigh waves at periods around 10 s. We confirmed using data from the Nankai Trough seafloor network of pressure gauges (DONET) that our system should enable us to retrieve accurately the first-mode internal tides with the signal power four orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding semidiurnal surface tides. We installed this system around (32.4N, 140.3E, 1500-2200m depths) on the upper slope of the Izu-Bonin Trench in May 2014. The system was recovered in May-June 2015 and reinstalled around (31.2N, 141.7E, 4700-5700m depths) on the lower slope of this trench in a hope to recover in June 2016 (see Figure). The already recovered data contains records of the tsunami earthquake of May 02, 2015, at epicentral distances around 90 km. Its seismic magnitude was only 5.7, yet the tsunami height was 0.5 m at the 170km-distant island. Our pressure records show P-wave families followed by dispersive tsunami wave trains with amplitudes about 200 Pa successively passing through the array. Although P-wave families of comparable amplitudes were recorded by the M5.6 near-trench low-angle thrust earthquake of May 10, 2015, at epicentral distances around 160 km, they were not followed by any visible tsunami signals. These observations imply merits of sea-bottom pressure array, including easiness of comparing amplitudes of seismic waves and tsunamis on the same record and capability of tracing two-dimensional tsunami propagation through the array as a function of period.",

            "abstract": "Programs to plant millions of trees in cities around the world aim at the reduction of summer temperatures, increase carbon storage, storm water control, provision of space for recreation, as well as poverty alleviation. Although these multiple benefits speak positively for urban greening programs, the programs do not take into account how close human and natural systems are coupled in urban areas. Elevated temperatures together with anthropogenic emissions of air and water pollutants distinguish the urban system. Urban and sub-urban vegetation responds to ambient changes and reacts with pollutants. Neglecting this coupling may lead to unforeseen drawbacks of urban greening programs. The potential for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from vegetation combined with anthropogenic emissions to produce ozone has long been recognized. This potential increases under rising temperatures. Here we investigate how heat waves affect emissions of VOC from urban vegetation and corresponding ground-level ozone. In this study we use Weather Research and Forecasting Model with coupled atmospheric chemistry (WRF-CHEM) to quantify these feedbacks in Berlin, Germany during the 2006 heat wave. VOC emissions from vegetation are simulated with MEGAN 2.0 coupled with WRF-CHEM. Our preliminary results indicate that contribution of VOCs from vegetation to ozone formation may increase by more than twofold during the heat wave period. We highlight the importance of the vegetation for urban areas under changing climate and discuss associated tradeoffs.",

            "abstract": "Soils develop as the result of a complex suite of biogeochemical and physical processes; however, effective modeling of soil development over pedogenic time scales and the resultant soil property variability is limited to individual chronosequence studies or overly broad generalizations. Soil chronosequence studies are used to understand soil development across a landscape with time, but traditional soil chronosequence studies do not account for uncertainty in soil development, and the results of these studies are site dependent. Here we develop a probabilistic approach to quantify the distribution of probable soil property values based on a review of soil chronosequence studies. Specifically, we examined the changes in the distributions of soil texture and solum thickness with increasing time and influx of pedogenic energy from climatic and biological forcings. We found the greatest variability in maximum measured clay content occurred between 103 to 105 years, with convergence of clay contents in soils older than 106 years. Conversely, we found that the variability in maximum sand content increased with increasing time, with the greatest variability in soils between 105 to 106 years old; we did not find distributional changes in maximum silt content with time. Bivariate normal probability distributions were parameterized using the chronosequence data, from which conditional univariate distributions based on the total pedogenic energy (age x rate of energy flux) were calculated, allowing determination of a probable range of soil properties for a given age and bioclimatic environment. The bivariate distribution was capable of effectively representing the measured maximum clay content values with an r2 of 0.53 (p < 0.0001, RMSE = 14.36%). By taking a distributional approach to quantifying soil development and variability, we can quantitatively probabilistically represent the full state factor model, while explicitly quantifying the uncertainty in soil development.",

            "abstract": "Sulfide-rich Ni-Cu-PGE orebodies hosted in mafic to ultramafic igneous rocks require focused magma flow and vigorous interaction with country rocks to liberate sulfide, as well as to produce traps for immiscible sulfide liquid. In the 1.1 Ga Midcontinent Rift System (MRS), Ni-rich sulfide deposits occur in conduit systems. Variations in S and Os isotope ratios indicate that magmas which followed different crustal pathways were focused into a central conduit that supplied overlying flows and sills. The 1.3 Ga Voisey’s Bay deposit in Labrador represents sulfide liquid collection in a conduit system which includes dike-like bodies and larger sub-horizontal chambers. Variable d34S values again strongly suggest that focused magma flow and turbulence in the conduit resulted in the input of magmatic pulses that had undergone S isotopic homogenization even though pelitic country rocks are characterized by a range in S isotope values from -17 to +18 ‰. A very similar physical setting characterizes the sulfide-bearing Duke Island Complex, a Cretaceous – aged Ural-Alaskan intrusion in an arc setting. Magma pulses of variable sulfur isotopic compositions were focused into a central chamber where sulfide-bearing magma spread laterally. Trapped silicate liquid was efficiently expelled, leaving sulfide-bearing ultramafic cumulates. A less turbulent environment is indicated for sheet-like intrusions that carry disseminated sulfide mineralization in the Duluth Complex within the MRS. However, the potential ore sequences were built from multiple pulses of magma of distinct S isotope values that had interacted with sulfidic country rocks characterized by different S isotope compositions. Hence, the focusing of magmas from different pathways has been essential for the generation of potential sulfide-rich ore bodies in the Duluth Complex as well.",

This problem is important in light of the fact that the subsurface provides more than 80 percent of the energy used in the United States and serves as a reservoir for geological carbon sequestration, used fuel disposition, and nuclear waste storage. Adaptive control of subsurface fractures and fluid flow is a crosscutting challenge being addressed by the new Department of Energy SubTER Initiative that has the potential to transform subsurface energy production and waste storage strategies.\nOur methodology to address the above mentioned matter is based on a novel Advance Multi-Physics Tomographic (AMT) approach for determining the state of stress, thereby facilitating our ability to monitor and control subsurface geomechanical processes. We developed the AMT algorithm for deriving state-of-stress from integrated density and seismic velocity models and demonstrate the feasibility by applying the AMT approach to synthetic data sets to assess accuracy and resolution of the method as a function of the quality and type of geophysical data. With this method we can produce regional- to basin-scale maps of the background state of stress and identify regions where stresses are changing. Our approach is based on our major advances in the joint inversion of gravity and seismic data to obtain the elastic properties for the subsurface; and coupling afterwards the output from this joint-inversion with theoretical model such that strain (and subsequently) stress can be computed. Ultimately we will obtain the differential state of stress over time to identify and monitor critically stressed faults and evolving regions within the reservoir, and relate them to anthropogenic activities such as fluid/gas injection.",

By comparing the modeling results with the OMNI and Ulysses data over seven Carrington rotations in 2007, we have conducted a third-party validation of these models for the near-Earth solar wind and the solar wind at mid-to-high latitudes, respectively. We have developed comprehensive performance metrics for solar wind simulation, which can be adapted to future model validation. The performance metrics include visual comparison, assessment of the time series and statistics of solar wind parameters, evaluation focused on the magnetic field sector boundaries (SBs) and slow-to-fast stream interaction regions (SIRs). General strengths and weaknesses for each model are diagnosed to provide an unbiased reference to model developers and users. For this period, the 2014 version of MAS-Enlil model works best for SBs; the heliospheric tomography works best for SIRs; while the 2012 version of SWMF model works best for fast wind at mid-to-high latitudes.

The annual cycle of the salinity budgets of the open-ocean STSM (those not including the North Indian) differ in magnitude but are qualitatively similar. While the surface layer salinity budgets typically focus on the advection of salinity within the surface layer, we examine role of both mode water formation and the seasonal cycle of the density ratio near the base of the mixed layer to demonstrate the influence of Type II (Eastern Subtropical) mode water formation and salt finger convection at the base of the mixed layer on the budget. The model predicts that significant amounts of salt fingers exist seasonally within the mixed layer in regions exhibiting low density ratio and enhance the vertical diffusive salt flux through the base of the mixed layer. We also compute transformation within the isohaline volumes surrounding each STSM. It demonstrates that the dominant mixing process is vertical diffusion for all of the STSM, with the notable exception of the South Indian, where vertical diffusion transforms 6 Sv and eddy induced mixing transforms 14 Sv.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge regarding the effects of cross-scale structural and process connectivity on runoff and erosion events on disturbed rangelands remains limited due to the individual plot-scale nature of most research. This study quantified surface susceptibility and runoff and erosion across point- to hillslope-scales at unburned and burned woodland-encroached shrublands using high-intensity rainfall simulation, overland flow experiments, and hydrologic modeling. High levels of runoff (31-47 mm) and erosion (154-1893 g m-2) were measured at the patch scale (13 m2) associated with accumulation of fine-scale (0.5 m2) runoff and sediment and high velocity (0.10-0.26 m s-1) concentrated flow through contiguous bare zones (64-85% bare ground). Burning increased continuity of runoff sources and sediment availability. For unburned and burned conditions, cumulative runoff was generally consistent across plot-scales while erosion increased with increasing plot-area up to the patch scale. The cross-scale increase in erosion is attributed to enhanced sediment detachment and transport in concentrated flow paths. At the hillslope scale, predicted runoff and erosion rates reflected the measured patch-scale runoff and erosion trends and the connectivity of hydrologic and erosion processes and sediment availability. For similar rainfall across unburned conditions, predicted hillslope runoff (19-35 mm) was slightly less than or equal to measured patch-scale runoff (27-37 mm), and predicted erosion (100-413 g m-2) was greater than or similar to patch-scale measured erosion (124-311 g m-2). For burned conditions, predicted hillslope runoff (36-41 mm) was greater than or equal to patch-scale runoff (28-34 mm), and predicted hillslope erosion (314-516 g m-2) was either consistent with or decreased relative to patch-scale measures (274-884 g m-2). The decline in simulated hillslope-scale erosion relative to measured patch-scale erosion for burned conditions is attributed to limited sediment availability at the hillslope scale. The cross-scale experiments and simulations clearly demonstrate that the magnitude of hillslope response on disturbed rangelands is governed by the connectivity in surface susceptibility, runoff and erosion processes, and sediment availability and the rate or volume of rainfall input.",

            "abstract": "Electrical conductivity as measured by the Magnetotelluric (MT) method provides a powerful means of mapping fluid release from subducting slabs and the subsequent melt transport to the volcanic arc.\nIt is well known that both aqueous fluids and partial melt are electrically conductive, with conductivities that depend on temperature and composition, although many of the details of the relationships between the controlling influences are not well constrained by the existing database of laboratory measurements.\nRecent MT images from subduction zones generally highlight two primary areas of fluid release. The first typically occurs at depths around 40km, and is thought to represent the release of fluid as basalt transitions to eclogite. The second, deeper release, appears to relate to the breakdown of serpentinite in the upper mantle of the downgoing slab. In general, the shallower release results in a conductor caused by aqueous fluids while the deeper release is into mantle sufficiently hot that melting occurs. The processes involved in this deeper release and melting make it difficult to untangle the contributions of water and melt to the bulk conductivity and, along with limitations in lab data, make it difficult to constrain melt and fluid fractions.\nWe look at example sections from a range of subduction zones and highlight some of the controls on where conductors occur, and why in some cases they aren’t seen. Particularly important is the nature of the incoming plate and the kinematics and duration of subduction. We will show through these examples the current limits of our abilities to untangle the signatures of melt from water in the transport processes.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture and its spatio-temporal pattern is one of the main drivers in complex soil-vegetation-atmosphere exchange processes. In order to observe long-term patterns of surface soil moisture, we analyzed a historical data set of ERS SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data using 85 ERS scenes from 1995-2003 for the Rur catchment (2364 km2) in Western Germany. The ERS satellites operated in C-band and single-channel VV polarization. To derive surface soil moisture from the microwave backscatter intensity, the influence of surface roughness and vegetation biomass on the backscatter must be taken into account. Thus, a simple soil moisture index was developed to retrieve semi-quantitative information about spatial soil moisture patterns with a simple yet robust approach. By using data from all available scenes for each month of the year, histograms of σ0-values for each agricultural land use class (cereals, sugar beet, pasture) were generated. Within each of these histograms, the influence of biomass and surface roughness on backscatter is assumed to be constant. Thus, changes in backscatter intensity are due to changes in surface soil moisture. Since the histograms are based on data from 8 years, we assume that each histogram contains pixels representing the wet and the dry soil moisture state. An index was spanned between high and low backscatter values, identifying wet and dry areas. By using soil texture information of the given location, the qualitative index can be translated into volumetric soil moisture. The resulting soil moisture maps were compared to precipitation data from nearby meteorological stations.",

Most of the activity was dedicated to the definition of standards to handle data in this field. The aim was to facilitate searches in big archives as well as sparse databases, to make on-line data access and visualization possible, and to allow small data providers to make their data available in an interoperable environment with minimum effort. This system makes intensive use of studies and developments led in Astronomy (IVOA), Solar Science (HELIO), and space archive services (IPDA).\nA general standard has been devised to handle the specific complexity of Planetary Science, e.g. in terms of measurement types and coordinate frames [1]. A procedure has been identified to install small data services, and several hands-on sessions have been organized already. A specific client (VESPA) has been developed at VO-Paris (http://vespa.obspm.fr), using a resolver for target names. Selected data can be sent to VO visualization tools such as TOPCAT or Aladin though the SAMP protocol.\nThe Europlanet H2020 program started in Sept 2015 will provide support to new data services in Europe (30 to 50 expected), and focus on the improvement of the infrastructure. Future steps will include the development of a connection between the VO world and GIS tools, and integration of heliophysics, planetary plasma and reference spectroscopic data.\nThe Europlanet H2020 project is funded by the European Commission under the H2020 Program, grant 654208.\n[1] Erard et al Astron & Comp 2014",

            "abstract": "The origin of volatiles on Earth is still matter of debates. Noble gases turn out to be an efficient tool due to their inertness in chemical reactions and can then allow us to constrain Earth’s atmosphere formation processes. In that way several studies have focused on lower mantle neon isotopes because the 20Ne/22Ne ratio is thought to reflect that of Earth’s primordial components. Two models for light noble gases origin on Earth have hence been proposed: either solar wind implantation of the Earth's precursors or dissolution into the mantle of a primordial atmosphere captured from the solar nebula gas. In order to support one of the two models, we analyzed the noble gas compositions (helium, neon and argon) of oceanic island basalts from Fernandina (Galápagos hotspot). The samples are studied both by step-crushing and by laser ablation analyses of single vesicles. Results of step-crushing are consistent with those of laser ablation analyses. But the latter results permit to get rid of atmospheric contamination and to identify which crushing steps are subject to such contamination. Helium isotopic ratios R/Ra (where R is the 3He/4He ratio and Ra the atmospheric ratio) are about 23 for the two Galápagos samples. We obtain 20Ne/22Ne and 40Ar/36Ar isotopic ratios as high as 12.85-12.87 and 7000-9400 respectively for the source of the Galápagos hotspot. Hence, we show that step-crushing and laser ablation analyses are two complementary methods that should be used together to derive the noble gas ratios in uncontaminated samples. The results of neon compositions are consistent with other studies on other hotspots and support the model of solar wind implantation associated with sputtering to explain helium and neon origins on Earth.",

            "abstract": "Relative permeabilities to water and gas are important parameters for accurate modeling of the formation of methane hydrate deposits and production of methane from hydrate reservoirs. Experimental measurements of gas and water permeability in the presence of hydrate are difficult to obtain. The few datasets that do exist suggest that relative permeability obeys a power law relationship with water or gas saturation with exponents ranging from around 2 to greater than 10. Critical path analysis and percolation theory provide a framework for interpreting the saturation-dependence of relative permeability based on percolation thresholds and the breadth of pore size distributions, which may be determined easily from 3-D images or gas adsorption-desorption hysteresis. We show that the exponent of the permeability-saturation relationship for relative permeability to water is related to the breadth of the pore size distribution, with broader pore size distributions corresponding to larger exponents. Relative permeability to water in well-sorted sediments with narrow pore size distributions, such as Berea sandstone or Toyoura sand, follows percolation scaling with an exponent of 2. On the other hand, pore-size distributions determined from argon adsorption measurements we performed on clays from the Nankai Trough suggest that relative permeability to water in fine-grained intervals may be characterized by exponents as large as 10 as determined from critical path analysis. We also show that relative permeability to the gas phase follows percolation scaling with a quadratic dependence on gas saturation, but the threshold gas saturation for percolation changes with hydrate saturation, which is an important consideration in systems in which both hydrate and gas are present, such as during production from a hydrate reservoir. Our work shows how measurements of pore size distributions from 3-D imaging or gas adsorption may be used to determine relative permeabilities.",

Recent controls to reduce the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOX and NOX) have increased the importance of understanding the role ammonia plays in the formation of surface fine inorganic particulate matter (PM2.5) in the United States. In this study, we identify the interannual variability in ammonia concentration, explore the sources of this variability and determine their contribution to the variability in surface PM2.5 concentration. Over the summers of 2008-2012, measurements from the Ammonia Monitoring Network (AMoN) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite instrument show considerable variability in both surface and column ammonia concentrations (+/- 29% and 28% of the mean), respectively. This observed variability is larger than that simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, where meteorology dominates the variability in ammonia and PM2.5 concentrations compared to the changes caused by SOX and NOX reductions. Our initial simulation does not include year-to-year changes in ammonia agricultural emissions. We use county-wide information on fertilizer sales and livestock populations, as well as meteorological variations to account for the interannual variability in agricultural activity and ammonia volatilization. These sources of ammonia emission variability are important for replicating observed variations in ammonia and PM2.5, highlighting how accurate ammonia emissions characterization is central to PM air quality prediction.",

            "abstract": "Human activities can stimulate the physical and chemical properties of streams to move beyond their background conditions, thereby facilitating the transition of these factors to stressors that affect watershed resilience. This is particularly true in mixed land cover watersheds. We quantify and explore the statistical nonlinear relationships between watershed and buffer-scale factors and nutrient (nitrite-nitrate (NO2-NO3), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP)) concentrations, in addition to a multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), in a mesoscale mixed land cover watershed. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the potentially numerous landscape and near-stream hydrological and biogeochemical factors that affect watershed resiliency – as inferred from in-stream nutrient levels and biological condition. We used a boosted regression tree approach, which quantifies nonlinear relationships and variable interactions, to develop watershed and 200 m buffer scale models for each chemical constituent and the annual IBI score. We developed nutrient models for the spring and summer seasons. Two primary factors – location within the watershed and percentage of urban land cover in the watershed or buffer – emerged as important explanatory variables in most nutrient and IBI models. Geographic location (i.e., latitude and longitude) interacted with other factors to explain the variability in summer NO2-NO3 concentrations and IBI scores and suggested that location might be associated with indicators of sources (e.g., land cover) and runoff potential (e.g., soil and topographic factors). Runoff indicators (e.g., Hydrologic Soil Group D and Topographic Wetness Indices) explained a substantial portion of the variability in nutrient concentrations as did point sources for TP in the summer months. Our overall approach confirms that it is important to consider multiple and often interacting factors when managing for watershed resilience.",

The emissions from the burning do not only affect air quality and climate locally, but also on a continental to hemispheric scales through long-range transport. We have used NASA’s Global Modeling Initiative Chemistry and Transport Model (GMI-CTM), to quantify the changes in surface ozone over Northern Sub-Saharan Africa (NSSA: 0 – 20N, 20W – 55E), as triggered by biomass burning from different regions.\nDuring the winter months (e.g. January), most of the burning is concentrated in the NSSA region while in summer it shifts southward outside the NSSA region. Our analysis reveals that out of the total contribution to surface ozone from biomass burning emissions in the NSSA region, 92 % is due to NSSA biomass burning while the remaining 8 % is from outside the NSSA. In fact, most (~75 %) of the 8 % comes from outside the African continent because little to no biomass burning occurs in Africa outside of the NSSA region during this time of year. However, during the summer months (e.g. July), most of the contribution to NSSA surface ozone (96 %) is due to burning from outside NSSA. Only 10 % of the 96 % comes from outside the African continent because during this time most of the burning is from outside the NSSA but within the African continent. In spring (e.g. April) approximately equal percentages of contributions come from within and outside the NSSA region.",

            "abstract": "As a pivotal role of various applications for ocean sciences, the mean sea surface (MSS) has been developed by merging the sea surface heights (SSH) data sets from different missions for decades. Prior to combining various satellite data, a data adjustment process is applied to make those data sets more homogeneous and consistent. This process is required because there are significant differences in the characteristics and qualities of the measurement corrections, orbit accuracy and systematic biases between the multiple satellite data sets. We have developed a more effective and efficient data adjustment procedure that reduces the long-wavelength errors and systematic biases. A new method is used to obtain an improved SSH data set for selected satellite missions by integrating the SSH gradients with constraints imposed by the Jason-1 mean SSH profile. Using this approach, a total of 5 different satellite SSH data sets (2-year Geosat Exact repeat mission, 6-year ERS-2, 10-year Topex/Poseidon, 8-year Envisat and ERS-1 geodetic mission) were adjusted to the 7-year Jason-1 mean SSH profile. As a result, a new mean sea surface (MSS), named CSRMSS14, was determined from these adjusted satellite data sets. The accuracy of the new MSS was evaluated by comparing with the recent DTU10 global mean sea surface model, and a somewhat independent analysis was performed by comparing Jason-2 altimeter SSH data with DTU10 and CSRMSS14. This presentation describes the approach and the results of the model intercomparisons.",

Here we demonstrate how a system system combining eddy covariance and gradient techniques can be used to perform this assessment in a managed forest ecosystem.\n<span\">The net effects of clear-cutting and stump harvesting on GHG fluxes were studied at the ICOS site Norunda, Sweden. Micrometeorological measurements (i.e., flux-gradient measurements in 3 m tall towers) allowed for quantification of CO2, CH4 and H2O fluxes (from May 2010) as well as N2O and H2O fluxes (from June 2011) at two stump harvested plots and two control plots. There was one wetter and one drier plot of each treatment. Air was continuously sampled at two heights in the towers and gas concentrations were analyzed for CH4, CO2, H2O (LGR DLT-100, Los Gatos Research) and N2O, H2O (QCL Mini Monitor, Aerodyne Research). Friction velocities and sensible heat fluxes were measured by sonic anemometers (Gill Windmaster, Gill Instruments Ltd). Automatic chamber measurements (CO2, CH4, H2O) were carried out in the adjacent forest stand and at the clear-cut during 2010.\n<span\">Average CO2 emissions for the first year ranged between 14.4–20.2 ton CO2 ha-1 yr-1. The clear-cut became waterlogged after harvest and a comparison of flux-gradient data and chamber data (from the adjacent forest stand) indicated a switch from a weak CH4 sink to a significant source at all plots. The CH4 emissions ranged between 0.8–4.5 ton CO2-eq. ha-1 yr-1. N2O emissions ranged between 0.4–2.6 ton CO2-eq. ha-1 yr-1. Enhanced N2O emission on the drier stump harvested plot was the only clear treatment effect on GHG fluxes that was observed. Mean CH4 and N2O emissions for the first year of measurements amounted up to 29% and 20% of the mean annual CO2 emissions, respectively. This highlights the importance of including all GHGs when assessing the climate impacts of different forest management options. Our results show that continuous multi-plot measurements of the main GHGs are possible also at sites where GHG fluxes are low, at a reasonable cost and with reduced plot inter-comparison uncertainties.\n<span\">",

            "abstract": "Bathymetric map of SCS plate shows two subducting buoyancies, the fossil ridge and the oceanic plateau, which are supposed to impact slab segmentation into the north from Taiwan to 18°N, and the south from 17°N to Mindoro.\nHypocenter distribution show that slab dip angle turns lower southwards from 45° to 30° in the north segment, and relatively equals ~45° in the south segment at the depth of 100km. Moreover, volcano distribution can be segmented into Miocene WVC, Quaternary EVC in the north and combined SVC in the south (Fig. A). We found that WVC and SVC mostly locate in a parallel belt ~50km apart to Manila trench, however EVC turn father southwards from 50km to 100km (Fig. B). Above characters congruously indicate that SCS plate kept equal dip angle in Miocene; then the north segment shallowed at 18°N and developed northwards in Quaternary, resulting in lower dip angle than the invariant south segment.\nTo check the transformation of slab dip angle from 45° to 30° between 17~18°N, focal mechanism solution nearby 17°N are found 90° in rake and dip angle, strike parallel to the fossil ridge, indicating a slab tear located coincident with the ridge, where is a weak zone of higher heat flow and lower plate coupling ratio than the adjacent zones and slab can be easily tore as an interface for SCS plate segmentation.\nSubduction of the two buoyancies within SCS plate is supposed as influential dynamic factor: It caused the trench retreat rate reduced, forming a cusp and a flat convex of Manila trench shape; Moreover, the buoyancies resisted subduction, resulting in shear stress heterogeneity of SCS plate, in consequence the fossil ridge as a fragile belt potentially became stress concentration zone that easily tore; Then the buoyant oceanic plateau might lead to shallowing of the northern SCS plate. To examine the hypothesis, dynamic effects of the two subducting buoyancies are being respectively investigated based on numerical models. (Grt. 41376063, 2013CB956104)",

            "abstract": "The Logone floodplain (LFP), part of the Lake Chad Basin, is flooded annually by water from the Logone River and its branches during September and October. The inundated LFP is highly productive, providing support for fishing, pastoralism, and agriculture. In the last few decades, droughts, dam construction, manmade fishing canals (MFCs), and irrigation development have caused significant shifts in the LFP’s flooding regime. Recently, MFCs have proliferated as consequence of ecological and manmade changes in the LFP. Future impacts of these modifications may parallel projected, although still uncertain, regional hydroclimatic changes derived from global warming. In order to understand feedbacks between human actions and hydroclimate, we are developing an integrated model that links hydroclimate, hydraulics, and human dynamics such as fishermen and pastoralist behavior. Here we present one component of this research focused on simulating the annual flooding dynamics of the LFP using LISFLOOD-FP, a raster-based numerical model that includes sub-grid parameterization of MFCs. Our goal is to evaluate the model’s skill to simulate spatiotemporal features of the inundated LFP using a minimum amount of input data, such as discontinuous time series of river discharge and satellite-derived rainfall. Our simulations using three different spatial resolutions (1, 0.5, and 0.25-km grid-cell) suggest that the model is insensitive to pixel size, showing no significant differences between simulated volume, discharge, flooded area, and flood seasonality. Despite the model is able to simulate flow, with a Nash Sutcliff efficiency of 0.81, we find some significant spatial mismatch between observed and simulated inundation areas. In addition, results indicate that overbank flow provides more annual flood volume than rainfall. We discuss the impact of topographic and climatic input data on these results, as well as the potential to simulate the effects of MFCs on the local hydrology.",

            "abstract": "The introduction of commercial satellites with all-electric propulsion systems is nothing less than a revolution in the quest for low-cost access to space. As a consequence, it can take as long as 200 – 400 days to raise the perigee of the satellite to final geostationary orbit. During this time the satellites are exposed to the most intense part of the van Allen radiation belts where the electron radiation environment can vary by orders of magnitude as a result of changes in the solar wind. Here we describe briefly this new method of launch and discuss the importance of radiation protection, the need for real-time data on orbit and how physics based models can help supply this need. We describe the forecasting system that was developed in the European SPACECAST project, and is now continued in the SPACESTORM project, and how we use physics based models to forecast the electron flux throughout the outer radiation belt in real-time, updated hourly. We show that forecasts are much improved when the physics of wave-particle interactions is included, and show comparisons between models using different wave models for plasmaspheric hiss and chorus waves. The results emphasise the importance of chorus wave amplitudes. Finally, we discuss some areas of research needed to improve the forecasts, such as the need to understand electron flux drop-outs and their relation to distortions of the geomagnetic field in the tail region, and the need for additional wave models.",

            "abstract": "Climate models unanimously project a decline in the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice as the climate warms, but at differing rates. Projecting the timing of an ice-free Arctic is a topic that has received considerable scientific and public attention. An ice-free Arctic opens up the potential for shorter global trade routes through the Arctic Ocean and there has already been a sharp increase in the number of transits along Russia’s Northern Sea Route with escorts from nuclear powered icebreakers.\nHere we present results on the future of trans-Arctic shipping using bias corrected sea ice thickness projections, utilising the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble and considering multiple emission scenarios. We find that for ‘Open Water’ vessels (normal ocean going vessels that possess no specific ice strengthening), unaided trans-Arctic shipping is likely to become feasible in the next couple of decades. We find that the North West Passage will open approximately a decade later than the Northern Sea Route. Initially however, both routes exhibit marked inter-annual variability in accessibility which we quantify. The hypothesised trans-polar sea route through international waters via the North Pole will start to become navigable by 2050. Towards the latter period of the 21st century, normal ocean going vessels will be able to transit their choice of any of these routes for at least six months of any given year under the RCP 8.5 high future emissions scenario and four months for the lower RCP 4.5 emissions scenario. These findings suggest that further increases in global temperature could transform the Arctic into a global transport hub.",

We plan to install a total of 80 offline seismic observation stations in these areas for studying the effect of megathrust earthquake on the activities of inland earthquakes. In our project, maintenance will be held twice-a-year for 4 years from 2015 by using 2.0Hz short-period 3-component seismometer, KVS-300 and ultra-low-power data logger, EDR-X7000 (DC12V 0.08W power supply). We installed seismometer on the rock surface or the slope of the natural ground at the possible sites confirmed with low noise level to obtain distinct seismic waveform data. We report an improvement in installation method of the offline seismic observation station in the heavy snowfall area of Tohoku region based on the retrieved data. In the conventional method, seismometer was installed in the hand-dug hole of a slope in case it is not waterproof. Data logger and battery were installed in the box container on the ground surface, and then, GPS antenna was installed on the pole fixed by stepladder. There are risks of the inclination of seismometer and the damage of equipment in heavy snowfall area. In the new method, seismometer is installed in the robust concrete box on the buried basement consists of precast concrete mass to keep its horizontality. Data logger, battery, and GPS antenna are installed on a high place by using a single pole with anchor bolt and a pole mount cabinet to enhance their safety. As a result, total costs of installation are kept down because most of the equipment is reusable. Furthermore, an environmental burden of waste products is reduced.",

            "abstract": "Automatic earthquake processing and early warning systems typically use broadband velocity data. In spite of its limitations, the use of velocity data has been widely adopted in seismology because displacement time series are just one integration away, however, the integration process is not exempt from mathematical complexities.\nBecause broadband instruments have limited dynamic range and operate in an inertial reference frame, it's not possible to recover the full static displacements or very long periods for large earthquakes due to unmodeled rotational motions. Additionally, broadband records saturate in the presence of large local events.\nHere we present an implementation of real-time Kalman filtering at the Chilean National Seismological Center (CSN), which optimally combines GPS and strong motion data to produce robust corrected velocity and displacement traces. The Kalman filter method takes advantage of the individual strengths of each data type while minimizing their weaknesses. The calculated traces recover static offsets and very long periods while retaining the same sampling rate as acceleration data.\nThese very-broadband velocities and displacements can be used for a number of real-time and rapid seismological applications such as better understanding the earthquake rupture process and for improving early warning systems.",

            "abstract": "Release of COH fluids from hydrous minerals and carbonates influences element recycling and magmatism at subduction zones. Contradictory interpretations exist regarding the retention/storage of C in subducting plates and in the forearc to subarc mantle. Multiple lines of evidence indicate mobility of C in forearcs; however, the magnitude of this loss is highly uncertain[1-5]. A poorly constrained fraction of the 40-115 Mt/y of C initially subducted is released into fluids (e.g., by decarbonation, carbonate dissolution), and 18-43 Mt/y is returned at arc volcanoes[2-5, refs. therein]. The imbalance could reflect subduction into the deeper mantle or forearc/subarc storage[4-7].\nWe examine the fate of C in slab/interface ultramafic rocks, and by analogy serpentinized mantle wedge, via study of fluid-rock evolution of marble and variably carbonated serpentinite (Ligurian Alps). Based on petrography, and major/trace element and C and O isotope compositions, we demonstrate that serpentinite dehydration at 2-2.5 GPa, 550°C released aqueous fluids triggering breakdown of dolomite in nearby marbles, thus releasing C into fluids. Carbonate + olivine veins document flow of COH fluids; interaction of these COH fluids with serpentinite led to formation of high-pressure carbonated ultramafic-rock domains, thus resulting in retention of C in some rocks at an ancient subduction interface. We stress that lithologically complex interfaces could contain sites of both C release and C addition, further confounding estimates of net C loss at forearc and subarc depths [cf 4,5]. Sites of C retention, also including carbonate veins and graphite as reduced carbonate[7], could influence the transfer of slab C to at least the depths beneath volcanic fronts.\n1.

            "abstract": "Upland soils are an important sink for atmospheric methane (CH4). Uptake of atmospheric CH4 in soils is generally diffusion limited, and is mediated by aerobic CH4 oxidizing bacteria (MOB) that possess a high-affinity form of a key enzyme, allowing CH4 consumption at near-atmospheric concentrations (≤ 1.9 µL/L). As cultivation attempts for these high-affinity MOB have shown little success, there remains much speculation regarding their functioning in different environments. For example, it is frequently assumed that they are highly sensitive to physical disturbance, but their response in activity and abundance to changes in substrate availability remains largely unknown.\nWe present results of a laboratory column experiment conducted to investigate the response in activity and abundance of high-affinity MOB to an increase in CH4 flux. Intact soil cores, collected at a field site where atmospheric CH4 oxidation activity is frequently quantified, were transferred into two 1-m-long, 12-cm-dia. columns. The columns were operated at constant temperature in the dark, their headspace being continuously flushed with air. Diffusive gas-transport conditions were maintained in the reference column, whereas CH4 flux was increased in several steps in the treatment column by inducing advective gas flow using a diaphragm pump. Soil-gas samples periodically collected from ports installed along the length of the columns were analyzed for CH4 content. Together with measurements of soil-water content, atmospheric CH4 oxidation was quantified using the soil-profile method. First results indicate that atmospheric CH4 oxidation activity comparable with the field was maintained in the reference column throughout the experiment. Moreover, high-affinity MOB quickly adjusted to an increase in CH4 flux in the treatment column, efficiently consuming CH4. Quantification of MOB abundance is currently ongoing. Our data provide new insights into controls on atmospheric CH4 oxidation in soils.",

            "abstract": "The Paleozoic Hudson Bay intracratonic basin conceals a Paleoproterozoic Himalayan-scale continental collision, the Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO), which marks an important milestone in the assembly of the Canadian Shield. The geometry of the THO is complex due to the double-indentor geometry of the collision between the Archean Superior and Western Churchill cratons.\nSeismic observations at regional scale show a thick, seismically fast lithospheric keel beneath the entire region; an intriguing feature of recent models is a ‘curtain’ of slightly lower wavespeeds trending NE-SW beneath the Bay, which may represent the remnants of more juvenile material trapped between the two Archean continental cores. The seismic models alone, however, cannot constrain the nature of this anomaly.\nWe investigate the thermal and compositional structure of the Hudson Bay lithosphere using a multi-observable probabilistic inversion technique. This joint inversion uses Rayleigh wave phase velocity data from teleseismic earthquakes and ambient noise, geoid anomalies, surface elevation and heat flow to construct a pseudo-3D model of the crust and upper mantle. Initially a wide range of possible mantle compositions is permitted, and tests are carried out to ascertain whether the lithosphere is stratified with depth.\nAcross the entire Hudson Bay region, low temperatures and a high degree of chemical depletion characterise the mantle lithosphere. Temperature anomalies within the lithosphere are modest, as may be expected from a tectonically-stable region. The base of the thermal lithosphere lies at depths of >250 km, reaching to ~300 km depth in the centre of the Bay. Lithospheric stratification, with a more-depleted upper layer, is best able to explain the geophysical data sets and surface observables. Some regions, where intermediate-period phase velocities are high, require stronger mid-lithospheric depletion. In addition, a narrow region of less-depleted material extends NE-SW across the Bay, likely associated with the trace of the THO collision and the entrapment of juvenile material between the highly-depleted Archean cores.",

            "abstract": "Water is an integral part of nature; it is crucial in supporting life. Bodies of water in our planet include rivers, which provide various ecosystem services. Monitoring water quality is essential for assessment of current conditions of water bodies as well as of the progress of rehabilitation efforts. Calumpang River in Batangas City, Philippines, holds huge potential for ecosystem services; this potential is hindered by its degraded water quality at present. This study aims to develop an initial method for water quality assessment through interpolation of imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and surface water quality data (Chl-A and CDOM) measured from in situ water sampling on defined reference points on the Calumpang River, with considerations for temporal variations (i.e. dry vs. wet season). Surface water quality data for dry and wet seasons and UAV imagery collected and analyzed from the dry season serve as preliminary results. Data indicate that there were higher Chl-A concentrations during the dry season, as expected. In contrast, CDOM concentrations were higher during the wet season. This is attributed to increased amount of detritus in the river accumulated through runoff and loading. The method of interpolating UAV imagery and water quality data can serve and be further improved as a means for rapid assessment of the water quality in water bodies in the future, and aid in the evaluation, monitoring, and management of water resources.",

            "abstract": "Braided rivers are challenging features to quantify due to their dynamic morphology and dominance in remote locations. Advances in hydrodynamic modeling and remote sensing over the past few decades offer opportunities to explore braided river processes at finer resolutions with increased efficiency. These methods allow us to address questions such as: What model structure is necessary to accurately reproduce inundation extent and water surface elevations in a braided river? What effects do the smaller channels within a braided river have on simulating wave propagation and slope? How much accuracy is lost as model resolution and dimension are decreased? Here, we use the raster-based hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP to simulate water surface elevations, inundation extent, and slope at various resolutions and dimensions over a ~90 km reach of the Tanana River, Alaska. Model input and validation data were collected during two field campaigns in the summers of 2013 and 2015. Field data included water surface elevation, discharge, velocity, slope, and bathymetric measurements. Six models are run to simulate flood waves across the study reach over a two-month timespan. The model structures vary in complexity from a full 2D model at 10 m resolution to a coupled 1D/2D model at 100 m resolution where the channel is represented in 1D by an effective centerline within a 2D floodplain grid. Results from the different models are compared to assess the effects on inundation extent, wave celerity, water elevations and slope. Digital elevation model (DEM) quality and resolution have major effects on inundation extent and water surface elevations, while model dimensionality has a larger effect on wave celerity and slope. Future work will compare model outputs with AirSWOT data, an airborne analog for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which aims to provide high-resolution measurements of terrestrial and ocean water surface elevations globally.",

            "abstract": "Low temperature thermochronology is a widely used tool to quantify long-term exhumation rates and decipher landscape evolution. In this study we use the spatial variations in apatite fission track (AFT) ages along major valleys to investigate the impact of Quaternary glacial erosion in the European Alps.\nTo analyze the influence of glacial erosion on the thermochronological age distribution, we chose a study area in the Central Alps of Switzerland, which was strongly affected by Quaternary glaciations. Additionally, this area provides already published AFT ages and combined with our samples, we have a relatively high spatial sample density.\nThe major uplift phase of the Alpine orogeny occurred in Miocene, whereas nowadays active tectonics in the Central Alps of Switzerland is below the limit of detection. However, our results reveal a non-uniform AFT age-elevation trend and as these can not be easily linked to active tectonics, instead glacial erosion may be the driving mechanism. The AFT ages of bedrocks vary between ~4 Ma and ~12 Ma, resulting in an average exhumation rate of ~0.5 km/Ma for the last ~8 Ma. The age-elevation relation follows a distinct local trend along major valleys, whereby the youngest ages are not found at the lowest point. We suggest that the AFT age distribution is a result of spatially non-uniform (glacial) erosion. A simple 3D thermal-kinematic modelling with Pecube confirms the assumption, as spatially uniform exhumation can not explain this age-elevation trend. We propose that focused valley incisions occurred during Quaternary glaciations, which led to distinct thermochronological age distributions along major valleys.",

            "abstract": "Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA), which involves heating a sample and monitoring the gases released, has been performed on Mars by the Viking gas chromatography/mass spectrometry instruments, the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) on the Phoenix lander, and the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory. All of these instruments detected CO2 released during sample analysis at abundances of ~0.1 to 5 wt% assuming a carbonate source. The source of the CO2 can be constrained by evaluating the temperature of the gas release, a capability of both the TEGA and SAM instruments. The samples analyzed by SAM show that the majority of the CO2is released below 400 °C, much lower than traditional carbonate decomposition temperatures which can be as low as 400 °C for some siderites, with magnesites and calcites decomposing at even higher temperatures.\nIn addition to mineralogy, decomposition temperature can depend on particle size (among other factors). If carbonates formed on Mars under low temperature and relative humidity conditions, the resulting small particle size (nanophase) carbonates could have low decomposition temperatures. We have found that calcite can be synthesized by exposing CaO to water vapor and CO2 and that the resulting mineral has an EGA peak of ~550 °C for CO2, which is about 200 °C lower than for other calcites. Work is ongoing to produce Fe and Mg-bearing carbonates using the same process.\nCurrent results suggest that nanophase calcium carbonates cannot explain the CO2 released from martian samples. If the decomposition temperatures of Mg and Fe-bearing nanophase carbonates are not significantly lower than 400 °C, other candidate sources include oxalates and carboxylated organic molecules. If present, the abundance of organic carbon in these samples could be > 0.1 wt % (1000s of ppm), a signficant departure from the paradigm of the organic-poor Mars based on Viking results.",

            "abstract": "COVIS (Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar) is an innovative sonar system designed to quantitatively monitor focused and diffuse flows from deep-sea hydrothermal vent clusters. From 9/2010 to 9/2015, COVIS was connected to the NEPTUNE observatory at Grotto vent in the Main Endeavour Field, JdFR. COVIS monitored plumes and diffuse discharge by transmitting high-frequency (200-400 kHz), pulsed acoustic waves and recording the backscattered signals to yield time series of plume heat and volume transports, plume bending, and diffuse flow area.\nTemporal variations indicate the rate of hydrothermal plume mixing with the ambient seawater increases with the magnitude of ocean currents. Such current-driven entrainment links the dynamics of a deep-sea hydrothermal plume with oceanic and atmospheric processes. We estimate the direction and relative amplitude of the local bottom currents from the bending angles of the plumes. A comparison with currents from an ADCP (~80 m south of Grotto) reveals significant complexity in the mean bottom flow structure within a hydrothermal vent field. Diffuse flow area, temperature, and faunal densities vary periodically reflecting some combination of tidal pressure and current interactions.\nThe heat transport time series suggests the heat source driving the plume remained relatively steady for 41 months. Local seismic data reveals that increased heat transport in 2000 followed seismic events in 1999 and 2000 and the steady heat flux from 10/2011 to 2/2015 coincided with quiescent seismicity. Such a correlation points to the close linkage of a seafloor hydrothermal system with geological processes.\nThese findings demonstrate the intimate interconnections of seafloor hydrothermal systems with processes spanning the Earth's interior to the sea surface. Further, they (and the time-series acquired by COVIS) testify to the effectiveness and robustness of employing an acoustic-imaging sonar for long-term monitoring of a seafloor hydrothermal system.",

All available vertical component series are utilized to extract the Rayleigh waves. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at different periods and the azimuth distribution of the interstation pairs with high SNR are discussed. The azimuth distributions of the ambient noise source are investigated by analyzing the beamforming output. Although seasonal variations are observed from the beamforming analysis, the source distribution at 10-25 S is almost uniformly distributed in all directions, which allows us to perform the following detailed tomography safely.\nFrom these EGFs, surface wave travel times in the period range of 5 to 40 S are measured by Frequency-Time Analysis technique (FTAN). Then, eikonal tomography is adopted to construct Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps and estimate the phase velocity uncertainties. Finally, we invert the obtained phase velocity dispersion curves for 1D shear velocity profiles and then assemble these 1D profiles to construct a 3D shear velocity model.\nMajor velocity features of our 3D model are correlated well with the known geological features. In the shallow, the shear velocity of the fault is low-speed which is related to sedimentary basins, and the surrounding ridges are high-speed.",

For all three sites, multi-year time series of outgoing and incoming long-wave radiation are available from which the skin temperature can be calculated. Our analysis is focused on long-term averages of all-sky temperatures which are required to determine trends of surface temperatures.\nAt all sites, yearly averages computed from all available MODIS LST measurements are cold-biased by up to 3 °C, which is mainly caused by a significant cold-bias during the winter period. A closer analysis using in-situ observations of cloudiness reveals two main error sources. First, winter surface temperatures are systematically warmer for cloudy skies, so that the satellite predominantly samples “cold” clear-sky conditions. Secondly, the cloud detection algorithm fails to exclude a significant number of cloudy scenes, so that colder cloud top temperatures are contained in the surface temperature record. For the Austfonna ice cap, we estimate that the fraction of such cloud top temperatures could exceed 40%, which highlights the importance of this error source. Over the N Atlantic region, the number of MODIS LST retrievals varies by up to a factor of three, with highest numbers on the Greenland ice sheet and lowest numbers on Iceland the coastal regions of Norway.\nWhen assessing trends in land surface temperatures through remote sensing, three factors must be considered: a) trends in the “true” fraction of cloudy conditions, b) trends in the surface temperature for cloudy conditions, and c) trends in misidentified cloudy scenes and cloud top temperatures.\nWe demonstrate that a simple gap-filling procedure using downscaled air temperatures from the ERA-interim reanalysis can significantly improve the agreement with in-situ measurements. Such a composite product has the potential to moderate the influence of factors a and b, but cloud top temperatures due to misidentified cloudy scenes are still contained.",

            "abstract": "In the past decades, increases in summer air temperatures generate glacial-melt floods with higher than normal magnitudes, increase the frequency of high intensity rainfall events, and lead to permafrost degradation of steep rocky slopes prone to mass wasting. Continued climatic warming has the potential to drastically increase the sediment supply to the channel network. A US-Italy collaboration is characterizing response domains for drainage basins undergoing deglaciation in the Italian Alps to develop sensitivity indices of changes in flow and sediment dynamics. Six glaciated basins 85-160 km2 in size within the upper Adige River Valley are analyzed. Three study basins have multi-year data on either the spatial distribution of mass wasting and sediment production or hydrology and sediment transport over snow and glacial melt, or both. The other three basins are tested for applicability of the sensitivity indices where field data are lacking. Preliminary results indicate basin lithology and degree of sediment connectivity are the dominant controls on drainage basin response. Four broadly applicable response domains incorporate metamorphic, sedimentary, or mixed bedrock lithology with high to low connectivity. The sensitivity indices for fluvial response are controlled by valley confinement and channel morphologic changes. A historic topographic map from 1858 provides qualitative channel geometry information at the end of the Little Ice Age and glacial extent for all basins. Aerial photographs from 1945, 1954, 1971, and lidar and imagery from 2005 or 2011, along with field verification quantify valley confinement, braiding index and sediment connectivity. Key controls on sediment delivery to channels include glacially-inherited topography and the distribution of glacigenic surficial materials. Sediment cascade modeling will identify sediment sources, pathways and sinks and provide a first order understanding of basin-scale response to climate change.",

            "abstract": "It is widely recognized that past river engineering, flood control, and floodplain development activities have tended to work against nature rather than with it. The consequence in many cases has been severe degradation of our natural ecosystems. This, combined with an increased appreciation for the benefits of properly functioning ecosystems, has prompted efforts to restore rivers to a more natural state. However, most restoration projects currently focus on a narrow set of goals, such as endangered species recovery or channel stabilization. In order to shift the restoration community towards more holistic perspectives and approaches, it is necessary to improve understanding of river and floodplain hydrogeomorphic processes and their role in supporting healthy ecosystems.\nThe goal of this research was to investigate the impacts of river engineering and restoration practices on the process of floodwave attenuation. This goal was addressed through numerical investigations that allowed us to: (1) quantify mass and momentum fluxes between river channels and floodplains; (2) investigate the influence of mass and momentum fluxes on floodwave attenuation processes; and (3) evaluate the impacts of river and floodplain restoration on floodwave attenuation. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic models were applied to the Rio Grande, San Joaquin, and Gila rivers in the Southwestern United States using novel modeling approaches to describe dynamic floodplain roughness, fluxes at channel/floodplain interfaces, and attenuation along river corridors. The results provide important insights into the role of floodplain characteristics on floodwave movement and the potential for enhancing floodwave attenuation through river restoration.",

            "abstract": "In thermally stratified lakes, the greatest annual CH4 emissions typically occur during thermal overturn events. In July of 2012, Greenland experienced significant warming that resulted in substantial melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and enhanced runoff events. This unusual climate phenomenon provided an opportunity to examine the effects of short-term natural heating on lake thermal structure and CH4 dynamics and compare these observations with those from the following year when temperatures were within normal conditions. In this study, we present CH4 concentrations within the water column of 5 adjacent small lakes on the ice-free margin of Southwest Greenland under open-water and ice-covered conditions from 2012-2014. Enhanced warming of the epilimnion in 2012 lead to strong thermal stability and the development of an anoxic hypolimnia in each of the lakes. As a result, mean dissolved CH4 concentrations were significantly (p < 0.0001) greater under open water conditions in 2012 than in 2013. In all of the lakes, mean CH4 concentrations under ice-covered conditions were significantly (p < 0.0001) greater than under open-water conditions, suggesting spring overturn may be the period with the largest annual CH4 flux to the atmosphere. As the climate continues to warm, greater heat income and warming of lake surface waters will lead to increased thermal stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia, which will result in increased water column inventories of CH4. Additionally, continual warming will result in shorter ice cover durations, which may reduce the winter inventory of CH4 and lead to a decrease in total CH4 flux during ice-melt. Taken together, these results indicate that in Arctic lakes, a shortening of winter ice cover and increased thermal stratification during open-water conditions will lead to increased CH4 production, higher water column CH4 inventories and greater CH4 emissions at fall overturn.",

Despite these advantages, the index insurance has so far received low level of adoption. One of the major causes is the presence of “basis risk”—the risk of getting an insurance payoff that falls short of the actual losses. One source of this basis risk is the production basis risk—the probability that the selected weather indexes and their thresholds do not correspond to actual damages. Here, we investigate how to reduce this production basis risk, using current knowledge in non-linear analysis and stochastic modeling from the fields of ecology and hydrology. We demonstrate how the inclusion of rainfall stochasticity can reduce production basis risk while identifying events that do not need to be insured. Through these findings, we show how much we can improve farmers’ adoption of agricultural index insurance under different design contexts.",

            "abstract": "Identifying the physical mechanisms that produce the most energetic particles is a long-standing observational and theoretical challenge in astrophysics. Strong shock waves have been proposed as efficient accelerators both in the solar physics and astrophysical contexts via various acceleration mechanisms. The proposed processes rely on shock waves being super-critical or moving several times faster than the characteristic speed of the medium they propagate through (a high MA). Using recent imaging of the NASA STEREO, SOHO and SDO spacecraft, we provide the first observations of the time-dependent 3-dimensional distribution of the expansion speed and MA of a coronal shock wave. These observations show that the high-energy particles measured near Earth are produced at the time of the sharp rise in the shock Mach number (>10) magnetically connected to Earth. These findings provide direct evidence to energetic particles being accelerated during the formation of a strong coronal shock. Using our new technique, we study the longitudinal spread and timing of a number of other energetic particle events during cycle 24.",

We simulate the fluxes and thermospheric response using (1) the magnetically and electrically self-consistent Rice Convection Model – Equilibrium (RCM-E) of the inner magnetosphere, (2) the B3c transport model for electron-proton-hydrogen atom aurora in the ionosphere, and (3) the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) for the ionosphere and thermosphere. The RCM-E is a non-MHD model and does not resort to the use of a priori particle spectra (e.g., Maxwellian). The particle spectra predicted by the RCM-E agree well with observations. The simulated precipitating electron flux distributions are used to specify the energy flux and particle heating due to precipitating auroral electrons for TIEGCM simulations of the neutral atmosphere. We simulate the thermospheric response to the St. Patrick’s Day event and compare simulated quantities with in situ observations of thermospheric derived from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite.",

            "abstract": "Methane is a significant long-lived greenhouse gas, but the tropospheric methane budget is not entirely constrained. \"Clumped\" isotopologues of methane, including 13CH3D, can provide additional constraints on the atmospheric methane cycle. Interpretation of these novel isotope tracers requires an understanding of the \"clumped\" isotopic signature of various methane sources, as well as the kinetic isotope effects of the methane sink reactions.\nWe performed a series of photochemical experiments to measure the isotopic fractionation during the CH4+OH reaction. Experiments were carried out in a 100 L quartz photochemical reactor. Photolysis of ozone (O3) in the presence of water (H2O) was used to produce OH radicals. Experiments were performed in a helium bath gas. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to monitor reaction progress. At various intervals during the reaction, methane was sampled from the cell and analyzed for isotope ratios by tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS). By simultaneously measuring four different isotopologues of methane (12CH4,12CH3D, 13CH4, 13CH3D), we were able to constrain the kinetic isotope effects for 12CH3D, 13CH4, and the doubly-substitued isotopologue 13CH3D. These results are combined with published clumped isotope data from different methane sources to model the Δ13CH3D (i.e. deviation from \"stochastic\" distribution of isotopes) of tropospheric methane and its sensitivity to different sources.\nThe Δ13CH3D value of tropospheric methane does not strongly depend upon isotope fractionation during the OH sink reaction. Rather, the Δ13CH3D value of tropospheric methane reflects a mixing of different source signatures. Due to nonlinearity in mixing of Δ13CH3D, the Δ13CH3D value of tropospheric methane will be larger than the weighted average of the Δ13CH3D value of the sources. A first order interpretation of variations in the Δ13CH3D value of tropospheric methane is that it reflects changes in the relative contribution from microbial (lighter δD, δ13C) versus non-microbial (heavier δD, δ13C) sources.",

            "abstract": "An analysis is presented of the marine fog distribution based upon the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) ship observations taken during 1950–2007. Deep fog occurrence is reported in routine weather reports that are encoded in an ICOADS ship observation. Occurrence is estimated by the number of deep fog observations divided by the total present weather observations in a one-degree area centered on latitude and longitude grid point intersections. The mean fog occurrence for the summer (June-July-August) 1950-2007 was computed for each one degree point. There is a long term, deep fog occurrence maximum on the California-Oregon coast with its highest value of 16.6 % at 38° N 123° W. This fog maximum is coincident with coldest June-July-August sea surface temperatures (SST) along the coast. To compute annual averages of the maximum, a block average was based on the 19 over water grid points with the deep fog occurrences generally greater than 0.6 times the highest long term maximum value that extended along the California-Oregon coast from 37° N to 44° N. The June-July-August block averaged, annual value computed for each of the 58 summers for the period 1950-2007 has a distinct positive trend. A line fitted to the data has a deep fog percent occurrence increase of +7.4 % from 1950 through 2007 or a trend of +0.13 % per year. The Mann-Kendall test was applied and the trend is significant at the 0.05 level. The increase in long term coastal fog is coincident with a decrease in the California-Oregon coastal SST. The SST decrease is consistent with interior California land temperatures increasing, increasing the cross shore sea level pressure gradient, and increasing the along coast winds creating a positive feedback that causes more upwelling and lower SST.",

Emissions from biomass burning can vary greatly both regionally and from event to event, but previous work has been unable to fully explain this variability. Satellite observations from OMI offer a powerful tool to observe biomass burning events by providing observations globally over a range of environmental conditions that effect emissions of NOx, formaldehyde, and glyoxal. We will expand on previous studies by using OMI measurements to investigate not only the dependence of the emissions of each of these species on fire intensity but also the dependence of the ratios of these species. Fire intensity is quantified by using fire radiative power quantified by the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite instrument. We also account for variation of emissions and their ratios due to available fuel loading and fire types, which are affected by regional (e.g. biome type) and meteorological (e.g. wind, temperature, rainfall) factors. Furthermore, in individual case studies we will constrain how the chemical processing of primary fire emissions effects the secondary formation of VOCs and ozone by exploiting the temporal and spatial evolution of these interspecies relationships.",

NASA is establishing a single archive for public access to peer-reviewed publications following an appropriate embargo period. NASA has made a great effort to have data from its spacecraft openly available for many years. What is new is that now NASA will require scientists to submit -- at the time the research is proposed – a “data management plan”. This plan will be evaluated along with the proposal during the review process. It is expected that the data used in peer-reviewed publications will be archived in a persistent format. Managing data for long-term storage will be a challenge as data volumes grow, formats and media evolve, and people are increasingly mobile.

We focus our study on the analysis of the kinetic electron and ion structures in the bow shock and magnetic reconnection regions. We implemented a PIC code, called iPIC3D, that discretizes and solves the governing equations implicitly in time. This numerical scheme allows us to use time step values that are comparable to the plasma period and grid spacings that are 10-100 Debye lengths still retaining the numerical stability. For this reason, implicit PIC methods are ideal to bridge microscopic kinetic and macroscopic fluid scales. We address the problem of modeling multi-scale phenomena during the formation of a magnetosphere by implementing new algorithmic improvements of the implicit PIC method and new open boundary conditions to model the inflow and outflow of plasma in/out to the simulation box.",

We conducted three long-term transient climate change experiments driven by the CanESM2 GCM under the future climate scenarios RCP8.5, and investigated future changes in African vegetation dynamics as well as the effects of regional vegetation-related feedbacks on climate. We found that changes in vegetation over savannah under climate change not only impose important local effects on regional climate by altering surface energy fluxes, but they also produce meso-scale remote effects on central Africa by modulating land-ocean temperature gradient, lower boundary layer circulation, and moisture inflow from ocean to land, thus influencing the strength of precipitation over convection-dominant region. This emphasizes the importance of representing vegetation dynamics in regional Earth System Models particularly for the region with strong vegetation dynamics such as Africa.",

Analyses of flow orbits in an axisymmetric TC model reveal existence of a dense and bounded attractor for the maximum potential intensity (MPI) in the phase space of the TC scales, which is determined more by the large-scale environmental condition. Direct estimation of the leading Lyapunov exponent in the axisymmetric model shows further that the attractor is not simply an attractive set but is chaotic in nature. This result suggests that future improvement of TC longer-range intensity forecasts will be more realized as a result of the large-scale improvement rather than improvement in the TC initial condition. In particular, finding of the MPI chaotic attractor provides direct implication about the limited predictability of the TC intensity, which prevents the intensity errors at the mature stage from being reduced below an estimated threshold of ~ 8 m s-1.",

            "abstract": "Many alternative approaches to the Thellier and Thellier technique for absolute paleointensity have been proposed during the past twenty years. One reason is the time consuming aspect of the experiments. Another reason is to avoid uncertainties in determinations of the paleofield which are mostly linked to the presence of multidomain grains. Despite great care taken by these new techniques, there is no indication that they always provide the right answer and in fact sometimes fail. We are convinced that the most valid approach remains the original double heating Thellier protocol provided that natural remanence is controlled by pure magnetite with a narrow distribution of small grain sizes, mostly single domains. The presence of titanium, even in small amount generates biases which yield incorrect field values. Single domain grains frequently dominate the magnetization of glass samples, which explains the success of this selective approach. They are also present in volcanic lava flows but much less frequently, and therefore contribute to the low success rate of most experiments. However the loss of at least 70% of the magnetization at very high temperatures prior to the Curie point appears to be an essential prerequisite that increases the success rate to almost 100% and has been validated from historical flows and from recent studies. This requirement can easily be tested by thermal demagnetization while low temperature experiments can document the detection of single domain magnetite using the δFC/δZFC parameter as suggested (Moskowitz et al, 1993) for biogenic magnetite.",

            "abstract": "Using data from the USArray TA and permanent seismic stations we explore the relationship between seismicity and lithospheric structure in the Mid-Atlantic US where previous studies suggest the clustering of seismicity within several seismic zones. Given low strain rates, creating a robust catalog of tectonic events with a low magnitude threshold is essential.\nAnalysis of events in our study region with hypocenters determined by the Array Network Facility (ANF) during the last 2 years shows that 51% have a depth equal to zero. To assess whether the events are of natural or anthropogenic origin we apply a series of discriminants, such as, geographic correlation to known mining sites, temporal clustering and waveform characteristics. Using West Virginia as a test, we found 100% of events with zero depth are associated with mining operations. Interesting patterns emerge when comparing ANF locations of depths greater than zero with historic seismicity and events instrumentally recorded by permanent stations. Seismicity occurs in some regions where no seismic activity had been previously observed but events along the boundary between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain appear as a continuous band of seismicity making it more difficult to identify discrete seismic zones.\nEarthquake magnitude threshold is also examined in preparation for high-precision relocation of the events to better address the spatio-temporal nature of seismicity in the region. The ANF catalog shows a magnitude of completeness to 2.2 in the region. However, the ANSS catalog shows 58 events M≤2.2 in the last 2 years while the ANF catalog provides location for only 12 of those events (21%). Continued efforts to calibrate the detection and association algorithms will help lower the magnitude threshold and complete the catalog.",

            "abstract": "Some new insights into the relationship between the Coulomb stress and seismicity rate changes after the Wenchuan earthquake are gained. Three improvements are made in the calculation including employing a new triangular dislocation element method,setting up a much more realistic model and resolving stress change on variable focal mechanisms. The calculated Coulomb stress changes indicate that not only the three major faults systems including east Kunlun,southern part of Xianshuihe and Northern Min Jiang, but southern rim of Qinling, parts of the Tazang and Pingwu-Qinchuan faults were encouraged by the Wenchuan earthquake. Eastern segment of Longriba are shown to be quite dangerous due to dramatic stress increase. Ya’an was rightly located in the southwestern triggering lobe of the main rupture.Spatial distribution patterns of events before and after the Wenchuan mainshock are shown to be quite different . The observed seismicity rate changes were also calculated and compared with the Coulomb stress changes. We found that besides the three major faults systems mentioned above, east Longriba, Daliangshan, Zemuhe ,two ends of the main rupture,and some cities including Ya’an , Chengdu,Chongqing underwent a seismicity rate increase. It is in agreement with positive coulomb stress changes in these regions. The results also indicate that high background seismicity rate will amplify the effect of static coulomb stress increase. It is noticeable that a burst of seismicity near the main rupture with stress drop clearly confirmed the existence of the dynamic waves which were induced by the earthquake and lasted for the first 1-3 months after the mainshock.To check whether an event is responsive to the Wenchuan earthquake, we resolved coulomb stress changes on the focal mechanisms after the Wenchuan earthquakes. We found that only some events with long distance from the main rupture were brought closer to failure. The events with no stress change near the main rupture are associated with dynamic stress triggering and the other ones with no or negative coulomb stress change are much likely unrelated to the Wenchuan earthquake. The focal mechanism for Lushan earthquake received a stress increase by about 0.1 bar which clearly proves that the Wenchuan earthquake has effectively promoted it.",

            "abstract": "The path of global temperatures between the permanent establishment of the East Antarctic ice sheet at ~13.9 Ma and the onset of cyclical northern hemisphere glaciation at circa 2.7 Ma is poorly known. Enormous changes to terrestrial environments and ecosystems occurred approximately halfway between these polar glaciation milestones. What is perplexing is that this environmental upheaval on land occurred without any substantial evidence for late Miocene temperature change. Our single best marine index of the global climate state, the marine oxygen isotope record derived from benthic foraminifera is singularly devoid of a strong trend that would suggest notable climatic change during this time period. We present a globally distributed data set of estimated marine sea surface temperatures (SST) for the past 12 Ma reconstructed via the alkenone unsaturation method. Our reconstruction reveals what may be the strongest directional cooling of the Neogene, which occurred broadly synchronously in both hemispheres and culminated with ocean temperatures dipping to values close to the present between ~7 and 5.8 Ma before rebounding to warmer conditions in the Pliocene. The cold interval from circa 7-5.8 Ma that we reconstruct coincides very closely in time with previously enigmatic evidence of late Miocene glaciations of southeast Greenland, southeastern Alaska, and South America, with pulses of ice rafted detritus off Wilkes Land and Adelie Land and, perhaps the formation of an ice sheet on West Antarctica. A large scale forcing mechanism, such as a previously hypothesized decline in atmospheric CO2 levels from 8-6 Ma [T.E. Cerling and colleagues] seems required to coordinate the increase in late Miocene Equator-Pole temperature gradients with evidence for a contemporaneous increase in aridity on land, restructuring of terrestrial plant and animal communities, and a pronounced shift in the marine carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "The earth’s climate system has gone through major changes over time that serve as natural experiments to test our understanding of linkages and feedbacks that may come into play if the Earth continues to warm, as expected from greenhouse gas forcing. Our project investigates patterns of climate change between the northern and southern hemispheres during the mid-Pliocene epoch (~3-4 Myr ago) when the overall climate state was warmer than today. Critically, evidence suggests that the amount of ice on Antarctica was similar to today, but that there was little or no permanent ice on land in the northern hemisphere. Most climate scientists have therefore supposed that orbitally-paced climate change would initiate in the region around the Antarctic, and be driven primarily by the 41,000 year obliquity cycle. Using distributed data sets on both sea surface temperature and the combination of deep sea temperature and global ice volume recorded by ð18O, we find a pervasive influence of eccentricity/precession on Pliocene paleoclimate that has been under-appreciated. We tentatively constrain the phase of the climate response by calibrating temperature patterns to the precessional “clock” of the Mediterranean sapropel sequence. Large Pliocene glacial events were paced by precession, and coincide with minimum northern hemisphere summer insolation. This mode is in many ways the opposite of the late Pleistocene, where climate positively follows the envelope of northern hemisphere precession. In the Pliocene case, glacial periods instead followed the lower envelope of precession and nodes of low precessional variance supported peak interglacial conditions. The observations can be explained by positing that during the warmer Pliocene, the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere could only support cryosphere expansion during times of minimal summer insolation. While the presence of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic and North Pacific unambiguously confirm a northern hemisphere component to peak Pliocene glaciations, the amplitude of the ð18O excursions in features such as isotope stage M2 almost certainly requires a significant coupling to Antarctic ice volume as well.",

            "abstract": "The new Mid- and South Atlantic Planning Areas for oil and gas leasing is proposed to open in 2021. This region lacks in contemporary geologic and geophysical petroleum data and has no conventional wells drilled within the proposed leasing area. As such, addressing the hydrocarbon potential of this region is particularly difficult. Here, we use new and legacy multi-channel seismic data with heat flow observations, ocean temperature measurements, and new seismic interpretations of gas hydrate deposits to determine basin-wide heat flow along the Mid- Atlantic. These data reveal a conductive heat flow regime along the continental margin with a lack of fluid flow that is consistent with sea floor spreading rates and cooling oceanic crust. We then use these observations in combination with basal heat flow models and sedimentation records to determine the thermal history of a cross section of the Carolina Trough. These models reveal varying depth of potential hydrocarbon production that begin at ~ 2000 mbsf and extend down to depths greater than 7000 mbsf across the Carolina Trough. These potentially productive depths correspond to varying stratal ages, but all models contain the Late Jurassic, which is a potential analog to the U.S. Gulf Coast’s Smackover Formation. Additionally, the timing of hydrocarbon generation reveal that Early through Middle Jurassic evaporite deposits and Late Jurassic tight limestones should have been in place before the Early Jurassic source rocks reached a depth of burial sufficiently deep for the production of hydrocarbons. These potential seals may trap significant quantities of hydrocarbons with in the Jurassic layers, resulting in significant hydrocarbon potential within the Carolina Trough.",

            "abstract": "Using teleseismic travel time delays, we develop a tomographic model of the lithosphere beneath northeastern North America, from the shore of James Bay in Quebec to the Atlantic coast of New England and to a depth of 300 km. Three major terranes lie within this cratonic margin: the 2.7 Ga Superior province, the 1 Ga Grenville orogenic belt and the 0.3-0.4 Ga Appalachian terranes, which are bounded by the Grenville Front (GF) and Appalachian Front (AF), respectively. Additionally, the 0.8 Ga Avalon terrain was accreted to coastal New England by strike-skip faulting during the Appalachian orogeny. Our tomographic model uses earthquake seismograms recorded by permanent US and Canadian stations, the Transportable Array and the temporary QMIII deployment. All data were corrected for instrument response and record sections were examined visually to identify gross errors in response and timing. Differential arrival times of P and PKP waves were determined by cross-correlation and have a maximum amplitude of about ±1 second. In our model, lithospheric boundaries do not correlate well with geological boundaries, nor do they strike parallel to them. The seismically-fast (by 5% relative to AK135) cratonic lithosphere of North America is much thicker than that of the younger terranes, extending to 200 km or more depth but with a sharp east-dipping eastern edge located (at Moho depths) 100-250 km northwest of the GF. The lithosphere beneath the Grenville and Appalachian terranes, which were affected by subduction during the Grenville and Appalachian orogenies, is slower (by 4%). A sliver of seismically-fast lithosphere, extending to ~150 km depth, occurs along the Atlantic coast and is interpreted as the Avalonian lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Plumes from hazardous events, such as ash from volcanic eruptions and smoke from wildfires, can have a profound impact on the climate system, human health and the economy. Global aerosol transport models are very useful for tracking hazardous plumes and predicting the transport of these plumes. However aerosol vertical distributions and optical properties are a major weakness of global aerosol transport models, yet a key component of tracking and forecasting smoke and ash.\nThe Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) is an elastic backscatter lidar designed to provide vertical profiles of clouds and aerosols while also demonstrating new in-space technologies for future Earth Science missions. CATS has been operating on the Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) of the International Space Station (ISS) since early February 2015. The ISS orbit provides more comprehensive coverage of the tropics and mid-latitudes than sun-synchronous orbiting sensors, with nearly a three-day repeat cycle. The ISS orbit also provides CATS with excellent coverage over the primary aerosol transport tracks, mid-latitude storm tracks, and tropical convection. Data from CATS is used to derive properties of clouds and aerosols including: layer height, layer thickness, backscatter, optical depth, extinction, and depolarization-based discrimination of particle type.\nThe measurements of atmospheric clouds and aerosols provided by the CATS payload have demonstrated several science benefits. CATS provides near-real-time observations of cloud and aerosol vertical distributions that can be used as inputs to global models. The infrastructure of the ISS allows CATS data to be captured, transmitted, and received at the CATS ground station within several minutes of data collection. The CATS backscatter and vertical feature mask are part of a customized near real time (NRT) product that the CATS processing team produces within 6 hours of collection. The continuous near real time CATS data availability is an extraordinary capability and permits vertical profiles of aerosols to flow directly into any aerosol transport model.",

            "abstract": "Allocation of limited nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), among plant organs reflects the influences of evolutionary and ecological processes on functional traits of plants, and thus is related to functional groups and environmental conditions. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by exploring the stoichiometric scaling of N and P concentrations between twigs and leaves of 335 woody species from 12 forest sites across eastern China. There were significant scaling relationships between twig N (or P) and leaf N (or P) using reduced major axis (RMA) regression analysis; yet their scaling exponents varied among functional groups and changed with environmental factors. Evergreen broad-leaved plants had a higher exponent (αP) of twig P to leaf P than that of deciduous broad-leaved plants (1.26 vs. 0.96, p < 0.05), but they had a similar exponent (αN) of twig N to leaf N (1.20 vs. 1.19). For both N and P, legume species exhibited a higher exponent than non-legume species (1.44 vs. 0.99 for αN; 1.86 vs. 0.88 for αP). Moreover, with increasing latitude, both αN and αP significantly decreased from > 1 at low latitude (23.2°N) to < 1 at high latitude (50.9°N), and this trend was consistent among the different forest types (i.e., tropical, temperate and boreal forests) across the study area. These results suggested that, as plant nutrient concentration increased, plants at low latitudes showed a faster increase in twig nutrient concentration, whereas plants at high latitudes presented a faster increase in leaf nutrient concentration. Such shifts in nutrient allocation strategy from low to high latitudes may be controlled by temperature. Overall, our findings provide a new approach to explore plant nutrient allocation strategies by analysing the stoichiometric scaling of nutrients among organs, which could broaden our understanding of the interactions between plants and their environments.",

            "abstract": "The Doonerak fenster in the central Brooks Range, AK, exposes an important package of early Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks called the Apoon assemblage, which are generally interpreted as para-autochthonous basement to the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Brookian fold-thrust belt. Recognition in the 1970’s of a major pre-Mississippian unconformity within the window led to correlations between Doonerak and the North Slope (sub-) terrane of the Arctic Alaska Chukotka microplate (AACM); however, the presence of arc-affinity volcanism and the apparent lack of pre-Mississippian deformation in the Apoon assemblage makes this link tenuous and complicates Paleozoic tectonic reconstructions of the AACM. Previous age constraints on the Apoon assemblage are limited to a handful of Middle Cambrian–Silurian paleontological collections and five K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar hornblende ages from mafic dikes ranging from ~380–520 Ma. We conducted U-Pb geochronologic and Hf isotopic analyses on igneous and sedimentary zircon from the Apoon assemblage to test Paleozoic links with the North Slope and to assess the tectonic and paleogeographic setting of the Doonerak region. U-Pb analyses on detrital zircon from Apoon rocks yield a spectrum of unimodal and polymodal age populations, including prominent age groups of ca. 420–490, 960–1250, 1380­–1500, 1750–1945, and 2650–2830 Ma. Hf isotopic data from the ca. 410–490 Ma age population are generally juvenile (~7–10 εHf), implying a distinct lack of crustal assimilation during Ordovician–Silurian Doonerak arc magmatism despite its proximity to a cratonic source terrane as indicated by an abundance of Archean and Proterozoic zircon in the interbedded siliciclastic strata. These data are in stark contrast to geochronological data from the non-Laurentian portions of the AACM, highlighting a prominent tectonic boundary between Laurentian- and Baltic-affinity rocks at the Doonerak window and implying a link to “Taconic”-age arc magmatism documented along the NE Laurentian margin.",

            "abstract": "The crustal deformation nature during the Cenozoic in northern Chile forearc (Coastal Cordillera; CC) is complex due to the several tectonics process involved, such as plate convergence, a continental orocline (Arica bend) and great degree of coupling between Nazca and South America plates. Such deformation could be regionally explained by an EW-extension generally accommodated by trench parallel faults system (TPFS). Also between ca. 19°-22° S, a small but significant NS-shortening produce folds and faults scarps striking orthogonal to plate boundary denominated trench-orthogonal faults system (TOFS).\nThe main goal of this study is to understand the recent deformation history of the rocks units making up this part of the CC and the structural controls exerted on them by this fault systems. To achieve this, geophysical surveys have been conducted in Iquique and Alto Hospicio cities, both located in northern Chile.\nThe results obtained by Gravity and Electromagnetics Transient (TEM) surveys are consistent with the nature and geometry of geological units previously identified in the zone. Sedimentary and intrusive rocks shows high values of density and resistivity, whereas volcanic rocks are associated with high values of density but low values of resistivity. This difference could be explained by water hosted by the fractured volcanic unit. Moreover, the sedimentary units are related to low values of density and resistivity.\nA first-order feature shown by the gravity anomaly is the existence of a NS sedimentary basin filled with gravels. However, this basin presents several discrete depocentres coinciding with EW faults. This could be interpreted as Quaternary deformation of the CC. TEM data shows changes in resistivity of the subsurface suggesting different relative levels for the same lithological units. These variations can be explained by normal or inverse movements of NS and EW faults that cut and displace all the units.\nIn conclusion, results obtained from geophysical surveys and their interpretation based on the superficial geology, has allowed us to understand the deformation nature and style and the structural control that TPFS and TPOS exert on the geological units during the Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "80% of Tanzania’s population is involved in the agriculture sector. Despite this national dependence, agricultural reporting is minimal and monitoring efforts are in their infancy. The cropland mask developed through this study provides the framework for agricultural monitoring through informing analysis of crop conditions, dispersion, and intensity at a national scale. Tanzania is dominated by smallholder agricultural systems with an average field size of less than one hectare (Sarris et al, 2006). At this field scale, previous classifications of agricultural land in Tanzania using MODIS course resolution data are insufficient to inform a working monitoring system. The nation-wide cropland mask in this study was developed using composited Landsat tiles from a 2010-2013 time series. Decision tree classifiers methods were used in the study with representative training areas collected for agriculture and no agriculture using appropriate indices to separate these classes (Hansen et al, 2013). Validation was done using random sample and high resolution satellite images to compare Agriculture and No agriculture samples from the study area. The techniques used in this study were successful and have the potential to be adapted for other countries, allowing targeted monitoring efforts to improve food security, market price, and inform agricultural policy.",

Atmospherically controlled surface melt on the cluster of land-terminating glaciers in this region can be used to quantify how surface mass balance has changed in the recent decades and the state and fate of the melt water generated on the ice surface. Here, we constrain surface mass balance during 1993-present using a melt model, laser altimetry derived elevation changes and ice dynamics using ice surface velocity, over Russell Glacier, Greenland. Our preliminary results using IceBridge laser altimetry show that the Russell Glacier thinned almost three times faster during the warmer periods of 2010-2011 compared to 1993-2010. The surface melt component forms a significant fraction of the thinning rates based on observed surface mass balance rates from the K-Transect nearby.\nWe use surface melt from the melt model and the partitioned surface melt from laser altimetry to study to how the surface morphology of the supraglacial channels evolve in response to surface lowering and increased surface melt. The overarching goal is to use surface melt, thinning rates and evolving supraglacial channels as proxies of ice sheet mass balance and water budget.",

            "abstract": "Above-zone monitoring of pressure has been proposed as one of means to quality a geological carbon sequestration site by detection of leakage. Advancements in chemical monitoring, such as fiber optic sensors, will make it possible to monitor geochemical chemical parameters needed for CO2 leakage detection in the same zones. The main objective of this study is to assess pressure and geochemical monitoring for CO2 leakage detection with Montecarlo simulations at a hypothetic site where CO2 is potentially leaked into an above zone through a flawed well.\nConfiguration of the above-zone in the hypothetic site was taken from a real site where CO2 has been injected into the deep reservoir since 2008 because over three years of pressure data in the above zone has been recorded at this site. Because geochemical data in the above zone at this site is limited, we also extracted some geochemical data from the TWDB database. Threshold values (or background noises) were estimated (or characterized) from the pressure and geochemical data for identifying CO2 leakage signals in the above zone. In the model set-up, pressure, dissolved CO2, pH and salinity in the above zone caused by CO2 leakage from a flawed well were simulated with analytical approaches, depending on the parameters, such as CO2 leakage rate, permeability, porosity, thickness of the monitoring interval, distance of the monitoring well to the leakage location. More than one million set of the parameters, simulated with the Monte-Carlo method, were used to model responses of pressure, dissolved CO2, pH, and salinity which were further compared to the threshold values to estimate probability of CO2 leakage detection using the pressure and the geochemical parameters.\nOur study shows that pressure in the morning well has much shorter time to respond to the CO2 leakage from the flawed well than geochemical parameters. However, if the monitoring well was in a favorable location, the geochemical monitoring may have better responses to small leakage than pressure monitoring. This study suggests that a combining use of pressure and geochemical monitoring in the above zone may likely increase probability of CO2 leakage detection.",

            "abstract": "Data on stream material fluxes are essential for calculating element cycles (carbon, nutrients, and pollutants) and erosion rates from local to global scales. In most water-quality stations throughout the world stream fluxes are calculated from daily flow data (Q) and discrete concentration data (C), the latter being often the main cause of large uncertainties. This paper present the Pol(F)lux software tool, which addresses with two major issues: i) the selection of the optimal (minimal uncertainties) flux calculation method among 8 methods based on the flux variability matrix. ii) for the the discharge-weighted concentration method (the most commonly used method and recommended in the international convention for the protection of the North Sea and the Northeast Atlantic, OSPAR Convention), sampling frequency can be predicted to achieve a specified level of precision from the flux variability indicator (M2%, cumulative material fluxes discharged during the upper 2% of highest daily fluxes) through a nomograph for sampling intervals of 3 to 60 days. The software was validated for water-quality stations in medium to large basins (basin area>500 km²).\nThe flux variability matrix, the cornerstone of the Pol(F)lux software, is based on two indicators: (a) cumulative flow volume discharged during the upper 2% of highest daily flow, W2%, which characterizes the hydrological reactivity of the catchment during highest flow, and (b) the truncated b50sup exponent, calculated as the exponent of the relationship between concentration and discharge (in logarithmic scale) at the high-water stages (discharges greater than median flow), which characterize the behaviour of stream material. We postulate that performance is similar for stream materials found in the same flux variability class, composed of 4 classes of hydrological reactivity (W2%) and 5 classes of biogeochemical behavior (b50sup), defining 20 potential variability classes.",

            "abstract": "The eruption of Pinatubo in 1991 caused global scale changes in climate and radiation. Large perturbations in the methane growth rate were observed after the eruption, caused by variations in either methane sources or methane sinks. Natural methane emissions from wetlands are influenced by changes in temperature and precipitation, having a significant contribution to methane variability. The main removal of methane from the atmosphere is the reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). OH concentrations are in turn sensitive to temperature, humidity and the amount of UV radiation.\nIn Bândă et al. (2015), we quantified the variability in methane sources and sinks in the 5 years following the eruption, using the 3D chemistry and transport model TM5. We derived an OH inter-annual variability of 1.6% during this period. A 4.5% increase in OH levels from 1992 to 1993, caused by enhanced stratospheric ozone depletion, a recovery of stratospheric aerosols and decreased NMVOC emissions, was found to contribute to the observed drop in methane growth rate. However, using bottom-up inventories of methane emissions, the exact timing and magnitude of the observed methane growth rate variations could not be matched by our simulations.\nThe variability in natural wetland emissions and in biomass burning emissions is quite uncertain in this period. Emission reductions in the Former Soviet Union were also proposed as a reason for the observed decrease in methane growth rate. Based on the OH variability from our previous chemistry forward model simulations, we infer methane emissions after the Pinatubo eruption using a linearized inverse modeling setup. We can therefore quantify the variability in the methane emissions needed to match the methane variations observed in weekly air samples collected in NOAA's Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network and to identify the emission categories that contributed to these variations.\n",

            "abstract": "Climate models and decades of satellite data are converging on the unfortunate reality that Earth’s water cycle is changing. Paleoclimate indicators remind us that this has always been the case. Freshwater is constantly being exchanged among the atmosphere, ocean, land and ice reservoirs, while on land, patterns of precipitation, evapotranspiration, flooding and drought are shifting. The evolving water cycle of the 21st century will likely be stronger, more variable, and will result in broad swaths of mid-latitude drying, accelerated by the depletion of the world’s major groundwater aquifers. A well-defined geography of freshwater ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ is clearly emerging. What does water sustainability mean under such dynamic climate and hydrologic conditions, in particular when coupled with future projections of population growth? How will water managers cope with these new normals, and how will food and energy production be impacted? The responsibility of communicating this changing global water landscape falls squarely on the shoulders of the academic-research community, yet the challenge of doing so is daunting. In this Special Lecture I will review what our latest research tells us, and I will share my personal experiences with science communication and water diplomacy.",

            "abstract": "A variety of observations, including seismic images and seafloor backscatter and photography, indicate that active igneous sill intrusion into sediments occurs over a broad region, up to 40 km from the plate boundary, in Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. The two, young (<6 m.y.) spreading segments within Guaymas Basin are creating new igneous crust that is essentially oceanic; however, as a consequence of high sedimentation rates (1-2 km/m.y.), this crust does not have a typical oceanic Layer 2, but instead has an upper layer of intercalated sediments and igneous intrusions. The active addition to this layer over a broad region has three broad implications: it reveals something about the focusing mechanisms of melt transport from the mantle to the crust; it suggests that the role of this and other sedimented spreading centers in global carbon budgets should be assessed due to the large quantity of CO2 and CH4 released during intrusion-related sediment alteration; and, similarly, this setting provides an ideal active analogue for past igneous events for which sill intrusion has been implicated in large, rapid excursions in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry. Understanding the processes and consequences of igneous sill intrusion into sediments requires a means of quantifying both the alteration of sediments following intrusion and the thickness of intruded sills, which scales with the sill’s thermal energy. We present results of seismic analysis techniques that enable us to quantify both of these things. These types of measurements, with ground truthing from drilling results, can provide strong constraints for models of sill/sediment hydro-thermal-chemical dynamics that span a range of environments and age. We also present new seismic images of sill intrusions and subbottom images of features related to gas expulsion that demonstrate some of this range present in Guaymas Basin.",

Early warning systems, which rely on inputs from hydro-climate models, are used to help manage risk and provide humanitarian assistance to the right place at the right time. However, translating advancements in hydro-climate science into action is a persistent and time-consuming challenge: scientists and decision-makers need to work together to enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the hydrological data products being produced. One organization that tackles this challenge is the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which has been using evidence-based approaches to address food security since the 1980s.In this presentation, we describe the FEWS NET Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), developed by FEWS NET and NASA hydrologic scientists to maximize the use of limited hydro-climatic observations for humanitarian applications. The FLDAS, an instance of the NASA Land Information System (LIS), is comprised of land surface models driven by satellite rainfall inputs already familiar to FEWS NET food security analysts. First, we evaluate the quality of model outputs over parts of the Middle East and Africa using remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation indices. We then describe derived water availability indices that have been identified by analysts as potentially useful sources of information. Specifically, we demonstrate how the Baseline Water Stress and Drought Severity Index detect recent water availability crisis events in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin and the Gaborone Reservoir, Botswana. Finally we discuss ongoing work to deliver this information to FEWS NET analysts in a timely and user-friendly manner, with the ultimate goal of integrating these water availability metrics into regular decision-making activities.",

            "abstract": "The albedo of surface CO2 deposits in the Residual South Polar Cap (RSPC) of Mars controls their net condensation / sublimation over a martian year and is therefore a crucial parameter in determining RSPC stability. The albedo used in previous analyses is obtained by dividing I/F, determined from radiometrically calibrated imaging data, by the cosine of the incidence angle. Because of atmospheric aerosols, the albedo calculated from I/F above the atmosphere is not the surface albedo that enters into stability considerations.\nIn order to determine the surface albedo, we interpolate optical depths determined from CRISM EPF measurements to provide estimates of the dust and ice opacities over the RSPC (Wolff et al., 2009) and use these to determine the actual surface albedos from MARCI images using the radiative transport program DISORT (Stamnes et al., 1988). Assuming that dust is the only contributor to atmospheric opacity, the retrieved surface albedos for the longer wavelength MARCI filters in MY 28 and 29 are found to be consistent despite very different dust opacities in the two years (James et al., 2014). However, this model fails to reproduce the short wavelength behavior in early summer and suggests either an additional opacity source or modification of the CRISM dust opacity or the dust phase function. The consequences of these changes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Exploration methods for deep geothermal energy projects must primarily consider whether or not a location has favorable thermal resources. Even where the thermal field is favorable, other factors may impede project development and success. A combined analysis of these factors and their uncertainty is a strategy for moving geothermal energy proposals forward from the exploration phase at the scale of a basin to the scale of a project, and further to design of geothermal systems. For a Department of Energy Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis we assessed quality metrics, which we call risk factors, in the Appalachian Basin of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. These included 1) thermal field variability, 2) productivity of natural reservoirs from which to extract heat, 3) potential for induced seismicity, and 4) presence of thermal utilization centers. The thermal field was determined using a 1D heat flow model for 13,400 bottomhole temperatures (BHT) from oil and gas wells. Steps included the development of i) a set of corrections to BHT data and ii) depth models of conductivity stratigraphy at each borehole based on generalized stratigraphy that was verified for a select set of wells. Wells are control points in a spatial statistical analysis that resulted in maps of the predicted mean thermal field properties and of the standard error of the predicted mean.\nSeismic risk was analyzed by comparing earthquakes and stress orientations in the basin to gravity and magnetic potential field edges at depth. Major edges in the potential fields served as interpolation boundaries for the thermal maps (Figure 1). Natural reservoirs were identified from published studies, and productivity was determined based on the expected permeability and dimensions of each reservoir. Visualizing the natural reservoirs and population centers on a map of the thermal field communicates options for viable pilot sites and project designs (Figure 1). Furthermore, combining the four risk factors at favorable sites enables an evaluation of project feasibility across sites based on tradeoffs in the risk factors. Uncertainties in each risk factor can also be considered to determine if the tradeoffs in risk factors between sites are meaningful.",

Using these correlation functions, wave speed changes are measured in multiple frequency bands between 0.2 Hz and 4.0 Hz. Combining measurements performed on all 9 components provides us with a better signal-to-noise ratio, which allows us to measure wave speed changes for smaller subsets of stations and at different time windows in the coda.\nThe coseismic wave speed drop for both events behaves differently for each side of the fault zone. Moreover, the postseismic recovery behavior of the wave speed change is frequency dependent and differs for the San Simeon event and the Parkfield event. The coda lapse time dependence of the waveform changes allows us to roughly localize the area of changed seismic wave speed.",

            "abstract": "To distinguish different deformation mechanisms at hydrothermal conditions, friction experiments of plagioclase under nominally dry conditions were compared with that at hydrothermal conditions documented in a previous study[He et al.,2013]. Preliminary result[Tan and He, 2008] shows that the rate dependence of plagioclase under confining pressure of 150MPa and nominally dry conditions is velocity strengthening at temperatures of 50-600oC, in contrast to the full velocity weakening at hydrothermal conditions. Here a) we conducted data fitting to the rate and state friction law to compare with the hydrothermal case; b) microstructural comparison was performed to understand the difference between the dry and wet conditions in the operative deformation mechanisms. The evolution effect (b value) under dry conditions exhibits much smaller values than that at wet conditions, and in contrast to the increasing trend at wet conditions, b values under dry conditions have a decreasing trend as temperature increases, from ~0.007 at 300oC down to 0 at 600oC. The direct effect (a value) at dry conditions has a peak of ~0.01 at 300oC and decreases to a level of 0.007-0.008 at higher temperatures, in contrast to the increasing trend seen at hydrothermal conditions. In the dry case, microstructure at temperatures of 300-600oC transitions gradually from a fabric characterized by localized Riedel shear zones to pervasive shear deformation, with the grain size reduced to a level of 1-3 micron in a submicron matrix in the latter case, corresponding to a lower porosity. The close association between porosity evolution and that of state variable revealed in previous studies[Morrow and Byerlee, 1989; Marone et al.,1990] suggests that the porosity change contributes largely to the evolution effect in addition to plasticity at intergranular contacts, probably due to gradual switching between different densities of packing. Our dry experiments indicate a cataclastic flow where the evolution effect may be controlled by the porosity change, and the direct effect may be controlled by cataclasis. Comparing the dry and hydrothermal results reveals that intergranular pressure solution is predominant during the shearing process at hydrothermal conditions with a much stronger evolution effect that increases with temperature above 300 oC.",

            "abstract": "The Val d’Agri (VA) Quaternary basin in the southern Apennines extensional belt hosts the largest oilfield in onshore Europe and normal-fault systems with high (up to M7) seismogenic potential. Frequent small-magnitude swarms related to both active crustal extension and anthropogenic activity have occurred in the region. Causal factors for induced seismicity are a water impoundment with severe seasonal oscillations and a high-rate wastewater injection well.\nWe analyzed around 1200 earthquakes (ML<3.3) occurred in the VA and surrounding regions between 2001-2014. We integrated waveforms recorded at 46 seismic stations belonging to 3 different networks: a dense temporary network installed by INGV in 2005–2006, the permanent national network of INGV, and the trigger-mode monitoring network managed by the local operator ENI petroleum company.\nWe used local earthquake tomography to investigate static and transient features of the crustal velocity structure and to accurately locate earthquakes. Vp and Vp/Vs models are parameterized by a 3x3x2 km spacing and well resolved down to about 12 km depth. The complex Vp model illuminates broad antiformal structures corresponding to wide ramp-anticlines involving Mesozoic carbonates of the Apulia hydrocarbon reservoir, and NW-SE trending low Vp regions related to thrust-sheet-top clastic basins. The VA basin corresponds to shallow low-Vp region.\nFocal mechanisms show normal faulting kinematics with minor strike slip solutions in agreement with the local extensional regime. Earthquake locations and focal solutions depict shallow (< 5 km depth) E-dipping extensional structures beneath the artificial lake located in the southern sector of the basin, and along the western margin of the VA. A few swarms define relatively deep transfer structures accommodating the differential extension between main normal faults. The spatio-temporal distribution of around 220 events correlates with wastewater disposal activity, illuminating a NE-dipping fault between 2-5 km depth in the carbonate reservoir. The fault measures 5 km along dip and corresponds to a pre-existing thrust fault favorably oriented with respect to the local extensional field.",

            "abstract": "Volcanologists measure the concentrations and emission rates of gases emitted from active volcanoes to understand magmatic processes, which aids in eruption forecasting, and to evaluate air quality for human and environmental health. Both of these applications become particularly important during periods of unusually high volcanic unrest when it is typically hazardous to approach a given volcano. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) represent a promising platform for continued gas measurements during unrest, while reducing the risk to volcanologists.\nTwo miniature gas-sensing instruments have been developed specifically for integration onto small UAS platforms. Both instruments weigh 1 kg or less, including integrated power. The microDOAS instrument is an upward-looking UV/vis spectrometer that measures the spectral absorption signature of SO2 and certain halogen oxides in scattered solar radiation. By flying beneath a volcanic plume, the instrument can measure the SO2 content in the plume cross-section which can be used to determine the SO2 emission rate. The miniGas instrument is flown within the volcanic plume and records in situ concentrations of CO2, SO2 and H2S, as well as atmospheric temperature, pressure, relative humidity and GPS location. All data are telemetered back to the base station to immediately alert the operator of potentially hazardous conditions.\nBoth instruments have been successfully tested at active volcanoes in Alaska and Costa Rica and were integrated onto small ACUASI Ptarmigan hexacopters. A test mission was conducted at the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska. During this experiment both instruments were successfully flown in flight patterns typical of manned volcanic gas measurements and new UAV-specific measurement strategies were developed. Here we describe the instruments and platforms employed, our experimental results and observations, and make recommendations for application to volcanic settings.",

            "abstract": "“Self-aggregation” is a mode of convective organization found in idealized numerical simulations, in which there is a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed to organized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. Self-aggregation has primarily been studied in a non-rotating framework, but it has been hypothesized to be important to tropical cyclogenesis. In numerical simulations of tropical cyclones, a broad vortex or saturated column is often used to initialize the circulation. Here, we instead allow a circulation to develop spontaneously from a homogeneous environment in 3-d cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in a rotating framework, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea surface temperature. The goals of this study are two-fold: to study tropical cyclogenesis in an unperturbed environment free from the influence of a prescribed initial vortex or external disturbances, and to compare cyclogenesis to non-rotating self-aggregation. We quantify the feedbacks leading to tropical cyclogenesis using a variance budget equation for the vertically integrated frozen moist static energy. In the initial development of a broad circulation, the feedback processes are similar to the initial phase of non-rotating aggregation. Sensitivity tests in which the degree of interactive radiation is modified are also performed to determine the extent to which the radiative feedbacks that are essential to non-rotating self-aggregation are important for tropical cyclogenesis. Finally, we examine the evolution of the rotational and divergent flow, to determine the point at which rotation becomes important and the cyclogenesis process begins to differ from non-rotating aggregation.",

For the springs sampled, we found pHs ranging from a low of ∼4.8 to a high of ∼9.6; TDS (as inferred from electrical conductivity measurements) was roughly correlated to pH, with the lowest pH spring being the most dilute (373 µS) and the highest pH spring having the second highest conductivity (1384 µS). In combination with a shallow ground temperature survey and visual observations of the relative water levels in the springs, the spring chemistries support a conceptual model of fracture-controlled fluid flow in which individual springs demonstrate a surprising level of flowpath isolation. We hypothesize that variations in flowpath permeability lead to steam-heating of low-pH springs, while nearby circumneutral springs are heated by upwelling liquid hydrothermal fluids, high in chlorid and other dissolved components. If our hypothesis is correct, it implies that vaporand liquid-dominated zones of Model III hydrothermal systems can coexist in close proximity, resulting in a complex surface expression of acid-sulfate and chloride-rich circum-neutral springs.",

The speed of the camera is 50 frames per second. About 7000 unique coordinates of moving particles were determined from 3000 frames of successive pictures, the particle velocity of longitudinal and crosswise directions were obtained from the coordinates. The results show that, the probability density distribution of grain velocities of both directions are similar to that in the uniform sediment, which have an exponent decay trend, whereas the value of cross velocity of particles is clearly greater than that in the uniform sediment condition. Negative particle velocity was recognized in the experiment, it is shown that these negative may occur at two conditions, one is the backflow of fine particles behind the coarser particles, and the other is a state of movement change, such as a particle from static state to motion or vice versa. Furthermore, the particle movement was strongly affected by the arrangement of local coarse particles. The influence of coarser particles to the movement of fine particles also identified by two opposite effects, one is the acceleration effects in a ‘tunnel’ between pair of series particles, the other is the deceleration effects out of the tunnel, or fine particles captured by the backwater flow just behind a coarse particle. In addition, ensemble particle velocity in the armored bed is distinctly less than which in the fixed bed and uniform bed condition with same particle Reynolds number and Shields parameter.\n(Supported by(2012BAB04B01;NSFC(11472310))",

            "abstract": "Submarine landslide-generated tsunamis were the single largest cause of fatalities in the Mw9.2 1964 Great Alaska earthquake. In the last decade, we studied the submarine slope failures in six fjords: Resurrection Bay, Port Valdez, Passage Canal, southern Dangerous Passage, Aialik Bay, and Harris Bay. The six fjords lie 20 to 30 km above the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust, which provides an ideal landslide trigger mechanism. To characterize the landslides, we used multibeam bathymetry data, pre- and post-event bathymetry differencing, sparker and chirp seismic data, wave runup directions and heights, shear wave velocity profiles, the onland sedimentary record of the tsunamis, observations during the earthquake, and tsunami models. All slides originated at the margins of the fjords, mostly in unconsolidated sediment of the fjord-head deltas(?), and transported sediment to the deepest part of the fjords. The slides transported material up to ~15 km, resulting in slide deposits up to 20 m thick, and a subsequent megaturbidite deposit up to 15 m thick. These slides resurfaced the entire fjord bottom and the resultant flow of sediment and water brought numerous deep dwelling fish to the surface, killed by the sudden pressure changes. Typical fjord sedimentation resulted in conditions primed for slope failures. Fjord-head deltas deposited unconsolidated sediment at the upper margins of the fjords, which composed the majority of sediment that failed during the earthquake. We find that the highest tsunami runups were correlated with blocky landslides that required unique depositional conditions. The Little Ice Age (LIA) occurred between the penultimate megathrust earthquake ~900 yr ago and 1964, with the most recent maximum extent around 1875AD. The LIA glacial expansion led to significant sedimentation at the margins of the fjords. Near Shoup Bay in Port Valdez, in Passage Canal, and probably in southern Dangerous Passage, ice overrode till and sediment deposited in front of the glaciers at the margins of the fjords. In the 1964 earthquake, this consolidated sediment failed, and was transported to the fjord bottoms as large blocks, but did not disaggregate to the extent of sediment deposited at more distal fjord head deltas. These blocks of sediment were particularly efficient at generating tsunamis with high runup.",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Radar Sounder (LRS) onboard the SELENE (Kaguya) spacecraft has successfully performed radar sounder observations of the lunar subsurface structures and passive observations of natural radio and plasma waves from the lunar orbit. After the transfer of the spacecraft into the final lunar orbit and antenna deployment, the operation of LRS started on October 29, 2007. Through the operation until June 10, 2009, 130 million pulses worth of radar sounder data have been obtained [Ono et al., 2010]. Based on the datasets of the first lunar global subsurface radar sounding, Ono et al. [2009] revealed that there are distinct reflectors at a depth of several hundred meters in the nearside maria, which are inferred to be buried regolith layers covered by a basalt layer with a thickness of several hundred meters.\nBased on the further survey, Pommerol et al. [2010] pointed out the negative correlation of clear subsurface echoes with the maps of ilmenite, and suggested that dense ilmenite attenuates the radar pulse in the basaltic mare lava, and cause the absence of the clear subsurface echoes. That also suggests there are undetected subsurface reflectors especially below the young lava flow units with high ilmenite abundance.\nKobayashi et al. [2012] applied synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing to SELENE LRS data in order to obtain distinct radargram. Taking advantage of analyzing waveform data sent via high data rate telemetry from the Moon, we can perform advanced data analyses on the ground. We started providing the both SAR processed and waveform datasets via SELENE Data Archive (http://l2db.selene.darts.isas.jaxa.jp/index.html.en) since 2015.\nOshigami et al. [2014] estimated volumes of basalt units in the ages of 2.7 Ga to 3.8 Ga in the nearside maria. The volume was derived from the depth of subsurface reflectors measured by LRS. The volumes of the geologic units were 103 to 104 km3. The average eruption rates were 10-5 to 10-3 km3 yr-1. The estimated volumes of the geologic mare units and average eruption rate showed clear positive correlations with their ages.\nIn the presentation, we are going to review not only the studies mentioned above but also some recent studies such as Ishiyama et al.

            "abstract": "Rock structure heterogeneity can have a significant effect on dispersion, mixing and reaction of aqueous components in porous media. To observe the effect of pore structure heterogeneity on reactive transport, core flooding experiments were carried out for a sandstone and two carbonate rocks of different heterogeneity for eight different Peclet numbers ranging from 0.5 to 100. The rock cores were 20cm long and had a diameter of 7.62cm. A device consisting out of three annular regions was used for injection (fig. 1A). An analytical solution to the flow and transport equations for this new inlet configuration was derived to design the experiments (fig. 1B).The dispersion, mixing and reaction of chemical components were visualised in 3D with the use of chemical dopants and a medical CT scanner (fig. 1C). Local transverse dispersion coefficients (Dt) were calculated from the change in variance of the transverse distance travelled by the chemical dopant along the core. The change in variance along the core showed a characteristic pattern for each rock that was independent of spatial location. Heterogeneity was characterized by the spread in local transverse dispersion coefficients. For Peclet number 2, for the homogenous rock the local transverse dispersion coefficients ranged from 4.1x10-4 cm2 min-1 to 5.9x10-4 cm2 min-1 and for the most heterogeneous rock from 2.5x10-3 cm2 min-1 to 7.2x10-3 cm2 min-1. For the reactive transport experiments, an ICP-MS was used to measure the effluent. The core flooding experiments were modelled using both, the CrunchFlow and ToughReact reactive transport codes. High quality data sets of the space and time evolution of the concentration in non-reactive and reactive core-flooding experiments like these can be used as future benchmark test for numerical models. Furthermore, these observations can be used in the development of upscaling techniques for accurate and efficient modelling of chemical processes during flow in porous media.",

The lake has a high, unique, Fe-reducing bacterial biodiversity and it has an important relevance to evolutionary biology through its location. Furthermore it is part of the Malili lake system, which consists of five lakes. The three largest of these, Matano, Mahalona and Towuti, are connected through a surface outflow today, but the linkage may not have always existed during the past, as indicated by the high level of endemism in each lake and the active tectonic movement of the ‘Matano Fault system’.\nIn summer 2015 the ICDP-funded Towuti Drilling Project (TDP) was conducted at Lake Towuti and recovered over 1000 meters of new sediment core. Within the scope of the TDP, lake surface sediments were also collected to investigate the modern terrestrial climate and aquatic environmental conditions, as well as the major sediment input sources from the catchment area. We collected a 1 to 4 km high-resolution grid of 84 surface samples from Lake Towuti and five samples from the Mahalona River, which links the Malili Lakes. These 89 surface samples were analyzed by various, sedimentological methods including smear-slide microscopy, coarse-fraction analyses, grain-size analysis, XRF-powder, and CNS measurements.\nThe results will help to understand the interaction between the present-day lake sedimentation, hydrological and climatic conditions and to evaluate these as proxies for the hydrological connections between the Malili lakes -and paleoclimatic conditions. The reconstruction of the long-term history of the hydrological connection of the Malili Lakes due to the surface runoff into Towuti will be based on the dataset from these surface samples.",

            "abstract": "As California continues to battle the severe drought conditions, it becomes increasingly important to understand the atmospheric and oceanic conditions that may possible break this ongoing drought. Is a strong El Niño, such as the 2015/16 event, enough to break the drought? We examine in this study the possible factors that lead to extremely wet winters (the wettest 15%) in both Northern and Southern CA. The relationships between CA winter precipitation and sea surface temperature conditions in the Pacific, as well as atmospheric circulation are determined by using observational and reanalysis data from 1901 to 2010. One of the key features of the atmospheric circulation is the location of the low pressure anomaly, whether caused by El Niño or other factors. If the anomaly locates right off the US west coast, CA tends to be wet, and vice versa. Furthermore, the duration of the circulation anomaly seems to be crucial. During wet El Niño winters, the peak of the circulation anomaly is in the late winter, whereas, during non-wet El Niño winters, the peak of the anomaly is in the early winter. Thus, an El Niño that can last to late winter is more likely to cause an extremely wet winter in the state. The intensity of El Niño is another critical factor. In the wettest tercile late winter, a strong El Niño can bring about 200% of climatological precipitation to CA, while a weak El Niño can bring only less than 150% of climatology. In combination, only a strong El Niño that can last to late winter may make extremely wet winters very likely in CA. To explore the other factors, composites of circulation anomaly during wet & non-El Niño winters were also analyzed. The results show that a zonally propagating wave train, originating from western North Pacific, contributes to low pressure center and wet winter conditions in the state. Thus, coastal low pressure anomaly is a consistent feature for an extremely wet winters in California, but the origin of forcing can come from both tropics and mid-latitude.",

            "abstract": "Active tectonics of western Mongolia is dominated by large strike-slip fault systems that produced great historical earthquakes: the Bulnay fault (Mw 8.1 and 8.4 in 1905), the Fu-Yun fault (Mw 8.0 in 1931) and the Bogd fault (Mw 8.1 in 1957). Central to these faults is the Altay Range that accommodates ~4 mm/yr of right-lateral motion. An earthquake of similar magnitude occurred in 1761 and has been attributed to the Hovd fault were seemingly fresh surface rupture was reported in 1985.\nHere, we study the Ar-Hötöl section of the Hovd fault where surface rupture was described over a length of ~200 km. Detailed mapping of stream gullies from high-resolution Pleiades satellite images show a consistent pattern of right-lateral offsets from a few meters to ~500 m. At Climbing Rock, we surveyed a gully offset by 75 ± 5 m. The associated surface was sampled for 10Be profile which yields an exposure age of 154 ± 20 ka. The resulting minimal right-lateral slip rate ranges 0.4-0.6 mm/yr. However, drainage reconstruction suggests this surface may have recorded as much as 400 ± 20 m of cumulative offset. This implies the Hovd fault may accommodate as much as 2.6 ± 0.4 mm/yr, which would make it the main active fault of the Altay.\nAt a smaller scale, TLS topography documents offsets in the order of 2.5-5 m that likely correspond to the most recent surface-rupturing event with Mw ~8. A value of 2.8-3.0 m is reconstructed from a Uiger grave dated AD 750-840. At Marmot Creek and Small Creek, short drainages flow across the fault and form ponds against the main scarp. Two paleoseimic trenches reveal similar stratigraphy with numerous peat layers that developed over alluvial sands. The fault exhibits near vertical strands affecting pre-ponding units as well as a well-developed peat unit radiocarbon-dated AD 1465-1635. This unit likely corresponds to the ground surface at the time of the last rupture. It is overlain with a sandy pond unit on top of which a second continuous peat unit developed after AD 1795-1895. According to OxCal modelling of the whole stratigraphic sequence, the most recent event occurred between AD 1515 and AD 1865 with a favored time of occurrence at the end of the earlier peat development, i.e. after AD 1635. Considering known seismicity for that time window, our findings strongly support that the Hovd fault produced the AD 1761 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of the controls on ice stream flow is critical for improved predictions of sea level rise and glacier response to climate change. Basal sliding is one aspect of ice stream motion that has received relatively little attention. Although it is difficult and costly to measure direct motion at the base of a glacier, laboratory experiments can be used to recreate the physics of ice sliding over bedrock. Using a new, custom-built, servo-controlled biaxial loading apparatus, we are measuring the friction of polycrystalline ice samples sliding on rock in a double direct shear configuration. Temperature is maintained with an insulated cryostat that uses liquid cooling blocks and a programmable circulating bath. We will share results from a series of velocity stepping and slide-hold-slide experiments designed to measure key properties of rate- and state-dependent frictional behavior. The experimental conditions for the study are as follows: temperatures ranging from -20ºC to the pressure melting point; normal stresses of 20 – 200 kPa, velocities from 10-6 to 10-3 m s-1; and ambient pressure. Ice sample microstructure (grain size, porosity, purity) and surface roughness are carefully controlled and characterized before and after experiments to identify microstructural sources for macroscopic behavior. Careful monitoring of temperature at the sliding interface will elucidate the role of frictional heating/melting on both sliding behavior and microstructure evolution. By measuring rate-state friction parameters, we will explore the transition between stable sliding and stick-slip motion of glaciers and ice streams. These results can be directly compared to the differing sliding styles observed for ice streams feeding into the Ross Ice Shelf to infer characteristics of the bed interface and the bulk glacier. The values obtained from this study will provide better constraints for next generation modeling of glacier and ice-stream response to external forcing.",

            "abstract": "Modern data assimilation frameworks require sophisticated physical and radiative models to guide assimilation and interpretation of satellite-based observations. To date, satellite-based infrared and passive microwave radiances, in various scenarios, are being assimilated operationally at multiple centers around the world (e.g., ECMWF, NOAA/NCEP), however precipitating/cloudy radiances assimilation is still under active development for most observation streams. Additionally, with the advent of space-based precipitation radars (e.g., TRMM, GPM, CloudSAT) and active microwave scatterometers (e.g., QuickSCAT, ASCAT), interest in directly assimilating observed radar reflectivities from satellite-based observations is rapidly increasing.\nThe present study describes a fully self-contained forward model (forward operator) specifically designed for use in data assimilation applications of active radar observations. The model is a 1D, fully polarized, plane-parallel, adding doubling, model based on the RT4 model (K.F. Evans, 1995). The hydrometeor description is updated to include non-spherical scattering and extinction properties derived from a large database developed by K.-S. Kuo at NASA GSFC. Updated surface properties, over both land and ocean have been rigorously tested. This model also includes an explicit melting-layer model for simulating the melting of non-spherical particles, providing a continuous physical basis throughout the vertical column as snow transitions to rainfall.\nHere we present the model description, key elements, and sensitivity to the various inputs and implicit / explicit assumptions within. Examples of forward modeled reflectivities and attenuations, consistent with the GPM DPR instrument will be shown for idealized cases. Plans for implementation within the data assimilation framework at NOAA/NCEP will also be discussed.",

In addition, the launch times of dedicated radiosondes specifically fit Suomi NPP overpass times within 1 hour generally. We also use ground based lidar data provided by collaborators (The Aerospace Corporation) to validate the retrieved temperature profiles above 100 hPa up to 1 hPa. Both NOAA VALAR and NPROVS validation systems are applied. The Suomi NPP FM5-Ed1A OLR from CERES prior to the end of May 2012 is available now for us to validate real-time CrIS OLR environmental data records (EDRs) for NOAA/CPC operational precipitation verification. However, the quality of CrIS sensor data records (SDRs) for this time frame on CLASS is suboptimal and many granules (more than three-quarters) are invalid. Using the current offline ADL reprocessed CrIS SDR data from NOAA/STAR AIT, which includes all CrIS SDR improvements to date, we have subsequently obtained a well-distributed OLR EDR.\nThis paper will also discuss the validation of the CrIS infrared ozone profile.",

            "abstract": "The Naval Research Laboratory has constructed two satellites called CARINA to fly below the F-Layer ionosphere for a period of 45 to 60 days. The Space Plasma Mission will study (1) HF radio propagation in the ionosphere, (2) sporadic-E layer characterization, and (3) global imaging of F-Layer ionosphere. The CARINA spacecraft will be launched in 2016 into a 51.6° inclination orbit that has in initial insertion of 178 km by 284 km. The instruments on CARINA are (1) Electric Field Receiver (EFI) measuring electrostatic and electromagnetic waves in the MF/HF Band (3 to 13 MHz), (2) Ram Langmuir Probe (RLP) measuring the electron concentration in the 102 to 106 cm-3 range and the (3) Orbiting GPS Receiver (OGR) to record TEC in the F-Layer above the satellite. The six areas of research are (a) Sporadic-E/Intermediate Layers and TIDs with a focus on ionospheric structures below orbit and large scale bottomside fluctuations in the F-Layer, (b) global assimilation for using the CARINA OGR and RLP observations as drivers for data driven ionospheric models such as GAIM, IDA3D, etc., (c) HF propagation and radio scintillations to determine the impact of the bottomside ionosphere on HF ray trajectories for SuperDARN, ionosondes, etc., and to determine the effects of ionospheric irregularities and UHF/L-Band scintillation on GPS, etc., (d) lightning and ocean waves to directly measure lightning EM pulses and determine their impact on the ionosphere as well as derive ocean wave height spectrum from HF surface wave scatter, (e) Langmuir waves excited by photoelectrons during the daytime and high power HF transmitters, and (f) satellite drag with thermosphere/mesospheric density updates determined by orbit measurements and reentry modeling of drag coefficients. CARINA will employ ground HF beacon transmitters, incoherent scatter radars, and other instrumented satellites such as the Canadian ePOP/CASSIPE spacecraft for coordinated observations. By staying in orbit for an extended period with an average altitude of 200 km, CARINA will observe the connections between the underlying troposphere (lightning and ocean waves) and mesosphere (E-layers) with overlying F-region ionosphere. Because, CARINA will fly “where no satellite has flown before”, there will be an immediate enhancement",

            "abstract": "Transitions in the style of lava flow emplacement are recognized in the stratigraphic sequence of several mafic large igneous provinces (LIPs), including the Etendeka (Namibia), the Faeroe Islands (North Atlantic LIP), the Ethiopian Traps, and the Deccan Traps (India). These transitions, from units dominated by meter-sized pāhoehoe toes and lobes to those dominated by inflated sheet lobes tens to hundreds of meters in width and meters to tens of meters in height, seems to be a fundamental feature of LIP emplacement. In the Deccan, this volcanological transition is thought to coincide with deeper changes to the volcano-magmatic system expressed, notably, in the trace element and isotopic signature of erupted flows. We investigated this transition in the Deccan Traps by logging eight sequences along the Western Ghats, an escarpment in western India where the Deccan province is thickest and best exposed. The Deccan province, which once covered ~1 million km2 of west-central India, is subdivided in eleven chemo-stratigraphic formations in the type sections of the Western Ghats. Where the lower Deccan formations are exposed, we found that as much as 65% of the exposed thickness (below the Khandala Formation) is made up of sheet lobes, from 40% in the Bhimashankar Formation to 75% in the Thakurvadi Formation. Near the bottom of the sequence, 25% of the Neral Formation is composed of sheet lobes ≥15 m in thickness. On this basis, the traditional view that inflated sheet lobes are an exclusive feature of the upper part of the stratigraphy must be challenged. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of compound flows and inflated sheet lobes, involving one or more of the following factors: underlying slope, varying effusion rate, and source geometry. Analogue experiments are currently under way to test the relative influence of each of these factors in the development of different lava flow morphologies in LIPs.",

Bringing air into an instrument “box” almost always changes the relative humidity and loses some dust or other large particles.

In the last year it has successfully gathered data on test flights with excellent performance and signal to noise. The second instrument is a miniature cavity ring down instrument open to the air. In both cases, small instruments require decisions about just what is necessary for the measurement rather than just scaling down larger designs.

            "abstract": "The Iowa Water Quality Information System (IWQIS) was established in 2014 and provides access to continuously monitored water quality data at 53 locations across Iowa in near real time. The sensors measure and collect various surface water quality data, including nitrate and nitrite (NOx) concentration, specific conductance (SC), turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and water temperature. Using data from this network, water quality trends were compared for paired watersheds in eastern Iowa over the sensors’ periods of record (April 2015 – present) by comparing upstream land use composition and anthropogenic activity (e.g. point source pollution sources). Several water quality variables, including DO, pH, and water temperature, exhibited clear diurnal and seasonal patterns and high correlation with other variables. While the watersheds share similar topography, geology, and meteorology, the amount of urban and rural land use in each differ substantially. The watershed with a greater percent of row crop agriculture (23% compared to 15%) had consistently higher NOx concentration, as expected, and greater turbidity during low flow conditions. In contrast, the watershed with more urban land use (52% compared to 11%) exhibited flashier behavior in SC and turbidity and greater levels of each over a longer duration following rain events. Additional reasons for difference in the timing and magnitude of certain water quality variables were hypothesized. These early results reveal the value of the IWQIS for monitoring the quality of Iowa’s surficial waters and helping establish baseline nutrient conditions to assist with improving water quality in the state through the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy.",

Here, through a simple model, we mathematically operationalize a conceptual framework (Anderies, Janssen, & Ostrom, Ecology & Society 2004) that couples resource, human, and infrastructure together. The model links how micromotivators—derived from resource availability, infrastructure functionality, and outside opportunities—affect resulting societal outcomes. Conditions under which the coupled system is sustainable or collapses are clearly derived in terms of the system’s social and biophysical factors. Based on these conditions, we can quantitatively describe the tradeoffs between system performance and its robustness against fluctuation of external forcings. In this talk, model development and preliminary results are briefly reported, and potential future analyses discussed. This work is a first step toward systematically quantifying robustness, which is needed if the concept of robustness is to be used in a more meaningful way and achieve more tangible policy outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Recent multi-objective extensions of the classical shallow lake problem are useful for exploring the conceptual and computational challenges that emerge when managing irreversible water quality tipping points. Building on this work, we explore a four objective version of the lake problem where a hypothetical town derives economic benefits from polluting a nearby lake, but at the risk of irreversibly tipping the lake into a permanently polluted state. The trophic state of the lake exhibits non-linear threshold dynamics; below some critical phosphorus (P) threshold it is healthy and oligotrophic, but above this threshold it is irreversibly eutrophic. The town must decide how much P to discharge each year, a decision complicated by uncertainty in the natural P inflow to the lake.\nThe shallow lake problem provides a conceptually rich set of dynamics, low computational demands, and a high level of mathematical difficulty. These properties maximize its value for benchmarking the relative merits and limitations of emerging decision support frameworks, such as Direct Policy Search (DPS). Here, we explore the use of DPS as a formal means of developing robust environmental pollution control rules that effectively account for deeply uncertain system states and conflicting objectives. The DPS reformulation of the shallow lake problem shows promise in formalizing pollution control triggers and signposts, while dramatically reducing the computational complexity of the multi-objective pollution control problem. More broadly, the insights from the DPS variant of the shallow lake problem formulated in this study bridge emerging work related to socio-ecological systems management, tipping points, robust decision making, and robust control.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity leads to incomplete mixing. Upscaling using the dispersion tensor in the advection-dispersion equation overestimates local mixing. Modelling multi-component reactive transport leads to an overestimation of reaction rates and overall reactions. Multi-rate mass transfer was shown previously to better represent mixing. But it is still unclear under what conditions this linear model is able to represent the underlying non-linear process.\nWe study explicit multi-component transport in heterogeneous aquifers for the example of calcite-dissolution. We compare different types of heterogeneity from intermediately well connected (multigaussian) fields to very well connected fields. The fundamental difference stems from their connectivity structure. We observe for the well connected field different dominating channels with an almost uniform advective velocity while the multigaussian fields show dominating channels with a varying advective velocity. Then, we compare our results with an effective reactive mass transfer model where the distribution of exchanges rates or the memory function are derived from information of the hydraulic conductivity field only.\nWe see that reactive multi-rate models show a good agreement for the well connected fields where the connected channels are more or less homogeneous and the immobile inclusions are of more or less equal size. We find connectivity important for upscaling reactive transport in highly heterogeneous conductivity fields.",

The sample (5.125 inch length; 2 inch diameter; 0.383 porosity) was initially pressurized to 12.24 MPa (1775 psi), cooled to 1 degree Celsius, and saturated with a 7 wt% NaBr solution. A syringe pump was filled with methane gas and connected to the top of the sample at a constant pressure. Another pump was used to withdraw brine from the base of the sample at a constant rate (0.003 mL/min), pulling methane into the sample and initiating hydrate formation. Based on mass balance calculations, derived from the mass of water withdrawn and the mass of methane consumed, the bulk saturations of water, hydrate, and gas reached final values of 0.683, 0.278, and 0.038, respectively. The computed-tomography (CT) scans confirm a downward-propagating low density front, which we interpret as the front of the region where hydrate is forming and free gas is replacing withdrawn water. Assuming that hydrate formation and gas presence is limited to the region behind this front increases the hydrate and gas saturations to 0.452 and 0.062, respectively. Additional analysis of the CT scans indicates a heterogeneous distribution of gas, hydrate, and water within the core and provides insight into hydrate formation behavior and the thermodynamic state of hydrate in gas-rich, coarse-grained systems.",

            "abstract": "Radiative forcing of climate due to tropospheric O3 is very sensitive to the amount of O3 that is produced in the upper troposphere resulting from lightning NOx (LNOx). Therefore, global chemistry and climate models require accurate specification of LNOx production per flash. As part of a global investigation, in this study we evaluate LNOX production in convective storms over the Gulf of Mexico region for all summer months during the 2007 to 2011 time period. We use data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA’s Aura satellite along with detection efficiency-adjusted lightning data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). A special algorithm was developed to retrieve the LNOx signal from OMI. The algorithm takes the total slant column NO2 from OMI and removes the stratospheric contribution and tropospheric background (NO2 from sources other than lightning) and includes an air mass factor appropriate for the profile of lightning NOX to convert the slant column LNO2 to a vertical column of LNOx. WWLLN flashes are totaled over a time period (based on climatological winds) in which an air parcel is expected to remain in a 1o x 1o grid box prior to OMI overpass. The analysis is conducted using pixels with cloud radiance fraction (CRF) greater than 0.9, indicative of deep, highly reflective clouds. Therefore, the method discussed in this presentation is appropriate over regions of active or recently active convection. With this criterion, the tropospheric background is minimal. We use summation and regression methods to estimate the monthly mean LNOx production per flash over the region. Averaging over summer months during 2007 – 2011 yields a monthly mean LNOx production of 267±73 moles per flash for the summation method and 196±63 moles per flash for the regression method. These results are consistent with literature estimates and more robust than many prior estimates of LNOx production due to the large number of storms considered.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of ice sheet basal topography provide vital boundary conditions for numerical modelling of ice sheet evolution and are key to understanding observations of ice-sheet dynamics. A consistent issue with existing bed topography products for the Greenland ice sheet (developed using ice thickness observations from ice penetrating radar, interpolation, and mass conservation) is the limited knowledge of bathymetric topography close to the coast of Greenland. Addressing this issue is important as glaciers local to these regions have been observed to have the largest velocities, greatest associated mass changes, and are therefore most sensitive to uncertainties in basal boundary conditions when modelling ice motion. Poor resolution at the edges of the contemporary ice sheet poses issues, particularly when integrating models over longer periods of time. Fjord bathymetry is known to provide a strong control on ocean circulation and ice/ocean forcing so improving data coverage in these regions is further a priority.\nChannels are observable between existing maps of bathymetry and the glacier bed as derived from regions of dense point observations. Combined with information regarding former ice sheet extent, it is expected that many of these observed channels are likely continuous; however, limited observations along full channel length prevents resolving the continuous nature of these features using isotropic kriging techniques. Coupled with gravity inversion surveys of bathymetric elevation along flight lines, we have developed a refined vectorial interpolation approach using channel direction inferred from modelled velocities to condition an anisotropic kriging algorithm to resolve these finer topographic details. We present the results of the inclusion of three new data sets and application of our novel interpolation approach for bathymetry for a number of fjords and compare these results with previous versions of the Greenland bed digital elevation model.",

            "abstract": "The spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in tropical critical zones depends upon a number of variables including topographic position, soil texture, overlying vegetation, and local microclimates. We investigate the influences on soil moisture on a tropical basaltic island (San Cristóbal, Galápagos) across a variety of microclimates during the transition from the wetter to the drier season. We used multiple approaches to characterize spatial and temporal patterns in soil moisture at four sites across microclimates ranging from arid to very humid. The microclimates on San Cristóbal vary with elevation, so our monitoring includes two sites in the transitional zone at lower elevations, one in the humid zone at moderate elevations, and one in the very humid zone in higher elevations. We made over 250 near-surface point measurements per site using a Hydrosense II probe, and estimated the lateral variability in soil moisture across each site with an EM-31 electrical conductivity meter. We also monitored continuous time-series of in-situ soil moisture dynamics using three nested TDR probes collocated with meteorological stations at each of the sites. Preliminary analysis indicates that soils in the very humid zone have lower electrical conductivities across all the hillslopes as compared to the humid and transitional zones, which suggests that additional factors beyond climate and slope position are important. While soil texture across the very humid site is fairly uniform, variations in vegetation have a strong control on soil moisture patterns. At the remaining sites the vegetation patterns also have a very strong local influence on soil moisture, but correlation between the depth to clay layers and soil moisture patterns suggests that mineralogy is also important. Our findings suggest that the microclimatic setting is a crucial consideration for understanding relations between vegetation, soil texture, and soil-moisture dynamics in tropical critical zones.",

            "abstract": "Both model simulations and GMAO assimilated ozone product derived from OMI/MLS show a high tropospheric ozone column centered over the south Atlantic from the equator to 30S. This ozone maximum extends eastward to South America and the southeast Pacific; it extends southwestward to southern Africa, south Indian Ocean. In this study, we use hindcast simulations from the GMI model of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, driven by assimilated MERRA meteorological fields, to investigate the factors controlling the interannual variations (IAV) of this ozone maximum during the last two decades. We also use various GMI tracer diagnostics, including a stratospheric ozone tracer to tag the impact of stratospheric ozone, and a tagged CO tracer to track the emission sources, to ascertain the contribution of difference processes to IAV in ozone at different altitudes, as well as partial columns above different pressure level. Our initial model analysis suggests that the IAV of the stratospheric contribution plays a major role on in the IAV of the upper tropospheric ozone and explains a large portion of variance during its winter season. Over the south Atlantic region, the IAV of surface emissions from both South America and southern Africa also contribute significantly to the IAV of ozone, especially in the middle and lower troposphere",

            "abstract": "We explore the influence of major elements chemistry and H2O-content on the density and seismic velocity of crustal rocks by computing stable and metastable crustal mineralogy and elastic properties as a function of pressure and temperature (P-T). Proposed average compositions of continental crust result in significantly different properties, for example a difference in computed density of $ 4 % is obtained at a given P-T. Phase transformations affect crustal properties at the point that crustal seismic discontinuities can be explained with mineral reactions rather than chemical stratification. H2O, even if introduced in small amount in the chemical system, has an effect on physical properties comparable to that attributed to variations in major elements composition. Thermodynamical relationships between physical properties differ significantly from commonly used empirical relationships. Density models obtained by inverting CRUST 1.0 compressional wave velocity are different from CRUST 1.0 density and translate into variations in isostatic topography and gravitational field that ranges 6600 m and 6150 mGal respectively. Inferred temperatures are higher than reference geotherms in the upper crust and in the deeper portions of thick orogenic crust, consistently with presence of metastable rocks. Our results highlight interconnections/dependencies among chemistry, pressure, temperature, seismic velocities and density that need to be addressed to better understand the crustal thermo-chemical state.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is widely regarded as a promising tool for reducing global atmospheric CO2 emissions. Successful geologic storage for sequestrated carbon dioxides must prove to be safe by means of risk assessments including post-injection analysis of injected CO2 plumes. Because fractured reservoirs exhibit a higher degree of heterogeneity, it is imperative to conduct such simulation studies in order to reliably predict the geometric evolution of plumes and risk assessment of post CO2injection.\nThe research has addressed the pressure footprint of CO2 plumes through the development of new techniques which combine discrete fracture network and stochastic continuum modeling of multiphase flow in fractured geologic formations. A subsequent permeability tensor map in 3-D, derived from our preciously developed method, can accurately describe the heterogeneity of fracture reservoirs. A comprehensive workflow integrating the fracture permeability characterization and multiphase flow modeling has been developed to simulate the CO2plume migration and risk assessments.\nA simulated fractured reservoir model based on high-priority geological carbon sinks in central Alabama has been employed for preliminary study. Discrete fracture networks were generated with an NE-oriented regional fracture set and orthogonal NW-fractures. Fracture permeability characterization revealed high permeability heterogeneity with an order of magnitude of up to three. A multiphase flow model composed of supercritical CO2 and saline water was then applied to predict CO2 plume volume, geometry, pressure footprint, and containment during and post injection. Injection simulation reveals significant permeability anisotropy that favors development of northeast-elongate CO2 plumes, which are aligned with systematic fractures. The diffusive spreading front of the CO2 plume shows strong viscous fingering effects. Post-injection simulation indicates significant upward lateral spreading of CO2 resulting in accumulation of CO2 directly under the seal unit because of its buoyancy and strata-bound vertical fractures. Risk assessment shows that lateral movement of CO2 along interconnected fractures requires widespread seals with high integrity to confine the injected CO2.",

The aim of the project is to investigate the dispersal of anatomically modern humans from Africa to Europe, and a robust chronology is essential. In the CRC806, dating is provided by luminescence, palaeomagnetic and radiocarbon techniques.\nA key site of the CRC806 is Chew Bahir in Ethiopia. This lake basin is located in the source area of the emergence of anatomically modern humans. Radiocarbon, luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating have been used to develop an age-depth model for drill core sediments that date back to 115 ka over 42 m depth. The model is independent of palaeoclimatic proxy interpretation.\nOn the Iberian Peninsula cave deposits have been dated with luminescence techniques and compared to radiocarbon ages wherever applicable. Recently, existing radiocarbon chronologies on the Iberian Peninsula have been revised in light of methodological developments. Robust luminescence dating is therefore especially important in this region, where the stratigraphy is difficult to constrain.\nWe aim to improve the precision of luminescence age estimates by comparing different measurement techniques for equivalent dose and dose-rate determinations, and by using Bayesian statistics to develop age-depth models. Combining different chronological techniques has enabled the development of accurate and precise chronologies, which will allow a better understanding of the emergence of modern humans.",

            "abstract": "Southern Madagascar contains extensive sets of chevron dunes along the coast. The largest dunes extend up to 185 meters above sea level and are more than 40 km in length. While most researchers have assumed that the sand in the dunes was transported inland by the wind, we instead have proposed that the deposits are from a megatsunami event. The present data appear to support our hypothesis. We used a coulometer to determine the bulk carbonate content of 22 samples from the Ampalaza and Fenambosy dunes and their vicinity. We found that the median CaCO3 content of the dunes was over 40% with a typical range from 22 to 58% CaCO3. At off dune sites, where the substrate was exposed, and at a few sites closer to the ocean, the CaCO3 content ranged from 0% to 9%. Local beach sands contained ~ 52-54% CaCO3. At a site on the Fenambosy chevron (elevation~180 meters, location ~22 km along strike of the dune and 8.0 km in a direct line to the ocean) at the edge of a steep escarpment, the sand contained abundant marine microfossils and ~52% CaCO3. Just below the escarpment (4.7 km from the ocean) the sand contained ~58% CaCO3. Microprobe analyses of 10 carbonate fossils from the distal end of the Ampalaza chevron (elevation 68 meters, location ~42 km along strike of the dune) showed MgO contents of 1 to 6% and CaO contents of 49 to 54%. SiO2 contents are typically less than 0.1%. The bulk sand at this latter site contained ~49% CaCO3. In all cases, the carbonate fossils appear as single shells with no signs of being eroded from pre-existing, lithified rock. The low bulk MgO and SiO2 contents of the carbonate fossils are consistent with unlithified marine sediment as their source. Individual mineral grains in the dune sand are relatively angular. The sands contain abundant heavy minerals and are poorly sorted. The maximum grain size at some sites exceeds 2 mm. These observations are most consistent with a tsunami origin for the chevron dunes. AMS 14C age dates on well-preserved marine microfossils are in progress and will be reported at the meeting.",

Every year, landslide activities cause serious economic loss as well as casualties (Róbert et al., 2005). How landslides can be monitored and predicted is an urgent research topic of the international landslide research community. Particularly, there is a lack of high quality and updated landslide risk maps and guidelines that can be employed to better mitigate and prevent landslide disasters in many emerging regions, including China (Hong, 2007). Since the 1950s, landslide events have been recorded in the statistical yearbooks, newspapers, and monographs in China. As disasters have been increasingly concerned by the government and the public, information about landslide events is becoming available from online news reports (Liu et al., 2012).\nThis study presents multi-scale landslide risk mapping and modeling in China. At the national scale, based on historical data and practical experiences, we carry out landslide susceptibility and risk mapping by adopting a statistical approach and pattern recognition methods to construct empirical models. Over the identified landslide hot-spot areas, we further evaluate the slope-stability for each individual site (Sidle and Hirotaka, 2006), with the ultimate goal to set up a space-time multi-scale coupling system of Landslide risk mapping and modeling for landslide hazard monitoring and early warning.

            "abstract": "In surface wave tomography, shear velocity of the crust and uppermost mantle is routinely inversed from the phase/group velocity dispersion curves with density model empirically scaled according to the medium wavespeed. However, for some certain tectonic formations such as sedimentary basins, this scaling could lead to unrealistic density models if the relation is not properly selected. In this study, we take the Sichuan basin adjacent to the Tibetan plateau as an example to compare the different density profiles scaled from four different empirical relations and demonstrate the density effects on Rayleigh phase velocity dispersion curves. Furthermore, we use analytical equations for 1-D layered models as well as adjoint tomography for 3-D models to investigate the tradeoff between the density and shear wavespeed at various depths. In this way, we conclude that the shallow density structure has a significant effect on the phase velocities at short period so that influence the inversion for shear wavespeed from dispersion curves. In particular, a 25% deviation in the initial density model at shallow depth can give rise to an error up to 5% in the resultant shear velocity at middle/lower crustal depths. Therefore, cautions must be taken in choosing a proper density model at shallow depths when implementing the inversion.",

            "abstract": "The main product of the Global Aerosol Climatology Project (GACP) is a continuous record of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over the oceans based on channel-1 and -2 radiances from successively flown AVHRR instruments. We extend the previous GACP dataset by four years though the end of 2009 using NOAA-17 and -18 AVHRR data recalibrated against MODIS radiances according to Heidinger et al. (2010), thereby making the GACP record almost three decades long. The temporal overlap of the new NOAA-17 and the previous NOAA-16 record reveals an excellent agreement of the corresponding global monthly mean AOT values, thereby confirming the robustness of the vicarious radiance calibration used in the original GACP product.\nA comprehensive set of monthly mean AOT data from coastal and insular AERONET stations was used to validate GACP retrievals for the period 1995–2009. To put the GACP performance in broader perspective, we also compared AERONET and MODIS Aqua level-2 data for 2003–2009 using the same methodology. Monthly mean AOTs from the two over-the-ocean satellite datasets are well correlated with the ground-based values, the correlation coefficients being 0.81–0.85 for GACP and 0.74–0.79 for MODIS. Regression analyses demonstrated that the GACP mean AOTs are approximately 17%–27% lower than the AERONET values on average, while the MODIS mean AOTs are 5%–25% higher.\nThe previously identified negative trend in the global GACP AOT which started in the late 1980s and continued into the early 2000s was confirmed. Its magnitude and duration indicate that it was caused by changes in tropospheric aerosols. The latest multi-satellite segment of the GACP record shows that this trend tapered off, with no noticeable AOT change after 2002. This result is consistent with the MODIS and MISR AOT records as well as with the recent gradual reversal from brightening to dimming revealed by surface flux measurements in many aerosol producing regions. Thus the robustness of the GACP record is confirmed, increasing our confidence in the validity of the negative trend. Although the nominal negative GACP AOT trend could partially be an artifact of increasing aerosol absorption, we argue that the time dependence of the GACP record, including the latest flat period, is more consistent with the actual decrease in the tropospheric AOT.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotopes in speleothem provide opportunities to construct precisely dated records of palaeoclimate variability, underpinned by an understanding of both the regional climate and local controls on isotopes in rainfall and groundwater. For tropical islands, a potential means to reconstruct past rainfall variability is to exploit the generally high correlation between rainfall amount and δ18O: the ‘amount effect’. The GNIP program provides δ18O data at monthly resolution for several tropical Pacific islands but there are few data for precipitation isotopes at daily resolution, for investigating the amount effect over different timescales in a tropical maritime setting. Timescales are important since meteoric water feeding a speleothem has undergone storage and mixing in the aquifer system and understanding how the isotope amount effect is preserved in aquifer recharge has fundamental implications on the interpretation of speleothem δ18O in terms of palaeo-precipitation.\nThe islands of Fiji host speleothem caves. Seasonal precipitation is related to the movement of the South Pacific Convergence Zone, and interannual variations in rainfall are coupled to ENSO behaviour. Individual rainfall events are stratiform or convective, with proximal moisture sources. We have daily resolution isotope data for rainfall collected at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, covering every rain event in 2012 and 2013. δ18O varies between -18‰ and +3‰ with the annual weighted averages at -7.6‰ and -6.8‰ respectively, while total recorded rainfall amount is similar in both years.\nWe shall present analysis of our data compared with GNIP, meteorological data and back trajectory analyses to demonstrate the nature of the relationship between rainfall amount and isotopic signatures over this short timescale. Comparison with GNIP data for 2012-13 will shed light on the origin of the amount effect at monthly and seasonal timescales in convective, maritime, tropical climates.",

They serve as structural platforms to bear the weight of the backfill column, and as seals through their low fluid permeability and bond to the borehole or casing wall. High hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures, high mineral content water, and elevated temperature due to the waste packages and geothermal gradient challenge the long term performance of seal materials. Deep borehole nuclear waste disposal faces the added requirement of assuring performance for thousands of years in large boreholes, requiring very long term chemical and physical stability.\nA high performance plug system is being developed which capitalizes on the energy of solid phase reactions to form a ceramic plug in-situ. Thermites are a family of self-oxidized metal/oxide reactions with very high energy content and the ability to react under water. When combined with engineered additives the product exhibits attractive structural, sealing, and corrosion properties. In the initial phase of this research, exploratory and scaled tests demonstrated formulations that achieved controlled, fine grained, homogeneous, net shape plugs composed predominantly of ceramic material. Laboratory experiments produced plug cores with confined fluid permeability as low as 100 mDarcy, compressive strength as high as 70 MPa (three times the strength of conventional well cement), with the inherent corrosion resistance and service temperature of ceramic matrices. Numerical thermal and thermal/structural analyses predicted the in-situ thermal performance of the reacted plugs, showing that they cooled to ambient temperature (and design strength) within 24 to 48 hours.\nThe current development effort is refining the reactant formulations to achieve desired performance characteristics, developing the system design and emplacement processes to be compatible with conventional well service practices, and understanding the thermal, fluid, and structural effects the plug will have on surrounding media. This paper will report on the state of the development effort and plans for a field demonstration in early 2016 in a cased well with traditional plug seal and strength measurements.",

A recent paper [Kim et al., ApJ, 806, 32 (2015)] puts forth a steady-state model for the solar wind electrons. The halo electrons are assumed to be in dynamical steady state with the whistler fluctuations, while the super-halo electrons maintain dynamical steady-state equilibrium with the Langmuir fluctuations, known as the quasi-thermal noise. However, the model was based upon the consideration of steady-state electron particle kinetic equation. The present paper completes the analysis by considering both the steady-state particle and wave kinetic equations. It is shown that the coupled equations enjoy two exact solutions, the Maxwellian and inverse power-law velocity distribution functions (VDFs). Kim et al. (2015) had modeled both halo and super-halo electrons by kappa VDFs. Since the kappa VDF matches the Maxwellian model for low energy and an inverse power-law for high-energy tail, the fact that exact solutions represent both aspects provides the plasma physical justification for the kappa VDF.",

If these departures from gyrotropy are quantifiable they are useful as probes since magnetic topological changes are, in some sense, non-local while gyrotropy can be measured locally. I will discuss previously proposed measures of gyrotropy, give examples of cases where they give unphysical results, and propose a new measure. By applying this measure to particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection I will show that it does an excellent job of localizing reconnection sites. I will also show how gyrotropy can be quickly calculated in any case where the full pressure tensor is available. This has obvious applications to the interpretation of MMS data.",

            "abstract": "The major and trace element composition of hydrothermally altered basaltic drill core and drill cutting samples from the seawater recharged Reykjanes geothermal system in Iceland are compared to unaltered surface flows from the Reykjanes Peninsula compiled from the literature. Trace element characteristics of deep (>2000 m) core samples record bimodal compositions similar to trace element enriched and trace element depleted Reykjanes Ridge basalts. Drill cuttings (350-3000 m) overwhelmingly reflect the more common trace element enriched igneous precursor. Crystalline protoliths (dolerite dykes and pillow lava cores) are depleted in Cs, Rb, K, and Ba (± Pb and Th) relative to an unaltered equivalent, despite variations in the extent of alteration ranging from from minor chloritization with intact igneous precursor minerals through to extensive chloritization and uralitization. Glassy protoliths (dyke margins, pillow edges, and hyaloclastites) show similar depletions of Cs, Rb, K, and Ba, but also show selective depletions of the light rare earth elements (LREE) La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Eu due to extensive recrystallization to hydrothermal hornblende. Lower grade alteration shows less pronounced decoupling of LREE and is likely controlled by a combination of Cl complexation in the seawater-derived recharge fluid, moderated by anhydrite and epidote precipitation. These results suggest that alteration of glassy protolith in seawater-recharged systems is an important contribution to the consistently light rare earth and Eu enriched patterns observed in seafloor hydrothermal fluids from basaltic systems. An important conclusion of this study is that that drill cuttings samples are strongly biased toward unaltered rock and more resistant alteration minerals including epidote and quartz potentially resulting in misidentification of lithology and extent of alteration.",

We study the late Quaternary activity of the Niyang River fault by the high-resolution image data in combination with detailed field investigation, GPS observation, trenching and radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples. The GPS observation data shows that the movement characteristics of Niyang River fault is\ndextral strike-slip\nwith extrusion at present, its strike-slip rate is 3~4mm/a and its extrusion rate is 2~3mm/a. The trench at Bayi town revealed that the first terraces of Niyang River was dislocated 50cm by the fault and it is dated to be 1220±40cal.a BP.. We found that third Lake terraces of the Linzhi ancient lakes was dislocated about 1.5m at Mirui town and it is dated to be 18060±60cal.a BP.. By the fault influence, there are different elevations at the same level terraces of Niyang river and the Linzhi ancient lakes both sides of Niyang river near Bayi town. The altitude of the second terraces of Niyang River is about 20 meters at eastern side higher than western side and it is dated to be between 8860±40cal.a BP. and 9870±50cal.a BP., the altitude of the third lake terraces of the Linzhi ancient lakes is about 60 meters at eastern side higher than western side. So, the average vertical slip rate of Niyang River fault was about 2mm/a since Holocene and its average vertical slip rate was about 3mm/a since late period of the late Pleistocene. This is consistent with GPS observation data. All these data suggest that Niyang River fault is active since Holocene. So further detailed research will be necessary to determine the range of the latest activity of this fault, movement characteristics and velocity and recurrence intervals of major earthquakes. These data will be a great significance for earthquake zonation and assessment of seismic risk in this region.\nKeywords：Niyang River fault, late Quaternary activity, dextral strike-slip, extrusion",

The result is an efficient system that produces better research data products while using less resources (time, effort, and money) and maximizes their usefulness for current and future scientists.\nThe key principle is architectural. The PDS4 information architecture is developed and maintained independent of the infrastructure’s process, application and technology architectures. The information architecture is based on an ontology-based information model developed to leverage best practices from standard reference models for digital archives, digital object registries, and metadata registries and capture domain knowledge from a panel of planetary science domain experts.\nThe information model provides a sharable, stable, and formal set of information requirements for the system and is the primary source for information to configure most system components, including the product registry, search engine, validation and display tools, and production pipelines. Multi-level governance is also allowed for the effective management of the informational elements at the common, discipline, and project level.\nThis presentation will describe the development principles, components, and uses of the information model and how an information model-driven architecture exhibits characteristics of agile curation including early delivery, evolutionary development, adaptive planning, continuous improvement, and rapid and flexible response to change.",

Here we describe the use of extractable organic molecules (biomarkers) for detecting earthquake slip in fault zones. By comparing the thermal maturity of biomarkers in fault zones to the thermal maturity in rocks immediately adjacent to the fault, we can determine if the fault has experienced significant frictional heating. We present results from a number of faults from different depths and tectonic environments, including the Japan Trench, the Punchbowl fault, CA, as well as several carbonate-bearing thrust and normal faults. Models that couple newly established thermal maturation kinetics with thermal diffusion in fault zones allow us to determine the maximum temperature achieved in each fault. Even the absence of a signal allows for a maximum slip event to be estimated, because of the limits placed on heating by the reaction kinetics. We discuss the range of maximum fault temperatures seen with this method to date, and discuss implications for estimates of frictional work and slip localization in fault zones.",

            "abstract": "A powerful relativistic electron enhancement in the slot region between the inner and outer radiation belts is investigated by multi-satellites measurements. The measurement from Space Particle Component Detectors (SPCDs) aboard Fengyun-1 indicates that the relativistic electron (>1.6MeV) flux began to enhance obviously on early 10 November with the flux peak fixed at L~3.0. In the next day, the relativistic electron populations increased dramatically. Subsequently, the flux had been enhancing slowly, but unceasingly, until 17 November, and the maximum flux reached up to 7.8×104 cm-2·sr-1·s-1 at last. The flux peak fixed at L~3.0 and the very slow decay rate in this event make it to be an unusual long-lived slot region refilling event. We trace the cause of the event back to the interplanetary environment and find that there were two evident magnetic cloud constructions: dramatically enhanced magnetic field strength and long and smooth rotation of field vector from late 7 to 8 November and from late 9 to 10 November, respectively; solar wind speed increased in ‘step-like’ fashion on late 7 November and persisted the level of high speed >560 km·s-1 for about 124 hours. Owed to the interplanetary disturbances, very strong magnetic storms and substorms occurred in the magnetosphere. Responding to the extraordinarily magnetic perturbations, the plasmasphere shrank sharply. The location of plasmapause inferred from Dst indicates that the plasmapause shrank inward to as low as L~2.5. On account of these magnetospheric conditions, strong chorus emissions are expected near the earth. In fact, the STAFF on Cluster mission measured intensive whistler mode chorus emissions on 10 and 12 November, corresponding to the period of the remarkable enhancement of relativistic electron. Furthermore, we investigate the radial profile of phase space density (PSD) by electron flux from multi-satellites, and the evolution of the phase space density profile reveals that the local acceleration by whistler mode chorus could be the important mechanism in this event. The movement of the inferred plasmapause location indicates that the enhanced outer zone is divided into two portions by the plasmapause and the slow loss rate in the plasmasphere due to hiss primarily contributed to the long-lived characteristic of this event.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) has an important role in the radiation budget and chemistry in the lower and middle atmosphere as a greenhouse and reactive trace gas. The rapid developments in the agriculture and industry over India have lead to the emission of many pollutants like CO, O3, CH4, CO2, SO2 etc into the atmosphere. However, their sources, sinks and concentration levels are poorly understood because of the lack of systematic sampling and monitoring. The advent of satellite remote sensing has helped to analyze the chemical composition of atmosphere with good spatial coverage especially over tropical region which was poorly sampled with the existing surface network. This work attempts an analysis of spatial distribution, seasonal cycle and inter annual variation of CH4 over Indian region during 2003-2009 using SCIAMACHY data onboard ENVISAT. Column CH4 varies from 1740-1890 ppbv over Indian region with distinct spatial and temporal features. We observed a dependence of seasonal CH4 variation on rice cultivation, convective activities and changes in boundary layer characteristics. The comparative study using satellite, aircraft and surface measurement shown CH4 has non-homogeneity in its distribution and seasonal variation in different layers of atmosphere. A comparative study of CH4 at different hot spot regions over the globe was carried out which showed prominent hemispherical variations. Large spread in column CH4 was observed at India and Chinese region compared to other regions with a significant seasonal variability. This study points to the blending of satellite, aircraft and surface measurements for the realization of regional distribution of CH4.",

            "abstract": "We report results from triaxial deformation of porous sandstone and limestone conducted to determine the time-dependency of deformation. Experiments were run on water-saturated samples under constant differential stress (creep) conditions. In sandstone, the deformation is entirely brittle for all levels of stress and for all resulting strain rates. The strain rate during creep is very stress sensitive, with a change of only 20 MPa in differential stress producing three orders of magnitude change in strain rate. Failure occurs by localized shear faulting after an extended period of dilatant microcracking, as evidenced by the output of acoustic emissions.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of limestone is more complex. At low effective pressure, the creep behavior is brittle and characterised by the same features as observed for sandstone; a decelerating phase of creep, followed by an inflection and then an accelerating creep phase leading to macroscopic failure. Similarly, only a small amount of inelastic strain is accommodated before failure, and P wave speeds measured throughout deformation decrease continuously, indicating a continuous increase in dilatant crack damage. At higher effective pressure, brittle creep still occurs, but the details of the time-dependent deformation behavior are quite different. First, the total amount of accumulated creep strain increases dramatically with decreasing strain rate, and no localized failure occurs even at these higher strains. Second, the rate of decrease in P wave speeds during deformation decreases with decreasing strain rate; indicating that less damage is accumulated per unit strain when the strain rate is lower. Third, complementary strain rate stepping experiments indicate that the deformation becomes more compactant at lower strain rates. Taken together, these observations suggest that rate-dependent compactive deformation mechanisms compete with dilatant subcritical crack growth during creep in limestone under low differential stresses and at low strain rates. Construction of a deformation mechanism map for our water-saturated deformation experiments suggests that pressure-solution creep is the likely mechanism responsible for the enhanced compaction and change in damage accumulation with decreasing strain rate during creep of limestone.",

            "abstract": "One of the challenges in using general circulation model (GCM) output is the need to downscale beyond the model’s coarse spatial grid in order to infer climate at any particular location. Traditionally, downscaling has been achieved either dynamically, through regional climate models (RCMs), or statistically, through empirical relationships between predictor variables in the GCM and observed variables. In mountainous terrain, elevation is one of the primary controls on temperature and precipitation at the local scale, which provides the potential for topographic variables to be used to adjust climate-model output. Here, local topographic lapse rates (LTLR) were estimated from gridded climate data for the Pacific Northwest, and those lapse rates were used to downscale RCM output. Skill scores were calculated for the LTLR-downscaled climate-model output relative to an existing set of model output downscaled using the well-established statistical downscaling technique of bias-corrected constructed analogs (BCCA). Spatial and temporal patterns in forecast skill and in bias of the LTLR downscaling method were also examined. The results indicate that the LTLR method performs well in the mountainous study region relative to the BCCA method. There is variability in the forecast skill, however, most notably the LTLR downscaling technique’s better performance in the eastern part of the study region for temperature and in the western part of the study region for precipitation. LTLR downscaling offers a promising method for downscaling climate-model output in regions in which elevation is a strong control on climate, particularly for studying impacts of past or future climate change.",

            "abstract": "We consider different limits of our recently developed kinetic transport theory to investigate the potential of super-Alvenic solar wind regions containing several small-scale flux ropes to explain the acceleration of suprathermal ions to power-law spectra as observations show. Particle acceleration is modeled in response to flux-rope activity involving contraction, merging (reconnection), and collisions in the limit where the particle gyoradius is smaller than the characteristic flux-rope scale length. The emphasis is mainly on the statistical variance in the electric fields induced by flux-rope dynamics rather than on the mean electric field induced by multiple flux ropes whose acceleration effects are discussed elsewhere. Our steady-state analytical solutions suggest that particle drift acceleration by flux ropes, irrespective of whether displaying incompressible or compressible behavior, can yield power laws asymptotically at higher energies whereas an exponential spectral rollover results asymptotically when field-aligned guiding center motion acceleration occur by reconnection electric fields from merging flux ropes. This implies that at sufficiently high particle energies, drift acceleration might dominate. We also expect compressive flux ropes to yield harder power-law spectra than incompressible flux ropes. Preliminary results will be discussed to illustrate how particle acceleration might be affected when both diffusive shock and small-scale flux acceleration occur simultaneously at interplanetary shocks.",

            "abstract": "Synorogenic extension is often interpreted as gravitational spreading of thickened crust or as a response to thrust belt dynamics; however, the processes that spatially-localize extension during orogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we examine additional factors that control the location of synorogenic extension by presenting a case study from the hinterland plateau of the Sevier orogenic belt (or ‘Nevadaplano’). The Eureka culmination, a 20 km-wide, N-trending anticline with 4.5 km of structural relief, was constructed in the plateau interior in eastern Nevada in the Early Cretaceous. After its construction, the culmination underwent 40% extension, accommodated by two sets of N-striking normal faults, which exhumed rocks from depths of 6-8 km, and pre-date a late Eocene unconformity. Well-defined fault geometries, stratigraphic thicknesses, and preservation of erosion surfaces allowed estimation of the contributions of tectonic exhumation versus pre- and post-extensional erosional exhumation. Time-temperature paths determined from zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He and fission-track thermochronology collected from Paleozoic quartzite in the footwalls of two normal faults demonstrate rapid (10 °C/Myr) Late Cretaceous to Paleocene (75–60 Ma) cooling, which we interpret as tectonic exhumation during extension, and which was concurrent with late-stage shortening in the frontal Sevier thrust belt. This example illustrates that structural and topographic relief generated within zones of localized upper-crustal thickening can spatially-focus extension during orogenesis. This observation, when combined with Late Cretaceous exhumation in core complexes in northeast Nevada and northern Utah, which also developed within sites of localized crustal thickening, illustrates that gradients in gravitational potential energy, at different scales and crustal levels, played a primary role in controlling the location of late-stage, synorogenic extension within the Nevadaplano.",

First, we analyze the impact of land cover changes by applying the static land cover of 1850 and 2000 in two separate experiments that are otherwise subject to the same forcing (CRU-derived daily temperature, precipitation and reference potential evapotranspiration, 1979-2010). This land cover change alone, mainly due to expansion of crop and pasture, results in differences in annual mean discharge of over 1000 m3/s and over 10% in large areas of the world. Evapotranspiration changes reach 30 mm/month. Furthermore, for validation purposes we compare these results to an experiment that includes human effects such as irrigation and reservoirs, as well as to a default experiment with a slightly different land cover parameterization.\nTo investigate the influence of both land cover and climate change over time, we perform longer experiments applying input from the EC-Earth and CESM GCMs to PCR-GLOBWB. This allows us to extend the experiments from 1850 to 2100. We use two greenhouse gas emission scenarios for the 21st century: RCP2.6, a low-end scenario, as well as the high-end RCP8.5 scenario. Daily precipitation, temperature and reference potential evapotranspiration are bias-corrected using the ISI-MIP method (Hempel et al., 2013). First, land cover is fixed at 1850 and PCR-GLOBWB only experiences climate change from 1850 to 2100. Then, land cover is varied according to the historical reconstructions and future projections per RCP (Hurtt et al., 2011). Anthropogenic effects are excluded, so differences between these experiments are only due to land cover change. We analyze changes in discharge over catchment areas as well as evapotranspiration on cell basis. This is the first study with PCR-GLOBWB to evaluate the impact of both climate and land cover change over time for both past and future.",

            "abstract": "The chemical compositions of nearly 1000 targets at the surface of Mars have been established by the cross-calibrated Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometers (APXS) onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). Comparing and contrasting these measurements provides greater insight into martian surface processes than the standalone use of data from an individual mission. For example, the combination of MER and MSL APXS data indicate two distinct pathways for silicate weathering:   1. Open system alteration at circumneutral pH. Fracture-filling deposits in impact breccias at the rim of Endeavour Crater analyzed by the Opportunity rover show the highest SiO2 concentrations at Meridiani Planum (62 wt%) with correlated Si and Al (Si:Al ~0.3). These Mg and Fe-depleted veins have chemical signatures consistent with an Al-rich smectite and likely formed as a precipitate from non-acidic aqueous solutions. Similar high Si and Al deposits found at the Gusev landing site by the Spirit rover were interpreted as montmorillonite.   2. Open system, acid-sulfate alteration. In sharp contrast to Si and Al-rich deposits, a group of high-Si targets have low concentrations of Al. Deposits in Gusev Crater near “Home Plate,” a hydrothermal locale with nearby fumarolic deposits, fall into this category. Acid-sulfate processes are likely responsible for mobilizing most other elements, including Al, leaving behind a Si-rich, and generally Ti-rich, residue. Recent high-Si samples (up to 72 wt% SiO2) analyzed by the Curiosity rover exhibit similar chemical patterns, including elevated TiO2 concentrations, suggestive that acidic leaching may also have been an important process in the development of deposits found within Gale Crater.   The framework of chemical analyses established through years of Mars surface operations provides the basis against which future measurements by Opportunity, Curiosity and the Mars 2020 rover can be compared.",

            "abstract": "High frequency strong motion data, especially near field acceleration data, have been recorded widely through different observation station systems among the world. Due to tilting and a lot other reasons, recordings from these seismometers usually have baseline drift problems when big earthquake happens. It is hard to obtain a reasonable and precision co-seismic displacement through simply double integration. Here presents a combined method using wavelet transform and several simple liner procedures. Owning to the lack of dense high rate GNSS data in most of region of the world, we did not contain GNSS data in this method first but consider it as an evaluating mark of our results. This semi-automatic method unpacks a raw signal into two portions, a summation of high ranks and a low ranks summation using a cubic B-spline wavelet decomposition procedure. Independent liner treatments are processed against these two summations, which are then composed together to recover useable and reasonable result. We use data of 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and choose stations with a near GPS recording to validate this method. Nearly all of them have compatible co-seismic displacements when compared with GPS stations or field survey. Since seismometer stations and GNSS stations from observation systems in China are sometimes quite far from each other, we also test this method with some other earthquakes (1999 Chi-Chi earthquake and 2011 Tohoku earthquake). And for 2011 Tohoku earthquake, we will introduce GPS recordings to this combined method since the existence of a dense GNSS systems in Japan.",

            "abstract": "The transition from continental breakup to seafloor spreading is characterised by voluminous intrusive and extrusive magmatic activity, focused along narrow rift segments. The manner in which this magma is stored and transported within the crust is poorly constrained. It is difficult to answer these questions by studying previously rifted continental margins, as the area of transition is buried deep beneath volcanic and sedimentary sequences. Northern Afar presents a unique opportunity to resolve this problem, as it exposes subaerially the magma-rich transition from continental rifting to an oceanic spreading centre. The region therefore acts as a laboratory in which the geological signatures of continental breakup can be investigated unambiguously. For two years, between 2011 and 2013, a seismic network of 20 seismic stations was deployed in the area. Presented here are the hypocentral locations and local magnitudes of over 4500 earthquakes. Seismicity is focused along the western border fault and at active volcanic centres. Magma pathways beneath active volcanoes are clearly defined by seismicity spanning the entire crust. The data allows for the development of a calibrated local magnitude scale for northern Afar and provides an insight into the nature of seismic attenuation in the uppermost mantle. I discuss the implications that these results have on our understanding of the distribution of extension, melt storage and migration and upper mantle processes during the last stages of continental rifting.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the impacts of land use change on water resources in the Dano catchment, Burkina Faso, using a physically based hydrological simulation model and land use scenarios. Land use dynamic in the catchment was assessed through the analysis of four land use maps corresponding to the land use status in 1990, 2000, 2007 and 2013. A reclassification procedure of the maps permitted to assess the major land use changes in the catchment from 1990 to 2013. The land use maps were used to build five land use scenarios corresponding to different levels of land use change in the catchment.\nWater balance was simulated by applying the Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) using observed discharge, soil moisture, and groundwater level for model calibration and validation. Model statistical quality measures (R2, NSE and KGE) achieved during the calibration and the validation ranged between 0.9 and 0.6 for total discharge, soil moisture, and groundwater level, indicating satisfying to good agreements between observed and simulated variables.\nAfter a successful multi-criteria validation the model was run with the land use scenarios. The land use assessment exhibited a decrease of savannah at an annual rate of 2% since 1990. Conversely, cropland and urban areas have increased. Since urban areas occupy only 3% of the catchment in 2013 it can be assumed that savannah was mainly converted to cropland. The increase in cropland area results from the population growth and the farming system in the catchment.\nA clear increase in total discharge (+17%) and decrease in evapotranspiration (-5%) was observed following land use change in the catchment. A strong relationship was established between savannah degradation, cropland expansion, discharge increase and reduction of evapotranspiration. The increase in total discharge is related to high discharge and peak flow, suggesting (i) an increase in water resources that is not available for plant growth and the population of the catchment and (ii) an alteration of flood risk for both the population within and downstream of the catchment.",

            "abstract": "The Permafrost Carbon Feedback (PCF) is the amplification of anthropogenic warming due to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from thawing permafrost. It is estimated that permafrost-affected soils store two times more of the organic carbon that is currently available in the atmosphere. Thawing of near surface permafrost will lead to irreversible changes for environment including its feedback on the global temperatures. Previous studies of the PCF indicate emissions from thawing permafrost will start sometime in the middle of this century with a total of 120 ± 85 Gt of carbon by 2100, resulting in a global temperature increase of 0.29 ± 0.21 °C. The northern high latitudes will remain relatively cold and wet with slow permafrost degradation and even slower organic matter decay, resulting in a PCF that will persist for centuries. Few studies included projections beyond 2100, but those that did indicate 50% to 60% of the emissions will occur after. What will be the impact of the PCF on global climate beyond 2100? How much warming from the PCF have we already committed to, even if we reach the 2 °C warming target above pre-industrial levels by 2100? ",

            "abstract": "Dust has the potential to modify global climate by influencing the radiative balance of the atmosphere and by supplying iron and other essential limiting micronutrients to the ocean. The scarcity of iron limits marine productivity and carbon uptake in one-quarter of the world ocean where the concentration of major nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) is perennially high. The Southern Ocean is the region where variations in iron availability can have the largest effect on Earth’s carbon cycle through its fertilizing effect on marine ecosystems.\nPaleoceanographic records from the Subantarctic Atlantic have revealed a remarkable correlation between phytoplankton productivity and aeolian iron flux during glacial periods supporting the iron fertilization hypothesis. In addition, a recent study has shown that peak glacial times and millennial cold events were nearly universally associated not only with increases in dust flux and export production, but also with an increase in nutrient consumption (the last indicated by higher foraminifera-bound δ15N) (Martinez-Garcia et al. 2014). This combination of changes is uniquely consistent with ice age iron fertilization of the Subantarctic Atlantic. The strengthening of the biological pump associated with the observed increase in Subantarctic nutrient consumption during the high-dust intervals of the last two ice ages can explain up to ~40 ppm of the CO2 decrease that characterizes the transitions from mid-climate states to full ice age conditions.\nHowever, the impact of iron fertilization in other sectors of the Southern Ocean characterized by lower ice age dust fluxes than the Atlantic remains unclear. A series of recently published records from the Subantarctic Pacific indicate that dust deposition and marine export production were three times higher during glacial periods than during interglacials (Lamy et al. 2014). Here we present new measurements of foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotopes in a sediment core located in the Subantarctic Pacific (PS75/56-1), which allow us to evaluate the impact of iron fertilization on major nutrient consumption in the largest Southern Ocean sector.",

            "abstract": "The dual frequency comb spectrometer is a new tool for performing atmospheric trace gas measurements. Laboratory studies for atmospheric kinetics experiments and cross section measurements often use Fourier Transform spectrometers; however, these are limited by instrument lineshape and resolution. We are developing a laboratory-based dual frequency comb spectrometer as a novel instrument for these measurements. This instrument will need to be able to cover a wide spectral region and be very high resolution in order to measure multiple molecules simultaneously, be tunable, have a flat baseline for measurements of broad-band absorbers, and have a negligible instrument line shape. Thus our instrument will push beyond the limits of previous laboratory instruments, especially in terms of resolution and instrument line shape. Our instrument will run from 1.3 to 2.1 μm and we hope to detect a number of VOCs and other trace gases, including CO2, H2O, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C2H4, C3H6, HCHO, and CH3CHO. We will couple the system to 30-meter and 200-meter long-pass cells, enabling detection at atmospheric or near-atmospheric concentrations. The use of these cells will also enable us to perform kinetics measurements in situ. In this work, we will report on the performance, sensitivity, and construction of this new instrument and will show preliminary laboratory measurements of trace gases towards these applications.",

GECKO-A is used to model seven SOA formation experiments from α-pinene photooxidation conducted at varying seed particle concentrations with varying oxidation rates. We investigate various physical and chemical processes to evaluate the extent of agreement between the experiments and the model predictions. We examine the effect of vapor wall loss on SOA formation and how the importance of this effect changes at different oxidation rates. Proposed gas-phase autoxidation mechanisms are shown to significantly affect SOA predictions. The potential effects of particle-phase dimerization and condensed-phase photolysis are investigated.

            "abstract": "Subducting slabs recycle rocks into the deep Earth releasing fluids which may cause partial melting and possible oxidation of the mantle wedge. Recent theoretical studies1 indicate that at pressures greater than about 3.0 GPa these fluids could contain high concentrations of organic and inorganic C-species with a wide range of C-oxidation states at equilibrium. If so, such fluids could play an important role in the deep carbon cycle, including the formation of diamond. However, direct experimental observations of the speciation in the fluids are needed.\nWe studied 1.0 M aqueous Na-formate and 1.0 M Na-acetate solutions in the diamond anvil cell using Raman spectroscopy at 300 ºC and 3.0 GPa for up to 60 hours. Our preliminary results indicate that formate rapidly decomposed to bicarbonate/carbonate species and methane, with no detectable H2. Acetate decomposed much more slowly. Within the first two hours of heating, crystals of Na2CO3 precipitated in the fluid, and kept growing while immiscible droplets of hydrocarbon appeared and persisted throughout the experiments at elevated temperature and pressure. In the aqueous fluid, acetate and HCO3- were present during the first 6 hours, and then CO32- and acetate after 20 hours of heating. The final HCO3- /CO32- ratio was constant indicating a constant pH.\nThis is the first in situ observation of persistent immiscible fluid hydrocarbons formed from an aqueous precursor at upper mantle pressures. Our results suggest that Earth’s subduction zone fluids at high pressures might involve fluid hydrocarbon species as well as inorganic and organic aqueous C-species, which considerably broadens the picture of deep carbon sources, cycles and sinks.\n[1] Sverjensky et at.

            "abstract": "Extreme climatic events such as drought, 100-year floods, etc. can change the state of an ecosystem that is already in flux. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California is one of the most modified estuaries in the world. The hydrology of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta has been extensively altered by a network of levees, dams, and canals implemented through federal and state reclamation projects. These changes have made its ecosystem vulnerable to invasion by eliminating the competitive advantage of low-nutrient brackish-adapted native species via nutrient loading and reduced salinity which favor opportunistic species. The extreme drought in California since 2010 has likely increased shallow habitat with slow moving water, and the mild winters and lack of large storms have also favored the spread of non-native species.\nSix years of hyperspectral data of the Delta spread over a period of 11 years (HyMap data from 2004 to 2008, and AVIRIS-NG data in 2014) offer a unique opportunity to study the invasive species distribution in the Delta. In 2004, two aggressive freshwater invasive species were flourishing in the Delta: the floating species, Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) and the submerged species, Egeria densa (Brazilian waterweed). A third invasive floating genus Ludwigia spp. (water primrose) was just beginning to establish itself in the northwest portion of the Delta. We classified these invasive species for all six years of data. Our results show that from 2004 to 2008, floating and submerged vegetation decreased overall. Among floating species, Eichhornia crassipes was co-dominant with Hydrocotyle spp., a native floating macrophyte. From 2008 to 2014 however, the total area covered by floating macrophytes in the Delta increased many-fold from 320 to 2610 hectares. The composition of this functional group also changed. Native Hydrocotyle cover reduced drastically and Ludwigia replaced it as the co-dominant comprising a third of all floating macrophyte cover. Submerged macrophyte cover stayed relatively constant and dominated by Egeria densa. There might be multiple reasons in addition to drought for this shift in the distribution and abundance of the floating macrophyte community. More studies are needed to establish the relative importance of the California drought as compared to other factors.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding challenge for ionosphere-thermosphere models has been the inclusion of accurate and self-consistent electrodynamic inputs in the auroral zone. Phenomenon such as penetration electric fields (PEFs), storm enhanced densities (SEDs), and sub-auroral polarization streams (SAPS) are inextricably linked to the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. To address this, the global ionosphere-thermosphere model (GITM) has been coupled to the hot electron ion drift integrator (HEIDI) model of the inner magnetosphere and ring current. However, since the electrodynamic system is strongly dependent on the ionospheric conductance, HEIDI was first updated to include a self-consistent auroral model. HEIDI now calculates the total energy flux and average energy in the auroral zone by calculating the flux of electrons in the loss cone at each time-step. These are used with the Robinson formula to derive the Hall and Pedersen conductances as well as in the potential solver, along with the field-aligned currents, to generate an electric potential pattern which is subsequently used to advect the particles in HEIDI. The resulting aurora and potentials are then used to drive GITM in a one-way coupling. HEIDI and GITM were run for multiple storms using this configuration, and a number of phenomena were investigated, such as PEFs, SEDs and SAPS, as well as their influence on the thermospheric temperature, density and wind structure. Simulations of real storms were compared to incoherent scatter radar, GPS TEC, and satellite data to understand the differences between the old and new model results.",

            "abstract": "The south-eastward expansion of Tibet plateau in eastern Tibet is considered a key process for understanding the large scale uplift and crustal thickening without significant concomitant crustal shortening. However, the geodynamic processes creating this iconic process is still unclear and hotly debated. Two popular geodynamic models, namely crustal flow at mid-to-lower crustal depths and coherent deformation between the crust and lithospheric mantle, are commonly appealed to as the expansion’s driving mechanism. However, neither of these mechanisms is able to reconcile all of the abundant geological and geophysical data. In this study we present a three-dimensional (3D) geo-electrical model, derived from SINOPROBE magnetotelluric (MT) array data, which reveals the geo-electrical and rheological structure in southeast Tibet that brings new insights into the region. Instead of continuous NW-SE conductive channels proposed in previous two-dimensional (2D) MT studies, a large-scale N-S directed resistive structure is revealed to disconnect the conductors from the crust to the upper mantle, arguing against the model of south-eastward (downslope) channel flow. Furthermore, distinct NNE directed conductive anomalies, which are perpendicular to the surface structures, are identified in the mid-to-lower crust. We interpret these anomalies as distributed NNE oriented crustal flow channels, which might cause the azimuthal clockwise extension around East Himalayan Syntax and partly contributed to the south-eastward expansion of eastern Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Forests are transformed by drought as water availability drops below levels where trees of different sizes and species can maintain productivity and survive. Physiological studies have provided detailed understanding of how species differences affect drought vulnerability but they offer almost no insights about the amount of water different trees can access beyond general statements about rooting depth. While canopy architecture provides strong evidence for light availability aboveground, belowground moisture availability remains essentially unknown. For example, do larger trees always have greater access to soil moisture? In temperate mixed forests, the ability to access a large soil moisture pool could minimize damage during drought events and facilitate post-drought recovery, potentially at the expense of neighboring trees. We show that the pool of accessible soil moisture can be estimated for trees with data on whole-plant transpiration and that this data can be used to predict water availability for forest stands. We estimate soil water availability with a Bayesian state-space model based on a simple water balance, where cumulative depressions in water use below potential transpiration indicate soil resource depletion. We compare trees of different sizes and species, extend these findings to the entire stand, and connect them to our recent research showing that tree survival after drought depends on post-drought growth recovery and local moisture availability. These results can be used to predict competitive abilities for soil water, understand ecohydrological variation within stands, and identify trees that are at risk of damage from future drought events.",

            "abstract": "In West Africa, the drought initiated in the 70’s-80’s together with intense land-use change due to increasing food demand produced very contrasted responses on water budgets of the critical zone (CZ) depending on the lithological and pedological contexts. In Sahel, streamflow increased, mostly due to increasing hortonian runoff from soil crusting, and so did groundwater storage. On the contrary, in the more humid southern Sudanian area, streamflow decreased and no clear signal has been observed concerning water storage in this hard-rock basement area. There, Bas-fonds are fundamental landscape features. They are seasonally water-logged valley bottoms from which first order streams originate, mostly composed of baseflow. They are a key feature for understanding streamflow generation processes. They also carry an important agronomic potential due to their moisture and nutrient availability.\nThe role of Bas-fond in streamflow generation processes is investigated using a physically-based coupled model of the CZ, ParFlow-CLM at catchment scale (10km²). The model is evaluated against classical hydrological measurements (water table, soil moisture, streamflow, fluxes), acquired in the AMMA-CATCH observing system for the West African monsoon, but also hybrid gravity data which measure integrated water storage changes. The bas-fond system is shown to be composed of two components with different time scales. The slow component is characterized by the seasonal and interannual amplitude of the permanent water table, which is disconnected from streams, fed by direct recharge and lowered by evapotranspiration, mostly from riparian areas. The fast component is characterized by thresholds in storage and perched and permanent water tables surrounding the bas-fond during the wet season, which are linked with baseflow generation. This is a first step toward integrating these features into larger scale modeling of the critical zone for evaluating the effect of precipitation intensification and land use changes scenarios in the area.",

            "abstract": "The ability of a suite of NASA produced high-resolution downscaled climate model simulations to reproduce observed impact characteristics of winter storms over the Northeastern United States is evaluated. Simulations are produced using the NASA-Unified Weather Forecasting and Research (NU-WRF) regional climate model (RCM) and a downscaled version of the GEOS5 global climate model with boundary conditions provided by the second version of NASA’s Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis. The RCM is run at 24, 12, and 4 km horizontal grid resolutions over North America with and without spectral nudging and the GEOS5 run is produced at 12.5 km and nudged to MERRA. Storm impact metrics for model evaluation are based on individual events defined at each grid cell as one or more consecutive days with measureable precipitation. Impact metrics include storm frequency, intensity, duration, and total storm accumulated precipitation. Impact metrics are computed for all storms and separately for storms occurring when the concurrent temperature is below freezing, to gauge the ability of the models to simulate realistic partitioning of frozen and liquid precipitation in the storm climatology. Preliminary results suggest that all simulations capture the key geospatial features of the storm impact metrics at all grid resolutions and for both nudged and non-nudged runs. However, the RCMs have an overall systematic high bias in storm frequency, intensity, duration, and total precipitation. Some improvement in model skill is apparent in the nudged simulations over the non-nudged simulations, however such improvements are small. While higher resolution is able to capture more detail, including orographic effects on precipitation type and intensity, it is not clear whether higher resolution necessarily leads to improved simulation of Northeastern US winter storm impacts.",

It takes considerable time, therefore, for the solar wind to propagate such lengths down the tail. This propagation time is much greater than typical periods between changes in direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We expect these variable magnetic fields to create a jumbled structure in Jupiter’s magnetotail, resulting in magnetic reconnection and other magnetic processes. We simulate the global interaction of the solar wind with Jupiter’s magnetosphere using a 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code. Delamere & Bagenal (2010) argue that the interaction is largely viscous, so we simulate the jovian magnetosphere as a region where the momentum equation has an added loss term.

            "abstract": "The North-East Corridor project aims to use a top-down inversion methodology to quantify sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions over urban domains such as Washington DC / Baltimore with high spatial and temporal resolution. Atmospheric transport of tracer gases from an emission source to a tower mounted receptor are usually conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. For such simulations, WRF employs a parameterized turbulence model and does not resolve the fine scale dynamics generated by the flow around buildings and communities comprising a large city. The NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is a computational fluid dynamics model that utilizes large eddy simulation methods to model flow around buildings at length scales much smaller than is practical with WRF. FDS has the potential to evaluate the impact of complex urban topography on near-field dispersion and mixing difficult to simulate with a mesoscale atmospheric model. Such capabilities may be important in determining urban GHG emissions using atmospheric measurements.\n A methodology has been developed to run FDS as a sub-grid scale model within a WRF simulation. The coupling is based on nudging the FDS flow field towards that computed by WRF, and is currently limited to one way coupling performed in an off-line mode. Using the coupled WRF / FDS model, NIST will investigate the effects of the urban canopy at horizontal resolutions of 10-20 m in a domain of 12 x 12 km. The coupled WRF-FDS simulations will be used to calculate the dispersion of tracer gases in the North-East Corridor and to evaluate the upwind areas that contribute to tower observations, referred to in the inversion community as influence functions. Results of this study will provide guidance regarding the importance of explicit simulations of urban atmospheric turbulence in obtaining accurate estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and transport.",

            "abstract": "The tremor detectors developed for accurately locating tectonic tremor in Cascadia [Armbruster et al., JGR 2014] have been applied to data from the HINET seismic network in Japan. In the overview by Obara [Science 2002] there are three strong sources of tectonic tremor in southwest Japan: Shikoku, Kii Pen. and Tokai. The daily epicentral distributions of tremor on the HINET web site allow the identification of days when tremor in each source is active. The worst results were obtained in Shikoku, in spite of the high level of tremor activity observed there by others. This method requires a clear direct arrival of the S and P waves at the stations for coherence to be seen, so scattering and shear wave splitting are possible reasons for poor results there. Relatively wide station spacing, 19-30 km, is another possible reason. The best results were obtained in Tokai with stations STR, HRY and TYE spacing 18-19 km, and Kii Pen. with stations KRT, HYS and KAW spacing 15-22 km. In both of those areas the three station detectors see strong episodes of tremor. If detections with three stations are located by constraining them to the plate interface, a pattern of persistent sources is seen, with some intense sources. This is similar to what was seen in Cascadia. Detections with four stations give S and P arrival times of high accuracy. In Tokai the hypocenters form a narrow, 2-3 km thick, zone dipping to the north, consistent with the plate interface there. In Kii Pen. the hypocenters dip to the northwest in a thin, 2-3 km thick, zone but approximately 5 km shallower than a plate interface model for this area [Yoshioka and Murakami, GJI 2007]. The overlap of tremor sources in the 12 years analyzed here suggests relative hypocentral location errors as small as 2-3 km. We conclude that the methods developed in Cascadia will work in Japan but the typical spacing of HINET stations, ~20 km, is greater than the optimum distance found in analysis of data from Cascadia, 8 to 15 km.",

Steady phosphorus loading from manure production and other sources has contributed directly to blue-green algae blooms and poor water quality in the lakes and river system, and is often viewed as the most important environmental problem to solve in the region. In this study, the daily streamflow and monthly nitrogen (N), sediment and phosphorus (P) transport, as well as the lake levels in the Yahara River basin are simulated using a physically-based hydrologic routing model: the Terrestrial Hydrology Model with Biogeochemistry (THMB). The original model includes representation of water and nitrogen transport but as part of this work, P transport and lake regulation are added into the model. The modified THMB model is coupled with the AgroIBIS-VSF agroecosystem model to represent dynamic coupling between agricultural management in the watershed, and N, P, and sediment transport to lakes and streams. We will present model calibration and validation results that demonstrate the hydrologic routing capability of THMB for a spatial resolution of 220m, several orders of magnitude finer than attempted previously with THMB. The calibrated modeling system is being used to simulate the impacts of climate change and land management on biogeochemistry in the Yahara watershed under four different pathways of change to the year 2070 (Yahara 2070).

            "abstract": "Tidal fluctuation and wave pumping control the groundwater discharge and solute transport from the coastal aquifers to the sea. This discharged groundwater and solute flux could cause significant geochemical evolution at the groundwater-seawater (GW-SW) interaction zone, and have a potential impact on marine ecosystems. In this study we have tried to trace these tidal influences on discharging groundwater flow path and its quality at the Bay of Bengal, India by using numerical modelling. We have done multi-season time-series sea-bed porewater sampling from nested wells throughout a tidal cycle, along with groundwater sampling from the tube-wells in the vicinity, aquifer parameter estimation and beach geomorphology, to delineate the variations of solute chemistry within a tidal cycle. Numerical modelled data suggest that the tidal pumping at the study area leads seawater intrusion in the backshore aquifers. The local geology and low beach slope (<1°) also accentuate this phenomenon. The salinity of porewater at a specific well was found to vary temporally along tidal cycle, from being highest at the start of high tide and lowest during a low tide period. Time series analysis of chemical characteristics of the samples depicts that tidal fluctuation on a diurnal-scale significantly affects the ionic composition of the discharged groundwater along with piezometric level for unconﬁned aquifer. Graphical geochemical plots suggest that ionic exchanges at GW-SW interaction zone along with redox cycles are likely to be the main processes responsible for water quality changes. These findings highlight the significant influence of tidal fluctuations and wave pumping on discharged groundwater quality and groundwater-seawater hydrodynamics in the coastal areas.",

            "abstract": "Marine Group (MG) I and MG II Archaea were first reported over two decades ago. While significant progress has been made on MG I, the progress on MG II has been noticeable slower. The common understanding is that while MG I mainly function as chemolithoautotrophs growing on ammonia and live predominantly in deeper water, MG II live heterotrophically and reside mostly in the photic zone. While some MG I lineages that could conduct ammonium oxidation are frequently found in terrestrial environments, MG II are exclusively found in marine environments and thus named Thalassoarchaea. A few studies showed MG IIs were sporadically blooming in coastal waters and may be influenced by the level of eutrophication between seasons, which inhibited the enrichment and cultivation for MGII. In this study, we quantified the abundance of planktonic MGI (represented by archaeal amoA gene) and MGII (16S rRNA gene) using qPCR in the water column of different salinities (A: 0.8‰; B: 18.1‰; C: 23.9‰: D: 31‰) in the Pearl River Estuary over a 12-month period. The results showed that the abundance of MGII in site C (8.5±10.1×107 copies/L) was significantly higher than the other three sites (A: 3.5±8.8×105 copies/L; B: 2.7±4.5×107 copies/L; D: 2.2±4.4×107 copies/L) in all seasons, indicating the perennial blooming of MGII that might be due to the optimal combination of available organic carbon and salinity at this site. We also observed that the correlation between MGI and MGII became better toward the marine water and was significant at site D (R2: A, 0.06; B, 0.1; C, 0.24; D, 0.64), indicating the potential functional relationship between them with increasing salinity. This allowed us to hypothesize that the growth of MGI in the coastal site is more dependent on release of ammonia from organic matter degradation by MGII and other heterotrophic organisms. The Pearl River estuary may be an ideal environment for testing this hypothesis, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carbon cycle performed by different archaea in continental margin systems.",

This study evaluates how different processes of large-scale circulation and removal control seasonal variations in Arctic black carbon (BC) using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric general circulation model (AM3). We find that transport and wet deposition play unequal roles in determining Arctic BC seasonal cycle. Despite seasonal differences in general circulation patterns, the eddy-driven BC transport changes little throughout the year, and the seasonal cycle of Arctic BC is attributed to wet removal. BC hydrophilic fraction affected by the aging process and hydrophilic BC (BCpi) wet deposition rate affected by cloud microphysics determine wet deposition. Both low hydrophilic fraction and low wet deposition rate account for the peak of BC in winter. The transition to low BC in summer results from an increase in wet deposition rate, while the return of BC in late autumn is mainly caused by a sharp decrease in hydrophilic fraction. The results suggest that the concentrations of Arctic aerosols as well as their climate impacts may be susceptible to modification in a future climate.",

            "abstract": "Immersion mode heterogeneous ice nucleation plays a crucial role in controlling the composition of mixed phase clouds, which contain both supercooled liquid water and ice particles. The amount of ice in mixed phase clouds can affect cloud particle size, lifetime and extent and so affects radiative properties and precipitation. Feldspar minerals are probably the most important minerals for ice nucleation in mixed phase clouds because they nucleate ice more efficiently than other components of atmospheric mineral dust (Atkinson et al. 2013). The feldspar class of minerals is complex, containing numerous chemical compositions, several crystal polymorphs and wide variations in microscopic structure. Here we present the results of a study into ice nucleation by a wide range of different feldspars. We found that, in general, alkali feldspars nucleate ice more efficiently than plagioclase feldspars. However, we also found that particular alkali feldspars nucleate ice relatively inefficiently, suggesting that chemical composition is not the only important factor that dictates the ice nucleation efficiency of feldspar minerals. Ice nucleation by feldspar is described well by the singular model and is probably site specific in nature. The alkali feldspars that do not nucleate ice efficiently possess relatively homogenous structure on the micrometre scale suggesting that the important sites for nucleation are related to surface topography. Ice nucleation active site densities for the majority of tested alkali feldspars are similar to those found by Atkinson et al (2013), meaning that the validity of global aerosol modelling conducted in that study is not affected. Additionally, we have found that ice nucleation by feldspars is strongly influenced, both positively and negatively, by the solute content of droplets. Most other nucleants we have tested are unaffected by solutes. This provides insight into the mechanism of ice nucleation by feldspars and could be of importance when modelling ice nucleation in mixed phase clouds.\nAtkinson, J. D., Murray, B. J., Woodhouse, M.

Although previous statistical studies have shown that ULF waves are primarily compressional near the equator and transverse with linear polarization at higher latitude, the underlying reason for this distribution of wave polarization has not been understood. In order to address this key question, we have developed a two-dimensional, finite element code that solves the full wave equations in global magnetospheric geometry. Using this code, we show that (1) efficient mode conversion from the fast compressional waves to the ion-ion hybrid resonance occurs at Mercury consistent with previous calculations; (2) such mode-converted waves globally oscillate similar to field-line resonance at Earth; and (3) compressional wave energy is primarily localized near the equator, while field-aligned transverse, linearly polarized waves generated by mode conversion at the ion-ion hybrid resonance radiate to higher latitude. Based on these wave solutions, we suggest that the strong transverse component of observed ULF waves at Mercury in high magnetic latitude can be explained as excitation of the field-line resonant waves at the ion-ion hybrid resonance.",

It has been observed by Rabiei et al. (2013) that moving cars can be a possible new source of data when used for measuring rainfall amount (RainCars). The optical sensors operating the windscreen wipers showed the potential of being used for rainfall measurement purposes. Their measurement accuracy has been quantified in laboratory experiments. The main objective of this study is to investigate the benefit of using RainCars for estimating areal rainfall when these errors are considered explicitly. To this end, radar rainfall is considered as the reference and the other sources of data, i.e. RainCars and pseudo stations, are extracted from radar data. The goal is to compare the areal rainfall estimation by RainCars with pseudo stations and reference data. The value of the additional data is not only assessed for areal rainfall estimation performance, but also using hydrological modeling. In fact, the reference data simulates the reference discharge. The other sources of data also simulate the discharge that is to be compared with the reference discharge. The results show, that the RainCars provide useful additional information for areal rainfall estimation and hydrological modelling also if their measurement uncertainty is quite high.\nRabiei, E., Haberlandt, U., Sester, M., Fitzner, D., 2013.

            "abstract": "Empirical analyses of suspended sediment and bedload transport gives estimates of sediment flux for western Oregon and northwestern California. The estimates of both bedload and suspended load are from regression models relating measured annual sediment yield to geologic, physiographic, and climatic properties of contributing basins. The best models include generalized geology and either slope or precipitation. The best-fit suspended-sediment model is based on basin geology, precipitation, and area of recent wildfire. It explains 65% of the variance for 68 suspended sediment measurement sites within the model area. Predicted suspended sediment yields range from no yield from the High Cascades geologic province to 200 tonnes/ km2-yr in the northern Oregon Coast Range and 1000 tonnes/km2-yr in recently burned areas of the northern Klamath terrain.\nBed-material yield is similarly estimated from a regression model based on 22 sites of measured bed-material transport, mostly from reservoir accumulation analyses but also from several bedload measurement programs. The resulting best-fit regression is based on basin slope and the presence/absence of the Klamath geologic terrane. For the Klamath terrane, bed-material yield is twice that of the other geologic provinces. This model explains more than 80% of the variance of the better-quality measurements. Predicted bed-material yields range up to 350 tonnes/ km2-yr in steep areas of the Klamath terrane.\nApplying these regressions to small individual watersheds (mean size; 66 km2 for bed-material; 3 km2 for suspended sediment) and cumulating totals down the hydrologic network (but also decreasing the bed-material flux by experimentally determined attrition rates) gives spatially explicit estimates of both bed-material and suspended sediment flux. This enables assessment of several management issues, including the effects of dams on bedload transport, instream gravel mining, habitat formation processes, and water-quality. The combined fluxes can also be compared to long-term rock uplift and cosmogenically determined landscape erosion rates.",

            "abstract": "In the central interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada, the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) (MPB) has severely affected the majority of pine species in the region, especially lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson). The loss of mature lodgepole pine stands, including those lost to salvage logging, has resulted in an increase in the number of juvenile pine stands in the interior of BC through planting and natural regrowth. With this change from mature forests to juvenile forests at such a large spatial scale, the water balance of impacted areas may be altered, although the magnitude of such change is uncertain. Previous studies of rainfall partitioning by lodgepole pine and lodgepole pine dominated canopies have focused on mature stands. Thus, rainfall, throughfall and stemflow were measured and canopy interception loss was derived during the growing season of 2010 in a juvenile lodgepole pine dominated stand located approximately 60 km NNW of Kamloops, BC at 51°12'49” N 120°23'43\" W, 1290 m above mean sea level. Scaling up from measurements for nine trees, throughfall, stemflow and canopy interception loss accounted for 87.7, 1.8 and 10.5 percent of the 252.9 mm of rain that fell over 38 events during the study period, respectively. The reformulated versions of the Gash and Liu analytical interception loss models estimated cumulative canopy interception loss at 24.7 and 24.6 mm, respectively, compared with the observed 26.5 mm; an underestimate of 1.8 and 1.9 mm or 6.8 and 7.2% of the observed value, respectively. Our results suggest that canopy interception loss is reduced in juvenile stands compared to their mature counterparts and that this reduction is due to the decreased storage capacity offered by these younger canopies. Evaporation during rainfall from juvenile canopies is still appreciable and may be a consequence of the increased proportion of the canopy exposed to wind during events.",

            "abstract": "The Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone (LOFZ) is a major ~1000 km long dextral shear zone of southern Chile, likely related to strain partitioning of Nazca Plate oblique convergence with South America (Figure 1a). To understand block rotation pattern along the LOFZ, we paleomagnetically sampled 55 sites (553 samples) between 38°S and 41°S. We gathered Oligocene to Pleistocene volcanics and Miocene granites at a maximum distance of 20 km from the LOFZ, and at both sides of it. Rotations with respect to South America, evaluated for 36 successful sites, show that crust around the LOFZ is fragmented in small blocks, ~1 to 10 km in size.\nWhile some blocks (at both fault edges) undergo very large 150°–170° rotations, others do not rotate, even adjacent to fault walls. We infer that rotations affected equidimensional blocks, while elongated crust slivers were translated subparallel to the LOFZ, without rotating. Rotation pattern across the LOFZ is markedly asymmetric (Figure 1b). East of the fault and adjacent to it, rotations are up to 150°–170° clockwise, and fade out ~10 km east of fault. These data support a quasi-continuous crust kinematics, characterized by small rigid blocks drag by the underlying ductile crust flow, and imply 120 km of total fault offset. Conversely, crust west of the LOFZ is cut by seismically active NW-SE sinistral antithetic faults, and yields counterclockwise rotations up to 170° at 8–10 km from LOFZ, besides the unrotated blocks. Further data from the Chile fore-arc are needed to understand block rotation kinematics and plate dynamics west of the LOFZ.\n",

            "abstract": "Oceanic anoxic event 2 (OAE2), which occurred at the Cenomanian/Turonian Boundary (CTB, ~93.9 Ma), is characterized by enhanced burial of organic matter in ocean basins that was accompanied by a pronounced positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in both marine and terrestrial realms, thus representing a major perturbation to global carbon cycle. Although OAE2 is increasingly recognized, its detailed evolution including initiation, maintenance, and termination remains poorly understood. To unravel the evolution of OAE2, we have carried out a high-resolution magnetic and carbon isotope investigation of an expanded Cenomanian-Turonian boundary section at Tingri in southern Tibet, China. The studied section consists of a hemipelagic succession that was accumulated on the northern margin of India plate in eastern Tethys. Close-spacing sampling every 10 to 20 cm was conducted on the 76 m thick section. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) data of the samples display cyclic variations and spectral analysis of the MS data reveals dominant sedimentary cycles with cycle wavelength ratios similar to those of short eccentricity and precession. Thus, sedimentary cycles representing short eccentricity were used to establish an orbital timescale for the studied section. High-resolution carbon isotope data show a brief negative excursion preceding a relatiely prolonged positive CIE. Also, the new high-resolution carbon isotope data show that each stage of the positive CIE is not monotonic but contains stepwise, short-lived shifts, suggesting that carbon isotope variations were highly dynamic during OAE2. With the new orbital timescale, the OAE2 interval in the Tibetan section is estimated to last for ~870 kyr, which is in striking similarity to the duration estimate of 847 to 885 kyr from the CTB stratotype section. Correlation of our new high-resolution data with other OAE2 records permits detailed examination of the evolution OAE2, especially for unravelling the complicated feedbacks among sedimentary, biotic, and geochemical processes during this geologically brief event.",

            "abstract": "River deltas have the potential to mitigate increased nutrient loading to coastal waters by acting as biofilters that reduce the impact of nutrient enrichment on downstream ecosystems. Hydraulic residence time (HRT) is known to be a major control on biogeochemical processes and deltaic floodplains are hypothesized to have relatively long HRTs. Hydrological connectivity and delta floodplain inundation induced by riverine forces, tides, and winds likely alter surface water flow patterns and HRTs. Since deltaic floodplains are important elements of delta networks and receive significant fluxes of water, sediment, and nutrients from distributary channels, biogeochemical transformations occurring within these zones could significantly reduce nutrient loading to coastal receiving waters. However, network-scale estimates of HRT in river deltas are lacking and little is known about the effects of tides, wind, and the riverine input on the HRT distribution. Subsequently, there lacks a benchmark for evaluating the impact of engineered river diversions on coastal nutrient ecology. In this study, we estimate the HRT of a coastal river delta by using hydrodynamic modeling supported by field data and relate the HRT to spatial and temporal patterns in nitrate levels measured at discrete stations inside a delta island at Wax Lake Delta. We highlight the control of the degree of hydrological connectivity between distributary channels and interdistributary islands on the network HRT distribution and address the roles of tides and wind on altering the shape of the distribution. We compare the observed nitrate concentrations to patterns of channel-floodplain hydrological connectivity and find this connectivity to play a significant role in the nutrient removal. Our results provide insight into the potential role of deltaic wetlands in reducing the nutrient loading to near-shore waters in response to large-scale river diversions.",

This presentation will delve into detailed comparisons between the long time base and low spatial resolution data and the new high resolution snapshot of Pluto from the flyby. Special emphasis will be placed on the albedo and near-infrared spectral evolution over time. We will compare the albedo maps from the late 1980's built on mutual event data and two epochs of HST observations against the New Horizons images, after correcting for viewing geometry. Also included will be a discussion of the evolutionary trends in the hemispherically averaged spectral properties from Lowell Observatory and IRTF data against the resolved compositional and spectral maps from New Horizons. The combination of these data sets now permits an unprecedented ability to constrain time-variability on the surface from apparent changes due to viewing geometry and surface inhomogeneities. These comparisons require a reconcilliation of surface scattering properties that are enabled by the firm determination of the size of Pluto.",

            "abstract": "One of the primary challenges faced by the ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity Mars rover is developing a regression model that can accurately predict the composition of the wide range of target types encountered (basalts, calcium sulfate, feldspar, oxides, etc.). The original calibration used 69 rock standards to train a partial least squares (PLS) model for each major element. By expanding the suite of calibration samples to >400 targets spanning a wider range of compositions, the accuracy of the model was improved, but some targets with “extreme” compositions (e.g. pure minerals) were still poorly predicted.\nWe have therefore developed a simple method, referred to as “submodel PLS”, to improve the performance of PLS across a wide range of target compositions. In addition to generating a “full” (0-100 wt.%) PLS model for the element of interest, we also generate several overlapping submodels (e.g. for SiO2, we generate “low” (0-50 wt.%), “mid” (30-70 wt.%), and “high” (60-100 wt.%) models). The submodels are generally more accurate than the “full” model for samples within their range because they are able to adjust for matrix effects that are specific to that range.\nTo predict the composition of an unknown target, we first predict the composition with the submodels and the “full” model. Then, based on the predicted composition from the “full” model, the appropriate submodel prediction can be used (e.g. if the full model predicts a low composition, use the “low” model result, which is likely to be more accurate). For samples with “full” predictions that occur in a region of overlap between submodels, the submodel predictions are “blended” using a simple linear weighted sum.\nThe submodel PLS method shows improvements in most of the major elements predicted by ChemCam and reduces the occurrence of negative predictions for low wt.% targets. Submodel PLS is currently being used in conjunction with ICA regression for the major element compositions of ChemCam data.",

The benchmark marine alkenone producer, Emiliania huxleyi CCMP2758 strain (the mutant of strain CCMP1742, NEPCC55a) was reported to make 35:2 alkenone when cultured at 15 °C (Prahl et al., 2006). Here we show, when this strain is cultured at lower temperatures (e.g., 4°C), CCMP2758 produces large amount of 35:3 alkenone with unusual double bond positions of ∆7,12,19. We determined the double bond positions of the C35:3 methyl ketonee based on GC-MS analysis of cyclobutylimine derivatives and dimethyl disulfide derivatives respectively, and provide the first temperature calibrations based on the unsaturation ratios of C35 alkenones. Previous studies have found 35:2 alkenone with three methylene interruption in the Black Sea sediment, but it is the first time that an alkenone with a mixed three and five methylene interruption is found. The discovery of short chain alkenones with unusual double bond positions may shed new light to alkenone biosynthesis.",

            "abstract": "Concurrent infrasound and seismic records of a jet airstrike in Iraq are presented. Media reports stated that US jets carried out a large airstrike on June 3, 2015, just after midnight local time, that targeted and destroyed an ISIS car bomb factory in Hawija, Iraq, just south of the city of Kirkuk, Iraq. The resulting explosion was felt within Kirkuk and at other locations as far as 34 km away from the Hawija factory. Seismic broadband stations located in northern Iraq, at a distance of about 160 km, show clear simultaneous signals of infrasound waves on the seismometers as well as on collocated infrasound equipment. From an analysis of the body waves, the Pg to Lg time difference is nearly ~20 sec, with a back azimuth of 250o to 260o, which is consistent with explosion location. The time difference between the Pg and infrasound signals is just over 7 minutes, consistent with sound speed in the atmosphere. No clear Rg wave was observed. As was demonstrated by Aleqabi, Wysession, and Ghalib [2015, BSSA, in press], broadband seismic recordings are able to identify and distinguish between several different kinds of MOUT (military operations in urban terrain) and even determine the magnitudes of ordinance used in certain blasts. The addition of collocated infrasound equipment provides additional constraints that can be used in the analysis of the size and form of the MOUT.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) plays important roles in atmospheric chemistry and short-term forcing of climate. Clear understanding of atmospheric CH4's budget of emissions and losses is required to aid sustainable development of Earth’s future environment. We used an atmospheric chemistry-transport model (JAMSTEC’s ACTM) for simulating atmospheric CH4. An inverse modeling system has been developed for estimating CH4 emissions (7 ensemble cases) from 53 land regions for 2002–2012 using measurements at 39 sites. Global net CH4 emissions varied between 505–509 and 524–545 Tg/yr during 2002–2004 and 2010–2012, respectively (ranges based on 6 inversion cases), with a step like increase in 2007 in agreement with atmospheric measurement. The inversion system did not account for interannual variations in radicals reacting with CH4 in atmosphere. Our results suggest that the recent update of EDGAR inventory (version 4.2FT2010) overestimated global total emissions by at least 25 Tg/yr in 2010. Increase in CH4 emission since 2004 originated in the tropical and southern hemisphere regions, with timing consistent with an increase of non-dairy cattle stocks by ~10% in 2012 from 1056 million heads in 2002, leading to ~10 Tg/yr increase in emissions from enteric fermentation. All 7 inversions robustly estimated the interannual variations in emissions, but poorly constrained the seasonal cycle amplitude or phase consistently for all regions due to sparse observational network. Forward simulation results using both the a priori and a posteriori emissions are compared with independent aircraft measurements for validation. By doing that we are able to reject the upper limit (545 Tg/yr) of global total emissions as 14 Tg/yr too high during 2008–2012, which allows us to further conclude that CH4 emission increase rate over the East Asia (China mainly) region was 7–8 Tg/yr between the 2002–2006 and 2008–2012 periods, contrary to 1–17 Tg/yr in the a priori emissions.",

However, microseismic locations could be biased if seismic anisotropy, which is ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks due to either layered bedding or fracturing, is unaccounted in velocity models. To quantitatively assess such biases, we have applied a nonlinear location method to synthetic traveltime data in seven models from isotropy to different levels of anisotropy cases, including vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) and horizontal transverse isotropy (HTI). Synthetic waveforms are recorded at two vertical receiver arrays in a three-layer velocity model using a pseudo-spectral method. Both P and S wave arrivals are used to locate three events assuming an effective isotropic velocity model. The average location error is 59 m for isotropic case, and is 156 m (158 m), 237 m (244 m), and 258 m (265 m) for 5%, 10% and 15% VTI (HTI) cases, respectively. These results suggest that even 5% seismic anisotropy, if not properly accounted, can cause significant biases in microseismic event locations. Therefore, our future work will solve seismic anisotropy jointly while locating microseismic events.",

We applied a pattern recognition approach using statistical features to forecast the occurrence of strong earthquakes after target events. A window based method detects clusters of seismicity in the analyzed catalogue and classifies them as “type A” if, given a main shock of magnitude M, the subsequent strongest earthquake in the cluster has magnitude ≥M-1, of type B otherwise.\nWe tested a set of A cluster precursors available in literature (Vorobieva et al., 1993, Vorobieva,1999) and, in addition, we proposed a set of original features to characterize clusters. In particular, we investigated the temporal evolution of the radiated energy, the spatio-temporal distribution of the immediate foreshocks, including a detailed analysis of the dimension and shape of the region of preparation of the strong earthquake, the spatio-temporal evolution of the aftershocks occurring within a few days and the probability to have a strong earthquake depending on the time elapsed after the mainshock. Furthermore, we examined the spatial distribution of the two types of clusters inside the Italian territory. In order to characterize the feature depending on the cluster type, we used decision trees as classifiers on single feature separately. The generalization capability of resulting trees was improved by a pruning based on leave-one-out method; the performances of the classification are tested by leave-one-out method too. The analysis was performed on different time-spans after the mainshock to simulate the increase of information available as time passes during the seismic clusters.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is a product of incomplete combustion emitted by aircraft engines. In the atmosphere, BC particles strongly absorb incoming solar radiation and influence cloud formation processes leading to highly uncertain, but likely net positive warming of the earth’s atmosphere. At cruise altitude, BC particle number emissions can influence the concentration of ice nuclei that can lead to contrail formation, with significant and highly uncertainty climate impacts. BC particles emitted by aircraft engines also degrade air quality in the vicinity of airports and globally. A significant contribution to the uncertainty in environmental impacts of aviation BC emissions is the uncertainty in emissions inventories. Previous work has shown that global aviation BC mass emissions are likely to have been underestimated by a factor of three. In this study, we present an updated global BC particle number inventory and evaluate parameters that contribute to uncertainty using global sensitivity analysis techniques. The method of calculating particle number from mass utilises a description of the mobility of fractal aggregates and uses the geometric mean diameter, geometric standard deviation, mass-mobility exponent, primary particle diameter and material density to relate the particle number concentration to the total mass concentration.

The gaps and challenges moving forward, however, have significant implications for local-level Framework adoption and implementation, which call for a bottom-up perspective. The objective of this contribution to Session PA010 is to consider the following question: where can science best “fit” within this framework? This approach raises two critical issues of importance for this panel: scale and governance. The first, scale, refers to where DRR science is best suited for successful application, while the second, governance, refers to the how of the implementation in regard to stakeholders and decision making, both public and private, at the appropriate scale. Based on previous collaborative work on DRR at the local level, the authors will discuss the challenges of the Framework guiding principles, priorities for action, and the role of stakeholders as they relate to the issues of scale and governance. In conclusion, this contribution will emphasize the importance of targeted science for DRR at the local level based on continued involvement by the authors with local level DRR science and decision making.",

            "abstract": "North China Craton (NCC) is one of the oldest cratons in the world. Since early Paleozoic, massive lithospheric thinning and destruction has occurred in the eastern part of the NCC, however, still with debates on its mechanisms. The thinning of lithosphere has caused many volcanic activities and crustal deformation in NCC, while seismic anisotropy is an effective tool to study crustal and upper mantle deformation in different scales. Surface wave studies can resolve depth-dependent radial and azimuthal anisotropy, which provide important constraints on depth-varying deformation patterns of crust and upper mantle. Here we use the dense array data (200 stations) in NCC and joint analysis of ambient noise and earthquake surface waves to reveal depth-dependent azimuthal anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle in NCC. In together with local and teleseismic shear wave splitting data, surface deformation field from GPS observations and large scale upper mantle flow patterns, we have better constraints on how crust and lithospheric mantle in NCC deform with respect to the thinning or destruction of the lithosphere due to regional scale mantle flow or delamination processes.",

Measurements were made throughout the entire growing season during 2012, 2013, and 2014. The mean daily uptake of CO2 emissions under flooded soil conditions was at 4.0 g m-2 day-1, four times greater during flood than post flood, while ET was measured during flood at 3.12 mm day-1 was two times greater than post flood.

It is now recognized that the petrogenesis of TTG series derives from an hydrous mafic system at high pressure. However, the source of the early TTGs (3.5-3.2 Ga) have not been preserved and its characteristics are still debated. In this study we use thermodynamical modelling coupled with two-phase flow to investigate the products of partial melting of high-MgO primary mafic crust. Our model setup is made of a 45-km thick hydrated mafic crust and is heated above the solidus from 50 to 200°C. To explore the effects of melt-rock interactions during melt transfer (via two-phase flow), the melt composition is modelled either in thermodynamic equilibrium with the rock or in thermodynamic disequilibrium. Our modelling results show that partial melting of hydrous high-MgO metabasalt crust can produce significant volumes of felsic melt. The average composition of these melts is SiO2-rich > 62%, Mg# = 40-50, Na2O ~6%, MgO = 0.5-1% which is consistent with the composition of TTGs. The residual rock after melt segregation is composed of olivine + garnet + pyroxene which is in agreement with Archaean eclogites found in mantle xenoliths of Archaean cratons. Moreover, the depleted residual rock is denser than the mantle and is likely to be recycled in the mantle. We show that the early felsic crust with a TTGs signature could have been formed by partial melting of high-MgO hydrated metabasaltic crust, and propose that plume-related activity and/or rapid burial due to high volcanic activity are likely geodynamic conditions to generate an early felsic crust.",

            "abstract": "One of the essential features of the cellular automata (CA) model is its high scalability: CA lattices can be theoretically run at gargantuan size to represent intricacies of complex phenomena. However, one barrier in the use of cellular automata for scientific simulations is the issue of scalability in terms of the number of cells, to either model phenomena at finer granularities or at larger scales. Some researchers have developed parallel CA algorithms using MapReduce to eke out efficiency, but MapReduce may not provide the ideal scheme to address messy parallelism in large CA when they require complex rule-sets and broker a lot of state exchange across large solution-space lattices. In this research, we take advantage of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model of distributed computation, via the Giraph open-source implementation, to implement large-scale cellular automata simulations. Additionally, this study also describes a scientifically interesting example, in which ice dynamics in Antarctic is simulated using a melting model. Short-term and medium-term ice sheet dynamics are driven by a variety of forces. We do not fully understand what they might be and how they interplay, and simulation is an important medium for building the science to guide us in finding answers.

            "abstract": "Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) have similar aims and mutual benefits, and there is a very strong rationale for adopting a more integrated approach to these issues rather than analysing each of them as distinct from the other. One of the gaps that have been noted in this context is the lack of evidence in systematic integration of CCA and DRR in Southern Africa. In this regard, this study builds on understanding CCA and DRR policies from the perspectives of vulnerable groups- women and smallholder farmers, and conducts institutional and policy analysis of CCA and DRR in southern Africa, with specific focus on Malawi and Zimbabwe. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were employed to collect data for this study in the two countries. The analysis is centred on the conceptualization of DRR in the context of recovery time and CCA on livelihood changes. Findings of the study show that drought is no longer viewed as a hazard as it is a perennial and chronic occurrence in selected climate hotspots, with heightened intensity in certain identified years. Households are able to quickly recover from slow onset hazards such as droughts and dry spells more than they are able to recover from sudden onset floods, implying more capacity towards CCA than DRR. Government programmes and policies are also focused more on CCA than on DRR efforts that appear not to be a priority. Findings point towards female vulnerability from perceptions and practice where males tend to dominate where they are set to benefit from external assistance. We need to strengthen government capacity in implementation of DRR programmes, which is currently limited and development initiatives must deliberately target building the resilience of women.",

            "abstract": "A 20% of the world’s population is living in watersheds that suffer from water shortage. This situation has complex causes associated with historical changes in watersheds. However, disentangling the role of key drivers of water availability like climate change or land use practices is challenging. Part of the difficulty resides in that historical analysis is basically a process of empirical reconstruction from available environmental records (e.g. sediment cores or long-term hydrologic time series). We developed a mathematical approach, based on information theory, for historical reconstructions in watersheds. We analyze spectral entropies calculated directly or indirectly for sediment cores or long-term hydrologic time series respectively. Spectral entropy measures changes in Shannon’s information of natural patterns (e.g. particle size distributions in lake bottoms or streamflow regimes) as they respond to different drivers. We illustrate the application of our approach with two case studies: a reconstruction of a time series of historical changes from a sediment core, and the detection of hydrologic alterations in watersheds associated to climate and forestry activities. In the first case we calculated spectral entropies from 700 sediment layers encompassing 1500 years of history in Loon Lake (Southern Oregon). In the second case, we calculated annual spectral entropies from daily discharge for the last 45 years in two experimental watersheds in the H. J. Andrews LTER site (Oregon Cascades). In Loon Lake our approach separated, without supervision, earthquakes from landslides and floods. It can also help to improve age models for sedimentary layers. At H. J. Andrews’s sites our approach was able to identify hydrological alterations following a complete clear cut in 1975. It is also helpful to identify potential long-term impacts of these forestry activities, enhanced by climate change. Our results suggest that spectral entropy is central for translating between historical structural changes in natural patterns, and their timing and relevance in watershed history. Therefore, a more robust reconstruction of watershed history and a better identification of drivers for pressing environmental issues, seems possible under the framework of Shannon’s information theory.",

            "abstract": "Soils are the major component of the terrestrial ecosystem and the largest organic carbon reservoir on Earth. However, it's a non-renewable natural resource and quite reactive to human disturbance and climate change. Even small modifications, of less than a percent, of the huge amount of carbon contained in soils may lead to sources or sinks of greenhouse gases that could be significant relative to those released by fossil fuel combustion. Consequently, soil carbon dynamic is an important source of uncertainties for future climate predictions. To tackle this difficulty, there is a growing need for global and specific information on the soils to better understand the mechanisms controlling soil carbon dynamic and better constraints the Earth system models. Several global information systems on soil parameters already exist but these products are not always consistent and lack of spatial details.\nThe aim of our work is to compare the soil organic carbon stock given by different products : The World Soil Information (ISRIC), the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) and better understand what are the main differences that may explain the inconstencies between the products.\nWe calculated global and regional soil carbon stocks with the three products at different depths and we observed that they may largely differ in particular in boreal regions. We also observed bigger differences in the stocks estimated for surface soils compare to deep soils. Differences in boreal regions may be due to high disparities in soil organic carbon concentration whereas differences in other regions may be more likely due to different bulk densities. Finally, we compared the three products with field data available within the International Soil Carbon Network and we observed that each products present important drawbacks in representing the spatial variability. The estimation of the global soil carbon stocks is still quite uncertain and improved geostatistical methods are urgently need to reduce the confidence interval of the most important organic carbon stock.",

Since VIIRS does not include on-board spatial calibrator such as Spectroradiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA) on the predecessor sensor called MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the on-orbit estimation of the spatial parameters needs to be measured independently. As a well-known radiometric target, the moon is utilized to estimate Band-to-Band (BBR) results as a part of spatial quality factors using the lifetime scheduled lunar collections. The reference band of the BBR is chosen to be the VIIRS band of Imaging band 1 (I1), because of its high signal-to-noise ratio, and high spatial sampling frequency compared to other moderate (M) bands. In this study, the conventional BBR calculation applied MODIS called weighted sum method is applied providing along-track and along-scan direction results. The BBR differences based on the reference band I1 results are very stable over the 3 years of VIIRS operation. The along-scan direction BBR results are mostly within ± 0.5 nominal Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) and the along-track direction BBR values are mostly between + 0.1 and -0.4 GSD.

Since 2010, the production of natural gas liquids and the amount of natural gas vented/flared has increased by factors of ~1.28 and 1.57, respectively (U.S. Energy and Information Administration), indicating an increasingly large potential source of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere. Emission of VOCs may affect local and regional air quality due to the potential to form tropospheric ozone and organic particles as well as from the release of toxic species such as benzene and toluene.\nThe 2015 Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNex) campaign studied emissions from oil and natural gas activities across the central United States in order to better understand their potential air quality and climate impacts. Here we present VOC measurements from 19 research flights aboard the NOAA WP-3D over 11 shale basins across 8 states. Non-methane hydrocarbons were measured using an improved whole air sampler (iWAS) with post-flight analysis via a custom-built gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The whole air samples are complimented by higher-time resolution measurements of methane (Picarro spectrometer), ethane (Aerodyne spectrometer), and VOCs (H3O+ chemical ionization mass spectrometer). Preliminary analysis show that the Permian Basin on the New Mexico/Texas border had the highest observed VOC mixing ratios for all basins studied. We will utilize VOC enhancement ratios to compare the composition of methane and VOC emissions for each basin and the associated reactivities of these gases with the hydroxyl radical, OH, as a proxy for potential ozone formation.",

Although space plasmas typically contain density turbulence with large ranges of length scale L and orientations in 3D, most theoretical and numerical studies have focused on 1D linear density profiles. Other profiles are likely to yield semi-quantitative differences, as found previously for instance by comparing LMC for linear versus parabolic profiles. In this study, we examine the effects of superposing density fluctuations with a range of L onto linear density gradients. Langmuir waves are often observed as wave packets and this can result from short scale, weak, density fluctuations. Such small scale density fluctuations affect the wave propagation characteristics and wavevectors. Moreover, combining a linear density profile with superposed density fluctuations yielded trapped modes and resonant variations in the conversion efficiency. In particular, increased efficiencies are found when integer numbers of Langmuir wavelengths fit within one or more cavities formed by the superposed turbulence).",

            "abstract": "It is generally thought that Earth’s mantle abundances of highly siderophile elements (HSE) were established by the addition of a chondritic late veneer to a mantle that was stripped of HSEs by core formation. A long-standing problem with this hypothesis is that the mantle’s suprachondritic Pd/Ir and Ru/Ir ratios cannot be reconciled with any known meteorite group.\nTo address this issue, we modelled the effect of metal-silicate segregation on abundances of the HSE and S in the Earth’s mantle by including these elements in a combined accretion/core-formation model. Because in our model only a small fraction of the mantle equilibrates with core-forming metal, the bulk mantle HSE abundances are too large by the end of accretion. Sulfur abundances also greatly exceed S-saturation levels at magma ocean crystallisation temperatures, leading to the formation of a global immiscible sulfide melt that segregated to the core, thus removing HSEs from the mantle [1].\nTo better constrain the role of sulfide segregation on the HSE budget of the mantle, we experimentally determined the sulfide-silicate partitioning of Pt, Pd, Ru and Ir under high P-T conditions. Results show that Pd and Ru are less chalcophile at pressures above ~20 GPa compared to Pt and Ir, as opposed to the metal-silicate system where Ru is more siderophile than Pt [2]. These results are included in our model, which now involves localized segregation of core-forming metal followed by widespread exsolution and segregation of immiscible sulfide liquids. Platinum and Ir are efficiently extracted from the mantle whereas significant concentrations of Ru and Pd remain. Late veneer addition occurs after sulfide segregation has ceased due to magma ocean solidification. This model reproduces perfectly the non-chondritic Ru/Ir and Pd/Ir ratios of the mantle, reflecting incomplete removal of Ru and Pd from the mantle with core-forming sulfide melts.\n[1] O’Neill (1991) GCA 55, 1159-1172.

            "abstract": "At times, high resolution sea surface roughness variations can provide stunning details of submesoscale upper ocean dynamics. As interpreted, transformations of short scale wind waves by horizontal current gradients are responsible for those spectacular observations. Here we present tow major advances towards the quantitative interpretation of those observations. First, we show that surface roughness variations mainly trace two particular characteristics of the current gradient tensor, the divergence and the strain in the wind direction. Local vorticity and shear in the wind direction should not affect short scale roughness distribution and would not be detectable. Second, we discuss the effect of the viewing direction using sets of quasi-simultaneous sun glitter images, taken from different satellites to provide different viewing configurations. We show that upwind and crosswind viewing observations can be markedly different. As further confirmed with idealized numerical simulations, this anisotropy well traces surface current strain area, while more isotropic contrasts likely trace areas dominated by surface divergence conditions. These findings suggest the potential to directly observe surface currents at submesoscale by using high resolution roughness observations at multiple azimuth viewing angles.",

            "abstract": "This study proposes the exact identification method of faulting events. Radiocarbon ages of typical black soil collected continuously from lower to upper part clarify the timing of faulting events. We sampled black soil at intervals of 3 – 20 cm in a 2.2 m long vertical without space from the excavated trench wall of the Atera Fault, central Japan. Sample preparation and radiocarbon dating were carried out in the JAEA-AMS-TONO of the Tono Geoscience Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Calendar years were obtained by calibrating 14C age using OxCal 4.2.3 with IntCal13 atmospheric curve.\nThe soil ages in a footwall along the fault varied from 9,500 to 2,000 years ago with depth. The volcanic ash analysis supported the dating results. The soil deposited at an approximately constant rate, 0.1 – 0.2 mm/year. However, there are partially anomalous ages in the footwall. The soil ages at the depth of about 2.0 – 1.7 and 0.4 – 0.2 m were about 7,500 and 2,000 years ago, respectively. The results showed that the soil of a few dozen of cm in thickness deposited in a short term. In addition, the soil ages at the depth of about 1.5 – 1.1 and 0.8 – 0.7 m were about 7,000 and 4,000 years ago, respectively. These ages were older than the just lower soil ages, about 6,000 and 3,500 years ago. These anomalies are probably caused by fault displacements, which means the collapse of a hanging wall with old soil and the forming of lower part at the footwall side. The anomalous ages may suggest that faulting events took place about 7,500, 6,000, 3,500, and 2,000 years ago. Therefore, radiocarbon ages of the continuous black soil along the active fault are effective for identification of the faulting events. In our future research, this method will be applied to the soil of other active fault trench walls to clarify the timing of faulting events.",

The change in stress may induce brittle failure on fractures, causing microseismic events. Focal mechanisms of induced microseismic events are useful for understanding stress evolution in the reservoir. An accurate estimation of microseismic focal mechanism depends on the accuracy of velocity models. In this work, we study the improvement on estimation of microseismic focal mechanisms using a high-resolution velocity model. We obtain the velocity model using a velocity inversion algorithm with a modified total-variation scheme rather than the commonly used Tikhonov regularization technique. We demonstrate with synthetic microseismic data that the velocity inversion method with a modified total-variation regularization scheme improves velocity inversion, and the improved velocity models enhance the accuracy of estimated focal mechanisms of microseismic events. We apply the new methodology to microseismic data acquired at a CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery) site at Aneth, Utah.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that icy environments on bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus may be important potential habitats in our solar system. Life in icy environments faces many challenges, including water limitation, temperature extremes, and nutrient limitation. Understanding how life has adapted to withstand these challenges on Earth may help understand potential life on other icy worlds, and understanding the interactions of such life with minerals may help shed light on the detection of possible mineral biosignatures.\nSnow environments, being particularly nutrient limited, may require specific adaptations by the microbiota living there. Previous observations have suggested that associated minerals and microorganisms play an important role in snow algae micronutrient acquisition. Here, in order to interpret micronutrient uptake by snow algae, and potential formation of mineral biosignatures, we present observations of interactions between snow algae and associated microorganisms and minerals in both natural, Mars-analog environments, and laboratory experiments.\nSamples of snow, dust, snow algae, and microorganisms were collected from Mount Anderson Ridge, CA. Some samples were DAPI-stained and analyzed by epifluorescent microscopy, and others were freeze-dried and examined by scanning electron microscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Xenic cultures of the snow alga Chloromonas brevispina were also grown under Fe-limiting conditions with and without the Fe-containing mineral nontronite to determine impacts of the mineral on algal growth.\nObservations from epifluorescent microscopy show bacteria closely associated with the snow algae, consistent with a potential role in micronutrient acquisition. Particles are also present on the algal cell walls, and synchrotron-XRD and XRF observations indicate that they are Fe-rich, and may therefore be a micronutrient source. Laboratory experiments indicated enhanced algal growth in the presence of nontronite, as well as a close physical association between the snow alga and mineral surfaces. We are presently examining the role of minerals and microorganisms in nutrient acquisition, and attempting to identify mineral biosignatures.",

            "abstract": "Arguably the major difficulty faced to model the atmospheric behavior of objects entering the atmosphere is that we know very little about the internal structure of these objects and their methods of fragmentation during fall. In a study of over a thousand meteorite fragments (mostly hand-sized, some 40 or 50 cm across) in the collections of the Natural History Museums in Vienna and London, we identified six kinds of fracturing behavior. (1) Chondrites usually showed random fractures with no particular sensitivity to meteorite texture. (2) Coarse irons fractured along kamacite grain boundaries, while (3) fine irons fragmented randomly, c.f. chondrites. (4) Fine irons with large crystal boundaries (e.g. Arispe) fragmented along the crystal boundaries. (5) A few chondrites, three in the present study, have a distinct and strong network of fractures making a brickwork or chicken-wire structure. The Chelyabinsk meteorite has the chicken-wire structure of fractures, which explains the very large number of centimeter-sized fragments that showered the Earth. Finally, (6) previous work on Sutter’s Mill showed that water-rich meteorites fracture around clasts. To scale the meteorite fractures to the fragmentation behavior of near-Earth asteroids, it has been suggested that the fracturing behavior follows a statistical prediction made in the 1930s, the Weibull distribution, where fractures are assumed to be randomly distributed through the target and the likelihood of encountering a fracture increases with distance. This results in a relationship: σl = σs(ns/nl)α, where σs and σl refers to stress in the small and large object and ns and nl refer to the number of cracks per unit volume of the small and large object. The value for α, the Weibull coefficient, is unclear. Ames meteorite laboratory is working to measure the density and length of fractures observed in these six types of fracture to determine values for the Weibull coefficient for each type of object.",

            "abstract": "Nucleation and growth of new minerals in response to disequilibrium is the most fundamental metamorphic process. However, our current understanding of metamorphic reactions is largely based on inference from mineral assemblages brought to the surface by uplift and erosion, rather than from direct observation. The experimental investigation of metamorphism has also been limited, typically to concealed vessels thus restricting the possibility of direct microstructural monitoring. Recent advances in synchrotron-based X-ray micro-tomography allow for new experiments that utilise X-ray transparent setups in order to image these processes on the micron-scale in 4D. We conducted in-situ constant temperature experiments at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, USA) to dehydrate confined cylinders of Volterra Gypsum (5mm length x 2mm diameter). The relatively modest temperature of reaction and the apparently simple mineralogy make gypsum an ideal material for investigating processes associated with metamorphic devolatilization. Using a purpose-built X-ray transparent experimental cell (Fusseis et al., 2014, J. Synchrotron Rad. 21, 251-253) to apply an effective pressure of 5MPa, the samples were heated to 388K for approximately 10 hours to acquire three-dimensional time-series tomography datasets comprising forty time steps. Images show grains of the product material (bassanite) growing throughout the sample accompanied by an evolving porous network. These datasets provide new visual insights into the spatiotemporal association between porosity development and the formation of product minerals during devolatilization. The direct observation of reaction also has important implications for general metamorphic theory as we can track the complete history of grain growth from nucleation through to interaction with surrounding grains.",

Nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) from C4-C8 and oxygenated VOCs, including alcohols, aldehydes and ketones were quantified multiple times per hour, day and night during the campaign using in-situ fast gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (fast-GC/MS). Samples were also collected in canisters two to three times daily and subsequently analyzed for C2-C8 NMHCs. The NMHCs and aldehydes all showed decreasing mixing ratios with time during the experiment whereas acetone and MEK showed increases. These results are interpreted in the context of a box model and a 3D chemical transport model. After adjusting for seasonal trends in the VOCs, acetone, MEK and 2-pentanone were all negatively correlated with O3, while NMHCs, methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, propanal and butanal were all positively correlated with O3. Several ozone depletion events (ODEs) during the study provided an opportunity to investigate the large perturbations due to halogen chemistry on the production and loss of VOCs in the air masses at the sampling site. Notably, aldehyde mixing ratios dropped below the detection limit of the instrument (< 3 pptv) during the ODEs. The NCAR Master Mechanism (MM) (0-D box model), which was updated to include halogen chemistry, was able to reproduce the bromine explosion and showed consistency with key observations including the aldehyde data. Further, no clear positive or negative air-snow flux could be identified for any of the VOCs observed by fast-GC/MS during the study.",

A 3336.8 nm interband cascade laser probes a fundamental infrared absorption band for sensitivity to ethane under ambient conditions, as enabled by employing wavelength modulation spectroscopy. Simultaneous measurement of methane on an adjacent line corrects for cross-sensitivity with ethane in the air-broadened second harmonic spectrum. The sensor has an average power consumption of 20 W with an optical pathlength of 60 m and has been mounted alongside CO2 and CH4 analyzers on our mobile laboratory. With a noise equivalent absorbance of 2 x 10-5, precision and sensitivity are expected to be better than 1 ppbv, comparable to background levels away from localized ethane sources. Results are presented using the sensor for identification of fugitive methane leakage from natural gas production in the Marcellus Shale, helping to exclude other potentially collocated sources including wetlands and small-scale animal feeding operations. Ethane is applied as a highly effective tracer for distinguishing biologically produced methane from the thermogenic methane of interest. For medium- to high- emitting wells, we also obtain information about natural gas composition. Finally, performance of the instrument for measuring ethane and methane under varying regimes (enhancement over ambient atmospheric levels, methane/ethane ratios) is discussed along with future applications enabled by the reduced power and weight specifications and 10 Hz time response.",

Marine organisms are just one type of organism affected by environmental changes; by studying how changes in the environment in the past have affected evolution, we can make predictions for the future. Drastic environmental changes have occurred since the beginning of the Cambrian (541 Ma), as have changes in the ecologies of different phyla and marine organisms as a whole. Organisms must adapt to changing environments, and by analyzing the correlations between the two variables, we can find out which environmental factors play roles in the prevalences of characteristics in populations. Distinctive patterns in the originations and extinctions of ecologies in large fractions of a population and the changes in environmental conditions are visible through careful analysis. We have found, through correlation tests between factors, that statistically significant correlations (p-values < 5%) do exist between certain ecologies (including motility, feeding habits, and tiering) and environmental factors. In particular, these include changes in sea level and carbon dioxide levels, two of the biggest effects of global warming that is currently occurring.

            "abstract": "Since olivine is usually the first major phase to crystallize from basaltic magma, its primary chemistry is a sensitive tracer of the early evolution of volcanic systems. However, fast diffusion and homogenization under magmatic conditions frequently modifies the original composition of olivine, which hampers the reconstruction of cooling histories and magma evolution from the chemistry and zoning patterns of phenocrysts in erupted products. Phosphorous is a notable exception due to its sluggish diffusion in olivine crystals and silicate melts, as igneous olivines almost always display complex zoning patterns. Phosphorus zoning in olivine has been linked either to crystallization rate variations and diffusion controlled growth or to strong compositional controls on melt-mineral partitioning. We illuminate the versatility of P-in-olivine with a comprehensive EPMA and LA-ICPMS dataset on olivines from Italian potassium rich mafic lavas and the primitive melt inclusions (MI) that they host. The olivines are characterized by P concentrations from limit of quantification (22 ppm) to 435 ppm P with MIs containing up to 2.2 wt.% P2O5. High resolution (1-2 µm per pixel) element maps show both fine oscillatory and large scale sector zoning in P, which is uncorrelated with zoning in any other element. The MIs are virtually always surrounded by P-depleted zones that are also depleted in Cr and enriched in Al and Ti, which we attribute to a combination of supply-limited slow growth and melt compositional controls on partitioning behavior imposed by the boundary layer. We demonstrate that P zoning carries valuable information on the nature and timing of magmatic events such as mingling/mixing, wall-rock assimilation and subsequent re-equilibration processes. P-in-olivine is most promising to distinguish multiple generations of MIs, as a guide to study their mode of entrapment and to disclose the origin of primary heterogeneities.",

            "abstract": "The consumption of marine fish, especially predatory species high in the food chain, is the major route through which people in developed countries are exposed to mercury. Recent work on a coastal species, bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), determined that the mercury concentration in fish from the U. S. Mid-Atlantic coast decreased 43% from 1972 to 2011. This mercury decline in a coastal marine fish parallels the mercury decline in many freshwater fish in the U.S. and Canada during the same time period. The result heightens interest in determining whether or not there has been any change in mercury concentration in oceanic predatory fish species, that is, fish that are permanent residents of the open ocean, during the past four decades. To answer this question we compared mercury analyses we made in the 1970s on tournament-caught blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) with those we made from 1998 to 2013. This comparison indicates that from the 1970s to 2013 mercury concentration in blue marlin caught in the western North Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. east coast has declined about 45%, a decline that is remarkably similar to the decline reported in coastal bluefish.

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic (EMIC) waves are known to be excited by the cyclotron instability associated with hot and anisotropic ion distributions in the equatorial region of the magnetosphere. One of the significant scientific issues concerning EMIC waves is to understand how these waves are detected at the ground. In order to solve this puzzle, it is necessary to understand the propagation characteristics of the field-aligned EMIC waves, which include polarization reversal, cutoff, resonance, and mode coupling between different wave modes, in dipolar magnetic field. However, the inability of ray-tracing to adequately describe wave propagation near the crossover cutoff-resonance frequencies in multi-ion plasma is a one of the reasons why the scientific questions remain unsolved. Using a recently developed 2D full-wave code that solves the full wave equations in global magnetospheric geometry, we demonstrate how EMIC waves propagate to higher magnetic latitude in an electron-proton-He+ plasma. We find that polarization reversal occurs at the crossover frequency from left-hand (LH) to right-hand (RH) polarization and the RH EMIC waves can either propagate to the inner magnetosphere or reflect to the outer magnetosphere at the Buchsbaum resonance location. We also clearly found mode-coupling from guided LH EMIC waves to unguided RH or LH waves (i.e., fast mode) occurs at the crossover location, which is consistent with previous 1D full-wave analysis.",

We suggest that these are ions created far from the comet, picked up by the solar wind and carried back toward the comet. Their high energy suggests that these are ions resulting from a combination of photo-ionization and photo-dissociation of the neutral water molecules from the nucleus (i.e. O+, OH+, H2O+, and possibly H3O+). Such high energy pickup ions were seen during the Giotto flyby of comet Halley. The IES data also show ~keV level ions from the direction of the comet, that we postulate are anti-sunward ions (solar wind and/or pickup ions) that have been reflected from the comet nucleus and moving back in the solar direction. We will present results of analysis of the IES measurements supporting these conclusions.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of buoyancy-driven hydrocarbon plumes with the stably stratified deep-ocean environment plays a crucial role in the formation of underwater oil intrusions. As gas bubbles and oil droplets are released from an underwater oil well blowout, they induce a strong buoyancy flux that lifts entrained sea water to form an upward plume. Towards higher elevations, the stratification-induced negative buoyancy increases and eventually exceeds the gas/oil-induced buoyancy, causing the plume to decelerate and a large fraction of entrained sea water to peel off from the rising plume to form a fountain-like downward outer plume. During this peeling process, weakly buoyant particles (e.g. small oil droplets) are trapped and fall together with the detrained fluid, and then migrate horizontally at the equilibrium buoyancy depth, forming underwater oil intrusion layers. In this study, the complex plume dynamics and oil intrusion are studied using a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. The LES model captures the essential characteristics of the plume structure and the peeling/intrusion processes, and yields good agreement with prior laboratory experiments. Applying to the Deepwater Horizon oil well blowout condition, the LES model shows considerable underwater trapping and intrusion of oil droplets under various conditions, with the trapping rate significantly affected by the diameter of the oil droplet.

            "abstract": "Reservoir simulators are widely used to constrain uncertainty in the petrophysical properties of subsurface formations by matching the history of injection and production data. However, such measurements may be insufficient to uniquely characterize a reservoir’s properties. Monitoring of natural (isotopic) and introduced tracers is a developing technology to further interrogate the subsurface for applications such as enhanced oil recovery from conventional and unconventional resources, and CO2 sequestration. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been piloting this tracer technology during and following CO2 injection at the Cranfield, Mississippi, CO2 sequestration test site. Two campaigns of multiple perfluorocarbon tracers were injected together with CO2 and monitored at two wells at 68 m and 112 m from the injection site. The tracer data suggest that multiple CO2 flow paths developed towards the monitoring wells, indicative of either channeling through high permeability pathways or of fingering. The results demonstrate that tracers provide an important complement to transient pressure data. Numerical modeling is essential to further explain and interpret the observations.\nTo aid the development of tracer technology, we enhanced a compositional multiphase reservoir simulator to account for tracer transport. Our research simulator uses higher-order finite element (FE) methods that can capture the small-scale onset of fingering on the coarse grids required for field-scale modeling, and allows for unstructured grids and anisotropic heterogeneous permeability fields. Mass transfer between fluid phases and phase behavior are modeled with rigorous equation-of-state based phase-split calculations. We present our tracer simulator and preliminary results related to the Cranfield experiments. Applications to noble gas tracers in unconventional resources are presented by Darrah et al.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, a lot of efforts were made in order to measure and model the polarization of the auroral red line emission (λ 630nm). This polarization arises due to impact of thermospheric oxygen atoms with precipitating electrons collimated along the geomagnetic field but is diluted by many competing production mechanisms that do not produce polarization, and other loss mechanisms as well. Observations show that the red line emission is polarized at a level of a few percent.\nIn order to continue investigating this field, we are building a spectropolarimeter able to measure the polarization of the full auroral spectrum between 400 and 700 nm. In particular the blue emission band due to N2+ 1NG (λ 428nm) is a very interesting candidate for polarization as it is produced by impact with precipitating electrons only.\nA test campaign with a first version of the spectropolarimeter was carried out in Skibotn, Norway, in December 2014 aiming at validating the experimental concept and estimating the integration times needed to obtain adequate S/N ratios. In the coming months, we will work on improving the design and make some twilight sky observations in Brussels as a calibration test. This presentation will review the principle of the instrument, the observations carried out in Skibotn as well as the recent work and tests made on the instrument.",

This project critically examines the state of natural hazard information available for Missoula, Montana. It exposes weaknesses and strengths of current hazard assessment and develops methods for improving both existing data and how hazard information is presented for stakeholder use. This is done through expert critique from scientists who specialize in hazard-related fields and through stakeholder interviews. Initial findings show that some hazards are more poorly constrained than others. Earthquake data are sparse in this region and uncertainty is great. Significant work is needed to improve the underlying datasets and the methods by which the information is distributed. We propose creating user-friendly natural hazard information through a web-based medium along with expanding the data available for assessing seismic hazard near Missoula, MT using GPS measurements.

            "abstract": "Abstract: Positive charge is found in newly formed water vapor. Two detection and two measurement experiments are presented. The detection experiments are simple; their purpose is only to show the existence of charge in water vapor. The first of these experiments places one exposed end of an insulated wire in the vapor space of a flask, which holds boiling water. The other end of this wire is connected to the input high of an electrometer. The input low, in all of the presented experiments, is grounded. The second experiment detects charge by capacitive induction. It uses a beaker with gold leaves gilded on its outside surface. When water boils inside the beaker, the vapor charge is detected by the gold layer without contacting the water or vapor.\nThe two measurement experiments have sensors made of conducting fabric. The fabric is used to cover the opening of a flask, which holds boiling water, to collect the charge in the escaping vapor. These two experiments differ by the number of fabric layers --- four in one and six in the other. The results obtained from these two experiments are essentially the same, within the margin of error, 0.734 & 0.733 nC per gram of vapor. Since the added two layers of the six-layer sensor do not collect more charge than the four-layer sensor, the four-layer sensor must have collected all available charge. The escaping vapor exits into a chamber, which has only a small area opening connecting to the atmosphere. This chamber prevents direct contact between the sensor and the ambient air, which is necessary because air is found to affect the readings from the sensor. Readings taken in the surrounding area in all four experiments show no accumulation of negative charge.\nThese experiments identify a source for the atmospheric electricity in a laboratory environment other than that has been discussed in the literature. However, they also raise the question about the missing negative charge that would be predicted by charge balance or the Law of Charge Conservation. The question of positive charge in vapor with no corresponding negative charge is a phenomenon that deserves attention and will be addressed in future articles.",

The primary goal of this effort is to measure the CO2 wettability of rock samples from the Mt. Simon Sandstone, and to determine how this wettability is affected by the different mineral components comprising the samples. Contact angle measurements of CO2 in brine on pure minerals present in the Mt. Simon sandstone, and on the Mt. Simon sandstone itself, will be presented. The effects of surface roughness and surface charge of the samples on contact angle will also be presented.

In addition, unlike standard Fourier-transform spectroscopy, it has an almost ideal instrument lineshape function and does not require recalibration.

This initial demonstration used laboratory-based lasers and achieved a sensitivity of 2.3 ppbv for CH4, 1 ppmv for CO2, and <1 ppmv for H2O and HDO with 5 minute measurement times. We are currently developing a portable system that will cover a wider spectral region (about 1.3-2.1 µm or 7700-4750 cm-1) with improved sensitivity.

The southern San Andreas fault itself has also evolved since this time, with several shifts in activity among fault strands within San Gorgonio Pass. We use three-dimensional mechanical Boundary Element Method models to investigate the impact of these changes to the fault network on deformation patterns. A series of snapshot models of the succession of active fault geometries explore the role of fault interaction and tectonic loading in abandonment of the West Salton detachment fault, initiation of the San Jacinto fault, and shifts in activity of the San Andreas fault. Interpreted changes to uplift patterns are well matched by model results. These results support the idea that growth of the San Jacinto fault led to increased uplift rates in the San Gabriel Mountains and decreased uplift rates in the San Bernardino Mountains. Comparison of model results for vertical axis rotation to data from paleomagnetic studies reveals a good match to local rotation patterns in the Mecca Hills and Borrego Badlands. We explore the mechanical efficiency at each step in the evolution, and find an overall trend toward increased efficiency through time. Strain energy density patterns are used to identify regions of off-fault deformation and potential incipient faulting. These patterns support the notion of north-to-south propagation of the San Jacinto fault during its initiation. The results of the present-day model are compared with microseismicity focal mechanisms to provide additional insight into the patterns of off-fault deformation within the southern San Andreas fault system.",

The primary purpose of the CARE II mission is to validate the dress-particle theory of enhanced incoherent scatter from a dusty plasma and to validate models of plasma instabilities driven by high-speed charged particles. The CARE II chemical payload produces 66 kg of micron-sized dust particles composed of aluminium oxide. In addition to the dust, simple molecular combustion products such as N2, H2, CO2, CO, H20 and NO will be injected into the bottomside of the F-layer. Charging of the dust and ion charge exchange with the molecules yields plasma particles moving at hypersonic velocities. Streaming instabilities and shear electric fields causes plasma turbulence that can be detected using ground radars and in situ plasma instruments. The instrument payload was separated from the chemical release payload soon after launch to measure electric field vectors, electron and ion densities, and integrated electron densities from the rocket to the ground. The chemical release of high speed dust was directed upward on the downleg of the rocket trajectory to intersect the F-Layer. The instrument section was about 600 meters from the dust injection module at the release time. Ground HF and UHF radars were operated to detected scatter and refraction by the modified ionosphere. Optical instruments from airborne and ground observatories were used to map the dispersal of the dust using scattered sunlight. The plasma interactions are being simulated with both fluid and particle-in-cell (PIC) codes.

            "abstract": "Measuring the heat emission from active volcanic features on the basis of infrared satellite images contributes to the volcano's hazard assessment. Because these thermal anomalies only occupy a small fraction (< 1 %) of a typically resolved target pixel (e.g. from Landsat 7, MODIS) the accurate determination of the hotspot's size and temperature is however problematic. Conventionally this is overcome by comparing observations in at least two separate infrared spectral wavebands (Dual-Band method). We investigate the resolution limits of this thermal un-mixing technique by means of a uniquely designed indoor analog experiment. Therein the volcanic feature is simulated by an electrical heating alloy of 0.5 mm diameter installed on a plywood panel of high emissivity. Two thermographic cameras (VarioCam high resolution and ImageIR 8300 by Infratec) record images of the artificial heat source in wavebands comparable to those available from satellite data. These range from the short-wave infrared (1.4–3 µm) over the mid-wave infrared (3–8 µm) to the thermal infrared (8–15 µm). In the conducted experiment the pixel fraction of the hotspot was successively reduced by increasing the camera-to-target distance from 3 m to 35 m. On the basis of an individual target pixel the expected decrease of the hotspot pixel area with distance at a relatively constant wire temperature of around 600 °C was confirmed. The deviation of the hotspot's pixel fraction yielded by the Dual-Band method from the theoretically calculated one was found to be within 20 % up until a target distance of 25 m. This means that a reliable estimation of the hotspot size is only possible if the hotspot is larger than about 3 % of the pixel area, a resolution boundary most remotely sensed volcanic hotspots fall below. Future efforts will focus on the investigation of a resolution limit for the hotspot's temperature by varying the alloy's amperage. Moreover, the un-mixing results for more realistic multi-component target pixel consisting of more than two thermally distinct features should be analyzed.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades the importance of brines for ore-formation has been demonstrated for a wide range of deposit types and geological settings. Chloride can reach high concentrations in fluids of diverse origins and it complexes many metals in solution. Nevertheless, there are elements which are preferentially complexed by other ligands and are transported and concentrated in low-Cl fluids. Magmatic fluids normally have Cl as the dominant cation and may be very saline. Transition metal levels in magmatic brines from arc settings in particular are often very high, reflecting strong chloride complexing and associated mineralization is often dominated by metals such as Fe which reach high concentrations in brines. Not all magmatic hydrothermal fluids are brines however, and where Cl is less abundant the composition of the dissolved load can be very different. Because of “salting out” effects, highly saline fluids are relatively low in dissolved gases, whereas low salinity fluids can carry significant loads of CO2, H2S and other volatile species, including B, As, Sb and Hg. Of the volatile species with the potential to complex specific metals only H2S has been investigated in any detail. Arsenic is particularly abundant in some low-salinity fluids, however the possible role of As-complexing in transport of Au or other metals is not known. There is little evidence for enhancement of metal solubility by CO2 under upper crustal conditions, except through lowering of pH, but there is some evidence that CO2-saturated brines may mobilize Ni more effectively than brines alone. Sulfate is an important anion in a range of magmatic and hydrothermal fluids and may be primary or arise from oxidation of magmatic H2S in geothermal systems. Notably, sulfate preferentially forms aqueous complexes with the HREE, and may play a role in HREE-enrichment. Fluids in which Cl does not dominate the dissolved load have potential to cause enrichment in a diverse range of elements, but this is most likely to be realised in systems where Ca is relatively low, since it would otherwise remove many of the ligands of interest from solution.",

            "abstract": "Glacial erosion is a fundamental link between climate and the tectonic and surface processes that create topography. Mountain ranges worldwide have undergone large-scale modification due the erosive action of ice masses, yet the mechanisms that control the timing of this modification and the rate by which ice erodes remain poorly understood. Available data report a wide range of erosion rates from individual ice masses over varying timescales, from the modern to orogenic. Recent numerical modeling efforts have focused on replicating the processes that produce the geomorphic signatures of glacial landscapes. Central to these models is a simple index that relates erosion rate to ice dynamics.\n To provide a quantitative test of the links between glacial erosion, sliding and ice discharge, we examined explicitly the factors controlling modern glacier erosion rates across climatic regimes, from Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula. We find that modern, basin-averaged erosion rates vary by three orders of magnitude, from 1->10 mm yr-1 in Patagonia to 0.01-<0.1 mm yr-1  in the AP, largely as a function of temperature and basal thermal regime. Erosion rates also increase non-linearly with both the sliding speed and the ice flux through the ELA, in accord with theories of glacial erosion. Notably, erosion rates decrease by over two orders of magnitude between temperate and polar glaciers with similar discharge rates. The difference in erosion rates between temperate and colder glaciers of similar shape and size is primarily related to the abundance of meltwater accessing the bed. Since all glaciers worldwide have experienced colder than current climatic conditions, the 100-fold decrease in long-term relative to modern erosion rates may in part reflect the temporal averaging of temperate and polar conditions over the lifecycle of these glaciers. Hence, climatic variation, more than the extent of ice cover or tectonic changes, controls the pace at which glaciers shape mountains.",

            "abstract": "In order to distinguish the thermal and compositional heterogeneities in the mantle, it is crucial to resolve the lateral variations not only in seismic velocities but also in intrinsic attenuation. Indeed, the high sensitivity of intrinsic attenuation to temperature and water content, governed by a form of Arrhenius equation, contrasts with the quasi-linear dependence of velocities on both temperature and major element composition. The major challenge in imaging attenuation lies in separating its effects on seismic waves from the elastic ones. The latter originate from the wave propagation in media with strong lateral elastic gradients causing (de)focusing and scattering. We have previously developed a 3D upper-mantle shear attenuation model based on time domain waveform inversion of long period (T > 60s) fundamental and overtone surface wave data (Gung & Romanowicz, 2004). However, at that time, resolution was limited to very long wavelength structure, because elastic models were still rather smooth, and the effects of focusing could only be estimated approximately, using asymptotic normal mode perturbation theory.With recent progress in constraining global mantle shear velocity from waveform tomography based on the Spectral Element Method (e.g. SEMUCB_WM1, French & Romanowicz, 2014), we are now in a position to develop an improved global 3D model of shear attenuation in the upper mantle. In doing so, we use a similar time domain waveform inversion approach, but (1) start with a higher resolution elastic model with better constraints on lateral elastic gradients and (2) jointly invert, in an iterative fashion, for shear attenuation and elastic parameters. Here, we present the results of synthetic tests that confirm our inversion strategy, as well as preliminary results towards the construction of the next generation upper-mantle anelastic model.",

            "abstract": "The spatial distribution of channel steepness, erosion rate, and physiographic data highlight pronounced along-strike changes in active strain accumulation in the northwest Himalaya. In particular, the data suggest that the mid-crustal ramp of the Main Himalayan Thrust could merge along-strike with an active portion of the Main Boundary Thrust near longitude ~77º E. This along-strike change in active fault geometry also coincides with the lateral termination of both lesser and greater Himalayan sequences, a significant reduction in total shortening within the wedge, and pronounced variations in regional seismicity. Recent activity along extensional structures in the high Himalaya of this same region appears to have led to significant reorganization, modification and capture of the Sutlej River basin, one of the largest Himalayan river systems. Given the recent 2015 Gorkha earthquake along a comparable section ~500-km along strike, these new constraints on active fault architecture could have regional implications for how strain is partitioned along seismogenic faults in the northwest Himalaya.

            "abstract": "Convective entrainment is known to impact the modelling of the mean climate, and in particular the pattern of mean tropical precipitation. Increasing convective entrainment suppresses convection in the margins of convergence zones and increases precipitation in the center of these convergence zones. This results from an interaction between convection and large-scale circulation. Results from the CNRM-CM5 model suggest that this sensitivity of the mean actually results from the synoptic variability: the larger the entrainment, the more intense the synoptic precipitating events, with drier periods between events. The changes in intensity and frequency of these events combine to explain the different sensitivities in the centers and margins of the convergence zones. In turn, it appears that the intensity of the synoptic precipitating disturbances is related to the mean stratification, as mesured by the Gross Moist Stability (GMS). The larger the entrainment, the smaller the GMS, because of a larger humidity stratification and a smaller potential temperature stratification, and the larger the dynamic feedback on precipitating disturbances. For large entrainment, the tropical mean GMS is even negative, implying a strong positive feedback of circulation onto precipitating disturbances.",

            "abstract": "We present lipid biomarker data of a sedimentary record that spans the entire Holocene and was recovered from a marine inlet located at the northern coast of South Georgia (Cumberland West Bay) to adress two major objectives, namely: a) the identification of temporal variations in reservoir effects and b) the reconstruction of regional environmental changes during the last deglaciation. For objective a) we compare compound-specific radiocarbon ages of terrigeneous lipid biomarkers (n-alcohols) with 14C ages of bulk sedimentary organic matter to detect potential reservoir effects and changes over time. The study site experienced different environmental conditions following the retreat of the local glaciers in the early Holocene. After an initial freshwater stage when the inlet was separated from the sea, it passed into brackish and finally fully marine conditions. These hydrological changes probably resulted in variable reservoir ages. For objective b) we investigate biomarkers, comprising n-alkanes (C15-C35) and n-alcohols (C14-C28), including high molecular weight compounds typically derived from land plants and low molecular weight compounds like C17 n-alkanes and C16 n-alcohols, mostly originating from aquatic organisms. We noticed an abrupt increase in TOC values and sums of biomarkers after the glacier retreat, culminating in highest concentrations at the transition from freshwater to brackish conditions. Subsequently, the concentrations decline and vary at low levels until the inlet becomes fully marine. The marine stage is characterized by relatively constant TOC values but variable biomarker concentrations. Lowest biomarker levels occur around 1870±134 cal yr BP and between 6204±115 and 9666±161 cal yr BP and correspond to phases of glacier advance as suggested by studies of lake and peat deposits from South Georgia.",

            "abstract": "Turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) produces fluctuations in the static pressure. The instantaneous pressure at a point depends on an integral over the entire flow; therefore, the effects from turbulence far aloft may be felt at the earth's surface. The statistics of fluctuating pressure at the surface have been studied extensively in the context of wall-bounded engineering-type flows. At best, these neutral flows are a special case of the thermally-stratified ABL, but relatively few experimental studies have considered pressure at the ground under various stability conditions. Here the scaling of pressure statistics at the surface, particularly the spectral density, is reported over a range of convective and stable conditions for both inner and outer turbulence parameters. Measurements of turbulent surface pressure were made using low-frequency microphones buried flush to the ground in a field near Laramie, Wyoming. Simultaneous measurements from three near-surface sonic anemometers and a 50-meter wind tower give estimates of the mean surface-layer parameters. The normalization of the pressure spectrum with the inner scales collapses the spectra along the high-frequency viscous power-law band. The wall shear stress, Obukhov length, L, and horizontal integral scale, λ, are identified as outer scaling parameters for the surface pressure spectrum from an integral solution employing a Monin-Obukhov-similar profile and a simple model of inhomogeneous surface-layer turbulence. Normalization with the outer scales collapses the spectra at low frequencies. Spectral scaling also reveals trends with λ/L in the low-frequency region for both convective and stable boundary layers.",

            "abstract": "Since 2004, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), together with the CIRS and UVIS spectrometers, aboard the Cassini spacecraft has provided insight on Saturn and Titan atmospheres through remote sensing observations. The presence of clouds and aerosols in Titan's dense atmosphere makes the analysis of the surface radiation a difficult task. For this purpose, an atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) model is required. The implementation of a RT code, which includes multiple scattering, in an inversion algorithm based on the Bayesian approach, can provide strong constraints about both the surface albedo and the atmospheric composition.\nThe application of this retrieval procedure we have developed to VIMS-IR spectra acquired in nadir or slant geometries allows us to retrieve the equivalent opacity of Titan's atmosphere in terms of variable aerosols and gaseous content. Thus, the separation of the atmospheric and surface contributions in the observed spectrum is possible. The atmospheric removal procedure was tested on the spectral range 1-2.2μm of publicly available VIMS data covering the Ontario Lacus and Ligeia Mare regions.\nThe retrieval of the accurate composition of Titan's atmosphere is a much more complex task. So far, the information about the vertical structure of the atmosphere by limb spectra was mostly derived under conditions where the scattering could be neglected [1,2]. Indeed, since the very high aerosol load in the middle-low atmosphere produces strong scattering effects on the measured spectra, the analysis requires a RT modeling taking into account multiple scattering in a spherical-shell geometry. Therefore the use of an innovative method we are developing based on the Monte-Carlo approach, can provide important information about the vertical distribution of the aerosols and the gases composing Titan's atmosphere.\n[1]Bellucci et al., (2009).

            "abstract": "Sediment removal rates from buoyant river discharges are typically scaled with particle settling velocity. However, some field and laboratory data suggest that removal can take place at rates higher than those predicted by individual particle settling. It is possible that these enhanced removal rates could potentially be due, at least in part, to mass settling of fluid and sediment near the fresh and saltwater interface. Fluid shear at the interface can mix the freshwater and sediment with the underlying saltwater and lead to pockets or bands of saltwater and sediment that are more dense than the underlying clear saltwater; resulting in an unstable configuration that can lead to rapid vertical transport of sediment. In this study, we perform laboratory experiments to study the enhancement of sediment removal from buoyant plumes under the effect of shear-driven gravitational instabilities. To do this, we ran a 5 cm deep layer of freshwater with flocculated kaolinite over a 50 cm deep basin of clear saltwater in a 1 m long glass flume under a range of upper layer velocities, concentrations, and initial stratification ratios. A Vectrino profiler is placed such that it constantly records velocity profiles from 2 cm above to 2 cm below the original interface. The velocity of the buoyant layer is controlled using a vertical head pipe at the flume inlet, and the Richardson number is varied from 0.05 to 0.25. The interface is monitored with a digital camera and a laser sheet, and Rhodamine B is added to the buoyant layer for better visualization. Snapshots from the video are used to observe the overall dynamics and developments of instabilities at the interface. The sediment concentration of the inflow and outflow of the system are continuously measured with a pair of OBS sensors, and floc size is measured with a floc imaging system and converted to a floc settling velocity. The difference in sediment concentration between the two OBS sensors is used along with a mass conservation box model to back calculate an effective settling velocity between the two sensors. This data is then used to test the hypothesis that the shear-driven effective settling velocities are higher than individual particle settling velocities and that greater removal rates are observed at lower Richardson numbers.",

            "abstract": "The Nejapa-Miraflores (NM) and Granada (G) lineaments which cut across the Central American volcanic front (CAVF) host numerous monogenetic vents which have erupted diverse basaltic magmas (e.g., Walker, 1984). As previously shown by Walker (1984), the basaltic magmas loosely fall into two groups: a high Ti, low K group which are reminiscent of MORB or BABB; and a low Ti, high K group which are more typical of subduction zones worldwide. Major element data obtained from over 200 olivine-hosted melt inclusions found within NM and G tephras from six separate monogenetic vents confirm this unusual compositional dichotomy. Melt inclusions from four of the six monogenetic vents are exclusively high- or low-Ti, while two of the volcanoes have both high- and low-Ti melt inclusions.\nNew volatile and trace element data on over 40 of the NM and G melt inclusions has yielded additional compositional distinctions between the high- and low-Ti groups. Least degassed high-Ti melts tend to have lower water contents than their low-Ti counterparts. The high-Ti Inclusions also have lower concentrations of U, Th, Pb, Ba and Cs and lower La/Yb ratios. In addition, there are subtle HFSE variations between the two types of basalts.\nThe overall geochemical differences between the high- and low-Ti groups suggest that the mantle wedge source of the latter contains a greater slab-derived (hemipelagic) sediment melt component than the former linked to a larger flux of hydrous fluids from deeper in the subducting Cocos plate. What is particularly significant is that the contrasting mafic emanations from these monogenetic volcano lineaments demonstrate that transport of fluids, volatiles and basaltic melts in subduction zones can be quite variable and complex on a very localized scale.",

            "abstract": "On March 11th, 2011 the occurrence of the Tohoku-oki Earthquake (Mw 9.0) considerably changed the observed crustal deformation pattern in Central -Eastern Japan, providing the opportunity to study the mechanical properties in the area, since elastic and inelastic mediums would have different response to the coseismic instantaneous displacement as well as transient postseismic displacement. In the near field of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, it is difficult to extract a pure deformation response since direct effects from the postseismic deformation source are mixed. In order to focus on the response at the far field, we analyzed postseismic crustal deformation in Central Japan. Before the quake, we observe general East-West contraction with localize deformation in the eastern margin of the Japan Sea, known as the Niigata Kobe Tectonic Zone (NKTZ) (Sagiya, 2000), whereas the coseismic response, which corresponds to the instantaneous elastic strain release, do not indicate highly concentrated strain feature, as expected if the deformation could be explain only by an elastic behavior. This implies that the interseismic and coseismic strains are not balanced and there is significant amount of contribution of inelastic processes. In the Earth’s crust, inelastic processes are expected to take a form of aseismic faulting, and should be distinguished from elastic behavior by its spatial wavelength. Also, the inelastic behavior can be persistent before and after the quake since the coseismic stress change in the far field is considered to be too small to change the regional stress that drives the inelastic process. Thus we review temporal variation of crustal deformation pattern in Central Japan based on daily coordinates of 837 GPS sites from GEONET, before and after the Tohoku-oki earthquake in order to distinguish elastic and inelastic behavior within the NKTZ. We found that the deformation in the area can be explained as a combination of two processes: an elastic general pattern, in response to the plate boundary activity, and a source of inelastic deformation such as aseismic faulting driven by the regional stress field.",

            "abstract": "The Early to mid-Miocene (23 to 14 million years ago) is a compelling interval to study Antarctic ice sheet sensitivity to changes in atmospheric CO2 as oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns in the southern hemisphere were broadly similar to present and reconstructed atmospheric CO2 concentrations were analogous to those projected for the next several decades. This time interval includes the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO), a period of global warmth during which average surface temperatures were 3 to 4°C higher than today. Miocene sediments in the AND-2A drill core from the Western Ross Sea, Antarctica provide direct information regarding ice sheet variability through this key time interval and offer insight into the potential Antarctic contribution to future sea level rise. A multi-proxy dataset derived from AND-2A identifies four distinct environmental “motifs” based on changes in sedimentary facies, fossil assemblages, geochemistry, and paleotemperature. Four major disconformities in the drill core coincide with regional seismic discontinuities and reflect transient expansion of marine-based ice across the Ross Sea. They all correlate with major positive shifts in benthic oxygen isotope records and episodes of sea-level fall, and generally coincide with intervals when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were below current levels (~400 ppm). Five intervals reflect ice sheet minima and air temperatures warm enough for significant ice mass loss during episodes of high (>400 ppm) atmospheric CO2. These results suggest that polar climate and the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) were highly sensitive to relatively small changes in CO2 during the early to mid-Miocene, which is supported by numerical ice sheet and climate modelling.",

Mellors, and Evan Hirakawa.\nWe have analyzed effects of wave scattering due to near-source structural complexity and sliding joint motion on generation of shear waves from SPE-4Pprime, a shallow chemical explosion conducted at the Nevada National Security Site. In addition to analyzing far-field ground motion recorded on three-component geophones, we performed high-frequency simulations of the explosion using a finite difference method and heterogeneous media with stochastic variability. The stochastic variations of seismic velocity were modeled using Gaussian correlation functions. Using simulations and recorded waveforms we demonstrate the implication of wave scattering on generation of shear motion, and show the gradual increase of shear motion energy as the waves propagate through media with variable scattering. The amplitude and duration of shear waves resulting from wave scattering are found to be dependent on the model complexity and to a lesser extent to source distance. Analysis of shear-motion generation due to joint motion were conducted using numerical simulations performed with GEODYN-L, a parallelized Lagrangian hydrocode, while a stochastic approach was used in depicting the properties of joints. Separated effects of source and wave scattering on shear motion generation will be shown through simulated motion.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344\nRelease Number: LLNL-ABS-675570",

            "abstract": "The budget non-closure is commonly found in GRACE-based water budget (GRACE-WB) and usually explained as measurement errors. Since GRACE has a unique ability to detect the change of water storage both due to natural and anthropogenic factors, the non-closure needs to be investigated from not only measurement errors but also anthropogenic effects. The Hai River Basin (HRB) is selected as the study area to explore the relationship between the GRACE-WB non-closure and human modifications to water, including groundwater consumption and water diversion, with a considering of the outstanding feature of GRACE. The in situ measured precipitaion (P) and net runoff (R), together with evapotranspiration (E) from GLDAS land surface models (LSMs), are used to calculate the budget error between terrestrial water storage change (ΔTWS) derived from GRACE and P-E-R. It is found that the budget errors are comparable to bulletin reported water consumption and human modifications to water (groundwater use + water diversion), at annual and inter-annual scale, respectively. It is concluded that the GRACE-WB non-closure in HRB is dominated by the difference between LSM-simulated and GRACE-monitored water storage change resulted from anthropogenic use of water, which is usually not included in most LSMs but still seen by GRACE.",

            "abstract": "Physical mechanisms of tidal inlet accretion are difficult to document because of the episodic nature of sediment delivery to the coast from fluvial sources and the complex patterns of current magnitudes and directions arising from the interaction of nearshore waves with ebb-tidal delta bathymetry. Using monthly RTK-GPS field measurements of beach topography adjacent to a natural inlet, we document a shoreline change time series that illustrates a bi-directional, alongshore spreading pattern of accretion following an exceptionally high rainfall-discharge event in May 2009. Numerical modeling of wave set-up and nearshore currents in the vicinity of the inlet and ebb tidal delta produces depth-averaged flow velocity patterns consistent with our field observations of coastal accretion. Our results are in agreement with an accretion mechanism, proposed by other researchers, that involves sediment delivery to the margins of the ebb tidal delta during high velocity ebb flows that accompany large rainfall-discharge events, followed by onshore migration of swash bars during subsequent days to months, at a rate dependent upon the timing of nearshore wave energy delivery to the site.",

            "abstract": "In February 2011, several ground fissures up to ~1.8 km in length appeared in the Quetta Valley, Balochsitan, Pakistan. It is not clear what caused the sudden occurrence of these fissures. The region is tectonically active and bounded to the west by several regional strike-slip faults including the north-south striking left-lateral Chaman fault system that slips at ~10 mm per year. Several large earthquakes have occurred recently in this area, one fatal 6.4 magnitude (Mw) earthquake occurred on October 28th, 2008. Some parts of Quetta Valley are subsiding; GPS data from two stations in Quetta that span mid-2006 – 2009 recorded subsidence rates of ~10 cm per year. Although subsidence in urban areas is generally attributed to groundwater depletion, it is not clear whether ground fissures are caused by water withdrawal or related to tectonics of the region. This study is designed to quantify and assess the source of surface deformation in Quetta Valley using InSAR, GPS, seismic and earthquake centroid moment tensor data. To detect and map the spatial-temporal features of the processes that led to the surface deformation, we used two time series, i.e., 15 European Remote Sensing (ERS-1/2) satellite images from 1992 – 1999 and 27 ENVISAT images spanning 2003 – 2010. A Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique was used to investigate surface deformation. Eleven continuous-GPS stations within the InSAR antenna footprint were compared with the InSAR time series for quality control. Preliminary InSAR results revealed that the areas in and around the fissures are subsiding at 5 cm per year. Five seismic lines totaling ~60 km, acquired in 2003, were used to interpret faults beneath Holocene alluvium in the Quetta Valley. One of the blind faults is a north-south striking thrust fault mapped north into the Takatu range. However, a focal mechanism for the 2008 earthquake in this region indicated northwest-southeast strike-slip fault movement.",

            "abstract": "Currently the moduli and velocities of rocks at seismic frequencies are usually measured by the strain-stress method in lab. However, such measurements require well-designed equipment and skilled technicians, which greatly hinders the experimental investigation on the elastic and visco-elastic properties of rocks at seismic frequencies. We attempt to model the dynamic moduli of porous rocks saturated with viscous fluid at seismic frequencies on core scale using the strain-stress method, aiming to provide a complement to real core measurements in lab. First, we build 2D geometrical models containing the pore structure information of porous rocks based on the digital images (such as thin section, SEM, CT, etc.) of real rocks. Then we assume the rock frames are linearly elastic, and use the standard Maxwell spring-dash pot model to describe the visco-elastic properties of pore fluids. Boundary conditions are set according to the strain-stress method; and the displacement field is calculated using the finite element method (FEM). We numerically test the effects of fluid viscosity, frequency, and pore structure on the visco-elastic properties based on the calculation results. In our modeling, the viscosity of the pore fluid ranges from 103mPas to 109mPas; and the frequency varies from 5Hz to 500Hz. The preliminary results indicate that the saturated rock behaves stiffer and shows larger phase lag between stress and strain when the viscosity of the pore fluid and (or) the frequency increase.",

On a polar orbit, PACE will make climate-quality global measurements that are essential for understanding ocean biology, biogeochemistry, ecology, aerosol and cloud properties. These measurements will be used to help determine how the ocean and atmosphere are influencing and being influenced by a changing climate. At the heart of the PACE mission is a broad spectrum moderate resolution (~1 km nadir) radiometer, called the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI). OCI will provide high spectral resolution (5 nm) from the UV to NIR (350 – 800 nm), with additional spectral bands in the NIR and SWIR to support atmospheric correction, and aerosol and cloud science. Never before has a U.S. space borne instrument measured across such a broad spectral range at such a fine spectral and spatial resolutions on a global scale. The added capability of OCI presents unique new opportunities for oceanic and atmospheric retrievals, but also new challenges, especially for atmospheric correction. These challenges are being met in a variety of creative ways. In addition to OCI, PACE may include a multi-spectral, multi-angle polarimeter that will enhance aerosol and cloud characterization, aid significantly in atmospheric correction for oceanic retrievals, and may offer new insight into characterization of oceanic hydrosols. With these advanced global remote sensing capabilities PACE is expected to: (1) Provide high quality observations for both basic science research, as well as applications; and (2) Extend the current time-series of climate quality data to enable detection of long-term trends.",

            "abstract": "Evidence that frequency of flash flood is increasing at the global scale has strengthened considerably in recent years. Our study provides insight into how changes in maximum precipitation and large-scale atmospheric circulations modulated the modes of regional scale short- and long-term flood magnitudes during last several decades (i.e.1920-2015) in North and South Carolina. The non-stationary univariate/bivariate extreme value analysis (EVA) models were fit to the short-term (5-day and 11-day) and long-term (monthly, seasonal and annual) maximum flows by incorporating linear/non-linear combination of covariates like maximum precipitation and large scale atmospheric circulations (the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)). Eleven of 13 piedmont and the coastal plain gauges show upward trends in short-term (5-day and 11-day) flood magnitudes with changes in the location (mean), scale (standard deviation) and shape (skewness) parameters of the probability distribution. In addition, the trend and nonstationarity in annual flood magnitudes of mountain gauges are monotonically positive potentially leading to increased rainfall induced annual floods. Incorporating large scale covariates in the functionality of the EVA procedure indicated a lagged positive relationship between fall to early winter ENSO and PDO with winter (Jan- Mar) flood magnitudes and frequency. Many study gauges show evidence for step increases in flood frequency around 1940 and 1980 for long- and short-term periods of major catchments in the Carolinas. Our study further used copulas to model the bivariate dependence between ENSO and flood anomaly and the trivariate dependence between ENSO, PDO, and flood anomaly. Both the bivariate and trivariate copulas resulted with almost the same interquartile ranges and simultaneously predicted flood magnitude and frequency. Our results indicated that the greatest monotonic trends occurred in both short-and long-duration floods through a strong nonstationary relationship with maximum precipitation and large-scale circulation modes, potentially leading to an increase in the magnitudes and frequency of the diurnal to annual patterns of flash-floods in the Carolinas.",

            "abstract": "For an accurate simulation of the atmospheric state in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) biosphere – atmosphere interactions are of particular importance. Measurements indicate distinct regional scale spatio-temporal patterns in the atmospheric CO2 distribution. The aim of our study is to understand which processes and environmental conditions (e.g. atmospheric transport, land use, orography) generate these patterns and how the variable CO2 concentrations influence the stomatal control of transpiration and photosynthesis. For that, we use the regional scale terrestrial model system TerrSysMP-CO2 that couples the atmospheric model COSMO (developed from the German Meteorological Service) to the Community Land Model (CLM). TerrSysMP-CO2 includes a two-way coupling of CO2, i.e. the actual CO2 mixing ratio is used to calculate the biogenic CO2 fluxes (photosynthesis, autotrophic/heterotrophic respiration) with CLM and, in turn, these fluxes prognostically change the atmospheric CO2 content. High-resolution anthropogenic emissions complete the CO2 budget in TerrSysMP-CO2.\nWe will present final results simulated with TerrSysMP-CO2 over a model domain including a low mountain range and the densely populated Rhine valley in the western part of Germany. Our results show a distinct diurnal cycle of CO2 in the PBL with the highest values occurring in the early morning caused by near surface CO2 accumulation due to soil respiration. With the onset of photosynthesis a strong decrease of atmospheric CO2 is simulated as well as the turbulent vertical transport within the PBL. Downstream of densely populated regions significant higher CO2 concentrations can be seen. Moreover, a strong horizontal heterogeneity arises between narrow valleys and mountain ridges caused by mountain-valley circulations. Compared with model simulations without CO2 dynamics we see changes in the simulated temperature and moisture distribution in the PBL. These can be attributed to the response of simulated leaf stomatal resistances on the variable CO2 which leads to modified transpiration fluxes. A comprehensive comparison with eddy-covariance flux measurements as well as with vertical CO2 profiles measured at a 120 m tower show a good consistency of our model simulations.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s outer core is a rotating ellipsoidal shell of compressible, stratified and self-gravitating fluid. The Galerkin method is applied to study the effects of density stratification on the frequencies of the inertial modes for a compressible shell proportional to the realistic Earth’s fluid core. The inertial modes of the core are the free oscillations with periods longer than half of a day and have the Coriolis force as their restoring force. Historically an incompressible and homogeneous fluid sphere is considered to study these modes and analytical solutions are known for the frequencies and the displacement eigenfunctions of this model. The three potential description (3PD) is used to a compressible and stratified fluid core model with different stratification parameters β, related to the local Brunt-Väisälä frequency. As a first approximation, however, we ignore the ellipticity of the core’s figure. The 3PD scheme describes the exact linearized dynamics of rotating, self-gravitating, stratified, compressible and inviscid fluids. We show that, depending on the size of β, some modal frequencies and eigenfunctions are practically unaffected by stratification, some are changed and some modes may disappear. We also first derive the web of characteristics, which gives more information about the eigenfunctions of these modes, as functions of frequency and stratification for compressible and inviscid fluids.",

The PR-HPA network encompasses 27,750 ha of research sites with data going back to the early 1900s. A partial list of on-going research projects include those encompassing long-term manuring and continuous corn (Est. 1912), dryland tillage plots (Est. 1970), soil nutrients and tillage (Est. 1983), biofuel feedstock studies (Est. 2001), and carbon sequestration study (Est. 2000). Affiliated partners include the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) that develops measures to improve preparedness and adaptation to climate variability and drought; the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) that coordinates data acquisition from over 170 automated weather stations and around 50 automated soil moisture network across NE and beyond; the AMERIFLUX and NEBFLUX networks that coordinate the water vapor and carbon dioxide flux measurements across NE with emphasis on rainfed and irrigated crop lands; the ARS Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network (GRACEnet) and the Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices (REAP) project; and the Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies (CALMIT) that assists with the use of geospatial technologies for agriculture and natural resource applications. Current emphases are on addressing present-day and emerging issues related to profitability and sustainability of agroecosystems. The poster will highlight some of the ongoing and planned efforts in research pertaining to climate variability and change, water sustainability, and ecological and agronomic challenges associated with corn, soybeans, managed grasslands, bioenergy and beef production needed by society, while securing a high quality of life in rural and urban communities, as well as maintaining or improving ecosystem services including productivity, biodiversity, air, water, and soils.",

            "abstract": "The Sangre de Cristo and Nacimiento uplifts of the southern Rocky Mountains formed key parts of a major Paleogene topographic boundary separating the Cordilleran orogenic system from the North American plate interior. This barrier largely isolated interior Laramide basins from a broad Laramide foreland with fluvial systems draining to the Gulf of Mexico, and thereby played a critical role in the evolution of continental-scale paleodrainage patterns. New detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and heavy mineral provenance analyses of Cretaceous-Paleogene siliciclastic strata in the Raton, Galisteo-El Rito, and San Juan basins record the partitioning of the broad Cordilleran (Sevier) foreland basin by Laramide basement uplifts. These trends are recognized both in provenance signals and depositional styles corresponding to cratonward (eastward) propagation of the Laramide deformation front and resultant advance of flexural depocenters in the North American interior. Along the eastern flank of the deformation front, the Raton basin shows a mix of Cordilleran, Appalachian, and Grenville age zircons restricted to the Cretaceous Dakota and Vermejo formations, marine units of the Western Interior Seaway. Upsection, the Cordilleran age peaks are absent from Paleocene-Eocene units, consistent with significant Laramide drainage reorganization and isolation from Cordilleran sources to the west. In the Galisteo-El Rito basin system, a shift to dominantly Mazatzal-Yavapai basement ages is recognized in the Paleocene El Rito and Oligocene Ritito formations. The heavy mineral results show a corresponding shift to less mature, dominantly metamorphic source compositions. These new datasets bear upon Cretaceous-Cenozoic reconstructions of North American paleodrainage and have implications for potential linkages between major fluvial systems of the southern Rocky Mountains and Paleogene deepwater reservoir units in the Gulf of Mexico basin.",

            "abstract": "Although life on Earth first emerged as prokaryotic organisms, it eventually evolved into billions of different species. However, extinctions on Earth, especially the five mass extinctions, have decimated species. So what leads to a species survival or demise during a mass extinction? Are certain species more susceptible to extinctions based on their size and ecology? For this project, we focused on the data of marine animals. To examine the impact of size and ecology on a species’s likelihood of survival, we compared the sizes and ecologies of the survivors and victims of the five mass extinctions. The ecology, or life mode, of a genus consists of the combination of tiering, motility, and feeding mechanism. Tiering refers to the animal’s typical location in the water column and sediments, motility refers to its ability to move, and feeding mechanism describes the way the organism eats; together, they describe the animal’s behavior. We analyzed the effect of ecology on survival using logistic regression, which compares life mode to the success or failure of a genus during each mass extinction interval. For organism size, we found the extinct organisms’ mean size (both volume and length) and compared it with the average size of survivors on a graph.\nOur results show that while surviving genera of mass extinctions tended to be slightly larger than those that went extinct, there was no significant difference. Even though the Permian (Changhsingian) and Triassic (Rhaetian) extinctions had larger surviving species, likewise the difference was small. Ecology had a more obvious impact on the likelihood of survival; fast-moving, predatory pelagic organisms were the most likely to go extinct, while sedentary, infaunal suspension feeders had the greatest chances of survival.\nOverall, ecology played a greater role than size in determining the survival of a species. With this information, we can use ecology to predict which species would survive future extinctions.",

            "abstract": "Water in the mantle influences melting, metasomatism, viscosity and electrical conductivity. The Alligator Lake mantle xenolith suite is one of three bimodal peridotite suites from the northern Canadian Cordillera brought to the surface by alkali basalts, i.e., it consists of chemically distinct lherzolites and harzburgites [1-2]. The lherzolites have equilibration temperatures about 50 °C lower than the harzburgites and are thought to represent the fertile upper mantle of the region. The harzburgites might have come from slightly deeper in the mantle and/or be the result of a melting event above an asthenospheric upwelling detected as a seismic anomaly at 400-500 km depth [3]. Major and trace element data are best interpreted as the lherzolite mantle having simultaneously experienced 20-25% partial melting and a metasomatic event to create the harzburgites [3]. Well-characterized xenoliths are being analyzed for water by FTIR. Harzburgites contain 29-52 ppm H2O in orthopyroxene (opx) and ~140 ppm H2O in clinopyroxene (cpx). The lherzolites have H2O contents of 27-150 ppm in opx and 46-361 ppm in cpx. Despite correlating with enrichments in LREE, the water contents of the harzburgite pyroxenes are low relative to those of typical peridotite xenoliths [4], suggesting that the metasomatic agents were water-poor, contrarily to what has been suggested before [3]. The water content of cpx is about double that of opx indicating equilibrium. Olivine water contents are low (< 5 ppm H2O) and out of equilibrium with those of opx and cpx, which may be due to H loss during xenolith ascent. This is consistent with olivines containing more water in their cores than their rims. Olivines exclusively exhibit water bands in the 3400-3000 cm-1 range, which may be indicative of a reduced environment [5].\n[1] Francis. 1987 JP 28, 569-97. [2] Eiche et al. 1987 CMP 95, 191-201.

            "abstract": "Peridotite xenoliths from the Rio Grande Rift (RGR) are being analyzed for H2O contents by FTIR as well as for major and trace element compositions. Nine samples are from the Rio Puerco Volcanic Field (RP) which overlaps the central RGR and southeastern Colorado Plateau; seventeen samples are from Kilbourne Hole (KH) in the southern RGR. Spinel Cr# (Cr/(Cr+Al) = 0.08-0.46) and olivine Mg# (Mg/(Mg+Fe) = 0.883-0.911) of samples fall within the olivine-spinel mantle array from [1], an indicator that these are residues of partial melting. Pyroxene H2O contents in KH correlate with bulk rock and pyroxene Al2O3 contents. The KH clinopyroxene rare earth element (REE) variations fit models of 0-13% fractional melting of a primitive upper mantle. Most KH peridotites have bulk-rock light REE depleted patterns, but five are enriched in light REEs consistent with metasomatism. Variation in H2O content seems unrelated to REE enrichment. Metasomatism is seen in RP pyroxenite xenoliths [2] and will be examined in the peridotites studied here. Olivine H2O contents are low (≤20 ppm), and decrease from core to rim within grains. This is likely due to H loss during xenolith transport by the host magma [3]. Diffusion models of H suggest that mantle H2O contents are still preserved in cores of KH olivine, but not those of RP olivine. The average H2O content of Colorado Plateau clinopyroxene (670 ppm) [4] is ~300 ppm higher than RGR clinopyroxene (350 ppm). This upholds the hypothesis that hydration-induced lithospheric melting occurred during flat-slab subduction of the Farallon plate [5]. Numerical models indicate hydration via slab fluids is possible beneath the plateau, ~600 km from the paleo-trench, but less likely ~850 km away beneath the rift [6].\n[1]Arai, 1994 CG 113, 191-204.[2]Porreca et al., 2006 Geosp 2, 333-351.[3]Peslier and Luhr, 2006 EPSL 242, 302-319.[4]Li et al., 2008 JGR 113, 1978-2012.[5]Humphreys et al., 2003 Int Geol Rev 45, 575-595.[6]English et al., 2003 EPSL 214, 619-632.",

Portable hyperspectral cameras had opened up new horizons for mineralogical characterization at different scales: from hundreds of meters (outcrop) to millimeters (laboratory specimens). The purpose of this study is to map mineral composition at an outcrop scale and relatively quantify lateral and vertical mineralogical variations caused by diagenetic processes at microscopic scale. Visible Near-Infrared (VNIR) and Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral cameras were used to scan the mixed-influence, delta-front reservoir analogue in the Cretaceous Frontier Formation, in Wyoming. The uppermost parasequence of Wall Creek Member were scanned at Raptor Ridge and compared with previous sedimentological studies that mapped discrete carbonate concretions. In addition, two cores (10 meters long), located 30-50 meters away from the outcrop wall, were scanned in the laboratory in order to collect very high resolution spectral data (at 0.5 cm interval). The normalized spectra, using continuum removal, at specific band for target minerals were plotted to evaluate the relative abundance of calcite, chlorite and kaolinite cement within the sandstone based on location, depth and width of absorption features. The hyperspectral images were classified using multiple spectral classification techniques: Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) and Mixture Tuned Mached Filter (MTMF) based on spectral data collected by spectroradiometer. Results show fast and precise method for mapping relative abundance of minerals at various scales ranging from outcrop to laboratory\\core samples. Data are further used for understanding complex diagenetic processes and for reservoir analogue studies.",

            "abstract": "We present a 1.3 million year record of hydroclimate in the basin of Lake Malawi, the second deepest lake in Africa, located at ~10 - 15ºS latitude in the East African Rift Valley. The lake is ~550 km long, has a maximum depth of 706 m, and is presently anoxic below ~200 m. While the lake is an open basin today with outflow through the Shire River at its southern end, the surface of Lake Malawi has dropped well below the elevation of its outlet on several occasions in its past. We examined a 380 m sediment sequence taken from a water depth of 590 m, from Cores MAL05-1B and MAL05-1C of the Lake Malawi Drilling Project. Sediment samples were analyzed for the carbon isotopic composition of the C29 – C33 n-alkanes derived from fossil leaf waxes, which primarily reflect the relative abundance of C3 (mostly trees and shrubs) and C4 (mostly grass) vegetation, i.e., relatively humid or arid conditions, respectively, in the lake basin. The δ13Cwax  record portrays a transition from a highly variable and predominantly arid climate prior to 900 ka to a progressively more humid environment after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, dominated by 100 ky cycles consisting of warm, wet interglacial periods alternating with relatively cool, dry glacial periods. This shift towards more humid conditions in the Lake Malawi basin contrasts with the well-documented progression towards a more arid environment in North Africa over the same period, as reflected in the carbon isotopic record of soil carbonates and in dust records from marine sediment recovered from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Aden. Aridification in the Horn of Africa has been attributed to a cooling of the Indian Ocean. Model results suggest that this would be accompanied by a weakening of a localized Walker circulation over the Indian Ocean, less ascending air over the western Indian Ocean and coastal Africa, and more precipitation in the Rift Valley.",

            "abstract": "Over the last year we implemented a complete restructuring of a second year Matlab-based course on numerical modelling of Earth processes, with changes aimed at 1) strengthening students' independence as programmers, 2) addressing student concerns about support in developing coding skills, and 3) improving key modelling skills such as choosing boundary conditions. To address this, we designed a mastery-based approach where students progress through a series of small programming projects at their own pace. As part of this, all lectures are `flipped' into short videos, allowing all contact hours to be spent on programming. The projects themselves are structured based on a `bottlenecks to learning' approach, explicitly separating out the steps of learning new commands and code structures, creating a conceptual and mathematical model of the problem, and development of more generic programmings skills such as debugging before asking the students to combine all of the above to build a numerical model of an Earth Sciences problem.\nCompared with the previous, traditionally taught cohort, student questionnaires show a strong improvement in overall satisfaction. Free text responses show a focus on learning for understanding, and that students particularly valued the encouragement to slow down and work towards understanding when they encountered a difficult topic, rather than being pressured by a set timetable to move on. Quantitatively, exam performance improved on key conceptual questions, such as boundary conditions and discretisation, and overall achievement also rose, with 25\\% of students achieving an `A+' standard of work. Many of the final projects also demonstrated programming and modelling skills that had not been directly taught, ranging from use of new commands to extension of techniques taught in 1D to the 2D case: strong confirmation of the independent skills we aimed to foster with this new approach.",

            "abstract": "Seasonally dry tropical forests in Africa (SDTFs), such as forests in Miombo Woodlands, are experiencing high rates of deforestation, degradation and regrowth. Increasing proportions of forest are disturbed or composed of young regrowth stands (<40 yr), yet the degree and dynamics of how forest structure, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling recover with regrowth are poorly understood. Here, we examine how forest structure, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling change with regrowth following cultivation in forests of western Tanzania’s Miombo. This work addresses 3 questions: (1) What are the timescales of aboveground tree C stock recovery and patterns of soil mineral N availability with regrowth; (2) How does N demand for tree leaf production compare to indicators of available mineral N in surface soils from young to mature forest sites; (3) How does canopy structure vary with regrowth and disturbance and scale to Landsat-style satellite data? We established a chronosequence of 18 sites with ages 3 to >40 years since abandonment. At each, we inventoried trees to quantify aboveground tree C stocks, sampled soils to 100 cm to measure C, total and mineral N (NH4+, NO3-), and surveyed canopy cover with point-line transects, spherical densiometer and photometric leaf area measures. We also conducted soil incubations to determine nitrogen mineralization potentials. Tree C stocks ranged from 0.4 ± 0.1 Mg C ha-1 for 3-4 year sites to 27.2 ± 5.2 Mg C ha-1 for 30-40 year sites, and were 44.5 ± 7.4 Mg C ha-1 for mature forest sites. Rates of aboveground tree C stock changes (0.78 – 0.89 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) were comparable to the few published for Miombo forests. However, tree C stocks at 10 - 24 year sites (5.2 ± 1.1 Mg C ha -1) were much lower than those reported in comparable studies. Only sites > 30-40 years had C stocks approaching mature forests. Further analyses will compare N dynamics from leaves and soil across the chronosequence, and relate them to the trends in tree C stocks. We use ground and canopy cover data to test remote sensing characterizations of land cover across disturbed and regrowth sites. Such scaling relationships will allow us to improve remote sensing characterization of land cover in African SDTFs and develop landscape-scale estimates of how forest cover changes affect C, N and water cycling regionally.",

            "abstract": "Shallow streambed water temperature is a driving factor for Pacific salmon egg incubation. Small (1 to 2 oC) increases in incubation period water temperature may accelerate embryo development. We collected year-round water temperature data at 14 salmon spawning areas on the Copper River Delta (CRD), a 100 km wide coastal foreland in Southcentral Alaska. Our data show considerable temporal and spatial heterogeneity in shallow streambed water temperatures. Different water sources (precipitation vs. groundwater) and a spectrum of hydraulic conductivity and pressure head conditions were also observed. Landscape-scale patterns were not adequately characterized by typical watershed metrics including elevation, area, and slope. We found that catchment- and reach- scale geomorphology and surficial geology govern the surface-groundwater interactions that determine shallow streambed water temperature. The observed differences indicate that, across the CRD landscape, shallow streambed water temperature will not respond equally to projected climatic changes. Water temperature sensitivity to atmospheric conditions also varied by season, suggesting that year-round water temperature data are valuable for assessing potential climate change impacts to Pacific salmon in catchments where incubation period air temperatures are projected to exceed the freezing point with increasing frequency.

Additionally, muon data can be jointly inverted with other data such as gravity and seismic to produce higher quality earth models than produced from a single method. We collected several weeks of data in a tunnel to image a vertical shaft. The minimum length of rock between the vertical shaft and the detector is 120 meters and the diameter of the vertical shaft is 4.6 meters. The rock the muons traveled through consists of Tertiary age volcanic tuff and steeply dipping, small-displacement faults. Results will be presented for muon flux in the tunnel and Monte-Carlo simulations of this experiment. Simulations from both GEANT4 (Geometry And Tracking version 4) and MCNP6 (Monte-Carlo N-Particle version 6) models will be compared. The tunnel overburden from muon measurements is also estimated and compared with actual the overburden.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most adverse environmental problems of the mine industry. Surface water and ground water affected by this pollution are characterized by their acidity and the high content of sulfates and heavy metals.\nIn this study, alkaline clay, an industrial waste with a high pH, which is utilized in the alumina refining process, was used as the remediation material to inhibit pyrite oxidation. Through a series of batch and column experiments, complemented with field measurements and geochemical modeling, three important issues associated with this passive and auto sustainable acid mine drainage remediation method were investigated: 1) the potential use of alkaline clay as an AMD remediation material, 2) the adequate alkaline clay/coal refuse mixing ratio (AC/CR) to ensure pH values near to neutral conditions, and, 3) the prediction of long term impacts, in terms of the trends of the main parameters involved in this process such as pH, concentrations of sulfate, iron and other dissolved contaminants. Both field measurements and the samples used for the experiments came from a coal waste site located in Mather, Pennsylvania.\nAlkaline clay proved to be an effective remediation material for AMD. It was found that 10% AC/CR is an adequate mixing ratio (i.e. the upper limit), which has been also indicated by field measurements. The concentrations of some contaminants such as iron, manganese or sulfate are significantly reduced with the remediation approach, compared to those representative concentrations found in mine tailings. Moreover, results suggest a very reliable long-term stability of the remediation (i.e. neutral pH conditions are maintained), thus enhancing the generation of iron precipitates that could produce pyrite grain coating and hardpan (i.e. cemented layer) on the surface. These processes also made the amended layer less porous, thus increasing water retention and hindering oxygen diffusion.",

            "abstract": "Long-term studies of agro-ecosystems at the continental scale are providing an extraordinary understanding of regional environmental dynamics. The new Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) network (established in 2013) has designed an explicit research program with multiple USDA experimental watersheds, ranges and forests for cross-site studies. Here, we report results from studies using a modified scientific method implemented over the past five years with long-term data from USDA experimental sites in coordination with other networks. The method provides a flexible structure to transform an idea to a hypothesis and come to conclusion with the valuable expertise and full participation of the data providers. The results offer a compelling argument for the LTAR concept of combining bottom-up site-based expertise and top-down network-wide coordination to arrive at more accurate scientific conclusions. Simply put, without site-based expertise and cross-site communication, the interpretations and conclusions of these studies would have been incomplete, if not incorrect. Further, the up-front time commitment to data processing and analytics above the time dedicated to place-based studies increased the productivity of the team and the impact of the research, unlike the common perception that cross-site research might be less efficient. In turn, this supported a non-traditional system of credit for co-authors based on publication impact with less regard for author order. The LTAR network has embraced this modified scientific method in its Shared Research Strategy and Common Experiment to address the problematic issues of data quality, co-author credit, research efficiency, and scientific impact in data intensive research. The initial success expressed here with USDA experimental sites bodes well for the LTAR and other such networks going forward.",

            "abstract": "Every discovery has a story and storytelling is an ancient form of education. The stories of scientific discovery are often very formal and technical and not always very accessible. As in the past, today most scientific storytelling is done as in-person presentations in the form of slide shows or movies that unfold according to the design of its author. Things have changed. Using today’s technologies telling stories can be a rich multi-media experience with a blending of text, animations, movies and infographics. Also, with presentations on the web the presentation can provide links to more details and the audience (reader) can jump to the linked information. Even so, the most common form of today’s storytelling is as a narrative that starts with a page, a link to a single movie or a slide-show. We introduce a new promising form of scientific storytelling, the storyboard. With a storyboard a story is presented as a set of panels that contain representative images of an event and may have associated notes or instructions. The panels are arranged in a timeline that allow the audience to experience the discovery in the same way it occurred. A panel can also link to a more detailed source such as a publication, the data that was collected or items derived from the research (like movies or animations). Scientific storyboards can make science discovery more accessible to people by presenting events in an easy to follow layout. Scientific storyboards can also help to teach the scientific method, by following the experiences of a researcher as they investigate a phenomenon or try to understand a new set of observations. We illustrate the unique features of scientific storyboards with the Planetary Data Storyboard using data archived by the Planetary Data System.",

            "abstract": "Population density and economic activities in urban agglomerations have drastically increased in many cities in Mexico during the last decade. Several factors are responsible for increased urbanization such as a shift of people from rural to urban areas while looking for better education, services and job opportunities as well as the natural growth of the urban areas themselves. Urbanization can create great social, economic and environmental pressures and changes which can easily be observed in most urban agglomerations in the world. In this study, we have focused on analyzing tropospheric NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) column trends over Mexican urban areas that have a population of at least one million inhabitants according to the latest 2010 population census. Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements of NO2 conducted by the space-borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the Aura satellite between 2005 and 2014 have been used for this analysis. This dataset has allowed us to obtain a satellite-based 10-year tropospheric NO2 column trend over the most populated Mexican cities which include the dominating metropolitan area of Mexico City with more than twenty million inhabitants as well as ten other Mexican cities with a population ranging between one to five million inhabitants with a wide range of activities (commercial, agricultural or heavily industrialized) as well as two important border crossings. Distribution maps of tropospheric NO2 columns above the studied urban agglomerations were reconstructed from the analyzed OMI dataset, allowing to identify areas of interest due to clear NO2 enhancements inside these urban regions.",

            "abstract": "Exploring for platinum-group elements (PGEs) relies on understanding the geophysical signature of the entire magmatic system in which they form, from bottom to top. New potential field and electromagnetic data and methods effectively map internal structures of layered intrusions that host PGE-bearing magmatic ore deposits, the volume of the intrusion and its extent under cover, and locations of sulfide mineralization. High resolution aeromagnetic data can image fine scale linear anomalies related to layering in the Stillwater and Bushveld Complexes. At Stillwater, the aeromagnetic anomalies relate to boundaries between major stratigraphic units and olivine-bearing rock layers altered to a mixture of serpentine and magnetite. The PGE-enriched sulfide mineralization hosted by olivine-bearing rocks in the Stillwater Complex produces a distinct linear magnetic high. In the Upper Zone of the Bushveld Complex, primary magnetite layers generate linear magnetic highs. Electromagnetic (EM) data over the Stillwater Complex highlight contact-type mineralization which contain low resistivity sulfide minerals. Stochastic inversions reveal a low resistivity zone along the southern edge of the Stillwater Complex corresponding to mineralization in banded iron formation or contact-type sulfide mineralization in the Basal zone. Gravity highs characterize the exposed and interpreted buried extent of the Stillwater and Bushveld complexes. A 3D inversion of gravity data of the Sillwater Complex indicates that the complex extends 30 km north and 40 km east of its outcrop beneath Phanerozoic cover. Geophysical models image the 3D geometry of the Bushveld Complex north of the Thabazimbi-Murchison Lineament (TML), critical for understanding the origin of the world’s largest layered mafic intrusion and associated platinum- group element deposits, as a ~4 km thick, 160 km x ~125 km body underlying ~1-2 km of cover. Locally thick regions in the TML portion of the model may represent feeders to the Bushveld Complex. Magnetotelluric models indicate that the Transvaal sedimentary basin underlies much of the Bushveld Complex north of the TML, further than previously thought and important because the degree of reaction and assimilation of the Transvaal rocks with the mafic magmas resulted in a variety of mineralization zones.",

            "abstract": "Studies in mountainous terrain related to ecology and hydrology often use interpolated climate products because of a lack of local observations. One dataset frequently used to develop plot-to-watershed scale climatologies is the PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) temperature model. Benefits of this approach include geographically-weighted station observations and topographic positioning modifiers, which become important factors for predicting temperature in complex topography. Because of the paucity of long-term climate records in mountain environments, validation of PRISM algorithms across diverse regions remains challenging, with end users instead relying on atmospheric relationships derived in sometimes distant geographic settings. Recent developments of the PRISM model have increased temporal resolution capability from monthly to daily, which in turn has allowed a reasonable test of PRISM performance during a single season at distributed points across a large watershed. Presented are results from testing instrumental observations of daily max/min temperature on 16 sites in the Walker Basin, CA-NV, located on open woodland slopes ranging from 1967 to 3111 m in elevation. Individual site MAE varies from 1.34 to 4.22 C with better performance observed during summertime as opposed to winter. We observe a consistent bias in minimum temperatures for all seasons across all sites, with bias in maximum temperatures varying with season. Model error for minimum is associated strongly with elevation, whereas model error for maximum is associated with topographic radiative indices (solar exposure and heat loading). These results indicate that actual temperature conditions across open mountain woodland slopes are more heterogeneous than interpolated models (such as PRISM) indicate, which in turn impacts prediction/modeling of landscape processes such as ecological niches, bioclimatic refugia, and snow hydrology.",

These include results from 12 sites (125 samples) from basalts of the Vien Nam Formation, exposed at Hoa Binh Dam; eight sites (74 samples) from basalts of the Cam Thuy Formation near Thuan Chau; and 19 sites (198 samples) from andesites and basalts of the Vien Nam Formation near Quynh Nhai. The collection is limited by the quality of exposures and quantity of independent flows. Most sites yield interpretable magnetizations in progressive demagnetization, and the response implies that characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) components are carried by low-titanium magnetite or hematite, or a combination of both; these are isolated from secondary components. Rock magnetic data and petrography support the retention of an early-acquired thermoremanent magnetization in most sites. The Vien Nam Formation mafic volcanic rocks yield a grand mean, in geographic coordinates, of D=33.8o, I=-28.4o ( a95 = 9.5o, k =30.3, N=9 accepted sites), and a pole position at Lat=41.1N, Long=239.8E and a paleolatitude at ~15o S during the Late Permian to Early Triassic. Permian basalts of the Cam Thuy Formation provide a grand mean, corrected for structural tilt, of D=216.1o, I=+10.5o, a95=8.9o, k=107.8, and N= 4, with a pole position at Lat=45.6N, Long=226.8E. Volcanic rocks at the Quynh Nhai locality likely yield the most robust paleofield determination, as the data set is of dual polarity and passes a reversal test. The tilt corrected grand mean (normal polarity) is D=48.3o, I=-10.0o, a95=8.0o, k=27.7, N = 13, and this in turn yields an inferred paleomagnetic pole at Lat=35.7N, Long=217.4E, and a paleolatitude of 5.1oS for the late Permian. Compared with the Late Permian-Early Triassic SCB apparent polar wander path, the data show that volcanic crustal elements of northwest Vietnam, east of the Song Ma suture zone, have been close to, but not unequivocally a coherent part of the SCB, since the Late Permian. Development of the parallel NW-SE striking Song Ma and Song Chay orogenic belts did not involve the closure of wide (> 500 km) ocean basins.",

Water managers are now turning to new models based on the physical processes within a watershed to combat the increasing number of events that do not follow the historical patterns.

The goal of these projects is to not only provide current snowpack estimates but to use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to drive iSnobal in order to produce a forecasted stream flow when coupled to a hydrology model.\nThe first step is to develop methods on how to create snow model forcing data from WRF outputs. Using a reanalysis 1km WRF dataset from WY2009 over the Boise River Basin, WRF model results like surface air temperature, relative humidity, wind, precipitation, cloud cover, and incoming long wave radiation must be downscaled for use in iSnobal. iSnobal results forced with WRF output are validated at point locations throughout the basin, as well as compared with iSnobal results forced with traditional weather station data. The presentation will explore the differences in forcing data derived from WRF outputs and weather stations and how this affects the snowpack distribution.",

This paper, that algorithm, those people lie at the heart of a lineage of scientists whose collaborations and linked individual pursuits have made a significant contribution to our understanding of radiative transfer and climate, of aerosol properties and the global aerosol system, of cloud physics and aerosol-cloud interaction, and how to measure these parameters and maximize the science that can be obtained from those measurements. The ‘lineage’ had its origins across the globe, from Soviet Russia to France, from the U.S. to Israel, from the Himalayas, the Sahel, the metropolises of Sao Paulo, Taipei, and the cities of east and south Asia. It came together in the 1990s and 2000s at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, using cultural diversity as a strength to form a common culture of scientific creativity that continues to this day. The original algorithm has spawned daughter algorithms that are being applied to new satellite and airborne sensors.

            "abstract": "The recently proposed model of surface heat fluxes, based on the theory of maximum entropy production (MEP), was used to estimate the global evapotranspiration (ET) and heat fluxes. Compared to bulk transfer models, the MEP model has several remote-sensing-friendly features including fewer input variables, automatic closure of surface energy budget, being independent of bulk gradients of temperature and water vapor, not using wind speed and surface roughness as model parameters, and being less sensitive to uncertainties of input variables and model parameters. The MEP model is formulated for the entire range of soil moisture from dryness to saturation over the land surfaces and has even more advantages over water-snow-ice surfaces compared to traditional methods due to its independence of surface humidity data. The MEP model provides the first global maps of water heat fluxes at ocean surfaces as well as conductive heat fluxes at snow/ice covered polar regions. Ten years of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) earth surface radiation fluxes, surface temperature data products supplemented (when needed) by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) surface specific humidity data are used to test the MEP model by comparing the MEP based global annual ET and heat fluxes with existing products. The MEP based fluxes over land surfaces agree closely with previous studies. Over the oceans, the MEP modeled ET tends to be lower than previous estimates while those of sensible heat fluxes are in close agreement with previous studies. A counterpart, “off-line” analysis is also carried out using the NOAA GFDL climate model output from a control experiment and a “warming” experiment. Substantial differences in the warming-related changes of ET and Bowen ratio are found over regions such as North Africa and the southwestern U.S. The implications of these differences for understanding trends and variability in regional energy and water cycle will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Secondary aerosol (SOA) formation has been linked to health problems and environmental damage in regions impacted by the emission of gaseous NH3 and SO2. SOA formation, (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3, in the presence of NO NO2, is favored under high relative humidity and low temperature and low temperature conditions. In the East and Mid Atlantic regions of the United States humidity is low in wintertime. Utilizing ambient concentration data of gaseous NO, NO2, SO2 and NH3 collected aboard a survey aircraft we examined the partitioning of gaseous NH3 towards aerosol products. The calculated mixing ratio of gaseous SO2/NH3 correlated with relative humidity will give an indication of the potential SOA formation when the mixing ratio of other reactants is small in the region of interest. The data obtained originates from a series of night and day survey flights on a C-130 aircraft that occurred from February 3 to March 13, 2015 over the Eastern coastal region of the United States extending from New York to Florida. NOx was obtained from the Airborne Ring-down Nitrogen Oxide Laser Detector (ARNOLD) instrument (NOAA) and Thermal Dissociation-Laser Induced Fluorescence (TD-LIF) (UC Berkley). SO2 measurements were done using the TECO 43C SO2 analyzer and for NH3 measurements the an Ammonia Analyzer - Trace (NH3) (Los Gatos Research).

            "abstract": "Mining-induced earthquakes with magnitudes equal to or larger than 2 take place only a few tens of meters away from active workings in South African gold mines several times a year. The largest event recorded in a South African mining region, a M5.5 earthquake, took place on 5 August 2014, with the upper edge of the activated fault being some hundred meters below the nearest mine workings (3.0 km depth). The depth and the strike-slip fault mechanism were very different from usual mining-induced events. This is one of the rare events for which detailed seismological data are available, both from surface and underground seismometers and strainmeters, allowing for a detailed analysis and comparison with in-situ observed data. This enables us to design a drilling program with a significantly better spatial coverage (potentially including rupture nuclei, strong motion sources, asperities, or rupture edges) than is possible when drilling in seismogenic zones of natural large earthquakes and with further advantages of lower drilling risk and costs.\nIn seismogenic zones in a critical state of stress, it is difficult to delineate reliably the local spatial variations of the directionand magnitude of the principal stresses. However, we have overcome this problem. We are able to numerically model stress better than before, enabling us to orientate boreholes so that the chance of stress-induced damage is minimized, and enabling us to measure the 3D full stress tensor reliably even when stresses are as large as those expected in seismogenic zones. Better recovery of cores with less stress-induced damage is also feasible. These factors will allow us to address key scientific questions in earthquake physics, namely the stress and strength in seismogenic zones, which so far have remained elusive.\nWe will report on the discussions on key scientific objectives, technical feasibility, and the best strategy at a workshop, which ICDP conditionally approved, that we hope will take place in South African in the fourth quarter of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Numerous distinctive depressions were observed on the seafloor during twenty-eight remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives conducted on the shelf edge and upper slope of the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Surface ship and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) multibeam bathymetric maps were used to identify potential methane seepage sites, such as areas with persistent water column acoustic anomalies and the tops of mud volcanoes. ROV dives were conducted at these sites and at background sites for stratigraphic sampling. The high abundance of these distinctive depressions stimulated an analysis of the video observations made on these ROV dives. Depressions were analyzed to document their characteristics, to help determine their origin, and to establish whether their frequency varies with bottom type. One hundred fifty-two of the depressions observed had shared characteristics consisting of an “oval-shaped” depression with raised ridged edges that extended laterally along the flanks, and traces of uplifted sediment either in or around the depression. Similar depressions have been called “gouge marks” and attributed to bottom feeding beaked whales in previous studies. The size and water depth of the measured depressions matched well with beak sizes and feeding depths of beaked whale species known to exist in this area. This supports the conclusion that beaked whales created the depressions. The occurrence of these gouge marks and the estimates of the total area observed on these ROV dives (~45,000 m2), suggests they are common (e.g., ~4,000 per km2) features on the seafloor in this area of the Arctic. Gouges were also found 2.25 times more often at suspected methane seep-sites when normalized for depth and area. This suggests that the whales are preferentially attracted to seepage sites. While the reason for this possible preferential feeding behavior is unknown, it provides an intriguing avenue for further research.",

As part of its processing it uses surface temperature, an atmospheric temperature profile and a water vapor profile from analysis. Since there are many analysis products on the market (e.g. GMAO, NCEP, ECMWF etc.) that meet MOPITT’s operational requirements, the question arises as to which product is most apt? There is a collection of “validation data” that MOPITT compares its CO retrievals against\n[4]\n. The validation dataset has been acquired by in situ air samples taken by aircraft at a series of altitudes. We can run our processing system in “validation mode” which processes the satellite data for only the days that validation data exists and for a spatial subset that corresponds to the region where the validation data has been collected. We will run the MOPITT retrievals in validation mode separately using each variety of analysis data. We will create a cost function that will provide a scalar estimate of the retrieved CO profile error relative to the validation dataset which is assumed to be “the truth”. The retrieval errors of each of the input datasets will be compared to each other to provide insight into the best choice for use in operational MOPITT processing.\n\n[1] Drummond, J.R., “Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT),” in The Use of EOS for Studies of Atmospheric Physics, J.

            "abstract": "A limited amount of knowledge exists on the large-scale characteristics and differences of pathogenic species in comparison to all prokaryotes. Pathogenic species, like other prokaryotes, have attributes specific to their environment and lifestyles. However, because they have evolved to coexist inside their hosts, the conditions they occupy may be more limited than those of non-pathogenic species. In this study we investigate the possibility of divergent evolution between pathogenic and non-pathogenic species by examining differences that may have evolved as a result of the need to adapt to their host.\nFor this research we analyzed data collected from over 1900 prokaryotic species and performed t-tests using R to quantify potential differences in preferences. To examine the possible divergences from nonpathogenic bacteria, we focused on three variables: cell biovolume, preferred environmental pH, and preferred environmental temperature. We also looked at differences between pathogenic and nonpathogenic species belonging to the same phylum. Our results suggest a strong divergence in abiotic preferences between the two groups, with pathogens occupying a much smaller range of temperatures and pHs than their non-pathogenic counterparts. However, while the median biovolume is different when comparing pathogens and nonpathogens, we cannot conclude that the mean values are significantly different from each other. In addition, we found evidence of convergent evolution, as the temperature and pH preferences of pathogenic bacteria species from different phlya all approach the same values. Pathogenic species do not, however, all approach the same biovolume values, suggesting that specific pH and temperature preferences are more characteristic of pathogens than certain biovolumes.",

The statistical properties of the waves are important for evaluating their impact on energetic particles during storms. Using Van Allen Probes (RBSP) data during ~10 storms from October 2012 to July 2014, we investigate the spatial distribution and storm-time occurrence of Pc4 (7-25 mHz) poloidal waves in the inner magnetosphere. Pc4 poloidal waves are sorted into two categories: waves with and without significant magnetic compressional components. Major statistic results from these 10 storms are: 1) Both types of poloidal waves have much higher occurrence rate during storms. 2) The non-compressional (guided) poloidal waves mostly occurred in the late recovery phase, suggesting an internal wave source related to the decay of the ring current. 3) The dayside compressional Pc4 poloidal waves are strongly correlated with the storm-time variations of the solar wind dynamic pressure, indicating their external wave source in the solar wind. 4) Both compressional and non-compressional waves preferentially occur on the dayside near noon at L~5-6.

            "abstract": "Stream water mean transit time (MTT) is a fundamental hydrologic parameter that integrates the distribution of sources, flow paths and storages present in catchments. However, in the tropics little work has been carried out on MTT, despite its usefulness for providing important information about watershed hydrological functioning at different spatial scales in (largely) ungauged basins. In particular, very few studies have quantified stream MTTs and related to catchment characteristics in tropical montane regions. Here we examined topographic, land use/cover and soil hydraulic controls on baseflow MTT for nested watersheds (0.1–34 km2) within a humid mountainous region, underlain by volcanic soil (Andisols) in central Veracruz (eastern Mexico). To estimate MTTs, we used a 2 year record of bi-weekly isotopic composition of precipitation and stream baseflow data. Land use/cover and topographic parameters were derived from GIS analysis. Soil profile hydraulic properties and permeability at the soil-bedrock interface were obtained from intensive field measurements and laboratory analysis. Estimates of baseflow MTT ranged between 1.2 and 2.7 years across the 12 study catchments. Major differences in MTTs were found at the small (0.1–1.5 km2) and at the large scales (14–34 km2), related mostly to catchment slope and morphology and, to much lesser extent, to land cover. Interestingly, longest stream MTTs were found in the cloud forest headwater catchments. Overall, MTTs were mainly controlled by depth to bedrock associated with topography, and permeability at the soil-bedrock interface. Mid and ridge hillslope positions appeared to be the main contributing areas for catchment recharge and runoff. The present study is the first step towards to understand the hydrology and subsurface processes across scales in this tropical environment, with the aim to support decisions for local and regional management water supply under increasing land use and climate change pressures.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic flank destabilization, preceded by pressurization-induced surface deformation or weakening, presents a significant hazard at stratovolcanoes with ample supply of magmatic volatiles or preexisting hydrothermal systems as in Bezymianny- and Bandai-type eruptions, respectively. Deformation is also an important sign of the nature of unrest at large calderas such as Long Valley, USA. Previous studies of volcanic inflation have focused primarily on the role of ascending magma. Relatively few studies have centered on surface deformation caused by pressurization from other volcanic fluids, including exsolved volatiles and pressurized hydrothermal systems. Most investigations of pore-pressurization have focused on numerical modelling of pore pressure transients. In analog experiments presented here, pore-filling fluids are injected into the base of a damp sand medium without exceeding dike propagating pressures, simulating the pressurization and bulk-permeable flow of volatile fluids through volcanic systems. The experiments examine surface deformation from a range of source depths and pressures as well as edifice geometries. 3D imaging is possible through use of the Microsoft® Kinect™ sensor, which allows for the generation of high-resolution, high frame rate, lab-scale Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). After initial processing to increase signal-to-noise ratio, surface deformation is measured using the DEM time-series generated by the Kinect™. Analysis of preliminary experiments suggests that inflation is possible up to approx. 10 % of pressure source depth. We also show that the Kinect™ sensor is useful in analog volcanological studies, an environment to which it is well-suited.",

            "abstract": "Temperature-depth well data along with electromagnetic (EM) data were collected by students of the Summer of Applied Geophysics Experience (SAGE) 2015 field season in the Espanola Basin, New Mexico. The data from this year, in addition to data acquired since 2013, were used to construct a conceptual east-west cross-section of the Espanola Basin and the adjacent highlands in order to evaluate the regional flow system. Vertical geothermal gradients from several monitoring wells were measured using a thermistor. Anomalously warm geothermal gradients were mapped in the Cerros del Rio volcanic field in the basin just east of the Rio Grande. Temperature gradients are up to 70℃/km, while the background geothermal gradients in the Rio Grande rift zone generally show 28℃-35℃/km. This anomaly extends to the Buckman well field, which supplies water to the city of Santa Fe. Overpumping of this well field has led to subsidence in the past. However, discharge temperature plots indicate that the temperature gradients of the Buckman field may be rebounding as pumping is reduced.\nAudiomagnetotelluric (AMT) and transient electromagnetic (TEM) data were acquired in the vicinity of three monitoring wells. TEM and AMT methods complement each other with the former having depths of investigation of less than ten to hundreds of meters and AMT having depths of investigation comparable to the wells deeper than 500m. These datasets were used collectively to image the subsurface stratigraphy and, more specifically, the hydrogeology related to shallow aquifers. The EM data collected at these wells showed a trend indicating a shallow aquifer with a shallower resistive layer of approximately 100 ohm-m at 70-100 meters depth. Beneath this resistive layer we resolved a more conductive, clay-rich layer of 10 ohm-m. These resistivity profiles compliment the electrical logs provided by Jet West, which indicate shallower sandstone interbedded with silt on top of more silt-dominant layers.\nOur proposed conceptual model of the regional flow system in the Espanola Basin addresses the anomalously high geothermal gradients in the monitoring wells in and near the Cerros del Rio volcanic field in addition to the recovering water levels in the Buckman well field.",

            "abstract": "Hypervelocity impacts frequently generate an observable “flash” of light with two components: a short-duration spike due to emissions from vaporized material, and a long-duration peak due to thermal emissions from expanding hot debris. The intensity and duration of these peaks depend on the impact velocity, angle, and the target and projectile mass and composition. Thus remote sensing measurements of planetary impact flashes have the potential to constrain the properties of impacting meteors and improve our understanding of impact flux and cratering processes. Interpreting impact flash measurements requires a thorough understanding of how flash characteristics correlate with impact conditions. Because planetary-scale impacts cannot be replicated in the laboratory, numerical simulations are needed to provide this insight for the solar system. Computational hydrocodes can produce detailed simulations of the impact process, but they lack the radiation physics required to model the optical flash. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) developed a model to calculate the optical signature from the hot debris cloud produced by an impact. While the phenomenology of the optical signature is understood, the details required to accurately model it are complicated by uncertainties in material and optical properties and the simplifications required to numerically model radiation from large-scale impacts. Comparisons with laboratory impact experiments allow us to validate our approach and to draw insight regarding processes that occur at all scales in impact events, such as melt generation. We used Sandia National Lab’s CTH shock physics hydrocode along with the optical signature model developed at APL to compare with a series of laboratory experiments conducted at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range. The experiments used Pyrex projectiles to impact pumice powder targets with velocities ranging from 1 to 6 km/s at angles of 30 and 90 degrees with respect to horizontal. High-speed radiometer measurements were made of the time-dependent impact flash at wavelengths of 350-1100 nm. We will present comparisons between these measurements and the output of APL’s model. The results of this validation allow us to determine basic relationships between observed optical signatures and impact conditions.",

            "abstract": "Issuing warning of a tsunami in advance of its arrival to the coastlines immediately adjacent to large earthquakes remains a challenging problem. The heterogeneous development state of regional geophysical monitoring infrastructure across subduction zones worldwide means that a flexible approach to warning, capable of ingesting multiple data types and earthquake source products, is the most appealing. We will present results from the study of 3 recent large events that have been observed with diverse geophysical measurements; the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-oki, the 2010 Mw8.8 Maule and 2014 Mw8.2 Iquique events. First, we will show that earthquake slip models derived from combination of land (GPS and strong motion) as well as off-shore (tide gauges, ocean-bottom pressure, and GPS buoy) can be coupled to tsunami propagation models to produce simulations that closely match the measured run-up at the local coastlines. Using these models as a baseline for validation we will demonstrate a methodology that takes advantage of simpler, but more readily available earthquake source products such as rapid point-source magnitude estimates from coastal GPS observations and regional moment tensors. We will show that while trading-off precision for speed, these simpler earthquake source models produce inundation forecasts reliable enough to be used for warning within minutes of earthquake onset. Most subduction zones around the world already have some geophysical infrastructure and are producing some form of real-time earthquake source product, our results strongly argue that by coupling these data products to tsunami propagation models local tsunami warning is possible at most subduction zones with already available infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) is a popular remediation technology that involves injection of chemical oxidant into groundwater to destroy dissolved and non-aqueous liquid phase contaminants. Depending on site conditions, oxidant can be injected into the contaminated subsurface periodically (intermittently) or continuously. A common approach is to intermittently inject oxidant into a network of wells over a period long enough to emplace oxidant over a target treatment volume (referred to ISCO-int). The injection phase is followed by a passive phase when the oxidant is allowed to react with contaminants and natural oxygen demand (NOD) and to migrate under natural hydraulic gradients. This process may be repeated multiple times until termination criteria are met. Recently, some practitioners have adopted an alternative approach in which oxidant is injected continuously with extraction wells recovering unreacted oxidant to recycle with additional makeup oxidant to maintain its constant concentration (referred to ISCO-cont). Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages. This study numerically evaluates those two ISCO practices in terms of remediation costs and performance based on multiple equi-probable parameter sets. Stochastic cost optimization toolbox (SCOToolkit) is used for this purpose. SCOToolkit is an integrated semi-analytical model for contaminant transport and remediation (e.g., thermal source treatment, ISCO, electron donor injections, permeable reactive barriers) enabling inverse solution and Monte Carlo simulations. Four different aquifer settings, slow and fast Darcy velocities combined with low and high NOD conditions, are used for the evaluation. Preliminary results showed that ISCO-cont is effective for a full scale application without large investment while ISCO-int is more efficient to utilize oxidant in well-characterized sites. Pros and cons of each approach are discussed for the practical use of ISCO for various site conditions.",

            "abstract": "The stability and mobility of deep mantle melts depend on relative densities of the constituent melts and surrounding solid materials. Iron perhaps is the most important component that influences the density of the relevant melts. However, the inclusion of Fe into melt simulations is challenging. We have recently performed first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of (Mg,Fe)O and MORB melts within density functional theory with the use of spin LDA/GGA. These simulations allow us to assess the effects of Fe on melt structure and properties. In particular, the calculated densities of the Fe-bearing melts increase rapidly with increasing pressure with their values even exceeding the seismic mantle density at some depths. We find that the MORB density is higher than the mantle density around 14 and 23 GPa corresponding to the 410 and 670 km seismic discontinuities, and also at all pressures above 70 GPa. For (Mg,Fe)O system, the calculated iso-chemical density differences become so small at high pressure that an excess of as low as 5 wt.% Fe dissolved in the liquid phase would be sufficient to cause the liquid-solid density crossover. Our first-principles results thus support the possibility that Fe-bearing melts may be buoyantly stable in the deep mantle.",

            "abstract": "The physical mechanisms of multiphase flow in porous media are more complex in comparison to single-phase flow. Although experimental and numerical results at all scales are useful to develop understanding, fluid flow ultimately occurs through the pore and fracture networks of rocks, sands, and shales. Accordingly, this talk focuses on pore-scale displacement mechanisms obtained using etched-silicon micromodels. Such micromodels have the pore network pattern and pore sizes of a real rock etched into a silicon wafer. Importantly, these micromodels permit direct, high-magnification, time-lapse observations of fluid movement through pores.\nA significant new tool in microfluidic research is particle image velocity (micro-PIV) to monitor pore-scale velocity distributions and their history. We make such measurements in micromodels using simple optical equipment combined with efficient image acquisition and processing. Pore-scale velocity distributions are obtained for single-phase flow in porous media with typical pore sizes of 5 to 40 µm at vector-grid resolutions as fine as 2 µm by 2 µm. The single-phase images and measurements are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Micro-PIV during unstable immiscible two-phase flow experiments (drainage of the wetting phase) reveals that flow is oscillatory long before the arrival of the invading interface. The dynamics include abrupt changes of velocity magnitude and direction as well as interfacial jumps. Following the passage of the front, dissipative events, such as eddies and recirculations within the aqueous phase are observed when interrogated with micro-PIV. These observations of complex interface dynamics at the pore scale motivate reconsideration of the standard multiphase extension of Darcy’s law that commonly neglects interfacial and viscous dissipation.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty over the sign and magnitude of environmental forcing agents on fluxes of tropical forest carbon could be reduced with measurements of canopy photosynthesis. But no existing method can quantify photosynthesis within individual plants at scales larger than a few cm. Portable leaf chambers can determine leaf-level gas exchange, and eddy-covariance instruments infer the net ecosystem-atmosphere carbon flux. These endpoints represent an axis of granularity and extent. Single leaf measurements are finely grained, but necessarily limited in extent, and gas exchange for whole landscapes cannot resolve the performance or contributions of individual plants. This limits the ability of scientists to test mechanistic demographic and physiological hypotheses about the drivers of photosynthesis in ecosystems, and therefore to understand the determinants of carbon fluxes between tropical ecosystems and the atmosphere. Here I describe a framework to overcome these challenges using a program of drone-enabled remote sensing measurements of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) coupled with ground-based physiological studies to understand the determinants of photosynthesis within leaves, individual organisms and large landscapes. The Brown Platform for Autonomous Remote Sensing (BPAR) is a suite of sensors carried by a gas-powered helicopter drone. By conducting frequent, low-altitude flights BPAR can produce VNIR imaging spectroscopy time series with measurements separated by minutes to hours at ground sample distances of 1 cm. The talk will focus on how measurements of SIF at these spatial and temporal scales can be coupled with models to infer the rate of electron transport and carbon assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Earth's liquid core hosts a diverse set of waves with periods ranging from days to thousands of years. One class of waves with periods of several decades are known to arise from an interplay between magnetic, Archimedes and Coriolis forces. These so-called MAC waves are thought to be relevant for interpreting historical fluctuations in the geomagnetic field. We show that MAC waves provide a good description of time-dependent zonal flow at the top of the core. The same collection of waves also offers a simple explanation for observed fluctuations in the dipole field. Both of these predictions require a 140-kilometer-thick stratified layer at the top of the core with a buoyancy frequency comparable to Earth's rotation rate. We extend these predictions to include changes in the length of day and find that MAC waves can account for about half of the observed fluctuation at decadal periods. Larger fluctuations are possible when electromagnetic stresses couple MAC waves to flow in the interior of the core. In fact, an idealized model for the coupled system over estimates the length-of-day fluctuations, possibly reflecting limitations in the idealized model. The waves do not discriminate between thermal and compositional stratification at the top of the core, but the properties of the layer are compatible with thermal stratification, implying a core heat flow of 13 TW relative to an adiabatic heat flow of 15 TW.",

Multiple techniques have been developed to identify the methane signal in spectra and map emissions from AVIRIS imagery. The spectral detection approach is applied to reflected radiance and therefore land cover and albedo directly affect the sensitivity of detection techniques to methane enhancement. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of a cluster tuned matched filter and SWIR band ratio for methane detection while varying land cover type and albedo. Sensitivity analysis was performed using a synthetic AVIRIS scene consisting of 30 land cover types, 10 albedo values per type, and 10 methane concentrations distributed above the synthetic scene. We ran the cluster tuned matched filter and SWIR band ratio over the synthetic AVIRIS image and analyzed the results. Findings suggest that the SWIR band ratio is able to successfully detect methane anomalies independent of land cover and albedo while the cluster tuned matched filter is more dependent on the land cover and overall diversity within a scene. These results provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of methane detections over a range of surfaces and albedos. In addition this will also help us to begin to use remote sensing to not only qualitatively map the presence of methane anomalies but also quantitatively estimate methane fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Extratropical cyclones contribute most of the precipitation in the midlatitudes, i.e. up to 70% during winter in the northern hemisphere, and can generate flooding, extreme winds, blizzards and have large socio-economic impacts. As such, it is important that general circulation models (GCMs) accurately represent these systems so their evolution in a warming climate can be understood. However, there are still uncertainties on whether warming will increase their frequency of occurrence, their intensity and how much rain or snow they bring. Part of the issue is that models have trouble representing their strength, but models also have biases in the amount of clouds and precipitation they produce. This is caused by potential issues in various aspects of the models: convection, boundary layer, and cloud scheme to only mention a few.\nIn order to pinpoint which aspects of the models need improvement for a better representation of extratropical cyclone precipitation and cloudiness, we will present A-train based observational metrics: cyclone-centered, warm and cold frontal composites of cloud amount and type, precipitation rate and frequency of occurrence. Using the same method to extract similar fields from the model, we will present an evaluation of the GISS-ModelE2 and the IPSL-LMDZ-5B models, based on their AR5 and more recent versions. The AR5 version of the GISS model underestimates cloud cover in extratropical cyclones while the IPSL AR5 version overestimates it.\nIn addition, we will show how the observed CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud vertical distribution across cold fronts changes with moisture amount and cyclone strength, and test if the two models successfully represent these changes. We will also show how CloudSat-CALIPSO derived cloud type (i.e. convective vs. stratiform) evolves across warm fronts as cyclones age, and again how this is represented in the models. Our third process-based analysis concerns cumulus clouds in the post-cold frontal region and how their amount relates to the stability of the boundary layer. This test uses Aqua cloud and vertical atmospheric profiles and when applied to the model output can help assess the accuracy of the convection, boundary layer and cloud scheme.",

In this study, we used the GPS total electron content (TEC) measurements from the Low-latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (LISN) to monitor the temporal development and map the geographic distribution of ionospheric bubbles/depletions over South America. A special TEC data detrending technique (known as the guided-rotation assisted ionospheric TEC detrender, or GRAIT-Detrender) had been developed in order to recognize the presence of bubbles/depletions, distinguishing them from wavelike structures associated with traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). Using data collected from ~240 GPS receivers in the Caribbean and South America, the detrended TEC data were subsequently compiled to form a full 2-D spatial profile of the bubbles/depletions in the region. We further corroborate the compiled 2-D ΔTEC map using additional data from ground-based ionosonde measurements as well as in-situ ion density measurements from C/NOFS.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the atmosphere provide one of the main chemical mechanisms for the removal of trace gases. OH plays a central role in determining the atmospheric lifetime and radiative forcing of greenhouse gases like methane. OH also plays a major role in the oxidation of organic trace gases, which can lead to formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and PM2.5. Due to its very short atmospheric lifetime of seconds or less, OH concentrations are extremely variable in space and time, which makes measurements and their interpretation very challenging. Several recent measurements have yielded higher than expected OH concentrations. To explain these would require the existence of unidentified, radical recycling processes, but issues with the measurements themselves are also still being discussed.\nDuring the NOAA airborne SENEX study in the Southeast U.S., the biogenic hydrocarbons isoprene and monoterpenes were consistently found to have lower mixing ratios in air masses with enhanced nitrogen oxides from power plants. We attribute this to faster oxidation rates of biogenic hydrocarbons due to increased concentrations of OH in the power plant plumes. Measurements at different downwind distances from the Scherer and Harllee Branch coal-fired power plants near Atlanta are used to constrain the dependence of OH on nitrogen oxides. It is found that OH concentrations were highest at nitrogen dioxide concentrations of 1-2 ppbv and decreased at higher and at lower concentrations. These findings agree with the expected dependence of OH on nitrogen oxide concentrations, but do not appear to be consistent with the reports in the literature that have shown high OH concentrations in regions of the atmosphere with high biogenic emissions and low NOx concentrations that would require unidentified radical recycling processes to be explained.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA Southeast Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (SENEX) study was focused on biogenic and anthropogenic emissions in the Southeast United States, their interactions to form oxidants and aerosol, and the implications of these processes for air quality and climate. For SENEX, the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft was deployed out of a regional airport in Smyrna, Tennessee during June and July of 2013. The aircraft carried an extensive suite of instruments to characterize the gas- and aerosol-phase composition of the atmosphere, as well as the climate-relevant properties of the aerosol. The SENEX study was performed in close collaboration with several other studies in the framework of the Southeast Atmosphere Study.\nSome highlights of the measurements will be presented with a particular focus on the processes by which anthropogenic and biogenic emissions interact to form secondary species including aerosol. The FLEXPART Lagrangian transport model was found to be a useful tool to quantify the relative contribution from anthropogenic and biogenic emissions to different trace species in the sampled air masses. Observations in power plant plumes provided constraints on the dependence of hydroxyl radical concentrations on nitrogen oxides (NOx). Oxidation rates were higher at enhanced concentrations of NOx, leading to faster production of products from biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in polluted conditions. Organic aerosol was formed from isoprene downwind from one power plant that had relatively high sulfur emissions. Nighttime flights were conducted to constrain organic aerosol formation from the reaction between biogenic VOCs and nitrate radicals. The volume of aerosol water depends on aerosol composition (e.g. sulfate versus organics), which has been proposed as a link between anthropogenic emissions and products of aqueous-phase chemistry. Vertical profiles of aerosol volume and composition provided evidence for aqueous-phase formation of sulfate aerosol, but formation of organic aerosol was not significant within the uncertainties of the analysis.",

            "abstract": "The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, NM is the only operating nuclear waste repository in the US and has been accepting transuranic (TRU) waste since 1999. The WIPP is located in a salt deposit approximately 650 m below the surface and performance assessment (PA) modeling for a 10,000 year period is required to recertify the operating license with the US EPA every five years. The main pathway of concern for environmental release of radioactivity is a human intrusion caused by drilling into a pressurized brine reservoir below the repository. This could result in the flooding of the repository and subsequent transport in the high transmissivity layer (dolomite-rich Culebra formation) above the waste disposal rooms. We evaluate the degree of conservatism in the estimated sorption partition coefficients (Kds) ranges used in the PA based on an approach developed with granite rock and actinides (Dittrich and Reimus, 2015; Dittrich et al., 2015). Sorption onto the waste storage material (Fe drums) may also play a role in mobile actinide concentrations. We will present (1) a conceptual overview of how Kds are used in the PA model, (2) technical background of the evolution of the ranges and (3) results from batch and column experiments and model predictions for Kds with WIPP dolomite and clays, brine with various actinides, and ligands (e.g., acetate, citrate, EDTA) that could promote transport. The current Kd ranges used in performance models are based on oxidation state and are 5-400, 0.5-10,000, 0.03-200, and 0.03-20 mL g-1 for elements with oxidation states of III, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Based on redox conditions predicted in the brines, possible actinide species include Pu(III), Pu(IV), U(IV), U(VI), Np(IV), Np(V), Am(III), and Th(IV). We will also discuss the challenges of upscaling from lab experiments to field scale predictions, the role of colloids, and the effect of engineered barrier materials (e.g., MgO) on transport conditions.\nDittrich, T.M., Reimus, P.W. 2015.

The simulation runs from 1900, shortly after the Little Ice Age (LIA), to year 2013, initialized using trimline data marking the former extent of the ice sheet and forced by a surface mass balance reconstruction after Box (2013).

We collect more digital information today than any time before and the volume of data collected is continuously increasing. Some of these data are from unique observations, like those from planetary missions that should be preserved for use by future generations. In addition data from NASA missions are considered federal records and must be retained. While the data may be stored on resilient hardware (i.e. RAID systems) they also must be protected from local or regional disasters. Meeting this challenge requires creating multiple copies. This task is complicated by the fact that new data are constantly being added creating what are called \"active archives\". Having reliable, high performance tools for replicating and synchronizing active archives in a timely fashion is critical to preservation of the data. When archives were smaller using tools like bbcp, rsync and rcp worked fairly well. While these tools are affective they are not optimized for synchronizing big data archives and their poor performance at scale lead us to develop a new tool designed specifically for big data archives. It combines the best features of git, bbcp, rsync and rcp. We call this tool \"Mimic\" and we discuss the design of the tool, performance comparisons and its use at NASA's Planetary Plasma Interactions (PPI) Node of the Planetary Data System (PDS).",

Despite their importance, the location and geometry of flowpaths are difficult to determine. In arctic environments, shallow subsurface flowpaths are limited to a thin zone of seasonal thaw above continuous permafrost, which is traditionally assumed to mimic to surface topography. Here we use a combined approach of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and self-potential measurements (SP) to map shallow subsurface flowpaths in and around water tracks, drainage features common to arctic hillslopes. ERI measurements delineate thawed zones in the subsurface that control flowpaths, while SP is sensitive to groundwater flow. We find that areas of low electrical resistivity in the water tracks are deeper than manual thaw depth estimates and variations from surface topography. This finding suggests that traditional techniques significantly underestimate active layer thaw and the extent of the flowpath network on arctic hillslopes. SP measurements identify complex 3-D flowpaths in the thawed zone. Our results lay the groundwork for investigations into the seasonal dynamics, hydrologic connectivity, and climate sensitivity of spatially distributed flowpath networks on arctic hillslopes.",

Piezometer transects perpendicular to the river at each site were instrumented with HOBO thermistors over a 1.4m screened interval within the saturated zone at 20cm spacing.

An immense amount of energy drives the hydrological cycle and is an important component of various weather and climate patterns. However, the potential of harnessing evaporation has received little attention as a renewable energy resource compared to wind and solar energy. Here, we investigate the potential of harvesting energy from naturally evaporating water. Using weather data across the contiguous United States and a modified model of potential evaporation, we estimate the power availability, intermittency, and the changes in evaporation rates imposed by energy conversion. Our results indicate that natural evaporation can deliver power densities similar to existing renewable energy platforms and require little to no energy storage to match the varying power demands of urban areas. This model also predicts additional, and substantial, water savings by reducing evaporative losses. These findings suggest that evaporative energy harvesting can address significant challenges with water/energy interactions that could be of interest to the hydrology community.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Europa has been a subject of active research during the last few decades both through in-situ and remote sensing observations as well as theoretical considerations. Linking the magnetosphere and the moon’s surface and interior, Europa’s exosphere has become one of the primary objects of study in the field. Understanding the physical processes occurring in the exosphere and its chemical composition is required for the understanding of the interaction between Europa and Jupiter.\nEuropa's surface-bound exosphere originates mostly from ion sputtering of the water ice surface. Minor neutral species and ions of exospheric origin are produced via photolytic and electron impact reactions. The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere and Europa affects the exospheric population of both neutrals and ions via source and loss processes. Moreover, the Lorentz force causes the newly created exospheric ions to move preferably aligned with the magnetic field lines. Contrary to the ions, heavier and slow-moving charged dust grains are mostly affected by gravity and the electric field component of the Lorentz force. As a result, escaping dust forms a narrow tail aligned in the direction of the convection electric field.\nHere we present results of a kinetic model of the neutral species (H2O, OH, O2, O, and H), ions (O+, O2+, H+, H2+, H2O+, and OH+), and neutral and charged dust in Europa’s exosphere. In our model H2O and O2 are produced via sputtering and other exospheric neutral and ions species are produced via photolytic and electron impact reactions. For the charged dust we compute the equilibrium grain charge by balancing the electron and ion collecting currents according to the local plasma flow conditions at the grain’s location. For the tracking of the ions, charged dust, and the calculation of the grains’ charge we use plasma density and velocity, and the magnetic field derived from our multi-fluid MHD model of Europa’s interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere.\nSupport for this work was provided by grant NNX13AI66G from the NASA Planetary Atmospheres Program and RSA 1508179 from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

            "abstract": "Two major field campaigns - The NSF/NCAR and State of Colorado Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPÉ) and the 4thdeployment of the NASA DISCOVER-AQ – were conducted in summer 2014 to study summertime ozone pollution in the Northern Colorado Front Range Metropolitan Area (NFRMA), an area that is in non-attainment of the current ozone standards. Characterizing and modeling air quality in the NFRMA poses large challenges due to the complex terrain and meteorology as well as the mix of diverse pollution source. The comprehensive suite of aircraft and ground-based sampling of meteorological parameters and chemical tracers provides a highly detailed view of the factors impacting air quality in the NFRMA.\nThe focus in this presentation is on episodes during the campaign period when mountain-valley circulation transported pollution from the NFRMA to the pristine mountain areas to the West. We use simulations with the WRF-Chem model together with the field campaign data to examine the pathways and chemical processes that occur during these transport events, use modeled and measured tracers to distinguish the origin, and assess the resulting impacts on the mountain regions.",

            "abstract": "The response of tidal marshes to increasing sea-level rise is uncertain. Tidal marshes can adapt to rising sea levels through vertical accretion and inland migration. Yet tidal marshes are vulnerable to submergence if the rate of sea-level rise exceeds the rate of accretion and if inland migration is limited by natural features or development. We studied how Piermont and Iona Island Marsh, two tidal marshes on the Hudson River, New York, would be affected by sea-level rise of 0.5m, 1m, and 1.5m by 2100. This study was based on the 2011-2012 Coastal New York LiDAR survey. Using GIS we mapped sea-level rise projections accounting for accretion rates and calculated the submerged area of the marsh. Based on the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve Vegetation 2005 dataset, we studied how elevation zones based on vegetation distributions would change. To evaluate the potential for inland migration, we assessed land cover around each marsh using the National Land Cover Database 2011 Land Cover dataset and examined the slope beyond the marsh boundaries. With an accretion rate of 0.29cm/year and 0.5m of sea-level rise by 2100, Piermont Marsh would be mostly unchanged. With 1.5m of sea-level rise, 86% of Piermont Marsh would be flooded. For Iona Island Marsh with an accretion rate of 0.78cm/year, sea-level rise of 0.5m by 2100 would result in a 4% expansion while 1.5m sea-level rise would cause inundation of 17% of the marsh. The results indicate that Piermont and Iona Island Marsh may be able to survive rates of sea-level rise such as 0.5m by 2100 through vertical accretion. At rates of sea-level rise like 1.5m by 2100, vertical accretion cannot match sea-level rise, submerging parts of the marshes. High elevations and steep slopes limit Piermont and Iona Island Marsh’s ability to migrate inland. Understanding the impacts of sea-level rise on Piermont and Iona Island Marsh allows for long-term planning and could motivate marsh conservation programs.",

            "abstract": "The most important factor affecting forest structure and function is the type of management undertaken in forest stands. Owners manage forests using appropriately sized areas to meet management objectives, which include economic return, sustainability, recreation, or esthetic enjoyment. Thus, the socio-environmental unit of study for forests should be the management unit. To study the ecological effects of different kinds of management activities, we must identify individual management units. Road networks, which provide access for human activities, are widely used in managing forests in the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain and Piedmont (SEUS). Our research question in this study is: How can we identify individual forest management units in an entire region? To answer it, we hypothesize that the road network defines management units on the landscape.\nRoad-caused canopy openings are not always captured by satellite sensors, so it is difficult to delineate ecologically relevant patches based only on remote sensing data. We used a reliable, accurate and freely available road network data, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to delineate management units in a section of the SEUS defined by Landsat Wprldwide ",

            "abstract": "Multiyear studies examined meteorologic and hydrogeologic controls on ephemeral streamflow and focused groundwater recharge at 8 sites across arid and semiarid southwestern regions of the US. Intensive data collection targeted the Great Basin, Mojave Desert, Sonoran Desert, Rio Grande Rift, and Colorado Plateau physiographic areas (USGS Prof. Pap. 1703-C). During the study period (1997–2002), the region went from wetter than normal conditions associated with a strong El Niño climatic pattern (1997–1998) to drier than normal conditions associated with a La Niña climatic pattern. The 1997–1998 El Niño, the strongest in the modern instrumental record, roughly doubled precipitation at the Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau study sites. Precipitation at all sites thereafter trended sharply lower, producing moderate- to severe-drought conditions by the end of the study. Streamflow in regional rivers indicated diminishing groundwater recharge, with annual-flow volumes declining to levels of only 10–46% of their respective long-term averages by 2002. Local streamflows showed higher variability, reflecting smaller scales of integration (in time and space) within study-site watersheds. Toward the end of study, extended periods (9–15 months) of zero or negligible flow were observed at half the sites. Summer monsoonal rains generated the majority of streamflow and associated recharge in the Sonoran Desert sites and the more southerly Rio Grande Rift site, whereas winter storms and spring snowmelt dominated the northern and westernmost sites. Proximity to moisture sources and meteorologic fluctuations, in concert with orography, largely control the generation of focused groundwater recharge from ephemeral streamflow, although other aspects (geology, soil, and vegetation) were also identified as factors. Estimates of annual focused infiltration for the research sites ranged from about 105–107 cubic meters from contributing areas that ranged from 26–2,260 square kilometers.",

            "abstract": "Soil microbes catalyze many key ecosystem functions, including soil respiration, and are thus important for understanding global carbon cycles and other biogeochemical cycles. One important component in predicting rates of respiration is determining how microbial communities respond to temperature. A range of models have been developed for determining temperature sensitivity of soil biological activities, most of which are based on the Arrhenius equation. This equation predicts an exponential increase in rate with temperature, despite field and laboratory results suggesting a temperature optimum below the denaturation point. Recently, Schipper et al. (2014) developed a novel theory, Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT), which explains this trend due to heat capacity (CP) changes associated with enzymes. We applied MMRT to respiration data collected using a reciprocal transplant design with soils from three different sites across the U.S. Great Plains to isolate the effects of microbial community type from edaphic factors. We found that MMRT provided a better fit to the data than Arrhenius in 8 out of the 9 soil x inocula combinations. Our analysis revealed that the microbial communities have distinct CP values largely independent of soil type. These results have significant implications for fundamental understanding of microbial enzyme dynamics in soils as well as for ecosystem and global carbon modeling.",

            "abstract": "Arctic Rivers transport vast amounts of terrestrial organic material (TOM) to the Arctic Ocean. The Yenisei River delivers ~18% of total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported to the Arctic Ocean each year during peak river discharge (May-June), known as the spring freshet. Previously published DOC fluxes for the freshet period extrapolate from relatively few data points, due to the uniquely difficult sampling conditions during this dynamic period. Here, we present new high resolution data collected from an extensive sampling campaign from April-July 2014 using a reverse osmosis system for DOC isolation. The similarity between the calculated DOC load delivered during the 2014 freshet (2.94 TgC) and the ten-year average from the previous decade (2.92 TgC for 1999-2008) validates the methodological approach used here. In contrast, the total measured load of polymeric lignin phenols (∑8: 643 Gg), an indicator of TOM input, was one order of magnitude higher than a previously estimated load (42 Gg) for May-June. Hence, we may need to re-evaluate the magnitude of terrestrial carbon exported, including the efficiencies of different sampling methods. Additionally, we present the first simultaneous particulate and dissolved lignin analyses in a major Arctic river. Approximately 30% of the total lignin flux in the Yenisei River is delivered in the particulate phase. Particulate lignin export is decoupled from dissolved lignin during the freshet; the initial flush is dominated by dissolved lignin, while the latter portion of the freshet is dominated by particulate lignin. The chemical signatures of lignin in both phases are similar throughout the freshet, suggesting a mobilization of the same source of carbon each spring. This conclusion is at odds with reported isotopic sources signatures (14C age) of bulk organic matter and lignin in these rivers, requiring a multi-faceted approach to fully understand the sources and ages of terrestrial organic matter in Arctic rivers.",

            "abstract": "In mountain regions, both snowpack trend analyses and modeling studies suggest that streamflow generation is sensitive to loss of snow, yet we still lack understanding of where the most snow-sensitive regions are located. Snow persistence (SP), defined as the fraction of year that an area is snow-covered, is a useful variable for identifying snow-sensitive regions because it is easily observed globally using remote sensing. SP can affect streamflow generation by shifting the timing and magnitude of water input. All other factors being equal, we hypothesize that declining SP decreases the ratio of streamflow to precipitation (runoff ratio), and the magnitude of this effect is greater in arid climates than in humid climates. To evaluate whether streamflow generation declines with decreasing SP, we used the MODSCAG fractional snow cover product and 68 USGS reference catchments across five mountainous regions of the Western U.S. to compute annual and mean annual SP and discharge for water years 2000 to 2011. We used PRISM precipitation to compute the annual and mean annual runoff ratio for each catchment. Results show strong positive relationships between annual SP and annual runoff ratio in the Northern Rockies, Southern Rockies, and Basin and Range, where annual precipitation ranges from 0.25 m at low elevations in the Basin and Range to 2.5 m at high elevations in the Northern Rockies. Mean annual runoff ratios for these regions range from 0.32-0.53, and they also increase with mean annual SP. No relationships between annual SP and runoff ratios are evident in the wetter North Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges, where annual precipitation ranges from 0.44 m in the low elevation Sierras to 4.8 m in the high elevation Cascades. Mean annual runoff ratios for these regions are 0.53-0.87 and show no clear dependence on SP. These results suggest that streamflow generation in arid regions may be most sensitive to loss of persistent winter snow.",

One of the purposes of the Source Physics Experiments (SPE), a series of underground explosive shots at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), is to gain an improved understanding of the generation and propagation of physical signals, such as seismic and infrasound, from the near to far field. Two of the SPE shots (SPE-1 and SPE-4’) were designed to be small “Green’s Function” sources with minimal spall or permanent surface deformation.

            "abstract": "Dynamic climate downscaling experiments are designed to produce information at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. Such additional information is generated from the low-resolution initial and boundary conditions via the predictive power of the physical laws. However, errors and uncertainties in the initial and boundary conditions can be propagated and even amplified to the downscaled simulations. Additionally, the limit of predictability in nonlinear dynamical systems will also damper the information gain, even if the initial and boundary conditions were error-free. Thus it is critical to quantitatively define and measure the amount of information increase from dynamic downscaling experiments, to better understand and appreciate their potentials and limitations.\nWe present a scheme to objectively measure the information gain from such experiments. The scheme is based on information theory, and we argue that if a downscaling experiment is to exhibit value, it has to produce more information than what can be simply inferred from information sources already available. These information sources include the initial and boundary conditions, the coarse resolution model in which the higher-resolution models are embedded, and the same set of physical laws. These existing information sources define an “information threshold” as a function of the spatial and temporal resolution, and this threshold serves as a benchmark to quantify the information gain from the downscaling experiments, or any other approaches. For a downscaling experiment to shown any value, the information has to be above this threshold. A recent NASA-supported downscaling experiment is used as an example to illustrate the application of this scheme.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale patterns of extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability are primarily driven by intrinsic modes of atmospheric circulation variability through changes in surface heat fluxes and ocean currents. While these changes in extratropical SSTs in turn affect the atmospheric circulation, it remains unclear to what extent the oceanic feedback modifies the overall climate variability. The present study focuses on North Pacific variability and revisits this long-standing problem by analyzing multi-century-millennium control simulations of an atmospheric model (CAM4) coupled to the ocean with varying degrees: a 300-yr run of standalone CAM4, 500-year run of CAM4 coupled to a slab ocean (CAM4SOM), and 1300-yr run of fully coupled model (CCSM4). The leading mode of North Pacific atmospheric variability is very similar among three models and resembles the observed Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, in support of the stochastic climate model. In CAM4SOM, the associated surface heat flux anomalies induce SST changes during boreal winter, which tend to persist into the following winter through positive cloud feedback. These SST changes leave weak, but distinct imprints on the atmosphere. The atmospheric response is highly seasonally dependent and projects onto the original PNA pattern in the upper troposphere during boreal winter while a direct baroclinic response becomes prevalent in the other seasons. The thermodynamic air-sea interactions only marginally increase the persistency of PNA variability in CAM4SOM compared to the standalone CAM4 simulation. In CCSM4, a similar influence of extratropical SSTs is suggested but difficult to isolate due to the dominant impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation and associated atmospheric teleconnections. Nevertheless, dynamically-induced SST variability in the oceanic frontal region appears to add more persistency to atmospheric variability because of its low-frequency nature.",

Various studies have demonstrated that the major source of the sporadic Na layer above 100 km is the Na+ within the sporadic E layer in lower E region, where the two share very similar seasonal and local time variations. However, the neutralization process of Na+ above 100 km has not been fully understood due to lack of measurements of both neutral dynamic conditions and the model simulation that can include both dynamics and chemistry.. In this paper, we run the classic sodium model based upon the recent work by Plane et al., (2015) within a simulated lower E region, where both the ion density and the neutral atmosphere are modulated by tidal waves and gravity waves. With the formation of sporadic E layer in this simulation, our results show that the Na density change brought by tide and gravity waves can increase the Na density effectively within the sporadic E layer and the sporadic Na layer can formed above 100 km naturally, which is matched with our USU Na lidar observations.",

Using these images, the bubble number densities (BNDs) were determined, and the decompression rate meter of Toramaru (2006) was used to calculate the decompression rate during the initial explosion of the 2010 Merapi eruption. Calculated decompression rates range from 6.08x10^7 Pa/s to 1.4x10^8 Pa/s. Decompression rates have shown to correlate with eruption column height; therefore Merapi’s rates should be similar to those of other Vulcanian explosions, because the eruption column was 8-9 km in height. The decompression rates acquired for Merapi using Toramaru’s BND meter are higher than the rates calculated with other methods such as microlite number density and extension cracks in crystals. Sakurajima volcano (Japan) experienced decompression rates from 7.0 × 10^3 to 7.8 × 10^4 Pa/s during the later phase of the fall 2011 Vulcanian explosions. Plinian explosions, such as at the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and the 1980 eruption of St. Helens had much higher column heights compared to the initial 2010 Merapi explosion; 35 km, 19 km, and 8-9 km, respectively, but decompression rates in a comparative range (10^8 Pa/s). Higher decompression rates during the 2010 initial explosion at Merapi likely resulted from increased overpressure in the shallow conduit, the release of which was fueled by phreatomagmatic activity resulting from magma interaction with the shallow hydrothermal system.",

            "abstract": "Vortex merger is a phenomenon characterizing the whole class of geophysical vortices, from atmospheric storms and large oceanic eddies up to small scale turbulence. In the ocean, this process takes place at different depths in the water column, involving both surface and subsurface-intensified eddies. We focused on the merger of subsurface isolated eddies in an idealized, full primitive-equations context. This work has been motivated by the evidence of colliding Mediterranean water EDDIES (MEDDIES) off of Gibraltar Strait, as pointed out by several observational and realistic-modeling studies. The critical conditions for merger, like critical merger distance and time needed for merger, were determined. We found that the predictions of classical two-dimensional merger are not verified for subsurface isolated eddies. For instance, critical merger distances will be reduced because of the eddy potential vorticity structure.\nThe choice of a full primitive-equations and three-dimensional context, allowed us to investigate in detail the characteristics of the merged eddy (radius, vertical extension and potential vorticity). The merging process yields slightly shallower, more oblate and energetic eddies, when compared to the initial-state structures.\nMerger-related effects, like production of peripheral filaments and small-scale eddies, were also investigated. These effects confirmed the role of merger in both direct and inverse energy cascades",

            "abstract": "The interannual cooling of the equatorial Pacific associated with La Niña events has been known to cause drought conditions over the southern US by displacing the subtropical jet and storm track northward. Whereas strong El Niños usually terminate after the mature phase, strong La Niñas tend to persist for 2 years or longer, thereby potentially exacerbating the situation. To investigate the impacts of multi-year La Niña events on the extent and persistency of drought in the US, a suite of observational data is analyzed for the past century. Composite analyses based on 10 multi-year La Niña events reveal distinct seasonal evolution of oceanic and atmospheric anomalies during the course of events. During the second year, the peak cooling of the equatorial Pacific weakens while the meridional extent of the cooling is nearly unchanged. Despite the weaker equatorial cooling, precipitation anomalies over the US remain of similar magnitude and the region of reduced precipitation extends further to the north during boreal winter-spring of the second year. These features are robust across different datasets and composite periods. Analysis of atmospheric teleconnections suggests that the reduced meridional gradient of equatorial cooling results in a broader meridional structure of upper tropospheric circulation anomalies, shifting the subtropical jet further to the north. An atmospheric model forced with observed multi-year La Niña SST anomalies shows a similar change in the atmospheric teleconnection patterns from the first to the second year although the difference is much less pronounced compared to observations. Given the sustained impacts on drought, it is crucial to predict the duration of La Niña events in advance.",

            "abstract": "While great progress has been made in reconstructing past sea surface temperatures, reliable bottom water paleotemperature measurements are not routinely available. We suggest that Li/Mg ratios in biogenic aragonites, particularly in the cosmopolitan benthic foraminifer Hoeglundina elegans, have the potential to bridge this gap. Core top calibration shows that H. elegans Li/Mg decreases by 5.5% per °C (r2 = 0.91), with a relationship that is nearly identical to that displayed by a wide range of corals (r2 = 0.95). The fact that such disparate organisms behave so similarly suggests to us that thermodynamics are shining through the ‘vital effects’ that so often plague paleoceanographic proxies. We hypothesize that Ca2+ pumping causes Li/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios in the organisms’ calcification pools to decline, while Li/Mg remains constant. Rayleigh fractionation has the opposite effect on calcification pool Li/Ca and Mg/Ca (they rise), while Li/Mg still remains essentially constant. Hence any environmental influences on Ca2+ pumping and/or Rayleigh fractionation, such as seawater carbonate chemistry, have no measurable effects on aragonite Li/Mg.\nOur first downcore test of the Li/Mg proxy is performed in core KNR166-2-26JPC from 546 m water depth in the Florida Straits. Benthic foraminiferal δ18O was previously used to document decreased seawater density during both Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) and the Younger Dryas (YD), consistent with flattening of isopycnals across the Florida Current caused by slowdown of the AMOC. Here we show striking agreement between H. elegans Li/Mg and ice-volume-corrected δ18O temperatures since ~17 ka (in both absolute values and temporal changes), confirming that bottom waters abruptly warmed during HS1 and the YD. The YD, which is better-resolved, was ~2°C warmer than the Holocene. Li/Mg indicates that Last Glacial Maximum bottom waters were ~2-3°C, or ~5°C colder than during the Holocene. If these glacial temperatures are accurate, they require a similar seawater δ18O to today, which suggests relative freshening in the face of higher mean ocean δ18O. Overall the Li/Mg paleotemperature reproducibility is very good, with a median five-depth running standard deviation of <0.6°C (even before omitting apparent outliers), a number which certainly includes real temporal variability.",

Traditional approaches to using spectral data for studying vegetation have proven effective in sensor-, site-, or plant type-specific settings, but differences in model assumptions and failure to account for uncertainties have hindered efforts to synthesize observations from different sources and use spectral data in a predictive capacity. Here we present a novel approach that uses Bayesian inversion of the PROSPECT 5 leaf radiative transfer model (RTM) to investigate the ability of spectral data to inform our understanding of plant functional traits. First, we validated our method by comparing inversion results to independent measurements of relevant leaf structural and biochemical parameters. Second, we tested the accuracy and precision of RTM parameter retrieval as a function of spectral resolution and quality by performing inversions on simulated observations for a variety of common remote sensing platforms. We observed predictable increases in parameter uncertainty and covariance with declining spectral resolution, but we also found that the measurement characteristics of all sensors are capable of providing information about at least some of the parameters of interest. Finally, we applied our inversion to a large database of field spectra and plant traits spanning tropical, temperate, and boreal forests, agricultural plots, arid shrublands, and tundra to identify dominant sources of variability and characterize trade-offs in plant functional traits. We found substantial intraspecific variability in traits and explored the extent to which this variability falls along the same axes as the interspecific leaf economics spectrum. Ultimately, our results show that Bayesian RTM inversion provides a powerful framework for using spectral data to inform our understanding of plant functional traits and how they are linked with ecosystem processes.",

            "abstract": "Rock friction experiments show that low-velocity fault friction may have a direct and subsequent evolutionary response to changes in slip velocity; the magnitude of which are respectively proportional to parameters a and b in constitutive relations of such rate- and state-dependent friction [e.g., Dieterich 1979; Ruina, 1983]. When a and b are uniform on a fault, translational invariance implies any location is a potential nucleation site, the choice determined by pre-instability conditions and external forcing. With heterogeneous parameters, symmetry is broken, which can create preferred nucleation sites. Recent work showed such heterogeneity does create favorable sites (Ray and Viesca, AGU ’14). Here we study how distributions of (i) relative (0<a/b<1) and (ii) absolute (a-b<0) rate-weakening parameters determine the location of preferred sites. We examine the influence of (i) and (ii) by varying one or varying both (similarly or disparately). The smallest wavelength of variation is comparable to or larger than the size of the developing instability. We consider that elasticity may set either nonlocal (slip between half-spaces) or local (slip below and near a free surface) interactions. We use a dynamical system approach (Viesca, AGU’14) complemented by solutions for slip rate and state evolution during instability development to determine the preferred sites. When (i) varies and (ii) is fixed or varied, an instability develops where relative rate-weakening is locally or globally strongest (a minimum of i) for both types of elastic interactions. This may or may not coincide with the strongest absolute rate-weakening (a minimum of ii). This indicates that parameter (i) is comparatively dominant in deciding the location of a slip instability. However, fixing (i) and varying (ii), we find that elasticity contributes to determining the preferred site: i.e., nucleation occurs at the local minimum and maximum of (ii) for nonlocal and local interactions, respectively. Also, the number of potential nucleation sites increases if the constituent wavelengths of parameter variation are small compared to a characteristic lengthscale for the developing instability. We find that the finite number of densely spaced preferential sites can complicate the prior determination of the location of instability.",

Nowadays, eddy-covariance techniques are deployed in operational mode, sometime in non ideal areas, and footprint analysis is becoming a necessary step to control data quality and to analyse measurements. Following the same way, scintillometers are more and more used by different scientific communities as they offer integrated estimations of surface fluxes with reasonable data processing. This promotes for scintilloters to be good candidates for long term observation of surface fluxes. However, because scintillometers aggregate fluxes over wide areas, it is useful to quantify land cover variability within the scintillometer footprint. More over, it is often an easy way to install transmitter and receiver on high points to avoid high tower design, which leads to varying height of the scintillometer beam above the ground and affect footprint areas. Although large uncertainties may affect data interpretation, very few studies present scintillometer footprints.\nThis study presents the derivation of a footprint function to be applied for large aperture scintillometers. It is based on the Hsieh analytical footprint model, a Gaussian distribution function for transverse wind diffusivity and the path average scintillometer weighting function. It accounts for varying beam height, varying wind direction, and distributed aerodynamical properties along the scintillometer path. Illustrations for both ideal and real setup are presented, together with the impact of stability regime assumptions.",

Accurate cloud ice measurements require good instrument sensitivity to volume scattering and microphysical properties of ice particles, and submillimeter-wave radiometry is a promising technique for this cloud remote sensing. IceCube will demonstrate an 883-GHz receiver technology on 3-U CubeSat to enable accurate cloud ice measurements in future science missions. The IceCube cloud radiometer requires accurate (<2 K) radiometric calibration from a low Earth orbit (LEO) environment similar to the International Space Station (ISS). However, large thermal variations and limited CubeSat resources create great engineering challenges in meeting this requirement. The IceCube team pioneers innovative solutions for calibrating a “free-running” radiometer, using a noise injection circuit to monitor the post-mixer gain, and a spinning CubeSat to acquire the space radiance periodically. In this approach, the mixer gain and its temperature dependence will be characterized from preflight laboratory measurements, while the large post-mixer gain variation will be calibrated from on-flight operation. During the nominal flight operation, to assure the receiver calibration quality, the mixer ambient temperature will be thermally stabilized to 20 ± 2°C with passive paraffin packs. Preliminary testing of the instrument engineering model (EM) is very encouraging, indicating that the proposed calibration approach should work well for a wide range of thermal conditions. The new calibration approach will greatly simplify the system design and radiometric calibration of spaceborne microwave radiometers. More results from instrument TVAC testing will be presented, along with the IceCube operation concept and verification plan of the 883-GHz radiance measurement.

Rapid advances in technology and bioinformatics have led to a better appreciation for the variation in microbial community structure in time and space. Yet, advances in theory are necessary to make sense of these data and allow us to generate unifying hypotheses about the causes and consequences of patterns in microbial biodiversity and what they mean for ecosystem function. Here, I will present a metaanalysis of microbial community assembly from a variety of successional and post-disturbance systems. Our analysis shows various distinct patterns in community assembly, and the potential importance of nutrients and dispersal in shaping microbial community beta diversity in these systems. We also used a trait-based approach to generate hypotheses about the mechanisms driving patterns of microbial community assembly and the implications for function. Our work reveals the importance of rRNA operon copy number as a community aggregated trait in helping to reconcile differences in community dynamics between distinct types of successional and disturbed systems. Specifically, our results demonstrate that decreases in average copy number can be a common feature of communities across various drivers of ecological succession, supporting a transition from an r-selected to a K-selected community. Importantly, our work supports the scaling of the copy number trait over multiple levels of biological organization, from cells to populations and communities, and has implications for both ecology and evolution.

            "abstract": "Several researchers have postulated that, under a changing climate, an intensification of the water cycle is under way. This is usually related to increases in hydrological fluxes such as precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E), and discharge (R). It is under debate, however, whether such observed or reconstructed flux changes are real for West Africa and on what scale. Large-scale increase or decrease of the flux deficit P-E-R, i.e. flux changes that do not compensate, would lead to acceleration or deceleration of water storage potentially visible in GRACE-derived time series. In agreement with earlier studies, we do find accelerations in global maps of gridded GRACE water storage anomalies (Eicker et al., submitted). For sub-Sahel West Africa such accelerations amount up to 7 mm/a2; i.e. statistically significant even seen the short GRACE record. However, W Africa water storage variability is strongly controlled by sea surface temperature and precipitation (Forootan et al., 2014), and interannual/decadal climate variability may mask long-term changes e.g. related to land use change. Yet, here we show that even after isolating and removing a global climate mode in the GRACE data that appears ENSO-related, using a new method, the observed signal over W Africa remains. We can explain this effect only partly with changing surface water levels (Volta reservoir). We then repeat our analysis with flux fields from global atmospheric reanalysis that include land surface models in online (ERA-Interim, CFSR) and off-line (MERRA-Land) mode, and TRMM precipitation data. We find that these fields show surprising skills in reconstructing water storage variability at the monthly timescale when compared to GRACE. In contrast, in particular ERA-Interim falls short in displaying trends that would correspond to GRACE accelerations. We hypothesize this may be due to time-varying biases in the reanalysis-generated fluxes as noticed in other studies. Essentially we conclude that GRACE provides, even though its data record is short, new information that should be used to constrain future regional reanalyses towards a better representation of the water cycle over West Africa.",

The VIIRS geolocation cal/val activities are based on a 15-year heritage dating back to the launch of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). The geolocation accuracy of the VIIRS Reflective Solar Bands (RSB) is based on calibration of I1 red (0.555 µm) radiance while all other bands are registered to the I1 using band-to-band registration (BBR) implemented as part of the pre-launch activities. On-board assessment of BBR is conducted using the moon during monthly lunar maneuvers. While band-to-band registration is reported to have an accuracy of ~40 m, degradation due to sensor thermal variation can occur and a more frequent alternate assessment is needed. The geolocation accuracy of the RSB has been well documented, however the accuracy of the thermal bands has not been quantified. A geolocation error assessment of the VIIRS I5 (11.45 µm) thermal band is presented here. The methodology presented is an adaptation of the visible band approach previously mentioned. While the visible band approach uses Landsat red band based Ground Control Points (GCP) or “chips” that are resampled to VIIRS I1 red band, the thermal approach uses Landsat band 10 (10.89 µm) radiance based “thermal chips” resampled to VIIRS I5 band. The geolocation error is quantified by comparing the VIIRS radiance with simulated Landsat derived VIIRS radiance. Thermal chips can take advantage of data collected in the VIIRS night-time descending orbits however there are limited Landsat night-time data, this results in a mismatch of relative thermal characteristics (i.e. water is warmer than land at night) therefore the daytime and nighttime chips cannot be compared. A novel solution is presented that makes use of an “edge detection” technique eliminating this time-dependence. Results of the analysis illustrate the daily along-scan and –track errors and are compared with SNPP geolocation band-to-band registration.",

            "abstract": "When observing the long-term relationship between atmospheric oxygen and the maximum size in organisms across the Geozoic (~3.8 Ga - present), it appears that as oxygen increases, organism size grows. However, during the Phanerozoic (541 Ma - Present) oxygen levels varied, so we set out to test the hypothesis that oxygen levels drive patterns marine animal body size evolution. Expected decreases in maximum size due to a lack of oxygen do not occur, and instead, body size continues to increase regardless. In the oxygen data, a relatively low atmospheric oxygen percentage can support increasing body size, so our research tries to determine whether lifestyle affects body size in marine organisms. The genera in the data set were organized based on their tiering, motility, and feeding, such as a pelagic, fully-motile, predator. When organisms fill a certain ecological niche to take advantage of resources, they will have certain life modes, rather than randomly selected traits. For example, even in terrestrial environments, large animals have to constantly feed themselves to support their expensive terrestrial lifestyle which involves fairly consistent movement, and the structural support necessary for that movement. Only organisms with access to high energy food sources or large amounts of food can support themselves, and that is before they expend energy elsewhere. Organisms that expend energy frugally when active or have slower metabolisms in comparison to body size have a more efficient lifestyle and are generally able to grow larger, while those who have higher energy demands like predators are limited to comparatively smaller sizes. Therefore, in respect to the fossil record and modern measurements of animals, the metabolism and lifestyle of an organism dictate its body size in general. With this further clarification on the patterns of evolution, it will be easier to observe and understand the reasons for the ecological traits of organisms today.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane (CH4) is the second most anthropogenic greenhouse gas (IPCC, 2013). Observations of methane concentrations at the surface from the last three decades show puzzling fluctuations; from the early 1980s they indicate a nearly constant increase of 8.7 ppbv/year until 2000, including a slowdown after 1990. After a period of about eight years with near zero growh rates, methane concentrations have again been rising since 2007 (Sussmann et al., 2012).\nSimulations forced with prescribed meteorological fields have been performed for the 1980-2010 period using the chemistry-climate model (CCM) SOCOL. 48 methane tracers have been included in SOCOL and used together with flux boundary conditions for CH4 to allow the tracking of methane emissions from different source categories, such as wetlands, rice paddies, ruminants, industry…, as well as geographical regions. These new simulations provide an innovative way to better understand methane variability, both in terms of emission changes and changes in tropospheric OH, which is investigated with a tracer based on methyl chloroform emissions.\nAn analysis of the tracers elucidates the impact of different emission source categories for different time periods. For 1980-1990, positive gobal methane growth rates result from increasing anthropogenic emissions over Europe, India, and China. A decrease of anthropogenic emissions over Europe after 1990 is consistent with the slow down in the global methane growth rate for 1990-2000. During this period short-lived events such as the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and the strong 1997-1998 El-Niño also affect global methane concentrations, largely by a decrease in wetlands emissions during 1992 and high levels of biomass burning in tropical Asia, respectively. The near-zero trend is maintained after 2000 because of reduced natural emissions, again from wetlands. After 2005, our simulations show a positive global methane growth rate, in agreement with the observations, due to the increase of emissions from coal mining in China.",

            "abstract": "Simultaneous-source shooting can help acquire better seismic data with tremendously lower acquisition cost, and thus has attracted much attention from the industry in the past several years. Separation of blended sources into individual sources, also known as deblending, and direct imaging of the blended data, without the need of deblending, are two main ways to deal with the blended data. I review the reported success in the simultaneous-source seismic acquisition together with existing problems that hinder the wide application of this new technique in field. I propose multiple ways to deal with such problems in order to make the simultaneous-source technique easier to use. The new developments include 1) special types of median filters tailored for attenuating the spiky blending noise in the seismic data in order to accelerate the source-separation process; 2) more constraints applied during the inversion process in order to better regularize the under-determined inverse problem; 3) more advanced shot scheduling techniques that make the blended simultaneous-source data easier for separation; 4) more detailed and sophisticated deblending implementations to obtain the optimal source-separation performance; 5) more robust direct imaging algorithms for obtaining artifacts-free seismic images. The new developments are all tested via either complex synthetic examples or field data examples.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring of injected CO2 at the Sleipner carbon storage project is primarily achieved through three-dimensional time-lapse seismic reflection surveys. Previous studies have shown that injected CO2 is trapped in nine distinct thin layers within the reservoir. Whilst seismic reflection images obtained from the time-lapse surveys are adequate to measure changes in lateral extent of these layers through time, measuring the volume of CO2 trapped within each layer has proven difficult. The vertical resolution of the seismic images is only sufficient to directly measure CO2-saturated layers thicker than 8 m, yet the uppermost CO2 layer of the reservoir is thought to be less than 10 m thick. This vertical resolution limit has hindered our understanding of the migration of CO2 through time, both within individual layers and throughout the entire reservoir. Here we present a new method to measure the thickness of thin, CO2-saturated layers by exploiting the repeatability of the time-lapse seismic experiments. Measurements of reflection amplitude from the top of the CO2 layer are combined with measurements of relative changes in two-way-travel-time to the same reflector between surveys to give a unique estimate of CO2 layer thickness. This method is applied to the uppermost layer at Sleipner. Synthetic testing allows quantitative estimates to be made of the uncertainty in the CO2 thickness introduced by noise and uncertainties in the seismic data. By measuring CO2 layer thickness on all time-lapse surveys, temporal changes in the volume of CO2 in the top layer can be calculated. The flux of CO2 into the top layer is observed to be growing at an increasing rate, and the implications for fluid CO2 propagation throughout the reservoir are discussed. The relationship between the thickness of the CO2 layer and the topography of the structural trap for the top layer is also explored.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring phenology with remotely sensed data has become standard practice in large-plot agriculture but remains an area of research in complex terrain. Landsat data (30m) provides a more appropriate spatial resolution to describe such regions but may only capture a few cloud-free images over a growing period. Daily data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite(VIIRS) offer better temporal acquisitions but at coarse spatial resolutions of 250m to 1km. Thus fused data sets are being employed to provide the temporal and spatial resolutions necessary to accurately monitor vegetation phenology. This study focused on Acadia National Park, Maine, attempts to compare green-up from remote sensing and ground observations over varying topography. Three north-south field transects were established in 2013 on parallel mountains. Along these transects, researchers record the leaf out and flowering phenology for thirty plant species biweekly. These in situ spring phenological observations are compared with the dates detected by Landsat 7, Landsat 8, MODIS, and VIIRS observations, both separately and as fused data, to explore the ability of remotely sensed data to capture the subtle variations due to elevation. Daily Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectances(NBAR) from MODIS and VIIRS are fused with Landsat imagery to simulate 30m daily data via the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model(ESTARFM) algorithm. Piecewise logistic functions are fit to the time series to establish spring leaf-out dates. Acadia National Park, a region frequently affected by coastal clouds, is a particularly useful study area as it falls in a Landsat overlap region and thus offers the possibility of acquiring as many as 4 Landsat observations in a 16 day period. With the recent launch of Sentinel 2A, the community will have routine access to such high spatial and temporal data for phenological monitoring.",

The main process involved is suggested through Atmospheric Gravity waves (AGWs) originating from strong convective systems, propagating upward upto the ionospheric heights and perturbing ionospheric parameters (Bishop et al., 2006). We have used ground and satellite data to extract cyclone induced perturbations at different ionospheric heights along with the various parameters of AGWs during cyclones and associated thunderstorm. The initial results suggest that there is increase in total electron content of the ionosphere with wave like signatures in ionosphere. The satellite observation in optical band shows presence of concentric gravity wave pattern associated with troposphere disturbances with horizontal wavelength of ~50-200km and periods ranging from hours to days. The ground based Very Low Frequency (VLF) measurement shows fluctuations in VLF navigational transmitter signal passing over the region of disturbance. The lightning data from GLD360 lightning network shows intense activity associated with cyclones and increase in lightning peak current and energy during main phase of cyclones which seems to be sufficient enough to derive ionospheric disturbances in the ionosphere. This multi-instrument analysis provide detail information of the three dimensional structure of cyclone and their effect at different altitudes of the ionosphere in the Indian subcontinent.",

            "abstract": "Surface ozone is one of the most significant air pollutants due to its damaging effects not only on human health, but also on vegetation and crop productivity. Chronic ozone exposure has been shown to reduce photosynthesis and interfere with gas exchange in plants, which in turn affect the surface energy balance, carbon sink and other biogeochemical fluxes. Ozone damage on vegetation can thus have major ramifications on climate and atmospheric composition, including possible feedbacks onto ozone itself (see figure) that are not well understood. The damage of ozone on crops has been well documented, but a mechanistic understanding is not well established. Here we present several results pertaining to ozone-vegetation interaction. Using the Community Earth System Model, we find that inclusion of ozone damage on plants reduces the global land carbon sink by up to 5%, while simulated ozone is modified by -20 to +4 ppbv depending on the relative importance of competing mechanisms in different regions. We also perform a statistical analysis of multidecadal global datasets of crop yields, agroclimatic variables and ozone exposures to characterize the spatial variability of crop sensitivity to ozone and temperature extremes, specifically accounting for the confounding effect of ozone-temperature covariation. We find that several crops exhibit stronger sensitivity to ozone than found by previous field studies, with a strong anticorrelation between the sensitivity and average ozone levels that reflects biological adaptive ozone resistance. Our results show that a more complete understanding of ozone-vegetation interaction is necessary to derive more realistic future projections of climate, air quality and agricultural production, and thereby to formulate optimal strategies to safeguard public health and food security.",

Extending theoretical results on ensemble averaged cross-spectrum (Liu & Ben-Zion, 2013), we estimate confidence interval for each frequency value using non-overlapping windows with fixed length. The extended theory also connects amplitude and phase errors with error of each spectrum value. Analysis of synthetic stationary ambient noise is used to estimate the confidence intervals for different length of noise data and different frequency content. This method allows estimating Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of noise cross-correlation in frequency domain, without specifying bandwidth, filter parameters or signal/noise windows that are needed for time domain SNR estimations. Synthetic tests are also used to compare the probability distributions and SNR of one-bit normalization or pre-whitening with those obtained by skipping these preprocessing steps. Natural continuous noise records contain both ambient noise and small earthquakes that are inseparable from noise with the existing preprocessing steps. Using probability distributions based on the theoretical results can exclude such small earthquakes (outliers) from continuous noise waveform. We apply this technique to constrain amplitude decay of noise cross-spectra and temporal variations of phase velocity derived from ambient noise cross-correlations, using data from southern California at both regional scale (~ 30 km) and dense linear arrays (~ 20 m) across the San Jacinto Fault Zone.",

Solvation effects were carefully included in our calculations via water-droplet method combined with implicit solvent models (e.g., PCM). The results revealed that, if it is under equilibrium conditions, heavy Si isotopes would be significantly enriched in quartz in comparison to H4SiO4(aq). However, most of the field observations suggested that quartz would have identical or even depleted d30Si values compared to that of H4SiO4(aq). To explain this discrepancy between the equilibrium calculation results and the field observations, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) associated with the formation of amorphous silica, which usually is the precursor of crystalline quartz, was investigated using quantum chemistry methods. The KIE results showed that amorphous silica would be significantly enriched in light Si isotopes during its formation. Our equilibrium fractionation results, however, matched a special type of quartz (i.e., Herkimer “diamond”) very well, due to its nearly equilibrated precipitation condition. Opposite to the case of precipitated quartz, a large equilibrium Si isotope fractionation (i.e., -3.0‰) was found between the absorbed bidentate Si surface complexes (i.e., 2C>Fe2O2Si(OH)2) and H4SiO4(aq). This calculated equilibrium Si isotope fractionation factor largely differed from a previous experimental result (ca. -1.08‰). We found that the formation of transient or temporary surface complexes (e.g., 1V>Fe2OSi(OH)3) may have accounted for the smaller net fractionation observed. With the equilibrium and kinetic Si isotope fractionation factors provided here, the distributions and changes of Si isotope compositions in the Earth’s surface systems can be better understood.",

During the monsoon season, the region experiences wet and dry spells associated with multiple modes of intraseasonal variability.

Based on 60 years of observational data, we will present evidence to show that the characteristics of these wet and dry spells have changed significantly over the historical period. We use targeted single forcing experiments with the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory CM3 coupled model to investigate the separate effect of aerosols and greenhouse gases on the observed long-term trends. The simulations consist of three-member ensemble experiments forced only by time-evolving anthropogenic aerosols, greenhouse gases, and natural forcings, and a five-member experiment with all forcings (natural and anthropogenic). Using these simulations, we show that anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases have had a substantial effect on total rainfall and subseasonal variability during the peak monsoon season, respectively. We will also discuss how increasing aerosols and greenhouse gas concentrations have influenced the wet and dry spell characteristics, and explain the physical mechanisms responsible for such changes.",

Satellite-based lightning data from the GLM has the potential to provide information for convective storms across large territories, including typically data sparse regions such as offshore and within mountainous terrain. Additionally, lightning data may be able to provide extra lead-time over traditional radar data, highlighting which storms are electrically active and growing quickly as opposed to those that are not.\nSince 2010, the Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) has been successfully utilized to provide forecasters with a first-hand look at the latest research concepts and products integrating total lightning data while also educating lightning research scientists on the challenges, needs, and constraints of National Weather Service (NWS) warning forecasters. During the live spring experiments, one to five-minute grids of total lightning density and subsequent lightning-derived algorithms, such as the lightning jump, have been incorporated by NWS forecasters within their real-time warning-decision process for various storm modes over multiple regions of the US. Both formal and informal research protocols were used to collect observations, data, and feedback and included online surveys, live blogging and post-event discussions. In their evaluations, forecasters have noted that total lightning data and algorithms could be an incredibly useful situational awareness tool and may be able to provide additional guidance during a warning decision. Additionally, total lightning data shows promise from a storm safety and aviation forecasting perspective. This presentation will visit the recent history of total lightning use in warning operations as well as current and future plans for implementation, use, and training.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic and remote sensing techniques can now be used to monitor surface deformation associated to the seismic cycle on megathrust. In absence of large interplate earthquake, the measured strain is generally interpreted to reflect elastic deformation of the upper plate related to the pattern of locking, or equivalently ‘interseismic coupling’ of the megathrust. Assessing what fraction of the observed strain is really elastic and available to drive future interplate earthquakes is actually a most difficult problem. It can only be assessed based on an accurate knowledge of the structure and deformation of the upper plate. We will discuss this issue based on observations from the Himalaya and from some oceanic subduction zones. In both contexts, the structure and morphology of the upper plate strongly correlate with the pattern of locking. We infer that a fraction of interseismic strain is actually anelastic. For megathrust with rapid slip rates (>1cm/yr) the assumption that interseismic strain is elastic is probably correct to first order. In any case, the upper plate structure carries information about the megathrust frictional properties and the characteristics of potential interplate earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon, two major metropolitan areas in the Pacific Northwest, are vulnerable to earthquakes on active local faults, deep intraslab earthquakes, and megathrust earthquakes on the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Both cities are located within sedimentary basins that could increase this hazard. The Seattle basin is ~8 km in depth and is located beneath downtown Seattle. The 6-km-deep Tualatin basin (McPhee et al., 2014) sits below and west of downtown Portland with the shallow Portland basin to the northeast. Unlike other West Coast sedimentary basins, the Tualatin contains a higher-velocity Columbia River basalt layer between sediment layers. The velocity contrast between stiff bedrock surrounding the basins and soft sediment within can cause seismic waves to amplify greatly, increasing shaking intensity and duration at the surface. For example, our observations show amplification of seismic waves by factors of 2 - 4 within the Seattle basin. Basin geometry can also increase local shaking by converting incident S-waves to surface waves, and focusing S-waves at basin edges.\nWe characterize effects of the Seattle, Tualatin and Portland basins by modeling with 3-D numerical methods. To evaluate these effects, we use data from the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually, the 2009 M4.5 Kingston, and the 2006 M3.8 Vancouver earthquakes recorded by stations operated by the US Geological Survey (10 - 25 stations) and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (7 - 81 stations). Time differences between S-waves and S-converted-to-P-waves at basin/bedrock interfaces as well as reverberations from teleseisms (global earthquakes) are used to constrain the basin depth and structure of the three basins. Basin effects are modeled using a 3D finite difference program to generate synthetic seismograms. Results will be used to improve the Seattle and Portland 3D velocity models and to better understand and predict amplification of strong motion. We also plan similar analyses to assess the shaking hazards for Portland due to local earthquakes and great earthquakes on the CSZ.",

Using a well characterized occultation technique, the SAGE III instrument’s spectrometer will measure vertical profiles of ozone, aerosols, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, and other trace gases relevant to ozone chemistry. The mission will launch in 2016 aboard a Falcon 9 spacecraft.\nThe primary objective of SAGE III/ISS is to monitor the vertical distribution of aerosols, ozone, and other trace gases in the Earth’s stratosphere and troposphere to enhance our understanding of ozone recovery and climate change processes in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. SAGE III/ISS will provide data necessary to assess the state of the recovery in the distribution of ozone, extend the SAGE III aerosol measurement record that is needed by both climate models and ozone models, and gain further insight into key processes contributing to ozone and aerosol variability. The multi-decadal SAGE ozone and aerosol data sets have undergone intense community scrutiny for accuracy and stability. SAGE ozone data have been used to monitor the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol.\nThe ISS inclined orbit of 51.6 degrees is ideal for SAGE III measurements because the orbit permits solar occultation measurement coverage to approximately +/- 70 degrees of latitude. SAGE III/ISS will make measurements using the solar occultation measurement technique, lunar occultation measurement technique, and the limb scattering measurement technique.\nIn this presentation, we describe the SAGE III/ISS mission, its implementation, the current status of the instrument, and the testing that took place this past summer. We will focus principally on the science to be conducted by the mission.",

            "abstract": "In order to accurately depict glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) of the solid Earth and consequent sea level, it is necessary to incorporate the loading and unloading of the crust occurring over glacial cycles in the form of sediment erosion and deposition. The inclusion of sediment loading in GIA models becomes even more imperative when studying sea level at densely populated centers along coastlines, many of which are located at large river deltas. Sediment deposition at deltas influences sea level by introducing a load, which in turn alters crustal elevation and perturbs the gravitational field. These sediment loads vary in space and time over glacial cycles, as deltas prograde during sea-level highstands and shelves are exposed during lowstands. The Yellow River serves as an archetypical case study of fluvial response to glacial cycles. Draining the highly erodible, glacially derived Loess Plateau, the Yellow River’s sediment flux is the 2nd highest in the world. This site provides an ideal location for modeling sediment loads in order to investigate how glacial cycles control sedimentation history and regional sea level. This study employs datasets constraining deposition and erosion that are physically recorded in dated sediment cores, seismic sections, and river flux measurements. These sedimentary datasets elucidate how loading varies spatially and with time in the basin, but also, importantly, data of fossil-bearing cores act to constrain sea level history during this period. Thus, we utilize physical sedimentary data as both an input to our model and a check on the predicted local sea level. Our gravitationally self-consistent global model is then capable of exploring and constraining how evolving sediment loads and migrating depositional centers impact local predicted crustal deformation, and therefore sea-level, over glacial timescales.",

Next, we incorporate the conditions and location in which the waves occurred into a mathematical model, that in turn is used to provide an accurate simulation.

            "abstract": "This presentation develops a multiscale model to analyze CO2 faulted reservoirs using the STOMP-CO2-R code that is interfaced with the ABAQUS® finite element package. The STOMP-CO2-R/ABAQUS® simulator accounts for the reactive transport of CO2 causing mineral composition changes that modify the geomechanical properties of reservoir rocks and seals. Rocks’ elastic properties that vary during CO2 injection and govern the poroelastic behavior of rocks are modeled by an Eshelby-Mori-Tanka approach implemented in ABAQUS®. A three-dimensional (3D) STOMP-CO2-R model for a reservoir containing an inclined fault is built to analyze a formation containing a reaction network with 5 minerals: albite, anorthite, calcite, kaolinite and quartz. A 3D ABAQUS® finite element mesh that exactly maps the STOMP-CO2-R grid is developed for coupled hydro-geochemical-mechanical analyses. The model contains alternating sandstone and shale layers. The impact of reactive transport of CO2 on the geomechanical properties of reservoir rocks and seals are studied in terms of mineral composition changes that affect the rock stiffness, stress and strain distributions, and pressure margin to fracture (PMF). Simulations assuming extensional and compressional stress regimes with and without coupled geochemistry are developed to study the stress regime effect on the risk of hydraulic fracture. The tendency for the fault to slip is examined in terms of stress regime, geomechanical and geochemical-mechanical effects. The results show that the mineralogical changes due to long-term injection of CO2 reduce the permeability and elastic modulus of the reservoir leading to a reduction of the PMF at and beyond the injection location. Hydraulic fracture and fault slip are not predicted to occur. However, accounting for the geomechemical-mechanical effect in the analysis under the extensional stress regime leads to reduction of the PMF at the injection location and at the seal immediately above this location.",

            "abstract": "It is essential to develop start-up information when conducting long-time climate simulation. In case that the initial condition is already available from the previous simulation of same type model this does not necessary; however, if not, model needs spin-up simulation to have adjusted and balanced initial condition with the model climatology. Otherwise, a severe spin may take several years. Some of model variables such as deep soil temperature fields and temperature in ocean deep layers in initial fields would affect model’s further long-time simulation due to their long residual memories. To investigate the important factor for spin-up simulation in producing an atmospheric initial condition, we had conducted two different spin-up simulations when no atmospheric condition is available from exist datasets. One simulation employed atmospheric global circulation model (AGCM), namely Global Forecast System (GFS) of National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), while the other employed atmosphere-ocean coupled global circulation model (CGCM), namely Climate Forecast System (CFS) of NCEP. Both models share the atmospheric modeling part and only difference is in applying of ocean model coupling, which is conducted by Modular Ocean Model version 4 (MOM4) of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in CFS. During a decade of spin-up simulation, prescribed sea-surface temperature (SST) fields of target year is forced to the GFS daily basis, while CFS digested only first time step ocean condition and freely iterated for the rest of the period. Both models were forced by CO2 condition and solar constant given from the target year. Our analyses of spin-up simulation results indicate that freely conducted interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere is more helpful to produce the initial condition for the target year rather than produced by fixed SST forcing. Since the GFS used prescribed forcing exactly given from the target year, this result is unexpected. The detail analysis will be discussed in this presentation.",

Passive CO2 satellite instruments such as GOSAT and OCO-2 have historically filtered out these scenes, as being too difficult to interpret. However, with the advent of active sensing technologies coupled with ranging capabilities, many of these limitations are being lifted. While, the remote sensing community continues to grapple with the radiative-transfer aspects of the cloud-top CO2 retrieval problem, the carbon cycling community has begun to consider what parts of the carbon cycle might be constrained with this new stream of data. Using cloud data derived from CALIPSO, a simulated carbon cycle, and state of the art atmospheric inversion models, we will investigate the impact of \"above cloud\" partial-column retrievals of CO2 upon estimates of surface CO2 flux. In particular, we will investigate (1) the general constraint imposed upon surface CO2 fluxes, by retrievals over spatially and time coherent cloud structures around the globe as well as (2) the partitioning of gross primary production and respiration CO2 flux terms by differencing full-column and above-cloud partial column CO2 over scenes with optically thick low clouds.",

            "abstract": "Urban growth implies land use changes with natural and agricultural lands becoming urbanized. Hydrological processes in these areas are significantly affected and artificial elements like channels, pipes, streets and other stormwater facilities modify the structure and connectivity of the surface drainage systems. Distributed hydrological modelling of periurban basins requires for an accurate spatial representation to take into account all these features and landscape changes. Classical approaches for terrain representation and drainage network extraction using grids do not necessarily allow considering irregular features and other elements of the complex peri-urban setting, which can also change with time. Thus, a more suitable approach to address these issues is needed. In this work we propose Geo-PUMMA, a set of GIS tools programmed in Python for GRASS that uses irregular meshes to explicitly represent the different components of the peri-urban terrain, particularly the elements affecting the flow paths (i.e. stormwater facilities, channels, streets and pipes). Geo-PUMMA gathers a series of geographical data treatment procedures which use spatial information maps (e.g. cadastral, soil types, geology and digital elevation models) to produce Hydrological Response Units (HRU) and Urban Hydrological Elements (UHEs) that make up a terrain representation more suitable for hydrologic modeling. Geo-PUMMA also allows the extraction of basin morphologic properties such as the width function, the area function and the imperviousness function, which accounts for the impervious contribution located at different distances to the outlet. Geo-Pumma is applied to 2 peri-urban catchments: the Mercier catchment (30% urbanized) located near Lyon, France, and the Estero El Guindo catchment (40% urbanized) located in the Andean piedmont in the Maipo River, Chile. Geo-PUMMA produces a terrain representation that is more representative of the actual drainage structure. Moreover, using the width function and the area function we conclude that Geo-PUMMA improves the drainage network representation particularly at small to medium spatial scales (i.e. 100–400 m for the El Guindo catchment and 50–200 m for the Mercier catchment).",

            "abstract": "Gravitational flux of wave-supported mud flows is a key mechanism in the transport of fine sediment across continental shelves. A better understanding of the physical parameters controlling the resuspension, transport and deposition associated with this process can improve the modeling of sediment from source to sink and the interpretation of the stratigraphic record. The dynamics of wave-supported mud flows is highly complex due to (1) modulation of turbulence by the presence of sediment in a transitional boundary layer, (2) flocculation, erodibility and non-Newtonian behavior of cohesive sediments, and (3) the presence of a small but potentially significant sand fraction. Hence, a fully integrated approach of field observation, laboratory experiments and numerical simulation is necessary. The purpose of this presentation is to provide the most up-to-date synopsis of turbulence-resolving simulations and laboratory observation of wave-supported mud flows, specifically regarding turbulence attenuation by the fine fraction, the role of hindered settling, and turbulence augmentation due to bedforms (anorbital ripples) resulting from a small coarse fraction (coarse silt to fine sand) in the grain-size distribution. New directions integrating lab and field observations of sediment suspension and depositional signatures associated with event evolution are proposed in order to refine the conceptual/phenomenological models of wave-supported mud flows.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting of snowmelt and resultant streamflow in mountainous regions is done operationally using two styles of models: statistical and conceptual simulation models. The former relies entirely on empirically-derived statistical relationships between predictor variables (snow water equivalent, precipitation, etc.) and the target streamflow quantity. The latter, while not explicitly based on empirical statistical relationships, nevertheless has some empiricism built into model components and parameterizations. Both model styles are therefore based to a greater or lesser extent on stable relationships between climate and hydrologic response.\nIn addition, both styles of models rely on repeatable patterns of weather behavior in the future, after the forecast issuance date. For statistical models, future weather is implicit in the fitted model coefficients and the width of the prediction error bounds. For conceptual simulation models, future weather is represented by the ensemble of historical weather traces used to force the model into the future and generate an ensemble of possible streamflow predictions given the current watershed state.\nBoth of these facets of model dependence on climate arouse concern regarding the ability of these models to continue to represent hydrologic response adequately in a rapidly warming climate. Specific susceptibilities include: (1) Earlier disappearance of snowpack, leading to removal of the primary forecast signal; (2) Changes in future weather patterns, leading to changes in snowpack accumulation or increases in variability and persistence, and (3) Changes in fundamental hydrologic input-output behavior.\nThis presentation diagnoses these climate warming vulnerabilities in models used for operational snowmelt-streamflow forecasts, illustrated with specific examples.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic tremor sourced at shallow depths (~ hundreds of meters) is one of the most characteristic seismic signals recorded at active volcanoes and yet to be fully understood. It typically appears preceding many impending volcanic eruptions. However, the origin of this seismic signal remains unclear, which limits our understanding of the sub-surface processes during volcanic unrest. In this study, we propose that the shallow volcanic tremor emerges from pressure oscillations occurring beneath volcanic craters as consequence of continuous degassing. To test this hypothesis, we have coupled a new three-dimensional two-phase flow agent-based model that simulates the bubble dynamics in a magma conduit, a lumped-parameter model for the evolution of the gas pressure beneath the crater, and a lumped-parameter model to simulate the permeable transfer of volcanic gases to the atmosphere. Our numerical experiments reveal that pressure oscillations beneath volcanic craters can explain the main features of shallow volcanic tremor, namely, the direct correlation with gas emissions, the increase of amplitude of the ground vibrations when an eruption approaches, the broadband character of the dominant frequencies (in the range ~ 0.5 - 5 Hz), the frequency gliding towards higher values when the volcanic activity increases, and the power law distribution in the very high-frequency range of the spectra (from the dominant peaks till ~ 10 - 15 Hz). Our model also predicts that the exponent of the power law of the frequency spectra changes systematically with the physical parameters that are thought to vary during the onset of an unrest episode.",

            "abstract": "To have confidence in model predictions of tropospheric pollutants in the Arctic under future conditions, the models need to reproduce current observations. The POLARCAT Model Intercomparison Project (POLMIP) evaluated nine global and two regional models using the observations of the POLARCAT aircraft experiments in 2008, as well as ground-based and satellite observations. These comparisons indicate a significant underestimate of emissions of CO and hydrocarbons in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), as well as large differences between models in OH concentrations and NOy (PAN vs HNO3) partitioning. This presentation will summarize the findings of the POLMIP exercise, as well as evaluations of additional model results for on-going intercomparison activities with several long-term observational datasets. The NOAA/GMD network of surface in situ observations of O3, CO and hydrocarbons provide long records at sites in the Arctic and throughout the NH. FTIR profile or column amounts of CO, C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, and other compounds are available at northern mid-latitude and Arctic sites (e.g., Thule, Eureka, Toronto, etc.) as part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The UC-Irvine Blake group has observed numerous hydrocarbons each season for several decades along the latitudinal extent of the Pacific Ocean, providing a global background record of ethane and propane. These three long-term records are used to evaluate model simulations provided for the IGAC/SPARC Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) and the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP, phase 2), focusing on the model representations of ozone and its precursors in the northern mid and high latitudes. The possible sources of model errors (e.g., emissions, transport and/or chemical processing) will be discussed. Conclusions on what additional measurements (which compounds, where and how frequently) are needed to better constrain and improve global chemistry models will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "We present a holistic Bayesian hierarchical model for reconstructing the continuous and dynamic evolution of relative sea-level change with fully quantified uncertainty. The reconstruction is produced from biological (foraminifera) and geochemical (δ13C) sea-level indicators preserved in dated cores of salt-marsh sediment. The model is comprised of three modules: (1) A Bayesian transfer function for the calibration of foraminifera into tidal elevation, which is flexible enough to formally accommodate additional proxies (in this case bulk-sediment δ13C values). (2) A chronology developed from a Bchron age-depth model. (3) An errors-in-variables integrated Gaussian process (EIV-IGP) model for estimating rates of sea-level change. We illustrate our approach using a case study of Common Era sea-level variability from New Jersey, USA. Results from our new Bayesian transfer function (B-TF), with and without the δ13C proxy, are compared to those from a widely-used weighted-averaging transfer function (WA-TF). The incorporation of secondary proxy information into the model in a formalized way results in smaller vertical uncertainties for reconstructed relative sea level. The vertical uncertainty from the multi proxy B-TF is ~30% smaller on average compared to the WA-TF. We evaluate the performance of both transfer functions by comparing reconstructed relative sea level to historic tide-gauge measurements. The multi proxy B-TF most accurately reconstructs the relative sea-level changes observed in the tide-gauge record. The holistic model provides a single, unifying framework for reconstructing and analysing sea level through time.",

            "abstract": "The Greater Caucasus mountains (GC), which represent the locus of NE-SW directed convergence in the central Arabia-Eurasia collision, are an E-W striking orogen characterized by significant gradients in climate and tectonics. West of 45ºE the GC are a singly-sided, south-directed orogen with a low modern shortening rate of 1-4 mm/yr and a high mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1-2 m/yr. Contrastingly, east of 45ºE, the GC are doubly-vergent, underlain by a subducting slab, shortening at 8-12 mm/yr and have a MAP of 0.1-0.5 m/yr. Despite these significant gradients, the topography of the GC is remarkably similar along-strike, suggesting (1) an eastward increase in erosion rate to balance the shortening gradient, (2) a westward increase in uplift rate to balance the MAP gradient, or (3) similar uplift and erosion rates along-strike independent of the MAP and shortening gradients. We utilize established relationships between catchment scale erosion rates and topography (hillslope gradients and channel steepness) developed elsewhere to assess whether an along-strike gradient in erosion rates is likely in the GC. We combine this with an analysis of the modern GC climate from satellite (TRMM and MODIS) and river discharge data. The relationship between channel steepness and mean hillslope gradient is invariant along-strike. Precipitation variability is positively correlated with elevation and constant along-strike, but runoff variability is low throughout the range and does not vary systematically along-strike. Together these results suggest no significant gradient in erosional efficiency along-strike. Invariant topography and erosional efficiency along-strike could imply similar uplift and erosion rates along-strike, but ultimately require quantitative measures of both to confirm. If erosion and uplift rates are similar along-strike, this requires an additional mechanism to explain the invariant topography despite the strong gradient in modern shortening rate.",

            "abstract": "Pressure-induced spin-pairing transitions in iron-bearing minerals have been in the focus of geophysical studies\n1\n. Modern consensus is that iron spin state in the lower mantle is a complex function of crystal structure, composition, pressure, and temperature. Discontinuities in physical properties of lower mantle minerals have been revealed over the spin transition pressure range, but at room temperature. In this work, we have used a supercontinuum laser source and an intensified CCD camera to probe optical properties of siderite, FeCO3, and post-perovskite, Mg0.9Fe0.1SiO3, across the spin transition in laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Synchronously gating the CCD with the supercontinuum pulses (Fig. 1A) allowed diminishing thermal background to ~8.3*10-4. Utilizing the experimental setup we infer the spin state of ferrous iron in siderite at high pressure and temperature conditions (Fig. 1B). Similar behavior is observed for low spin ferric iron in post-perovskite at 130 GPa indicating that all iron in post-perovskite is high spin at lower mantle conditions. Also, our experimental setup holds promise for measuring radiative thermal conductivity of mantle minerals at relevant mantle conditions.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Seasonally flooded subtropical pastures are major sources of methane (CH4), and periodic flooding drives complex emission dynamics from these ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms of belowground CH4 dynamics driving soil surface fluxes is needed to better understand emissions from these systems and their response to environmental change. We investigated subsurface CH4 dynamics in relation to net surface fluxes using laboratory water table manipulations and compared these results to eddy covariance-measured fluxes to link within-soil CH4 dynamics to observed ecosystem fluxes. Pronounced hysteresis was observed in ecosystem CH4 fluxes during precipitation driven flooding events. This dynamic was replicated in mesocosm experiments, with maximum CH4 fluxes observed during periods of water table recession. Hysteresis dynamics were best explained by oxygen dynamics during precipitation recharge events and the oxidation of CH4 produced in organic soil horizons during water table recession. We observed distinct CH4 dynamics between surface organic and deeper mineral soil horizons. In surface organic soil horizons, high levels of CH4 production were temporally linked to observed surface emissions. In contrast, high concentrations of CH4 observed in deeper mineral soils did not contribute to surface fluxes. Methane production potentials in surface organic soils were orders of magnitude higher than in mineral soils, suggesting that over longer flooding regimes CH4 produced in mineral horizons is unlikely to be a significant component of net surface emissions. Our results demonstrate that distinct CH4 dynamics may be stratified by depth, and flooding of the near-surface organic soils drives the high magnitude CH4 fluxes observed from subtropical pastures. These results suggest that relatively small changes in pasture water table dynamics can drive large changes in net CH4 emissions if surface organic soils remain saturated over longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "The pH of a habitat is essential to an organism’s growth and success in its environment. Although most organisms maintain a neutral internal pH, their environmental pH can vary greatly. However, little research has been done concerning an organism’s environmental pH across a wide range of taxa. We studied pH tolerance in prokaryotes and its relationship with biovolume, taxonomic classification, and ideal temperature. We had three hypotheses: pH and temperature are not correlated; pH tolerance is similar within taxonomic groups; and extremophiles have small cell sizes. To test these hypotheses, we used pH, size, and taxonomic data from The Prokaryotes. We found that the mean optimum external pH was neutral for prokaryotes as a whole and when divided by domain, phylum, and class. Using ANOVA to test for pH within and among group variances, we found that variation of pH in domains, phyla, classes, and families was greater than between them. pH and size did not show much of a correlation, except that the largest and smallest sized prokaryotes had nearly neutral pH. This seems significant because extremophiles need to divert more of their energy from growth to maintain a neutral internal pH. Acidophiles showed a larger range of optimum pH values than alkaliphiles. A similar result was seen with the minimum and maximum pH values of acidophiles and alkaliphiles. While acidophiles were spread out and had some alkaline maximum values, alkaliphiles had smaller ranges, and unlike some acidophiles that had pH minimums close to zero, alkaliphile pH maximums did not go beyond a pH of 12. No statistically significant differences were found between sizes of acidophiles and alkaliphiles. However, optimum temperatures of acidophiles and alkaliphiles did have a statistically significant difference. pH and temperature had a negative correlation. Therefore, pH seems to have a correlation with cell size, temperature, and taxonomy to some extent.",

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured by a newly developed chemical ionization mass spectrometer that uses H3O+ for ionization and a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer for detection (H3O+ CIMS). Results from the measurements will be presented at the meeting. Emission fluxes of VOCs can be determined both by the mass balance and eddy covariance methods. To investigate the potential for eddy covariance flux measurements, we focus on two flights conducted over the Haynesville shale basin on April 4 and April 25, 2015, respectively. Much higher concentrations of biogenic VOCs (isoprene, monoterpenes and methanol) were measured during the flight on April 25, 2015, which provides an opportunity to evaluate our instrument for the eddy covariance technique. Emissions and deposition of various hydrocarbons and oxygenated VOCs are determined and flux divergence derived from flux estimates at different altitudes is used to explore formation and loss processes of organic species in the boundary layer. Based on results from the eddy covariance technique, we will discuss some implications on distribution of emission strength in an oil/gas basin, i.e. what is the relative importance of high versus low emitters to the total emissions. We will also investigate the roles of biogenic emissions in the chemical evolution of oil and gas emissions by comparing the two flights.",

            "abstract": "Operative hydrologic forecast models rely on accurate estimations of initial conditions which are represented by a number of state variables. Filtering-based data assimilation methods have been established as the most widespread alternatives to combine model results with sensor data to better estimate these state vectors. However, current state of the art filtering methods continue to struggle with two difficulties: the adequate balancing of the uncertainties associated with each of the data sources, and the estimation of high-dimensional state variable vectors used by modern distributed land-surface models.\nIn this work we introduce the Pareto Filter, a data assimilation algorithm based on the Particle Filter to address these two challenges. In the first place, this method explicitly formulates the filtering goals—to favor candidate particles whose states are consistent with the observations and with the preceding conditions—in a multi-objective optimization framework to sort the particles in a set of fronts according to a domination ordering. Each front contains a set of mutually non-dominated particles that balance the trade-offs between objectives.\nKernel smoothing is then used on the filtered particles to define a multivariate probability distribution from where states are sampled. Particles are given weights according to the rank of their front, with the highest values assigned to those in the non-dominated Pareto front. This probabilistic perspective helps in reducing the adverse effects of drifting particles and in enabling likelihood computations without the need of assuming a Gaussian distribution. Finally, two optimization algorithms are used to complement the random sampling of candidate states by exploiting the features of high-performing particles in order to accelerate the convergence rate.\nThe proposed Pareto Filter was tested with the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) applied to a real watershed with a state vector of over 30,000 variables. The forecasting accuracy of the model was measured after performing data assimilation using the Pareto Filter and a standard Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filter. The results show a more robust performance by the Pareto Filter and a higher reduction in the uncertainty of the state variable estimates.",

            "abstract": "This study contributes to the understanding of influence of the conductivity perturbations on the ionospheric potential in Earth's global electric circuit (GEC). The conductivity perturbations appearing in middle atmosphere produced by γ-ray bursts from magnetars are studied first. The transient response of the ionospheric potential is modeled in this case and timescales of interest are identified (0.01-10 s). In this case modification of ionospheric potential is small. Additionally, the principal effects of topography and reduction of the conductivity inside the thundercloud are studied. Both of these factors effectively increase the ionospheric potential for a classic source in the GEC represented by a current dipole leading to formation of two main charge centers of the thunderstorm. On the other hand for GEC including topography and conductivity reduction in thunderclouds the contribution of sequence of negative cloud-to-ground lightning discharges to the ionospheric potential is decreased. Simulation results show very good agreement with a simplified approach based on circuit models for conductivity perturbations with horizontal dimensions exceeding 20 km.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate the successful application of cosmogenic He-3 surface exposure dating to construct high-resolution paleoseismic records in the low-potassium Hat Creek basalt. We dated multiple events on the Hat Creek fault, a 47 km-long segmented normal fault at the transition between the Walker Lane and Cascades tectonic provinces. He-3 age dating methods are used to resolve fault slip rate, earthquake timing, and slip-per-event of ground rupturing earthquakes. We are able to separate individual earthquake ruptures using dating of exposed bedrock fault scarps and large fallen blocks. Age and displacement of the lava flow are resolved with high precision and accuracy (+/- 5-10%). The coeval He-3 ages of bedrock fault scarps and toppled blocks, and the occurrence of coeval rock falls on multiple distant fault sections, are both consistent with the hypothesis that earthquake ruptures topple large numbers of blocks near the fault scarp. Thus, the ages of rock fall events can provide the timing of earthquake ruptures. By comparing the timing of ruptures on multiple fault sections, rupture length and regional spatial patterns of strain release can be interpreted.\nHe-3 results on the Hat Creek basalt flow surface (23.8 +/- 1.4 ka; 1SD, N=7) agree with previous Ar-40/Ar-39 ages; however, the cosmogenic exposure age has higher precision. Exposure dating of bedrock fault scarp profiles suggest ages for ground-rupturing earthquakes at 13.1 +/- 1.0 ka and 10.0 +/- 2.4 ka, and a slip-per-event of >2.6-2.9 m. At the same site, dating of toppled megablocks (>2 m in height) and adjacent cliff surfaces suggest exposure ages of scarp-derived rock falls at 12.0 +/- 0.5 (N=2) and 9.1 +/- 1.5 (N=4). Exposure ages of additional rock falls at multiple sites suggest multi-section events at 3.3 +/- 1.1 (N=9) and ~0.2 ka (N=3).\nOur results show that cosmogenic He-3 can be used to reconstruct late Pleistocene to late Holocene earthquakes and fault behavior with age resolution comparable to traditional paleoseismic methods, and represents a novel yet robust dating tool for earthquake hazard analysis in basalt terranes.",

Data is ingested using a custom set of scripts that include the ability to perform basic automated and curated disambiguation. VIVO can display a page for every object ingested, including connections to other objects in the VIVO database. A dataset page, for example, includes the dataset type, time interval, DOI, related publications, and authors. The dataset type field provides a connection to all other datasets of the same type. The author’s page will show, among other information, related datasets and co-authors. Information previously spread across several unconnected databases is now stored in a single location. In addition to VIVO’s default display, the new database can also be queried using SPARQL, a query language for semantic data.\nEarthCollab will also extend the VIVO web application. One such extension is the ability to cross-link separate VIVO instances across institutions, allowing local display of externally curated information. For example, Cornell’s VIVO faculty pages will display UNAVCO’s dataset information and UNAVCO’s VIVO will display Cornell faculty member contact and position information. Additional extensions, including enhanced geospatial capabilities, will be developed following task-centered usability testing.",

For example, electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt can be enhanced or depleted depending on the energy of the particles, and the phase or driver of the storm. In addition, the time scale of the process can vary from minutes to several days. Wave-particle interactions (such as stochastic diffusion or resonant acceleration) are believed to play an important role regulating the dynamics of the particles. However, despite decades of intense theoretical and observational studies, a definitive framework for the wave-particle interactions and the resulting effects in the magnetospheric dynamics remains an open problem. To progress towards a better understanding of the inner magnetosphere dynamics, we need a complete characterization of the electromagnetic fluctuations during storms. Here, using Van Allen Probe magnetic field and relativistic electron observations, we present an statistical study of the relationship between ULF wave power and relativistic electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt during several geomagnetic storms between 2012 and 2015, depending on local time, geocentric distance and storm phase.",

The drill weighs less than 1 kg and can capture a core from a 40 MPa strength rock within a few minutes, with less than 10 Watt power and less than 10 Newton of preload. The PlanetVac is a pneumatic based regolith acquisition system that can capture surface sample in touch-and-go maneuver.\nThese sampling systems were integrated within the footpads of commercial quadcopter for testing.

True climate literacy therefore requires understanding not only the workings of the climate system, but also the current and potential future impacts of climate change and sea level rise on individuals, communities and countries around the world, as noted in the US Global Change Research Program’s (2009) Climate Literacy: The Essential Principles of Climate Sciences. The asymmetric nature of climate change impacts, whereby the world’s poorest countries have done the least to cause the problem but will suffer disproportionate consequences, has also been widely noted. Education in climate literacy therefore requires an element of ethics in addition to physical and social sciences. As if addressing these multiple aspects of climate change were not challenging enough, polling data has repeatedly shown that many members of the public tend to see climate change as a far away problem affecting people remote from them at a point in the future, but not themselves. This perspective is likely shared by many students.\nComputer gaming provides a possible solution to the combined problems of, on the one hand, addressing the multi-faceted nature of climate change, and, on the other hand, making the issue real to students. Fate of the World, a game produced by the company Red Redemption, has been used on several occasions in a small (20-30 students) introductory level general education course on global warming at Weber State University. Players are required to balance difficult decisions about energy investment while managing regional political disputes and attempting to maintain minimum levels of development in the world’s poorer countries. By providing a realistic “total immersion” experience, the game has the potential to make climate change issues more immediate to players, and presents them with the ethical dilemmas inherent in climate change. This presentation reports on the use of Fate of the World in an educational setting, highlighting student experiences and lessons learned from two attempts to use the game as a tool for teaching the multi-faceted nature of climate change.",

The portable tethered ozonesonde system was set up at one of 3 sites located next to a Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment surface monitoring station. The day and site chosen were based on the previous day O3 and weather forecast. Measurements typically began at 8:30 AM and ended at 4:30 PM, averaging 40 profiles in one day. The ozonesonde when sampling at the surface consistently read within 0-3 ppbv of the surface monitor at each of the sites with a typical daytime range of 20-90 ppbv. The hourly values were averaged at 50 meter intervals showing O3 production rates were consistently around 8 ppbv per hour from 50 to 300 meters above ground level. On sunny, light wind days the O3 mixing ratio reached a maximum of 80-90 ppbv between 14:00 and 15:00 local time. The generally constant mixing ratio with height and highest mixing ratios above the surface indicate that photochemical O3 production was taking place throughout the profile. Continuous O3 profiles from a tall tower (5 and 300 m) and daily ozonesondes tracked O3 variability through the experiment. High O3 at each site was associated with different local wind directions. At Ft. Collins winds were generally out of the southeast, at Chatfield from the northeast, and at City Park Golf Course more variable. The tether system was developed at NOAA/ESRL to provide a cost effective method to measure O3 profiles on a continuous basis. The tether system consisted of a deep sea fishing pole, electric motor driving the reel with light-weight fishing line attached to the balloon ozonesonde, a tether control box, and laptop. The in house software package monitored data and controlled the tether speed and turn-around point based on real time GPS altitude from the transmitting radiosonde.",

            "abstract": "The USAID’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) provides seasonal assessments of crop conditions over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) and other food insecure regions. These assessments and current livelihood, nutrition, market conditions and conflicts are used to generate food security scenarios that help national, regional and local decision makers target their resources and mitigate socio-economic losses. Among the various tools that FEWS NET uses is the FAO’s Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI). The WRSI is a simple yet powerful crop assessment model that incorporates current moisture conditions (at the time of the issuance of forecast), precipitation scenarios, potential evapotranspiration and crop parameters to categorize crop conditions into different classes ranging from “failure” to “very good”. The WRSI tool has been shown to have a good agreement with local crop yields in the GHA region. At present, the precipitation scenarios used to drive the WRSI are based on either a climatological forecast (that assigns equal chances of occurrence to all possible scenarios and has no skill over the forecast period) or a sea-surface temperature anomaly based scenario (which at best have skill at the seasonal scale). In both cases, the scenarios fail to capture the skill that can be attained by initial atmospheric conditions (i.e., medium-range weather forecasts). During the middle of a cropping season, when a week or two of poor rains can have a devastating effect, two weeks worth of skillful precipitation forecasts could improve the skill of the crop scenarios. With this working hypothesis, we examine the value of incorporating medium-range weather forecasts in improving the skill of crop scenarios in the GHA region. We use the NCEP’s Global Ensemble Forecast system (GEFS) weather forecasts and examine the skill of crop scenarios generated using the GEFS weather forecasts with respect to the scenarios based solely on the climatological forecast. The period of analysis is from 1985-2010 (over which the reforecasts of GEFS is available) and the focus season is October-November-December. We examine the improvement (if any) in long-term skill, and present results for several recent drought events in the region.",

In order to better protect and preserve this vital natural resource, it is essential to first quantify how much snow exists as a function of both time and space. Unfortunately, existing space-based snow mass (e.g., snow water equivalent [SWE]) estimation algorithms relying on passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperature (Tb) observations can significantly underestimate SWE, particularly in densely-forested regions since forest cover tends to modulate the snow-related portion of the Tb signal as measured from space. Both the overlying vegetation and the overlying atmosphere can attenuate surface microwave emission while simultaneously emitting its own radiation towards the satellite. A Tb decoupling process is explored here via parameterization of atmospheric and forest transmissivity as a function of satellite-derived total precipitable water (TPW) and leaf area index (LAI), respectively. This study also explores the sensitivity of the decoupled multi-frequency, multi-polarization Tb to different LAI retrieval algorithms. Preliminary results suggest the choice of LAI retrieval algorithm significantly affects the efficacy of the Tb decoupling procedure over snow-covered land, and therefore, an accurate representation of LAI as measured from space is integral for improved estimation of regional SWE using space-based passive microwave radiometers.",

ENSO modifies the global distribution of heating by water vapor and raincloud formation in the troposphere, and as such it changes the formation of atmospheric tides that drive prominent structures in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. Here we present an analysis of the atmospheric tides using TIMED/SABER and ionospheric total electron content (TEC) GNNS GPS data throughout 2002-present. The non-migrating tides (DE3 and DE2), their relation to ENSO and their changes with the evolution of this ENSO event will be presented. We will show the impacts of ENSO seen in both the tidal signatures in atmospheric temperatures and the ionospheric response seen in TECs. A comparison to previous ENSO events that have occurred over the past decade will be presented, to provide context for the observed impact of the current El-Niño peak in 2015.",

            "abstract": "While numerical weather prediction models (NWPs) and atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) still treat the surface as blackbody in their longwave radiation scheme, recent studies suggest the need of taking realistic surface spectral emissivity into account, especially for the simulated weather and climate in the polar regions. There is little observation or laboratory measurement available for the surface emissivity in the far IR (<650cm-1). Based on first-principle calculation, we compute the spectral emissivity over the entire longwave spectrum for 11 different surface types. MODIS-retrieved mid-IR surface emissivity at 0.05º by 0.05º spatial resolution is then regressed with the calculated spectral emissivity to determine the surface type for each grid. The derived spectral emissivity data are then spatially averaged onto 0.5º by 0.5º grid boxes and spectrally integrated to the bandwidths used in the RRTMG_LW, a radiation scheme widely used in a variety of AGCM and NWP models. Such band-by-band surface emissivity data are then compared with retrieved surface spectral emissivity from IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) measurement. The comparison shows favorable agreements between two data sets in all the bands covered by the IASI measurements. We further use such data set in conjunction with ECMWF ERA-interim reanalysis to do an off-lien evaluation of the change in OLR and surface upward longwave flux. When the surface spectral emissivity dataset is used instead of blackbody assumption for the entire global surface, the globally averaged difference is ~-1.4 Wm-2 for all-sky OLR and ~-0.9 Wm-2 in clear-sky OLR, and the global mean difference of upward longwave flux at surface is ~-21 Wm-2. Current state-of-the-art GCMs such as NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) makes use of an effective blackbody temperature approach to ensure the upward longwave flux at surface being the same as what the Community Land Model calculates. Comparing to such approach, using the actual spectral emissivity data set leads to a reduction of 0.6 Wm-2 in globally averaged clear-sky OLR and 0.3 Wm-2 in globally averaged all-sky OLR. The regions with largest differences are desert regions and high-latitude oceans and plateaus.",

            "abstract": "In 1959, Kilauea Iki Lava Lake formed as a single pulse of picritic lava ponded in a preexisting crater. The lava cooled and differentiated over the following decades, providing an excellent natural laboratory to study basaltic differentiation. Major element, trace element, and data for numerous isotope systems of both eruption and drill core samples have been previously published. In this study, twelve chalcophile and siderophile elements (V, Ga, Ge, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, W, Tl, and Bi) were measured in sixteen whole rock samples using standard addition solution ICP-MS, which provides high precision data for elements that were previously undetectable. Samples ranging from 26.9 to 2.4 wt% MgO show that all of these elements display incompatible behavior throughout the lake as they increase exponentially with decreasing MgO wt%. Olivine and chromite are the only phases varying significantly in abundance in samples from 27 to 7 wt% MgO. Ferro-diabasic segregation veins and other internal differentiates (5.8 to 2.4 wt% MgO) consist of augite, plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides, and an immiscible Cu-Fe sulfide phase. These veins are significantly more enriched in the listed elements than are the olivine basalts. Several elements (Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Tl) are well correlated with Cu (R2>0.84), which is assumed to be chalcophile in this system. Germanium appears to follow Ti while Ga, In, W, and Bi display incompatible behavior but don’t directly correlate with other elements. Vanadium shows overall incompatible behavior but is depleted in extremely differentiated samples, suggesting it is sequestered in a late stage fractionating phase. Molybdenum, Sb, Tl, and Sn are also very well correlated (R2>0.95) with several incompatible lithophile elements (REE, Ba, Hf, Nb, Ta, Th). This suggests their overall behavior in Kilauea Iki Lava Lake isn’t controlled by any fractionating phase, including sulfides, and they may behave in a more lithophile manner.",

To date, four of the seven planned tests have been conducted, the last in May 2015, called SPE-4P, with a scaled depth of burial of 1549 m/kt1/3 in order to localize the source in time and space. Surface ground motions validated that the source medium did not undergo spallation, and a key experimental objective was achieved where SPE-4P is the closest of all tests in the series to a pure monopole source and will serve as an empirical Green’s function for analysis against other SPE tests. A scientific objective of SPE is to understand mechanisms of rock damage for generating seismic waves, particularly surface and S waves, including prompt damage under compressive stresses and “late-time” damage under tensile stresses. Studies have shown that prompt damage can explain ~75% of the seismic moment for some SPE tests. Spallation is a form of late-time damage and a facilitator of damage mechanisms under tensile stresses including inelastic brittle deformation and shear dilatancy on pre-existing faults or joints. As an empirical Green’s function, SPE-4P allows the study of late-time damage mechanisms on other SPE tests that induce spallation and late-time damage, and I’ll discuss these studies. The importance for nuclear monitoring cannot be overstated because new research shows that damage mechanisms can affect surface wave magnitude Ms more than tectonic release, and are a likely factor related to anomalous mb-Ms behavior for North Korean tests.",

            "abstract": "West of Bridgeport Valley near the Central Sierra Nevada crest, the Little Walker Caldera (LWC) erupted Stanislaus Group lavas and tuffs during the Late Miocene. Remnants of these rocks are now distributed from the western Sierra Nevada foothills across the range and into the Walker Lane. This wide distribution is attributed to the lavas flowing down paleochannels, which provide an excellent marker for deformation over the last 10 Ma. Priest (1978) identified a thick section of these lavas along Flatiron Ridge, the southeast margin of the LWC, which our preliminary data suggests may correlate with lavas in the Sweetwater Mountains to the northeast and at Rancheria Mtn near Hetch Hetchy to the southwest.\nThe oldest unit in the Stanislaus group is the Table Mountain Formation, a trachyandesite. At Priest's measured section it is divided into three members. By our measurements, the Lower Member (Tmtl) is 256 meters thick, has a fine-grained groundmass with plagioclase and augite phenocrysts (<0.5 cm), and the presence of augite phenocrysts distinguishes it from the other members. Some Tmtl flows have chalcedony amigdules. Overlying this, the Large Plagioclase member (Tmtp) is 43.5 meters thick. Distinguished by (~1 cm) plagioclase and occasional small olivine phenocrysts. The Upper Member (Tmtu) is 116 meters thick, very fine-grained and often platy.\nTmtl has a distinctive northwest-oriented normal polarity and geochemistry, similar to several localities at Rancheria Mtn. Tmtu has a reversed polarity similar to the polarity of Table Mountain Formation in the Sweetwater Mountains and lavas that directly underlie the ~9.5 Ma Tollhouse Flat member of the Eureka Valley Tuff at Rancheria Mtn.\nThus, our preliminary data suggest that the lower member at Priest’s Measured Section could correlate to the normal polarity samples at Rancheria Mtn. Also, that the upper Member reversed-polarity samples may correlate with lavas both at the Sweetwater Mountains and Rancheria Mtn. This correlation across about 60 km allows us to assess rotation between sites as well as estimate throw across some faults of the Eastern Sierra range front.",

            "abstract": "Connectivity describes the transport between sediment sources and sinks in fluvial networks, defining source-sink relations in the domains of sediment flux, delivery times, and supplied grain sizes. Connectivity embalms both sediment deliveries to individual reaches and sediment transport regimes on the network scale, and is a central driver behind fluvial biotic and abiotic processes, and related ecosystem services.\nYet, river basin management is missing quantitative tools for studying connectivity in larger fluvial networks. With the CASCADE (Catchment Sediment Connectivity and Delivery) model we recently introduced a framework that quantifies sediment deliveries from each sediment source to all the connected sinks as individual cascading processes. This allows quantifying all domains of sediment connectivity at the reach scale as well as analyzing the resulting network-scale sediment regimes. CASCADE is applicable also for very large and poorly monitored river networks. We implement CASCADE for a large river network (7500 km) in SE Asia and quantify all domains of connectivity for all reaches in the network. We derive some relevant river morphological features for a subset of reaches in the network from high resolution satellite imagery and find significant links between observed forms and sediment connectivity information derived from CASCADE.\nCASCADE opens up novel opportunities to clarify the link between network scale sediment regimes and local morphologic processes and forms. This is of concrete interest for river basin management because CASCADE allows to assess impacts of anthropic disturbance on river sediment regimes and to anticipate resulting changes in local fluvial processes and related eco-system services.",

            "abstract": "Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models are based upon well understood steady state photosynthetic physiology – the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model (FvCB). However, representations of physiological stress and damage have not been successfully integrated into SVAT models. Generally, it has been assumed that plants will strive to conserve water at higher temperatures by reducing stomatal conductance or adjusting osmotic balance, until potentially damaging temperatures and the need for evaporative cooling become more important than water conservation. A key point is that damage is the result of combined stresses: drought leads to stomatal closure, less evaporative cooling, high leaf temperature, less photosynthetic dissipation of absorbed energy, all coupled with high light (photosynthetic photon flux density; PPFD). This leads to excess absorbed energy by Photosystem II (PSII) and results in photoinhibition and damage, neither are included in SVAT models. Current representations of photoinhibition are treated as a function of PPFD, not as a function of constrained photosynthesis under heat or water. Thus, it seems unlikely that current models can predict responses of vegetation to climate variability and change. We propose a dynamic model of damage to Rubisco and RuBP-regeneration that accounts, mechanistically, for the interactions between high temperature, light, and constrained photosynthesis under drought. Further, these predictions are illustrated by key experiments allowing model validation. We also integrated this new framework within the Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-Soil Algorithm (ACASA). Preliminary results show that our approach can be used to predict reasonable photosynthetic dynamics. For instances, a leaf undergoing one day of drought stress will quickly decrease its maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), but it won’t recover to unstressed levels for several days. Consequently, cumulative effect of photoinhibition on photosynthesis can cause a decrease of about 35% of CO2 uptake. As a result, the incorporation of stress and damage into SVAT models could considerably improve our ability to predict global responses to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Effective water resource management typically relies on numerical models to analyze groundwater flow and solute transport processes. Model structural error (due to simplification and/or misrepresentation of the “true” environmental system) and input forcing variability (which commonly arises since some inputs are uncontrolled or estimated with high uncertainty) are ubiquitous in groundwater models. Calibration that overlooks errors in model structure and input data can lead to biased parameter estimates and compromised predictions.\nWe present a fully Bayesian approach for a complete assessment of uncertainty for spatially distributed groundwater models. The approach explicitly recognizes stochastic input and uses data-driven error models based on nonparametric kernel methods to account for model structural error. We employ exploratory data analysis to assist in specifying informative prior for error models to improve identifiability. The inference is facilitated by an efficient sampling algorithm based on DREAM-ZS and a parameter subspace multiple-try strategy to reduce the required number of forward simulations of the groundwater model.\nWe demonstrate the Bayesian approach through a synthetic case study of surface-ground water interaction under changing pumping conditions. It is found that explicit treatment of errors in model structure and input data (groundwater pumping rate) has substantial impact on the posterior distribution of groundwater model parameters. Using error models reduces predictive bias caused by parameter compensation. In addition, input variability increases parametric and predictive uncertainty. The Bayesian approach allows for a comparison among the contributions from various error sources, which could inform future model improvement and data collection efforts on how to best direct resources towards reducing predictive uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Interest in El Niño diversity has increased in the past decade, with much attention given to the hypothesis that El Niño comes in two distinct types: an Eastern-Pacific (EP) El Niño centered off the coast of Peru and a Central-Pacific (CP) El Niño centered near the International Date Line. It is widely believed that the CP type of El Niño has been increasing in frequency in recent decades. However, many findings regarding El Niño diversity are uncertain given the divergence of results from different classification schemes.\nWe test the idea that the CP type of El Niño is a recent and increasingly frequent phenomenon by using the newly released Version 4 of NOAA’s Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures (ERSST v4) dataset with one popular central-location classification method and a new method based on observed spatial patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies. The new method selects an EP and a CP El Niño “end-member” from events that are universally classified one way or the other by preexisting methods and uses pattern correlation with these end-members to sort all El Niño years into EP-dominated, CP-dominated, or mixed influence (M) classes.\nThe advantage of this end-member correlation approach is its simplicity, relying only on observed data without the need for statistical regression, while taking into account a larger portion of the equatorial Pacific than the traditional Niño 3, Niño 4, and related indices. The downside of this approach is the somewhat arbitrary nature of end-member selection, although this is mitigated through the use of transparent selection criteria.\nThe updated ERSST dataset identifies significantly more CP El Niños than two older versions and an independent dataset when using the central-location method. The new pattern correlation method identifies more CP El Niños than EP El Niños for all datasets. The increase in CP El Niño identification in ERSST v4 is linked mostly to differences in the central Pacific in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, although differences between the datasets persist even up to the past two decades. These results underscore the importance of careful selection of El Niño events when studying the difference between EP and CP types of El Niño and the necessity of confirming results with multiple methods and/or datasets.",

Corresponding depths in the Pacific are 0.5±0.2, 1.0±0.3, and 1.9±0.5 km, while depths in the NW Atlantic are 0.7±0.3, 1.6±0.5, and 3.2±1.0 km. The average velocity gradient in Layer 3 is 0.10±0.03 s-1. Sonic log velocities in the basalt sections of Holes 418A, 504B, and 1256D are a near-exact match to Layer 2B; hence, the transition from Layer 2A to Layer 2B generally lies within the lava pile. Sonic log velocities at the top of the dikes in Hole 504B match Later 2C, and the gradient is a good match to the velocity gradient between the top of Layer 2C and the top of Layer 3. Layer 2C thus corresponds to the underlying dikes in Hole 504B and 1256D. On average, the crustal strcuture in the Pacific and NW Atlaintic is consistent with the Penrose lithostratigraphy.",

            "abstract": "Ascraeus Mons is one of the three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis Montes province on Mars. We are conducting geologic mapping of Ascraeus in ArcMap 10.3 at 1:1,000,000 scale using a CTX dataset as a primary basemap. The CTX dataset is supplemented by HRSC, HiRISE, THEMIS, and MOLA data. Our objective is to determine the areal extent, distribution, and age relationships of different lava flow morphologies on the main flank, rift apron, and associated small-vent field of Ascraeus Mons to: (1) identify and understand changes in effusive style across the volcano, and (2) provide insight into martian magma production rates. Our mapping, thus far, at a CTX resolution (~6 m/pixel) shows a variety of effusive styles on the flanks, rift aprons, and plains on and around Ascraeus Mons. Our plan to address (1) is to create a geologic map of Ascraeus Mons. We will use this map to determine where and how different lava flows were emplaced on the flanks and surrounding plains of Ascraeus Mons. We will determine relative ages of units using the emplacement of different geological units, impacts, tectonics, and erosion via superposition relations. We will relate eruptive styles by comparing how different flows are oriented around Ascraeus Mons. Our plan for (2) is to use CTX, MOLA and HRSC datasets to determine volumes of the emplaced lava flows. The volumes will be used to calculate yield strengths and viscosities of each flow. The yield strengths and viscosities will be used to calculate magma production rates. These will prove important to better understand the history and creation of Ascraeus Mons and other volcanoes on other planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt are highly dynamic and respond to impulsive interplanetary structures interacting with Earth’s magnetic field. Two known mechanisms that contribute to the observed dynamics of these electron populations are: Ultralow Frequency (ULF) waves and magnetopause shadowing. The former causes the electrons to change their radial location in order to conserve the quantity associated with the electrons’ azimuthal drift around Earth; the latter describes the process by which these electrons leave Earth’s inner magnetosphere and are lost to interplanetary space. The present work couples the bounce-averaged kinetic Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (CIMI) model to simulate the ring current and radiation belt populations with the Block Adaptive Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) global magnetospheric MHD and ionospheric potential models in order to quantify the radial, azimuthal, and temporal distribution of ULF waves generated by the interaction between impulsive solar wind structures and Earth’s magnetic field. Changes to and losses of relativistic (1-5 MeV) electron populations resulting from the aforementioned mechanisms are investigated.",

            "abstract": "Despite significant advances in our understanding of tropical Indo-Pacific and monsoon climate variability on orbital to millennial timescales, we still know very little about the range and mechanisms of variability in the Southeast Asian monsoon region. To address this need, we have developed a new, decadally-resolved speleothem δ18O and δ13C record from two overlapping stalagmites (TM-17 and TM-8), collected from Tham Mai Cave in Northern Laos. The TM-17 stalagmite was dated with 25 U-Th measurements, which indicate nearly continuous growth since 37.8 ka at ~20 microns/year. Based on 16 U-Th dates, the TM-8 stalagmite grew continuously between 33.7 and 45.6 ka at ~35 microns/year. Both samples were microdrilled at ~0.5 mm resolution and >2000 samples were analysed for stable isotope composition (δ18O and δ13C). Based on cave monitoring work conducted since 2010 and the strong correlation between the overlapping segments of the two records, these two speleothems faithfully record the mean δ18O of rainfall at this site, which reflects an integrated signal of upstream rainout over the Bay of Bengal and tropical Indian Ocean. The composite TM record clearly shows orbital and millennial scale variability over the last 45 kyr, with a strong precessional signal during the Holocene and clear δ18O increases during Heinrich Stadials 1-5, the Younger Dryas, and the 8.2 kyr event. The strong similarity between the Tham Mai record and the Chinese speleothem records supports recent interpretations of these records as reflecting large-scale Indian monsoon intensity rather than local precipitation over East Asia. In contrast to δ18O, speleothem δ13C from Tham Mai Cave may be more reflective of local water balance than large-scale monsoon intensity. The composite δ13C record shows increased values during the Heinrich stadials, especially HS1, potentially reflecting dry conditions with increased prior calcite precipitation and/or decreased soil respiration. Interestingly, the δ13C record shows no change during the Younger Dryas and decreased values during the 8.2 kyr event, suggesting no change and wetter conditions during these periods, respectively. Preliminary trace element data and 14C data will be presented to provide additional evidence for local water balance changes at this site.",

            "abstract": "The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) migrates north--south on seasonal and longer time scales. Previous studies have shown that the zonal-mean ITCZ displacement off the equator is negatively correlated with the energy flux across the equator: When the ITCZ lies in the northern hemisphere, energy flows southward across the equator, and vice versa. The hemisphere that exports energy across the equator is the hemisphere with more net energy input, and it is usually the warmer hemisphere. But states with a double ITCZ straddling the equator also occur, for example, seasonally over the eastern Pacific, and frequently in climate models. Here it is shown how the ITCZ position is connected to the energy balance near the equator in a broad range of circumstances, including states with single and double ITCZs. Taylor expansion of the variation of the meridional energy flux around the equator leads to the conclusion that for large positive net energy input into the equatorial atmosphere, the ITCZ position depends linearly on the cross-equatorial energy flux. For small positive equatorial net energy input, the dependence of the ITCZ position on the cross-equatorial energy flux weakens to the third root. When the equatorial net energy input or its curvature become negative, a bifurcation to double-ITCZ states occurs. Simulations with an idealized aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) confirm the quantitative adequacy of these relations. The results provide a framework for assessing and understanding causes of common climate model biases and for interpreting tropical precipitation changes, such as those evident in records of climates of the past.",

The technique, Local Divergence-Free Fitting (LDFF), can be used to produce maps of a spatial resolution that is determined by the resolution and quality of the observations rather than the fit order. The LDFF technique is described and then applied to observations from an interval during which auroral observations over Alaska were obtained. A detailed comparison is carried out between the high-resolution convection maps and the auroral images. In the interval, Poleward Boundary Intinsifications (PBIs) were observed that developed into auroral streamers and subsequently reached the euqatorward boundary of the main auroral oval. Brightening of the equatorward-most arc and an auroral expansion followed the second streamer reaching the equatorward-arc latitude. The LDFF shows plasma flow in the region of the PBI and streamer with a region of shear across the arcs that propagates with them. The shear precedes (in time) the auroral brightness and diminishes as the brightness decreases. The relationship of the flows to the local field-aligned currents and the larger-scale convection are examined.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology operates a solar Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in Karlsruhe, Germany. TCCON provides precise measurements of column abundances of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, HDO, and H2O from solar absorption spectra recorded in the near infrared spectral domain. The Karlsruhe TCCON spectrometer is an extension over the current TCCON instrumental setup, as a dichroic setup allows to record spectra in the near infrared (NIR) and mid infrared (MIR) spectral domain simultaneously. Measurements in the MIR are performed following the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change - Infrared Working Group Retrieval Parameter guidelines (NDACC-IRWG).\nUnderstanding differences in column abundances from both networks is of high interest for satellite validation using data from both networks yielding a wider spatial and temporal coverage. However, a direct comparison of long-term timeseries retrieved in different wavelength regions is not trivial due to the non-ideal sensitivity of the remote-sensing observation. Different choices of a priori profiles and differing averaging kernels influence the retrieved trace gas columns leading to e.g. a quasi-periodic seasonal bias between data products derived from different spectral regions. Moreover, deficients in spectroscopic parameters might induce additional systematic biases, which might depend on e.g. airmass, humidity or temperature.\nWe present a comparison between column abundances of Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentrations retrieved in the NIR and MIR. We analyse apparent seasonal differences due to differing sensitivities and estimate the bias due to different calibration factors and residual inconsistencies of spectroscopic data. Our study improves the comparability of TCCON and NDACC-IRWG measurements for future CO validations of satellite missions like the Sentinel 5 Precursor mission to be launched in 2016.",

            "abstract": "Records of the sulfur-isotopic composition of sedimentary pyrite have been used to constrain the evolutionary timing of major metabolic pathways, the size of the marine sulfate reservoir, and the redox balance of the planet. It remains a major challenge, however, to explain the enormous range of pyrite δ34S values in the literature and their typical ~10‰ offset relative to sedimentary organic S. We investigate the development of pyrite and organic S records in Santa Barbara Basin, which has suboxic bottom water and high (≥4 wt%) organic matter burial. Concentration and δ34S profiles of major sulfur species (sulfate, sulfide, elemental S, proto-kerogen, pyrite, and extractable organic matter) suggest the occurrence of S-isotope exchange between porewater sulfide and organic S, so we conducted laboratory experiments to test organic S exchangeability with 34S-labelled sulfide–polysulfide solutions. We found that both extractable and proto-kerogen organic matter incorporated significant amounts of label within days, supporting the feasibility of equilibration between sulfide and organic matter in the environment. Unlike organic S, pyrite δ34S values in Santa Barbara Basin sediments are up to 30‰ lower than those for porewater sulfide. We hypothesize that this strongly 34S-depleted pyrite reflects the immediate products of bacterial sulfate reduction at organic-rich structures like microbial biofilms or aggregates and suggest that this δ34S difference between porewater sulfide and pyrite may be a more common than previously recognized. Pyrite δ34S values are not necessarily reflective of porewater sulfide δ34S, suggesting that this common assumption should be revisited. Sedimentary pyrite and organic S are potentially powerful and complementary archives of environmental information. To meaningfully interpret these records, it is essential that we take into account the complex processes affecting sedimentary pyrite and organic sulfur δ34S in modern sediments.",

            "abstract": "Accurately predicting vector-borne diseases is essential for communities everywhere around the world. Yet this is a difficult task, even in areas where annual epidemics occur. The primary vector for dengue virus disease (DENV) is Aedes aegypti. This is a tropical-subtropical mosquito that proliferates in urban areas. Precipitation and increased temperatures are known to promote growth, reproduction and transmission of DENV. This study assesses potential health risks on coastal communities in the northwest Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We studied the relation between DENV incidences and environmental data. We hypothesized that environmental parameters such as rainfall, sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, humidity, and past DENV cases are the primary drivers of DENV incidences. We collected DENV data from the National Health Information System and demographic data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Precipitation and air temperature were obtained from the National Water Commission. SST was derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite sensor. In addition, incidence of DENV cases per year was calculated. Multiple regression analyses show that previous DENV cases, minimum air temperature, humidity, and precipitation are positively related to DENV cases and explain 82% of the variation, with 77% explained by previous DENV cases (cases that took place 2-weeks before the target). A second regression model without the previous DENV cases showed 30% of the variation explained by humidity and precipitation (p<0.05). Satellite-derived SST was also included to test whether the percent variation of DENV explained increased. These results imply that if these environmental variables continue to increase with time, the trend of DENV cases will also increase. This study suggests that it is possible to significantly improve DENV prevention and prediction of potential outcomes in Yucatan using remote sensing data.",

            "abstract": "The 1.5-D Williams et al. model of thermal erosion by turbulent lava was recently applied to the Athabasca Valles lava channel on Mars, in an attempt to establish the importance of thermal erosion in excavating this ~80-100 m deep outflow channel. The modeled erosion depths (0.4-7.5 m) are far less than the depth of the channel which, combined with the short duration of the eruption, suggests that mechanical erosion may have had a greater role. Several studies suggest that mechanical erosion by lava is more important in channel-tube formation than previously thought, under certain circumstances. How would we be able to distinguish between mechanical and thermal erosion? By investigating model results when substrate properties change, as we move from a consolidated, mechanically strong substrate to a partially consolidated or unconsolidated, mechanically weaker substrate. The Proterozoic Raglan komatiitic basalt lava channel of the Cape Smith Belt, New Québec, Canada is a complex erosional environment involving invasive erosion of both sediment and gabbro substrates - which makes it a critical test case. The lava eroded an upper layer of soft sediment, with erosion at the tops, bottoms, and sides of the conduit, through underlying gabbro, and then burrowed laterally into underlying sediment, a scenario requiring a two-dimensional modeling approach. Using the available field data, we will simulate two-dimensional thermomechanical and mechanical erosion interfaces on all sides of a turbulent lava flow by creating a finite-element mesh. The mesh will be defined by the geometry of the lava flow at those lava conduits for which data on lava and substrate composition, lava thickness, slope of the ground, conduit area and volume, and lava flow length are available. Ultimately, this model will be applied to lunar sinuous rilles and martian lava channels for which the use of a two-dimensional approach is needed.",

            "abstract": "With the Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions approaching, and the highly capable instruments of MMS already in orbit, there is an upwelling of interest in understanding plasma turbulence and related effects at kinetic scales. Accordingly a variety of methods have been employed to study kinetic turbulence and in particular dissipation and cascade processes and their effects on protons, electrons and minor ions. Here we discuss the influence of system size, and the completeness and realism of the several kinetic physics models that are employed. One important issue is whether coherent structures such as current sheets can be properly represented and evolved in smaller systems; this is particular important when turbulence is intermittent and non-self similar, so that couplings become nonlocal in scale. Another factor is resolution, both spatial and statistical – what are the effects of counting statistics in PIC and velocity filamentation in Vlasov models? Also discussed is the efficacy and strategic use of models with reduced physics and/or dimensionality – hybrid, Reduced MHD and gyrokinetics, for example. It is suggested, using several example problems, how the cross comparison of models in the context of a framework such as Turbochallenge may have wide ranging conceptual impact.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we report on our ongoing efforts to provide seasonal scale water deficit forecasts in East Africa and the Middle East regions. First, we report on the skill of the seasonal climate forecasts from the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) models over this region. We evaluated deterministic (anomaly correlation), categorical (the equitable threat score) and probabilistic (the ranked probabilistic skill score) skill of the NMME models forecasts over the hindcast period of 1982-2010, focusing on the primary rainy seasons of March-May (MAM), July-September (JAS) and October-December (OND). We also examined the potential predictability of the NMME models using the anomaly correlation between the ensemble mean forecasts from a given model against a single ensemble member of the same model (homogenous predictability) and rest of the models (heterogeneous predictability), and observations (forecast skill). Overall, we found precipitation forecast skill in this region to be sparse and limited (up to three month of lead) to some locations and seasons, and temperature forecast skill to be much more skillful than the precipitation forecast skill. Highest level of skill exists over equatorial East Africa (OND season) and over parts of northern Ethiopia and southern Sudan (JAS season). Categorical and probabilistic forecast skills are also higher in those regions. We found the homogeneous predictability to be greater than the forecast skill indicating potential for forecast skill improvement. In the rest of the presentation we describe implementation and evaluation of a hybrid approach (that combines statistical and dynamical approaches) of downscaling climate forecasts to improve the precipitation forecast skill in this region. For this part of the analysis we mainly focus on two of the NMME models (NASA’s GMAO and NCEP’s CFSv2). Past research on a hybrid approach focusing only over equatorial East Africa has shown promising results. We found that MAM seasonal precipitation forecast skill in this region could be improved by harnessing the recent teleconnection between the precipitation in the region, with the precipitation and SSTs in the Indo-Pacific ocean region.",

            "abstract": "One of the continuing challenges in any Earth science investigation is the amount of time and effort required for data preparation before analysis can begin. Current Earth science data and information systems have their own shortcomings. For example, the current data search systems are designed with the assumption that researchers find data primarily by metadata searches on instrument or geophysical keywords, assuming that users have sufficient knowledge of the domain vocabulary to be able to effectively utilize the search catalogs. These systems lack support for new or interdisciplinary researchers who may be unfamiliar with the domain vocabulary or the breadth of relevant data available. There is clearly a need to innovate and evolve current data and information systems in order to improve data discovery and exploration capabilities to substantially reduce the data preparation time and effort.\nWe assert that Earth science metadata assets are dark resources, information resources that organizations collect, process, and store for regular business or operational activities but fail to utilize for other purposes. The challenge for any organization is to recognize, identify and effectively utilize the dark data stores in their institutional repositories to better serve their stakeholders. NASA Earth science metadata catalogs contain dark resources consisting of structured information, free form descriptions of data and pre-generated images. With the addition of emerging semantic technologies, such catalogs can be fully utilized beyond their original design intent of supporting current search functionality. In this presentation, we will describe our approach of exploiting these information resources to provide novel data discovery and exploration pathways to science and education communities",

            "abstract": "Old, slowly cooled apatites often yield overdispersed helium ages due to factors such as parent zonation, He implantation, radiation damage, crystal defects, and fluid inclusions. Careful mineral selection and many replicate analyses can mitigate the impact of some of these effects. However, this approach adds unnecessary costs in time and resources when dating well-behaved apatites and is generally ineffective at identifying the root cause of age dispersion and providing suitable age corrections for poorly behaved samples.\nWe assess a new technique utilizing static-gas measurement during continuous heating as a means to rapidly screen apatite samples. In about the time required for a conventional total-gas analysis, this method can discriminate between samples showing the volume-diffusion behavior expected for apatite and those showing anomalous release patterns, inconsistent with their use in thermochronologic applications. This method may also have the potential to quantify and discriminate between the radiogenic and extraneous 4He fractions released by a sample. Continuously heated samples that outgas by volume diffusion during a linear heating schedule should produce a characteristic sigmoidal 4He fractional loss profile, with the exact shape and position of these profiles (in loss vs. heating time space) controlled by sample kinetics, grain size, and heating rate. Secondary factors such as sample zoning and alpha-loss distribution have a relatively minor impact on such profiles.\nWell-behaved examples such as the Durango standard and other apatites with good age reproducibility show the expected smooth, sigmoidal gas release with complete exhaustion by temperatures predicted for volume diffusion using typical apatite kinetics (e.g., by ~900˚C for linear heating at 20˚C/minute). In contrast, “bad actor” samples that do not replicate well show significant degrees of helium release deferred to higher temperatures. We report on screening results for a range of samples including a suite of slowly cooled Cretaceous apatites from the Hangay Dome in central Mongolia, assessing the degree to which screening using cumulative heating can reliably identify bad-actor grains, and possibly, correct their ages.",

            "abstract": "This work focuses on documenting the multiscale nature of the spatial coherence of tropical rain, using TRMM satellite-retrieved rainfall observations at multiple space and time resolutions. We take two different approaches, namely, a global and local view. The global view attempts to quantify the conventional view of rain, i.e., the dominance of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), while the local view tries to answer the question: if it rains, how far is the influence felt in zonal and meridional directions? In both approaches, the classical e-folding length for spatial decorrelation is used as a measure of spatial coherence. The major finding in the global view approach is that, at short timescales of accumulation (daily to pentad to even monthly), rain over the Equator shows the most dominant zonal scale. It is only at larger timescales of accumulation (seasonal or annual) that the dominance of ITCZ around 7N is evident. The local view shows the expected dominance of the zonal scale in the tropical ocean convergence zones, with an anisotropy value (ratio of zonal to meridional scales) of 3-4. Over land, on the other hand, the zonal and meridional scales are comparable in magnitude, suggesting that rain tends to be mostly isotropic over continental regions. This latter finding holds true, irrespective of the spatial and temporal resolutions at which rain is observed. Interestingly, the anisotropy over ocean, while invariant with spatial resolution, is found to be a function of temporal resolution: from a value of 3-4 at daily timescale, it decreases to around 1.5-2 at 3-hourly resolution. Finally, we discuss preliminary assessment of the ability of a few models from the suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models, to reproduce some of these aforementioned features.",

            "abstract": "Wetland dynamics is crucial to changes in both atmospheric methane and terrestrial water storage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) highlights the role of wetlands as a key driver of methane (CH4) emission, which is more than one order of magnitude stronger than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas in the centennial time scale. Among the multitude of methane emission sources (hydrates, livestock, rice cultivation, freshwaters, landfills and waste, fossil fuels, biomass burning, termites, geological sources, and soil oxidation), wetlands constitute the largest contributor with the widest uncertainty range of 177-284 Tg(CH4) yr–1 according to the IPCC estimate. Wetlands are highly susceptible to climate change that might lead to wetland collapse. Such wetland destruction would decrease the terrestrial water storage capacity and thus contribute to sea level rise, consequently exacerbating coastal flooding problems. For both methane change and water storage change, wetland dynamics is a crucial factor with the largest uncertainty. Nevertheless, a complete and consistent map of global wetlands still needs to be obtained as the Ramsar Convention calls for a wetlands inventory and impact assessment. We develop a new method for observations of wetland change using Global Navigation Satellite Signals Reflectometry (GNSS-R) signatures for global wetland mapping in synergy with the existing capability, not only as a static inventory but also as a temporal dataset, to advance the capability for monitoring the dynamics of wetland extent relevant to addressing the science issues of CH4 emission change and terrestrial water storage change. We will demonstrate the capability of the new GNSS-R method over a rice field in the Ebro Delta wetland in Spain.",

            "abstract": "High-precision major and volatile element analyses were performed on natural basaltic glass from ODP Leg 192 Sites 1185 and 1187 of the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) as a way to correlate lava flows within and between ODP drill sites. The ultimate goal is to estimate the dimensions, emplacement style, and eruption characteristics of the high-MgO Kroenke-type lavas: the youngest known flows at the two sites. The 122-Ma Ontong Java Plateau is the largest known magmatic event in Earth’s history, yet little is known of the emplacement style (e.g. flow dimensions and durations) of OJP lavas due to its submarine nature and burial beneath hundreds of meters of sediment. Basalt samples were recovered from 110- and 130-m thick core sections from Sites 1185B and 1187A, respectively. Total Kroenke-type lava thickness is 125 m at 1185B and >136 m at 1187. Site 1187A is located 146 km north of Site 1185B and lies ≈50 m shallower than Site 1187. Remarkably, all of the glass compositions from both sites fall on a common liquid line of descent, suggesting that all lavas were the product of a single eruption from a common magma chamber. The range of MgO compositions reflects a 20ºC range in temperature, representing ~1.9% crystallization of olivine + spinel. Using measured phenocryst abundance, we examine whether this crystallization occurred within the magma chamber or during long transport of lavas on the seafloor. More primitive lavas are present in the upper 30 m of Site 1185B (average of ~9.54 wt. % MgO), overlying more fractionated lavas (average of ~9.06 wt. % MgO). Lavas from Site 1187A bridge the gap between the high- and low-MgO groups of 1185B. In contrast to MORB, OJP glasses have no vesicles, suggesting they remained liquid for much longer during flow. Paleoeruption depths calculated from H2O and CO2 contents of glasses show no systematic variation with depth in Core 1185B, and range from ~2130-2650 mbsl, while Site 1187 shows deeper eruption depths of ~2410-3040 mbsl even though the corrected basement depth is ≈50 m shallower. Based on OJP’s 0.3° slope in this area, these depth differences indicate that 1185B flows may have traveled up to 55 km longer than those of 1187. We suggest that lavas flowed for >10s of km after erupting from widely spaced vents of a huge, shallow magma chamber that was compositionally zoned or was recharged over time.",

            "abstract": "Thermoelectric-power generation accounts for more than 70% of the total electricity generation in the United States, which requires large amounts of water for cooling purposes. Water withdrawals for thermoelectric-power generation accounted for 45% of total water use in the United States in 2010. Across the country, water demand from power plants is increasing due to pressures from growing populations and other needs, and is straining existing water resources. Moreover, temperature exceedance in receiving waters has increasingly caused power plants shut downs across parts of the country. Thermoelectric power is vulnerable to climate change owing to the combined effects of lower summer river flows and higher receiving water temperatures. In addition, the efficiency of production is reduced as air temperature rises, which propagates to more unfulfilled power demand during peak seasons. Therefore, a holistic modeling framework of water-energy-climate for the contiguous U.S. is presented here to quantify thermal output from power plants and estimate water use and energy production fluctuations due to ambient climate as well as environmental regulations. The model is calibrated on a plant-by-plant basis for year 2010 and 2011 using the available power plant inventory from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Simulations were carried out for years 2012 and 2013, and results show moderate improvements in capturing thermal output variabilities after calibration. Future power plant operations under scenarios featuring different climate and regulatory settings were investigated. Results demonstrate the interplay among water, energy and climate, and that future changes in climate and socioeconomics significantly affect power plant operations, which may provide insights to climate change mitigation considerations and energy decisions.",

The focus has been to improve laboratory calibration procedures in order to reduce uncertainties, to establish a laboratory uncertainty budget and to upgrade the sensor model to compensate for sensor specific biases.\nThe updated sensor model relies largely on data collected during dedicated characterisation experiments in the APEX calibration home base but includes airborne data as well where the simulation of environmental conditions in the given laboratory setup was not feasible. The additions to the model deal with artefacts caused by environmental changes and electronic features, namely the impact of ambient air pressure changes on the radiometry in combination with dichroic coatings, influences of external air temperatures and consequently instrument baffle temperatures on the radiometry, and electronic anomalies causing radiometric errors in the four shortwave infrared detector readout blocks.\nMany of these resolved issues might be expected to be present in other imaging spectrometers to some degree or in some variation. Consequently, the work clearly shows the difficulties of extending a laboratory-based uncertainty to data collected under in-flight conditions. The results are hence not only of interest to the calibration scientist but also to the spectroscopy end user, in particular when commercial sensor systems are used for data collection and relevant sensor characteristic information tends to be sparse.\nSchaepman, et al, 2015.

This method assumes that the monthly GRACE product is de-aliased, but also that degree-2 terms are obtained from satellite laser ranging solutions. In addition use is made of glacial isostatic adjustment models that take away the rebound effect in the mantle which is seen by both GRACE and SLR. Next an integral equation approach is used to estimate geo-center related geophysical loading, yet, the method is affected by all de-aliasing corrections that are applied to GRACE, including the GIA correction. In our earlier studies we showed that degree and order 1 terms result in a global mass balance of approximately 70 Gt/yr which is around 20% of the ocean signal determined by mass loss. This paper will re-evaluate the definition of the geo-center motion with the help of new GIA models such as ICE-6G and alternative models based on an Earth model that includes lateral heterogeneities. We will focus on the effect of degree 1 terms in the GIA models and the de-aliasing products in relation to sea level change estimates.",

            "abstract": "Schumann in 1952 first predicted the existence of resonances in the Earth-Ionosphere cavity on theoretical grounds. Many studies since then have expanded the theory and determined their basic observational characteristics. Theoretically, the velocity of light divided by the earth's circumference gives 7.5 Hz to a very good approximation. Observations show that the fundamental frequency lies in the range 7 and 8 Hz. These findings define our planetary oscillator. The second oscillator is the human mind that has multiple frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 Hz, which the Electroencephalograph (EEG) can measure. Vethathiri in 1958 developed a systematic approach to reducing mind frequency to Theta (7-4 Hz) and lower. The frequencies of the two oscillators are very close to each other, which can result in entrainment, or the mutual phase locking. This can be the basis for a framework for reprograming the subconscious mind, which is programmed in the Theta and Delta (1-3 Hz) frequencies in the womb and the first six years after birth. Latest findings from Biology (B. Lipton, Biology of Belief, 2005) have shown that 95% of one’s behavior after the age of six is dictated by the subconscious mind. Our proposal is to reprogram the subconscious mind so that a highly materialistic life style may be simplified and the unchecked consumption reduced. Also a mechanistic worldview of the modern science is responsible for a massive exploitation of natural resources and a growing human footprint that is pushing the 21st century towards a civilizational collapse. Through a systematic practice of lowering mind frequencies people would become aware that their existence is interconnected with the whole planet that the indigenous cultures believed and practiced. Universities may introduce the framework presented here in their undergraduate sustainability curricula that would greatly aid in reversing the current trend.",

At the introductory course level, students are required to use the educational resources offered by the AMS—specifically their weather and climate studies materials, which have recently transitioned to a digital format. The Earth Sciences Program at CalUPA recently incorporated these new digital resources into a climatology course with novel pedagogical variants. These teaching strategies were well received by students and may benefit other climatology courses at similar institutions. For example, students were tasked with expounding upon textbook content from ‘Topic In Depth’ segments; they were required to present tangential climate topics in a digital presentation. Moreover, students mined the scientific literature listed at the end of each chapter in the text to identify climate scientists immersed in social media. Students were then required to follow these scientists and engage each other within a social media platform. Finally, as a culminating experience, students were required to create digital portfolios (e.g., infographic) related to climate science and the AMS materials. This presentation will further detail CalUPA’s climatological course offerings and detail how the AMS resources were connected to course requirements listed herein.",

            "abstract": "There are a variety of sources of geological data that suggest major variations in the volume and extent of the Antarctic ice sheet during the early to middle Miocene. Simulating such variability using coupled climate-ice sheet models is problematic due to a strong hysteresis effect caused by height-mass balance feedback and albedo feedback. This results in limited retreat of the ice sheet once it has reached the continental size, as likely occurred prior to the Miocene. Proxy records suggest a relatively narrow range of atmospheric CO2 during the early to middle Miocene, which exacerbates this problem. We use a new climate forcing which accounts for ice sheet-climate feedbacks through an asynchronous GCM-RCM coupling, which is able to better resolve the narrow Antarctic ablation zone in warm climate simulations. When combined with recently suggested mechanisms for retreat into subglacial basins due to ice shelf hydrofracture and ice cliff failure, we are able to simulate large-scale variability of the Antarctic ice sheet in the Miocene. This variability is equivalent to a seawater oxygen isotope signal of ~0.5 ‰, or a sea level equivalent change of ~35 m, for a range of atmospheric CO2 between 280 – 500 ppm.",

ESD was anticipated during dust storm/devil on Mars. A model estimated that ESD generated oxidants can be 200 times of those produced by photochemistry.\nOur study is conducted in three steps. Firstly, oxychlorine salts, NaClOy, Mg(ClO4)2.xH2O (x=0,6), and Ca(ClO4)2.xH2O (x=0,4), were analyzed at ambient conditions using MIR, NIR (1.4-2.6 µm), Raman spectroscopy, and in a Mars Chamber using in-situ NIR and Raman spectroscopy. Our purpose is to understand their phase transition and spectral change at Mars pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions. We have found: (1) Under current surface/subsurface P-T conditions in mid-latitudes/equatorial regions on Mars, Mg(ClO4)2.6H2O and Ca(ClO4)2.4H2O are stable, while the hydration degree of NaClO4.H2O would increase at T<-30℃ and decrease in 5<T<21℃with dehydration rate increases at higher T; (2) Within the P-T range anticipated in above environments, Raman ν1 peak positions of hydrous and anhydrous oxychlorine species have no obvious change, but H2O peak would down-shift when T decreases; (3) In Mars 2020 and ExoMars, the Raman ν1 peak can be used to characterize oxychlorine salts, e.g., the oxidation degree changes from Cl+ to Cl7+ in NaClOy- that causes over 243 cm-1 shift, the cation changes from Na+ to Mg2+ to Ca2+ that cause over 33 cm-1 shift; (4) The dehydration of NaClO4.H2O was quantified by in situ NIR spectroscopy, based on which the dehydration rate as function of T was derived.\nWe are currently conducting ESD in a Mars Chamber, to detect the oxidant species in ESD generated plasma, first in pure CO2 atmosphere then in simulated Mars gas mixture. Results will be reported at conference. Our step-3 will study the production/yield from chlorides mixed with Mars-relevant materials to oxychlorine salts through ESD process.",

            "abstract": "Due to its use as a stabilizer for chlorinated solvents, 1,4-dioxane (1,4D), a probable human carcinogen, is a common co-contaminant in solvent spills at industrial and military sites and landfills. Its persistence in large groundwater plumes at low concentrations makes it a relevant candidate for in-situ bioremediation via cometabolism. Microcosm studies are being performed to evaluate the capability of aerobic microorganisms to cometabolize mixtures of 1,4D and chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1TCA), and 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1DCE), with isobutane as the primary substrate. Microcosms were constructed using aquifer solids from Fort Carson, Colorado, a site contaminated with 1,4D and TCE, to assess the isobutane uptake and transformation of 1,4D and chlorinated solvents by microorganisms native to the site. Additional microcosms were augmented with Rhodococcus rhodochrous, a bacterium shown to cometabolize 1,4D and chlorinated solvents. Results indicate that native microcosms cometabolized 1,4D upon stimulation with isobutane after a lag period of about 15 days. TCE was also transformed, but at significantly slower rates. The presence of 1,4D and TCE at 500 and 300 ppb, respectively, did not inhibit the growth of native microorganisms on isobutane, with isobutane uptake and 1,4D transformation occurring simultaneously. Bioaugmented microcosms transformed 1,4D immediately after inoculation with R. rhodochrous. Tests in bioaugmented microorganisms indicated that the presence of TCE at low concentrations inhibits but does not block the transformation of 1,4D. Results from the microcosms will be used to design field tests to be performed at Fort Carson. Additional microcosm studies will compare the stimulation of native and bioaugmented microcosms and the transformation of mixtures of 1,4D, 1,1,1TCA and 1,1DCE. Molecular methods will analyze the monoxygenase enzymes expressed in the native and bioaugmented microcosms.",

            "abstract": "Wavelet analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) successfully identifies degraded fault scarps where earthquakes produce topographic steps and provides an estimate of their morphologic age. However, these methods may fail to detect relatively young, sloping scarps created by more gently-dipping normal faults, misidentifying them as mature, highly-degraded vertical scarps if they are detected at all. We present new wavelet templates incorporating initial scarp slope and above- and below-scarp surface angles to better describe the curvature of observed fault scarps. These templates are based on an analytic solution for scarp curvature, allowing for more accurate estimation of the relative age of the scarp.\nSynthetic tests show that scarp-like landforms that went largely undetected by a vertical-scarp template are more clearly detected using profile geometries that reflect subtle changes in curvature due to scarp and far-field slope angles. Analysis of DEMs from sites in Surprise Valley in the northwestern Basin and Range and near Jenny Lake on the Teton rangefront illustrates the effects of along-strike variability in scarp morphology on best-fit template parameters. Where normal fault scarps have high slopes, they are identified by filters designed to detect topographic step functions. Scarps with finite initial slopes, as well as those that cut surfaces with different angles above and below the scarp, can be resolved with higher signal-to-noise ratios using more sophisticated template functions. Adaptive use of different wavelet templates could reduce the number of false negatives in wavelet analysis of data from complex faulting regimes, improving the robustness of these methods and enabling automated fault mapping of large areas.",

            "abstract": "Clearing of tropical forests, which includes semi-permanent conversion of forests to other land uses (deforestation) and more temporary forest disturbances, is a significant source of carbon emissions. The previous estimates of tropical forest carbon loss vary among studies due to the differences in definitions, methodologies and data inputs. The best currently available satellite-derived datasets, such as a 30-m forest cover loss map by Hansen et al. (2013), may be used to produce methodologically consistent carbon loss estimates for the entire tropical region, but forest cover loss area derived from maps is biased due to classification errors. In this study we produced an unbiased estimate of forest cover loss area from a validation sample, as suggested by good practice recommendations. Stratified random sampling was implemented with forest carbon stock strata defined based on Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness (Potapov et al., 2008) and forest cover loss (Hansen et al., 2013). The largest difference between the sample-based and Hansen et al. (2013) forest loss area estimates occurred in humid tropical Africa. This result supports the earlier finding (Tyukavina et al., 2013) that Landsat-based forest cover loss maps may significantly underestimate loss area in regions with small-scale forest dynamics while performing well in regions with large industrial forest clearing, such as Brazil and Indonesia (where differences between sample-based and map estimates were within 10%). To produce final carbon loss estimates, sample-based forest loss area estimates for each stratum were related to GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass (Baccini et al., 2012). Our sample-based results distinguish gross losses of aboveground carbon from natural forests (0.59 PgC/yr), which include primary, mature secondary forests and natural woodlands, and from managed forests (0.43 PgC/yr), which include plantations, agroforestry systems and areas of subsistence agriculture. Latin America has the highest proportion of aboveground carbon loss coming from natural forest clearing (72%) among the continents. The total (above- and belowground) annual carbon loss from forest disturbances in the tropics is estimated to be 1.3 PgC/yr, which accounts for 13% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions (IPCC 2014).",

            "abstract": "A large and growing body of research over the last decade and a half has applied weak temperature gradient (WTG) theory to understand the dynamics of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Following from this recent literature, this talk will first describe the development of novel process-oriented MJO diagnostics based on WTG assumptions that can be used to diagnose the dominant processes responsible for MJO destabilization, propagation, and initiation. These diagnostics make use of the synoptic-scale balance of diabatic heating by adiabatic cooling in the tropics under small Coriolis force, which holds extremely well on MJO timescales. Next, these diagnostics will be applied to the ERA-I reanalysis dataset and several models including the superparameterized CCSM (SP-CCSM), NCAR CESM, and regional convection-permitting simulations for the November 2011 MJO event during the DYNAMO field campaign. We will show through examination of column moistening processes associated with condensation and vertical moisture advection that radiative feedbacks are necessary for understanding MJO destabilization in both reanalysis datasets and SP-CCSM. Interestingly, these diagnostics also show that horizontal moisture advection in SP-CCSM appears necessary for understanding the tilted horizontal moisture structures in the model, which traditionally have been thought to be primarily due to shallow convective moistening. Finally, diagnostics of column processes from SP-CCSM and NCAR CESM will be contrasted, and provide insight into why SP-CCSM produces a robust MJO, while the CESM does not.",

As the part of precipitation which remains after evaporation is available on land, their difference, P-E can be considered as a measure of water availability. Even though reanalysis data sets provide values for precipitation and evaporation, the inconsistency between different reanalysis data sets on their values in the study region makes it unreliable for modeling purposes. The P-E values were therefore computed from the atmospheric moisture budget, and on estimating the correlation coefficients, they were found to be more consistent across the different reanalysis data sets used (MERRA, ERA Interim and CFSRR). The P-E values from CFSRR highly disagree with the other two data sets, which was remarkably improved when derived from atmospheric budget. Improved satellite data like GRACE and CERES were also used to understand the surface moisture budget and energy budget of the region. The P-E values from atmospheric budget were compared with the divergence of latent energy flux from energy budget to check its accuracy. The closure of surface moisture budget however weakened on using the atmospheric budget derived values of P-E. Nevertheless, an improved consistency between different reanalysis data sets on P-E values will help in a better modeling of the monsoon over South Asia.",

Nevertheless, the 2012 National Research Council report, Discipline-based Education Research: Understanding and Improving Learning in Undergraduate Science and Engineering suggests that the geosciences lag behind other science disciplines in the integration of education research within the discipline and the establishment of a broad research base.\nIn January 2015, early career researchers from earth, atmospheric, ocean, and polar sciences and geoscience education research (GER) gathered for the ENGAGE workshop. The primary goal of ENGAGE was to broaden awareness of discipline-based research in the geosciences and catalyze relationships and understanding between these groups of scientists. An organizing committee of geoscientists and GERs designed a two-day workshop with a variety of activities to engage participants in the establishment of a shared understanding of education research and the development of project ideas through collaborative teams. Thirty-three participants were selected from over 100 applicants, based on disciplinary diversity and demonstrated interest in geoscience education research. Invited speakers and panelists also provided examples of successful cross-disciplinary collaborations. As a result of this workshop, participants indicated that they gained new perspectives on geoscience education and research, networked outside of their discipline, and are likely to increase their involvement in geoscience education research. In fact, 26 of 28 participants indicated they are now better prepared to enter into cross-disciplinary collaborations within the next year. The workshop evaluation revealed that the physical scientists particularly valued opportunities for informal networking and collaborative work developing geoscience education research projects. Meanwhile, GERs valued opportunities to discuss the boundaries of outreach, evaluation, and research and the potential next steps to advance geoscience education. Recommendations from the workshop are well aligned with earlier reports, and along with those documents, contributes to a path forward for geoscience education.",

The main objective of this study is to determine how groundwater flux variations in the source zone can affect NAPL dissolution dynamics. In particular, we develop interplays among groundwater flux variations, NAPL aqueous concentration, NAPL CMD and other source strength dynamics. The developed analytical models can capture a wide range of NAPL source zone dynamics encountered in real-world applications. The results demonstrate the significance of groundwater flux variations in influencing the NAPL source dynamics. If groundwater flux decreases with time, the CMD declines initially at higher rate but the rate decreases at later stages. On the other hand, when groundwater flux increases with time, the NAPL CMD exhibits a slower decline initially and faster decrease at later stage. When groundwater flux in the source zone increases with time, the reduction in CMD (CMDR) increases slower than the NAPL mass reduction (MR), leading to a concave downward CMDR versus MR curve. If groundwater flux decreases with time, the CMDR versus MR curve is convex upward. When the groundwater flux does not change with time, CMDR versus MR follows a 1:1 linear relationship.",

            "abstract": "Presence of ice in soil would reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff. Field studies in local-scale open areas showed that soil infiltration capacity is normally reduced due to the presence of ice. However, many filed studies showed that there are weak or no clear effects of frozen soil on infiltration and runoff generation especially in forested areas at large scales. Many land surface models (LSMs) for use in large scale Earth System Models show that explicitly including soil ice in LSMs degrades the simulation of runoff in cold regions.\nIn this talk, I will present the current status of representations of soil water phase change and its thermal effects in LSMs and more specifically on a parameterization scheme for infiltration under frozen soil conditions for large-scale applications guided by runoff observations. This scheme computes vertical water fluxes by introducing the concept of a fractional permeable area (of a model grid), resulting in schemes for computing matric potential and saturated hydraulic conductivity under presence of ice. The scheme produced favorable simulations of runoff and terrestrial water storages (TWS) when compared with observed discharge and monthly TWS derived from gravity signals of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. This scheme is now adopted by some major LSMs for weather predictions and climate projections.",

            "abstract": "Present Tsunami warning issuance largely depends on an event’s predicted wave height and inundation depth. Specifically, a warning is issued if the on-shore wave height is greater than 1m. This project examines whether any consideration should be given to current velocity. We apply the idea of force balance to determine theoretical minimum velocity thresholds for injuring people and damaging properties as a function of wave height. Results show that even at a water depth of less than 1m, a current velocity of 2 m/s is enough to pose a threat to humans and cause potential damage to cars and houses. Next, we employ a 1-dimensional shallow water model to simulate Tsunamis with various amplitudes and an assumed wavelength of 250km. This allows for the profiling of current velocity and wave height behavior as the Tsunamis reach shore. We compare this data against our theoretical thresholds to see if any real world scenarios would be dangerous to people and properties. We conclude that for such Tsunamis, the present warning criteria are effective at protecting people against larger events with amplitude greater than ~0.3m. However, for events with amplitude less than ~0.2m, it is possible to have waves less than 1m with current velocity high enough to endanger humans. Thus, the inclusion of current velocity data would help the present Tsunami warning criteria become more robust and efficient, especially for smaller Tsunami events.",

            "abstract": "The potential release of carbon from thawing permafrost peatlands is a major global change uncertainty. In addition to releasing old carbon from permafrost, thaw can also induce changes in hydrology that affect the aboveground plant community, leading to changes in litter quality and organic matter degradability. Stordalen Mire is a peat plateau in northern Sweden where permafrost thaw has led to land subsidence and inundation, causing dry palsas with intact permafrost to be replaced by Sphagnum-dominated bogs followed by sedge-dominated fens. In this study, we examined trends in solid phase peat humification along this permafrost thaw succession using a combination of C/N ratios and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. C/N ratios decreased with depth in all sites except fens, likely due to N immobilization during decomposition. In fens, depth trends in C/N ratios were complicated by the presence of Sphagnum-derived peat at depth. However, %N (by weight) at all sites was positively correlated with peat humification indices (HI), which indicate the degree of decomposition and are defined based on FTIR spectra as the ratios of absorbance at wavenumbers 1515, 1630, 2850, and 2920 cm−1 (aromatics and aliphatics) to the absorbance at 1030 cm−1 (polysaccharides). Each of these HI was inversely related to the prevalence of the carboxylic acid peak at 1720 cm−1, and this trend became weaker along the permafrost thaw gradient. This result suggests that decomposition at the early thaw stages is inhibited by organic acids, but this effect becomes less significant as thaw-induced plant succession leads to lower acidity. All of these trends in HI were strongest for the HI defined at 1630 and 1515 cm−1 (representing aromatics), indicating that peat humification at Stordalen is primarily characterized by relative increases in aromatic compounds compared to carbohydrates, with less pronounced relative increases in lipids and other aliphatics (2850 and 2920 cm−1).",

            "abstract": "High-resolution active-source seismic imaging in heavily urbanized regions is problematic because equipment deployment is often constrained to linear roadways, where access for active seismic sources may be limited and seismic energy from ambient urban noise can overpower active sources. To investigate the application of linear-array seismic interferometry for obtaining subsurface images in the upper 1 km beneath an urban area, we acquired passive seismic data along two roadways that cross a northern segment of the Seattle fault zone, Washington State. Both of the profiles were collocated with previously acquired active-source reflection lines, which we used as control for interpretations. The interferometry profiles were roughly 1 km in length and were acquired using 8-Hz resonant frequency, vertical-component geophones that were deployed at 5 m spacing (nominally 216 sensors). Approximately 24 hours of data were acquired on each profile over four days (because of permitting and security issues, the equipment could not be deployed overnight). The basic processing sequence used to create virtual source gathers (VSG’s) included pre-correlation gain correction, resampling, bandpass filtering, correlation by cross coherence, and VSG editing. After editing, around 18% of the individual virtual sources were retained for further analysis. VSG’s were then dip filtered prior to stacking to further mitigate coherent noise. Our VSG’s resolve 4-30 Hz Rayleigh waves, propagating at 300-600 m/s, and at least one diving P-wave propagating at roughly 1800 m/s. These apparent velocities are similar to those of comparable wave phases observed in the active-source data. Overall, these newly acquired high-resolution seismic imaging data provide insights into seismic velocity of the upper 1 km across the Seattle fault zone.",

            "abstract": "The Opportunity Rover is in its 11th year of exploration, currently exploring the Cape Tribulation rim segment of the ~22 km wide Noachian Endeavour Crater and its tilted and fractured outcrops. A key target for Opportunity’s measurements has been the Spirit of Saint Louis crater (SoSL), which is ~25 m wide, oval in plan view, shallow, flat-floored, and has a slightly raised rim. SoSL crater is surrounded by an apron of bright, polygonally-shaped outcrops and is superimposed on a gentle swale in Cape Tribulation. Rocks in a thin reddish zone on the rim are enriched in hematite, Si, and Ge, and depleted in Fe, relative to surrounding rocks. Apron rocks include an outcrop also enriched in Si and Ge, and slightly depleted in Fe. In general rocks in the crater and apron have elevated S levels relative to Shoemaker formation breccias, tracking values observed in the Cook Haven (gentle swale superimposed on Murray Ridge and site of Opportunity’s 5th winter site) and the Hueytown fracture (running perpendicular to Cape Tribulation) outcrops. SoSL crater lies just to the west of Marathon Valley, a key target for exploration by Opportunity because five separate CRISM observations indicate the presence of Fe/Mg smectites on the upper valley floor. Opportunity data show that low relief, relatively bright, wind-scoured outcrops dominate the valley floor where not covered by scree and soil shed from surrounding walls. Initial reconnaissance shows that the outcrops are breccias with compositions similar to the typical SoSL crater apron and floor rocks, although only the very upper portion of the valley has been explored as of August 2015. Pervasive but modest aqueous alteration of Endeavour’s rim is implied by the combination of CRISM and Opportunity data, providing insight into early aqueous processes dominated in this location by relatively low water to rock ratios, and at least in part associated with enhanced fluid flow along fractures.",

We separate the finite-element integration into a discretization-specific portion and discretization-independent pointwise functions associated with the governing equations. The discretization-specific portion is designed to accommodate arbitrary order finite elements and multiple implementations for optimization targeting specific hardware (e.g., CPU and GPU). The pointwise functions encapsulate the physics, including the governing equations and rheologies. Users can easily extend the code by adding new pointwise functions to implement different rheologies and/or governing equations. PyLith currently includes pointwise functions for quasi-static and dynamic elasticity for several elastic, viscoelastic, and elastoplastic rheologies. We plan to add pointwise functions for coupling of elasticity with fluid flow and incompressible elasticity.

            "abstract": "New gravity data refine the basin structure beneath the city of Napa, California and suggest continuity of the West Napa fault to the SE, near the city of Vallejo. Previous regional gravity data defined a basin 2-3 km deep beneath Napa where the 2014 M6.0 South Napa and the 2000 M4.9 Yountville earthquakes caused considerable damage. Higher ground motions were also recorded within the area of the gravity low. About 100 new gravity measurements sharpen gravity gradients along the eastern margin of the gravity low, where there was a concentration of red-tagged buildings from the 2014 earthquake. The new data also confirm the presence of an intrabasinal, arch, defined by slightly higher gravity values (~ 1 mGal) in the center of the basin and marked by the edge of a significant magnetic high (~150 nT). This arch coincides with the highest concentration of red-tagged buildings from the 2014 earthquake. Comparison of the potential-field anomalies with rock types encountered in water wells suggests that the arch is underlain by sediments which thin to the south where they are underlain by thick Sonoma Volcanics.. We speculate that the concentration of damage may be caused by shallowing of the basement or by a thicker sequence of basin sediments in the arch or both.\nRed-tagged buildings from the Yountville earthquake are near the western edge of the basin defined by significant potential-field gradients of the West Napa fault. A sharp basin boundary or guided waves along the fault may have contributed to concentration of damage in this area. Although the potential-field gradients decrease south of Napa, our new gravity data define a gradient aligned to the SE beneath the town of Vallejo. The gradient resides within Mesozoic basement rocks because it traverses outcrops of Great Valley Sequence. Although these data cannot prove Quaternary slip on this structure, its trend and location may indicate continuation of the West Napa fault to the SE.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing body of observational and modeling evidence that Arctic Amplification (AA) might strongly impact both the weather and climate, not only in the Arctic region, but also remotely in Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. However, discrepancies in atmospheric circulation response exist among different model integrations. \nTo investigate the robust circulation response in both the troposphere and stratosphere, we make use of a dry primitive equation model with a simple representation of the stratospheric polar vortex. We have found that, with an imposed AA forcing, the tropospheric jet shifts equatorward and the stratospheric polar vortex weakens, which is in good agreement with previous studies. Despite the weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex, we have found no statistically significant change in the frequency of sudden stratospheric warming events. Furthermore, in order to quantitatively assess the role of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, we isolate the tropospheric pathway by nudging the stratospheric zonal mean state towards the reference state. With the nudging method and thus an inactive stratosphere, in response to AA, the tropospheric jet is still found to shift equatorward, but by only about half the magnitude compared to that of an active stratosphere. The difference represents the stratospheric pathway and the downward influence from the stratosphere on the troposphere. This suggests that stratosphere-troposphere coupling plays a non-negligible role in establishing the midlatitude circulation response to AA.",

However, the connection between physical processes occurring deep within the magnetosphere and external interplanetary drivers it is not yet well understood. In this work we investigate whether a selected set of interplanetary structures affect the local time distribution of three different classes of high energy electron pitch angle distributions (PADs), namely normal, isotropic, and butterfly. We split this work into two parts: initially we focus on the methodology used which employs a Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM) neural network for identifying different classes of electron PAD shapes in the Van Allen Probes’ Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT) data. The algorithm can categorize the input data into an arbitrary number of classes from which three of them appears the most: normal, isotropic and butterfly. Other classes which are related with these three also emerge and deserve to be addressed in detail in future works. We also discuss the uncertainties of the algorithm. Then, we move to the second part where we describe in details the criteria used for selecting the interplanetary events, and also try to investigate the relation between key parameters characterizing such interplanetary structures and the local time distributions of electron PAD shapes.",

            "abstract": "Over 30 dropsonde transects were performed across atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the eastern Pacific during CalWater 2015. An event in late January allowed first-of-its-kind coordinated dropsonde transects of an AR using the NOAA G-IV aircraft in tandem with the NOAA Ronald H. Brown (RHB), which observed the marine boundary layer during the passage of this major AR. Dropsonde data collected on 22 January 2015 sampled the early stages of the AR, when the AR began making landfall near Vancouver Island, British Columbia. At the same time the RHB collected precipitation and oceanic moisture flux measurements on the warm side of the AR. A second flight on 24 January 2015 sampled the later stages of the AR, again passing over the RHB stationed beneath the AR. During this later period, the AR axis of moisture shifted north-northeast and fanned out along the coast, affecting regions from Northern Washington to Southern Alaska. Multi-day landfalling AR conditions led to flooding in British Columbia and northern Washington. The influence of the coastal orography combined with the shift in AR orientation is examined to understand the orographic control of precipitation that triggered the flooding. In addition, cross section analysis of the AR using dropsonde and reanalysis data are used to better understand the synoptic influences, water vapor transport, and moisture evolution during the lifecycle of the AR. To gain greater insight into AR development and prolonged AR conditions that led to enhanced flooding, a comparison of aircraft and ship data from CalWater 2015 and NOAA Unique CrIS/ATMS Processing System (NUCAPS) retrievals (integrated water vapor, vertical temperature and moisture profiles, and an experimental ATMS-only rain rate product) will be compared for the 22-24 January period.",

However, how to produce optimal rainfall estimation for a given region is still challenging due to the spatial and temporal sampling difference of different sensors. In this study, we develop a data fusion mechanism to improve regional quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) by utilizing satellite-based CMORPH product, ground radar measurements, as well as numerical model simulations.\nThe CMORPH global precipitation product is essentially derived based on retrievals from passive microwave measurements and infrared observations onboard satellites (Joyce et al. 2004). The fine spatial-temporal resolution of 0.05o Lat/Lon and 30-min is appropriate for regional hydrologic and climate studies. However, it is inadequate for localized hydrometeorological applications such as urban flash flood forecasting. Via fusion of the Regional CMORPH product and local precipitation sensors, the high-resolution QPE performance can be improved. The area of interest is the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex, which is the largest land-locked metropolitan area in the U.S. In addition to an NWS dual-polarization S-band WSR-88DP radar (i.e., KFWS radar), DFW hosts the high-resolution dual-polarization X-band radar network developed by the center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA).\nThis talk will present a general framework of precipitation data fusion based on satellite and ground observations. The detailed prototype architecture of using regional rainfall instruments to improve regional CMORPH precipitation product via multi-scale fusion techniques will also be discussed. Particularly, the temporal and spatial fusion algorithms developed for the DFW Metroplex will be described, which utilizes CMORPH product, S-band WSR-88DP, and X-band CASA radar measurements. In order to investigate the uncertainties associated with each individual product and demonstrate the precipitation data fusion performance, both individual and fused QPE products are evaluated using rainfall measurements from a disdrometer and gauge network.",

Although some of these glaciers, such as Jakobshavn Isbrae, have continued to retreat, others have re-stabilized in a new terminus configuration. This study investigates the terminus behavior of Helheim and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers, southeast Greenland, since their terminus positions re-stabilized in 2006, roughly 4 km upstream of their 2001 positions. (Glacier velocities have remained elevated since 2001.) We combine satellite measurements of ice-front position, glacier velocity, and surface elevation from 2008-2015. We find significant variability in terminus position and glacier velocity over this time period, with changes in terminus position of more than 3 km and changes in glacier velocity of more than 3 km/yr at both glaciers. At Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, glacier velocity and terminus position varied seasonally, with glacier advance and slowdown typically commencing in December/January and glacier retreat and speedup typically commencing in July/August. The seasonal retreat occurred through the calving of large tabular icebergs, likely indicating the disintegration of a seasonal ice tongue similar to that observed at Jakobshavn Isbrae. In contrast, at Helheim Glacier, iceberg calving events and glacier retreat occurred at all times of the year.

            "abstract": "The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission (MAVEN), launched on November 18, 2013, is now in its primary science phase. The mission was designed to study the upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere of Mars, the response to solar and solar-wind input, and the ability of atmospheric molecules and atoms to escape to space. In this study, we use a time-dependent MHD model to interpret plasma observations made by MAVEN particle and field instruments. Detailed comparisons between the model and the relevant plasma observations from MAVEN are presented for an entire Mars rotation under relatively quiet solar wind conditions. Through comparison along MAVEN orbits, we find that the time-dependent multi-species single-fluid MHD model is able to reproduce the main features of the plasma environment around Mars. Using the model results, we find that photoionization beyond the terminator is the dominant ion source as compared with day-night transport in maintaining the nightside ionosphere. Model results also show that both the time-varying solar wind conditions and the continuously rotating crustal field work together to control the ion escape variation with time.",

Ancient carbonate chemistry, which is intimately related to oceanic pH and atmospheric pCO2, remains particularly uncertain, despite its importance for understanding environments and temperatures on early Earth. Using a new application of high-precision calcium isotope measurements, we present data from the Tumbiana Formation (2.7 Ga, Western Australia), the Campbellrand Platform (2.6 Ga, South Africa) and the Pethei Group (1.9 Ga, Northwest Territories, Canada) that allow us to place constraints on carbonate chemistry both before and after the Great Oxidation Event. By analogy with calcium isotope behavior in sulfate minerals (Blättler and Higgins, 2014) and Mono Lake (Nielsen and DePaolo, 2013), we infer a lower limit on the ratio of calcium ions to carbonate alkalinity during deposition of these three sedimentary sequences. These data rule out the soda ocean hypothesis (Kempe and Degens, 1985) and make further predictions about the role of CO2 in solving the faint young Sun problem.",

The MISE instrument is designed to enable the identification and mapping of organics, salts, acid hydrates, water ice phases, altered silicates, and radiolytic compounds at global (≤ 10 km), regional (≤ 300 m), and local scales (~ 25 m). Mapping the composition of specific landforms is critical to understanding surface and subsurface geologic processes, including recent or current activity. High spatial resolution compositional mapping is also essential for detecting small outcrops of organics and salts. Distribution maps of astrobiologically relevant compounds and their geologic context can be used to assess whether Europa’s ocean is capable of supporting life. MISE could provide fundamental information on where future Europa landers would have the highest probability of detecting evidence of life.\nThe MISE instrument design is for a high-optical throughput pushbroom imaging spectrometer that could observe effectively throughout a flyby or in orbit around Europa. MISE would cover a spectral range from 0.8–5 μm at 10 nm/channel, with an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 250 μrad/pixel and a swath width of 300 active pixels. The 0.8–2.5 μm region is essential for quantifying hydrates and bulk surface composition, while the 3–5 μm region is required for detecting low abundances of organics, most radiolytic products, and discriminating salts from acid hydrates. These longer wavelengths can also be used to measure thermal emissions from currently active regions. MISE is designed to operate within Europa’s challenging radiation environment and deal with both radiation noise and total integrated dose. The MISE design is the result of collaboration between NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (California Institute of Technology) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (John Hopkins’ University).",

            "abstract": "In 1964, E.H. Hammond proposed a set of criteria for the classification and mapping of physiographic regions of the United States. He used extensive, field-acquired knowledge of slope, local relief, and profile type to produce a map entitled “Classes of land surface form in the forty-eight States, USA”, regarded as a pioneering and rigorous treatment of regional physiography. With the advent of computer processing and the availability of digital elevation models (DEMs), several researchers have since developed digital landform modeling approaches to map the distribution of physiographic regions. Many of these approaches incorporate Hammond-based or Hammond-modified algorithms for the small study areas. However, these approaches have been criticized as incomplete by failing to consider slope, relief, and profile type in combination.\nWe propose a new algorithm to map Hammond landforms using 250 m DEM data which faithfully incorporates slope, relative relief and profile type parameters, and uses spatial analysis to characterize each of these elements. We applied the algorithm to a global 250 m DEM to create a new global Hammond’s landforms map. We compare the new Hammond landforms with other global landform maps and assess alignment (visual) with a global hillshade terrain dataset. We comment on the potential uses of these data (e.g. mapping ecosystem distributions) and discuss important distinctions between physiographic regions (e.g. tablelands) and discrete landform types (e.g. mountains).",

Day to day changes in this information introduce uncertainty in retrievals. As an example, biomass burning events substantially enhance the NO2 concentration in usually clean regions, causing an underestimation of the NO2 columns due to an incorrect NO2 profile. Similarly, AMFs for pixels surrounding a city will vary day to day as the winds shift, leading to potential underestimation of the plume downwind of the city, with consequences for estimates of NO2 lifetime calculated from these plumes. Building upon the existing BErkeley High Resolution (BEHR) NO2 retrieval, we have implemented daily a priori NO2 profiles to the retrieval algorithm for several test cases and will demonstrate the quantitative effect of these daily profiles on the retrieved NO2 columns.",

            "abstract": "The development of new visualization techniques and the use of complex-rheology fluids open a new area for planetary geodynamic modelling, as observations of surface patterns (i.e. faults, folds, ridges, trenches) can be related to convective instabilities inside the laboratory mantle analog. The rheology of colloidal aqueous dispersions of silica nanoparticles depends strongly on the solid particle fraction, φp, deforming in the Newtonian regime at low φp, and transitioning to strain-rate weakening, plasticity, elasticity, and brittle properties as φp increases. So, as the system is dried from above, a dense skin grows on the surface, akin to a planetary lithosphere. If it is also heated from below, hot plumes develop.\nWhen a hot plume impinges under the skin, it triggers a new mode of subduction: as the upwelling plume material breaks the lithosphere and flows above the denser skin, it forces it to sink. The subduction trenches are localized along the rim of the plumes and strong roll-back is observed. Subduction always occurs along partial circles, a situation very different from the purely viscous case. This is due to the brittle character of the upper part of the experimental lithosphere: it cannot deform viscously to accommodate roll-back and sinking motions. Instead, the plate tears, as a sheet of paper would do upon intrusion. The experiments further suggest that a weaker lithosphere than that present on Earth today is required for such a convective regime.\nThese experimental observations strongly resemble the association of large coronae with trenches that is observed on Venus. The surface deformation structures and the subsurface density variations predicted by the laboratory agree with radar image observations and subsurface density variations inferred from modeling the gravity and topography data at Artemis and Quetzelpetlatl Coronae. Evidence for geologically recent volcanism at Quetzelpetlatl suggests that subduction may be currently active on Venus.",

            "abstract": "The annual probability of an asteroid impact is low, but over time, such catastrophic events are inevitable. Interest in assessing the impact consequences has led us to develop a physics-based framework to seamlessly simulate the event from entry to impact, including air and water shock propagation and wave generation. The non-linear effects are simulated using the hydrodynamics code GEODYN. As effects propagate outward, they become a wave source for the linear-elastic-wave propagation code, WPP/WWP. The GEODYN-WPP/WWP coupling is based on the structured adaptive-mesh-refinement infrastructure, SAMRAI, and has been used in FEMA table-top exercises conducted in 2013 and 2014, and more recently, the 2015 Planetary Defense Conference exercise. Results from these simulations provide an estimate of onshore effects and can inform more sophisticated inundation models. The capabilities of this methodology are illustrated by providing results for different impact locations, and an exploration of asteroid size on the waves arriving at the shoreline of area cities. We constructed the maximum and minimum envelops of water-wave heights given the size of the asteroid and the location of the impact along the risk corridor. Such profiles can inform emergency response and disaster-mitigation efforts, and may be used for design of maritime protection or assessment of risk to shoreline structures of interest.

Forecasts of streamflow and water supply rely heavily on snow measurements from sparse observation networks that may not provide adequate information during abnormal climatic conditions. Satellite observations of snow covered area are available globally and in near real-time. In this regard, we have developed a method to estimate snow depth from remotely-sensed images of snow covered area by considering the snow holding capacity of the terrain. We show that the relationship between basin-wide average snow depth, as interpolated from snow surveys, and Landsat TM/ETM+-derived basin snow covered area yields an r2 of 0.64 and 0.68 in two alpine basins of different climatologies in California and Colorado, respectively. Regression analyses that use fractional snow covered as the independent variable to estimate snow depth from a high resolution Lidar survey result in relative mean squared errors between 39% and 58% of measured snow depth for different roughness classifications near the date of peak accumulation. Future work will look at the changes in the relationship between snow depth and snow covered area through the ablation season to determine the relationship’s utility to water supply forecasting. The importance of this work is illustrated through examples that estimate snow depths for select alpine regions globally.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater is critical to sustaining all life on Earth yet most humans take this resource for granted and often consider it a free good. However, in water-poor areas, the availability of clean drinking water limits economic development, negatively impacts human health and causes significant social instability. This was a driver for the Millennium Development Goals to include providing clean water to the developing world. Unlike other resources, another commodity cannot be substituted for water. In mineral resources, substitution is common depending on the use, for example, aluminum for steel in automotive bodies. In energy, humans can, in some instances, use natural gas instead of coal for electricity generation. Given the critical nature of freshwater for human existence, it is important that the resource be evaluated in economic terms. Although efforts to assess the value of the availability of freshwater have been developed, they are not commonly used. Water quality is also a major economic factor in availability of water resources. Quality can be prohibitively expensive to bring to acceptable standards and can easily be contaminated by human activities. Determining an economic and social value on both the availability and quality of water resources is a challenge that the hydrologic community must address at local, regional and national and even global scales to support informed policy and decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Uranium plume persistence in groundwater aquifers is a problem on several former ore processing sites on floodplains in the upper Colorado River Basin. Earlier observations by our group and others at the Old Rifle Site, CO, have noted that U concentrations are highest in organic rich, fine-grained, and, therefore, diffusion limited sediment material. Due to the constantly evolving depositional environments of floodplains, surficial organic matter may become buried at various stages of decomposition, through sudden events such as overbank flooding and through the slower progression of river meandering. This creates a discontinuous subsurface distribution of organic-rich sediments, which are hotspots for microbial activity and thereby central to the subsurface cycling of contaminants (e.g. U) and biologically relevant elements (e.g. C, N, P, Fe). However, the organic matter itself is poorly characterized. Consequently, little is known about its relevance in driving biogeochemical processes that control U fate and transport in the subsurface.\nIn an investigation of soil/sediment cores from five former uranium ore processing sites on floodplains distributed across the Upper Colorado River Basin we confirmed consistent co-enrichment of U with organic-rich layers in all profiles. However, using C K-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with Fourier-Transformed Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance Mass-Spectroscopy (FT-ICR-MS) on bulk sediments and density-separated organic matter fractions, we did not detect any chemical difference in the organic rich sediments compared to the surrounding coarser-grained aquifer material within the same profile, even though there were differences in organic matter composition between the 5 sites. This suggests that U retention and reduction to U(IV) is independent of C chemical composition on the bulk scale. Instead it appears to be the abundance of organic matter in combination with a limited O2 supply in the fine-grained material that stimulate anaerobic microbial processes responsible for U enrichment. Thus, the chemical composition of organic matter is subordinate to the physical environment and total organic matter content in controlling U reduction and retention processes.",

            "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is an important mosquito transmitted disease that is strongly influenced by meteorological and environmental conditions. Recent research has focused on forecasting DF case numbers based on meteorological data. However, these forecasting tools have generally relied on empirical models that require long DF time series to train. Additionally, their accuracy has been tested retrospectively, using past meteorological data. Consequently, the operational utility of the forecasts are still in question because the error associated with weather and climate forecasts are not reflected in the results. Using up-to-date weekly dengue case numbers for model parameterization and weather forecast data as meteorological input, we produced weekly forecasts of DF cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Each week, the past weeks’ case counts were used to re-parameterize a process-based DF model driven with updated weather forecast data to generate forecasts of DF case numbers. Real-time weather forecast data was produced using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction (NWP) system enhanced using additional high-resolution NASA satellite data. This methodology was conducted in a weekly iterative process with each DF forecast being evaluated using county-level DF cases reported by the Puerto Rico Department of Health. The one week DF forecasts were accurate especially considering the two sources of model error. First, weather forecasts were sometimes inaccurate and generally produced lower than observed temperatures. Second, the DF model was often overly influenced by the previous weeks DF case numbers, though this phenomenon could be lessened by increasing the number of simulations included in the forecast. Although these results are promising, we would like to develop a methodology to produce longer range forecasts so that public health workers can better prepare for dengue epidemics.",

Science 311, 1393, 2006) and sourced within a subsurface body of liquid water (eg, Postberg, F. et al. Nature 459, 1098, 2009; Porco, C.C. et al. AJ 148, 45, 2014, hereafter PEA], laced with organic compounds (eg, Waite, J.H. et al. Science 311, 1419, 2006), has been a significant one, with far-reaching astrobiological implications. In an extensive Cassini imaging survey of the moon’s south polar terrain (SPT), PEA identified 101 distinct, narrow jets of small icy particles erupting, with varying strengths, from the four major fractures crossing the SPT. A sufficient spread in stereo angles of the 107 images used in that work allowed (in some cases, many) pair-wise triangulations to be computed; precise surface locations were derived for 98 jets. Recently, it has been claimed (Spitale, J.N. et al. Nature 521, 57, 2015) that the majority of the geysers are not true discrete jets, but are “phantoms” that appear in shallow-angle views of a dense continuous curtain of material with acute bends in it. These authors also concluded that the majority of the eruptive material is not in the form of jets but in the form of fissure-style ‘curtain’ eruptions. We argue below the contrary, that because almost all the moon’s geysers were identified by PEA using multiple images with favorable viewing geometries, the vast majority of them, and likely all, are discrete jets. Specifically, out of 98 jets, no fewer than 90 to 95 were identified with viewing geometries that preclude the appearance of phantoms. How the erupting solids (i.e., icy particles) that are seen in Cassini images are partitioned between jets and inter-jet curtains is still an open question.",

The Euler equations are nonlinear hyperbolic equations that are widely used in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Therefore, acceleration of the method plays an important practical role in not only getting daily forecasts faster but also in obtaining more accurate (high resolution) results. The equation sets used in our atomospheric model NUMA (non-hydrostatic unified model of the atmosphere) take into consideration non-hydrostatic effects that become more important with high resolution. We use algorithms suitable for the single instruction multiple thread (SIMT) architecture of GPUs to accelerate solution by an order of magnitude (20x) relative to CPU implementation. For portability to heterogeneous computing environment, we use a new programming language OCCA, which can be cross-compiled to either OpenCL, CUDA or OpenMP at runtime.

            "abstract": "Cold winters and cold waves have recently occurred in Europe, central Asia and the Midwest to eastern United States, even as global mean temperatures set record highs and Arctic amplification of surface warming continued. Since 1979, Central Asia winter temperatures have in fact declined. Conjecture has it that more cold extremes over the mid-latitude continents should occur due to global warming and the impacts of Arctic sea ice loss. A Northern Hemisphere temperature signal termed the “Warm Arctic, Cold Continent” pattern has thus been surmised. Here we use a multi-model approach to test the hypothesis that such a pattern is indeed symptomatic of climate change. Diagnosis of a large model ensemble of historical climate simulations shows some individual realizations to yield cooling trends over Central Asia, but importantly the vast majority show warming. The observed cooling has thus likely been a low probability state of internal variability, not a fingerprint of forced climate change. We show that daily temperature variations over continents decline in winter due to global warming, and cold waves become less likely. This is partly related to diminution of Arctic cold air reservoirs due to warming-induced sea ice loss. Nonetheless, we find some evidence and present a physical basis that Arctic sea ice loss alone can induce a winter cooling over Central Asia, though with a magnitude that is appreciably smaller than the overall radiative-forced warming signal. Our results support the argument that recent cooling trends over central Asia, and cold extreme events over the winter continents, have principally resulted from atmospheric internal variability and have been neither a forced response to Arctic seas ice loss nor a symptom of global warming. The paradigm of climate change is thus better expressed as “Warm Arctic, Warm Continent” for the NH winter.",

The development of long-term wildland fire and fuel management strategies can be aided with an improved understanding of how climate and land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes could potentially affect the occurrence of atmospheric conditions favorable for extreme fire behavior and for prescribed-fire usage as a fuel reduction tactic. Using atmospheric reanalysis data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset, current and projected LULC data from the U.S. Geological Survey, and regional climate simulations performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and a suite of North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) modeling systems, we have examined recent trends and potential future changes in fire-weather patterns driven by regional climate and LULC changes. This presentation highlights some of the key findings of the assessments, including the identification of specific areas in the U.S. where future climate conditions may lead to more extreme wildfire behavior as quantified by an operational fire-weather index.

            "abstract": "The drive towards low carbon energy sources and increasing energy demand has resulted in a rapid rise in solar photovoltaics across the world. A substantial proportion of photovoltaics are large-scale ground-mounted systems, solar parks, causing a notable land use change. While the impacts of photovoltaic panel production and disposal have been considered, the consequences of the operation of solar parks on the hosting landscape are poorly resolved. Here, we present data which demonstrates that a solar park sited on permanent grassland in the UK significantly impacted the air and soil microclimate. Specifically, we observed (1) cooler soil under the photovoltaic panels during the summer and between the photovoltaic panel rows during the winter; (2) dampening of the diurnal variation in air temperature and absolute humidity from the spring to the autumn; (3) lower photosynthetically active radiation and a lower direct:diffuse under the panels; and (4) reduced wind speed between the panel rows and substantially reduced wind speeds under the panels. Further, there were differences in vegetation type and productivity and greenhouse gas emissions. Given the centrality of climate on ecosystem function, quantifying the microclimatic impacts of this emerging land use change is critical. We anticipate these data will help develop understanding of effects in other climates, under different solar park designs and the implications for the function and service provision of the hosting landscape.",

            "abstract": "Eritrea hosts the final stages of on-land East-African rifting, yet questions remain about how rifting transits from the Afar Depression to the Red Sea. In this study, we use data from recent deployments of 6 broadband seismometers in Eritrea together with deployments in Ethiopia to locate seismicity and determine the current focus of strain. Over 1000 events have been located with local magnitudes 0.7-5.0. A significant period of seismicity was observed on 1 July 2012 around Nabro volcano and is associated with the biggest event of mL 5 preceded by 33 events in the previous two days. It may be related to magma movement below Nabro. Other significant seismicity was observed on 25 December 2011 and is correlated with an earthquake of mL 4.2 and associated with 13 other events on the same day. This event is located around Hayli Gubbi and Ale Bagu volcanoes and could be related to the activities around these volcanoes. We use double difference relocations to improve accuracy and show two main clusters of seismicity, one oriented NW-SE in the Bada-Alid axis along the north-western boundary of the Danakil microplate and the other NE-SW, following the trend of the Biddu-Nabro volcanic complex. Our new estimates of seismicity demarcate the boundary between the Nubian, Somalian, and Danakil Microplate and suggest that the Danakil microplate may be broken in two along the Biddu-Nabro Volcanic complex. We estimate b-values for the different clusters of events and show that close to the major border faults near Massawa, average b-values are lower (0.65) than that found near the volcanic centres (1.2 – Bada-Alid, 0.81 – Biddu-Nabro). This may indicate that the stress is less in the volcanic regions and the seismicity is due to movement of magma fluids and strain is accommodated by the injection of magma. In contrast the earthquakes around Massawa occur in relatively stronger rocks suggesting strain may be accommodated by movement on larger faults.",

            "abstract": "While it is well-known that water vapor will play an important role in amplifying the direct warming effects of well-mixed greenhouse gasses like CO2 and methane, to date relatively little attention has been placed on the spatial variability of water vapor warming effects: increased diabatic forcing from precipitation and long wave radiation. Here, using 1850-2012 atmospheric simulations from the GEOS5 model, 1948-2015 NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 fields, 1979-2015 MERRA atmospheric reanalyses, and 1979-2015 NOAA OLR observations, we explore two potential thermodynamic contributions associated with water vapor. One contribution comes from the diabatic heating of the atmosphere by longwave radiation emissions. Another contribution comes from diabatic heating of the atmosphere by precipitation. This diabatic heating warms the local atmosphere, and over the tropical oceans, typically warms areas that are already warm. This increases local temperature gradients and potentially increases available potential energy both in the vertical (i.e. CAPE) and in the horizontal (i.e. APE). Using MERRA’s detailed thermodynamic budget terms, we examine several recent climate extremes, like the 2011 La Niña and the 2015 El Niño, suggesting that exceptional increases in water vapor radiative warming and precipitation may have helped to make both events more extreme: exceptionally high levels of water vapor in the western Pacific may have helped increase the warm west Pacific – cool Niño 4 SST gradient during the 2011 La Niña. Conversely, in 2015, exceptionally high levels of water vapor in the eastern Pacific may have helped increase the warm Niño 3.4 – cool western Pacific El Niño SST gradient. These water vapor influences can be radiative (warming warm SSTs), as well as dynamic, as enhanced precipitation releases more latent heat. Thus ‘anthropogenic’ water vapor may move around the climate system, helping to exacerbate warming in warm areas of the atmosphere. We examine this hypothesis quantitatively using water vapor-related changes in longwave radiation, diabatic forcing, APE, CAPE, and kinetic energy.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind fluctuations undergo a turbulent cascade that presumably results, in some unknown fashion, in the deposition of energy into randomized motions, i.e. \"heating.\" The observed evolution of spectra, cross-helicity, and non-adiabatic thermal properties of the plasma provide strong evidence for a nonlinear cascade, but the currently available temporal/spatial resolution of (mostly) single spacecraft measurments leaves many questions open. Large-scale particle-in-cell simulations allow us to explore the fate of cascading energy from \"MHD\" scales to the scales where wave-particle interactions become important. Simulations to date have shown a number of characteristics similar to that of solar wind plasma, including steeper magnetic spectra parallel to the mean magnetic field than perpendicular to it, a spectral break near the ion inertial length, and bounded anisotropic temperatures. Detailed analysis has revealed “magnetic holes” and nonthermal particle distributions. We are in the process of analyzing a variety of initial conditions as well as looking in more detail at issues such as nonlinear vs linear dynamics, and of how distribution functions vary with conditions in the plasma. This paper will report latest results on these and other issues.",

            "abstract": "The elastic properties of fault zone rocks at seismogenic depth play a key role in rupture nucleation, propagation, and damage associated with fault slip. In order to understand the seismic hazard posed by a fault we need to both measure these properties and understand how they govern that particular fault’s behavior. The Alpine Fault is the principal component of the active transpressional plate boundary through the South Island of New Zealand. Rapid exhumation along the fault provides an opportunity to study near-surface rocks that have experienced similar histories to those currently deforming at mid-crustal depths. In this study, we examine the acoustic properties of the Alpine Fault in Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP)-1 drill core samples and borehole logs from the shallow fault zone, DFDP-2 borehole logs from the hanging wall, and outcrop samples from a number of field localities along the central Alpine Fault. P- and S-wave velocities were measured at ultrasonic frequencies on saturated 2.5 cm-diameter core plugs taken from DFDP-1 core and outcrops. Sampling focused on mylonites, cataclasites, and fault gouge from both the hanging and foot walls of the fault in order to provide a 1-D seismic velocity transect across the entire fault zone. Velocities were measured over a range of effective pressures between 1 and 68 MPa to determine the variation in acoustic properties with depth and pore pressure. When possible, samples were cut in three orthogonal directions and S-waves were measured in two polarization directions on all samples to constrain velocity anisotropy. XRD and petrographic characterization were used to examine how fault-related alteration and deformation change the composition and texture of the rock, and to elucidate how these changes affect the measured velocities. The ultrasonic velocities were compared to sonic logs from DFDP to examine the potential effects of frequency dispersion, brittle deformation, and temperature on the measured properties. Further comparison to large-scale seismic tomography studies will focus on the role the high geothermal gradient plays in velocity reduction around the Alpine Fault.",

            "abstract": "Though permafrost distribution, temperature and active layer thickness at high spatial resolution are needed to better model the ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical processes including emission of greenhouse gases at regional and local scale, no such high-resolution permafrost map products existed for Arctic national parks of Alaska until recently. This was due to the lack of information about ecosystem properties such as soil and vegetation characteristics at high spatial resolution. In recent years, the National Park Service (NPS) has carried out several projects mapping ecotype and soil in the Arctic parks from Landsat satellite data at 28.5 m spatial resolution. We used these detailed ecotype and soil maps along with downscaled climate forcing from the IPCC and Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia (UK) to model near-surface permafrost distribution, temperature and active layer thickness at decadal time scale from the present through 2100 at 28.5 m resolution for the five Arctic national parks in Alaska: Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Noatak National Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, and Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. Our results suggest the near-surface permafrost distribution, i.e. permafrost immediately below the active layer, will likely decrease from the current 99% of the total park area (five parks combined) to 89% by 2050 and 36% by 2100. The near-surface permafrost will likely continue to exist in the northern half of the Gates of the Arctic and Kobuk Valley parks, and in majority of the Noatak preserves by 2100, though its temperature will be up to 5 °C warmer than the present at certain places. Taliks will likely occupy the ground below the active layer in rest of the park areas. These products fill an essential knowledge and data gap and complement research of other Arctic disciplines such as ecosystem modeling, hydrology and soil biogeochemistry. Also, these products enable the NPS personnel to identify geomorphic units vulnerable to climate change and incorporate that knowledge in making policy decisions about management of park resources and public use.",

            "abstract": "The Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) is a global high spatial resolution (1x1km) emission dataset for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The original version of ODIAC was developed at the Japanese Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (GOSAT) project to prescribe their inverse model. ODIAC first introduced the combined use of satellite-observed nighttime light data and individual power plant emission/geolocation information to estimate the spatial extent of fossil fuel CO2. The ODIAC emission data has been widely used by the international carbon cycle research community and appeared in a number of publications in the literature. Since its original publication in 2011, we have made numerous modifications to the ODIAC emission model and the emission data have been updated on annual basis. We are switching from BP statistical data based emission estimates to estimates made by Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In recent versions of ODIAC data, the emission seasonality has been adopted from the CDIAC monthly emission dataset. The emissions from international bunkers, which are not included in the CDIAC gridded emission data, are estimated using the UN Energy Database and included with the spatial distributions. In the next version of ODIAC emission model, we will explore the use of satellite data collected by the NASA’s Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite. We will estimate emission spatial distributions using global 500x500m nighttime lights data created from VIIRS data. We will also utilize a combustion detection algorithm Nightfire developed at NOAA National Geophysical Data Center to map gas flaring emissions. We also plan to expand our two emission sector emission distributing approach (power plant emission and non-point source emissions) by introducing a transportation emission sector which should improve emission distributions in urban and rural areas.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing has become the standard for collecting data to determine potential irrigation consumptive use in Wyoming for the Green River Basin. The Green River Basin within Wyoming is around 10.8 million acres, located in south western Wyoming and is a sub-basin of the Colorado River Basin. Grass hay is the main crop grown in the basin. The majority of the hay is grown at elevations 7,000 feet above mean sea level. Daily potential irrigation consumptive use is calculated for the basin during the growing season (May 1st to September 30th). To determine potential irrigation consumptive use crop coefficients, reference evapotranspiration (ET) and effective precipitation are required. Currently crop coefficients are the hardest to determine as most research on crop coefficients are based at lower elevations. Values for crop coefficients for grass hay still apply to high altitude grass hay, but the hay grows at a much slower rate than low elevation grass hay. To be able to more accurately determine the timing of the growth stages of hay in this basin, time-lapse cameras were installed at two different irrigated hay fields in the basin for the 2015 growing season and took pictures automatically once a day at 1 P.M.. Both of the fields also contained a permanent research grade weather station. Imagery obtained from these cameras was used as indicators of timing of the major growth stages of the hay and the length of days between the stages. A crop coefficient value was applied every day in the growing season based on the results from the imagery. Daily potential ET was calculated using the crop coefficients and the data from the on-site weather stations. The final result was potential irrigation induced crop consumptive use for each site. Using remote sensing provided necessary information that normally would be applied arbitrarily in determining irrigation induced consumptive use in the Green River Basin.",

            "abstract": "Ice formation in orographic mixed-phase clouds can enhance precipitation, and depends not only on cloud depth and temperature, but also on the type of aerosols that serve as ice nuclei (IN). The resulting precipitation from these clouds serves as a viable source of water, especially for mountainous regions such as the California Sierra Nevada. Thus, a better understanding of the sources of IN that impact these particular clouds is important for assessing water availability in California. We present a multi-site, multi-year (2011 and 2012) analysis of single, insoluble residue particles in precipitation samples that potentially served as IN and influenced ice formation in the clouds above Yosemite National Park, USA. Dust and biological particles typically represented the dominant fraction of the total residues (64% on average) and were ultimately removed via precipitation. Cloud glaciation was determined using GOES satellite observations and was not only dependent on high cloud tops (> 6.2 km MSL) and low temperatures (< −26°C), but also on the composition of the dust and biological residues. The greatest prevalence of ice-phase clouds occurred in conjunction with biologically-rich residues and mineral dust particularly rich in calcium, followed by iron and aluminosilicates. Dust and biological particles are known to serve as efficient IN, and thus we hypothesize that these precipitation residue types induced ice formation in the clouds above the site. The goal of this study is to use precipitation chemistry data to gain a better understanding of the potential sources of IN in the south-central Sierra Nevada, where aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions are under-studied and where mixed-phase orographic clouds are a key element to precipitation and thus water supply in California.",

The deformation data reveal the seasonal variations and net uplift.

Our study sites span tropical, temperate, and high elevation forests we assess several key predictions and assumptions of Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) as well as several other competing hypotheses for the role of climate, light, and plant traits on influencing forest demography and forest ecosystems. Specifically, we assess the importance of plant size, light limitation, size structure, and various climatic factors on forest growth, demography, and ecosystem functioning. We provide some of the first systematic tests of several key predictions from MST. We show that MST predictions are largely upheld and that new insights from assessing theories predictions yields new observations and findings that help modify and extend MST’s predictions and applicability. We discuss how theory is critically needed to further our understanding of how to scale pattern and process in ecology – from traits to ecosystems – in order to develop a more predictive global change biology.",

These differences can introduce artifacts such as striping in the imagery. In recent studies we have analyzed the striping pattern related to the detector level RSR difference in VIIRS Thermal Emissive Bands (TEB) M15 and M16, which includes line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) detector level response study and onboard detector stability evaluation using the solar diffuser. Now we extend these analysis to the Reflective Solar Bands (RSB) using MODTRAN atmospheric radiative transfer model (RTM) for detector level radiance simulation. Previous studies analyzed the striping pattern in the images of VIIRS ocean color and reflectance in RSB, further studies about the root cause for striping are still needed. In this study, we will use the MODTRAN model at spectral resolution of 1 cm^-1 under different atmospheric conditions for VIIRS RSB, for example band M1 centered at 410nm which is used for Ocean Color product retrieval. The impact of detector level RSR difference, atmospheric dependency, and solar geometry on the striping in VIIRS SDR imagery will be investigated. The cumulative histogram method used successfully for the TEB striping analysis will be used to quantify the striping. These analysis help S-NPP and J1 to better understand the root cause for VIIRS image artifacts and reduce the uncertainties in geophysical retrievals to meet the user needs.",

            "abstract": "The Earth and the Moon are constantly bombarded by interplanetary meteoroids. While meteoroids turn into shooting stars at Earth due to our thick atmosphere, the Moon’s surface is completely exposed. Impacts from the meteoroids into the lunar surface are continually creating ejecta clouds, each with approximately 1000 times the mass of the impactor. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) was an impact ionization dust detector onboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, designed to measure impact ejecta. LDEX observed a permanently present dust cloud engulfing the Moon which is non-spherical and asymmetric with respect to the direction of the orbital motion of the Earth/Moon about the Sun. These density distributions are consistent with ejecta clouds generated from the continual bombardment of the lunar surface by sporadic interplanetary dust particles shed from comets. During several of the well characterized annual meteor showers, LDEX observed an enhancement in the number of detected plumes, particularly during the Geminids. Stream parameters, such as the peak flux time and radiant direction, have been extracted for several meteoroid streams. Additionally, some detected plumes allowed for the determination of ejecta plume parameters. In this presentation, we describe the recently measured lunar dust exosphere in the context of understanding the response of an airless body to micrometeoroid bombardment. Identifying and characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of the dust environment of airless planetary bodies provides a novel way to understand their meteoroid environment by effectively using these objects as large surface area meteoroid detectors. Measurements from similar dust detectors near Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos would greatly improve our knowledge of the Martian meteoroid environment, and improve the safety for future manned and unmanned missions to Mars.",

SMAP provides for global monitoring of dynamic landscape freeze-thaw (FT) and soil moisture conditions, with model enhanced estimation of terrestrial carbon fluxes and environmental controls. Science objectives enabled by these data include improving understanding of water, energy and carbon cycle linkages, and reducing uncertainty regarding land-atmosphere CO2 exchange and the purported missing carbon sink. The Level 4 Carbon (L4_C) product uses SMAP FT retrievals and data assimilation enhanced soil moisture estimates with other ancillary inputs to quantify daily net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), component carbon fluxes and surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks globally. The L4_C product also quantifies underlying soil moisture and frozen season constraints to vegetation growth and respiration. Here we describe initial L4_C observations and performance, including global variations in carbon fluxes and anomalous impacts from recent climate extremes; example illustrations show the northern migration of spring thawing, growing season onset and subsequent summer drought decline in photosynthetic carbon uptake. Initial performance assessments indicate that the L4_C product achieves targeted NEE accuracy requirements within 1.6 g C m-2 d-1 (RMSE) over more than 80% of the global domain, and similar to tower eddy covariance based observations.

This suggests that the lithosphere is dissected by numerous deep faults, allowing magma to be channelled away from the site of melting along pre-existing structural trends. The generally low effective elastic thickness, $T_e$, ($\\leq$15 km) and lack of a plate age-$T_e$ relationship along the chain indicate that structural inheritance is also the major control on lithospheric strength near the extinct spreading centre. While the importance of structural inheritance in controlling magmatic behaviour is commonly acknowledged in continental settings, these results clearly demonstrate the need to also consider it in the oceanic realm.",

This has resulted in a reduced acceptance of these data products by GIS and general user communities. Common problems and challenges experienced by these data users include difficulty when:\nConsuming data products from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) that pre-date modern application software with commercial and open-source geospatial tools;\nIdentifying\n[MI1]\nan initial approach for developing a framework and plug-ins that interpret non-compliant data;\nDefining a methodology that is extensible across NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), scientific communities, and GIS communities by enabling other data centers to construct their own plug-ins and adjust specific data products; and\nPromoting greater use of NASA Data and new analysis utilizing GIS tools.\nTo address these challenges and make EOS data products more accessible and interpretable by GIS applications, a collaborative approach has been taken that includes the NASA Langley Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC), Esri, George Mason University (GMU), and the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) Group to create a framework and plugins to be applied to Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). This framework and its plugins offer advantages of extensibility within NASA EOSDIS, permitting other data centers to construct their own plugins necessary to adjust their data products.\nIn this session findings related to the framework and the development of GDAL plugins will be reviewed. Specifically, this session will offer a workshop to review documentation and training materials that have been generated for the purpose of guiding other NASA DAACs through the process of constructing plug-ins consistent with the framework as well as a review of the certification process by which the plugins can be independently verified as properly converting the data to the format and content required for use in GIS software.",

            "abstract": "A self-consistent theory for the effective elastic parameters of stochastic media with small-scale 3D heterogeneities has been developed using a 2nd-order Born approximation to the scattered wavefield (T. H. Jordan, GJI, in press). Here we apply the theory to assess how small-scale variations in the local anisotropy of the upper mantle affect seismic wave propagation. We formulate a anisotropic model in which the local elastic properties are specified by a constant stiffness tensor with hexagonal symmetry of arbitrary orientation. This orientation is guided by a Gaussian random vector field with transversely isotropic (TI) statistics. If the outer scale of the statistical variability is small compared to a wavelength, then the effective seismic velocities are TI and depend on two parameters, a horizontal-to-vertical orientation ratio ξ and a horizontal-to-vertical aspect ratio, η. If ξ = 1, the symmetry axis is isotropically distributed; if ξ < 1, it is vertical biased (bipolar distribution), and if ξ > 1, it is horizontally biased (girdle distribution). If η = 1, the heterogeneity is geometrically isotropic; as η à∞, the medium becomes a horizontal stochastic laminate; as η à0, the medium becomes a vertical stochastic bundle. Using stiffness tensors constrained by laboratory measurements of mantle xenoliths, we explore the dependence of the effective P and S velocities on ξ and η. The effective velocities are strongly controlled by the orientation ratio ξ; e.g., if the hexagonal symmetry axis of the local anisotropy is the fast direction of propagation, then vPH > vPV and vSH > vSV for ξ > 1. A more surprising result is the 2nd-order insensitivity of the velocities to the heterogeneity aspect ratio η. Consequently, the geometrical anisotropy of upper-mantle heterogeneity significantly enhances seismic-wave anisotropy only through local variations in the Voigt-averaged velocities, which depend primarily on rock composition and not deformation history.",

            "abstract": "Accretionary wedges develop through the episodic, discrete propagation of imbricate thrust faults at the deformation front and advancement of the decollement surface. In this process, diffuse compaction, propagation of new fractures, and slip and opening along preexisting fractures accommodate cumulative deformation to differing degrees throughout the evolution of the wedge. Previous analyses suggest that the energy budget reveals how strain is partitioned within this episodic system near the onset of thrust faulting. In this contribution, we perform a work optimization analysis with 2D, boundary element method, Fric2D numerical models of accretionary wedges. We use the displacement field captured through particle image velocimetry analysis of scaled physical experiments in dry sand to inform the loading applied to the numerical models. We introduce planar faults of various dips and locations within the wedge, and calculate the gain in efficiency (ΔWext) produced by adding each fault to the wedge. We consider the faults that produce the largest ΔWext to be most energetically favorable, and thus likely to develop at the onset of discrete failure in the wedge. We compare the predictions of this parametric work optimization approach to the geometry of through-going faults observed in the physical analog experiment. We find that the numerical work analysis closely predicts the dip and location of the first forethrust observed in the experiment, as well as the dip of the first backthrust in the experiment. A similar parametric study with planar faults of differing lengths in the modeled wedge shows that the dip of the fault that optimizes work can vary with fault length, and that forethrusts consistently produce a greater gain in efficiency than backthrusts of equal lengths.",

Today, most data analytics tools and techniques, sometimes applicable to Earth science, have targeted the business industry. In fact, the literature is nearly absent of discussion about Earth science data analytics.\nEarth science data analytics (ESDA) is the process of examining large amounts of data from a variety of sources to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and other useful information. ESDA is most often applied to data preparation, data reduction, and data analysis. Co-analysis of increasing number and volume of Earth science data has become more prevalent ushered by the plethora of Earth science data sources generated by US programs, international programs, field experiments, ground stations, and citizen scientists.\nThrough work associated with the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Federation, ESDA types have been defined in terms of data analytics end goals. Goals of which are very different than those in business, requiring different tools and techniques. A sampling of use cases have been collected and analyzed in terms of data analytics end goal types, volume, specialized processing, and other attributes. The goal of collecting these use cases is to be able to better understand and specify requirements for data analytics tools and techniques yet to be implemented.\nThis presentation will describe the attributes and preliminary findings of ESDA use cases, as well as provide early analysis of data analytics tools/techniques requirements that would support specific ESDA type goals.

Thus, large earthquakes in a region constitute semi-periodic sequences with recurrence times varying slightly from periodicity. Nava et al., 2013 and Quinteros et al., 2013 realized that not all earthquakes in a given region need belong to the same sequence, since there can be more than one process of stress accumulation and release in it; they also proposed a method to identify semi-periodic sequences through analytic Fourier analysis. This work presents improvements on the above-mentioned method: the influence of earthquake size on the spectral analysis, and its importance in semi-periodic events identification, which means that earthquake occurrence times are treated as a labeled point process; the estimation of appropriate upper limit uncertainties to use in forecasts; and the use of Bayesian analysis to evaluate the forecast performance. This improved method is applied to specific regions: the southwestern coast of Mexico, the northeastern Japan Arc, the San Andreas Fault zone at Parkfield, and northeastern Venezuela.",

            "abstract": "River systems construct stratigraphic successions and build land by depositing and redistributing sediments as they migrate across the entire basin. This mobility arises from the intrinsic variability of a river system but can also be forced by external changes. It is particularly observable in tectonically active basins where the basement can be partly uplifted and where sediments can come from multiple sources. Theoretically, the ability of these perturbations to steer channels depends on their capacity to create lateral topographic gradients at a faster rate than the aggradation. Following these lines, we present an experimental study on the impacts of lateral tilting by tectonics and lateral alluvial fans on rivers path. The experiment was conducted in the eXperimental Earth Scape facility, also known as the Jurassic tank, where the basement tilting rate can be monitored by controlling individually gravel subsidence through 108 hexagonal cells. The basin was relatively uplifted on one side of the tank according to an anticline-shape and sediments were input through two sources: a main, axial one and a lateral, secondary one. We analyzed the differences in the topographic signature and flow occupation of rivers in response to the uplift or the lateral sediment source as well as the competition of these forcing in the late stages of the experiments. We found that both tectonic tilting and fan activity tend to decrease the basin-wide channel mobility. Indeed, the area at the convergence of the two interacting fans is a long-lasting topographic low that tends to channelize the flow while areas away from it are less visited. The position of this boundary is correlated with the relative flow contribution from both fans. This highlights the self-healing capacity of fans that are able to rapidly restore a graded shape. As opposed to fans, an uplifted area will not heal but force rivers to carve long-lasting valleys and increase the relief. When eroded, these uplifted terranes collapse material in the river and slow down the lateral migration of channels. As a result, the extension of the lateral fan as sedimentation rate increases is not able to completely erase pre-existing reliefs.",

            "abstract": "Marine sea spray aerosol (SSA) particles make up a significant portion of natural aerosols and are therefore important in establishing the baseline for anthropogenic aerosol climate impacts. Scattering of solar radiation by aerosols affects Earth’s radiative budget and the degree of scattering is size-dependent. Thus, aerosols scatter more light at elevated relative humidities when they grow larger via water uptake. This growth depends critically on chemical composition. SSA can become enriched in organics during phytoplankton blooms, becoming less salty and therefore less hygroscopic. Subsaturated hygroscopic growth factors at 85% relative humidity (GF(85%)) of SSA particles were quantified during two mesocosm experiments in enclosed marine aerosol reference tanks (MARTs). The two experiments were conducted with filtered seawater collected at separate times from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography Pier in La Jolla, CA. Phytoplankton blooms in each tank were induced via the addition of nutrients and photosynthetically active radiation. The “indoor” MART was illuminated with fluorescent light and the other “outdoor” MART was illuminated with sunlight. The peak chlorophyll-a concentrations were 59 micrograms/L and 341 micrograms /L for the indoor and outdoor MARTs, respectively. GF(85%) values for SSA particles were quantified using a humidified cavity ringdown spectrometer and particle size distributions. Particle composition was monitored with a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) and an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). Relationships between the observed particle GFs and the particle composition markers will be discussed.",

One of the core components of the Group on Earth Observations – Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) targets monitoring Countries at Risk (component 3). The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) has a long history of utilizing remote sensing and crop modeling to address food security threats in the form of drought, floods, pest infestation, and climate change in some of the world’s most at risk countries. FEWS NET scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center and the University of Maryland Department of Geography have undertaken efforts to address component 3, by promoting the development of a collaborative Early Warning Crop Monitor (EWCM) that would specifically address Countries at Risk.\nA number of organizations utilize combinations of satellite earth observations, field campaigns, network partner inputs, and crop modeling techniques to monitor crop conditions throughout the world. Agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) provide agricultural monitoring information and reporting across a broad number of areas at risk and in many cases, organizations routinely report on the same countries. The latter offers an opportunity for collaboration on crop growing conditions among agencies. The reduction of uncertainty and achievement of consensus will help strengthen confidence in decisions to commit resources for mitigation of acute food insecurity and support for resilience and development programs. In addition, the development of a collaborative global EWCM will provide each of the partner agencies with the ability to quickly gather crop condition information for areas where they may not typically work or have access to local networks.\nUsing a framework developed by GEOGLAM for monitoring crop conditions in support of the Agricultural Market Information System, we developed an EWCM system for countries at risk. We present the current status of that implementation and highlight achievements to date along with future plans to support the needs of the global agricultural monitoring community.",

We find two distinct classes of IC lightning events with very high peak currents: the well-known but poorly understood narrow bipolar events (NBEs), and a previously unreported type that we call energetic in-cloud pulses (EIPs). Positive and negative EIPs produce slower radiation waveforms that occur in a very different lightning context comparing with NBEs. That context shows that EIPs are generated from existing negative polarity leaders that are propagating usually upward but sometimes downward. Specifically, positive EIPs are generated during upward negative leaders at the altitude of 10 – 13 km, while negative EIPs are observed during the early stages of downward negative leader processes. It is very interesting to note that the characteristics of EIPs and some previously reported terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) associated events are nearly identical. This may indicate a connection between EIPs and TGFs that requires more investigation. Our measurement also indicate the comparable radiation field of these very high peak current IC events and strong cloud-to-ground strokes, which may suggest the possible association of EIPs with ionospheric perturbations and optical emissions known as elves.",

            "abstract": "We determined the heat capacities of four series of glasses and liquids of basaltic and basaltic andesite compositions including two natural remelts from Fuego volcano, Guatemala, and two Fe-free analogs. The samples are low-alkali, Ca- and Mg-rich aluminosilicates with non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedrally-coordinated cation ratios (NBO/T) ranging between 0.33 and 0.67. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure between room temperature and ≈100 K above the glass transition for hydrous samples and up to ≈1800 K for dry samples. The water contents investigated range up to 5.34 wt.% (16.4 mol%).\nWater does not measurably affect the heat capacity of glasses (T <Tg). At the glass transition, there is a ≈30-40% change in heat capacity, which generally gets larger with increasing water content and with decreasing polymerization. The onset of the glass transition in hydrous samples also occurs below the Dulong-Petit limit of 3R/g atom.\nWe see little change in liquid heat capacity with increasing water content; hydrous liquid heat capacities are within 3-6% of the dry liquid, at low temperatures just above the glass transition. However, dry liquids show a decrease in heat capacity with increasing temperature above the glass transition, from supercooled to superliquidus temperatures. Liquid heat capacity values just above the glass transition range between 95-100 J/mol K, whereas liquid heat capacity values at superliquidus temperatures are between 85-91 J/mol K.\nComparison with other studies of the heat capacity of hydrous glasses and liquids shows that the liquid heat capacity of strongly depolymerized samples (NBO/T ≥ 0.8) increases with increasing water content, whereas depolymerized samples (0.4 ≤ NBO/T ≤ 0.8) or polymerized samples (NBO/T ≤ 0.4) generally show little change or a moderate decrease in liquid heat capacity with increasing water content.",

By comparing wave ray paths with the structure of the polar vortex obtained from the ECMWF operational model, we show that a unique generator of gravity waves that then propagate into the high latitude mesospause is the disturbance of the polar vortex near 40-km altitude due to the formation of baroclinic instabilities.",

            "abstract": "The NASA orbital missions Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Odyssey (ODY), and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have been exploring and monitoring the planet Mars since 1997. MGS executed its mapping mission between 1999 and 2006 in a frozen sun-synchronous, near-circular, polar orbit with the periapsis altitude at ~370 km and the dayside equatorial crossing at 2 pm Local Solar Time (LST). The spacecraft was equipped with onboard instrumentation to acquire radio science data and to measure spacecraft ranges to the Martian surface (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter). These measurements resulted in static and time-varying gravity field and high-resolution global topography of the planet.\nODY and MRO are still orbiting about Mars in two different sun-synchronous orbits, providing radio tracking data that indirectly measure both the static and time-varying gravity field and the atmospheric density. The orbit of ODY has its periapsis at ~390 km altitude and descending node at 4-5 pm LST. However, the spacecraft also collected measurements at lower altitudes (~220 km) in 2002 prior to the mapping phase. Since November 2006, MRO is in a low-altitude orbit with a periapsis altitude of 255 km and descending node at 3 pm LST. Radio data from MRO help improve the resolution of the static gravity field and measure the mass distribution of the polar caps, but the atmospheric drag at those altitudes may limit the benefits of these radio tracking observations.\nWe present a combined solution of the Martian gravity field to degree and order 110 and atmospheric density profiles with radio tracking data from MGS, ODY and MRO. The gravity field solution is combined with the MOLA topography yielding an updated map of Mars crustal thickness. We also show our solution of the Love number k2 and time-variable gravity zonal harmonics (C20 and C30, in particular). The recovered atmospheric density profiles may be used in atmospheric models to constrain the long-term variability of the constituents in the upper atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Land surface models (LSMs) are useful tools for understanding behaviors of land hydrologic variables at different time and spatial scales. LSM outputs, however, are marked with great uncertainties resulting from the simplified assumptions on the parameterization and processes of the land surface and a poor representation of both the natural and anthropogenic controls on the system. The Upper-Nile basin, over Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, is one region that is characteristic of significant human controls on streamflow, including Lake Victoria releases. The river Nile flow from Lake Victoria follows apriori rating curves that are not simulated by LSMs. Apart from management practices; the huge storage volume of Lake Victoria also modifies the seasonal characteristics of the Upper-Nile discharge, creating small seasonal variations in stream flow. In this study we calibrate several critical parameters in the Community Land Model (CLM.v4) in a multiobjective framework using total water storage anomalies (∆TWS) from GRACE, observed total runoff (Q) and estimated baseflow (BF) over the Upper-Nile basin. The goal is to improve the CLM parameters so that the model simulates the agreed curve (apriori) streamflow and baseflow with a better accuracy. We demonstrate the significance of improved parametrization by comparing model results of ∆TWS, Q and BF with a combination of insitu and estimated observations. Preliminary results based on RMSE statistics show that with calibration, simulations of ∆TWS, Q and BF achieve higher performance. Further, an improvement in the model’s capacity to simulate the water table depth is also evident with the calibration. Such results provide a basis for using CLM for other hydrologic experiments that could guide water resources management in this highly managed basin.",

            "abstract": "We present data-driven estimates of the regional net ecosystem exchange of CO2 across Alaska for three years (2012-2014) derived from CARVE (Carbon in the Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment) aircraft measurements. Integrating optimized estimates of annual NEE, we find that the Alaskan region was a small sink of CO2 during 2012 and 2014, but a significant source of CO2 in 2013, even before including emissions from the large forest fire season during 2013. We investigate the drivers of this interannual variability, and the larger spring and fall emissions of CO2 in 2013.\nTo determine the optimized fluxes, we couple the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting (PWRF) model with the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, to produce footprints of surface influence that we convolve with a remote-sensing driven model of NEE across Alaska, the Polar Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (Polar-VPRM). For each month we calculate a spatially explicit additive flux (∆F) by minimizing the difference between the measured profiles of the aircraft CO2 data and the modeled profiles, using a framework that combines a uniform correction at regional scales and a Bayesian inversion of residuals at smaller scales. A rigorous estimate of total uncertainty (including atmospheric transport, measurement error, etc.) was made with a combination of maximum likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo error propagation. Our optimized fluxes are consistent with other measurements on multiple spatial scales, including CO2 mixing ratios from the CARVE Tower near Fairbanks and eddy covariance flux towers in both boreal and tundra ecosystems across Alaska. For times outside the aircraft observations (Dec-April) we use the un-optimized polar-VPRM, which has shown good agreement with both tall towers and eddy flux data outside the growing season. This approach allows us to robustly estimate the annual CO2 budget for Alaska and investigate the drivers of both the seasonal cycle and the interannual variability of CO2 for the region.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic production of reactive nitrogen (Nr) has drastically altered the nitrogen cycle over the past few decades by causing it to accumulate in the environment. A nitrogen footprint (NF) estimates the amount of Nr released to the environment as a result of an entity’s activities. The Nitrogen Footprint Tool (NFT) for universities and institutions provides a standardized method for quantifying the NF for the activities and operations of these entities. The NFT translates data on energy use, food purchasing, sewage treatment, and fertilizer use to the amount of Nr lost to the environment using NOx and N2O emission factors, virtual nitrogen factors (VNFs) for food production, N reduction rates from wastewater treatment, and nitrogen uptake factors for fertilizer.\nAs part of the Nitrogen Footprint Project supported by the EPA, seven institutions (colleges, universities, and research institutions) have completed NFT assessments: University of Virginia, University of New Hampshire, Brown University, Dickinson College, Colorado State University, Eastern Mennonite University, and the Marine Biological Laboratory. The results of these assessments reveal the magnitude of impacts on the global nitrogen cycle by different activities and sectors, and will allow these institutions to set NF reduction goals along with management decisions based on scenarios and projections in the NFT. The trends revealed in early analysis of the results include geographic differences based on regional energy sources and local sewage treatment, as well as operational differences that stem from institution type and management. As an example of the impact of management, the amount and type of food served directly impacts the food production NF, which is a large percentage of the total NF for all institutions (35-75%). Comparison of these first NF results will shed light on the primary activities of institutions that add Nr to the environment and examine the differences between them.",

            "abstract": "Distal connections increasingly influence food systems’ governance: social actors in one geographic context produce intended and unintended consequences in distant locations, coupling the dynamics of socio-ecological systems. While these linkages are not new, economic globalization, urbanization and the dynamics of consumer preferences have accentuated these ‘telecoupled’ relationships in food systems. Telecoupling refers to the unexpected causal interactions among human-environment systems that were otherwise not linked. This paper presents a framework for evaluating telecoupling processes and outcomes in food systems, focusing on how the disparate scales of drivers and outcomes, diverse values of actors involved, and spatial and social distance combine to challenge socio-ecological system governance. We draw from two examples of food systems (coffee and maize) to argue that telecoupling, as a challenge for food systems, emerges when the institutions and mechanisms of governance acting over one system do not account for the consequences and interactions involving a different system. Telecoupling can stimulate new forms of governance, such as the development of codes of conduct and certification schemes, with positive impacts on food and livelihood security. Our cases suggest that the emergence of new governance arrangements is at least partially contingent on the prior existence of alternative social networks, which cultivate shared values, meanings and goals in food systems, as well as the capacity of affected actors to mobilize political influence and demonstrate plausible causal links. In the absence of such networks and associated capacities, the prior governance arrangements, although poorly adjusted to the new circumstances, are likely to persist, reinforcing existing power relations and the probability of undesirable social and ecological outcomes.",

            "abstract": "The streamflows of the Gila River, N.M. and the upper Rio Grande, with headwaters in Colorado are influenced by a range of drivers including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and, for the Gila, the North American Monsoon. At the catchment scale, runoff to the river is modulated by the interaction of snowmelt, rainfall, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and vegetation. A simple eco-hydological model is used to explain the seasonal cycles of flow of the Gila (strong spring peak, weak summer peak) and upper Rio Grande (single spring peak) in terms of precipitation, snowpack, and evapotranspiration. We then examine the drivers of streamflow variability using USGS gages located upstream of human extraction, precipitation and temperature data from PRISM, and SST data from ERSST. High spring streamflow tends to occur in response to prior winter El Nino but not all high and low streamflow events can be explained by the Pacific teleconnection. Decadal variations, including low flows in the Gila and upper Rio Grande since the mid 1990s, are explained in terms of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean decadal variability.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic restoration in urban creeks is increasingly regarded as a more sustainable option than traditional grey infrastructures in many countries including the UK and USA. Hydrologic restoration aims to recreate naturally oriented hydro-morphodynamic processes while adding ecological and amenity value to a river corridor. Nevertheless, the long-term hydraulic performance of river restorations is incompletely understood. The aim of this research was to investigate the long-term effects of river restoration on the water storage, flood attenuation and sediment dynamics of two urban creeks through detailed hydro-morphodynamic modelling. The first case study is based on Johnson Creek located at Portland, Oregon, USA, and the second case based on Ouseburn River in Newcastle upon Tyne, N.E. England. This study focuses on the downstream of the Johnson Creek, where creek is reconnected to a restored East Lents floodplain of 0.28 km2. In order to offset the increased urban runoff in the Ouseburn catchment, a number of attenuation ponds were implemented along the river. In this study, an integrated 1D and 2D flood model (ISIS – TUFLOW) and the recently updated layer-based hydro-morphodynamic model have been used to understand the long-term impacts of these restorations on the flood and sediment dynamics. The event-based simulations (500 year, 100 year, 50 year, 10 year and 5 year), as well as the continuous simulations based on the historical flow datasets were systematically undertaken. Simulation results showed that the flood storage as a result of river restoration attenuate the flood peak by up to 25% at the downstream. Results also indicated that about 30% of the sediments generated from the upstream deposited in the resorted regions. The spatial distribution and amount of short and long-term sediment deposition on the floodplain and pond are demonstrated, and the resulting potential loss of the flood storage capacity are analysed and discussed.",

In recent years, it has become necessary to factor in the effects of a changing climate as well. There has also been a growing appreciation of the linkage between food security and water availability. In 2009, Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) science partners began developing land surface modeling (LSM) applications to address these needs. With support from the NASA Applied Sciences Program, an instance of the Land Information System (LIS) was developed to specifically support FEWS NET. A simple crop water balance model (GeoWRSI) traditionally used by FEWS NET took its place alongside the Noah land surface model and the latest version of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and LIS data readers were developed for FEWS NET precipitation forcings (NOAA’s RFE and USGS/UCSB’s CHIRPS). The resulting system was successfully used to monitor and project soil moisture conditions in the Horn of Africa, foretelling poor crop outcomes in the OND 2013 and MAM 2014 seasons. In parallel, NOAA created another instance of LIS to monitor snow water resources in Afghanistan, which are an early indicator of water availability for irrigation and crop production. These successes have been followed by investment in LSM implementations to track and project water availability in Sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen, work that is now underway. Adoption of LSM and data assimilation technology has enabled FEWS NET to take greater advantage of remote sensing observations to robustly estimate key agro-climatological states, like soil moisture and snow water equivalent, building confidence in our understanding of conditions in data sparse regions of the world.",

            "abstract": "Though orography is expected to modulate the larger-scale climate response to increased greenhouse gases, the understanding of meso-scale climate changes in regions of highly varying topography has faced two major challenges. The first is that it requires simulating climate at spatial resolutions finer than those used by current global climate models (GCMs). The second challenge is the ever-decreasing signal-to-noise ratio as one examines climate change patterns at finer and finer granularity. Whereas regional climate models (RCMs) at high resolutions (~4 to 32 km) are being increasingly used, computational demands have placed practical constraints on their utility: few ensemble members and high internal variability leads to limited powers of detection, and even less of attribution. To explore orographic controls on meso-scale changes, climate of the western USA was simulated of the recent past (1986-2014) and of the mid-21st century (2031-2058) with RCP4.5 forcings assumed for the future. To overcome challenge #1, an RCM (HadRM3P; 25-km horizontal resolution) was nested in an atmospheric GCM (HadAM3P; 1.875° lon. by 1.25° lat.). Challenge #2 was overcome by averaging over a large ensemble (100 members per year) of simulations. The ensemble averaging reveals clear, non-random, meso-scale patterns in the spatial distribution of both seasonal temperature and precipitation changes (some surprising) that can be linked to concomitant land-surface and atmospheric processes (e.g., land surface-atmosphere energy exchanges, snow pack depletion, and shifting wind patterns).",

            "abstract": "Ice-mass loss in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica has nearly doubled in the past four decades and continues to increase at an accelerating pace. Mass loss from Thwaites Glacier (TG) now rivals that from Pine Island Glacier, and modeling and observational studies indicate that TG may have begun an irreversible retreat into a deep marine basin. This retreat may initiate the disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet sometime in the next several hundred years. However, models cannot yet provide accurate estimates of the rate of ice-mass loss and the resulting sea-level rise. One large unknown in modeling studies is the role of geologic controls on ice dynamics in the TG basin. We use a combination of active-source seismic, ice-penetrating radar and aerogravity data collected on TG to investigate whether upper-crustal structures can exert a fundamental control on TG’s ice dynamics. We focus especially on the distribution of sedimentary basins and their association with variability in the ice basal rheology and/or variations in basal-shear stress inferred from modeling.\nSeismic-reflection/refraction and radar profiling data collected along the main trunk of TG about 250 km inland of the current grounding line indicate the presence of ~10-km wide, >100-m deep sedimentary basin with a relatively smooth ice-bed interface. A co-located Bouguer gravity-anomaly profile, derived from NASA’s Operation IceBridge aerogravity data, shows a local gravity-anomaly low that approximately matches the location of this seismically-inferred sedimentary basin. Moreover, this sedimentary basin roughly corresponds to a region of low basal-shear stress inferred from ice-flow modeling. Therefore, we hypothesize that, for at least this location, the sedimentary basin provides a soft, smooth bed for ice flow; hence, upper-crustal structures are closely linked to the basal properties of TG.",

            "abstract": "The composition of Mercury is elusive because the planet is optically dark and exhibits a relatively featureless red visible and near-infrared spectrum. Studies have invoked opaque minerals and space weathering to explain these characteristics. In this study we used radiative transfer modeling of MESSENGER VIRS data to show that carbon is required to explain the detailed shape of the spectrum of Mercury from 0.3–1.5 µm. In this model, we assume the regolith comprises a high albedo host mineral, which contains nanophase and microphase iron and carbon. We varied the abundance of nanophase and microphase iron and carbon to fit the observed spectra. We found that the nanophase and microphase iron alone inadequately fits the visible portion of the observed spectra. By adding carbon, we find that nanophase and microphase iron and nanophase amorphous carbon fit the VIRS spectra consistently. We produced a global nanophase amorphous carbon map as well as nanophase and microphase iron maps. From the carbon map (see figure), we find that nanophase amorphous carbon is sensitive to geologic features associated with space weathering, such as fresh crater rays. Thus, amorphous carbon is a new indicator for regolith maturity. We also observe that the global average submicroscopic carbon content is 1.4±0.3 wt.% C, which is consistent with MESSENGER Gamma-Ray Spectrometer measurements. Using this abundance, we can constrain the source of water and carbon on Mercury. Assuming the water ice in the poles is derived from wet impactors, both asteroids and comets, and knowing C/H ratios of those sources, the surface nanophase carbon layer can be no thicker than 10 m if all carbon is derived from an exogenous source. It is almost certain the space weathered regolith on Mercury is thicker than 10 m, so the majority of carbon on Mercury must be endogenous.\nFigure: Nanophase amorphous carbon map. In this map, fresh craters and their rays are distinguishable by the lower proportion of carbon.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan experiences significant inland flooding, driven by torrential rainfall from plum rain storms and typhoons during summer and fall. From last 13 to 16 years data, ~3,000 buildings were damaged by such floods annually with a loss ~US$0.41 billion (Water Resources Agency). This long, narrow island nation with mostly hilly/mountainous topography is located at tropical-subtropical zone with annual average typhoon-hit-frequency of 3-4 (Central Weather Bureau) and annual average precipitation of 2502mm (WRA) - 2.5 times of the world's average. Spatial and temporal distributions of countrywide precipitation are uneven, with very high local extreme rainfall intensities. Annual average precipitation is 3000-5000mm in the mountainous regions, 78% of it falls in May-October, and the 1-hour to 3-day maximum rainfall are about 85 to 93% of the world records (WRA). Rivers in Taiwan are short with small upstream areas and high runoff coefficients of watersheds. These rivers have the steepest slopes, the shortest response time with rapid flows, and the largest peak flows as well as specific flood peak discharge (WRA) in the world.\nRMS has recently developed a countrywide inland flood model for Taiwan, producing hazard return period maps at 1arcsec grid resolution. These can be the basis for evaluating and managing flood risk, its economic impacts, and insured flood losses. The model is initiated with sub-daily historical meteorological forcings and calibrated to daily discharge observations at about 50 river gauges over the period 2003-2013. Simulations of hydrologic processes, via rainfall-runoff and routing models, are subsequently performed based on a 10000 year set of stochastic forcing. The rainfall-runoff model is physically based continuous, semi-distributed model for catchment hydrology. The 1-D wave propagation hydraulic model considers catchment runoff in routing and describes large-scale transport processes along the river. It also accounts for reservoir storage. Major historical flood events have been successfully simulated along with spatial patterns of flows. Comparison of stochastic discharge statistics w.r.t. observed ones from Hydrological Year Books of Taiwan over all recorded years are also in good agreement.",

            "abstract": "The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the most important agricultural regions in Asia and produces up to 50% of the cereal consumed in China each year. To meet increasing food demands without expanding croplands, annual agricultural practice in much of the NCP has changed from single to double cropping. The impact of double cropping on the regional climate, through biophysical feedbacks caused by changes in land surface conditions, remains largely unknown. Here we show that observed surface air temperatures during the inter-cropping season (June and July) are 0.40 °C higher over double cropping regions (DCRs) than over single cropping regions (SCRs), with increases in the daily maximum temperature as large as 1.02 °C. Using regional climate modelling, we attribute the higher temperatures in DCRs to reduced evapotranspiration during the inter-cropping period. The higher surface temperatures in June and July affect low-level circulation and, in turn, rainfall associated with the East Asian monsoon over the NCP and neighbouring countries. These findings suggest that double cropping in the NCP can amplify the magnitude of summertime climate changes over East Asia.",

            "abstract": "Global statistics of cloud optical thickness and particle size from visible and near-infrared satellite observations require an appropriate model for cloud particle morphology, namely, overall shape and surface texture. This study focuses on the inference of an ice cloud particle model from satellite polarimetric observations. The Polarization and Directionality of Earth’s Reflectance (POLDER) sensor aboard Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) satellite produced a global polarimetric reflectivity dataset covering nine years from 2004 to 2013. In the last decade, several attempts were carried out to infer particle shapes and roughness based on these data, revealing that a regular particle shape with some degree of surface roughness and a particle shape with high randomness are consistent with observations over thick ice clouds. However, the representative particle shape and optimal degree of roughness of optically thin ice clouds still remain uncertain. We demonstrate the methodology and the performance of the integrated polarimetric and non-polarimetric multispectral inference technique for the ice cloud particle shape and roughness. The technique assumes that a mixture of a few habits with multiple degrees of roughness can model cloud reflectivity to infer the best mixing ratio and degree of roughness based on the satellite dataset. The optical thickness is retrieved simultaneously by combining non-polarimetric (intensity) observations to the conventional polarization-only technique. The application of the method to one month of global data will be discussed with an emphasis on the latitudinal variation in our results.",

At the time of this writing, mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from late Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including clear filter and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. Images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the map in Fall 2015, followed by the Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) starting in December 2015.\nThe quad is named after crater Toharu (87 km diameter; 49°S, 155°E). The southern rim of Kerwan basin (284 km diameter) is visible along the northern edge of the quad, which is preserved as a low-relief scarp. The quad exhibits smooth terrain in the north, and more heavily cratered terrain in the south. The smooth terrain forms nearly flat-lying plains in some areas, such as on the floor and to the southeast of Kerwan, and overlies hummocky materials in other areas. These smooth materials extend over a much broader area outside of the quad, and appear to contain some of the lowest crater densities on Ceres. Impact craters exhibit a range of coinciding sizes and preservation styles. Smaller craters (<40 km) generally appear morphologically “fresh”, and their rims are nearly circular and raised above the surrounding terrain. Larger craters, such as Toharu, appear more degraded, exhibiting irregularly shaped, sometimes scalloped, rim structures, and debris lobes on their floors. Numerous craters (> 20 km) contain central mounds; at current FC resolution, it is difficult to discern if these are primary structures (i.e., central peaks) or secondary features.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, & Science Teams is acknowledged.

In the past 5 years, application of Raman-backscatter temperature sensing along optical fibers to glaciers, ice and permafrost regions has now become both possible and practical. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) provides spatially resolved temperatures at scales less than 50 cm, and over distances of kilometers. Temperature resolution is now commonly achievable down to 20-30 mK, with sampling frequencies of 30-60 seconds. While individual point measurements of temperature are valuable, DTS systems provide far more exciting high-resolution measurement of thermal gradients. In this work, the resolution of DTS-derived thermal gradients in ice and frozen ground are presented, along with examples of the use of DTS-derived thermal gradients to derive geothermal heat fluxes, glacial basal melt rates and time-variability in thermal gradients to infer surface boundary condition changes.",

            "abstract": "The significance of thermal heterogeneities in small surface water bodies as drivers of mixing and for habitat provision is increasingly recognized, yet obtaining three-dimensionally resolved observations of the thermal structure of lakes and rivers remains challenging. For relatively shallow water bodies, observations of water temperature from aerial platforms are attractive: they do not require shoreline access, they can be quickly and easily deployed and redeployed, facilitating repeated sampling, and they can rapidly move between measurement locations, allowing multiple measurements to be made during single flights. However, they are also subject to well-known limitations including payload, flight duration and operability, and their effectiveness as a mobile platform for thermal sensing is still poorly characterized. In this talk, I will introduce an aerial thermal sensing platform that enables water temperature measurements to be made and spatially located throughout a water column, and present preliminary results from initial field experiments comparing in-situ temperature observations to those made from the UAS platform. The results highlight the potential scalability of the platform to provide high-resolution 3D thermal mapping of a ~1 ha lake in 2-3 flights (circa 1 hour), sufficient to resolve diurnal variations. Operability constraints and key needs for further development are also identified.",

            "abstract": "Air Force Weather (AFW) has documented requirements for global cloud analysis and forecasting to support DoD missions around the world. To meet these needs, AFW utilizes a number of cloud products. Cloud analyses are constructed using 17 different near real time satellite sources. Products include analysis of the individual satellite transmissions at native satellite resolution and an hourly global merge of all 17 sources on a 24km grid. AFW has also recently started creation of a time delayed global cloud reanalysis to produce a ‘best possible’ analysis for climatology and verification purposes. Forecasted cloud products include global short-range cloud forecasts created using advection techniques as well as statistically post processed cloud forecast products derived from various global and regional numerical weather forecast models. All of these cloud products cover different spatial and temporal resolutions and are produced on a number of different grid projections. The longer term vision of AFW is to consolidate these various approaches into uniform global numerical weather modeling (NWM) system using advanced cloudy-data assimilation processes to construct the analysis and a licensed version of UKMO’s Unified Model to produce the various cloud forecast products.\nIn preparation for this evolution in cloud modeling support, AFW has started to aggressively benchmark the performance of their current capabilities. Cloud information collected from so called ‘active’ sensors on the ground at the DOE-ARM sites and from space by such instruments as CloudSat, CALIPSO and CATS are being utilized to characterize the performance of AFW products derived largely by passive means.

            "abstract": "NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on January 31st, 2015. The objective of the mission is global mapping of surface soil moisture and landscape freeze/thaw state. SMAP utilizes an L-band radar and radiometer sharing a rotating 6-meter mesh reflector antenna. The SMAP spacecraft is in a 685-km Sun-synchronous near-polar orbit, and viewing the surface at a constant 40-degree incidence angle with a 1000-km swath width. Merging of the high-resolution active (radar) and coarse-resolution but high-sensitivity passive (radiometer) L-band observations enable an unprecedented combination of accuracy, resolution, coverage and revisit-time for soil moisture and freeze/thaw state retrievals. However, on July 7th, 2015, the SMAP radar encountered an anomaly and is currently inoperable. Efforts are being made to revive the SMAP radar. Due to the present status of the SMAP observatory, nearly ~2.5 months (from the end of In-Orbit-Check April 13th, 2015 to July 7th, 2015) of the SMAP Active Passive product will be available to public through the NASA DAAC at National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The baseline L2_SM_AP product is retrieved soil moisture from the disaggregated/downscaled brightness temperature obtained by merging the coarse-resolution (~36 km) radiometer brightness temperature data and the high-resolution (~3 km) radar backscatter data. The baseline product is intermediate scale 9 km global soil moisture information. Experimentally, a much higher resolution global surface soil moisture data set is also produced at 3 km. This experimental product covering the 2.5 Spring/Summer months is the focus of this presentation. We specifically focus on the analysis of errors and reliability of this data set. The errors in disaggregated brightness temperatures and the retrived soil moisture estimates are discussed. In the presentation the accuracies of the SMAP L2-SM_AP soil moisture retrievals will be shown using summary comparisons with in situ data over the core validation sites.",

            "abstract": "As the global climate changes, understanding the variations in water storage is increasingly important. In Iceland, glaciers cover approximately 11% of the land surface and comprise the country’s largest reservoir of freshwater. Seasonal variations in winter snowfall and summer melting can impact river discharge and water availability for utilities such as hydropower. A dense network of continuously operating GPS sites record rapid crustal uplift exceeding 30 mm/year and accelerations up to 1-2 mm/yr2 reflecting the recent accelerating ice mass loss from the major Icelandic ice caps. Additionally, CGPS records seasonal motion: the elastic response to annual snow and melt seasons. Amplitudes of vertical seasonal motion approach 10 mm for those sites in the Central Highlands region in close proximity to the Vatnajökull ice cap. We demonstrate the utility of CGPS-measured displacements for estimating seasonal ice mass changes using a simple least squares inversion. We utilize all 3 components of motion, taking advantage of the seasonal motion recorded in the horizontal. We remove secular velocities and accelerations as well as seasonal motions due to atmospheric, hydrologic, and non-tidal ocean loading. We model GPS noise as a flicker process and set the standard deviation for that noise to be 1 mm for the horizontal components and 3 mm for the vertical. We calculate unit responses to each of the 5 largest ice caps in central Iceland at each of the 62 CGPS locations using both the RELAX and REAR codes and investigate the impact that Earth’s structure has on our modeling results, noting here that the standard PREM Earth model results in calculated displacements smaller than the observations by a factor of two. Our preliminary inversion results match available summer and winter mass balance measurements well. We are often able to reproduce the year-to-year variations in loading and melting within our calculated 95% confidence bounds.",

            "abstract": "Following a large earthquake, seismic hazard can be orders of magnitude higher than the long-term average as a result of aftershock triggering. Due to this heightened hazard, there is a demand from emergency managers and the public for rapid, authoritative, and reliable aftershock forecasts.\nIn the past, USGS aftershock forecasts following large, global earthquakes have been released on an ad-hoc basis with inconsistent methods, and in some cases, aftershock parameters adapted from California. To remedy this, we are currently developing an automated aftershock product that will generate more accurate forecasts based on the Reasenberg and Jones (Science, 1989) method. To better capture spatial variations in aftershock productivity and decay, we estimate regional aftershock parameters for sequences within the Garcia et al. (BSSA, 2012) tectonic regions. We find that regional variations for mean aftershock productivity exceed a factor of 10.\nThe Reasenberg and Jones method combines modified-Omori aftershock decay, Utsu productivity scaling, and the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude distribution. We additionally account for a time-dependent magnitude of completeness following large events in the catalog. We generalize the Helmstetter et al. (2005) equation for short-term aftershock incompleteness and solve for incompleteness levels in the global NEIC catalog following large mainshocks.\nIn addition to estimating average sequence parameters within regions, we quantify the inter-sequence parameter variability. This allows for a more complete quantification of the forecast uncertainties and Bayesian updating of the forecast as sequence-specific information becomes available.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to better understand deformation in the mantle lithosphere beneath continental strike-slip plate boundaries through Sp receiver function analysis of mantle discontinuities beneath the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). This fault zone marks the boundary between the Anatolian and Eurasian plates. Sp receiver functions were calculated using waveforms filtered with a variety of bandpasses, and 33 s to 4 s was found to produce coherent images while reducing interference between phases from the Moho and shallow mantle discontinuities. Using common conversion point stacking, we calculated 3D images of scattering beneath the region for two different cases: migration with the S-wave and P-wave velocities from the waveform tomography model of Fichtner et al. (2013) and with the AK135 velocity model. In both cases, a clear Moho is observed and Moho depth does not systematically vary between sides of the NAF. In contrast, shallow mantle discontinuities show pronounced changes in depth that correlate with strong lateral variations in mantle velocity observed in the Fichtner et al. tomography model, and some of these discontinuity depth variations occur within 50 km horizontally of the surface expression of the NAF. Where the tomography contains a clear high velocity lithospheric mantle layer, the Sp stack contains a negative velocity gradient at depths comparable to the base of the high velocity layer that can be interpreted as the seismological LAB. Where the tomography shows low mantle velocities that persist to the crust, a feature that may represent either anomalously low velocity lithosphere or upwelling asthenosphere beneath thin lithosphere, mantle discontinuities differ significantly from surrounding regions. Mantle discontinuity depth variations beneath the NAF also occur when the data are migrated with the AK135 model. Hence, the presence of the discontinuity depth variations is not an artifact of the assumed velocity model, although depths differ between models. These initial results suggest that blocks of lithosphere with contrasting mantle discontinuity structures are juxtaposed across the NAF system.",

            "abstract": "Passive optical remote sensing of high latitude regions faces many challenges including a short acquisition season and poor illumination. Identification of surface minerals can be complicated by steep terrain and vegetation cover. In July 2014, the HyMap* imaging spectrometer was flown over two study areas in Alaska. Contemporaneously, field spectra and samples of geologic units were collected, including altered and unaltered parts of intrusions hosting mid-Cretaceous porphyry copper deposits at Orange Hill and Bond Creek in the eastern Alaska Range. The HyMap radiance data were converted to surface reflectance using a radiative transfer correction program and reflectance spectra of calibration sites. Reflectance data were analyzed with the Material Identification and Characterization Algorithm (MICA), a module of USGS PRISM (Processing Routines in IDL for Spectroscopic Measurements; \nspeclab.cr.usgs.gov\n). Large areas of abundant epidote/chlorite, muscovite/illite, calcite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and (or) pyrophyllite were mapped, which are minerals typically formed during alteration of host rocks surrounding porphyry copper deposits. A map showing the wavelength position of the muscovite/illite absorption feature was made. Shifts in wavelength position have been related to the aluminum composition of micas and areas of high metal concentrations in past studies. In July 2015, rock and spectral sampling was continued in areas with surface exposures of copper- and molybdenum-bearing sulfides. Also, high-spatial resolution (~6 cm pixel size) imaging spectrometer data were collected at the Orange Hill deposit using the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) HySpex imaging spectrometer (\nwww.hyperspectral.alaska.edu\n). Laboratory, field, and airborne spectra are being examined to define indicators of mineralization. The study results will be used to assess the effectiveness of spectroscopic remote sensing for geologic mapping and exploration targeting in Alaska and other high latitude regions. *Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.",

            "abstract": "A century of fire suppression in the Western United States has drastically altered the historically fire-adapated ecology in California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains. Fire suppression is understood to have increased the forest cover, as well as the stem density, canopy cover and water demand of montane forests, reducing resilience of the forests to drought, and increasing the risk of catastrophic fire by drying the landscape and increasing fuel loads. The potential to reverse these trends by re-introducing fire into the Sierra Nevada is highly promising, but the likely effects on vegetation structure and water balance are poorly quantified. The Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park represents a unique experiment in the Sierra Nevada, in which managers have moved from fire suppression to allowing a near-natural fire regime to prevail since 1972. Changes in vegetation structure in the Illilouette since the restoration of natural burning provides a unique opportunity to examine how frequent, mixed severity fires can reshape the Sierra Nevada landscape. We characterize these changes from 1969 to the present using a combination of Landsat products and high-resolution aerial imagery. We describe how the landscape structure has changed in terms of vegetation composition and its spatial organization, and explore the drivers of different post-fire vegetation type transitions (e.g. forest to shrubland vs. forest to meadow). By upscaling field data using vegetation maps and Landsat wetness indices, we explore how these vegetation transitions have impacted the water balance of the Illilouette Creek Basin, potentially increasing its resilience in the face of drought, climate change, and catastrophic fire. In a region that is adapted to frequent disturbance from fire, this work helps us understand how allowing such natural disturbances to take place can increase the sustainability of diverse landscapes in the long term.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) of oil and natural gas (O&G) wells is a widely applied technology that can increase yields from tight geologic formations. However, it is unclear how fracking may impact shallow groundwater; previous research into its effects has produced conflicting results. Much of the worry over potential impacts to water quality arises from concerns about the produced water. The water produced from O&G formations is often salty, contains toxic dissolved elements, and can be radioactive. If fracking activities cause or increase connectivity between O&G formations and overlying groundwater, there may be risks to aquifers. As one part of a groundwater quality study in Antrim and Kalkaska Counties, MI, samples were collected from the unconfined glacial aquifer (3-300 m thick) and produced water from the underlying Antrim formation, a shallow (180-670 m deep) natural gas producing black shale. Groundwater samples were collected between 200 to 10,000 m distance from producing Antrim gas wells and from a range of screened intervals (15-95 m). Samples were analyzed for major constituents (e.g., Br, Cl), pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The specific conductance of groundwater samples ranged from 230-1020 μS/cm; DO ranged from 0.4-100% saturation. Preliminary results show a slight inverse correlation between specific conductance and proximity to producing Antrim wells. The observed range of DO saturation in glacial aquifer groundwater appears to be related to both screened depth of the water wells and proximity to Antrim wells. During sampling, some well owners expressed concerns about the effects of fracking on groundwater quality and reported odd smells and tastes in their water after O&G drilling occurred near their homes. The results of this study and reported observations provide evidence to suggest a potential hydrogeological connection between the Antrim formation and the overlying glacial aquifer in some locations; it also raises questions about water quality in Antrim and Kalkaska counties. Further investigation is needed to address questions raised in this study. As the controversy surrounding fracking is growing and the application of this technology spreads worldwide, it is important for the questions about fracking and groundwater quality to be well addressed.",

This presentation focuses on further evaluation of the proposed modifications with two one-month experiments for summer and winter seasons through the verification of GFS forecasts against surface and sounding observations. It was found that the modifications can substantially avoid late afternoon rapidly dropping 2-m temperature and decoupling when a cessation of turbulent transport between the surface and the atmosphere due to high near surface atmospheric stability happens, and reduce the cold bias of 2-m temperature during nighttime. Furthermore, the surface dew point temperature, surface wind speed and scores for light and medium precipitation are also improved. In the future, new land data sets such as vegetation and soil types, near real-time green vegetation fraction and snow albedo will be updated and we expect to further reduction of 2-m temperature bias in the GFS model.",

            "abstract": "Water resource systems have provided vital support to transformative growth in the Southwest United States and the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area where the Salt River Project (SRP) currently satisfies 40% of the area’s water demand from reservoir storage and groundwater. Large natural variability and expectations of climate changes have sensitized water management to risks posed by future periods of excess and drought. The conventional approach to impacts assessment has been downscaled climate model simulations translated through hydrologic models; but, scenario ranges enlarge as uncertainties propagate through sequential levels of modeling complexity. The research often does not reach the stage of specific impact assessments, rendering future projections frustratingly uncertain and unsuitable for complex decision-making. Alternatively, this study inverts the common approach by beginning with the threatened water system and proceeding backwards to the uncertain climate future. The methodology is built upon reservoir system response modeling to exhaustive time series of climate-driven net basin supply. A reservoir operations model, developed with SRP guidance, assesses cumulative response to inflow variability and change. Complete statistical analyses of long-term historical watershed climate and runoff data are employed for 10,000-year stochastic simulations, rendering the entire range of multi-year extremes with full probabilistic characterization. Sets of climate change projections are then translated by temperature sensitivity and precipitation elasticity into future inflow distributions that are comparatively assessed with the reservoir operations model. This approach provides specific risk assessments in pragmatic terms familiar to decision makers, interpretable within the context of long-range planning and revealing a clearer meaning of climate change projections for the region. As a transferable example achieving actionable findings, the approach can guide other communities confronting water resource planning challenges.",

            "abstract": "A large portion of precipitation seen in the Great Plains region of the United States falls from nocturnal convection. Quite often, nocturnally initiated convection may grow upscale into a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) that in turn may cause high impact weather events such as severe wind, flooding, and even tornadoes. Thus, correctly predicting nocturnal convective initiation is an integral part of forecasting for the Great Plains. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most challenging aspects of forecasting for this region. Many forecasters familiar with the Great Plains region have noted that elevated nocturnal convective initiation seems to favor a few distinct and rather diverse modes, which pose varying degrees of forecasting difficulties. This study investigates four of these modes, including initiation caused by the interaction of the low level jet and a frontal feature, initiation at the nose of the low level jet without the presence of a frontal feature, linear features ahead of and perpendicular to a forward propagating MCS, and initiation occurring with no discernible large scale forcing mechanism. Improving elevated nocturnal convective initiation forecasts was one of the primary goals of the Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) field campaign that took place from June 1 to July 15, 2015, which collected a wealth of convective initiation data. To coincide with these data sets, nocturnal convective initiation episodes from the 2015 summer season were classified into each of the aforementioned groups. This allowed for a thorough investigation of the frequency of each type of initiation event, as well as identification of typical characteristics of the atmosphere (forcing mechanisms present, available instability, strength/location of low level jet, etc.) during each event type. Then, using archived model data and the vast data sets collected during the PECAN field campaign, model performance during PECAN for each convective initiation mode was compared to the high quality data sets in order to flesh out why certain convective initiation modes may be more difficult to forecast than others.",

            "abstract": "The West African tropical forest (referred to as the Upper Guinean forest, UGF), is a global biodiversity hotspot providing vital ecosystem services for the region’s socio-economic and environmental wellbeing. It is also one of the most fragmented and human-modified tropical forest ecosystems, with the only remaining large patches of original forests contained in protected areas. However, these remnant forests are susceptible to continued fire-mediated degradation and forest loss due to intense climatic, demographic and land use pressures. We analyzed human and climatic drivers of fire activity in the sub-region to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of these risks. We utilized MODIS active fire and burned area products to identify fire activity within the sub-region. We measured climatic variability using TRMM rainfall data and derived indicators of human land use from a variety of geospatial datasets. We used a boosted regression trees model to determine the influences of predictor variables on fire activity. Our analyses indicated that the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is a key driving factor of fire activity in the UGF. Anthropogenic effects on fire activity in the area were evident through the influences of agriculture and low-density populations. These human footprints in the landscape make forests more susceptible to fires through forest fragmentation, degradation, and fire spread from agricultural areas. Forested protected areas within the forest savanna mosaic experienced frequent fires, whereas the more humid forest areas located in the south and south-western portions of the study area had fewer fires as these rainforests tend to offer some buffering against fire encroachment. These results improve characterization of UGF fire regime and expand our understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of tropical forest fires in response to human and climatic pressures.",

An overview will be presented on wind, relative humidity, and temperature model errors as measured against rawinsonde and aircraft observations in common at 12h forecast duration for global and regional models. Systematic errors common to both applications will be presented. A common problem with deficient cloud cover has been evident in both 6h (3km HRRR-WRF-ARW) regional forecasts and 6-month coupled-global (FIM-HYCOM) forecasts, allowing improvements in a common deep/shallow convection scheme (Grell-Freitas) with subgrid-scale clouds to be evaluated across time scales.",

            "abstract": "This paper evaluates cloud resolving model (CRM) and cloud system-resolving model (CSRM) simulations of a midlatitude cirrus case with comprehensive observations collected under the auspices of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) program and with spaceborne observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) A-train satellites. Vertical profiles of temperature, relative humidity and wind speeds are reasonably well simulated by the CSRM and CRM but there are remaining biases in the temperature, wind speeds and relative humidity, which can be mitigated through nudging the model simulations toward the observed radiosonde profiles. Simulated vertical velocities are underestimated in all simulations except in the CRM simulations with grid spacings of 500m or finer, which suggests that turbulent vertical air motions in cirrus clouds need to be parameterized in GCMs and in CSRM simulations with horizontal grid spacings on the order of 1km. The simulated ice water content and ice number concentrations agree with the observations in the CSRM but are underestimated in the CRM simulations. The underestimation of ice number concentrations is consistent with the overestimation of radar reflectivity in the CRM simulations and suggests that the model produces too many large ice particles especially toward cloud base. Simulated cloud profiles are rather insensitive to perturbations in the initial conditions or the dimensionality of the model domain but the treatment of the forcing data has a considerable effect on the outcome of the model simulations. Despite considerable progress in observations and microphysical parameterizations, simulating the microphysical, macrophysical and radiative properties of cirrus remains challenging. Comparing model simulations with observations from multiple instruments and observational platforms is important for revealing model deficiencies and for providing rigorous benchmarks. However, there still is considerable need for reducing observational uncertainties and providing better observations especially for relative humidity and for the size distribution and chemical composition of aerosols in the upper troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of the major isotopologues of atmospheric methane have the potential to improve our understanding of the methane budget at the global and regional scale. Using global and regional chemical transport models, we can predict the atmospheric variations in 13C-CH4 and D-CH4, for given assumptions about source isotope ratios and fractionation due to methane sinks. This information can then be used to test the impact that various measurement techniques, technologies and sampling strategies have on our knowledge of the methane budget. We show that, at the global scale, an extensive and accurate network of isotopic measurements can lead to a reduction in the uncertainties in the major global sources. Furthermore, measurements of the D/H ratio in methane may provide some level of uncertainty reduction in the magnitude of the OH sink. Uncertainties can be reduced with improved precision and accuracy of the atmospheric observations. However, to make the most of an atmospheric methane isotope network, we show that the characterisation of source isotope ratios must also be improved. Finally, we put the theory into practice by deriving sector-specific methane sources at the national scale using 13C-CH4 samples collected as part of the Greenhouse gAs Uk and Global Emissions (GAUGE) project. GAUGE measurements are made from a tall tower site to the east of the UK, a background station on the west coast of Ireland and during intensive aircraft sampling campaigns. We will discuss the challenges and benefits associated with adding isotopic information to a national greenhouse gas sampling network and outline a strategy for improvements in the future.",

            "abstract": "Ozone in the lower troposphere acts as an air pollutant affecting human health and vegetation. Tropospheric ozone sources and variability are not yet fully identified or understood and recent studies reveal the importance of increasing the number of tropospheric ozone profiling stations and long term measurements. As part of the international monitoring network NDACC, and the U.S.-based network TOLNet, a differential absorption lidar has been performing tropospheric ozone measurements (3-20 km) at the JPL Table Mountain Facility (TMF, California) since 1999, and surface measurements have been performed since 2013 with a UV photometric analyzer. Because of the site’s geolocation and high elevation, background tropospheric ozone, unaffected by the boundary layer dynamics and local anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors, is usually expected. However, transboundary ozone contributions such as stratospheric intrusions and Asian pollution episodes are frequently detected. In this study, a statistical analysis of the 14-year lidar profiles and the 2.5-year surface data is presented. Seasonal, interannual and diurnal variability and its possible causes (e.g. El Nino/La Nina events, North American Monsoon) are investigated. Together with the high elevation surface data gathered at TMF, surface data from ARB stations nearby are analyzed to understand the lowermost tropospheric ozone variability component. The frequency of stratospheric intrusions and Asian pollution episodes reaching the Western U.S. is also examined in an attempt to understand the relative contribution of each process to the observed variability throughout the troposphere. The Table Mountain surface and lidar measurements are expected to contribute significantly to the emerging system of global air quality observations, and to the improvement of global and regional data assimilation and modeling.",

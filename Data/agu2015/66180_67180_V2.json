            "abstract": "In the Western US (WUS) background ozone is a significant fraction of the health and regulatory thresholds. Several researchers have previously shown that background free tropospheric O3 can significantly impact surface sites, including urban areas in the WUS (e.g. Jaffe 2011; Langford et al 2012; Lin et al 2012; Wigder et al 2013).\nThe Mt Bachelor Observatory (MBO) has measured ozone in the free troposphere since 2004. Between 2004-2014, the median springtime ozone mixing ratio was found to be 44 ppbv, with a positive trend of 0.7 ppbv per year (Gratz et al 2014). Superimposed on this trend are daily and inter-annual variations. Up until 2014, the spring of 2012 had the highest median ozone mixing ratio at MBO (48 ppbv) and this had significant influence on many surface sites across the WUS including, for example, Boise ID, Salt Lake City UT and Reno NV. Each of these sites demonstrated an unusual number of days in spring 2012 with an 8-hour maximum ozone mixing ratios greater than 70 ppbv. In 2012, this influence reflected an enhanced flux from the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere to the lower free troposphere and ultimately the surface.\nIn spring of 2015, we recorded our highest median ozone mixing ratio ever observed at MBO (56 ppbv). In contrast to 2012, enhanced ozone in the spring 2015 was associated with transport of emissions from Siberian wildfires. We expect that surface ozone at urban sites in the WUS will be significantly enhanced in the spring of 2015, as we saw in 2012.\nThe combined influence of increasing baseline ozone and interannual variations on top of this rising baseline means that surface ozone in the WUS will continue to be an increasing challenge for air quality managers. While observations at MBO are extremely useful in this regard, we propose that additional observations of baseline ozone would prove useful to better understand the influence of background ozone on urban air quality in the WUS.",

            "abstract": "On November 23, 2014, after almost 20 years of dormancy, a major Hawaiian- to Strombolian-type eruption started at Fogo Volcano, Cape Verde. The eruption was very similar in style to previous eruptions and occurred from a vent at the western flank of the Pico do Fogo stratocone (2829 m). During this eruption, about 200 residential buildings and a significant portion of agricultural land were destroyed by lava flows. Also, the only road was blocked by lava, impeding evacuation and emergency response. As future eruptions could follow a similar pattern, and reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure has commenced, a detailed analysis of the pre- and post-eruptive topography, as well as a comprehensive lava flow hazard and risk assessment are needed.\nDuring a field campaign in January 2015, we collected Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and photogrammetric data. We construct a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from almost 165 million TLS data points, covering 87.7 % of the new lava flows and most of the Chã das Caldeiras. We use the photogrammetric data and the Structure from Motion (SfM) method to cover the remaining 12.3 % of the affected area. By combining the TLS and SfM datasets, we construct an updated and high-quality DEM, including details on the lava flow morphology and the 2014/2015 eruptive vent. We estimate the total erupted lava volume and area by subtracting a pre-eruptive from the post-eruptive DEM.\nBased on this dataset, we are able to assess the lava flow hazard by simulating possible lava flow paths using the DOWNFLOW probabilistic code. We use a pre-eruptive DEM to reconstruct the flow paths of the 2014/2015 eruption. The new post-eruptive DEM is used to forecast possible future lava flow paths. We combine the hazard map with information on existing infrastructure (i.e. roads and settlements) in order to estimate the lava flow risk. As a final result we provide up-to-date lava flow hazard and risk maps for Fogo Volcano, Cape Verde.",

            "abstract": "Ceres is famously the largest object in the asteroid belt. Over the course of the last 215 years it has been considered everything from a unique protoplanet (or indeed full-fledged “planet”) to a large but run-of-the-mill piece of rock. Over the last decade, models of Ceres’ thermal history and shape measurements based on HST imagery have led to the recognition that Ceres is a differentiated object, and likely an ice-rich one. In the last year the Dawn spacecraft has provided unprecedented views of Ceres’ surface and combined with data from observational facilities like Herschel and countless telescopes it has shown the varied nature of its geology and ongoing processes.\nEven given these recent results, Ceres remains an inhabitant of the asteroid belt, existing in the ambient environment and affected by impactors, micrometeorites, solar wind, and other factors. While we only have spacecraft imagery from a very small number of targets, we do have a wealth of Earth-based data from the objects that have shared space with Ceres for billions of years. The insights gained from studying these objects can be applied to Ceres to understand its context and nature. Similarly, what we learn at Ceres will be applicable in many ways to other objects, particularly the twenty or so largest asteroids, which tend to be low-albedo, water-rich bodies.\nI will discuss our current understanding of the asteroids, particularly those that share important characteristics with Ceres, and focus on what we can learn about Ceres from these bodies.",

            "abstract": "In the mountain West region the winter snowpack provides more than 70% of our annual water supply. Modeling and predicting the timing and magnitude of snowmelt-driven water yield is difficult due to the complexities of hydrologic systems that move meltwater from snow to rivers. Particular challenges are understanding the temporal and spatial domain of subsurface hydraulic processes at relevant scales, which range from points to catchments. Subsurface characterization often requires borehole instrumentation, which is expensive and extremely difficult to install in remote, rugged terrain. Advancements in non-invasive geophysical methods allow us to monitor changes in geophysical parameters over time and infer changes in hydraulic processes.\nIn the No-Name experimental catchment in the Medicine Bow National Forest in Wyoming, we are conducting a multi-season, time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging survey on a sub-alpine hill slope. This south-facing, partially forested slope ranges from 5 degrees to 35 degrees in steepness and consists of a soil mantle covering buried glacial talus deposits of unknown depth. A permanent grid of down-slope and cross-slope electrode arrays is monitored up to four times a day. The arrays span the entire vertical distance of the slope, from an exposed bedrock ridge to a seasonal drainage below, and cover treed and non-treed areas. Geophysical measurements are augmented by temperature and moisture time-series instrumented below the surface in a contiguous 3 meter borehole. A time-series of multiple resistivity models each day from May to July shows the changing distribution of subsurface moisture during a seasonal drying sequence punctuated by isolated rain events. Spatial patterns of changing moisture indicate that soil and gravel in the top two meters drain into a saturated layer parallel to the slope which overlies less saturated material. These results suggest that water from snowmelt and rain events tends to move down-slope beneath the surface in a saturated zone rather than over the surface.",

            "abstract": "Management of terrestrial carbon stocks in natural ecosystems has been proposed as a sustainable approach to counteracting the anthropogenic contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. One factor of uncertainty in carbon accounting is that a portion of carbon assumed to be sequestered in soils may in fact be transported to river networks. The primary objectives of this study are to: 1) determine if the magnitude of empirical estimates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export in rivers correlates with simulated soil DOC leachate values from terrestrial carbon models, and 2) quantify terrestrial loading of DOC to river networks across the conterminous US. We evaluated the magnitude of riverine DOC fluxes relative to carbon storage in terrestrial biomass and soils using the aggregated results from the terrestrial carbon models included in the LandCarbon and Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Projects. We also compared gridded terrestrial DOC leaching values to downstream DOC fluxes in rivers estimated by the USGS LOADEST model. Quantification of terrestrial-aquatic linkages is necessary to better evaluate ecosystem carbon sequestration as a potential tool for mitigating anthropogenic perturbance to the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Recent Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 observations of Saturn have provided a low-phase angle view of the planet that complements the higher phase angles and increased spatial resolution view from the Cassini spacecraft. HST orbits were perfectly timed for observing an atmospheric perturbation at polar latitudes that has been conspicuous on ground-based observations of the planet since May 2015. The observations serendipitously captured other interesting features at the Equatorial Zone (EZ) with Voyager-era fast speeds (see Sánchez-Lavega et al. abstract, this meeting). In this presentation we will discuss how the synergy between the Cassini/ISS and HST/WFC3 observations provides an excellent way for peeking into Saturn's atmosphere and analyze the vertical distribution and properties of the particles and aerosols located in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere of the planet. We first discuss how Cassini/ISS observations at a variety of phase angles constrain particle properties and phase functions, in particular at the Equatorial Zone where they resemble 100 micron ammonia ice crystals. With this information, it is possible to use the HST/WFC3 observations at 10 filters from near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared provide substantial information on the vertical cloud structure and composition: the filters in and out of the intermediate and deep methane bands at the near infrared give information on particle number density around the tropopause level and down to the ammonia condensation level, while near-ultraviolet and blue filters characterize the absorption of unknown chromophores in Saturn's atmosphere. Fast-moving features in the EZ are found to be located deeper (> 2 bar) than the features used for cloud-tracking since the pre-Cassini era (< 1 bar). This provides an unprecedented view of the EZ vertical wind shear by sounding simultaneously three separate atmospheric levels. Finally, results for Saturn's Northern hemisphere will also be showed.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions have been investigated extensively but still remain high uncertainty due to the complexity of cloud microphysical processes under various dynamic and thermodynamic environments. Cloud-resolving Weather Research and Forecast (CR-WRF) model implemented with a two-moment bulk microphysics and a modified Goddard radiation scheme is employed to investigate aerosol effects on different cloud regimes and their transitions associated with a continental cloud system occurring from 25 May to 27 May, 2009 during the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Routine AAF Clouds with Low Optical Water Depths Optical Radiative Observations (RACORO) field campaign. The simulated cloud properties and precipitation for the three different cloud regimes, including shallow cumuli, a deep convective cloud (DCC), and a stratus exhibit overall agreements with airborne and ground-based observations. Sensitivity studies with different aerosol scenarios reveal that the responses of cloud micro- and macrophysics to aerosol loading depend on the cloud regimes with monotonic or non-monotonic trend. Aerosol radiative effects modify the atmospheric thermodynamic condition and change the atmospheric stability, which induce different response from aerosol indirect effects. Our results also indicate that the overall aerosol effects on a cloud complex are distinct from those of the individual cloud types. The aerosol-cloud interaction for the different cloud regimes should be evaluated to assess the aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcings on regional and global climate.",

            "abstract": "During the Hew Horizons flyby of Jupiter, the spacecraft crossed near 32 RJ on the dusk side before traveling down the Jovian magnetotail. During the period when the spacecraft was in the mid-magnetosphere (<50 RJ), the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument observed two distinct ion populations. The first was the low energy tail of a hotter population of magnetospheric ions. The second population had a lower energy, ~ 30 eV / q in the spacecraft frame. SWAP measures the differential ion flux for particles as a function of energy per charge of between ~20 eV / q to ~8 keV / q, integrated over a wide field of view. The SWAP instrument can also estimate the mass of the ions based on the detector response. For the Jovian flyby, heavy ions (> 8 amu) are only observed by SWAP in the second lower energy (30 eV / q) population seen in the mid-magnetosphere. Here we present the observations of the SWAP instrument during its closest approach of Jupiter and discuss these two ion populations.",

            "abstract": "Climate change in the northeastern United States is expected to shift climatic (temperature) envelopes for spruce-fir forests upslope and northward decreasing their area in the region by 2100. Coarse scale landscape models however, may not incorporate heterogeneity in climatic conditions in mountains that can create climatic refugia for species in high-elevation spruce-fir forests. To determine spatial and temporal trends in climate of mountain spruce-fir forests we measured microclimate at 98 forest plots in 2012 and 2013 on 12 mountains in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. By linking regional climate trends with our spatial climate data we calculated elevational shifts in temperature envelopes during the last 50 years. Additionally we linked our spatial dataset to a range of future climate conditions for 2100 based on Representative Concentration Pathways (1 to 5°C warming). We hypothesized that climates have already changed to an extent that spruce-fir forests should begin to respond and that future climate conditions may shift suitable habitat for spruce-fir forests beyond their current range. We found that regional climate change over the last 50 years has resulted in warming of 0.66 and 1.62°C for average annual daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures in the region. When linked to our spatial microclimate model, this warming results in a 100 (Tmax) and 312m (Tmin) upslope shift in temperature envelopes. Future climate projections suggest that by 2100 Tmax may shift upslope between 152 and 758m for the 1 and 5°C scenarios respectively, while Tmin may shift upslope between 192 and 962m. Spruce-fir forests typically occupy an elevation range of ~500m suggesting that the climate experienced in these forests 50 years ago may not be found within their elevation range by 2100. These results are discussed in the context of responses of tree populations and growth rates observed along the elevation gradients of northeastern United States.",

            "abstract": "Spatial patterning occurs in a variety of ecosystems, and is important for the functional properties of landscapes; for testing spatial models of ecological processes; and as an indicator of landscape condition and resilience. Theory suggests that regular patterns arise from coupled local- and landscape-scale feedbacks that can also create multiple stable landscape states. In the Florida Everglades, hydrologic modification has degraded much of the historically-extensive ridge-slough landscape, a patterned peatland mosaic with distinct, flow-parallel patches. However, in the Everglades and in general, the hypothesis that patterned landscapes have homogeneous alternative states has little direct empirical support. Here we use microtopographic and vegetative heterogeneity, and their relation to hydrologic conditions, to infer the existence of multiple landscape equilibria and identify the hydrologic thresholds for critical transitions between these states. Dual relationships between elevation variance and water depth, and bi-modal distributions of both elevation variance and plant community distinctness, are consistent with generic predictions of multiple states, and covariation between these measures suggests that microtopography is the leading indicator of landscape degradation. Furthermore, a simple ecohydrologic multiple-state model correctly predicts the hydrologic thresholds for persistence of distinct ridges and sloughs. Predicted ridge-slough elevation differences and their relation to water depth are much greater than observed in the contemporary Everglades, but correspond closely with historical observations of pre-drainage conditions. These multiple lines of evidence represent the broadest and most direct support for the link between regular spatial pattern and landscape-scale alternative states in any ecosystem, and suggest that other patterned landscapes could undergo sudden collapse in response to changing environmental conditions. Hydrologic thresholds and leading indicators of critical transitions should guide management of the Everglades ridge-slough landscape, whose preservation is a central goal of one of the world's largest ecosystem restoration efforts.

The second generation CMORPH is built upon the Kalman Filter based CMORPH algorithm of Joyce and Xie (2011). Inputs to the system include rainfall and snowfall rate retrievals from passive microwave (PMW) measurements aboard all available low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, precipitation estimates derived from infrared (IR) observations of geostationary (GEO) as well as LEO platforms, and precipitation simulations from numerical global models. Key to the success of the 2nd generation CMORPH, among a couple of other elements, are the development of a LEO-IR based precipitation estimation to fill in the polar gaps and objectively analyzed cloud motion vectors to capture the cloud movements of various spatial scales over the entire globe.\nThe prototype algorithm for the LEO IR precipitation estimation is refined to achieve improved quantitative accuracy and consistency with PMW retrievals. AVHRR IR TBB data from all LEO satellites are first remapped to a 0.05olat/lon grid over the entire globe and in a 30-min interval. AVHRR TBB - precipitation relationships are separately established through PDF calibration of the TBB data against temporally/spatially collocated combined PMW retrievals (MWCOMB) and against the CloudSat radar measurements, respectively, then combined using a weighted mean to reflect the strengths of both data sources.\nA sub-system is developed to construct analyzed fields of cloud motion vectors from the GEO/LEO IR based precipitation estimates and the CFS Reanalysis (CFSR) precipitation fields. Motion vectors are first derived separately from the satellite IR based precipitation estimates and the CFSR precipitation fields. These individually derived motion vectors are then combined through a 2D-VAR technique to form an analyzed field of cloud motion vectors over the entire globe. Error functions are developed to best reflect the performance of the satellite IR based estimates and the CFSR in capturing the movements of precipitating cloud systems over different regions and for different seasons.",

We also conducted automated measurements of gaseous Hg in soil pores and snow interstitial air to quantify gas exchange between soils, snow, and the atmosphere; and characterized wet and dry deposition and plant-derived Hg inputs. Results show that atmospheric Hg concentrations peak in winter, decrease in spring, and show summertime minima. Oxidized atmospheric Hg was below detection limits (0.05 ng m-3) indicating no significant dry deposition. Summertime minima of atmospheric Hg concentrations were associated with depositional fluxes of gaseous Hg (up to 2.8 ng m-2 hr-1; measured by a gradient method) that emerged after complete snowmelt. In contrast, gaseous Hg fluxes were below detection limits when snowpack was present; this was supported by in situ snowpack measurements and in contrast to commonly observed gaseous emissions from temperate snowpacks. The cumulative annual gaseous deposition flux of mercury was 12 µg m-2, in similar range as plant-derived inputs (17 µg m-2 yr-1) which we consider the major reason for observed gaseous Hg sink. Wet deposition was extremely low (<1 µg m-2 yr−1) compared to other sites.\nHg concentrations in plants and soils are similar to levels found at temperate sites, but terrestrial pool sizes are large in comparison ranging around 400 g ha-1. The results suggest that: atmospheric Hg exposure is low at this site; that deposition is dominated by plant-derived deposition; and that significant Hg pools accumulate in tundra soils, likely driven by strong retention and low re-emissions after deposition. The high Hg soil pool sizes and key role of plant-productivity for Hg deposition may indicate a high sensitivity to climate change, in particular to permafrost soil thawing and increased growing season length.",

No field evidence of these tsunamis are found in the vincity of the sources. Such a scenario taking place nowadays would trigger hazardous tsunami waves bearing potentially catastrophic consequences for the closest islands and regional offshore oil platforms.\nHere we applied a complete hazard assessment method on the only active submarine volcano of the arc Kick ’em Jenny (KeJ). KeJ is the southernmost edifice with recognized associated volcanic landslide deposits. From the three identified landslide episodes one is associated with a collapse volume ca. 4.4 km3. Numerical simulations considering a single pulse collapse revealed that this episode would have produced a regional tsunami. An edifice current volume estimate is ca. 1.5 km3.\nPrevious study exists in relationship to assessment of regional tsunami hazard related to shoreline surface elevation (run-up) in the case of a potential flank collapse scenario at KeJ. However this assessment was based on inferred volume of collapse material. We aim to firstly quantify potential initial volumes of collapse material using relative slope instability analysis (RSIA); secondly to assess first order run-ups and maximum inland inundation distance for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, i.e. two important economic centers of the Lesser Antilles. In this framework we present for seven geomechanical models tested in the RSIA step maps of critical failure surface associated with factor of stability (Fs) for twelve sectors of 30° each; then we introduce maps of expected potential run-ups\n(run-up × the probability of failure at a sector) at the shoreline.\nThe RSIA evaluates critical potential failure surface associated with Fs <1 as compared to areas of deficit/surplus of mass/volume identified on the volcanic edifice using (VolcanoFit 2.0 & SSAP 4.5). Tsunami sources characteristics are retrieved from numerical simulation using an hydraulic equations-based code (VolcFlow-Matlab). The tsunami propagation towards the coasts is computed using the open source a Boussinesq equations-based code (FUNWAVE) taking into account high order non linear effects including dissipation.",

            "abstract": "Since its initial development over 30 years ago, the Hydrologic Simulation Program – FORTAN (HSPF) model has been used worldwide to support water quality planning and management. In the United States, HSPF receives widespread endorsement as a regulatory tool at all levels of government and is a core component of the EPA’s Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) system, which was developed to support nationwide Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) analysis. However, the model’s legacy code and data management systems have limitations in their ability to integrate with modern software, hardware, and leverage parallel computing, which have left voids in optimization, pre-, and post-processing tools. Advances in technology and our scientific understanding of environmental processes that have occurred over the last 30 years mandate that upgrades be made to HSPF to allow it to evolve and continue to be a premiere tool for water resource planners. This work aims to mitigate the challenges currently facing HSPF through two primary tasks: (1) convert code to a modern widely accepted, open-source, high-performance computing (hpc) code; and (2) convert model input and output files to modern widely accepted, open-source, data model, library, and binary file format. Python was chosen as the new language for the code conversion. It is an interpreted, object-oriented, hpc code with dynamic semantics that has become one of the most popular open-source languages. While python code execution can be slow compared to compiled, statically typed programming languages, such as C and FORTRAN, the integration of Numba (a just-in-time specializing compiler) has allowed this challenge to be overcome. For the legacy model data management conversion, HDF5 was chosen to store the model input and output. The code conversion for HSPF’s hydrologic and hydraulic modules has been completed. The converted code has been tested against HSPF's suite of \"test\" runs and shown good agreement and similar execution times while using the Numba compiler. Continued verification of the accuracy of the converted code against more complex legacy applications and improvement upon execution times by incorporating an intelligent network change detection tool is currently underway, and preliminary results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Vigorous discussions and disagreements about the future changes in drought intensity in the US Great Plains have been taking place recently within the literature. These discussions have involved widely varying estimates based on drought indices and model-based projections of the future. To investigate and understand the causes for such a disparity between these previous estimates, we analyzed 10 commonly-used drought indexes using the output from 26 state-of-the-art climate models. These drought indices were computed using potential evapotranspiration estimated by the physically-based Penman-Monteith method (PE_pm) and the empirically-based Thornthwaite method (PE_th). The results showed that the short-term drought indicators are similar to modeled surface soil moisture and show a small but consistent drying trend in the future. The long-term drought indicators and the total column soil moisture, however, are consistent in projecting more intense future drought. When normalized, the drought indices with PE_th all show unprecedented and possibly unrealistic future drying, while the drought indices with PE_pm show comparable dryness with the modeled soil moisture. Additionally, the drought indices with PE_pm are closely related to soil moisture during both the 20th and 21st Centuries. Overall, the drought indices with PE_pm, as well as the modeled total column soil moisture, suggest a widespread and very significant drying of the Great Plains region toward the end of the Century. Our results suggested that the sharp contracts about future drought risk in the Great Plains discussed in previous studies are caused by 1) comparing the projected changes in short-term droughts with that of the long-term droughts, and/or 2) computing the atmospheric evaporative demand using the empirically-based method (e.g., PE_th). Our analysis may be applied for drought projections in other regions across the globe.",

            "abstract": "Magma-mixing is a key process that controls mass transfer in magmatic systems. The variations in melt compositions near the magma-magma interface potentially change the Fe oxidation state [1] and, thus, affect the solubility and transport of metals. To test this hypothesis, diffusion-couple experiments were performed at 1000 °C, 150 MPa and QFM+4. Synthesized crystal-bearing cylinders of hydrous dacite and hydrous basaltic andesite were equilibrated for up to 80 h.\nThe run products show that mafic components (Fe, Mg, etc.) were transported from the andesite into the dacite, while Si, Na and K diffused from the dacite into the andesite. A crystal dissolution sequence in the order of cpx, opx, plag, and spl/il was observed for the andesite.\nWe combined µ-XANES spectroscopy at Fe K-edge [2] with two-oxide oxybarometry [3] to measure redox profiles within our experiments. Here, fO2 decreased towards the interface within the dacite and increased towards the interface within the andesite. This discontinuous fO2 evolution, with a sharp redox gradient of ~1.8 log fO2 units at the interface was maintained throughout the time-series despite the externally imposed fO2 of the vessel. We propose a combination of two mechanisms that create and sustain this redox gradient: 1) The dissolution of cpx and opx in the andesite mainly introduced Fe2+ into the melt, which diffused towards the dacite, lowering Fe3+/SFe near the interface. 2) Charge balance calculations in the melt during diffusive exchange suggest net positive charge excess in the andesite near the interface (i.e., oxidation) and net negative charge excess in the dacite near the interface (i.e., reduction).\nWe suggest that this (metastable) redox layer can help to explain the contrasting Au/Cu ratios observed for arc-related porphyry-type ore deposits.\n[1] Moretti (2005), Ann.

            "abstract": "Intact tropical forests contain substantial amount of carbon (C) and play an important role in global carbon cycles. Field measurement is needed to quantify dead organic matter (DOM) C dynamics in tropical forests while it requires much labor and cost. In contrast, forest carbon models can simulate C dynamics, overcoming the limitation of field measurement. In this study, we simulated the DOM C dynamics of an intact mixed dipterocarp forest at Kuala Belalong in Brunei, by using a forest carbon model. In order to estimate the annual changes in the C stocks of litter layer, dead root, coarse woody debris (CWD), and soils, a forest carbon model, KFSC model, was parameterized to the study site. In order to initialize the KFSC model, the C stocks in biomass, litter layer, CWD, and soils were measured in twenty seven 20 m x 20 m plots in 2014. The measured C stocks (Mg C ha-1) in litter layer, dead root, CWD, and soils were 3.2 ± 0.5, 4.0 ± 1.9, 32.5 ± 38.9, and 75.2 ± 9.2, respectively. The simulation results showed that the annual changes in the C stocks (Mg C ha‑1 yr-1) of litter layer, dead root, CWD, and soils were 2.7 ± 2.0, 1.4 ± 1.8, -1.5 ± 7.7, and 0.5 ± 1.8, respectively. The total DOM C stocks tended to increase at the rate of 3.3 ± 9.6 Mg C ha‑1 yr-1, but it exhibited the high variation. This might be attributed to the high variation of the annual changes in the CWD C stocks. Our results exhibited the applicability of forest carbon models to quantify DOM C dynamics in intact tropical rain forests.",

            "abstract": "Large amounts of Carbon Monoxide (CO) are emitted during biomass burning events. These emissions severely perturb the atmospheric composition. For this reason, satellite observations of CO can help to constrain emissions from biomass burning. Other sources of CO, such as the production of CO from naturally emitted non-methane hydrocarbons, may interfere with CO from biomass burning and inverse modeling efforts to estimate biomass burning emissions have to account for these CO sources.\nThe atmospheric lifetime of CO varies from weeks to months, depending on the availability of atmospheric OH for atmospheric oxidation of CO to carbon dioxide. This means that CO can be transported over relatively long distances. It also implies that satellite-observed CO does not necessarily originate from the underlying continent, but may be caused by distant emissions transported to the observation location.\nIn this presentation we focus on biomass burning emissions from South America and Southern Africa during 2010. This year was particularly dry over South America with a large positive anomaly in biomass burning in the 2010 burning season (July-October). We will adress the question how CO plumes from South America biomass burning influence satellite observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument over Southern Africa. For this we employ the TM5 atmospheric chemistry model, with 1x1 degree zoom resolutions over Africa and South America. Also, we use the TM5-4DVAR code to estimate CO biomass burning emissions using IASI CO observations.\nThe accompanying image shows IASI CO oberservations over Africa on August 27, 2010, compared to the columns simulated with TM5. Clear signs of intercontinental transport from South America are visible over the Southermost region.",

            "abstract": "Energy and water are precious resources, and they are interconnected. The energy sector uses a lot of water -- the thermoelectric power sector alone is the largest user of water in the U.S., withdrawing 200 billion gallons daily for powerplant cooling. Conversely, the water sector is responsible for over twelve percent of national energy consumption for moving, pumping, treating, and heating water. This interdependence means that droughts can cause energy shortages, and power outages can bring the water system to a halt. It also means that water efficiency is a pathway to energy efficiency and vice versa. This talk will give a big-picture overview of global energy and water trends to describe how they interact, what conflicts are looming, and how they can work together. This talk will include the vulnerabilities and cross-cutting solutions such as efficient markets and smart technologies that embed more information about resource management. It will include discussion of how population growth, economic growth, climate change, and short-sighted policies are likely to make things worse. Yet, more integrated planning with long-term sustainability in mind along with cultural shifts, advanced technologies, and better design can avert such a daunting future. Combining anecdotes and personal stories with insights into the latest science of energy and water, this talk will identify a hopeful path toward wise, long-range water-energy decisions and a more reliable and abundant future for humanity.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers, narrow plumes of anomalously high tropospheric water vapor transport, frequently appear over the Pacific Ocean. Popularized by colloquialisms such as the “Pineapple Express,” atmospheric rivers often interact with synoptic-scale disturbances to produce significant precipitation events over land masses. Previous research has focused extensively on the impacts of this phenomenon with respect to high-precipitation storms, namely during boreal winter, on the western coast of the contiguous United States. These events generate great scientific, political, and economic concerns for nearby cities, farms, and tourist destinations. Recently, researchers have investigated similar high-precipitation events along the southern coast of Alaska. Specifically, previous work has discussed several major events occurring during the September-November timeframe. One particular event, in October 2006, produced an all-time record for water levels at several river observation sites.\nThis study examines the climatology of atmospheric rivers in the vicinity of southern Alaska. Data (1979-2014) from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is used to detect atmospheric rivers approaching, and making landfall on, the southern Alaskan coast from the Kenai Peninsula to the Gulf of Alaska region. A seasonal cycle in the strength and frequency of atmospheric rivers over Alaska is shown. Furthermore, the study assesses the synoptic conditions coincident with atmospheric rivers and examines several instances of particularly strong precipitation events. For example, wintertime atmospheric river events tend to occur when a blocking high exists over southeastern Alaska. These results have the potential to help forecasters and emergency managers predict high-precipitation events and lessen potential negative impacts. ",

            "abstract": "The theoretical foundations of recovering body wave energy via seismic interferometry are well established. However in practice, such recovery remains problematic. Here, synthetic seismograms computed for subsurface sources are used to evaluate the geometrical combinations of realistic ambient source and receiver distributions that result in useful recovery of virtual body waves. This study illustrates how surface receiver arrays that span a limited distribution suite of sources, can be processed to reproduce virtual shot gathers that result in CMP gathers which can be effectively stacked with traditional normal moveout corrections. To verify the feasibility of the approach in practice, seismic recordings of 50 aftershocks following the magnitude of 5.8 Virginia earthquake occurred in August, 2011 have been processed using seismic interferometry to produce seismic reflection images of the crustal structure above and beneath the aftershock cluster. Although monotonic noise proved to be problematic by significantly reducing the number of usable recordings, the edited dataset resulted in stacked seismic sections characterized by coherent reflections that resemble those seen on a nearby conventional reflection survey. In particular, “virtual\" reflections at travel times of 3 to 4 seconds suggest reflector sat approximately 7 to 12 km depth that would seem to correspond to imbricate thrust structures formed during the Appalachian orogeny. The approach described here represents a promising new means of body wave imaging of 3D structure that can be applied to a wide array of geologic and energy problems. Unlike other imaging techniques using natural sources, this technique does not require precise source locations or times. It can thus exploit aftershocks too small for conventional analyses. This method can be applied to any type of microseismic cloud, whether tectonic, volcanic or man-made.",

            "abstract": "Over the past five years, remote spectral investigations of ice-free Antarctic geology have become possible through improvements to atmospheric correction techniques and detailed laboratory- and field-based spectral validation. These investigations have provided new insight into the primary (inherent lithologic variability) and secondary (chemical weathering and surface alteration processes) geologic processes that have occurred across the Antarctic continent. While largely limited to familiar areas that have been thoroughly investigated in the field, such ground validation is possible through analyzing well-documented samples returned by previous investigators. This work also provides the first critical steps towards examining the nature of atmospheric contributions to orbital data across the Antarctic continent and developing a means of effectively removing their contributions.\nIn close collaboration with the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) and the Polar Rock Repository (PRR), we have begun collecting and archiving visible and near-infrared (0.35 – 2.50 microns) hyperspectral data of samples currently archived at the PRR. These samples include a range of clasts and sediments that span the full diversity of Antarctic geology. As they are collected, these data are shared and archived at both the PGC and PRR, and will soon be incorporated into the PRR digital data archive that accompanies all lithologic samples.\nWe will report on the progress of this investigation, including preliminary associations between the laboratory-derived spectra and high-resolution (meter-scale) orbital data from the PGC. These investigations suggest that first-order atmospheric removal and compositional investigations can be performed remotely for areas where samples have been collected and analyzed. Future work will continue to expand the geographic range of analyzed samples, particularly along the Antarctic coast.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA Earth Information System (NEIS) developed by NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) is a framework providing real-time high performance data discovery, access, and visualization. Along with a ESRL’s unique visualization client, TerraViz, this framework provides seamless visualization and integration of data across time and space regardless of data size, physical location, or data format.\nAn enabling technology is the services behind the scenes. The NEIS team has continued research into improving the asynchronous, event driven architecture which supports and drives the performance of the framework. Services are continually evaluated and broken down into smaller, more modular, self contained components. The benefits have been numerous. Through this effort the NEIS team has improved many aspects of the overall framework including performance, fault tolerance, testing coverage, scalability, reliability, and agility.\nThis modular service approach provides the capability to monitor and pinpoint bottlenecks within the framework. Depending on the impact, the service can either be improved or scaled up to meet the requirements. Additionally, the modular nature reduces coupling between various components of the framework allowing individual services to be upgraded without taking down the entire system, decreasing the overall time to respond and fix to problems.\nThis talk will focus on our approach to developing these services to support the NEIS framework and TerraViz, along with discussion on findings, challenges, and future research.",

            "abstract": "The nonhydrostatic global Model for Prediction Across Scale (MPAS) was used to simulate the November MJO event during the DYNAMO field campaign. Three mesh configurations were used: two with global uniform 60 km and 15 km grid spacing, respectively, and one with a 3 km grid spacing over the tropical Indian Ocean and 50 km for the rest of the world (50/3). The two cumulus parameterization schemes used in this study, Tiedtke and Grell-Freitas (GF), both include separated deep and shallow schemes that can be turned on and off individually. The GF scheme is scale aware. The Single Moment 6-class (WSM6) microphysics scheme was used. MPAS reproduced the MJO event with various degrees of success when the two cumulus schemes and their deep and shallow components were turned on and off. Microphysics and shallow convection each would help to reproduce MJO signals, with greater success at the 50/3 km mesh than 15 km. A deep cumulus scheme, on the other hand, may help or ruin MJO signals produced by microphysics and shallow schemes. The role of shallow convection is to provide moisture in the lower troposphere to reduce dry biases in the model and, in consequence, increase total precipitation. The capability of the model to produce MJO signals does not depend on the mean vertical profiles of diabatic heating profile, but are sensitive to mean vertical profiles of the moisture sink, which vary evidently with the shallow cumulus scheme.",

            "abstract": "The spatial and temporal variations in water turbidity are of great interest for the study of fluvial and coastal environments; and for predicting the performance of remote sensing systems that are used to map these. Conventional water turbidity estimates from remote sensing observations have normally been derived using near infrared reflectance. We have investigated the potential of determining water turbidity from additional remote sensing sources, namely airborne hyperspectral imagery and single wavelength bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).\nThe confluence area of the Blue and Colorado River, CO was utilized as a study area to investigate the capabilities of both airborne bathymetric LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery for water turbidity estimation. Discrete and full waveform bathymetric data were collected using Optech’s Gemini (1064 nm) and Aquarius (532 nm) LiDAR sensors. Hyperspectral imagery (1.2 m pixel resolution and 72 spectral bands) was acquired using an ITRES CASI-1500 imaging system. As an independent reference, measurements of turbidity were collected concurrent with the airborne remote sensing acquisitions, using a WET Labs EcoTriplet deployed from a kayak and turbidity was then derived from the measured backscatter.\nThe bathymetric full waveform dataset contains a discretized sample of the full backscatter of water column and benthic layer. Therefore, the full waveform records encapsulate the water column characteristics of turbidity. A nonparametric support vector regression method is utilized to estimate water turbidity from both hyperspectral imagery and voxelized full waveform LiDAR returns, both individually and as a fused dataset. Results of all the evaluations will be presented, showing an initial turbidity prediction accuracy of approximately 1.0 NTU. We will also discuss our future strategy for enhanced fusion of the full waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery for improved turbidity estimation.",

            "abstract": "Convection-related data constrain lower-mantle density anomalies that contribute to mantle convective flow. These include global gravity and topography anomalies, plate motions and excess ellipticity of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Each datum possesses differing wavelength and depth dependent resolution of heterogeneity and thus the strongest constraints on density anomalies are obtained by jointly inverting all data in combination. The joint-inversions employ viscous response functions (i.e. geodynamic kernels) for a flowing mantle. Non-uniqueness is greatly reduced by including seismic and mineral physics data into the joint inversions. We present the results of inversions where seismic and geodynamic data are singly and jointly inverted to map density anomalies. Employing mineral physical data we estimate thermal and compositional contributions to density anomalies. We evaluate the extent to which \"Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces\" (LLSVP) are anomalous and we determine their impact on the global pattern of convective flow. The inversions yield consistent maps of lower-mantle flow (see figure) that are dominated by two large upwellings, under the Western Pacific (next to the Caroline microplate) and Eastern Pacific (under the East Pacific Rise). These hot upwellings effectively delimit the margins of the Pacific LLSVP, suggesting intrinsic negative buoyancy within this structure impedes large-scale upwellings in the mantle above. These two upwellings do not resemble classical mantle \"plumes\" found in simple isoviscous and isochemical convection models but their contribution to mass and heat transport across the lower mantle is significant and thus behave similarly to plumes. The large scale of these upwellings may be understood in terms of the high viscosity in the lower mantle, inferred from geodynamic constraints on mantle rheology. Very-long time convection simulations initiated with present-day structure inferred from these inversions show the two Pacific upwellings possess remarkable geographic fixity and longevity extending over several hundred million years, again a consequence of the high viscosity in the lower mantle. These upwellings are fed by large heat flux across the CMB (from 12 to 20 TW) and should play a major role in the thermal evolution of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "A key assumption of two source energy balance models is that the effective source/sink for turbulent flux exchange at the surface and the entire canopy/soil is described by a bulk surface/canopy/soil temperature and resistance. Therefore, the spatial resolution of radiometric surface/canopy/soil temperature (TRAD) used as an input to these models and how well they agreed with this “bulk” concept influence the final estimations. In complex ecosystems, with more than two layers of vegetation, bare soil and heterogeneous distribution patterns, the representativeness of the sensor average temperature and the up-scaling of the ecosystem structural vegetation characteristics will be more crucial for the precision of the results than in more homogeneous landscapes. The aim of this study is to analyze the scale-effects derived from TSEB application, comparing the observed energy fluxes and the estimated ones obtained from multiple TRAD data sources of different nature (tree/grass/soil ground-based observations, tower footprint and low and medium satellite TRAD) and how the up-scaling of the vegetation characteristics contribute to the discrepancies. The area selected for this purpose is a savanna type FLUXNET site (Tonzi ranch, CA, US). These ecosystems present canopy mosaics that differ in phenology, physiology and functioning, and bare soil, all of them influencing the turbulent and radiative exchanges.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas, and the predominant source of natural atmospheric CH4 globally is its production in wetland soils. Wetlands and marshes in the southeastern U.S. comprise over 40 million acres of land and thus represent a significant component of the global climate system. CH4 contributions from these and other subtropical systems remain difficult to quantify, however. Existing field measurements are lacking in both spatial and temporal coverage, inhibiting efforts to produce regional estimates through upscaling. Top-down constraints on emissions have been generated using satellite remote sensing retrievals of column CH4 (e.g., Frankenberg et al., 2005, 2008, Bergamaschi et al., 2007, 2013, Bloom et al., 2010, Wecht et al., 2014), but such approaches typically require preexisting emissions estimates to discern individual source contributions.\nLand Surface Models (LSMs) have the potential to produce realistic results, but such predictions rely on accurate representations of sub-grid scale processes responsible for emissions. Since net fluxes are governed by complex interactions between local environmental and biogeochemical factors including water table position, soil temperature, soil substrate availability and vegetation type, reliable flux simulations depend not only upon how such processes are resolved but how skillfully the land surface state itself is predicted by a given model.\nHere, we examine simulations using CLM4Me, a CH4 biogeochemistry model run within CESM, and compare results to recently compiled flux estimations from satellite remote sensing data. We then examine how seasonal CH4 flux simulations in CLM4Me are affected by alternative parameterizations of inundated land fraction. A global inundation dataset is calculated using DYPTOP, a newly-developed TOPMODEL implementation specifically designed to simulate the dynamics of wetland spatial distribution. We find evidence that DYPTOP may improve wetland CH4 flux predictions over subtropical regions in CLM4.5, and propose a computationally efficient framework for fine-scale tuning of this scheme to more accurately represent the role of subtropical and temperate wetlands in global climate projections.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical and geophysical studies have shown that >40% of the world’s mantle plumes are currently interacting with the global ridge system and such interactions may continue for up to 180 Myr[1]. At sites of plume-ridge interaction up to 1400 km of the spreading centre is influenced by dispersed plume material but there are few constraints on how and where the ridge-ward transfer of deep-sourced material occurs, and also how it is sustained over long time intervals. Galápagos is an archetypal example of an off-axis plume and sheds important light on these mechanisms. The Galápagos plume stem is located ~200 km south of the spreading axis and its head influences 1000 km of the ridge. Nevertheless, the site of enriched basalts, greatest crustal thickness and elevated topography on the ridge, together with active volcanism in the archipelago, correlate with a narrow zone (~150 km) of low-velocity, high-temperature mantle that connects the plume stem and ridge at depths of ~100 km[2]. The enriched ridge basalts contain a greater amount of partially-dehydrated, recycled oceanic crust than basalts elsewhere on the spreading axis, or indeed basalts erupted in the region between the plume stem and ridge. The presence of these relatively volatile-rich ridge basalts requires flow of plume material below the peridotite solidus (i.e.>80 km).\nWe propose a 2-stage model for the development and sustainment of a confined zone of deep ridge-ward plume flow. This involves initial on-axis capture and establishment of a sub-ridge channel of plume flow. Subsequent anchoring of the plume stem to a contact point on the ridge during axis migration results in confined ridge-ward flow of plume material via a deep network of melt channels embedded in the normal spreading and advection of the plume head[2]. Importantly, sub-ridge flow is maintained. The physical parameters and styles of mantle flow we have defined for Galápagos are less-well known at other sites of plume-ridge interactions, e.g. Tristan, Amsterdam. The observations require a more dynamically complex model than proposed by most studies, which rely on radial solid-state outflow of heterogeneous plume material to the ridge.\n[1] Whittaker JM et al (2015) Nature Geosci 10.1038/ngeo2437\n[2]Gibson SA, Geist DG & Richards MA (2015) Geochem Geophys Geosyst 10.1002/2015GC005723",

            "abstract": "This study aims to provide a mechanistic explanation of the empirical findings on the emergent patterns of streamflow intra-annual variability reported in a companion data-driven study across the contiguous United States. A mathematical extension of the Budyko formula with explicit accounts for the soil moisture storage change is introduced with a focus on the intra-annual variability of streamflow. The mathematical extension is then used to systematically examine the relative contributions of the intra-annual variability of precipitation, potential evaporative energy, soil water storage change and their co-variances. It is shown that, apart from aridity index whose importance has been recognized before, the variance of soil water storage change, its covariance with precipitation and the coupling of the seasonality in precipitation and potential evaporation are relatively more influential than the other factors. More importantly, the vital role of vegetation affecting streamflow intra-annual variability through regulating soil moisture storage is revealed under different climate conditions by using Leaf Area Index as an indicator of the above ground biomass directly and plant root system indirectly. In Mediterranean catchments where the water and energy cycles are out of phase, more persistent vegetation types (i.e. evergreen forests) are established with advanced root system to maximize the usage soil moisture. While in less humid catchments where precipitation and potential evaporation are more synchronous, recurrent vegetation types (i.e. deciduous forests, pastures) take over the dominance. Moreover, the two emerging classes in how vegetation correlates to the synchronism of EP and P suggest the recurring influence of aridity index: vegetation in arid catchments inclines to be more efficient in water usage to maintain a more persistent above ground gross production.",

Seismic reflection imaging technique, in contrast, can provide both lateral and vertical resolution of a few hundred meters, but has not been used for imaging deep structures, thus so far. In March-April 2015, we acquired over 2,750 km of ultra-deep seismic reflection data in the Atlantic Ocean. To image LAB variations as a function of age one of our profiles extends continuously starting from 75 Ma old oceanic lithosphere off the margin of Africa, crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at zero age, to up to 25 Ma old South America lithosphere. To image large differences in the LAB depth we also cross three major fracture zones in the equatorial Atlantic. For imaging deep structures, we used a very large energy source, 10,170 cubic inches, rich in low frequencies and a 12 km long multi-component streamer allowing to record low frequency energy reflected from deep earth and remove reverberation in the water column. Initial results show reflected seismic energy from 50-60 km depth. The seismic reflection experiment will be complemented by seismic refraction study to determine the crustal and upper mantle P-wave velocity, magnetotelluric study to determine resistivity, and broadband ocean bottom seismometer experiment for teleseismic study, collocated with our seismic reflection profiles. In this paper, we will present the design of the seismic reflection experiment and preliminary results from the onboard processed data.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is creating well-documented impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Among the best known of these impacts are changes to the growing season of temperate and boreal forests. Changes in phenology provide useful diagnostics of climate change impacts in these biomes, influence coupled biosphere-atmosphere interactions, and also affect regional-to-global carbon budgets. Extreme events and climate variability complicate the response of ecosystems and increase vulnerability by inducing large phenological responses that affect ecosystem function at seasonal (and longer) time scales. Studies using in-situ measurements have suggested that the growing season of temperate and boreal ecosystems is changing, and remote sensing-based research using time series imagery from coarse resolution sensors appear to confirm this trend. Specifically, studies using AVHRR NDVI data have documented changes in growing season NDVI that indicate widespread perturbations to boreal and temperate forests in response to climate change. However, the coarse spatial resolution and other limitations of AVHRR data constrain the types of inferences that can be drawn from these data. We describe research to address these challenges using Landsat data. Specifically, we use a new methodology that exploits dense time series of Landsat images to quantify spatio-temporal patterns in North American temperate and boreal forest growing season dynamics. Our methodology uses a sampling strategy designed to capture geographic variation in temperate and boreal forest properties, and focuses on regions of overlap between adjacent Landsat scenes, thereby significantly increasing the temporal sampling of Landsat images. Results from this research provide retrospective characterization of changes to temperate and boreal forest growing seasons spanning 30+ years at 30 m spatial resolution. In doing so, this research is (1) dramatically improving information about how temperate and boreal forests have changed in response to climate change, and (2) improving understanding regarding the sensitivity and vulnerability of these forests to climate change.

            "abstract": "Colombo faces recurrent floods that threaten its long-term economic development. Its urban wetlands have been identified by local agencies as a critical component of its flood reduction system, but they have declined rapidly in recent years due to continuous infilling, unmanaged land development and dredging to create lakes. In collaboration with government agencies, NGOs and local universities, the World Bank has carried out a Robust Decision Making analysis to examine the value of Colombo urban wetlands, both in the short-term and long-term, and identify what are the most viable strategies available to increase the city's flood resilience in an unclear future (in terms of climate change and patterns of urban development). This has involved the use of numerous hydrological and socio-economic scenarios as well as the evaluation of some wetlands benefits, like ecosystem services, wastewater treatment, or recreational services. The analysis has determined that if all urban wetlands across the Colombo catchment were lost, in some scenarios the metropolitan area would have to cope with an annual average flood loss of approximately 1% of Colombo GDP in the near future. For long-term strategies, trade-offs between urban development, lake creation and wetland conservation were analyzed and it was concluded that an active management of urban wetlands was the lowest regret option. Finally, the analysis also revealed that in the future, with climate change and fast urban development, wetlands will not be sufficient to protect Colombo against severe floods. Pro-active urban planning and land-use management are therefore necessary, both to protect existing wetlands and to reduce future exposure. The use of many different scenarios, the consideration of several policy options, and the open participatory process ensured policy-makers’ buy-in and lead to the decision to actively protect urban wetlands in Colombo.",

            "abstract": "CMORPH global high-resolution satellite precipitation estimates have been reprocessed and bias-corrected for an 18-year period from January 1998 to the present to cover the entire TRMM/GPM era. As the first step of this project, the CMORPH estimates have been reprocessed with a frozen algorithm and with input PMW retrievals and IR observations of identical versions throughout the data period.\nBias correction is then performed for the reprocessed CMORPH over the entire data period from 1998 to the present. Over land, the bias in the raw CMORPH is removed by matching the probability density function (PDF) of the CMORPH with that of the CPC unified daily gauge analysis. Over ocean, the raw CMORPH satellite estimates are calibrated against a long-term precipitation analysis (pentad GPCP) to ensure temporal homogeneity for climate applications. The reprocessed, bias-corrected CMORPH estimates present an 18-year homogeneous record of high-resolution precipitation on an 8kmx8km and 30-min resolution covering the globe from 60oS-60oN.\nAccuracy of the reprocessed, bias corrected CMORPH is examined through comparison against gauge based analysis over land and against buoy measurements over ocean. Overall, the bias corrected CMORPH exhibited improved performance upon the raw CMORPH, with bias removed almost completely over the tropics and extra-tropical regions during warm seasons. Caused by shortcomings in the input PMW retrievals, CMORPH tends to miss precipitation over cold surfaces. Quantitative accuracy of bias corrected CMORPH is a function of season, location, precipitation intensity, and the availability of satellite retrievals.\nBias corrected CMORPH is applied to examine the large-scale precipitation variations over the globe. In particular, diurnal variations of precipitation is investigated and compared with those determined by the three new generation reanalyses (CFSR, MERRA, and ERA-Interim). A comprehensive description and diagnostic discussions will be given at the AGU meetings.",

            "abstract": "Based on over a decade (2002-present) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity measurements, the results from southern Alaska indicate region-specific trends of annual ice mass loss and large variable seasonal mass fluctuations. Numerical modeling of the solid Earth response to cryosphere change on a variety of temporal and spatial scales plays a critical role in supporting the interpretation of time-variable gravity and other geodetic data in southern Alaska. Additionally, in this tectonically active region, the GRACE data are predicted to include ongoing mass change associated with seismic cycle processes including the viscoelastic response to the M 9.2 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake that influences our estimates of ice mass loss trends. Here, we highlight our results of numerical modeling of region specific contributing geophysical signals within the GRACE data. Our numerical modeling of the solid Earth response to cryosphere changes and earthquakes includes extrapolations of rock-mechanics based constitutive theories to the mantle and crustal rheology used in our regional finite element and global normal-mode modeling. With the longer time series provided by GRACE-GRACE-FO, and possibly enhanced spatial resolution of GRACE-FO and other future mission gravimetric data, we anticipate better characterization of the temporal and spatial nature of cryosphere-solid Earth interaction signals. These constraints will inform optimal strategies for exploiting gravimetric data from other tectonically active regions with cryosphere changes including Patagonia and Iceland.",

            "abstract": "The effects of environmental change are known to be temporally dynamic and better revealed in long-term studies, partly due to potential feedbacks associated with biogeochemical cycling and plant community composition. Rising air temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are the most pervasive facets of environmental change on land, yet multi-year, factorial studies of warming and elevated CO2 in intact ecosystems are exceedingly rare and the temporal dynamics of such studies have not been thoroughly reported. Here, we report an analysis of how experiment duration and yearly weather variability shaped the impacts of warming and CO2 on plant production, community composition, and biogeochemistry in a semiarid, North American grassland (near Cheyenne, Wyoming, U.S.A.). The experiment was a factorial manipulation of CO2 (ambient and 600 ppmv) and air temperature (ambient and warmed by 1.5°C during the day and 3°C during the night), maintained for 7 consecutive years using mini-FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) and infrared heaters (T-FACE). We will focus on two particular components of the apparent temporal dynamics. First, we will present how interannual variability in spring precipitation appears to cause related shifts in the effects of elevated CO2 on plant production (above and belowground) and the distribution of nitrogen in plants and soils. The results suggest that the effect of elevated CO2 on plant production could be limited by nitrogen, particularly in wet springs and in the absence of warming. Second, we will show how experiment duration appears to impact the response of various ecosystem attributes to the combined warming and elevated CO2 treatment on related ecosystem attributes. Specifically, we will discuss how potential feedbacks to water and nitrogen availability might be related to the shift from a positive effect of \"future conditions\" on C4 grasses to a positive effect of future conditions on C3 grasses.",

As no indicator alone able to quantify the quality of the soil and should relate various attributes. In this context, this study aimed to characterize soil quality in urban sub basins to the northwest of the city of Campinas / SP-Brazil. These are characterized by strong urbanization, with the presence of rural areas and fragmented native vegetation. Disturbed soil samples were collected along the area in which the parameters were analyzed: potential acidity, pH, organic matter, potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) base saturation (SB) and cation exchange capacity (CTC). Data were discussed by cluster analysis using Ward clustering strategy and using as the similarity coefficient between pairs Euclidean distance. Thus, one can divide the points collected from three different groups: Group 1 consists of 91% of the points belonging to the urban and rural use; group 2 showed about 73% of the points belonging to vegetated areas; Group 3 had 82% of points distributed between rural and vegetated areas. In terms of soil quality, it follows that on average the group 1 had the worst scores. Group 2 presented the best characteristics, except for K, higher in group 3, which can be attributed to chemical fertilizer used in agricultural areas. Knowing also that the acceptable limits for pH, in tropical soils vary between 5.5 and 6.8 is observed that the groups 2 and 3 were within this range, only the group 1 presented below this standard. In terms of soil quality indicators, group 2 stood out positively, with good quality, group 3 was between the two groups, with median values of quality, while the group 1 showed the most deterioration of the research group, It can be attributed to the fact that 54.5% of the points in this group have urban wear, indicating the need for recovery.",

            "abstract": "Negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) are commonly associated with extreme global warming. The Early Eocene is punctuated by five such CIEs, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, ca. 55.8 Ma), H1 (ca. 53.6 Ma), H2 (ca. 53.5 Ma), I1 (ca. 53.3 Ma), and I2 (ca. 53.2 Ma), each characterized by global warming. The negative CIEs are recognized in both marine and terrestrial substrates, but the terrestrial substrates exhibit a larger absolute magnitude CIE than the marine substrates. Here we reconcile the difference in CIE magnitude between the terrestrial and marine substrates for each of these events by accounting for the additional carbon isotope fractionation by C3 land plants in response to increased atmospheric pCO2. Our analysis yields background and peak pCO2 values for each of the events. Assuming a common mechanism for each event, we calculate that background pCO2 was not static across the Early Eocene, with the highest background pCO2 immediately prior to I2, the last of the five CIEs. Background pCO2 is dependent on the source used in our analysis with values ranging from 300 to 720 ppmv provided an injection of 13C-depleted carbon with δ13C value of -60‰ (e.g. biogenic methane). The peak pCO2 during each event scales according to the magnitude of CIE, and is therefore greatest during the PETM and smallest during H2. Both background and peak pCO2 are higher if we assume a mechanism of permafrost thawing (δ13C = -25‰). Our reconstruction of pCO2 across these events is consistent with trends in the δ18O value of deep-sea benthic foraminifera, suggesting a strong link between pCO2 and temperature during the Early Eocene.",

            "abstract": "Temperature profiling in the atmospheric boundary layer is essential in meteorological studies for understanding atmospheric processes. In this study, we developed a temperature lidar with a multispectral detector to construct a system that is compact, robust, and easy to align for the detection of rotational Raman signals. The multispectral lidar detector, which is based on a linear array multianode photomultiplier tube assembly, allows simultaneous detection of multiple spectrometer wavelengths. We can select a suitable observation wavelength using motorized accessory controls in spectroscopy and scanning software. The developed system enables the acquisition of shapes of rotational Raman spectra. Atmospheric temperature can be estimated by direct fitting of the observed lidar signals to the acquired theoretical shapes that exhibit different dependencies on temperature.\nIn the laser wavelength of the Raman lidar system, the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength has advantages over the visible wavelength because the rotational Raman backscatter coefficient is proportional to the minus fourth power of wavelength. Moreover, UV lidars achieve better daytime performances than visible systems because of reduced sky background. Here, we have developed two Raman lidar systems, which are equipped with lasers at wavelengths of 266 nm and355 nm. In the multispectral detector, the rotational Raman lidar signal has several uncertainties that cause significant errors during temperature estimation. For example, the light detection efficiency is not uniform for each channel in the multispectral detector. Here, we demonstrate the calibration techniques of the developed system and report the preliminary results of temperature observations in the planetary boundary layer at the middle and upper (MU) radar observatory (34.8°N, 136.1°E) in Shigaraki, Japan.",

Blended TPW has a wide variety of uses related to heavy precipitation and flooding, such as measuring the amount of moisture in an atmospheric river originating in the tropics. But blended TPW conveys no information on the vertical distribution of moisture, which is relevant to a variety of forecast concerns. Vertical profile information is particularly lacking over the oceans for landfalling storms.\nA blended six-satellite, four-layer, layered water vapor product demonstrated by CIRA and the NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition Center (SPoRT) in allows forecasters to see the vertical distribution of water vapor in near real-time. National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster feedback indicated that this new, vertically-resolved view of water vapor has a substantial impact on forecasts. This product uses NOAA investments in polar orbiting satellite sounding retrievals from passive microwave radiances, in particular, the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MIRS). The product currently utilizes data from the NOAA-18 and -19 spacecraft, Metop-A and –B, and the Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) F18 spacecraft. The sounding instruments onboard the Suomi-NPP and JPSS spacecraft will be cornerstone instruments in the future evolution of this product.\nApplications of the product to heavy rain cases will be presented and compared to commonly used data such as radiosondes and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) water vapor channel imagery. Research is currently beginning to implement advective blending, where model winds are used to move the water vapor profiles to a common time. Interactions with the NOAA Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) centers including the Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) and Weather Prediction Center (WPC) will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Snowfall is the major contributor to snow accumulation on glaciers and ice caps. Unfortunately, its quantification is rather difficult, both by observations and by numerical modelling. Field measurements of snowfall are generally problematic, and particularly inaccurate in mountainous regions. This holds true also for data from remote sensing systems like the TRMM. Numerical modelling of precipitation in general, and of snowfall in particular, is depending on parameterization of sub-grid processes occurring at a wide range of spatial scales. The scarcity of reliable observational data on snowfall required to test and validate the relevant parameterization schemes is one of the major obstacles for deepening our understanding of atmospheric controls of snow accumulation on glaciers and ice caps. In addition, the often made assumption that easy-to-measure snow accumulation equals snowfall is not valid in areas where other processes like snowdrift or avalanches cause snow deposition or erosion. Besides a general discussion of the above-mentioned problems, the presentation will focus on results obtained from a gridded atmospheric data set, i.e., the so-called High Asia Refined analysis (HAR), covering the study region by two nested domains of 30 km and 10 km grid spacing. Starting from autumn 2000, three-hourly (30 km) and hourly (10 km) data are available for a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables (see\nwww.klima.tu-berlin.de/HAR\n). HAR data was used to analyse annual and seasonal patterns of precipitation and atmospheric water transport, as well as to drive numerical models for surface mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets. A new study, which is the main subject of this presentation, reveals specific regimes of dynamic controls of precipitation in different regions of High Asia. One of the striking results is that the analysis identified a specific regime that is able to explain some of the atmospheric controls behind the so-called Karakoram anomaly (glaciers in this region show less negative or even positive mass balance than those in other regions), which has been highly debated in the scientific literature over the last years.",

The CHORDS Portal is a component that allows research teams to easily configure and operate a cloud-based service which can receive data from dispersed instruments, manage a rolling archive of the observations, and serve these data to any client on the Internet. The research group (user) creates a CHORDS portal simply by running a prepackaged “CHORDS appliance” on Amazon Web Services. The user has complete ownership and management of the portal. Computing expenses are typically very small.\nRESTful protocols are employed for delivering and fetching data from the portal, which means that any system capable of sending an HTTP GET message is capable of accessing the portal.

            "abstract": "General circulation models frequently suffer from a substantial cold bias in equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs). For instance, the majority of the climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) have this particular problem (17 out of the 26 models evaluated in this project). Our study investigates the extent to which these equatorial cold biases are related to mean climate biases generated in the extra-tropics and then communicated to the equator via the oceanic subtropical cells (STCs). With an evident relationship across the CMIP5 models between equatorial SSTs and upper ocean temperatures in the extra-tropical subduction regions, our analysis confirms that cold SST biases within the extra-tropical Pacific translate into a cold equatorial SST bias via the STCs. An assessment of the relationship between these extra-tropical SST biases and surface heat flux components indicates a link to biases in the simulated shortwave fluxes. Further sensitivity studies with a climate model (CESM) in which extra-tropical cloud albedo is systematically varied illustrate the influence of cloud albedo perturbations, not only directly above the oceanic subduction regions but across the extended extra-tropical Pacific, on the equatorial bias. The CESM experiments reveal a quadratic relationship between extra-tropical albedo and the root-mean-square-error in equatorial SSTs - a relationship with which the CMIP5 models generally agree. Thus, our study suggests that one way to improve the equatorial cold bias is to improve the representation of cloud albedo in mid-latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Run-up of debris flows against obstacles in their paths is a complex process that involves abrupt flow deceleration and redirection, and it thereby provides a stringent test of physically based debris-flow models. We have investigated run-up dynamics by using large-scale laboratory experiments, simple analytical models, and a depth-integrated numerical model (D-Claw). Our findings indicate that run-up behavior (and the relationship between run-up height, $H$, and incoming flow speed, $u_0$, and depth, $h_0$) varies significantly as the steepness of the obstacle varies, and also varies in response to wave interactions during the unsteady run-up process. Run-up against vertical walls that are normal to the incoming flow path is dominated by development of a shock, or jump in flow height, associated with an abrupt deceleration of the flow speed from $u_0$ to 0. With some incoming flow conditions, $H$ can greatly exceed $u_0^2/2g$, the value predicted by a point-mass run-up model (where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration). As the angle of inclination of the run-up obstacle decreases, the character of the run-up process changes to one dominated by a sustained, smooth flux of mass and momentum from the flow body into the flow head. Reduced energy dissipation in the absence of a shock can result in higher run-up. An obstacle inclination angle of about 20 to 30 degrees generally allows the highest run-up, although the optimal slope angle depends on a variety of factors such as debris liquefaction and a resultant reduction in friction. Our comparisons of model predictions and experimental data lead us to conclude that analytical models of shocks and momentum fluxes provide guidance for conceptualizing the run-up process, but fail to account for some of the dynamics involved. In contrast, D-Claw predictions of run-up are accurate and illustrate the dependence of run-up height on nuances in flow dynamics and obstacle geometry.",

The ropes are kink unstable ( I > 250 A) but not violently so. All three components of the magnetic field were measured with small (1 mm dia) 3-axis probes sensitive to and the plasma potential measured with an emissive probe. These were measured at over 42,000 locations in the volume containing the ropes and 7000 time steps (δτ = .33 μs). The total electric field and parallel resistivity as well as the Quasi Seperatrix layer (QSL) were derived from the data. The flux ropes periodically collide as they rotate about when another and kink. Each time this happens a strong QSL (Q<400) forms and the resistivity jumps to over a hundred times the classical value at locations within the QSL and also on the gradient of the rope current. The QSL formation and 3D electric fields are presented as a function of space and time. The reconnection rate is directly evaluated by integrating the electric field along field lines as well as the energy deposition . The data indicate that there is more than one process causing the enhanced resistivity. The reconnection rate cannot be explained by conventional 2D theories.",

            "abstract": "The alignment of the orientation of the horizontal seismometer components with the geographical coordinate system is critical for a wide variety of seismic analyses, but the traditional deployment method of ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) precludes knowledge of this parameter. Current techniques for determining the orientation predominantly rely on body and surface wave data recorded from teleseismic events with sufficiently large magnitudes. Both wave types experience lateral refraction between the source and receiver as a result of heterogeneity and anisotropy, and therefore the arrival angle of any one phase can significantly deviate from the great circle minor arc. We systematically compare the results and uncertainties obtained through current determination methods, as well as describe a new algorithm that uses body wave, surface wave, and differential pressure gauge data (where available) to invert for horizontal orientation. To start with, our method is based on the easily transportable computer code of Stachnik et al. (2012) that is publicly available through IRIS. A major addition is that we utilize updated global dispersion maps to account for lateral refraction, as was done by Laske (1995). We also make measurements in a wide range of frequencies, and analyze surface wave trains of repeat orbits. Our method has the advantage of requiring fewer total events to achieve high precision estimates, which is beneficial for OBS deployments that can be as short as weeks. Although the program is designed for the purpose of use with OBS instruments, it also works with standard land installations. We intend to provide the community with a program that is easy to use, requires minimal user input, and is optimized to work with data cataloged at the IRIS DMC.",

            "abstract": "The Terrebonne Basin is a salt bounded mini-basin in the northeast section of the Walker Ridge protraction area in the Gulf of Mexico (water depth ~2 km), where the Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project Leg 2 identified gas hydrate via logging-while-drilling in 2009. The Terrebonne Basin is infilled by gently dipping mud-rich sedimentary sequences with several sand units. Gas hydrate was detected in two significant reservoir sands 10s of meters in thickness, a number of thin 1 to 3 meter-thick sands, and in thick, 10-100 meter intervals of marine muds with gas hydrate in near-vertical fractures.\nIn this research, we combine 3D seismic mapping with wavelet and travel time analysis to interpret gas migration mechanisms in each hydrate-bearing sand. Our analyses suggest that the Orange sand, a main reservoir unit, is sourced from below the gas hydrate stability zone and, the 2.5 meter-thick Red sand (also called ‘Unit A’), is sourced locally. Our primary evidence is from seismic amplitudes across the two sands that show distinctly different patterns. The Orange sand has distinct high amplitudes within the gas hydrate stability zone and negative amplitudes suggesting free gas below the gas hydrate stability zone. The Red sand, in contrast, has no free gas source below the stability zone and the hydrate distribution as described by high amplitudes suggests that hydrate distribution is spotty. This may imply that gas generation is occurring sporadically in the surrounding marine mud units; this matches with a model of the Red sand that suggests it is sourced locally. These preliminary observations require further refinement but they indicate that fundamentally different migration mechanisms are occurring within a single hydrate system.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental question concerning magnetic energy release on the Sun is why the release occurs only after substantial stresses have been built up in the field. If reconnection were to occur readily, the released energy would be insufficient to explain coronal heating, CMEs, flares, jets, spicules, etc. How can we explain this switch-on property? What is the physical nature of the onset conditions? One idea involves the \"secondary instability\" of current sheets, which switches on when the rotation of the magnetic field across a current sheet reaches a critical angle. Such conditions would occur at the boundaries of flux tubes that become tangled and twisted by turbulent photospheric convection, for example. Other ideas involve a critical thickness for the current sheet. We report here on the preliminary results of our investigation of reconnect onset. Unlike our earlier work on the secondary instability (Dahlburg, Klimchuk, and Antiochos 2005), we treat the coupled chromosphere-corona system. Using the BATS-R-US MHD code, we simulate a single current sheet in a sheared magnetic field that extends from the chromosphere into the corona. Driver motions are applied at the base of the model. The configuration and chromosphere are both idealized, but capture the essential physics of the problem. The advantage of this unique approach is that it resolves the current sheet to the greatest extent possible while maintaining a realistic solar atmosphere. It thus bridges the gap between\"reconnection in a box\" studies and studies of large-scale systems such as active regions. One question we will address is whether onset conditions are met first in the chromosphere or corona. We will report on the work done on the project.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric water vapor is a fundamental ingredient both for regulating climate as a greenhouse gas and as a necessary precursor for high impact weather events such as heavy precipitation. Water vapor concentration varies geographically because of its close linkage with surface temperature and as a component of synoptic and mesoscale weather systems. Satellite observations provide the only means to quantify the global occurrence and variability of water vapor. In common with other long-term climate data records such as clouds and precipitation, intercalibrating and blending diverse measurements of water vapor to create a consistent record through time is a challenge.\nThe NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program supported the development of the NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP-M) dataset. The dataset was released to the science community in 2013 via the NASA Langley Atmospheric Science Data Center. The dataset is a global (land and ocean) water vapor dataset created by merging multiple satellite infrared and microwave sources of atmospheric water vapor along with surface data to form global gridded fields of total and layered precipitable water vapor. NVAP-M spans 22 years (1988-2009) of data.\nThe challenges in creating this multisensor, multidecadal satellite-driven climate data record are illustrative of challenges for all satellite climate data records. While advances in sensor intercalibration and retrieval algorithms have improved the quality of the global water vapor climate data record, uncertainties arise due to sampling biases of the input sensors. These biases are particularly evident on a regional scale, in cloudy regions or over desert surfaces. The changing mixture of sensors with varying sensitivity to clear/cloudy, land/ocean and even day/night conditions can lead to different results on trends and variability of water vapor. We explore this variability via the NVAP-M data set. Connections and collaborations with the international Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) Water Vapor Assessment (G-VAP) effort will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The fundamental pathways for tropical cyclone (TC) intensification are explored by considering axisymmetric and asymmetric impulsive thermal perturbations to balanced, TC-like vortices using the dynamic cores of three different numerical models. Attempts at reproducing the results of previous work, which used the community atmospheric model WRF (Nolan and Grasso 2003; NG03), revealed a discrepancy with the impacts of purely asymmetric thermal forcing. The current study finds that thermal asymmetries can have an important, largely positive role on the vortex intensification whereas NG03 and other studies find that asymmetric impacts are negligible.\nAnalysis of the spectral energetics of each numerical model indicates that the vortex response to asymmetric thermal perturbations is significantly damped in WRF relative to the other numerical models. Spectral kinetic energy budgets show that this anomalous damping is due to the increased removal of kinetic energy from the convergence of the vertical pressure flux, which is related to the flux of inertia-gravity wave energy. The increased kinetic energy in the other two models is shown to originate around the scales of the heating and propagate upscale with time. For very large thermal amplitudes (~ 50 K and above), the anomalous removal of kinetic energy due to inertia-gravity wave activity is much smaller resulting in little differences between models.\nThe results of this paper indicate that the numerical treatment of small-scale processes that project strongly onto inertia-gravity wave energy are responsible for these differences, with potentially important impacts for the understanding and prediction of TC intensification.",

The fluid mechanics of this process is explained the dynamics of the Horseshoe Vortex (HV) system that forms as a result of the flow separation induced by the object. In this work, the characteristics of the HV system in front of a wall-mounted circular cylinder have been studied experimentally to improve understanding of these complex dynamics as a function of relevant dimensionless parameters. The flow velocity field within the plane of symmetry, upstream of the cylinder, was measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and vorticity fields were obtained from this. A range of natural flow conditions were obtained when Froude number (Fr) was varied from subcritical to supercritical conditions over the range 0.015 to 2.46, and the influence of other governing parameters such as the cylinder-based and depth-based Reynolds numbers was also investigated systematically. The results of a Quadrant analysis show the variation in turbulent stress contributions from positions underneath and upstream of the HV system. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was used to elucidate the size and nature of the observed flow structure. The results show that the flow depth (h) has the primary control on the location of the HV system, while the magnitude of the peak wall stresses is controlled by cylinder diameter, Fr, and flow depth. That the controls include a mixture of dimensionless and dimensional factors highlights some of the complexity of translating laboratory results into practical recommendations for the study of natural systems, or for effective modelling with eddy-resolving numeric.",

Annual ET values were summarized by land use/land cover classes. Validation with eddy covariance (EC) flux towers and water balance approaches showed good accuracy levels with R2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.95 and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 and relative bias ranging from 2 to 35%. The root mean square error ranged from 0.48 – 0.60 mm for daily (days of satellite overpass) ET to 7.75 – 13.04 mm for monthly ET. The magnitude of ET among different land use/land cover between 2010 and 2013 were relatively consistent, showing cropped areas with the highest annual ET next to water bodies; this indicates the reliability of Landsat 8 for providing important information on ET dynamics across the landscape. Annual crop water use was estimated for selected five irrigation districts in the lower CRB where annual ET per district ranged between 681 – 772 mm. A rainfall analysis over these districts suggested that, on average, 69% of the annual ET was met by irrigation. Although the enhanced cloud-masking capability of Landsat 8 improved the removal of contaminated pixels, the ability to reliability estimate ET over these areas remains an important challenge. Although the relative performance of Landsat 8 was consistent for crop lands compared to the 2010 estimation, the large difference in the number of scenes between the two years precluded a meaningful comparison in absolute terms. Overall, the performance of Landsat 8 against available EC datasets and water balance estimates on a complex basin such as the CRB demonstrate the potential of using Landsat 8 for annual water use estimation at national scale.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's deep interior contains significant reservoirs of volatiles such as H, C, and N. Due to the incompatible nature of these volatile species, it has been difficult to reconcile their storage in the residual mantle immediately following crystallization of the terrestrial magma ocean. As the magma ocean freezes, it is commonly assumed, very small amounts of melt is retained in the residual mantle, limiting the trapped volatile concentration in the primordial mantle. In this presentation, we show that inefficient melt drainage out of the freezing front can retain large amounts of volatiles in the residual mantle while creating a thick early atmosphere. Using a two-phase flow model, we demonstrate that compaction within the moving freezing front is inefficient over time scales characteristic of magma ocean solidification. We employ a scaling relation between the trapped melt fraction, the rate of compaction, and the rate of freezing in our magma ocean evolution model. For cosmochemically plausible fractions of volatiles delivered during the later stages of accretion, our calculations suggest that up to 76% of total H2O and 11% of CO2 could have been trapped in the mantle during magma ocean crystallization. The assumption of a constant trapped melt fraction underestimates the mass of volatiles in the residual mantle by up to a factor of 15. Further, owing to particularly rapid magma ocean crystallization rates, the deepest mantle and the transition zone likely accumulate excess volatiles.",

            "abstract": "Subspace detection is a powerful tool for the identification of small seismic events. Subspace detectors improve upon single-event matched filtering techniques by using multiple orthogonal waveform templates whose linear combinations characterize a range of observed signals from previously identified earthquakes. Subspace detectors running on multiple stations can significantly increasing the number of locatable events, lowering the catalog’s magnitude of completeness and thus providing extraordinary detail on the kinematics of the aftershock process.\nThe 6 November 2011 M5.6 earthquake near Prague, Oklahoma is the largest earthquake instrumentally recorded in Oklahoma history and the largest earthquake resultant from deep wastewater injection. A M4.8 foreshock on 5 November 2011 and the M5.6 mainshock triggered tens of thousands of detectable aftershocks along a 20 km splay of the Wilzetta Fault Zone known as the Meeker-Prague fault. In response to this unprecedented earthquake, 21 temporary seismic stations were deployed surrounding the seismic activity.\nWe utilized a catalog of 767 previously located aftershocks to construct subspace detectors for the 21 temporary and 10 closest permanent seismic stations. Subspace detection identified more than 500,000 new arrival-time observations, which associated into more than 20,000 locatable earthquakes. The associated earthquakes were relocated using the Bayesloc multiple-event locator, resulting in ~7,000 earthquakes with hypocentral uncertainties of less than 500 m. The relocated seismicity provides unique insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the aftershock sequence along the Wilzetta Fault Zone and its associated structures. We find that the crystalline basement and overlying sedimentary Arbuckle formation accommodate the majority of aftershocks. While we observe aftershocks along the entire 20 km length of the Meeker-Prague fault, the vast majority of earthquakes were confined to a 9 km wide by 9 km deep surface striking N54°E and dipping 83° to the northwest near the junction of the splay with the main Wilzetta fault structure. Relocated seismicity shows off-fault stress-related interaction to distances of 10 km or more from the mainshock, including clustered seismicity to the northwest and southeast of the mainshock.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic deposits on the Moon are associated with a variety of settings, including domes, fractured crater floors, and rilles. Many of the largest pyroclastics, such as Aristarchus and Sulpicius Gallus are associated with rille volcanism, and mapping changes in the near-subsurface structure of these deposits can provide insight into the formation of these large deposits. This type of mapping can also highlight possible source regions. A comparison of multiple radar wavelengths (Arecibo/Green Bank 12.6 cm and 70 cm wavelength radar, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mini-RF 12.6 cm wavelength radar) with other LRO datasets (LRO Diviner and LRO Camera) has revealed changes in deposit thickness and structure around lunar rilles, including those associated with the large lunar pyroclastic deposits. For example, areas of thicker, rock-poor pyroclastics are identified that may indicate longer duration eruptions from parts of the rille. In most cases, the thickest, most block-free parts of the deposit occur near the ends of rilles. For some rilles, pyroclastics identified with radar are not visible in Diviner thermal infrared products, suggesting that there is a regolith-like surface that prevents the thermal wave from detecting deeper fine-grained materials. This upper surface could be produced by a shallow burial of the pyroclastics by regolith, or perhaps by a shift in volcanic style. Rille pyroclastics display a wide variety of correlation behaviors between the different wavelengths of data, suggesting that they have very different near-surface vertical structures. In this presentation we will focus on near-side rilles and pyroclastics in the Mare Serenitatis, Mare Vaporum, and Sinus Aestuum regions.",

They are more homogeneous than low Ti/Y basalts in SE Paraná and the Etendeka, with a restricted range in Sr-Nd-Pb isotope composition (87Sr/86Sr 0.7055-0.7063; εNd –5 to –3; 206Pb/204Pb 17.7-18.2). Subtle differences between Pitanga and Paranapanema (Th/Ta, 206Pb/204Pb) are consistent with minor crustal assimilation. Pitanga show greater incompatible element enrichment compared to Paranapanema (Ti/Y 440-590 vs. 325-510; La/Yb 9.3-12.2 vs. 5.9-9.0), and have greater MREE/HREE enrichment (Dy/Yb 2.1-2.5 vs. 1.8-2.1). Boreholes and surface profiles reveal a consistent temporal transition from Pitanga to Paranapanema lavas, and the decrease in Dy/Yb requires a shallowing of the mean depth of melting, consistent with lithospheric thinning. Pitanga and Paranapanema lavas show Dupal characteristics (elevated Δ7/4Pb 8-13), distinct from Tristan hot-spot and S Atlantic MORB compositions, but similar to the EM-I endmember composition from Walvis Ridge DSDP Site 525A. Previous workers suggested a common origin for Parana high Ti/Y magmas and DSDP Site 525A in continental lithospheric mantle. However, recent comprehensive sampling of the Tristan - Gough - Walvis Ridge - Rio Grande Rise hotspot track has revealed spatial geochemical zonation with a northern \"Tristan\"-track and a southern \"Gough\"-track, and the \"Tristan\" component (Δ7/4Pb 3-6) is only found in samples < 70 Ma (Hoernle et al. 2015). The early hotspot track history is dominated by the \"Gough\" component (Δ7/4Pb 6-13), inferred to be derived from the African LLSVP, and this material has the compositional features (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes, elevated La/Nb and Th/Nb) required for the mantle source for the Pitanga and Paranapanema magma types of the 135 Ma Paraná flood basalt province.",

Typically, yield is estimated from measured signal features, such as peak pressure, impulse, duration and/or arrival time of acoustic signals. However, the application of full waveform inversion to acoustic signals for yield estimation has not been fully explored. In this study, we apply a full waveform inversion method to local overpressure data to extract accurate pressure-time histories of acoustics sources during chemical explosions. A robust and accurate inversion technique for acoustic source is investigated using numerical Green's functions that take into account atmospheric and topographic propagation effects. The inverted pressure-time history represents the pressure fluctuation at the source region associated with the explosion, and thus, provides a valuable information about acoustic source mechanisms and characteristics in greater detail. We compare acoustic source properties (i.e., peak overpressure, duration, and non-isotropic shape) of a series of explosions having different emplacement conditions and investigate the relationship of the acoustic sources to the yields of explosions. The time histories of acoustic sources may refine our knowledge of sound-generation mechanisms of shallow explosions, and thereby allow for accurate yield estimation based on acoustic measurements.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor sediments approach active subduction zones with small amounts (generally < 1 dry weight %) of organic carbon, but this small concentration nonetheless constitutes a significant flux over geological time with respect to the size, isotopic composition and electron balance of the carbosphere. In order to quantify the flux of organic carbon into subduction zones, we have examined carbon concentration and density measurements provided by successive drilling programs (DSDP, ODP, IODP) for cores that sample complete sediment sections to basement near deep sea trenches. An interpolation scheme compensates for sparse or non-uniform analyses, and a weighted bulk concentration is calculated for organic carbon (OC) and inorganic carbonate (IC) for each site. When multiplied by the sediment thickness, the trench length and the convergence velocity, a subducted mass flux can be obtained. Sites with the greatest concentration of OC include those that pass beneath regions of high biological productivity (such as the Eastern Equatorial Pacific) and those that receive terrigenous turbidites (e.g., Indus and Begal Fans, Gulf of Alaska, Cascadia, etc). Together, terrigenous turbidites make up about 60% of the global subducted sediment (GLOSS), and thus have a strong control on the concentration of OC in GLOSS. Sites dominated by terrigenous turbidites have 0.4 wt% OC on average (1sd = 0.1 wt%), and GLOSS is very similar, yielding about 6 MtC/yr OC subducted globally. This flux is enough to subduct the entire surface pool of OC every 2.6 Ga, which if not returned, or returned in a more oxidized form, could contribute to a significant rise in oxygen at the surface of the Earth. Seemingly fortuitously, the OC/total carbon fraction in GLOSS is 20%, very near the long term average required to maintain the isotopic composition of marine carbonates at ~ 0 per mil d13C over much of Earth history.",

            "abstract": "Seismological information on crustal structure, when combined with other geophysical, petrological and geochemical constraints, provides our best insight into the structure and composition of Earth’s continental crust. Traditionally, published models of the continental crust (e.g. Vp profiles) constrained by seismic reflection, refraction experiments and (or) receiver functions are used to infer the thickness and lithology of the upper, middle, and lower crust. In order to be most useful, however, inferences of crustal structure and composition made using seismological models as data need to be presented alongside their uncertainties. Quantifying this uncertainty is the challenge.\nIn this work, we use the transdimensional hierarchical Bayesian inverse (THBI) approach to construct phase velocity maps for surface waves (5s - 40s), while quantifying uncertainties in the phase velocities (model variance and co-variance), as well as data noise (which can affect the model results), all without having to make a-priori choices of model parameterization or regularization.\nWe show that phase velocity maps constructed with THBI are comparable to those from linear, least-squares inversion at long wavelengths, though differences are present across length-scales. Average phase dispersion curves extracted from our maps are statistically significantly different from predictions from a selection of global and regional crustal models (e.g., CRUST1.0 and NACR14), particularly in the western USA and across major sedimentary basins. These model-data inconsistencies suggest that tectonic regionalization and averaging can introduce significant errors into the crustal models.\nWe also preview a second stage analysis where we use the phase-dispersion curves (and their uncertainties) as data to constrain 1-D velocity profiles (with radial anisotropy) across distinct geological provinces in the continental US. We demonstrate, again using the THBI approach, the consequences of more accurate treatment of uncertainty on inferences on the 1-D velocity models.",

            "abstract": "The characterization of grain boundaries and shapes along with crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs) are a key aspect of investigations of rock microstructures for their correlation with deformation mechanisms. Rapid developments have occurred in the studying rock microstructures due to recent improvements in analytical techniques such as Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). EBSD technique allows quick automated microtextural characteritzation.\nThe deformed banded iron formations (BIFs) occurring in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero (QF) province in Brazil have been studied extensively with EBSD. All studies have focused mainly in CPOs. The general agreement is that dislocation creep was the dominant process of deformation, for the strong c-axis fabric of hematite crystals. This idea is substantiated by viscoplastic self-consistent models for deformation of hematite. However there are limitations to analyzing natural CPOs alone, or those generated by deformation models. The strong c-axis fabric could be taken as equally powerful an evidence for other known deformation mechanisms.\nSome grain boundary types in BIFs of the QF are irregular and comprise equant grains in granoblastic texture (Figure 1a). CPOs for this kind are strong and consistent with a predominance of dislocation creep. Others are very regular and long parallel to basal planes of hematites forming large elongated crystals (lepidoblastic texture, Figure 1b). Such crystals are called specularite, and their formation has been previously attributed to dislocation creep. This is erroneous because of the high strains which would be required. Their shape must be due to anisotropic grain growth. Other types lie between the above end-textures.\nBoth types of grain shape microstructures have the same core deformation mechanism. Describing their genetic differences is crucial, since specularite owe its shape to anisotropic grain growth. It is not possible yet to confirm that dislocation creep was the dominant deformation mechanism. BIFs with granoblastic texture and strong CPOs do support dislocation creep, as do the specularite-bearing rocks. We reinterpret specularites as originating in post-tectonic grain growth, after major dislocation creep produced strong crystallographic fabrics.",

A global Earth System Data Record of daily landscape freeze-thaw status (FT-ESDR) derived from satellite microwave remote sensing was used to define the FR season [days] from the number of classified FR or transitional (AM frozen, PM non-frozen) days. SCE duration [%] was estimated from NOAA/NCDC CDR northern hemisphere weekly SCE data records. We find that relatively strong declines in FR and SCE durations in spring and summer are partially offset by increasing trends in fall and winter. These contrasting seasonal trends result in relatively weak decreasing trends in annual FR and SCE durations. A dominant SCE retreat response to FR season decreases coincides with widespread warming (0.44°C decade-1), while the sign and strength of this relationship is spatially complex, varying by latitude, regional snow cover and climate characteristics. The spatial extent of FR conditions exceeds SCE in early spring and is smaller during snowmelt in late spring and early summer, while FR ground in the absence of snow cover is widespread in the fall. To gain new insight on the spatial and temporal characteristics of seasonal FR ground and snowmelt changes, we conducted an integrated analysis of the independent FT-ESDR and SCE data records. Snowmelt was defined for grid cells where the SCE record indicated snow cover presence, but the FT-ESDR indicated transitional FT conditions. Frozen ground cells were defined for coincident FR and snow-free SCE conditions. The integrated satellite record reveals a general increasing trend in annual snowmelt duration from 1.3 to 3.3 days decade-1 (p<0.01), occurring largely in the fall. The annual duration of frozen ground conditions in the absence of insulating snow cover is declining from 0.8 to 1.3 days decade-1. These changes imply extensive biophysical impacts to northern snow cover, soil and permafrost regimes, with potentially large climate feedbacks, while ongoing satellite microwave missions provide an effective means for regional monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Pennatulaceans are sessile, benthic marine organisms that are bathymetrically wide-ranging, from the intertidal to approximately 6300 m in depth, and are conspicuous constituents of deep-sea environments. The vast majority of species are adapted for anchoring in soft sediments by the cylindrical peduncle – a muscular hydrostatic skeleton. However, in the past decade a few species (“Rockpens”) have been discovered and described that can attach to hard substratum such as exposed rocky outcrops at depths between 669 and 1969 m, by a plunger-like adaptation of the base of the peduncle. Of the thirty-six known genera, eleven (or 30%) have been recorded from depths greater than 1000 m. The pennatulacean depth record holders are an unidentified species of Umbellula from 6260 m in the Peru-Chile Trench and a recently-discovered and described genus and species, Porcupinella profunda, from 5300 m the Porcupine Abyssal Plain of the northeastern Atlantic.\nA morphologically-differentiated type of polyp (acrozooid) have recently been discovered and described in two genera of shallow-water coral reef sea pens. Acrozooids apparently represent asexual buds and presumably can detach from the adult to start clonal colonies through asexual budding. Acrozooids are to be expected in deep-sea pennatulaceans, but so far have not been observed below 24 m in depth.\nMorphological responses at depths greater than 1000 m in deep-sea pennatulaceas include: fewer polyps, larger polyps, elongated stalks, and clustering of polyps along the rachis.\nResponses to deep-ocean physical parameters and anthropogenic changes that could affect the abundance and distribution of deep-sea pennatulaceans include changes in bottom current flow and food availability, changes in seawater temperature and pH, habitat destruction by fish trawling, and sunken refuse pollution. No evidence of the effects of ocean acidification or other effects of anthropogenic climate change in sea pens of the deep-sea has been recorded as yet. However, the effects of plastic pollution and trawling damage in the deep-sea regarding pennatulacean populations are known in various regions globally.",

            "abstract": "The research, policy, and NGO communities have devoted significant attention to the potential for agricultural intensification, or closure of “yield gaps,” to alleviate future global hunger, poverty, climate change impacts, and other threats. However, because the research to this point has focused on biophysically attainable yields—assuming optimal choices under ideal conditions—the presently available work has not yet addressed the likely responses of the agricultural sector to real-world conditions in the future. This study investigates endogenous agricultural intensification in response to global climate change impacts—that is, intensification independent of policies or other exogenous interventions to promote yield gap closure. The framework for the analysis is a set of scenarios to 2100 in the GCAM global integrated assessment model, enhanced to include endogenous irrigation, fertilizer application, and yields, in each of 283 land use regions, with maximum yields based on the 95th percentile of attainable yields in a recent global assessment. We assess three levels of agricultural climate impacts, using recent global gridded crop model datasets: none, low (LPJmL), and high (Pegasus). Applying formulations for decomposition of climate change impacts response developed in prior AgMIP work, we find that at the global level, availability of high-yielding technologies mitigates price shocks and shifts the agricultural sector’s climate response modestly towards intensification, away from cropland expansion and reduced production. At the regional level, the behavior is more complex; nevertheless, availability of high-yielding production technologies enhances the inter-regional shifts in agricultural production that are induced by climate change, complemented by commensurate changes in trade patterns. The results highlight the importance of policies to facilitate yield gap closure and inter-regional trade as mechanisms for adapting to climate change",

            "abstract": "Degradation of permafrost in high latitude ecosystems causes changes in surface moisture, vegetation and consequently carbon cycling. Many studies have reported that methane emissions from these ecosystems are increasing with permafrost thaw. Lakes and ponds in these landscapes are also large sources of methane with increased emissions correlated to rising temperatures and longer ice-free seasons. The temporal and spatial scale of disturbance from permafrost degradation varies depending on the transfer of heat and the hydrological connectivity of an ecosystem. The Stordalen Mire, located in sub-Arctic Sweden, is located along the discontinuous permafrost zone has been the focus of research to understand carbon cycling for many years. Previous work at this site has identified changes in vegetation and emissions of methane over decadal time scales. Our research has focused on short term changes in this ecosystem. Using a combination of field based measurements of methane emissions from a permafrost thaw gradient across the peatland that includes both thaw ponds and lakes and studies of vegetation species composition and percent cover and near and far remote sensing platforms to identify land surface characteristics, we were able to identify changes in the landscape surface and in methane emissions from peat and water surfaces at the Stordalen Mire over the period from 2012-2015.",

            "abstract": "Miocene Lake Clarkia formed when lava flows of the Priest Rapids Member of the Columbia River Basalt dammed the ancestral St. Maries River, in northern Idaho. The lake deposits are well known for their exceptional preservation of leaf fossils. Chemically correlating lacustrine tephra layers to volcanic centers, of known compositions and ages, can be used to help better constrain the timing and rate of deposition in the lake. Early work attempted to constrain Clarkia Lake’s depositional age from index fossil flora correlations. More recently, electron microprobe analyses of Clarkia Lake’s ash deposits demonstrate that several ash layers may correlate with Nevada’s Yellowstone hot spot Cold Springs Tuff of the Santa-Rosa Calico volcanic field (15.5-15.9 Ma; Ladderud et al., in press). In the present study, further microprobe analysis has uncovered additional ash layers with the same range of chemical compositions. The apparent identical compositions of multiple tephra layers at different stratigraphic positions may be attributed to the eruption of multiple, chemically similar magmas, perhaps mapped as a single unit in the source area, or to post-emplacement re-working of these layers by sedimentary processes. The latter is considered less likely because many of the ashes contain little detrital material. Despite the ambiguity, these chemically identical tephra layers have the potential to provide information about the unique tephra composition and eruptive frequency in the source area, and/or unusual hydrological reworking processes associated with the mid-Miocene lacustrine environment.\n",

To accomplish this, we have developed a Biot-Savart integrator, which calculates the spatial magnetic field from its source electric current. We validate the LFM Biot-Savart module using simple geospace current distributions with known analytic solutions.

            "abstract": "We observe a new type of non-wetting phase flow using time-resolved pore scale imaging. The traditional conceptual model of drainage involves a non-wetting phase invading a porous medium saturated with a wetting phase as either a fixed, connected flow path through the centres of pores or as discrete ganglia which move individually through the pore space, depending on the capillary number. We observe a new type of flow behaviour at low capillary number in which the flow of the non-wetting phase occurs through networks of persistent ganglia that occupy the large pores but continuously rearrange their connectivity (Figure 1). Disconnections and reconnections occur randomly to provide short-lived pseudo-steady state flow paths between pores. This process is distinctly different to the notion of flowing ganglia which coalesce and break-up. The size distribution of ganglia is dependent on capillary number.\nExperiments were performed by co-injecting N2and 25 wt% KI brine into a Bentheimer sandstone core (4mm diameter, 35mm length) at 50°C and 10 MPa. Drainage was performed at three flow rates (0.04, 0.3 and 1 ml/min) at a constant fractional flow of 0.5 and the variation in ganglia populations and connectivity observed. We obtained images of the pore space during steady state flow with a time resolution of 43 s over 1-2 hours. Experiments were performed at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron.\nFigure 1. The position of N2 in the pore space during steady state flow is summed over 40 time steps. White indicates that N2 occupies the space over >38 time steps and red <5 time steps.",

            "abstract": "Research by the science community into volcanic histories and physical processes at Cascade volcanoes in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California has been ongoing for over a century. Eruptions in the 20th century at Lassen Peak and Mount St. Helen demonstrated the active nature of Cascade volcanoes; the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was a defining moment in modern volcanology. The first modern volcano hazards assessments were produced by the USGS for some Cascade volcanoes in the 1960s. A rich scientific literature exists, much of which addresses hazards at these active volcanoes. That said community awareness, planning, and preparation for eruptions generally do not occur as a result of a hazard analyses published in scientific papers, but by direct communication with scientists. Relative to other natural hazards, volcanic eruptions (or large earthquakes, or tsunami) are outside common experience, and the public and many public officials are often surprised to learn of the impacts volcanic eruptions could have on their communities. In the 1980s, the USGS recognized that effective hazard communication and preparedness is a multi-faceted, long-term undertaking and began working with federal, state, and local stakeholders to build awareness and foster community action about volcano hazards. Activities included forming volcano-specific workgroups to develop coordination plans for volcano emergencies; a concerted public outreach campaign; curriculum development and teacher training; technical training for emergency managers and first responders; and development of hazard information that is accessible to non-specialists. Outcomes include broader ownership of volcano hazards as evidenced by bi-national exchanges of emergency managers, community planners, and first responders; development by stakeholders of websites focused on volcano hazards mitigation; and execution of table-top and functional exercises, including evacuation drills by local communities.",

They occupy ¼ of the land surface of the country, account for over 15 billion USD of annual revenue through the sale of beef, leather, and milk, are closely associated with deforestation, and have been projected to substantially grow in the coming decades. Sustainable intensification of production in the sector could help to limit environmental harm from increased production, but productivity growth could be inhibited by climate change. Gauging the potential future impacts of climate change on the Brazilian livestock sector can be aided by examining past evidence of the link between climate and cattle production and productivity. We use statistical techniques to investigate the contribution of climate variability and climate change to variability in cattle system output in Brazil’s municipalities over the period 1974 to 2013. We find significant impacts of both temperature and precipitation variability and temperature trends on municipality-level exports and the production of both milk and beef. Pasture productivity, represented by a vegetation index, also varies significantly with climate shocks. In some regions, losses from exposure to climate trends were of comparable magnitude to technology and/or market-driven productivity gains over the study period.",

            "abstract": "The implications of a changing climate system include more than a simple temperature increase. A changing climate also modifies atmospheric conditions responsible for shaping the genesis and evolution of atmospheric circulations. In the mid-latitudes, the effects of climate change on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) can be expressed through changes in bulk temperature, horizontal and vertical temperature gradients (leading to changes in mean state winds) as well as atmospheric moisture content. Understanding how these changes impact ETC evolution and dynamics will help to inform climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, and allow for better informed weather emergency planning. However, our understanding is complicated by the complex interplay between a variety of environmental influences, and their potentially opposing effects on extratropical cyclone strength. Attempting to untangle competing influences from a theoretical or observational standpoint is complicated by nonlinear responses to environmental perturbations and a lack of data. As such, numerical models can serve as a useful tool for examining this complex issue.\nWe present results from an analysis framework that combines the computational power of idealized modeling with the statistical robustness of multivariate sensitivity analysis. We first establish control variables, such as baroclinicity, bulk temperature, and moisture content, and specify a range of values that simulate possible changes in a future climate. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model serves as the link between changes in climate state and ETC relevant outcomes. A diverse set of output metrics (e.g., sea level pressure, average precipitation rates, eddy kinetic energy, and latent heat release) facilitates examination of storm dynamics, thermodynamic properties, and hydrologic cycles. Exploration of the multivariate sensitivity of ETCs to changes in control parameters space is performed via an ensemble of WRF runs coupled with a statistical response surface emulator and uncertainty quantification framework. The result is a quantitative estimate of the relationship between our selected control variables and their effects on ETC evolution.",

            "abstract": "Many precipitation data sets have been produced in the past two decades based on gauge measurements, satellite observations and their combinations. Their applications in hydroclimate, however, are compromised by a number of shortcomings in long-term homogeneity, quantitative accuracy, and time/space resolution. The objective of this work is to construct a homogenous analysis of daily precipitation on a 0.25olat/lon grid over the global land for a 37-year period from 1979 to the present through combining information from CDR for the satellite observed HIRS OLR, as well as daily and monthly gauge data.\nFirst, CPC unified daily gauge analysis is calibrated against the GPCC monthly gauge data set to correct under-estimates in the daily analysis caused by the negatively biased daily station reports. The resulting adjusted daily gauge analysis presents improved quantitative accuracy over regions with reasonable gauge coverage. A technique is then developed to derive precipitation estimates from the OLR data. PDF tables are created for the OLR and matched against those for the collocated CMORPH satellite precipitation estimates using data for 1998 to 2014. An observed HIRS OLR value is converted to precipitation through the matched OLR and precipitation PDF tables. The technique is applied to generate precipitation estimates on a 0.25olat/lon grid over the globe for the entire HIRS OLR data period from 1979. The adjusted daily gauge analysis and the HIRS OLR-based precipitation estimates are then blended through the OI technique. The OLR precipitation estimates are used as the first guess, while the gauge data are utilized as the observation to refine the first guess.\nA suite of comprehensive procedures are implemented to examine the quantitative accuracy and homogeneity of the 37-year daily precipitation data set. In particular, experiments are conducted to force the Noah land model with our new daily precipitation analysis operating under the NCEP Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Detailed results will be reported at the GEWEX conference.\nAt the AGU Meetings, we will also report our recent progress on desegregating the daily precipitation analysis into three-hourly time resolution using estimates derived from GRIDSAT Climate Data Record (CDR) for geostationary TBB.",

            "abstract": "During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), rapid surface ocean acidification is indicated by a large decrease in the B/Ca ratios of planktic foraminiferal calcite, which is a proxy for the surface ocean carbonate system [1]. However, due to uncertainty in the effects of past seawater chemistry (e.g, different [Mg], [Ca], and [B]) on B/Ca, modern calibrations cannot be used to estimate the magnitude of acidification during this critical period. In addition, recent inorganic and sediment trap studies have respectively documented the controls of growth rate and light levels on B/Ca [2,3]. To extend the application of the B/Ca proxy to the PETM, we have conducted culturing experiments in O. universa, G. ruber, and G. sacculifer in which we simulated changes in pH and total DIC under Paleogene seawater conditions- high [Ca], low [Mg], and low [B]. We have further investigated the effects of variable light intensity (a control on symbiont activity), [Ca]seawater, and [B]seawater on the proxy. Results from O. universa confirm that B/Ca decreases with increasing DIC, decreasing pH, and decreasing [B]seawater, supporting a [B(OH)4-]/DIC control on the proxy [4]. In contrast, neither low light nor [Ca]seawater have a measurable effect on B/Ca, implying that influences of these parameters over the PETM were likely negligible. Critically, B/Ca appears to be more sensitive to pH at very low [B(OH)4-]/DIC in comparison to modern calibrations. Using estimates of surface ocean pH from boron isotopes, new calibrations can explain a larger proportion of the observed B/Ca excursion over the PETM. However, simulation of a large DIC pulse is necessary to explain the full excursion. New data will be presented from species that are more sensitive to pH, such as G. ruber and G. sacculifer, which will illuminate the range of responses of B/Ca to ocean acidification during the Paleogene.\n[1] Penman et al. 2014.

            "abstract": "The quality of automatic detections from seismic sensor networks depends on a large number of data processing parameters that interact in complex ways. The largely manual process of identifying effective parameters is painstaking and does not guarantee that the resulting controls are the optimal configuration settings. Yet, achieving superior automatic detection of seismic events is closely related to these parameters. We present an automated sensor tuning (AST) system that learns near-optimal parameter settings for each event type using neuro-dynamic programming (reinforcement learning) trained with historic data. AST learns to test the raw signal against all event-settings and automatically self-tunes to an emerging event in real-time. The overall goal is to reduce the number of missed legitimate event detections and the number of false event detections. Reducing false alarms early in the seismic pipeline processing will have a significant impact on this goal. Applicable both for existing sensor performance boosting and new sensor deployment, this system provides an important new method to automatically tune complex remote sensing systems. Systems tuned in this way will achieve better performance than is currently possible by manual tuning, and with much less time and effort devoted to the tuning process. With ground truth on detections in seismic waveforms from a network of stations, we show that AST increases the probability of detection while decreasing false alarms.",

            "abstract": "The sea-ice freeboard and thickness are derived from the six sea-ice flights of NASA’s IceBridge Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) over the Arctic from 2009 to 2013. The LVIS is an airborne scanning laser altimeter. It can operate at an altitude up to 10 km above the ground and produce a data swath up to 2 km wide with 20-m wide footprints. The laser output wavelength is 1064 nm and pulse repetition rate is 1000 Hz. The LVIS L2 geolocated surface elevation product and Level-1b waveform product (http://nsidc.org/data/ilvis2.html and\nhttp://nsidc.org/data/ilvis1b.html\n) at National Snow and Ice Data Center, USA (NSIDC) are used in this study. The elevations are referenced to a geoid with tides and dynamic atmospheric corrections applied. The LVIS waveforms were fitted with Gaussian curves to calculate pulse width, peak location, pulse amplitude, and signal baseline. For each waveform, the centroid, skewness, kurtosis, and pulse area were also calculated. The waveform parameters were calibrated based on laser off pointing angle and laser channels. Calibrated LVIS waveform parameters show a coherent response to variations in surface features along their ground tracks. These parameters, combined with elevation, can be used to identify leads, enabling the derivation of sea-ice freeboard and thickness without relying upon visual images. Preliminary results show that the elevations in some of the LVIS campaigns may vary with laser incident angle; this can introduce an elevation bias if not corrected. Further analysis of the LVIS data shown that the laser incident angle related elevation bias can be removed empirically. The sea-ice freeboard and thickness results from LVIS are compared with NASA’s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) for an April 20, 2010 flight, when both LVIS and ATM sensors were on the same aircraft and made coincidental measurements along repeat ground tracks.",

            "abstract": "Dawn’s exploration of Vesta and Ceres has revealed their geophysical characteristics, informing the processes that shaped the bodies. Dawn has determined the average diameter of Ceres to be 940 km, smaller than the previously estimated 975 km [1]. This implies a density of 2160 kg/m3, indicating that Ceres is less differentiated than predicted [2]. Ceres’ entire surface is cratered, implying the lack of a thick (10’s of km) water ice layer at the surface. Variability in Ceres’ crater morphology indicates that the near-surface layer has variable strength and rheology, likely due to heterogeneity in the near-surface mixture of rock, ice and salt. These observations may indicate that Ceres lost a significant amount of an original surface ice layer due to impact erosion. The lack of large impact basins on Ceres can be interpreted to be the result of viscous relaxation. These data provide insights into Ceres’ thermal evolution and mechanical properties, which appear to be unique to this warm, icy body. In contrast to Ceres, Vesta formed very early and hot, resulting in a fully differentiated body. Dawn’s exploration revealed geophysical and geochemical evidence for an iron-rich core and basaltic crust. However, unlike the pre-Dawn paradigm of Vesta’s evolution, Dawn found that the crust and mantle of Vesta are less distinct than predicted by classical differentiation models.\n[1] Thomas, P.

The Bulletin 17B framework assumes that the annual peak flow data included in a flood frequency analysis are from a homogeneous population. However, flood frequency analysis over the western United States is complicated by annual peak flow records that frequently contain annual flows generated from distinctly different flood generating mechanisms. In particular, these flood series contain multiple zero flows and/or potentially influential low floods that substantially deviate from the overall pattern, as well as extreme flood events representing different hydrometeorologic events. Among the different flood generating mechanisms, atmospheric rivers are responsible for large, regional scale floods. This study examines the role played by atmospheric rivers in flood frequency analyses across the western United States. Results are based on U.S. Geological Survey streamflow-gaging stations with a record of at least 30 years, and highlight the areas of the western United States that are most affected by these events.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem dynamics are strongly influenced by processes of disturbance and recovery across a range of spatial and temporal scales, from large catastrophic events including tropical cyclones, fires, and pest outbreaks, to fine-scale forest canopy gap dynamics. Natural disturbances episodically alter vegetation structure and create important fluxes of carbon from vegetation to coarse woody debris and litter, and can alter land surface properties important for climate. Similarly, anthropogenic disturbances have the capacity to alter important land surface properties. Recovery following disturbances tends to restore vegetation structure and carbon over longer time scales as vegetation regrows and debris decomposes and land surface properties are restored. The complex spatial pattern from a legacy of past events, together with ongoing and potentially changing future events, presents a challenge not only for understanding, but also for prediction. As many disturbance processes are climate related, being climate driven and/or producing affects on climate through biophysical or biogeochemical alterations of the land surface, disturbance is a critical link in understanding plant-climate interactions. Here we review past progress, current results, and future priorities for utilizing remote sensing data in advanced models to understand of the role of disturbance in plant-climate interactions. Recent advances have helped to quantify the long term impacts of hurricanes on forests, account for recent forest disturbance events, quantify the vulnerability of ecosystems to potential future disturbance rates, and project future vegetation change in response to climate change, and reduce uncertainty through improved initial conditions accounting for the history of past disturbance events. Now, a new generation of land use data are being developed constrained by remote sensing to drive the next generation of Earth system models to estimate the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on climate (past-future). With parallel advances in remote sensing and modeling, we are entering a new era in the understanding plant-climate interactions.",

The ≤29.4-28.8 Ma Job Canyon caldera in the Stillwater Range is filled with ~4 km of intracaldera tuff and lava flows; the 28.4 Ma IXL pluton intrudes intracaldera tuff and extends to ≥9 km depth. The 29 Ma Deep Canyon caldera covers ~250 km2 of the Clan Alpine Mountains, but only the upper ~1 km is exposed. The ≤26.0-25.2 Ma Poco Canyon caldera in the Stillwater Range is filled with two distinct intracaldera tuffs totaling 4.5 km thick, underlain by the 24.8 Ma Freeman Creek pluton exposed to depths ≥8 km. The small 25.3 Ma Louderback Mountains caldera in the SW Clan Alpine Mountains is filled with ~600 m of intracaldera tuff deposited on Oligocene rhyolite lava flows. The 25.1 Ma Elevenmile Canyon caldera spans ~1600 km2 in the Stillwater Range, Clan Alpine Mountains, and Desatoya Mountains, where it overlaps or cross cuts older calderas. Its total volume is ≥2500 km3, mostly consisting of the 1-4 km thick tuff of Elevenmile Canyon. 24.9-25.5 Ma silicic intrusive rocks underlie the Louderback Mountains and Elevenmile Canyon calderas to depths ≥6-8 km, locally surrounding septa of basement rock and older Oligocene igneous rocks. Two magmatic pulses, each lasting ~1 m.y. and associated with the 29 and 25 Ma caldera complexes, replaced almost the entire Mesozoic upper crust with Oligocene intrusive and extrusive rock to depths ≥9 km over a 1500 km2 area (pre-extension). Magma emplacement was most likely accommodated by downward transfer of country rocks and accompanied by isostatic surface uplift. If other Great Basin calderas are similar, the dense concentration of shallowly exposed calderas in central Nevada may be underlain by a mid-Tertiary batholith assembled in discrete pulses that coincided with formation of large silicic calderas.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, a team of Dartmouth, CRREL, and University of Maine researchers conducted the first of three annual ground-penetrating radar surveys of the McMurdo Shear Zone using robot-towed instruments. This survey provides over 100 transects of a 5.7 km x 5.0 km grid spanning the width of the shear zone at spacing of approximately 50 m. Transect direction was orthogonal to ice flow. Additionally, a dense 200 m x 200 m grid was surveyed at 10 m spacing in both the N-S and W-E directions. Radar settings provided 20 traces/sec, which combined with an average robot speed of 1.52 m/s, provides a trace every 7.6 cm. The robot towed two antenna units at 400 MHz and 200 MHz center frequencies, with the former penetrating to approximately 19 m. We establish boundaries for the shear zone over the region surveyed using the 400 MHz antenna data, and we geo-locate crevasses using feature-based machine learning classification of GPR traces into one of three classes – 1) firn, 2) distinct crevasses, and 3) less distinct or deeper features originating within the 19 m penetration depth. Distinct crevasses feature wide, hyperbolic reflections with strike angles of 35–40° to transect direction and clear voids. Less distinct or deeper features range from broad diffraction patterns with no clear void to overlapping diffractions extending tens of meters in width with or without a clear void. The classification is derived from statistical features of unprocessed traces and thus provides a computationally efficient means for eventual real-time classification of GPR traces. Feature-based classification is shown to be insensitive to artifacts related to rolling or pitching motion of the instrument sled and also provides a means of assessing crevasse width and depth. In subsequent years, we will use feature-based classification to estimate ice flow and evolution of individual crevasses.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how the magnetically-closed corona is heated remains one of the most important goals in Heliophysics. It is generally believed that much or most of the heating involves the conversion of energy that is stored in stressed magnetic fields. What makes the problem so challenging is that the conversion process involves very small spatial scales. Simulations of, e.g., solar active regions cannot resolve the thin current sheets that separate the approximately 100,000 elemental magnetic flux strands that comprise a real active region. Heating in the simulations primarily takes the form of Ohmic dissipation of currents that are far less structured. Thus, the heating is only a proxy for the real heating mechanism. How good a proxy is it? Does it have the essential properties of the real mechanism? We suggest that the details of coronal heating matter. They determine not only the temporal behavior and spatial distribution of the heating, but also the total amount of energy release. We present some idealized MHD simulations that demonstrate this last point.",

            "abstract": "The ultra-wideband software-defined microwave radiometer (UWBRAD) is designed to provide ice sheet internal temperature product via measuring low frequency microwave emission. Twelve channels ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 GHz are covered by the instrument. A Bayesian framework was designed to retrieve the ice sheet internal temperature from UWBRAD brightness temperature (Tb) measurements for the Greenland air-borne demonstration scheduled for summer 2016. Several parameters would affect the ice sheet physical temperature. And the effective surface temperature, geothermal heat flux and the variance of upper layer ice density were treated as unknown random variables within the retrieval framework. Synthetic brightness temperature were calculated by the snow radiation transfer models as a function of ice temperature, ice density, and an estimate of snow grain size in the upper layers. A incoherent model-the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) and a coherent model were used respectively to estimate the influence of coherent effect. The inputs of the radiation transfer model were generated from a 1-D heat-flow equation developed by Robin and a exponential fit of ice density variation from Borehole measurement. The simulated Tb was corrupted with white noise and served as UWBRAD observation in retrieval. A look-up table was developed between the parameters and the corresponding Tb. In the Bayesian retrieval process, each parameter was defined with its possible range and set to be uniformly distributed. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was applied to make the unknown parameters randomly walk in the parameter space. Experiment results were examined for science goals on three levels: estimation of the 10-m firn temperature, the average temperature integrated with depth, and the entire temperature profile. The 10-m temperature was estimated to within 0.77 K, with a bias of 0.6 K, across the 47 locations on the ice sheet; the 10-m “synthetic true” temperatures ranged from 246 – 262 K. The vertically-averaged temperature RMSE was 1.0 K, with a bias of 0.5 K. In future experiments, other parameters, such as the correlation length of snow grains, will be included.",

            "abstract": "NOAA’s next-generation environmental satellite, the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) replaces the current Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). JPSS satellites carry sensors which collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological, and solar-geophysical observations of the earth, atmosphere, and space. The first JPSS satellite was launched in 2011 and is currently NOAA’s primary operational polar satellite. The JPSS ground system is the Common Ground System (CGS), and provides command, control, and communications (C3) and data processing (DP). A multi-mission system, CGS provides combinations of C3/DP for numerous NASA, NOAA, DoD, and international missions. In preparation for the next JPSS satellite, CGS improved its multi-mission capabilities to enhance mission operations for larger constellations of earth observing satellites with the added benefit of streamlining mission operations for other NOAA missions.\nThis paper will discuss both the theoretical basis and the actual practices used to date to identify, test and incorporate algorithm updates into the CGS processing baseline. To provide a basis for this support, Raytheon developed a theoretical analysis framework, and the application of derived engineering processes, for the maintenance of consistency and integrity of remote sensing operational algorithm outputs. The framework is an abstraction of the operationalization of the science-grade algorithm (Sci2Ops) process used throughout the JPSS program. By combining software and systems engineering controls, manufacturing disciplines to detect and reduce defects, and a standard process to control analysis, an environment to maintain operational algorithm maturity is achieved. Results of the use of this approach to implement algorithm changes into operations will also be detailed.",

            "abstract": "Water of crystallization in gypsum can be used as paleo-environmental proxy to study large scale climatic variability in arid areas. This is because changes in the isotopic composition of water of crystallization are due to isotopic variations in the mother brine from which the mineral precipitated, and the brine isotopic composition is linked to evaporation processes and humidity. This is particularly important when the salts are the only traces left of the original water, i.e. in modern arid areas. This study aims to prove that the 2-D/18-O compositions of the water of crystallization extracted from successive precipitates or even different growth zones of natural gypsum (CaSO4·H2O) can reconstruct the evaporation history and paleo-humidity of the source water basin. The method was tested in a laboratory experiment that evaporated CaSO4 brines under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. The brine was left to evaporate for five days at two different humidities (45 and 75 RH%); subsequently, brines and precipitated gypsum were sampled at 24 hour intervals. In this way we simulated zoned growth of gypsum. The samples were then analyzed for oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition using a Thermo Scientific TC/EA with modified column, coupled to a MAT 253 Thermo Finnigan mass spectrometer at JPL. If preliminary results validate the novel hypothesis that changes in mineral composition can reveal details of paleo-environmental conditions the theory will be tested on natural gypsum collected from selected areas in White Sands National Monument, New Mexico. The study is currently ongoing but the full dataset will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Central and eastern United States (CEUS) is considered to be less seismically active compared with western United States; however, these few earthquakes are felt over much larger distances and have the potential to cause damages over a very large area. The earthquake ground motions vary due to the site conditions that effect strongly the propagation and localized amplification of regional seismic waves. Lg, is the most destructive regional phase for stable continental paths due to its large amplitudes due to low attenuation. The United States combined seismic network that includes EarthScope Transportable Array (TA), offer excellent station coverage for all of the CEUS. The availability of regional and local seismic records provided the resources to study and understand the characteristics of the site amplification of high frequency regional waves. The goal of this project to understand the physical characteristics of regional high frequency phases and the factors effecting these phases. We have used 40 earthquakes with magnitudes between 4 and 5 Mw and distances range between 20 – 2000 km. We collected approximately 8000 seismograms recorded on Transport Array (TA) component of USArray. We employed to methods to estimate the site effect: Nakamura technique (Nakamura, 1989), Horizontal over vertical spectral ratio (HVSR), applied on the shear wave part of seismic event and on the ambient noise. We also employed a Reverse two station method (RTS), which eliminates the source effect and includes the attenuation factor Q in calculating the site response (Chun et al., 1987). In order to correlate the site effect results, the shear wave velocity was calculated for each TA stations by modeling Horizontal/ vertical ratio of the first part of the P waves. The comparison between the two methods suggests we are able to estimate regional variations in site amplification of regional waves. Comparisons of this site amplification with Vs30m suggest that there is only a weak correlation with site amplification. The assumption that Vs30m provides a robust estimate of the site response was based on the data coming from western United States (Borcherdt, 1992, 1994); however, we do not see as good of correlation between site affect and Vs30.",

            "abstract": "As the only subaerial exposure of a ridge – ridge – ridge triple junction, the Afar region of Ethiopia and Djibouti offers a rare opportunity to assess strain partitioning within this type of triple junction. Here, the plate boundaries do not link discretely, but rather the East African rift meets the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifts in a zone of diffuse normal faulting characterized by a lack of magmatic activity, referred to as the central Afar.\nAn initial assessment of Late Quaternary strain partitioning is based on faulted landforms in the Dobe – Hanle graben system in Ethiopia and Djibouti. These two extensional basins are connected by an imbricated accommodation zone. Several fault scarps occur within terraces formed during the last highstand of Lake Dobe, around 5 ka – they provide a means of calibrating a numerical model of fault scarp degradation. Additional timing constraints will be provided by pending exposure ages. The spreading rates of both grabens are equivalent, however in Dobe graben, extension is partitioned 2:1 between northern, south dipping faults and the southern, north dipping fault. Extension in Hanle graben is primarily focused on the north dipping Hanle fault. On the north margin of Dobe graben, the boundary fault bifurcates, where the basin-bordering fault displays a significantly higher modeled uplift rate than the more distal fault, suggesting a basinward propagation of faulting. On the southern Dobe fault, surveyed fault scarps have ages ranging from 30 – 5 ka with uplift rates of 0.71, 0.47, and 0.68 mm/yr, suggesting no secular variation in slip rates from the late Plestocene through the Holocene. These rates are converted into horizontal stretching estimates, which are compared with regional strain estimated from velocities of relatively sparse GPS data.",

            "abstract": "A number of methods to calculate probabilities of major earthquakes have recently been proposed. Most of these methods depend upon understanding patterns of small earthquakes preceding the large events. For example, the Natural Time Weibull method for earthquake forecasting (see\nwww.openhazards.com\n) is based on the assumption that large earthquakes complete the Gutenberg-Richter scaling relation defined by the smallest earthquakes. Here we examine the scaling patterns of small earthquakes having magnitudes between cycles of large earthquakes. For example, in the region of California-Nevada between longitudes -130 to -114 degrees W, and latitudes 32 to 45 degrees North, we find 79 earthquakes having magnitudes M6 during the time interval 1933 – present, culminating with the most recent event, the M6.0 Napa, California earthquake of August 24, 2014. Thus we have 78 complete cycles of large earthquakes in this region. After compiling and stacking the smaller events occurring between the large events, we find a characteristic pattern of scaling for the smaller events. This pattern shows a scaling relation for the smallest earthquakes up to about 3<M4.5, and a deficit of intermediate magnitude earthquakes for 4.5<M<6. b-value for the small magnitude scaling line are 0.85 for the entire interval 1933- present. Extrapolation of the small-magnitude scaling line indicates that the average cycle tends to be completed by a large earthquake having M~6.4. In addition, statistics indicate that departure of the successive earthquake cycles from their average pattern can be characterized by Coefficients of Variability and other measures. We discuss these ideas and apply them not only to California, but also to other seismically active areas in the world",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimatologists use pseudocorals and forward modeling of coral oxygen isotopes (δ18O) to assess δ18O variations for comparison with climate model output in order to understand past tropical oceanic-atmospheric variability. Oxygen isotopic (δ18Ocoral) variability in shallow water coral skeletons is dependent on sea surface temperature (SST) and δ18O of seawater (δ18Osw), which varies with sea surface salinity (SSS). However, measurements of δ18Osw and SSS are sparse; therefore, simulated SSS (e.g., SODA) is typically used in pseudocoral investigations. Our study site is the Dry Tortugas National Park (DRTO; 24º42'N, 82º48'W) in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) where hourly SST and SSS measurements are available from NOAA buoys (1992–2002) and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS; 2011–2014). Here we use bivariate forward modeling of monthly average buoy SSS and SST to develop a time series of pseudocoral δ18O (δ18Op = –0.22(‰/ºC)SST + 0.11(‰/psu)SSS) for DRTO that are compared with δ18Ocoral variations from three Siderastrea siderea coral colonies growing in close proximity within the park. We use the relationship for δ18Osw and SSS determined for Flower Garden Banks coral reef in the northern GOM (27º52'N, 93º49'W) since no measurements of δ18Osw are currently available for DRTO. δ18Op co-varies with δ18Ocoral (r2 = 0.59) with a root mean square error (RMSE = 0.32‰) greater than the intercolony δ18Ocoral variability (r2 = 0.80; RSME = 0.07‰). Discrepancies between δ18Op and δ18Ocoral may be related to the lack of a local SSS-δ18Osw relationship for DRTO or uncertainties in subannual time assignment for δ18Ocoral. A new source of SSS is the NASA satellite Aquarius (2012–2014), which may be useful in future pseudocoral studies, that is evaluated along with high resolution simulated SSS (Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis GLORYS2V3; 1993–2012). We find similar correlation between Aquarius-derived SSS and FKNMS SSS (r2 = 0.68; RMSE = 0.24 psu) and between simulated SSS and buoy SSS (r2 = 0.68; RMSE = 0.35 psu).",

            "abstract": "Jupiter’s moon Io is characterized by vigorous and diverse silicate and sulfurous volcanism. Volcanotectonic depressions called paterae often host eruptive activity including lava lakes and confined flows. Paterae resemble terrestrial calderas, but may have a distinct origin. Keszthelyi et al. [2004, Icarus 169, 271-286] suggested that they are depressions formed when the heat from a sill melts and sublimates a crustal layer rich in volatile S and SO2. A prediction of this model is that the near-vertical, 1-2 km patera walls are rich in volatiles. Here we explore the consequences of this hypothesis using a numerical model for the heating of volatile slopes. The heat conduction equation is solved in one dimension for a sloped surface with inputs from time-varying solar and Jovian radiation as well as radiant heat from a lava flow at the base of the slope. Two end-members are considered: (1) an instantly-emplaced infinitely wide flow that cools rapidly, and (2) a steady-state lava surface characterized by some resurfacing or turnover timescale. Temperature-dependent thermophysical properties and latent heat effects are included.\nWe investigate the heating of steep (70 degree) S- and SO2-rich slopes. Within a nominal parameter range early in the instantly-emplaced lava flow scenario, S-rich slopes briefly reach the melting point. However, this is unlikely to be realistic. The steady-state case results in heating of the walls, and can undergo significant sublimation and even melting if the turnover time is short (hours). In either case, lava heating is likely to soften sulfur-rich walls to a depth dependent on the heating timescale, which could destabilize slopes that would otherwise be stable. An SO2-rich slope under the same conditions undergoes enough sublimation to cause meters of wall retreat per year, and possibly serve as an important local source of SO2 vapor.\nThis work is funded by NASA PGG grant #NNH14AX97I.",

            "abstract": "One of the most dramatic recent changes in Arctic climate is the reduction in sea ice, particularly in the autumn in the western Arctic. This work considers the anomalous sensible heat to the atmosphere from this additional open water. Initial results analyze this additional heat and resulting changes in temperature and circulation both locally, within the Arctic, and at lower latitudes in autumn throughout the winter. Results show the anomalous additional heat in the western Arctic persists in the area for 2 months. Comparisons of northern hemisphere surface circulation between positive and negative anomalies of sensible heat show stronger low pressure centered near the Gulf of Alaska with high pressure centered in the Laptev Sea for positive heating (from the surface to the atmosphere) and a largely opposite signal occurs for negative heating. Elevated near surface temperatures for anomalously large heating to the atmosphere occur in the western Arctic around the ocean periphery to the GIN Seas which persist, particularly in the GIN Seas area, through late winter. The initial mid-level circulation signal (500mb heights) to anomalous heating is lower heights over the western Arctic into Alaska and northwestern Canada, ridging in the southwest US, and high pressure over the Laptev/Kara/Barents Seas. A persistent Rossby wave signal then persists into winter with lower heights over the western Arctic into Alaska and down the western North American coast as well as over Europe with higher heights over the Aleutian Islands, northeastern Canada, and northeastern Russia centered near the Barents Sea.",

To study the effects that future sea-level increases will have on saltwater intrusion in the Biscayne aquifer in Broward County, Florida, a three-dimensional, variable-density, groundwater-flow and transport model was developed. The model was calibrated to observed groundwater heads and chloride concentrations for a 62-year period that includes historic increases in sea level, development of a surface-water management system to control flooding, and increases in groundwater withdrawals as the area transitioned from agricultural to urban land uses.\nSensitivity analyses indicate that downward leakage of saltwater from coastal canals and creeks was the primary source of saltwater to the Biscayne aquifer during the last 62-years in areas where the surface-water system is not actively managed and is tidally influenced. In areas removed from the coastal canals and creeks or under active surface-water management, historic groundwater withdrawals were the primary cause of saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. Simulation of future conditions suggests that possible increases in sea level will result in additional saltwater intrusion. Model scenarios suggest that additional saltwater intrusion will be greatest in areas where coastal canals and creeks were historically the primary source of seawater. Future saltwater intrusion in those areas, however, may be reduced by relocation of salinity-control structures.",

            "abstract": "Heinrich events are among the most prominent climate change events recorded in proxies across the northern hemisphere. They are the archetype of ice sheet — climate interactions on millennial time scales. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms that cause Heinrich events are still under discussion, and their climatic consequences are far from being fully understood. We contribute to answering the open questions by studying Heinrich events in a coupled ice sheet model (ISM) atmosphere-ocean-vegetation general circulation model (AOVGCM) framework, where this variability occurs as part of the model generated internal variability.\nThe setup consists of a northern hemisphere setup of the modified Parallel Ice Sheet Model (mPISM) coupled to the global AOVGCM ECHAM5/MPIOM/LPJ. The simulations were performed fully coupled and with transient orbital and greenhouse gas forcing. They span from several millennia before the last glacial maximum into the deglaciation. We analyze simulations where the ISM is coupled asynchronously to the AOVGCM and simulations where the ISM and the ocean model are coupled synchronously and the atmosphere model is coupled asynchronously to them.\nThe modeled Heinrich events show a marked influence of the ice discharge on the Atlantic circulation and heat transport.",

            "abstract": "Herbivore species such as elk and deer depend on the availability of herbaceous plants and deciduous shrubs for forage. These vegetation types are most nutritious for herbivores during the early part of the growing season, so characterizing spring vegetation phenology over decades can provide crucial information towards understanding how shifts in climate could affect animal behavior and health. Many studies have shown that spring vegetation growth is sensitive to temperature, but less research exists on the influence of drought on phenology. We tested hypotheses on the interactions of recent drought and the phenology of forage utilized by herbivores across the state of Wyoming, USA. Phenological indicators, including the start of season time (SOST), the time of maximum change (in greenness response) (MCT), length of the green-up window (GUW: days from SOST to time of peak greenness), and early spring window (ESW: days from the SOST to the MCT) developed from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery at 250-m resolution, provided broad coverage of the temporal and spatial characteristics of green-up cycles. Gridded precipitation data generated with the Precipitation-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) were used to characterize drought conditions at a coarser spatial scale. We found evidence to prove an initial hypothesis that drought advanced spring development. Spring drought conditions were statistically related to advanced vegetation green-up in SOST and MCT variables, especially across higher elevations and in forested land cover, as well as in some shrublands and grasslands. We did not find evidence that drought made green-up occur faster (based on GUW and ESW variables), although the ESW showed slight acceleration across the northern third of Wyoming. We are further investigating whether the phenological signal of vegetation in more arid areas has been too subtle to detect a significant response to drought.",

Temperatures from the most recent reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA, JRA55, and CFSR) agree well seasonally and latitudinally below 10 hPa during both the TOVS (1979-1998) and ATOVS (1998-present) periods. Above 10 hPa differences exist for various reasons and are different for the TOVS and ATOVS periods. For validation we will use different non-assimilated observations available during the time span of most reanalyses. Rocketsondes were more numerous during the TOVS period. Lidar observations became more common in the mid 1990’s which spans both TOVS and ATOVS. SABER (2002-present) and Aura MLS (2004-present) observations are available for the ATOVS period.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric gravity waves, which are disturbances to the atmospheric density structure with restoring forces of gravity and buoyancy, represent the principal form of energy exchange between the lower and upper atmosphere. Wave breaking drives the mean upper-atmospheric circulation, driving coupled processes that in turn influence weather and climate patterns throughout the atmosphere on various spatial and temporal scales. Very little is known about upper-level gravity wave characteristics, mainly for lack of global, high-resolution observations from satellite observing systems. Consequently, representations of wave-related processes in global models at present are crude, highly parameterized, and poorly constrained. Shortly after launch of the NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership environmental satellite instrument, it was discovered that its Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiomter Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) was able to observe clouds on moonless nights using the reflection of downwelling nightglow—light emitted from a geometrically thin and tenuous emission layer residing near the mesopause (~85-95 km AMSL). Following this revelation, it was discovered that the DNB also held the further ability to resolve gravity structures within the nightglow direct emissions. On moonless nights, the DNB provides all-weather viewing of these waves at unprecedented 0.74 km horizontal resolution as they modulate the temperature and density structure (and hence brightness) of the nightglow layer. The waves are launched by a variety of physical mechanisms, ranging from terrain, to convective storms, to jet streams and strong wind shear, and even seismic and volcanic events. We cross-reference DNB imagery with thermal infrared imagery to discern nightglow wave structures and attribute their sources. The capability stands to advance our basic understanding of a critical yet poorly constrained driver of the general atmospheric circulation.",

            "abstract": "Armoring is the development of a coarse surface layer of sediments on a river bed, which overlies a smaller and typically more heterogeneous substrate. All existing models for this phenomenon are predicated on the idea that armoring develops due to size-selective transport and kinetic sieving at the surface of the granular bed. Here examine the development of armoring in the absence of size-selective surface transport, and demonstrate that subsurface particle movement can create an armored surface layer. We first conduct experiments in a laminar and annular flume, over a range of Shields stresses, with bimodal and refractive index-matched spherical sediments; this allows us to image the internal motion of the granular bed that is sheared from above by a viscous oil. Fluid-driven particle motion of the surface layer results in granular shear, that drives motion deep into the bed. This subsurface motion causes an upward migration of coarser particles, at a rate that is proportional to the granular shear rate. Comparison of experimental results to an existing continuum-granular flow model suggest that armoring in our bed-load exeriments is entirely consistent with shear-induced segregation in dry avalanches - but is slower. There is no size-selective transport at the surface in the experiments, as the annular flume is mass conserving and all particles move as bed load; this was confirmed by observation. To probe the granular physics of armor development further, we perform numerical simulations using a discrete element model (DEM) of granular flow, with and without damping. Simulations reproduce salient features of the experiments, and indicate that armoring is robust but that the rate of segregation is related to the degree of viscous damping. We posit that subsurface granular flow is an important and perhaps dominant contributor to surface armoring in rivers. More generally, this work shows how information is transferred from the surface to the subsurface and back again, through the structure and motion of the sedimentary bed; and it suggests that the granular physics of sediment transport cannot be neglected.",

The reported effects of less accurate receivers are greater residual uncertainty in models of relationships but no substantive effects on the accuracy of large area estimates based on the model predictions. For two temperate forest study areas, one in Norway and one in Minnesota, the effects of GPS error on models of relationships and subsequent large area estimates were investigated using a combination of metrics obtained for plots located with GPS receivers with different accuracies and metrics associated with plots whose locations had been perturbed using simulation techniques. The results suggest that contrary to previously reported results, GPS error induces bias into estimation procedures.",

Microbes make up only a few percent of total SOM, but have a disproportionate impact on SOM cycling. Their direct interactions with soil minerals, however, are not well characterized. We studied colonization of fresh minerals by soil microbes in an Avena barbata (wild oat) California grassland soil microcosm. Examining quartz, ferrihydrite, kaolinite, and the heavy fraction of the native soil, we asked: (1) Do different minerals select for different communities, or do random processes drive the colonization of fresh minerals? (2) What factors influence which taxa colonize fresh minerals? After incubating mesh bags (<18 µm) of minerals buried next to actively growing plant roots for 2 months, we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS2 genes to characterize the microbial communities colonizing the minerals. We found significant differences between the microbial community composition of different minerals and soil for both bacteria and fungi. We found a higher relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhial fungi with ferrihydrite and quartz, and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging of these minerals suggests that some fungal hyphae are moving C directly from roots to mineral surfaces. The enriched presence of both nematode-associated fungi (Pochonia sp.) and bacteria (Candidatus Xiphinematobacter) in the minerals suggests that these minerals may be a habitat for nematodes. Bacteria of the family Chitinophagaceae and genus Janthinobacterium were significantly enriched on both ferrihydrite and quartz minerals, both of which may interact with colonizing fungi. These findings suggest that: (1) Microbial colonization of fresh minerals is not a fully passive or neutral process. (2) Mineral exploration by plant-associated fungi and soil fauna transport may be factors in determining the initial colonization of minerals and subsequent C protection.",

            "abstract": "Oil and natural gas from tight sand and shale formations has increased strongly over the last decade. This increased production has been associated with emissions of methane, non-methane hydrocarbons and other trace gases to the atmosphere, which are concerns for air quality, climate and air toxics.\nThe NOAA Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNEX) aircraft campaign took place in 2015, when the NOAA WP-3 aircraft conducted 20 research flights between March 19 and April 27, 2015 in the following shale gas regions: Denver-Julesberg, Uintah, Upper Green River, San Juan, Bakken, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Woodford, and Permian. The NOAA P3 was equipped with an extensive set of gas phase measurements, including instruments for methane, ethane, CO, CO2, a new H3O+CIMS, canister and cartridge samples for VOCs, HCHO, glyoxal, HNO3, NH3, NOx, NOy, PANs, ozone, and SO2. Aerosol number and size distributions were also measured.\nThis presentation will focus on an overview of all the measurements onboard the NOAA WP-3 aircraft and discuss the differences between the shale gas regions. Due to a drop in oil prices, drilling for oil decreased in the months prior to the mission, but nevertheless the production of oil and natural gas were near the all-time high. Many of the shale gas basins investigated during SONGNEX have quite different characteristics. For example, the Permian Basin is a well-established field, whereas the Eagle Ford and the Bakken saw an almost exponential increase in production over the last few years. The basins differ by the relative amounts of natural gas versus oil that is being produced. Previous work had shown a large variability in methane emissions relative to the production (leak rate) between different basins. By including more and qualitatively different basins during SONGNEX, the study has provided an extensive data set to address how emissions depend on raw gas composition, extraction techniques and regulation. The influence of these differences on the emission will be investigated by looking at average mixing ratios of all the measured trace species. Finally, other emissions sources that were measured during SONGNEX such as the crude oil storage in Cushing, OK, coal mining, biogenics, and biomass burning from small agricultural fires and long range transport from Russia will be briefly discussed.",

After initial identification and mapping of pastures, herd data (class and number of animals) are input on a mobile device in the field with a graphical pasture interface, stored in the cloud, and linked via the web to a personal computer for inventory tracking and analysis. Pasture use calculated on an animal basis provides quantifiable data regarding carrying capacity and subsequent beef production to provide more accurate data inputs for beef sustainability lifecycle analysis. After initial testing by university range scientists and ranchers we have enhanced the BeefTracker application to work when cell service is unavailable and to improve automation for increased ease of use. Thus far experiences with BeefTracker have been largely positive, due to livestock producers’ perception of the need for this type of software application and its intuitive interface. We are now in the process of education to increase its use throughout the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Harrat Rahat is a large (~20,000 km2) alkalic volcanic field located in central western Saudi Arabia. A variety of eruptive products ranging from alkali basalt to trachyte have erupted at Harrat Rahat over the past ~10 m.y., with the most recent eruptions occurring at 641 CE (uncertain) and 1256 CE in the northern part of the volcanic field. Despite the field’s young age and its close proximity to two major city centers, the eruptive history of Harrat Rahat remains poorly constrained. Previous researchers grouped the volcanic strata of northern Harrat Rahat into seven subunits based on limited K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dating, and on the degree of erosion displayed by the eruptive products. The youngest eruptive products (subunits Qm7 – Qm4) are thought to be ≤600 ka, whereas the older lavas (Qm3 – Qm1) are thought to be >600 ka. However, due to the sparse geochronologic control on the ages of the eruptive units, it remains unclear if the currently defined subunits accurately reflect the age distribution of lavas in northern Harrat Rahat. Additionally, the temporal relation between basaltic magmatism and the more evolved eruptive products has yet to be examined. To better constrain the eruptive history of Harrat Rahat we measured >50 new 40Ar/39Ar eruption ages for Qm1 through Qm5 lavas in northern Harrat Rahat. These new 40Ar/39Ar ages suggest that the majority of volcanism in the region occurred ≤400 ka and is significantly younger than previously thought, indicating that the magmatic system at Harrat Rahat has been more active over the past 400 kyr then previously recognized. Additionally, these new age data suggest that nearly all trachytic magmatism occurred <125 ka and was preceded by a pulse of more mafic magmatism. It is likely the magmatic system at Harrat Rahat reached an evolved state late in the history of the volcanic field due to increased and/or prolonged input of basaltic magmas into the crust.",

            "abstract": "Extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EESI-MS) is a direct, real time technique for obtaining mass spectra of gases, liquid droplets, solid particles, and aerosols with little sample processing. EESI-MS involves the interaction of charged electrospray droplets with a separate spray containing the analyte of interest, but the exact mechanism by which the solvent droplets extract analyte from the sample is unclear. Possible mechanisms include complete coalescence of the sample particle with the solvent droplet in which all of the analyte is incorporated into the solvent or a more temporary interaction such that only some of the analyte is transferred to the solvent. Previous studies of the mechanism of EESI-MS on homogeneous particles indicate that both mechanisms are possible. We studied the behavior of EESI-MS toward heterogeneous particles created by coating NaCl particles with various thicknesses of organic diacids. Our results indicate that the signal strength depends on the solubility of the organic acid in the electrospray solvent, in agreement with previous studies, and also that the outer 10-15 nm of the particles are most susceptible to extraction into the electrospray droplets. Our results combined with those of previous studies suggest that the mass spectra obtained with EESI will not necessarily reflect the overall particle composition, especially for particles that are spatially inhomogeneous, and hence caution in interpretation of the data is advised for application to complex atmospheric aerosol.",

            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave directed energy is being investigated to penetrate into deep crystalline basement rock formations to lower well costs and to melt rocks, metals, and other additives to seal wells for applications that include nuclear waste storage and geothermal energy. Laboratory tests have established that intense millimeter-wave (MMW) beams > 1 kW/cm2 can melt and/ or vaporize hard crystalline rocks. In principle this will make it possible to create open boreholes and a method to seal them with a glass/ceramic liner and plug formed from the original rock or with other materials. A 10 kW, 28 GHz commercial (CPI) gyrotron system with a launched beam diameter of about 32 mm was used to heat basalt, granite, limestone, and sandstone specimens to temperatures over 2500 °C to create melts and holes. A calibrated 137 GHz radiometer view, collinear with the heating beam, monitored real time peak rock temperature. A water load surrounding the rock test specimen primarily monitored unabsorbed power at 28 GHz. Power balance analysis of the laboratory observations shows that the temperature rise is limited by radiative heat loss, which would be expected to be trapped in a borehole. The analysis also indicates that the emissivity (absorption efficiency) in the radiated infrared range is lower than the emissivity at 28 GHz, giving the MMW frequency range an important advantage for rock melting. Strength tests on one granite type indicated that heating the rock initially weakens it, but with exposure to higher temperatures the resolidified black glassy product regains strength. Basalt was the easiest to melt and penetrate, if a melt leak path was provided, because of its low viscosity. Full beam holes up to about 50 mm diameter (diffraction increased beam size) were achieved through 30 mm thick basalt and granite specimens. Laboratory experiments to form a seal in an existing hole have also been carried out by melting rock and a simulated steel casing. ",

The particular focus of the study was on the coupling efficiency dependence with Alfven Mach number (MA).\nSince we are studying the instantaneous coupling efficiency instead of the average efficiency over the whole solar wind structure, we needed to take into account the communication time between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. We present the results of the time delay analysis between geomagnetic indices (PCN, AE and SYM-H) and the interplanetary electric field y-component (EY, GSM coordinate system) and Newell and Borovsky functions.\nThe study shows that the MA has a clear effect to the saturation of the PCN index, which can be used as a proxy of the polar cap potential. The higher the MA the higher the limit EY value after which the saturation starts to occur. Thus, the coupling efficiency increases as a function of MA. Also, the AE index saturates during high solar wind driving but the saturation is not MA depended. However, the results also suggest that the MA it is not the primary cause for the PCN saturation.",

            "abstract": "Identification of biotic and abiotic determinants of tree species range limits is critical for understanding the effects of climate change on species distributions. Upward shifts of species distributions in montane areas have been widely reported but there have been few reports of latitudinal range retractions. Previous studies have indicated that southern latitudinal limits of a species range are dictated by biotic factors such as competition while others have suggested that abiotic factors, such as temperature, dictate these limits. We investigated the potential climatic gradients at the southern latitudinal limit of the Spruce (Picea) and Fir (Abies) species that dominate the Canadian boreal forest community as well as relict boreal forests containing similar species found in the high elevation areas of the Southern Appalachians. Existing research has suggested that relict ecosystems are more sensitive to climate change and can be indicative of future changes at latitudinal range limits. Expanding on this literature, we hypothesized that we would see similar gradients in climatic variables at the southern latitudinal limit of the Canadian boreal forest and those in the relict boreal forests southern Appalachians acting as controlling factors of these species distributions. We used forty years of climate data from weather stations along the southern edge of the boreal forest in the Canadian Shield provinces, species distribution data from the Canadian National Forest Inventory, (CNFI) geospatial data from the National Park Service (NPS), and historical weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to perform our analysis. Our results indicate different climate variables act as controls of warm edge range limits of the Canadian boreal forest than those of the relict boreal forest of the southern Appalachians. However, we believe range retractions of the relict forest may be indicative of a more gradual response of similar species across a latitudinal gradient.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the temporal and spatial variation of wetland methane emissions is essential to the estimation of the global methane budget. Our goal for this study is three-fold: (i) to evaluate the wetland methane fluxes simulated in two versions of the Community Land Model, the Carbon-Nitrogen (CN, i.e. CLM4.0) and the Biogeochemistry (BGC, i.e. CLM4.5) versions using the methane emission model CLM4Me¢ so as to determine the sensitivity of the emissions to the underlying carbon model; (ii) to compare the simulated atmospheric methane concentrations to observations, including latitudinal gradients and interannual variability so as to determine the extent to which the atmospheric observations constrain the emissions; (iii) to understand the drivers of seasonal and interannual variability in atmospheric methane concentration. Simulations of the transport and removal of methane use the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM-chem) model in conjunction with CLM4Me¢ methane emissions from both CN and BGC simulations and other methane emission sources from literature. In each case we compare model simulated atmospheric methane concentration with observations. In addition, we simulate the atmospheric concentrations based on the TransCom wetland and rice paddy emissions derived from a different terrestrial ecosystem model VISIT. Our analysis indicates CN wetland methane emissions are higher in tropics and lower in high latitudes than emissions from BGC. CAM-chem model simulations with CLM4Me¢ methane emissions suggest that both prescribed anthropogenic and predicted wetlands methane emissions contribute substantially to seasonal and inter-annual variability in atmospheric methane concentration. Our results suggest that different spatial patterns of wetland emissions can have significant impacts on N-S atmospheric CH4 concentration gradients and growth rates. Our analysis also indicate the existence of large uncertainties in terms of spatial patterns and magnitude of global wetland methane budgets, and that substantial uncertainty comes from the carbon model underlying the methane flux modules.",

The NOAA 19 SBUV/2 and the next generation OMPS Nadir Profiler instruments are currently operational, continuing the record into the future. Profile ozone measurements from eight SBUV-type instruments have been combined to produce a single time series spanning over 40 years. Though the design of each instrument is similar, differences in satellite orbit, calibration, and operational quality lead to offsets and drifts between the data sets that must be accounted for when estimating the overall uncertainty in the merged data record. We use a Monte Carlo modeling approach to estimate the potential for uncertainties in the calibration and drift of individual instruments to mimic long-term variations in the merged data set. We focus on long-term linear trend, solar cycle, and chlorine-induced changes. We use intra-instrument comparisons as well as comparisons with independent data sources to quantify the uncertainty of each instrument in the Monte Carlo simulations. We will show results from a time-series analysis of the SBUV profile MOD data set and discuss the implications of the derived instrumental uncertainties on the resulting uncertainty in trends, solar cycle, and chlorine sensitivity.",

NASA’s latest reprocessing of the individual satellite data sets have created a version 8.6 which strives to eliminate inter-satellite biases. However, there still are differences in data quality between the instruments flown on the various satellites. Our goal is to remove the remaining differences. Adjustments are made to individual instrument records based on periods of overlap, to account for any variations in the observed annual cycle as well as an overall bias. Rather than an average of all available observations, a single satellite is chosen for each period based on the best latitudinal coverage allowing the clean retention of satellite characteristics such as time of measurement, solar zenith angle, etc. to be identified with an ozone value. Measurements from NOAA-9 are included in a short period to allow greater global coverage in the bridge from NOAA-11 to -14. Measurements from the NASA BUV on Nimbus-4 are excluded since there is no overlap with the subsequent instruments. We will present examples of the methodology to adjust overlapping satellites. We will contrast the original unadjusted data set with our final data set. We will present results from applying a piece-wise linear trend to the data set dividing the depletion period from the recovery period.

            "abstract": "Annual breakup of sea ice causes fog in Arctic coastal regions, which can both reduce and enhance glacier melt. With progressive sea ice loss and increasing temperatures and atmospheric moisture in the Arctic, it is essential to determine the frequency and spatial extent of fog in order to understand its present and future effects on glacier mass balance. Previously, we determined Greenland coastal fog to peak with 15-25% of days in July. Here, we present the spatial and vertical extent of significant melt-season fog events over Greenland coastal glaciers and the ice sheet. To this end, we modified a MODIS fog/low stratus detection method by Bendix et al. (2005), with verification by weather and radiosonde data, timelapse and Landsat imagery, and independent fog classifications. Our fog-detection method uses MODIS Levels 1b and 2, processed in an ENVI-ArcGIS environment as follows: 1) visual examination and application of vegetation and snow indices; 2) initial fog/low stratus discrimination with novel band thresholds and cloud products; 3) verification using cloud phase/temperature products; 4) cleaning misclassified pixels; 5) calculating fog/low stratus optical and geometrical thickness; 6) final differentiation of fog from low stratus using edge-pixel detection, trend-surface fitting, and DEM filling. The end product consists of 500 m fog-mask pixel maps over Greenland, with minimum and maximum possible extents based on classification of fog versus low stratus. Our results show that fog can cover extensive areas of the Greenland ice masses. Persistent fog events in early, mid, and late melt-season were extracted for East Greenland using fog rim detection overlain on the GIMP DEM, the Randolph Glacier Inventory, and a coast shapefile. E.g., a 4 July 2002 fog event covers 4300-5000 km2 of ice, with a maximum inland extent of 85 km to an elevation of 1250 m asl.

            "abstract": "TEMPO is now well into its implementation phase, having passed both its Key Decision Point C and the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the instrument. The CDR for the ground systems will occur in March 2016 and the CDR for the Mission component at a later date, after the host spacecraft has been selected. TEMPO is on schedule to measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO measures from Mexico City to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution. TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry. Measurements are from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the inherent high variability in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies.\nTEMPO takes advantage of a GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve O3, NO2, SO2, H2CO, C2H2O2, H2O, aerosols, cloud parameters, and UVB radiation. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O3 in the lowermost troposphere, substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions by 50%. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides near-real-time air quality products that will be made widely, publicly available.\nTEMPO provides much of the atmospheric measurement capability recommended for GEO-CAPE in the 2007 National Research Council Decadal Survey, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond. Instruments from Europe (Sentinel 4) and Asia (GEMS) will form parts of a global GEO constellation for pollution monitoring later this decade, with a major focus on intercontinental pollution transport. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be a component of this constellation",

            "abstract": "Hydrocode simulations suggest that the 1908 Tunguska explosion was a plume-forming airburst analogous to those caused by Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) collisions with Jupiter in 1994. A noctilucent cloud that appeared over Europe following the Tunguska event is similar to post-impact features on Jupiter, consistent with a collapsed plume containing condensation from the vaporized asteroid. Previous workers treated Tunguska as a point explosion and used seismic records, barograms, and extent of fallen trees to determine explosive yield. Estimates were based on scaling laws derived from nuclear weapons data, neglecting directionality, mass, and momentum of the asteroid. This point-source assumption, with other simplifications, led to a significant overestimate.\nTunguska seismic data were consistent with ground motion from a vertical point impulse of 7×1018dyn sec caused by the downward blast wave of a 12.5-megaton nuclear explosion at an altitude of 8.5 km for an effective momentum multiplication factor (β) of ~80. However, simulations of a 3-megaton collisional airburst reveal that the upward-directed momentum contained in a ballistic plume can reach this level within the first minute after the explosion (β≈300). The reaction impulse from such an airburst is therefore similar to a much larger non-plume-forming nuclear explosion. Momentum is coupled through the atmosphere to the surface, generating disproportionately large seismic signatures.\nThis result suggests that coupling from an over-water plume-forming airburst could be a more efficient tsunami source mechanism than a collapsing impact cavity or direct air blast because the characteristic time of the plume is closer to that of a long-period wave in deep water. As the plume accelerates upward, it creates a slowly-rising and sustained overpressure with a ramp wave that propagates outward at the speed of sound, generating a tsunami in deep ocean by the same mechanism that yields slower meteotsunami in shallow basins. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation of prominent internal waves observed propagating radially outward from several SL9 impacts, even though the waves were not in Proudman resonance. Because of slow compression, the SL9 waves grew with a Froude number of ~1.6, the same as that of the sound speed in air over ~4.6-km-deep water.",

Sediment in construction site runoff can be controlled through flocculation using anionic, linear polyacrylamide (PAM), but there is little information on optimizing these applications. We conducted laboratory experiments to determine the optimal mixing times for varying concentrations of two types of polyacrylamide, APS 705 and FA 920, which are blends of polymers with a range of molecular weights that are anionic and neutral, respectively. These were selected from a variety of PAMs previously screened for flocculation potential. Soil from three active construction sites in the Piedmont region of North Carolina were used in the testing. A mixing speed of 300 revolutions per minute (RPM), the maximum available for the paddle mixer we used, was the most effective at reducing turbidity with PAM. Turbidity was reduced with increased mixing times up to a point, after which little additional benefit was evident. For all three soils tested, turbidity decreased as mixing time reached 1-2 minutes at polymer doses of 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1, with no substantial reduction with further mixing. At a polymer dose of 0.5 mg L-1, however, turbidity tended to increase beyond 5 minutes of mixing time, possibly because excessive shear forces destroyed sparsely linked floc. For both PAMs, 1 mg L-1 and a mixing time of 2-3 min appeared to be sufficient to achieve the most effective turbidity reduction.",

JTRF2014 is determined by combining on a weekly basis time series of station positions and Earth Orientation Parameters (EOPs) along with local ties at co-located sites.\nIn the JTRF2014 the temporal evolution of the station positions is formulated by accounting for linear and seasonal terms (annual and semi-annual periodic modes).

Recently, several studies have applied the idea to contemporary landscapes to identify locations that are buffered from climate change effects so as to favor greater persistence of valued resources relative to other areas. Refugia are now being discussed among natural resource agencies as a potential adaptation option in the face of anthropogenic climate change. Using downscaled climate data, we identified hypothetical refugial meadows in the Sierra Nevada and then tested them using survey and genetic data from Belding’s ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi) populations. We predicted that refugial meadows would show higher genetic diversity, higher rates of occupancy and lower rates of extirpation over time. At each step of the research, we worked with managers to ensure the largest impact. Although no panacea, identifying climate change refugia could be an important strategy for prioritizing habitats for management intervention in order to conserve populations. This research was supported by the California LCC, the Northeast Climate Science Center, and NSF.",

It is comprised of 70 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers that occupy 120 sites in total, as well as 27 land-based stations. This array offers a unique opportunity to study the 3D structure of a subduction zone in unprecedented detail. We present the results of an inversion using teleseismic body waves recorded by the Cascadia Initiative, EarthScope, and other regional and temporary networks in the Pacific Northwest. A low-velocity feature is visible beneath the subducting slab at shallow depths. Previous studies report ponding of low-viscosity, buoyant material at the top of the asthenosphere, unable to rise through the impermeable lithospheric lid. We show that as the lithospheric lid descends into the mantle, this material is not advected with it; rather, due to its own weakness and buoyancy, it accumulates at the subduction zone. Such material could be partly responsible for the rapid uplift and volcanism in the Coast Range of California, in the wake of the northward migration of the Mendocino Triple Junction. This newly observed feature may play an important role in the structure of subduction zones, but understanding the extent of that role on a global scale will require amphibious seismic deployments in other subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "The IPCC 5th Assessment found that the predicted warming of 1oC would increase the risk of extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, and floods. Weather extremes, like floods, have shown the vulnerability and susceptibility society has to these extreme weather events, through impacts such as disruption of food production, water supply, health, and damage of infrastructure.\nThis paper examines a new way of near-real time forecasting of precipitation. A 10-year statistical climatological relationship was derived between precipitable water vapor (PWV) and precipitation by using the NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder daily gridded PWV product and the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission daily gridded precipitation total. Forecasting precipitation estimates in real time is dire for flood monitoring and disaster management. Near real time PWV observations from AIRS on Aqua are available through the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Service Center. In addition, PWV observations are available through direct broadcast from the NASA Suomi-NPP ATMS/CrIS instrument, the operational follow on to AIRS. The derived climatological relationship can be applied to create precipitation estimates in near real time by utilizing the direct broadcasting capabilities currently available in the CONUS region.\nThe application of this relationship will be characterized through case-studies by using near real-time NASA AIRS Science Team v6 PWV products and ground-based SuomiNet GPS to estimate the current precipitation potential; the max amount of precipitation that can occur based on the moisture availability. Furthermore, the potential contribution of using the direct broadcasting of the NUCAPS ATMS/CrIS PWV products will be demonstrated. The analysis will highlight the advantages of applying this relationship in near-real time for flash flood monitoring and risk management. Relevance to the NWS River Forecast Centers will be discussed.",

Concurrent measurements from the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment (REPTile) on board Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) CubeSat, in a highly inclined low Earth orbit, and REPT demonstrated that there exist sub-MeV electrons in the inner belt and their flux level is orders of magnitude higher than the background associated with the inner belt protons, while higher energy electron (>1.6 MeV) measurements cannot be distinguished from the background. Analysis on sub-MeV electrons data in the inner belt and slot region from the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) on board Van Allen Probes revealed rather complicated pitch angle distribution of these energetic electrons, with the 90 deg–minimum (butterfly) pitch angle distribution dominating near the magnetic equator. Furthermore, it is clearly shown from MagEIS measurements that 10s – 100s keV electrons are commonly seen penetrating into the inner belt region during geomagnetic active times while protons of similar energies are hardly seen there. These are part of a summary of the most recent measurements and understanding of the dynamics of energetic particles in the inner zone and slot region to be exhibited and discussed in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Wildfire disturbance in northern high latitude regions is an important factor contributing to ecosystem and landscape change. In permafrost influenced terrain, fire may initiate thermokarst development which impacts hydrology, vegetation, wildlife, carbon storage and infrastructure. In this study we differenced two airborne LiDAR datasets that were acquired in the aftermath of the large and severe Anaktuvuk River tundra fire, which in 2007 burned across a proposed road corridor in Arctic Alaska. The 2009 LiDAR dataset was acquired by the Alaska Department of Transportation in preparation for construction of a gravel road that would connect the Dalton Highway with the logistical camp of Umiat. The 2014 LiDAR dataset was acquired by the USGS to quantify potential post-fire thermokarst development over the first seven years following the tundra fire event. By differencing the two 1 m resolution digital terrain models, we measured permafrost thaw subsidence across 34% of the burned tundra area studied, and observed less than 1% in similar, undisturbed tundra terrain units. Ice-rich, yedoma upland terrain was most susceptible to thermokarst development following the disturbance, accounting for 50% of the areal and volumetric change detected, with some locations subsiding more than six meters over the study period. Calculation of rugosity, or surface roughness, in the two datasets showed a doubling in microtopography on average across the burned portion of the study area, with a 340% increase in yedoma upland terrain. An additional LiDAR dataset was acquired in April 2015 to document the role of thermokarst development on enhanced snow accumulation and subsequent snowmelt runoff within the burn area. Our findings will enable future vulnerability assessments of ice-rich permafrost terrain as a result of shifting disturbance regimes. Such assessments are needed to address questions focused on the impact of permafrost degradation on physical, ecological, and socio-economic processes.",

            "abstract": "El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the single most important determinant of variability in global precipitation fields on seasonal to interannual time scales. It is important to understand and predict ENSO and ENSO-related precipitation due to its connection with many environmental and societal problems. However, since ENSO is associated with complex atmosphere-ocean coupling, it is still difficult for models to accurately simulate ENSO and the related precipitation. Our studies focus on comparing the ENSO and its related precipitation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models with the recent developed long-term 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) and the Reconstructed Precipitation (REC), in order to improve the ability of CMIP5 models to simulate ENSO and ENSO-related precipitation mean states and variations during the past century and to further understanding ENSO and the related precipitation. Currently we are using extended EOF (EEOF) to extract the ENSO-related precipitation seasonal evolution signals. The results show that all of models can simulate similar seasonal evolution of ENSO as the REC and the 20CR. We also use a moving block average method to form an ENSO-related precipitation index and use precipitation composites based on this index to compare the multi-decadal changes of the ENSO-related precipitation anomalies among the data. The results suggest that both DJF El Niño- and La Niña- related precipitation patterns and their extremes become significant stronger (on a significant level of 95%) in the 2nd half of the 20th Century in 20CR, REC and few CMIP5 models (e.g. MIROC5). By separating the related frequencies of ENSO into classic ENSO variability (period of 2-7 years) and decadal ENSO variability using a wavelet analysis, we are able to identify that the increase of the ENSO-related precipitation patterns and extremes in REC, 20CR and MIROC5 resides in the significant power increase of their classic ENSO variability. In the near future, we are also going to investigate how sea surface temperature and general atmospheric circulation in each dataset influence the behavior of its ENSO and ENSO-related precipitation, in order to further explain these seasonal and multi-decadal changes mentioned above, as well as the ENSO spatial differences among different datasets.\n ",

            "abstract": "There are two primary strategies that I have pursued over the last decade to engage the media, policy makers, and public; after two decades of typical scientific publication methods. An effective method to engage the media with our ongoing 32 year glacier field research program has been to invite media members to join us in the field. From climate videographers to traditional reporters we have had a member of the media with us in nine of the last ten field seasons; two in 2015. The resulting stories have led to several awards for the journalists and an ongoing relationship with our research program. The second part of this science research communication strategy is to have readily available material on specific topics for the media to utilize; this requires social media outreach. The primary outlet media find is the AGU Blog: From a Glacier’s Perspective. This blog pubishes two articles a week on a specific glacier's response to climate change. The blog yields on average a media contact on every fourth blog post in 2015. The contacts revolve around specific local glacier information published on the blog. The goal of each blog post is to tell a story about how each glacier is impacted by climate change.",

            "abstract": "The AGU Position Statement, “Human-Induced Climate Change Requires Urgent Action,” calls on scientists to “[work] with stakeholders to identify relevant information, and [to convey] understanding clearly and accurately, both to decision makers and to the general public”. Everyday, K-12 teachers communicate with an important segment of the general public, and they represent important stakeholders with unique needs. The terms ‘global warming’, ‘greenhouse effect’, and ‘climate change’ appear nowhere in the 1996 National Science Education Standards, but under the Next Generation Science Standards, millions of teachers– most of whom have little to no experience teaching about climate change– will be required to cover the topic.\nThis presentation discusses research conducted with five veteran public school teachers, each of whom has been teaching about climate change for many years. The group comprises three high school teachers, a middle school teacher, and an elementary school teacher. The study examined: 1) What these teachers teach about climate change; 2) How they teach about climate change; 3) What resources they use in teaching and learning about climate change; and 4) How they think the scientific community can support teachers in their efforts to teach about climate change. The teachers varied in their teaching practices and in their conceptions of ‘climate change’, but they all said that the academic community can support climate change education by developing locally relevant educational resources.\nScientists working with K-12 teachers can build on the work of these master teachers, and attendees can access detailed descriptions of all of the lessons and the associated learning materials.",

            "abstract": "Documenting the history of atmospheric oxygen levels, and the processes that have governed that history, are among the most fundamental of problems in Earth science. Diverse observations from sedimentary petrography, isotope geochemistry, stratigraphy and trace element geochemistry have led to a model wherein concentrations of oxygen experienced two significant rises: the first ‘Great Oxidation Event' near the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, and a second near the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary. Despite ongoing debates over important details in the history of atmospheric O2, there is widespread agreement that the burial and long-term storage of sedimentary organic matter derived from photosynthesis, which represents net O2 production over consumption by respiration, is the primary driver of oxygenation of the atmosphere. In this regard, sedimentation on the continents is vitally important; today, >90% of buried organic matter occurs in sediments deposited on continental crust. Here we use 23,813 rock units, distributed among 949 geographic regions in North America, from the Macrostrat database to constrain patterns of sedimentation through Earth history. Sedimentary packages are low in number in the Archean, increase to a higher steady state value across the transition to the Proterozoic, and rise again across the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary during the final stage in the formation of the Great Unconformity. Map-based data from polar Eurasia and Australia show qualitatively similar macrostratigraphic patterns of sediment abundance. The temporal similarities between continental sedimentation and the putative history of pO2 are sensible in the context of organic carbon burial. A simple model of burial and weathering on North America predicts two significant rises in pO2. These results suggest that the changing ability of the continents to serve as long-term organic carbon storage reservoirs, presumably due to geodynamic processes, has exerted a first-order control on the stepwise oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta hosts a dense network of tidal channels extending inland as far as 100 kilometers from the coast. With semidiurnal tides up to 6.7 meters in amplitude, this setting is ideal for testing hypotheses related to tidal meander morphology, intertidal sediment transport, and channel-platform linkages. We present results from two field surveys in March and September 2015, corresponding to the dry and monsoon seasons, respectively. Comparing acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data and pressure sensor measurements from the Sibsa River in southwest Bangladesh reveals a phase lag of as much as 1 hour between maximum discharge and mean water level. Variations in this phase lag at different points along the channel allow us to test an existing conceptual model of cuspate tidal meander formation. To address a related but separate question, we observe that the ratio of cumulative discharges Qin/Qout is approximately equal during both spring and neap tides at a strategically-placed ADCP transect south of the study area. In contrast, ADCP data obtained north of the study area shows that Qin/Qout=1.4 during spring tides and 0.85 during neap tides. We examine the degree to which this phenomenon is controlled by the establishment of a hydraulic gradient between the Sibsa and a parallel tidal channel, the Pussur, versus the exchange of water between the channel and the tidal flats during the ebb-flood cycle. These results have implications for identifying loci of sediment erosion and deposition within the network.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric longwave radiation is a key source of energy for surface hydrological processes such as snowmelt and evapotranspiration. Many modeling applications estimate this energy flux using empirical parameterizations for atmospheric emissivity that vary with surface conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) and assumed cloud cover. Given that a wide variety of such empirical parameterizations exists, many modeling studies apply different approaches, thereby inducing systematic differences in the simulated surface energy balance. In snow-dominated, mountain basins, sites that observe longwave radiation are rare, and thus it is difficult to discriminate which methods and parameters are most representative. This uncertainty in longwave radiation cascades in complex ways to the modeled hydrology of mountain regions, influencing not only the magnitude of energy available for snowmelt and evapotranspiration, but also the timing of the growing season and the synchrony between local water and energy cycles.\nUsing observations at three well-instrumented mountain sites in maritime, intermountain, and continental climates, we examine how longwave uncertainty propagates through modeled snow processes and summer evapotranspiration. We represent longwave radiation with an ensemble of 400 different approaches for calculating atmospheric emissivity (based on 20 clear sky and 20 cloud correction methods). We find that the daily range typically exceeds 100 W m-2 at all three sites, and that the variability attributed to the cloud-correction is typically greater than or comparable to that of the clear sky method. This longwave uncertainty has significant impacts on modeled mid-winter melt occurrence, peak snow water equivalent (typically +/- 25%), surface energy feedbacks, and snow disappearance timing (1-2 months). We quantify how longwave radiation specifically propagates through each of these components and test the sensitivity of four different snow models to longwave uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is causing unprecedented shifts in forest composition, distribution, and function. Models are capable of capturing ecosystem consequences of these changes on an observable time scale, a century. However, forest processes operate at longer time scales. To better predict how they will respond to climate change, scientists need to understand whether they are simple extrapolations of short-term processes or function in a differently at longer time scales. The PalEON (Paleo-Ecological Observatory Network) project has developed multiple independent paleo-ecological climate and forest composition reconstructions, and millennium length ecosystem model runs to investigate long-term forest processes. If models capture the realities of long-term processes, the model's relationship between climate drivers and vegetation response should match the relationships we see in the data. We used generalized additive models to explore the relationship of independently reconstructed water table depth and gridded forest composition data estimated from networks of fossil pollen data. We calculated that compositional changes are highly correlated with water table depth over centennial time scales. We then tested the relationship between moisture and composition in a 1000 year run of LINKAGES, a model built specifically for understanding long-term forest processes. We found that composition changes have a stronger relationship to centennial scale climate than annual scale climate. The data shows that composition change varies regionally, at a coarse temporal resolution. These changes are not apparent in the model at annual resolution. The modeled composition change is not well constrained in the model at coarser (centennial) resolution, so the data are able to constrain the relationship more than the model by itself. ",

            "abstract": "At many U.S. Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management sites, 100 year natural flushing was selected as a remedial option for groundwater uranium plumes. However, current data indicate that natural flushing is not occurring as quickly as expected and solid-phase and aqueous uranium concentrations are persistent. At the Grand Junction, Colorado office site, column testing was completed on core collected below an area where uranium mill tailings have been removed. The total uranium concentration in this core was 13.2 mg/kg and the column was flushed with laboratory-created water with no uranium and chemistry similar to the nearby Gunnison River. The core was flushed for a total of 91 pore volumes producing a maximum effluent uranium concentration of 6,110 µg/L at 2.1 pore volumes and a minimum uranium concentration of 36.2 µg/L at the final pore volume. These results indicate complex geochemical reactions at small pore volumes and a long tailing affect at greater pore volumes. Stop flow data indicate the occurrence of non-equilibrium processes that create uranium concentration rebound. These data confirm the potential for plume persistence, which is occurring at the field scale. 1D reactive transport modeling was completed using PHREEQC (geochemical model) and calibrated to the column test data manually and using PEST (inverse modeling calibration routine). Processes of sorption, dual porosity with diffusion, mineral dissolution, dispersion, and cation exchange were evaluated separately and in combination. The calibration results indicate that sorption and dual porosity are major processes in explaining the column test data. These processes are also supported by fission track photographs that show solid-phase uranium residing in less mobile pore spaces. These procedures provide valuable information on plume persistence and secondary source processes that may be used to better inform and evaluate remedial strategies, including natural flushing.",

As the scientific culture and funding agencies move towards an expectation that software be open-source, there is a corresponding need for mechanisms to cite software, both to provide credit and recognition to developers, and to aid in discoverability of software and scientific reproducibility.\nWe assess the geodynamic modeling community’s current citation practices by examining more than 300 predominantly self-reported publications utilizing scientific software in the past 5 years that is available through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG). Preliminary results indicate that authors cite and attribute software either through citing (in rank order) peer-reviewed scientific publications, a user’s manual, and/or a paper describing the software code. Attributions maybe found directly in the text, in acknowledgements, in figure captions, or in footnotes. What is considered citable varies widely. Citations predominantly lack software version numbers or persistent identifiers to find the software package. Versioning may be implied through reference to a versioned user manual. Authors sometimes report code features used and whether they have modified the code. As an open-source community, CIG requests that researchers contribute their modifications to the repository. However, such modifications may not be contributed back to a repository code branch, decreasing the chances of discoverability and reproducibility. Survey results through CIG’s Software Attribution for Geoscience Applications (SAGA) project suggest that lack of knowledge, tools, and workflows to cite codes are barriers to effectively implement the emerging citation norms. Generated on-demand attributions on software landing pages and a prototype extensible plug-in to automatically generate attributions in codes are the first steps towards reproducibility.",

The memory contents for every sample, computed at every grid point location, are simply saved at some prescribed temporal frequency. Though straightforward, this approach fails to take advantage of the coherency in neighboring grid points that invariably exists in numerical solutions to mathematical models. Exploiting such coherence is essential to digital multimedia; DVD-Video, digital cameras, streaming movies and audio are all possible today because of transform-based compression schemes that make substantial reductions in data possible by taking advantage of the strong correlation between adjacent samples in both space and time. Such methods can also be exploited to enable progressive data refinement in a manner akin to that used in ubiquitous digital mapping applications: views from far away are shown in coarsened detail to provide context, and can be progressively refined as the user zooms in on a localized region of interest. The NSF funded WASP project aims to provide a common, NetCDF-compatible software framework for supporting wavelet-based, multi-scale, progressive data, enabling interactive exploration of large data sets for the geoscience communities.

Scientific progress on understanding climate is critically dependent on the availability of a reliable infrastructure that promotes data access, management, and provenance. The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) has created such an environment for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). ESGF provides a federated global cyber infrastructure for data access and management of model outputs generated for the IPCC Assessment Reports (AR).\nThe current generation of the ESGF federated grid allows consumers of the data to find and download data with limited capabilities for server-side processing. Since the amount of data for future AR is expected to grow dramatically, ESGF is working on integrating server-side analytics throughout the federation. The ESGF Compute Working Team (CWT) has created a Web Processing Service (WPS) Application Programming Interface (API) to enable access scalable computational resources. The API is the exposure point to high performance computing resources across the federation. Specifically, the API allows users to execute simple operations, such as maximum, minimum, average, and anomalies, on ESGF data without having to download the data. These operations are executed at the ESGF data node site with access to large amounts of parallel computing capabilities. This presentation will highlight the WPS API, its capabilities, provide implementation details, and discuss future developments.",

            "abstract": "Satellite data records spanning the past 3 decades indicate widespread reductions (~0.8-1.3 days decade-1) in mean annual snow cover and frozen season duration across the pan-Arctic domain, coincident with regional climate warming. How the northern soil carbon pool responds to these changes will have a large impact on projected regional and global climate trends. The objective of this study was to assess how northern soil thermal and carbon dynamics respond to changes in surface snow cover and freeze/thaw (F/T) cycles indicated from satellite observations. We developed a coupled permafrost, hydrology and carbon model framework to investigate the sensitivity of soil organic carbon stocks and soil decomposition to recent climate variations across the pan-Arctic region from 1982 to 2010. The model simulations were also evaluated against satellite observation records on snow cover and F/T processes. Our results indicate that surface warming promotes wide-spread soil thawing and active layer deepening due to strong control of surface air temperature on upper (<0.5 m) soil temperatures during the warm season. Earlier spring snowmelt and shorter seasonal snow cover duration with regional warming will mostly likely enhance soil warming in warmer climate zones (mean annual Tair>-5°C) and promote permafrost degradation in these areas. Our results also show that seasonal snow cover has a large impact on soil temperatures, whereby increases in snow cover promote deeper (≥0.5 m) soil layer warming and soil respiration, while inhibiting soil decomposition from surface (≤0.2 m) soil layers, especially in colder climate zones (mean annual Tair≤-10 °C). This non-linear relationship between snow cover and soil decomposition is particularly important in permafrost areas, where a large amount of soil carbon is stored in deep perennial frozen soils that are potentially vulnerable to thawing, with resulting mobilization and accelerated carbon losses from near-term climate change.",

            "abstract": "The current skill of seasonal and long-term sea ice predictions from coupled general circulation models (GCMs) are limited due to insufficient initial conditions, insufficient model physics, and the influence of chaotic atmospheric variability. Since atmospheric variability is a limiting factor in sea ice extent prediction, an improvement in the understanding of the relationship between atmospheric variability and sea ice will help improve seasonal and long-term sea ice forecasting. As a first step to better understand this relationship, we investigate the link between atmospheric variability and sea ice during the summer melt season on seasonal and interannual timescales, facilitated by a connecting (or bridging) physical mechanism. We characterize the summer atmospheric variability by both atmospheric eddy activity and by the two dominant modes of summer Arctic atmospheric variability, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Arctic Dipole (AD). We hypothesize that anomalies in cloud fraction and the cloud liquid/ice water content driven by atmospheric eddies and the AO/AD are an important bridging physical mechanism. Cloud fraction and cloud liquid/ice water content anomalies change the downwelling radiation at the sea ice surface, and thus affect the surface energy budget and sea ice melt. Associated large-scale cloud property anomalies and surface cloud radiative effects are identified using a CloudSAT-CALIPSO-CERES-MODIS fusion cloud data set. Atmospheric eddies are defined in MERRA reanalysis data, and are classified by frequency into high-, low-, and seasonal-scale eddies. Preliminary results suggest that in individual years, high-frequency atmospheric eddies help initiate sea ice melt through associated total downwelling radiation anomalies. These downwelling radiation anomalies are associated with anomalously low and high cloud fraction.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how climate processes facilitate water isotope variability in precipitation over time and space is critical to interpreting isotope-based paleoclimate proxies, particularly in the eastern tropical Pacific where stable water isotope observations from precipitation (δ18Op and δDp) are sparse. Here we present a new 28-month record of daily δ18Op and δDp from Santa Cruz, Galápagos. With a prior 13-year record of monthly averaged precipitation isotope data from the island, these new data reveal valuable information on how meteorology, altitude, and source region characteristics influence the stable isotopic composition of precipitation in the region. Two sampling locations on Santa Cruz Island exhibit distinct local meteoric water lines; the drier, low elevation site (7m a.s.l.) has a significantly lower slope than the humid highland site (180m a.s.l.), likely resulting from greater reevaporation of falling rain. An altitude effect is also apparent, based on daily precipitation and δ18Op measurements across a 35 km transect of the island, with δ18Op decreasing by 0.2‰/100m elevation. HYSPLIT backward trajectory modeling shows air parcels producing rain events with the lowest δ18Op values originated over warmer waters to the north of the Galápagos; rain events with the highest δ18Op originated to the east. This difference provides a mechanism for changes in seasonal mean isotope ratios and shifts in isotope ratios due to systematic circulation changes, such as in association with ENSO phases. Daily δ18Op near sea level was significantly correlated with precipitation amount, as was monthly, amount-weighted δ18Op and precipitation at sea level and 180 m. However, accounting for the non-normality of the data substantially reduces the strength of the correlation between δ18Op and precipitation on monthly timescales while the δ18Op-precipitation relationship on daily timescales remained strong. Overall, we observe a stronger daily, rather than monthly amount effect in the Galápagos dataset. This result suggests Galápagos paleoclimate records which reflect δ18Op may capture a slightly different story than those in the western tropical Pacific, where the amount effect is most strongly manifested on weekly to monthly timescales.",

            "abstract": "Lough et al. (2014) first detected deep sub-icecap magmatic events beneath the Executive Committee Range volcanoes of Marie Byrd Land. Here, we extend the identification and analysis of these events in space and time utilizing subspace detection. Subspace detectors provide a highly effective methodology for studying events within seismic swarms that have similar moment tensor and Green’s function characteristics and are particularly effective for identifying low signal-to-noise events. Marie Byrd Land (MBL) is an extremely remote continental region that is nearly completely covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The southern extent of Marie Byrd Land lies within the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS), which includes the volcanic Executive Committee Range (ECR). The ECR shows north-to-south progression of volcanism across the WARS during the Holocene. In 2013, the POLENET/ANET seismic data identified two swarms of seismic activity in 2010 and 2011. These events have been interpreted as deep, long-period (DLP) earthquakes based on depth (25-40 km) and low frequency content. The DLP events in MBL lie beneath an inferred sub-WAIS volcanic edifice imaged with ice penetrating radar and have been interpreted as a present location of magmatic intrusion. The magmatic swarm activity in MBL provides a promising target for advanced subspace detection and temporal, spatial, and event size analysis of an extensive deep long period earthquake swarm using a remote seismographic network. We utilized a catalog of 1,370 traditionally identified DLP events to construct subspace detectors for the six nearest stations and analyzed two years of data spanning 2010-2011. Association of these detections into events resulted in an approximate ten-fold increase in number of locatable earthquakes. In addition to the two previously identified swarms during early 2010 and early 2011, we find sustained activity throughout the two years of study that includes several previously unidentified periods of heightened activity. Correlation with large global earthquakes suggests that the DLP activity is not sensitive to remote teleseismic triggering.",

            "abstract": "Water shortage most severely restricts the socio-economic development of many arid and semi-arid regions in the world, for which water-saving technology is believed to be an effective solution. However, as a realworld case, the total water consumption of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China continued to increase as irrigation efficiency dramatically improved through the application of water-saving technology in the study period 1998–2010. This phenomenon, known as the irrigation efficiency paradox or Jevons paradox, is interpreted as an economic rebound effect. In this study, we explore the dynamic feedbacks between humans and water in this paradox through a socio-hydrological perspective. We analyze the co-evolutionary trajectory of coupled human–water dynamics from 1950 to 2010 to provide it a general context. A conceptual socio-hydrological model based on five key elements, namely, irrigation land, water-saving technology, water consumption, societal sensitivity to water scarcity, and the policy mix, is constructed. The policy mix to be adopted is determined by a social decision-making process mainly based on the societal sensitivity, which reflects the societal preference on two sorts of policies: (i) irrigation land control and (ii) water-saving technology promotion. Modeling results verify the hypothesized mechanism by successfully reproducing the observed dynamics including the emergence of the efficiency paradox. Our analysis indicates that the implementation of more adaptive rules may even eliminate the paradox. The effects of different initial policy mixes are also explored, and the results show that land control policies should be given equal priority when dealing with water scarcity. These findings point to a double-helix-type co-evolution of humans and water.",

            "abstract": "Discovery of a volcanic front west of Buldir Volcano, the western-most emergent Aleutian volcano, demonstrates that the surface expression of Aleutian volcanism falls below sea level just west of 175.9° E longitude, but is otherwise continuous from mainland Alaska to Kamchatka. The newly discovered sites of western Aleutian seafloor volcanism are the Ingenstrem Depression, a 60 km-long structural depression just west of Buldir, and an unnamed area 300 km further west, referred to as the Western Cones. These locations fall along a volcanic front that stretches from Buldir to Piip Seamount near the Komandorsky Islands. Western Aleutian seafloor volcanic rocks include large quantities of high-silica andesite and dacite, which define a highly calc-alkaline igneous series and carry trace element signatures that are unmistakably subduction-related. This indicates that subducting oceanic lithosphere is present beneath the westernmost Aleutian arc. The rarity of earthquakes below depths of 200 km indicates that the subducting plate is unusually hot. Some seafloor volcanoes are 6-8 km wide at the base, and so are as large as many emergent Aleutian volcanoes. The seafloor volcanoes are submerged in water depths >3000 m because they sit on oceanic lithosphere of the Bering Sea. The volcanic front is thus displaced to the north of the ridge of arc crust that underlies the western Aleutian Islands. This displacement, which developed since approximately 6 Ma when volcanism was last active on the islands, must be a consequence of oblique convergence in a system where the subducting plate and large blocks of arc crust are both moving primarily in an arc-parallel sense. The result is a hot-slab system where low subduction rates probably limit advection of hot mantle to the subarc, and produce a relatively cool and perhaps stagnant mantle wedge. The oceanic setting and highly oblique subduction geometry also severely limit rates of sediment subduction, so the volcanic rocks, which are dominantly high-Mg no. andesite and dacite, have isotopic compositions approaching Pacific MORB. Without recycled sediment and in the absence of an extensive mantle melt component, the geochemical pattern that emerges in western Aleutian volcanic rocks appears to be one derived primarily by partial melting of subducted basalt under eclogite conditions.",

Better estimates of the Q of the Chandler wobble can therefore be used to better understand these processes. Because of them, and in the absence of any excitation process, the amplitude of the Chandler wobble will freely decay with a time constant proportional to its Q. If a period of time can be found during which the Chandler wobble is not being excited but is instead freely decaying, then estimating the time constant associated with this free decay yields an estimate of the Q of the Chandler wobble. Observations of the Chandler wobble indicate that it was apparently freely decaying during the early 1960s. The Q associated with this apparent free decay is 32.5, somewhat lower than estimates of the Chandler wobble’s Q that have been obtained recently by modeling its excitation by atmospheric and oceanic processes. This may indicate that the Chandler wobble was, in fact, not in free decay during the early 1960s or, alternatively, that recent estimates of its Q based on modeling its excitation are biased high.",

Yet, the uncertainty of seismic images, tomograms and other geophysical inferences remains poorly quantified. Fortunately, improved computational capabilities and methods now make possible major advances in quantifying uncertainty. Transdimensional and hierarchical methods, which treat the parameterization and noise characteristics as unknowns to be inferred from the data, are particularly powerful tools for studying uncertainty across geophysical applications. Here, we a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of transdimensional, hierarchical Bayesian inference and present an array of case studies of uncertainty that tackle a range of challenges. We start by characterizing noise on seismograms and illustrate the importance of noise on receiver function estimates. Then, we quantify tradeoffs among physical parameters to which seismic waves are sensitive, in an application of joint inversion of surface wave dispersion, ellipticity, and receiver functions. Finally, we present estimates of errors and smearing in phase velocity maps and travel time tomography, emphasizing the limitations of traditional assumptions of normally-distributed errors in tomography.",

            "abstract": ": For many rivers, the legal allocation of surface water was settled decades ago. The process of apportioning surface water between multiple stakeholders is an arduous process with opposing interests competing for scarce resources. The political capital spent initially allocating a river often cannot be regained, stymieing future attempts for re-allocation. The Colorado River Compact (Compact), signed in 1922, has been “the law of the river” for over 90 years. Since its signing, the Colorado River Basin (CRB) population has increased tenfold, while average river flows have decreased due to threats unforeseeable to Compact signers, such as global climate change. Water sharing agreements, like the Compact, legally re-allocate physical river flows; however, water is increasingly shared through trade rather than aqueducts. Virtual water, or the water embodied by a good or service, is a trade adaption to resource scarcity, namely water and land. This study presents findings of a virtual water complement to the Compact. The goal of this study is to determine how the legal allocation of physical water resources are re-allocated as virtual water via economic trade in a shared river basin. Results are presented by at the sub-basin, state, and county-level, showing the geographic origin and destination of virtual water from CRB states and the Upper and Lower basins. A water stress index is calculated to show the indirect water stress of Colorado River water resources and network statistics are employed to rank the importance of virtual water sources in the CRB.",

            "abstract": "Previously, we reported the application of a “weather situation” dependent multi-model blending approach to improve the forecast accuracy of solar irradiance and other atmospheric parameters. The approach uses machine-learning techniques to classify “weather situations” by a set of atmospheric parameters. The “weather situation” classification is location-dependent and each “weather situation” has characteristic forecast errors from a set of individual input numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The input models are thus corrected or combined differently for different “weather situations” to minimize the overall forecast error.\nWhile the original implementation of the model-blending is applicable to only point-like locations having historical data of both measurements and forecasts, here we extend the approach to provide two-dimensional (2D) gridded forecasts. An experimental 2D forecasting system has been set up to provide gridded forecasts of solar irradiance (global horizontal irradiance), temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the contiguous United States (CONUS). Validation results show around 30% enhancement of 0 to 48 hour ahead solar irradiance forecast accuracy compared to the best input NWP model. The forecasting system may be leveraged by other site- or region-specific solar energy forecast products.\nTo enable the 2D forecasting system, historical solar irradiance measurements from around 1,600 selected sites of the remote automated weather stations (RAWS) network have been employed. The CONUS was divided into smaller sub-regions, each containing a group of 10 to 20 RAWS sites. A group of sites, as classified by statistical analysis, have similar “weather patterns”, i.e. the NWPs have similar “weather situation” dependent forecast errors for all sites in a group. The model-blending trained by the historical data from a group of sites is then applied for all locations in the corresponding sub-region. We discuss some key techniques developed for setting up the 2D forecasting system including machine-learning based methods for RAWS site classification and for automatically excluding erroneous measurement data.\nThe work is partially supported by the US Department of Energy SunShot Initiative (Contract #DE-EE0006017).",

            "abstract": "We re-evaluate the early evolution of an organic-matter rich (~10 wt. %) interplanetary dust particle flux to early Mars. Our work builds upon physical models that rely on plausible sources of exogenous debris and their dynamical rates of decay, the martian cratering record, and preservation of Noachian-Hesperian sedimentary units that have the potential to host organics. Post primary-accretionary scenarios that would have delivered abundant exogenous carbon to Mars can be imagined in two ways: a simple exponential decay with an approximately 100 Myr half-life, or as a “Sawtooth” timeline characterized by both faster-than-exponential decay from primary accretion and reduced total delivered mass. Indications are that a late bombardment spike was superposed on an otherwise broadly monotonic decline from primary accretion, of which two types are explored: a classical “Late Heavy Bombardment” (LHB) peak of impactors centered at ca. 3950 Ma and lasting 100 Myr, and a protracted bombardment typified by a sudden increase in impactor flux at ca. 4240-4100 Ma with a correspondingly longer decay time (400 Myr). Numerical models for each of the four bombardment scenarios explored in this work shows that exogenous organic matter could be a significant component of Noachian (ca. 4200-3700 Ma) and pre-Noachian (4500-4200 Ma) sediments. The discovery of organic-matter in martian sediments will be obfuscated by material of extra-areological origin. We predict that an earmark for the origin of this carbon would be correlated siderophile element abundances (e.g. Ni, Cr, and the platinoids). A time-dependent compositional relationship of C:HSEs would allow us to derive a chemochronology for pre-Hesperian (pre-3700 Ma) sedimentary units.",

            "abstract": "The sources and paths of meltwater drainage into the North Atlantic Ocean at the time of the Younger Dryas (YD) are still debated. The eastern route implied drainage from glacial Lake Agassiz and predecessor lakes along the southeastern edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the North Atlantic Ocean, via the St. Lawrence River. A northern drainage route, along which meltwater reached the North Atlantic via the Arctic Ocean, is presently favoured, but alternate sources of freshwater (icebergs etc.) are also possible. We present evidence for meltwater drainage via the St. Lawrence valley from 8 sediment cores from Cabot Strait, Laurentian Channel, and from the Scotian, Northeast Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves at the time of the YD. Distinct dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are identified during the YD interval and we propose new biostratigraphic markers for the event. Dinoflagellage cysts are also used to reconstruct sea surface conditions. Reconstructions from cores along the eastern route contain strong evidence of lowered salinity within the YD interval, thereby re-establishing the St. Lawrence drainage system as a significant route for inflow of YD meltwater to the North Atlantic. This prompted us to re-examine original data and paleoceanographic interpretation of surface water conditions based on new analysis of dinoflagellate cyst zonation combined with an updated chronology supported by new radiocarbon dates and refined calibrations. Evidence for lowered salinity is also recorded in cores from the NE Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves. Geographical differences in the duration of cold, low salinity conditions associated with the YD event, west and east of Laurentian Channel, suggests another source of freshwater, possibly via the Labrador Current.",

            "abstract": "Organic matter plays a fundamental role in the ecology and biogeochemistry of many ecosystems, from soils to headwater streams to oceans. In most catchments, the terrestrial environment is the dominant source of organic matter for the aquatic system, and thus DOM represents a fundamental linkage between soil and surface water. With trends of increasing DOC concentrations observed in many areas of the world, there is growing interest in identifying which factors drive DOM concentration and chemistry. Studies of systems ranging from tropical rainforests to boreal landscapes have identified many catchment characteristics that co-vary with DOM concentration and chemistry. These include climate elements such as solar radiation and precipitation patterns, chemical measurements such as sulfate or chloride concentration, and land use impacts such as percent agriculture. The question of which catchment characteristics actually control DOM can be broken down into two parts: which factors control the production of mobile DOM and what drives DOM transport from the terrestrial to the aquatic system.\nHere we review studies covering a range of ecosystems, scales, and measurement techniques, to categorize the major state factors that drive catchment controls of aquatic organic matter. Specifically, we identify three major transport vectors that vary both in their timing of DOM transport to surface water and the propensity for DOM originating from terrestrial source areas to be modified during transport. We use this three vector conceptual model of transport to group catchments and identify reproducible signatures of DOM export with varying levels of disturbance.\nBy developing a generalized conceptual model of catchment-scale controls on aquatic organic matter, we can predict how dissolved organic matter will respond to environmental change. This knowledge can then help guide best management practices.",

Using a simple and transparent model that represents committed CO2 emissions (i.e. those embedded in installed capital), we explore the carbon intensity of production related to new capital required for different temperature targets across several thousand scenarios. Future pathways consistent with the 2oC target which allow for continued GDP growth require early action to reduce carbon intensity of new production, and either (i) a short lifetime of energy and industry capital (e.g. early retrofit of coal power plants), or (ii) large negative emissions after 2050 (i.e. rapid development and dissemination of carbon capture and sequestration). To achieve the 2oC target, half of the scenarios indicate a carbon intensity of new production between 33 and 73 g CO2/$ - much lower than the carbon intensities of the best performing countries today. The average lifespan of energy capital (especially power plants), and industry capital, are critical because they commit emissions far into the future and reduce the budget for new capital emissions. Each year of lifetime added to existing, carbon intensive capital, decreases the carbon intensity of new production required to meet a 2°C carbon budget by 1 to 1.5 g CO2/$, and each year of delaying the start of mitigation decreases the required CO2 intensity of new production by 20 to 50 gCO2/$. Constraints on the carbon intensity of new production under a 3°C target are considerably relaxed relative to the 2°C target, but remain daunting in comparison to the carbon intensity of the global economy today.\nFigure Caption: The relationship between GDP per capita growth, lifetime of energy and industry capital and the required carbon intensity of new production 2013-2050 under a 2°C target.",

Whether or not strongly-absorbing BrC is wide-spread globally, and its relative amount to total OA are still unknown. We determine the single scattering albedo (SSA) of OA by combining and analyzing AERONET, MODIS and MISR data. Our observational analysis shows that the OA SSA at 550nm should be < 0.85, at least in the tropics. This low OA SSA is much lower than previously used in climate models, and compels strongly absorbing BrC to represent a significant fraction of OAs over the tropics and probably elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Teleconnection patterns have been demonstrated to impact many aspects of weather and climate on sub-seasonal to interannual timescales, yet their influence on biophysical systems is under explored. Some teleconnection patterns, like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are well known to ecologists and land surface modelers, while others have remained in the realm of atmospheric science. Because teleconnection patterns influence many different aspects of global climate, their impacts on the biosphere are similarly diverse and in many cases contradictory – if a peak in a teleconnection pattern (e.g. an El Nino year) causes cooler temperatures but more rainfall, whether that leads to more or less plant growth will depend on the broader context of the ecosystem. Understanding where and how teleconnection patterns have influenced the biosphere in the past could both improve our understanding of the Earth system and lead to better models. Here we compare a global thirty year satellite record of Leaf Area Index (LAI3g; Zhu et al 2013) to six different teleconnection patterns: ENSO, NAO, the Antarctic Oscillation, the Atlantic Gradient, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Indian Ocean Dipole. We found that while ENSO and NAO do have strong influences on vegetation patterns as has been shown previously, the other teleconnection patterns we considered are comparable in their reach and strength of signal. We also suggest that geographical patterns of correlation like those described here could serve as a ‘second tier’ of benchmarking data for Earth system models – climate models should be able to simulate the biophysical impacts of well-organized modes of climate variability, not just their meteorological dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Planning for adaptation to dynamic risks (e.g., because of climate change) is a critical need. The concept of ‘adaptive policies’ is receiving increasing attention as a way of performing strategic planning that is able to address many of the inherent challenges of uncertainty and dynamic change. Several approaches for developing adaptive policies are available in the literature. One approach, for which several applications already exist, is Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP). Pathway maps enable policy analysts, decision makers, and stakeholders to recognize potential ‘locked-in’ situations and to assess the flexibility, robustness, and efficacy of decision alternatives. Most of the applications of DAPP have been in deltas, coastal cities, or floodplains, often within the context of climate change adaptation.\nIn this talk, we describe the DAPP approach and present a framework for designing signposts as adaptation signals, together with an illustrative application for the Rhine River in the Netherlands. We also draw lessons and challenges from pathways applications that differ in environment, culture, and institutional context. For example, the Dutch Delta Programme has used pathways to identify short-term decisions and long-term policy options. In Bangladesh, an application is in its early phase. Steps before generating pathways – such as long- term thinking in multiple possible futures and acknowledging uncertainties – are already a big challenge there. In New Zealand, the ‘Sustainable Delta Game’ has been used as the catalyst for pathways thinking by two local councils. This has led to its application in decision making for coastal and flood risk management and economic analysis of policy options.",

            "abstract": "Environmental “smog” chambers have played an integral role in atmospheric aerosol research for decades. Recently, many works have demonstrated that the loss of gas-phase material to fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) chamber walls can have significant effects on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yield results. The effects of gas-wall partitioning on highly oxidized species is still controversial, however. In this work we performed a series of experiments examining the losses of oxidized gas-phase compounds that were generated in-situ­ in an environmental chamber. The loss of species to the walls was measured using three chemical ionization mass spectrometry techniques: proton-transfer-reaction (PTR), nitrate (NO3-) ion, and iodide (I-). Many oxidized species have wall loss timescales ranging between 15 to 45 minutes and scale according to the molecule’s estimated saturation concentration c* and functional groups. By comparing results of the different techniques, and in particular by the use of the “wall-less” NO3- source, we find that measuring species with high chamber wall-loss rates is complicated by the use of a standard ion-molecule reaction (IMR) region, as well as long Teflon sampling lines, which can be important sinks for gas-phase species. This effect is observed even for semi-volatile species and could have significant effects on ambient sampling techniques that make highly time-resolved measurements using long sampling lines, such as eddy covariance measurements.",

One case (in IRSN’s Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory) displays a porosity increase in and around the fault core and abundant veins and calcite cemented small faults in the damage zone. The other case (Mont Terri Swisstopo Underground Research Laboratory) displays a porosity decrease in the fault core zone and few veins. However, under the present stress state, the static permeability of the fractured zones at both locations is higher than that of the intact formation by up to 3 orders of magnitude. During borehole pressurization tests three regimes of permeability variations are observed. (1) Fracture permeability first increases progressively as a function of fluid pressure (2) When a threshold is reached, permeability further increases by 100 or more, but strain as well as permeability variations remain in most part reversible. (3) When a steady pressure is maintained in the injection borehole (from 20 minutes to several days) flow rate tends to decrease with time. These results show that high transient permeability may locally occur in a fault zone under conditions when most of the deformation is reversible, opening the possibility of transient fluid migration decoupled from slip along faults that are not favorably oriented. However, during one test, more than 1 mm of irreversible slip occurred along one of the main interfaces, associated with a sudden increase in flow rate (from 11 to more than 40 l/min). This suggests that when slip occurs, it could result in permeability variations that may remain difficult to predict.",

            "abstract": "<span\">A cementitious waste form, Cast Stone, is being evaluated as a possible supplemental waste form for the low activity waste (LAW) at the Hanford Site, which contains significant amounts of radioactive 99Tc and 129I, as part of the tank waste cleanup mission. To improve the retention of Tc and/or I in Cast Stone, materials with a high affinity for Tc and/or I, termed “getters,” can be added to decrease the rate of contaminant release and diffusivity, and improve Cast Stone performance. A series of kinetic batch sorption experiments was performed to determine the effectiveness of the getter materials. Several Tc getters [blast furnace slag, Sn (II) apatite, SnCl2, nanoporous Sn phosphate, KMS-2 (a potassium-metal-sulfide), and Sn(II) hydroxyapatite] and I getters [layered Bi hydroxide, natural argentite mineral, synthetic argentite, Ag-impregnated carbon, and Ag-exchanged zeolite] were tested in different solution media, 18.2 MΩ DI H2O and a caustic LAW waste simulant containing 6.5 M Na or 7.8 M Na. The experiments were conducted at room temperature in the presence or absence of air. Results indicated that most Tc getters (with the exception of KMS-2) performed better in the DI H2O solution than in the 6.5 and 7.8 M Na LAW simulant. In addition, Tc sequestration may be affected by the presence of other redox sensitive elements that were present in the LAW simulant, such as Cr. The Tc getter materials have been examined through various solid-state characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM/EDS, XANES and EXAFS which provided evidence for plausible mechanisms of aqueous Tc removal. The results indicated that the Tc precipitates differ depending on the getter material and that Tc(VII) is reduced to Tc(IV) in most of the getters but to a differing extents. For the I getters, Ag-exchanged zeolite and synthetic argentite were the most effective ones. The other I getters showed limited effectiveness for sorbing I under the high ionic strength and caustic conditions of the LAW simulant.",

In many real world problems, we are interested in these quantities to help us make a decision. Minimizing the uncertainty associated with the quantity can help inform the decision, but a more holistic approach is possible where the experiment is designed to maximize the information that it provides to the decision-making process. The difference is subtle, but it amounts to focusing on the end-goal (the decision) rather than an intermediary (the quantity). We describe one approach to decision-oriented optimal experimental design that utilizes Bayesian-Information-Gap Decision Theory which combines probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods for uncertainty quantification. In this approach, experimental designs that have a high probability of altering the decision are deemed worthwhile. On the other hand, experimental designs that have little chance or no of altering the decision need not be performed.",

These datasets encompass a wide range of temporal and spatial resolutions, suited to specific applications. Now in its 15-year, CERES products are mostly used by climate modeling communities that focus on global mean energetics, meridianal heat transport, and climate trend studies. However, CERES products are now beginning to be used by an even broader audience, like the green energy, health and environmental agencies. With its well-established web-oriented Ordering and Visualization Tool (OVT), CERES products are now much more assessable to users of all communities. The OVT Team introduced a series of specialized functions such as 1- and 2-D histogram, anomaly, deseasonalization, temporal and spatial averaging, side-by-side parameter comparison, and others that made the process of Quality Control far easier and faster. Over time increasingly higher order temporal and spatial resolution products are being made available to the public through the CERES OVT’s web-pages. Moreover, ground site observed surface fluxes are being integrated into the OVT to facilitate the CERES project to QC the CERES computed surface fluxes. These features will give users the opportunity to perform their own comparisons of the CERES computed surface fluxes and observed ground site fluxes. An overview of the CERES OVT basic functions and its QC capabilities, new developments, as well as future steps in expanding its capabilities will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge of the existence and frequency of brief geomagnetic polarity. excursions only increases with time. Precise and accurate 40Ar/39Ar ages will be required to document this, because 25 or more excursions may have occurred within the Brunhes Epoch (780ky) separated in time by as little as 10ky. Excursions are and will dominantly be discovered in mafic, low K2O rocks. Improvements in the analytical protocol to 40Ar/39Ar date low K2O, “young”, and thus low 40Arrad rocks are required. While conventional K/Ar dating “worked”, the assumption of perfect atmospheric equilibration is flawed. In particular, using a measured isochron intercept (±2s) to embrace an atmospheric intercept assumption turns a 40Ar/39Ar diffusive extraction into a series of “K/Ar-lite” experiments. The near ubiquitous excess 40Ar exhibited in final steps of “matrix” or “groundmass” fractions from whole-rock experiments (no glass, crystals) suggests equilibration with the atmosphere is not achieved. Removing magnetic sample splits (glass?) thought subject to poor argon retention, and crystals subject to 40Ar inheritance are routinely done without documenting different isochrons. Short 15 to 20 minute irradiation times effectively eliminate recoil and dramatically minimize isotopic corrections, and the assumption of equivalence in Ar isotope recoil behavior. Assuming no pressure dependency and constancy of mass discrimination value ignores knowledge from other gas mass spectroscopy (O, H, He, Ne). Dynamic mass spectroscopy in stable isotopic analysis allows routine per mil and 0.1 per mil ratios to be measured. Maintaining more than daily bracketing air pipette measurements at differing pressures, and controlling the range of pressures from each diffusive step will approximate this dynamic precision. Experiments will be discussed that exhibit aspects of 40Ar/39Ar dating protocols with which precision and accuracy can be improved.",

            "abstract": "B/Ca and boron isotope proxies recorded in the calcium carbonate shells of planktic foraminifera are sensitive to seawater acidity. We seek to understand how the biology of the organism affects the geochemical signals, as planktic foraminifera shells differ in their chemical composition from inorganic calcite and also between foraminifer species. These differences are most likely related to physiological processes like respiration, calcification, and photosynthesis in symbiont-bearing foraminifera. The modifications of geochemical signals by these biological parameters are termed vital effects.\nOur study is based on the hypothesis that the B/Ca and δ11B offsets observed in planktic foraminifer shells are primarily due to the photosynthetic activity of their symbionts, which may elevate the microenvironmental pH to different degrees in different foraminifer species. Using fast repetition rate fluorometry, chlorophyll α analyses and symbiont counts, we investigated the symbiont-photosynthetic activity associated with three foraminifera species – Globigerinoides ruber, G. sacculifer, and Orbulina universa. Boron proxy systematics in these species suggest that photosynthetic activity should be greater in G. ruber compared to G. sacculifer and O. universa, but this is not confirmed by our study. While symbiont photosynthesis undoubtedly explains microenvironmental pH-elevation and boron proxy systematics in symbiont-bearing compared to symbiont-barren foraminifer species, additional processes must be responsible for the boron geochemical offsets between symbiont-bearing species. Respiration of the symbiont-host association and the calcification process are most likely candidates that require further analysis. Our study highlights the potential danger of misinterpreting geochemical signals in biological organisms when the biology of the organism in question is not entirely understood.",

Environmental gradients affect species' distribution patterns with these responses likely depending on species' functional traits. Thus, tracking shifts in species' traits can provide insight into the mechanisms by which species respond to dynamic environmental conditions. We examined how functional traits are associated with long-term changes in the distribution and abundance of understory plants in Wisconsin forests over the last 50+ years. We relied on detailed surveys and resurveys of the same Wisconsin forest plots, data on 12 functional traits, and site-level environmental variables including soil and climate conditions. We then related changes in the abundance of 293 species across a network of 249 sites to these environmental variables and explored whether functional traits served to predict these relationships using multilevel models. Species abundance patterns were strongly related to variation in environmental conditions among sites, but species appear to be responding to distinct sets of environmental variables. Functional traits only weakly predicted these species-environment relationships, limiting our ability to generalize these results to other systems. Nonetheless, understanding how traits interact with environmental gradients to structure species distribution patterns helps us to disentangle the drivers of ecological change across diverse landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Experimental phase relations of carbonated lithologies [1] and geochemistry of deep diamonds [2] suggest that deep recycling of carbon has likely been efficient for a significant portion of Earth’s history. Both carbonates and organic carbon subduct into the mantle, but with gradual decrease of fO2 with depth [3] most carbon in deep mantle rocks including eclogite could be diamond/graphite [4]. Previous studies investigated the transfer of CO2 from subducted eclogite to the ambient mantle by partial melting in the presence of carbonates, i.e., by generation of carbonate-rich melts [5]. However, the transfer of carbon from subducted eclogite to the mantle can also happen, perhaps more commonly, by extraction of silicate partial melt in the presence of reduced carbon; yet, CO2 solubility in eclogite-derived andesitic melt at graphite/diamond saturation remains unconstrained. CO2content of eclogite melts is also critical as geochemistry of many ocean island basalts suggest the presence of C and eclogite in their source regions [6].\nIn the present study we determine CO2 concentration in a model andesitic melt [7] at graphite/diamond saturation at conditions relevant for partial melting of eclogite in the convecting upper mantle. Piston cylinder and multi anvil experiments were conducted at 1-6 GPa and 1375-1550 °C using Pt/Gr double capsules. Oxygen fugacity was monitored with Pt-Fe sensors in the starting mix. Completed experiments at 1-3 GPa show that CO2 concentration increases with increasing P, T, and fO2 up to ~0.3 wt%. Results were used to develop empirical and thermodynamic models to predict CO2 concentration in partial melts of graphite saturated eclogite. This allowed us to quantify the extent to which CO2 can mobilize from eclogitic heterogeneities at graphite/diamond saturated conditions. With estimates of eclogite contribution to erupted basaltic lavas, the models developed here allow us to put constraints on the flux of CO2 to mantle source regions coming from subducted crust and investigate the possible role this process may play in the deep carbon cycle.\n[1] Dasgupta (2013) RiMG.

Understanding the fluxes of carbon into and out of the atmosphere is a complex and daunting challenge. One tool applied by scientists to measure the vertical flux of CO2 near the surface uses the eddy covariance technique, most often from towers but also from aircraft flying specific patterns over the study area. In this technique, variations of constituents of interest are correlated with fluctuations in the local vertical wind velocity. Measurement requirements are stringent, particularly with regard to precision, sensitivity to small changes, and temporal sampling rate. In addition, many aircraft have limited payload capability, so instrument size, weight, and power consumption are also important considerations.\nWe report on the development and preliminary application of an airborne sensor for the measurement of atmospheric CO2. The instrument, modeled on the successful DLH (Diode Laser Hygrometer) series of instruments, has been tested in the laboratory and on the NASA DC-8 aircraft. Performance parameters such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and temporal response are discussed in the context of typical atmospheric variability and suitability for flux measurement applications. On-aircraft, in-flight intercomparison data have been obtained and will be discussed as well. Performance of the instrument has been promising, and continued flight testing is planned during 2016.",

            "abstract": "The variability of the trend of global mean sea level on decadal scales is of great importance to determining its long-term evolution. How confident can we be in determining if there is acceleration from decade to decade? Trend determination is affected by the temporally correlated processes in the record, which have often not been properly accounted for. The problem is treated as one of optimal estimation weighted by the auto-covariance of the time series, which takes into account the various time scales affecting trend estimation. On decadal scales, the estimated standard error of the trend determined from the global mean sea level record from radar altimetry is about 0.3 mm/yr, which is comparable to the widely quoted 0.4 mm/yr systematic error and cannot be neglected in the error budget. The time scale of the systematic errors is assumed to be much longer than decadal scale, over which the formal error of the trend estimate becomes dominant. The approach is also applied to determining steric sea level from altimeter-measured sea level and ocean mass estimated from the GRACE observations. The estimated trend error of steric sea level, 0.12 mm/yr, suggests that the change of the global ocean heat content over decadal scales can be estimated from space observations to an accuracy on the order of 0.1 W/m2. The difference between of the steric sea level, estimated from Argo plus the estimated contribution from the deep ocean, and that from altimeter and GRACE, 0.18 +/- 0.25 mm/yr, provides an estimate of the combined systematic errors of altimetry minus GRACE observations.",

The BIA provides operations and maintenance support for 16 irrigation systems. To make the best use of limited resources, the BIA must incorporate climate change impacts on hydrology and water management for these irrigation systems in the coming decades. The 16 irrigation projects discussed here are divided into three climatological regions: the Pacific Northwest Region, the Greater Rocky Mountain Region, and the Western, Southwest, & Navajo Region. Significant climate projections that impact irrigation systems in one or more of these regions include increased temperatures and evaporative demand, earlier snowmelt and runoff, an increase in floods, an increase in heavy precipitation events, an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts, and declining water supplies. Some irrigation projects are particularly vulnerable to these climate impacts because they are in already water-stressed areas or areas in which water resources are over-allocated. Other irrigation projects will have to adjust their storage and water management strategies to accommodate changes in the timing of streamflow. Overall, though, the BIA will be better able to assist tribal nations by incorporating expected climate impacts into their water resources management practices.",

            "abstract": "Localized neutral density enhancement in the polar cap above 70o magnetic latitude have been frequently observed during major geomagnetic storms. It has been suggested that energy input responsible for producing localized neutral density spikes is the dominant energy deposition in the polar cap. To better understand the origin of polar cap neutral density anomalies (PCNDAs) we trace magnetic field lines from the polar cap region at about 400 km to the magnetosphere using the data-based Tsyganenko magnetic field model TS05 [Tsyganenko and Sitnov, 2005] for the periods when CHAMP detected PCNDAs during major magnetic storms with the minimum Dst < -100 nT. The magnetopause boundary is specified according to the three-dimensional asymmetric magnetopause model recently developed by Lin et al. [2010]. The closest distance to the magnetopause along the traced field line path is determined as a function of time. The tracing results indicate that depending on Dst and locations PCNDAs could be connected through magnetic field lines either to the nightside magnetopause or to the magnetotail lobe. For some events field lines originating from a portion of the PCNDA region are found to cross the equatorial plane in the near earth tail region. We discuss the results to help elucidate the coupling between the magnetosphere and the thermosphere and its roles in producing polar cap density anomalies. \n",

            "abstract": "Sublimation of snow cover directly affects snow accumulation, impacting ecosystem processes, soil moisture, soil porosity, biogeochemical processes, wildfire, and water resources. Available energy, the exposed surface area of a snow cover, and exposure time with the atmosphere vary greatly in complex terrain (e.g., aspect, elevation, forest cover), with latitude, and with continentality. It is therefore difficult to scale up results from site specific short term studies. Using the 32-km NARR, the 4-km PRISM, with 30-m terrain and forest cover data, meteorological variables are downscaled to simulate sublimation from canopy intercepted snow and from the snowpack over the Salt River Basin in Arizona for a wet and dry year. Simulations indicate that: (1) total sublimation is highly variable in response to variability in both sublimation rate and snow cover duration; (2) total canopy sublimation is similar for both years while ground sublimation is considerably greater during the wet year; (3) sublimation is a relatively greater contribution to the snow water budget during the dry year (28% vs. 20% of total snowfall); (4) at high elevations, ground sublimation is less in open areas than forested areas during the dry year, while the reverse is evident during the wet year as snowpack lasted longer into spring. While a reduction in leaf area index leads to a reduction of total sublimation due to less interception in both years, ground sublimation increases during the dry year, possibly due to less sheltering from solar radiation and wind. This reduction in sheltering results in a large decrease in snowpack duration (i.e., ten days in spring) at mid-elevations for the wet year, leading to a decrease in ground sublimation. This results in a 500 meter difference in the elevation of maximum sublimation reduction upon reduced leaf area index between the two years. Forest cover properties can vary considerably on short and long time scales through natural (wildfire, bark beetle infestation, drought) and anthropogenic (land management practices) processes. Therefore, understanding how small scale changes impact snow sublimation at larger spatial scales, and how this varies temporally, is critical from ecosystem function and water resources perspectives.",

This work covers the entire record of water level changes at each station during spring breakup and focuses on first flow dates, which could reflect changing weather conditions in the area.

            "abstract": "International climate mitigation efforts are focused on limiting increase in global mean temperature, which has been shown to be proportional to cumulative CO2 emissions. However, the ability of natural and human systems to successfully adapt to climatic changes depends on both the magnitude and rate of change, the latter of which will depend on how quickly a given level of cumulative emissions occurs. We show that cumulative CO2 emissions of 4,620 Gt CO2 (reached in 2100 in RCP4.5 and 2057 in RCP8.5) produce globally averaged warming rates that are nearly twice as fast in RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 (0.34±0.08°C per decade versus 0.19±0.05°C per decade, respectively). Similarly, the globally averaged velocity of climate change calculated according to the “nearest equivalent climate” is greater by a factor of ~2 in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5 (2.51±0.67 km y-1 versus 1.32 ± 0.39 km y-1, respectively), despite equivalent cumulative emissions. These differences in the projected velocity of climate change represent uncertainty for ecosystems that may be unable to adapt to the faster changes. Particularly at risk are boreal forests, of which 48% are projected to experience rates of change beyond their expected adaptive capacity (i.e. >0.3°C per decade) in RCP4.5, compared with 95% in RCP8.5. Thus, the same budget of cumulative carbon emissions may result in critically different impacts on natural and human systems, depending on the amount of time over which that budget is expended.",

            "abstract": "Similar to their behavior on the deep extent of some subduction zones, families of recurring low-frequency earthquakes (LFE) within zones of non-volcanic tremor on the San Andreas fault in central California show strong sensitivity to stresses induced by the tides. Taking all of the LFE families collectively, LFEs occur at all levels of the daily tidal stress, and are in phase with the very small, ~200 Pa, shear stress amplitudes while being uncorrelated with the ~2 kPa tidal normal stresses.\nFollowing previous work we assume LFE sources are small, persistent regions that repeatedly fail during shear within a much larger scale, otherwise aseismically creeping fault zone and that the correlation of LFE occurrence reflects modulation of the fault creep rate by the tidal stresses. We examine the predictions of laboratory-observed rate-dependent dilatancy associated with frictional slip. The effect of dilatancy hardening is to damp the slip rate, so high dilatancy under undrained pore pressure reduces modulation of slip rate by the tides. The undrained end-member model produces: 1) no sensitivity to the tidal normal stress, as first suggested in this context by Hawthorne and Rubin [2010], and 2) fault creep rate in phase with the tidal shear stress. Room temperature laboratory-observed values of the dilatancy and friction coefficients for talc, an extremely weak and weakly dilatant material, under-predict the observed San Andreas modulation at least by an order of magnitude owing to too much dilatancy. This may reflect a temperature dependence of the dilatancy and friction coefficients, both of which are expected to be zero at the brittle-ductile transition. The observed tidal modulation constrains the product of the friction and dilatancy coefficients to be at most 5 x 10-7 in the LFE source region, an order of magnitude smaller than observed at room temperature for talc. Alternatively, considering the predictions of a purely rate-dependent talc friction would constrain the ambient effective normal stress to be no more than 40 kPa. In summary, for friction models that have both rate-dependent strength and dilatancy, the observations require intrinsic weakness, low dilatancy, and lithostatic pore fluid pressures.",

            "abstract": "The principal method for remotely sensing forest biomass, particularly high-biomass tropical forests, is to measure vertical structural properties of the forest and relate them to biomass. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and lidar are the two principal technologies applied to this task. InSAR profile information is constrained in the traditional, look-averaged analysis, because it measures the vertical Fourier transform of the radar power at one and only one vertical frequency specified by the baseline. Lidar produces a full profile, including all Fourier frequencies—all vertical scales of fluctuation. In TanDEM-X data over tropical forests at the Tapajos National Forest, Brazil, we show the results of potentially improving InSAR’s Fourier coverage. This is done by estimating many Fourier frequencies with a single baseline, based on the assumption that sampling of the phase height of small (~1.5 m x 2.5 m) looks of TanDEM-X is equivalent to sampling the vertical structure of the forest; a spatial ergodicity. We show a similarity between the distribution of InSAR look-phase-heights (LPH) and lidar and field profiles over 0.25-ha areas. Using Fourier transforms of the histogram of LPH over 0.25 ha areas, biomass estimation improved by about 17% over using InSAR coherence and mean forest height, making it competitive with some lidar results. The RMS of biomasses estimated about field biomass was 48 Mg/ha, with biomasses as high as 430 Mg/ha, and an average of 174 Mg/ha. Perhaps LPH distributions bear a similarity to lidar and field profiles because shorter wavelengths (~3 cm) can penetrate holes in the canopy to scatter off a sample of the vegetation with each look. This “hole mechanism” favors higher frequencies, which are able to penetrate smaller holes. Because they increase the number of look samples, higher bandwidths are also preferred.",

            "abstract": "In many mixed-phase cloud systems, the riming of cloud droplets is a key microphysical process in the growth of precipitation-sized hydrometeors. The relative importance of riming compared to other hydrometeor growth mechanisms depends on the type of cloud system and the mass, size, and number concentration of cloud droplets and ice species. In a perturbed climate state, the nature of deep convection may be altered through changes in the environmental conditions and aerosol concentrations. Such climate-induced variability can modify the dominant microphysical processes that generate precipitation through changes in hydrometeor size spectra. Such changes could either increase or decrease precipitation production and efficiency as well as impact associated morphology of clouds and convection. If the efficiency of the riming process is modified through these climate changes, it can alter the accumulated precipitation, precipitation intensity, spatial and temporal distribution of cloud and ice water, and the radiation budget through the modification of ice spectra and areal coverage of upper-level anvil clouds. The impacts of variability in aerosol concentration and collision efficiencies on the riming process in deep convection is explored through the use of high-resolution cloud resolving model simulations of a squall line that occurred May 20, 2011 over the U.S. central plains during the MC3E field project. Results thus far have demonstrated that changes in the riming rates strongly impact the intensity and partitioning of squall line precipitation between convective and stratiform, the lofting of condensate to upper levels, the vertical distribution of latent heating, and the area and optical thickness of stratiform anvil clouds. Analyses from direct tests of microphysical processes have revealed that a reduction in riming rates leads to less precipitation, greater amounts of lofted cloud water, and greater ice mass in cirrus anvils. Further, an increase in aerosol concentration to moderately high values tends to increase riming rates, which reduces lofted cloud water and leads to less anvil ice mass but greater anvil areal extent due to modified ice spectra.",

            "abstract": "Along the Mexican section of the Middle America Trench (MAT), the Cocos plate subducts beneath the North American plate. The most important feature of this subduction zone is the flat-slab section below central Mexico, extending approximately 250 km landward from the trench at a depth of 50 km. Further west, the dip changes to 45-50º. This particular geometry has several unique consequences, such as a volcanic arc that is not aligned with the trench and very shallow slab seismicity. For the mantle wedge, the abrupt change in slab geometry could lead to a three-dimensional (3D) mantle wedge flow that departs from the classical 2D subduction-driven corner flow. Evidence of 3D flow in the region comes from seismic anisotropy studies, which show that olivine fast-direction axes have a component that is parallel to the MAT. In other subduction zones, such as Costa Rica-Nicaragua and Japan, 3D flow has been observed to increase temperatures by >50º C relative to corner flow models.\nFor this study, we have created the first 3D finite-element model of the Mexican subduction zone in order to analyze its thermal structure. Our objective is to assess the effects of 3D mantle flow and hydrothermal circulation (HC) in the subducting slab. In this region, low surface heat flow values near the trench indicate that HC may remove heat from the oceanic plate. Our model incorporates the effect of HC through conductivity proxies in the subducting crust and a 2D oceanic geotherm that includes the age variations of the Cocos plate along the MAT. For an isoviscous mantle, our model shows that the slab dip variations induce a flow that departs from 2D corner flow near the transition between the flat-slab and normal-dipping sections. The mantle flows in eastward direction toward the flat slab, and its orientation is consistent with seismic anisotropy studies. The maximum along-margin flow rate is nearly 2 cm/yr, which is >30% of the convergence rate. Temperatures at the location of this flow can be as high as 1230º C below the volcanic arc. For a non-Newtonian rheology, previous studies indicate the along-strike component can be significantly higher than for the isoviscous case. Our models will investigate the combined effect of 3D non-Newtonain mantle flow and HC on melting temperatures in the wedge, as well as dehydration and metamorphic reactions within the slab.",

Fluid models of mass, momentum, and energy equations can be used to solve the field-aligned flow of H+ and O+ ions from the ionosphere into the earth’s magnetosphere. Particle-in-cell (PIC) codes, which include kinetic processes, have also treated polar wind flow between an active ionospheric boundary condition and the outflow boundary into the magnetosphere. In study, we compare the O+ and H+ escape fluxes from the USU Ionosphere-Plasmasphere Model (IPM) [Schunk et al., 2003] with the escape fluxes from the macroscopic PIC solution of the Generalized Polar Wind (GPW) Model of Barakat and Schunk [2006]. The IPM model results at 1500km are used to supply the time-varying boundary conditions to the GPW model. The escape flux comparisons will be made at the 2.5 Re, which is a typical boundary condition radius for fluxes into MHD magnetosphere models.\nClassical fluid codes generate escape fluxes driven by the pressure gradients in the ionosphere, while the PIC code has additional energization processes for the polar wind fluxes. Differencing the two escape flux solutions at 2.5 Re will quantify the importance of the additional energization processes within the PIC GPW model. We will make the comparisons of escape fluxes using the model results of 4 different storm periods: an idealized storm period, April 5-8, 2000, 2002 September 27 to October 4, and 2002 October 22-29.

Moore, PMEL, Seattle\nHristina Hristova, JIMAR and PMEL, Seattle\nT.S.Durland, Oregon State University\nJay McCreary, University of Hawaii\nThe theory of linear equatorial waves shows that there is an intermediate frequency band between the highest frequency equatorial Rossby wave (with frequency approximately 0.3) and the lowest frequency equatorial gravity wave (with frequency approximately 1.7). Between these two frequencies the only free waves with real east-west wave number are the equatorial Kelvin wave, and the Yanai (or mixed Rossby-gravity) wave. We previously explored the partition of poleward-propagating, coastal-Kelvin wave energy propagating away from the equator on an eastern boundary when either an equatorial Kelvin wave or a Yanai wave is incident from the west. The coast need not be perpendicular to the equator. All the incident energy goes either north or south along the coast. None goes west along the equator.\nWe now extend the frequency range of the incident Kelvin wave so that it is possible to generate a long Rossby wave as part of the reflection off an eastern boundary which is not normal to the equator. So, for instance, an equatorial Kelvin wave with dimensionless frequency between 0.3 and 1.7 only produces poleward-propagating coastal waves at the eastern boundary. At a dimensionless frequency of 0.25, however, an incident equatorial Kelvin wave will produce a reflected long Rossby wave with a dimensionless wavenumber given by k = −1.75, with westward phase speed and group velocity, sending some energy back to the west along the equator. At the same time there is still coastal-wave energy propagating poleward on the eastern boundary. We explore the partition of energy between poleward-propagating coastal Kelvin waves and the westward-propagating, equatorial long Rossby wave.",

In order to better understand the nature of the lithosphere mantle and origin of the measure seismic velocity anomalies we have made detailed measurements of the uppermost mantle attenuation using the high frequency regional phase Sn.\nIn order to measure Sn attenuation. We have collected a large data set consisting of 18 years (1995-2012) of waveforms recorded by 305 permanent and temporary stations. We used a bandpass filter (0.1-0.5Hz) to identify efficient longer period Sn phases. In order to determine Sn Q we applied a Two Station Method (TSM) and Reverse Two Station Method (RTM) to eliminate the source effects. We have used the LSQR algorithm to tomographically map Sn attenuation tomography across the Middle-East.\nWe also determined the Sn propagation efficiencies visually and tomographically map qualitatively assigned Sn propagation efficiencies across the Middle-East.\nThe Sn Attenuation Tomography show moderately low Q values beneath the Turkish-Iranian Plateau (~250) and high Q values beneath the south Caspian sea (~400) and Arabian shield (~400). We also observe high Q values beneath the Zagros mountains (~450) that is consistent with the Arabian plate underthrusting beneath the Eurasia plate.\nThe Sn Efficiency Tomography shows high attenuation within the Turkish-Iranian Plateau and low attenuation in the Arabian Plate and across the Caspian Sea. This is consistent with prior studies that suggest a hot and thin lithosphere beneath the Turkish-Iranian Plateau and it also suggests that intrinsic attenuation is the dominant component in Sn Q across the Turkish-Iranian Plateau.\nDue to the signal-to-noise criterion to select amplitudes and the efficiency criterion to select two-station and reverse-two-station paths for the inversion, the data are left-censored and the resulting Q models are incomplete in many regions. As a result, we are now working on a technique to predict missing amplitude caused by Sn blockage and thus avoid biasing our Sn Q model.",

            "abstract": "Afforestation has been proposed as a practical and viable solution for curtailing the ever-increasing levels of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere. Individual states and multi-region cooperatives have established initiatives to offset carbon emissions using a variety of strategies, afforestation being one of them. While afforestation provides a positive benefit of increased carbon sequestration, this land cover change also produces a lower surface albedo, which can lead to local warming. Given these competing effects, carbon balance and surface energy budget analyses were performed for the northern United States and southern Canada, to determine where and for how long forest plantations should be planted to provide a positive benefit to the climate system. We use a dynamic vegetation model to analyze the competing effects of increased carbon sequestration versus increased net radiation at the surface from afforestation. In addition to determining where carbon sequestration (biogeochemical) would outweigh albedo (biophysical) effects, we calculate the amount of emissions offset for a variety of land use scenarios. As an example, in the state of Minnesota state officials have mandated that carbon emissions be reduced 80% from 2005 to 2050. While only taking into consideration land that is currently forested by mature forests and grasslands, the state would only offset about 11% of 2005 emissions annually by reforesting this land with younger, more productive forests. This example suggests that a significant amount of agricultural land would need to be converted into forest to make any sizeable offset to statewide greenhouse gas emissions.",

A long-standing partnership with State University of New York’s The College at Brockport gives teachers the opportunity to receive 3 tuition-free graduate credits upon successful completion of each DataStreme course and construction of a Plan of Action for educational peer-training.\nDataStreme ECS investigates the fundamental science of Earth’s climate system, explores humans’ impact on it, and identifies actions needed in response to climate change. The course provides participants with the knowledge to make informed climate decisions. In fact, according to a recent three-year study conducted by AMS, 98% of DataStreme ECS participants reported an increase in environmental literacy as a result of the course.\nDataStreme Atmosphere, Ocean, and ECS content has been improved because of AMS partnerships with NOAA and NASA. Specifically, hundreds of NASA and NOAA scientists and faculty from numerous institutions both domestic and abroad have contributed and reviewed DataStreme ECS content. Additional collaborations with Consortium for Ocean Leadership and the U.S. Ice Drilling Program greatly improved the course’s paleoclimate content. Looking ahead, the Climate Resilience Toolkit from NOAA’s Climate Program Office will further bolster the course this fall. These partnerships have resulted in a powerful, content-rich climate science course for K-12 teachers, building the foundation to a climate literate society.",

Along this route, which lies very near the GPCI (GCSS Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison) transect, the predominant cloud regime changes from stratocumulus near the California coast to trade-wind cumulus near Hawaii. The transition between these two regimes is poorly understood and not accurately represented in models. The goal of MAGIC was to acquire statistic of this transition and thus improve its representation in models by making repeated transects through this region and measuring properties of clouds and precipitation, aerosols, radiation, and atmospheric structure. To achieve these goals, the Second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2) was deployed on the Horizon Spirit as it ran its regular route between Los Angeles and Honolulu. AMF2 consists of three 20-foot SeaTainers and includes three radars and other instruments to measure properties of clouds and precipitation; the Aerosol Observing System (AOS), which has a suite of instruments to measure properties of aerosols; and other instruments to measure radiation, meteorological quantities, and sea surface temperature. Two technicians accompanied the AMF2, and scientists rode the ship as observers. MAGIC made nearly 20 round trips between Los Angeles and Honolulu (and thus nearly 40 excursions through the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition) and spent 200 days at sea, collecting an unprecedented data set. Aerosol properties measured with the AOS include number concentration and size distribution, CCN activity, hygroscopic growth, and light-scattering and absorption. Additionally, more than one hundred filter samples were collected. Aerosol properties and their spatial and temporal behavior are discussed and examined in terms of other meteorological and environmental parameters.",

            "abstract": "Natural watersheds are hierarchical networks that may confer stability to ecosystem functions through integration of upstream biodiversity, whereby upstream asset diversification stabilizes the aggregate downstream through the portfolio effect. Here we show that riverine structure and its associated diversity confer stability of salmon catch and lengthened fishing seasons for Aboriginal fisheries on the Fraser River (1370km) in BC, Canada, the second longest dam-free salmon migration route in North America. In Canada, Aboriginal people have rights to fish for food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) purposes. FSC fisheries are located throughout the Fraser watershed and have access to varying levels of salmon diversity based on their location. For instance, fisheries at the mouth of the river have access to all of the salmon that spawn throughout the entire watershed, thus integrating across the complete diversity profile of the entire river. In contrast, fisheries in the headwaters have access to fewer salmon species and populations and thus fish from a much less diverse portfolio. These spatial gradients of diversity within watersheds provide a natural contrast for quantifying the effects of different types of diversity on interannual resource stability and seasonal availability.\nWe acquired weekly and yearly catch totals from 1983 to 2012 (30 years) for Chinook, chum, coho, pink, and sockeye salmon for 21 FSC fishing sites throughout the Fraser River watershed from Fisheries and Oceans Canada. We examined how both population- and species-level diversity affects catch stability and season length at each site by quantifying year-to-year variability and within-year season length respectively. Salmon species diversity made fisheries up to 28% more stable in their catch than predicted with 3.7 more weeks to fish on average. Fisheries with access to high population diversity had up to 3.8 times more stable catch and 3 times longer seasons than less diverse fisheries. We show that both species- and population-level diversity support food security in First Nations fisheries. These data indicate that protecting multiple dimensions of biodiversity, such as through preserving the natural structure of watersheds, will promote food security of Aboriginal people.",

            "abstract": "One possible reason for methane venting from the Arctic shelf could be destabilization of intra-permafrost hydrates due to inundation of permafrost by seawater a few thousand years ago. Formation of intra-permafrost hydrates presumably takes place when regression of the sea exposes a shelf above sea level; subsequently the sediments cool and freeze. Ice crystals growing within the pore and/or inter-pore space create high pressure; together with low temperatures (down to -22°C), this produces very specific temperature-pressure (T/P) conditions that allow the existence of hydrates at any depth below the seafloor/ground surface where such T/P conditions develop. An additional factor stabilizing this type of hydrate is the so-called self-preservation phenomenon; due to this phenomenon, it has been suggested that hydrates can remain stable during inter-glacial cycles (so-called metastable or relic hydrates). However, destabilization of intra-permafrost hydrates might occur due to significant change in the permafrost thermal regime as well as to salt penetration down the sediment core. To assess the stability of intra-permafrost hydrates, we examined sediment cores drilled from the sea ice in the near-shore zone of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) (Laptev Sea, Buor-Khaya Bay). There is a critical negative (below 0°C) temperature under which relic hydrates start to dissociate, causing volumetric expansion of dissociation-generated free gas. Experimental data revealed that salt penetration into frozen hydrate-containing sediments could affect the stability of intra-permafrost hydrates before heat propagation causes thawing of permafrost. Intrusion of salt ions can cause active dissociation of intra-permafrost hydrates and consequent releases of methane even from frozen hydrate-bearing sediments/ground. These findings are important in connection with methane releases observed in the ESAS underlain with subsea permafrost, which is experiencing change in its thermal regime due to inundation by seawater.",

Yet, we lack a method to continuously monitor plant water content, particularly on small plants. We developed a method to continuously monitor tree and shrub water content using time domain reflectometry (TDR), a measurement technique commonly used to assess soil moisture. TDR probes were fabricated and inserted into trees and shrubs. Automated measurements were made at 30 minute intervals over several months. Calibration was performed by drying cut sections of trees and shrubs in the lab while making paired TDR and weight measurements on those samples to calculate gravimetric water content. Gravimetric water content was converted to volumetric water content to create a calibration equations relating TDR measurements to water content in Betula neoalaskana, Picea mariana, Populus tremuloides, and Salix alaxensis. Our fabricated TDR probes and our calibration equations permit continuous, non-destructive, and accurate measurements of stem water content in live trees and shrubs. These data show diurnal and seasonal patterns of water content which can be incorporated into plant physiological and hydrological models. ",

            "abstract": "Accurate determinations of the mean radii of Pluto and Charon are important for establishing their densities and thus bulk composition. A fossil bulge, if present, would place constraints on the thermal and orbital evolution of these bodies [1,2]. The New Horizons LORRI imaging system [3] has provided global images of Pluto and Charon, with best resolutions of 3.8 and 2.3 km/pix, respectively. Three separate approaches have been used to determine mean radii and shape from the images, two using a threshold DN value [4,5] and one using a maximum gradient method. These approaches were validated using synthetic images having a range of photometric functions. Tradeoffs between the limb center location and the derived shape in individual images can be reduced by combining limb picks from different images. Preliminary results for both Pluto and Charon will be presented.\n[1] Robuchon & Nimmo, Icarus 216, 426, 2011. [2] McKinnon & Singer, DPS 46, abs. no. 419.07, 2014.

            "abstract": "In an era of discord in public views of climate change, communicating atmospheric and related sciences to the public at a large research facility like the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) can be a daunting challenge yet one that is filled with many possibilities. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Center for Science Education (SciEd) is responsible for education and outreach activities at UCAR, including the exhibits program. Over 90,000 people visit the NCAR Mesa Lab each year to enjoy a number of exhibits that showcase our community’s research.\nThe current climate exhibit is twelve years old, and with advances in our understanding of climate science and exhibit design, SciEd staff are developing a new exhibit that is as cutting edge as the research conducted at NCAR. Based on listening sessions with NCAR scientists, the following big ideas for the exhibit emerged:\nHow the climate system works\nThe climate system is changing\nHow scientists study our climate\nRegional impacts\nSolutions\nThe goal of the new climate exhibit is to reach people using a variety of learning styles, including offerings for visitors who learn by doing, as well as providing informative text and images (Hatheway, 2014).\nDevelopers and evaluators are working together to conduct front-end, formative, and summative evaluations to understand of the needs of our visitors and collect ongoing data to inform development. The purpose of the front-end evaluation, conducted in the summer of 2014 was to develop informed data-driven strategies to move forward with exhibit design. The evaluation results to be shared in this session include:\nThe demographics and behaviors of visitors\nTrends in visitors’ experiences\nVisitor input on exhibit design (Williams and Tarsi, 2014).\nIn this presentation, we will share the results, significance, and application of the front-end evaluation as part of a comprehensive approach to study both how we convey information about climate science and plan for the re-design of a new climate exhibit.",

One of the primary goals of these applications is to provide a consistent experience for accessing both near-real time information as soon as it is available and historic information after it is thoroughly reviewed. Millions of people use these applications every month including people who feel an earthquake, emergency responders looking for the latest information about a recent event, and scientists researching historic earthquakes and their effects.\nInformation from multiple catalogs and contributors is combined by the ANSS Comprehensive Catalog into one composite catalog, identifying the most preferred information from any source for each event. A web service and near-real time feeds provide access to all contributed data, and are used by a number of users and software packages. The Latest Earthquakes application displays summaries of many events, either near-real time feeds or custom searches, and the Event Page application shows detailed information for each event. Because all data is accessed through the web service, it can also be downloaded by users.\nThe applications are maintained as open source projects on github, and use mobile-first and responsive-web-design approaches to work well on both mobile devices and desktop computers.\nhttp://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/",

            "abstract": "Shrubs are increasing in abundance in the Arctic in response to climate warming, but the consequences of shrub expansion for the vast soil carbon (C) stocks in the Arctic are poorly understood. Increases in productivity and associated increases in soil C inputs may augment soil C stocks. Alternatively, labile C exudates from shrub roots may stimulate decomposition of existing soil C and decrease C stocks. We used two complementary approaches to characterize the potential impacts of shrub expansion on soil C dynamics in the Arctic.\nFirst, in graminoid and shrub tundra near Toolik Lake, AK we surveyed thaw depth, measured depth profiles of %C, %N, δ13C, and Δ14C, and inventoried soil C stocks to 1 m. We found that the thaw depth was 42% shallower under shrubs compared to graminoid tundra. In addition, mineral soils from shrub tundra had a significantly higher C content than graminoid tundra. Similarly, mineral soils from shrub tundra had lower (depleted) δ13C values compared to graminoid tundra, indicating that this soil has undergone less microbial processing. We also found that C under shrub tundra was on average older, and shrub tundra had significantly higher C stocks to 1 m than graminoid tundra.\nSecond, we conducted a priming experiment with graminoid soil from Toolik Lake, AK. We incubated organic soil, the top 10 cm of mineral soil, and the lower 10 cm of active layer mineral soil with supplemental sucrose at 7°C and 22°C. We found that the addition of labile C did not increase microbial decomposition of existing C in mineral soils.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that shrub expansion may augment soil C storage in the Arctic because a greater proportion of soil C is frozen in permafrost, soil C under shrubs turns over more slowly, and existing C in mineral soil does not appear to be vulnerable to loss via priming. The observed impacts of shrub expansion on soil C stocks should be incorporated into earth system models that predict the carbon-climate feedback of the Arctic.",

We present modeling results of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of locally born interstellar pickup ions at the solar wind termination shock by solving the standard focused transport equation numerically. Local time variations in the Parker spiral magnetic field angle are modeled using a q-Gaussian statistical description. The main results are: (1) The injection and DSA of pickup ions depends on the shape and width of the q-Gaussian distribution of the Parker spiral magnetic field angle. (2) Likewise, the accelerated pickup ion pitch-angle distribution also depends on the q-Gaussian distribution of the magnetic field angle. (3) The simulated accelerated pickup ion spectrum is much quieter far downstream than just behind the termination shock as observations show. (4) Magnetic reflection of accelerated pickup ions by the cross-shock magnetic field gradient results in the sporadic formation of highly anisotropic, energy-dependent intensity spikes in the accelerated pickup proton distribution at the termination shock.",

            "abstract": "The bioenergy crops, Corn, Miscanthus and switchgrass have a potential to meet future energy demands in the US and mitigate climate change by partially replacing fossil fuels. However, the large-scale cultivation of these bioenergy crops may also impact climate change through changes in albedo, evapotranspiration (ET), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Whether these climate effects will mitigate or exacerbate climate change in the short and long terms is uncertain. The uncertainties come from our incomplete understanding of the effects of expanded bioenergy crop production on terrestrial water and energy balance, carbon and nitrogen dynamics, and their interactions. This study aims to understand the implications of growing large scale bioenergy crops on water resources, carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the United States using a data- modeling framework (ISAM) that we developed. Our study indicates that both Miscanthus and Cave-in-Rock switchgrass can attain high and stable yield over parts of the Midwest, however, this high production is attained at the cost of increased soil water loss as compared to current natural vegetation. Alamo switchgrass can attain high and stable yield in the southern US without significant influence on soil water quantity. ",

            "abstract": "Millions of people rely on groundwater as a key, provisioning ecosystem service (ES). Our previous data suggested that drinking water nitrate concentrations and exurban development have significantly increased in the last three decades in Pocatello, Idaho, USA. Increased nitrate can lead to changes in ES and human values (such as water quality, people’s knowledge, and housing values). We predicted people who tested their water quality would be aware of nitrate contamination and its potential to affect their housing prices, and they would choose to invest in home drinking water treatment systems. To test these hypotheses, we measured nitrate concentrations in hundreds of drinking water wells in years 1985, 1994, 2004, and 2015. We conducted a randomized public survey to determine the degrees to which: (1) people tested their private well water for nitrate and (2) were concerned about health issues related to contamination; (3) how important water quality is for determining local property values; and (4) if people treat their drinking water. We then developed a biophysical model to understand how exurban growth, local geology, and time influenced groundwater nitrate. Finally, we applied an economic, hedonic model to determine if groundwater nitrate concentrations negatively correlated to property values. Aquifer boundaries, slope, rock and soil type were significant predictors of nitrate (ordinary least squares, α <0.05). The hedonic model suggested that although nitrate and local housing values were spatially heterogeneous and increasing through time, exurban growth and nitrate alone were not strong predictors of water quality or property values. We also present an integrated biophysical, economic, and social model to better understand people’s perceptions and behaviors of local nitrate pollution. Interdisciplinary ES and valuation may require multiple data types and integrated models to understand how ES and human values are influenced by exurban growth.",

            "abstract": "Ozone (O3) trends analysis is typically performed with monthly or seasonal averages. Although this approach works well for stratospheric or total O3, uncertainties in tropospheric O3 amounts may be large due to rapid meteorological changes near the tropopause and in the lower free troposphere (LFT) where pollution has a days-weeks lifetime. We use self-organizing maps (SOM), a clustering technique, as an alternative for creating tropospheric climatologies from O3 soundings. In a previous study of 900 tropical ozonesondes, clusters representing >40% of profiles deviated > 1-sigma from mean O­3. Here SOM are based on 15 years of data from four sites in the contiguous US (CONUS; Boulder, CO; Huntsville, AL; Trinidad Head, CA; Wallops Island, VA). Ozone profiles from 2 – 12 km are used to evaluate the impact of tropopause variability on climatology; 2 – 6 km O3 profile segments are used for the LFT. Near-tropopause O­3 is twice the mean O­3 mixing ratio in three clusters of 2 – 12 km O3, representing > 15% of profiles at each site. Large mid and lower-tropospheric O3 deviations from monthly means are found in clusters of both 2 – 12 and 2 – 6 km O3. Positive offsets result from pollution and stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange. In the LFT the lowest tropospheric O3 is associated with subtropical air. Some clusters include profiles with common seasonality but other factors, e.g., tropopause height or LFT column amount, characterize other SOM nodes. Thus, as for tropical profiles, CONUS O­3 averages can be a poor choice for a climatology.",

            "abstract": "Stratigraphic alignment is the primary way in which long marine climate records are placed on a common age model. We previously presented a probabilistic pairwise alignment algorithm, HMM-Match, which uses hidden Markov models to estimate alignment uncertainty and apply it to the alignment of benthic δ18O records to the “LR04” global benthic stack of Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) (Lin et al., 2014). However, since the LR04 stack is deterministic, the algorithm does not account for uncertainty in the stack. Here we address this limitation by developing a probabilistic stack, HMM-Stack. In this model the stack is a probabilistic inhomogeneous hidden Markov model, a.k.a. profile HMM. The HMM-stack is represented by a probabilistic model that “emits” each of the input records (Durbin et al., 1998). The unknown parameters of this model are learned from a set of input records using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Because the multiple alignment of these records is unknown and uncertain, the expected contribution of each input point to each point in the stack is determined probabilistically. For each time step in the HMM-stack, δ18O values are described by a Gaussian probability distribution. Available δ18O records (N=180) are employed to estimate the mean and variance of δ18O at each time point. The mean of HMM-Stack follows the predicted pattern of glacial cycles with increased amplitude after the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary and also larger and longer cycles after the mid-Pleistocene transition. Furthermore, the δ18O variance increases with age, producing a substantial loss in the signal-to-noise ratio. Not surprisingly, uncertainty in alignment and thus estimated age also increase substantially in the older portion of the stack.",

            "abstract": "The Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations (MATERHORN) program collected a high-resolution observational dataset to test and improve mesoscale model performance and weather prediction in complex terrain. One of the focal points of the MATERHORN field program was a relatively uniform mountain slope where large nocturnal temperature variations due to the displacement of a valley cold air pool (CAP) up the slope have been observed. CAP displacements can significantly impact the near-surface temperature and wind but are poorly represented in mesoscale models. This work aims to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of CAP displacements and the mechanisms causing them.\nCAP displacements are identified using data from a transect of 4 automatic weather stations (AWS) and 5 flux towers deployed on the east slope of Granite Peak (GP) in Northwest Utah. The instrument transect spans 130 m of elevation starting on the valley floor and rising up the uniform alluvial fan at the base of GP. 116 additional AWS’s in the vicinity of GP are used to diagnose the mechanisms causing the displacements. The dense grid of observations allows the tracking of coherent features in the pressure, temperature, and wind fields as they interact with the CAP and the topography of GP. Two time periods, October 2012 and May 2013, were investigated for the presence of CAP displacements and their causes.\nIn October, a typical night exhibits an average of 5 cold-pool displacement events that are evenly distributed between 2100 and 0500 MST when valley CAPs have developed. In May, fewer displacement events are observed (3 per night) and they occur preferentially later in the night, between 0000 and 0400 MST. Displacements are frequently associated with features that can be tracked across the plain surrounding GP. These features include slope and valley flow “fronts” descending the surrounding terrain, seiching, and mesoscale boundaries. In addition to describing the spatial and temporal distribution of CAP displacements, two case study periods will be used to illustrate the spatial and temporal evolution of CAP displacements forced by two different forcing mechanisms, slope and valley flow “fronts” and mesoscale boundaries.",

However, our current knowledge of this period remains very limited. We analyzed 19 diabase dikes from the Baraga-Marquette swarm (Michigan, USA) which intruded during the formation of the ~1.1 Ga North American Mid-Continent Rift (MCR) system. Both normal and reversed polarity dikes contain stable primary magnetization carried predominantly by single to pseudo-single domain magnetite and/or low-Ti titanomagnetite. We will present new paleointensity determinations retrieved from the dikes using several paleointensity techniques (e.g. LTD- Thellier, LTD-Shaw) and discuss their implications for the geodynamo evolution at the time of the MCR formation.",

            "abstract": "Following the release of version 2 of the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, we present an overview of the quality of ozone in the new reanalysis. As one of the focal aspects of MERRA-2, the assimilation of ozone data constitutes a significant improvement over the predecessor reanalysis, MERRA. The observations used consist of retrieved partial columns from the Solar Backscattered UV Radiometers (SBUV) and data from two instruments onboard NASA’s Aura satellite: the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI, total ozone column) and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS, stratospheric profiles). In this presentation we will show results of an evaluation of stratospheric and upper tropospheric MERRA-2 ozone fields against independent data. Validation of upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric fields is done using observations from ozonesondes and focuses on the realism of ozone gradients across the tropopause and the representation of highly dynamical vertical structures in the lower stratosphere. The stratospheric profiles are evaluated against observations from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) MLS, the ENVISAT MIPAS and SAGE II instruments. Vertically integrated fields will be compared with observations from SBUV and the long record of observations made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). Furthermore, we will compare our results to those from other reanalyses including MERRA and discuss the implications of changes in the observing system for trend studies. We will highlight potential applications of the reanalysis ozone for scientific research of transport processes and radiative forcing by ozone.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s inner core (329~364 GPa and 5000~6000 K) is thought to be composed of hexagonal closed pack (hcp) structured solid Fe-Ni alloy (e.g., Mao et al., 1998; Kuwayama et al., 2008; Sha & Cohen, 2010). Thermoelasticity of hcp (ε) iron is therefore a key to interpreting seismological information of the inner core: density, seismic wave velocities, and their anisotropy. However, several studies reported that hcp iron has a shear modulus distinctly larger than that of the inner core (e.g., Mao et al., 1998; Vocadlo et al., 2009). This large Poisson ratio of the inner core is one of the remaining inexplicable features of the deep Earth, and it suggests the presence of mechanisms to lower the S-wave velocity in the inner core, such as a low-velocity component (Prescher et al., 2015), pre-melting effect (Martorell et al., 2013), anelasticity, and so on.\nIn this study, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations employing a supercell larger than in previous calculations (Vocadlo et al., 2009; Martorell et al., 2013). Also computations are conducted in a wide P,T range including, but not limited to, the inner core conditions to clarify the P,T effects on the elasticity of the hcp iron more comprehensively, and to provide an internally-consistent thermoelastic model. In addition to checking the validity of the Birch’s law, the obtained Poisson ratio and aggregate anisotropy, with and without the pre-melting effect, are compared against seismological constraints to reinvestigate the viability of hcp iron in the inner core.\nResearch supported by KAKENHI (JSPS) and the X-ray Free Electron Laser Priority Strategy Program (MEXT).",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is a hotspot for biogeochemical processing that can attenuate a variety of nonpoint source contaminants in streamwater. However, hyporheic zones in urban and agricultural streams are often degraded and poorly connected with surface water. In order to increase hyporheic exchange and improve water quality, we introduced engineered streambeds as a stormwater and restoration best management practice. Modifications to streambed hydraulic conductivity and reactivity are termed Biohydrochemical Enhancement structures for Streamwater Treatment (BEST). BEST are subsurface modules that utilize low- and high-permeability sediments to drive efficient hyporheic exchange, and reactive geomedia to increase reaction rates within the hyporheic zone. This work presents the first physical performance data of BEST modules at the pilot scale. BEST modules were installed in a constructed stream facility at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO. This facility features two 15m artificial streams, which included an all sand control condition alongside the BEST test condition. Streams were continuously operated at a discharge of 1 L/s using recycled water. Time-lapse electrical resistivity surveys demonstrated that BEST modules provided substantially greater hyporheic exchange than the control condition. Water quality samples at the hyporheic and reach scales also revealed greater attenuation of nitrogen, coliforms, and select metals and trace organics by BEST modules relative to the control condition. These experimental results were also compared to previous numerical model simulations to evaluate model accuracy. Together, these results show that BEST may be an effective best management practice for improving streamwater quality in urban and agricultural settings.",

            "abstract": "The effectiveness of in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) to remediate contaminated aquifers is constrained by the amount of contact between the groundwater contaminant and the injected oxidant. Contaminant degradation during ISCO can be enhanced using innovative active spreading strategies, which involve injecting and extracting water at wells in the vicinity of the plume to generate flow fields that spread the contaminant and oxidant plumes in a manner that increases their contact. Because aquifer heterogeneity affects the transport of the contaminant and oxidant during injection and extraction, aquifer heterogeneity also affects the amount of contact and the degree of contaminant degradation achieved using active spreading strategies during ISCO. Consequently, we can improve the effectiveness of active spreading strategies by generating sequences of injection and extraction that take the aquifer heterogeneity into account. In this study, we optimize sequences of injections and extractions to maximize contaminant degradation in aquifers with zonal and spatially-correlated heterogeneity for three contaminant-oxidant pairings with different reaction kinetics. Analysis of the transport and degradation corresponding to the optimal sequences of injection and extraction demonstrates that the underlying aquifer and contaminant properties are reflected by the optimal sequences.",

            "abstract": "The physical properties of silicate melts within the Earth’s mantle affect the chemical and thermal evolution of the Earth’s interior. The behavior of iron in mantle melts is poorly understood, but can be experimentally approximated by iron-bearing silicate glasses. Previous studies have conflicting conclusions on whether iron in lower mantle silicate melts goes through a high-spin to low-spin transition [1-3]. Additionally, the average coordination environment of iron in glasses is poorly constrained. XANES experiments on MORB glasses have demonstrated that both four and six-fold coordinated iron may exist in significant amounts regardless of oxidation state [4] while conventional Mossbauer experiments have observed five-fold coordinated Fe2+ with small amounts of four and six-fold coordinated Fe2+[5].\nIn an attempt to resolve these discrepancies, we have measured the hyperfine parameters of iron-bearing rhyolitic glass up to ~115 GPa in a neon pressure medium using time-resolved synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, IL). Our spectra are well explained with a three-doublet model: two high-spin Fe2+-like sites with distinct quadrupole splittings and similar isomer shifts and one high-spin Fe3+-like site. Our results indicate that iron experiences changes in coordination with increasing pressure without undergoing a high-spin to low-spin transition. With the assumption that silicate glasses can be used to model structural behavior in silicate melts, our study predicts that iron in chemically–complex silica-rich melts in the lower mantle likely exists in a high-spin state.\n",

            "abstract": "The prediction of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall at intraseasonal time scale is investigated in this study. The summer monsoon exhibits intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) with different periods. The leading ISO, with a period of 45 days, is presumably related to the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The ISOs have large-scale spatial structure and propagate northeastward and northwestward. A prediction model, based on some basic results of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, is constructed to predict the monsoon rainfall. An equivalent phase space of reduced dimension can be reconstructed from a long time-series of a single or a few variables of the dynamical system. In such a phase space, the trajectory of the dynamical system can be examined to search for nearest neighbors. An ensemble of such nearest neighbors and their subsequent evolution are used to construct the prediction model. In some respects, this method is similar to Lorenz’s analog method. The reduced phase space is reconstructed by using a limited number of eigenmodes obtained from multi-channel singular spectrum analysis of the rainfall over the monsoon region. For this purpose, the daily gridded rainfall over India for the period 1901-2010 is used. These eigenmodes represent the ISOs and seasonally persistent modes. The prediction of the monsoon rainfall by this model is compared with the retrospective forecasts made by NCEP CFSv2 and other S2S models.",

The same five elements constitute the human body. The Chinese and many other native traditions have used their deep understanding of these elements to live in balance with the planet. David Suzuki has elaborated on this key issue in his classic book, The Legacy: “Today we are in a state of crisis, and we must join together to respond to that crisis. If we do so, Suzuki envisions a future in which we understand that we are the Earth and live accordingly. All it takes is imagination and a determination to live within our, and the planet's, means”. Gravity, the common force that connects both the body and earth plays a major role in the metabolism as well as the autonomous function of different organs in the body. Gravity has a direct influence on the fruits and vegetables that are grown on the planet as well. As a result, there is a direct relationship among gravity, food and human health.\nMy talk will cover the missing link between the Earth’s Gravity and the human health. A new set of ancient axioms will be used to address this and many other issues that are remain as “major unsolved problems” linking modern Geophysical and Health sciences.",

Pockmark occurrence appears to be bathymetrically controlled with a band of smaller pockmarks covering areas between 500 and 700 m and large seafloor depressions beneath 800 m water depth. The current depth of the top of methane gas hydrate stability in the ocean is about 500 m and thus, we had proposed that pockmark formation may be linked to methane gas hydrate dissociation during sealevel lowering. However, while seismic profiles show strong indications of fluid flow, geochemical analyses of piston cores do not show any evidence for current or past methane flux.\nThe discovery of Dawsonite, indicative of significant CO2 flux, in a recent petroleum exploration well, together with other circumstantial evidence, has led us to propose that instead of methane hydrate, CO2 hydrate may be linked to pockmark formation. We here present results from CO2 hydrate stability calculations. Assuming water temperature profiles remain unchanged, we predict the upper limit of pockmark occurrence to coincide with the top of CO2 gas hydrate stability during glacial-stage sealevel lowstands. CO2 hydrates may therefore have dissociated during sealevel lowering leading to gas escape and pockmark formation. In contrast to our previous model linking methane hydrate dissociation to pockmark formation, gas hydrates would dissociate beneath a shallow base of CO2 hydrate stability, rather than on the seafloor following upward “grazing” of the top of methane hydrate stability.\nIntriguingly, at the water depths of the larger seafloor depressions, the base of gas hydrate stability delineates the phase boundary between CO2 hydrates and super-saturated CO2. We caution that because of the high solubility of CO2, dissociation from hydrate to free gas or super-saturated CO2 would imply high concentrations of CO2 and speculate that pockmark formation may be linked to CO2 hydrate dissolution rather than dissociation. While still speculative, CO2 flux and resulting CO2 hydrate formation would be compatible with many of the geophysical and geochemical anomalies observed on the Chatham Rise and adjacent Canterbury Basin.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution tomographic models are essential for understanding the physical and compositional properties in the lithosphere and obtaining accurate earthquake source locations and moment tensors. Yet, there are significant disagreements in recent three-dimensional velocity models of the crust and uppermost mantle in Tibet. Question also remains as to whether models constructed from one type of seismic waves (body or surface waves) can be used to predict travel times and waveforms of another. In this study, six global or regional models are selected for Tibet, most of which became publically available in the past five years. A three-dimensional finite-difference method in the spherical coordinates is applied to simulate full-wave propagation of regional Pn (with periods longer than 1 second) and Rayleigh waves (20-75 s period) for ground-truth events located at regional distances. The models are evaluated based on the phase delays and cross-correlation coefficients between synthetic and observed waveforms.\nA model generated from full-wave ambient noise tomography by Shen and Zhang (2012) consistently produces the best predictions for Rayleigh waves throughout the dataset and the Pn waves for the paths from the Tarim Basin to central Tibet. LITHO1.0, inverted from surface wave dispersions, shows a relatively stable but intermediate performance in predicting Pn and Rayleigh waves. None of the models provide the best matches to both waves throughout the region. Furthermore, the models constructed from surface waves are not well suited to predict Pn, and vice versa. We attribute this mainly to lack of accurate constraints on radial anisotropy and Vp/Vs ratios in the upper mantle, and Moho topography. We conclude that simultaneous prediction for P, S, and surface waves requires an integrated velocity model constructed with multiple seismic waveforms and consideration of other important properties, such as anisotropy and attenuation.",

The California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS) on the top of Mt Wilson, California, offers continuous high-resolution spectral measurements from 4000 to 8000 cm-1. We retrieve H2O slant column densities (SCDs) at different wavelengths using CLARS data. In particular, we compare retrievals from the spectralon, which is above the planetary boundary layer and relatively immune to aerosol scattering, with those from West Pasadena, a location in the Los Angeles basin that is influenced by aerosol scattering. SCD retrievals for West Pasadena show significantly larger variance across different wavelengths. The retrieval error in West Pasadena is much larger than can be attributed to spectroscopic uncertainties, and reflects the wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering.\nUsing a two-stream enhanced single scattering (2S-ESS) radiative transfer (RT) model, we simulated the effect of aerosol scattering on H2O SCD retrievals at different wavelengths. We found the effects are sensitive to the surface albedo, aerosol phase function and single scattering albedo. Using an empirical relationship derived from the radiative transfer model simulations, we relate the H2O retrieval variance to the aerosol optical depth Angstrom coefficient and compare the results with AERONET observations. The additional information gained from H2O retrieval variance within a large range of wavelengths could be used to improve OCO-2 type CO2 retrievals in the presence of aerosols.",

They develop long-standing relationships with research partners, including national laboratories and state geological surveys, whose work may support policy development and analysis at local, state, regional, and national levels. CSM’s Payne Institute for Earth Resources awards mini-grants for teams of researchers to develop collaborative research efforts between engineering/science and policy researchers. Current work in the areas of nuclear generation and the costs of climate policy and on policy alternatives for capturing fugitive methane emissions are examples of work at the interface between the geosciences and public policy.\n With academic engagement, geoscientists can steward their intellectual output when non-scientists translate geoscience information and concepts into action through public policies.",

            "abstract": "Gulf of California (GoC) moisture surges are transient disturbances that propagate northwards along the Gulf of California during the July-September North American Monsoon (NAM) season. They are typically associated with positive intense northward winds along the GoC and positive precipitation anomalies in the NAM region, with widespread thunderstorms over the Southwestern USA. Their frequency and strength therefore have an important impact on the rainfall summer budget of this area. Previous studies have suggested that the strength of GoC surges depends on large-scale dynamical controls, such as tropical easterly waves (TEWs) transiting over the tropical eastern Pacific ocean, and upper-level midlatitude westerly disturbances (WDs) transiting over Northern America. Here, we perform an EOF analysis of the GoC alongshore wind from reanalysis products to investigate the intra-seasonal variability of GoC surges and its relationship with precipitation anomalies. The first and second principal components, which explain more that 80% of the summertime variability of GoC winds, provide very effective indeces of strong and weak surges, with the former being associated with coherent wind anomalies throughout the GoC and the latter with anomalies primarily confined over its northern half. Lagged linear regressions analyses are used to identify synoptic patterns associated with the development of GoC surges. We identify three modes that modulate GoC surge events on different time scales: 1) fast TEWs and WDs (2-8 days); 2) tropical quasi-biweekly easterly disturbances and quasi-stationary midlatitude Rossby waves (10-20 days) and 3) Madden-Julian oscillation rainfall rearrangements along the ITCZ. The 10-20-day mode is found to be the major control on precipitation anomalies associated with GoC surge events. While not negligible, the synoptic mode (2-8 days) plays a lesser role.",

Water adsorption or diffusion depends on particle viscosity in semi-solid to liquid states. This relationship between particle viscosity as a function of RH and the corresponding hygroscopic behavioral response is the purpose of this study. However, reliable techniques for viscosity quantification have been limited.\nA Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) was used for viscosity measurements and to determine phase changes. Prior to studies on field samples, microscope immersion/viscosity standard oils, salt crystals, sugars and alpha-pinene secondary organic aerosol (SOA) surrogates are used for viscosity, RH calibrations, water uptake and phase change measurements. RH was controlled by flowing N2 gas saturated with H2O for RH’s between 0-75% RH. For higher RH values, (75-100% RH range) saturated salt solutions were flowed over a gore membrane to protect the QCM sensor from direct contact with the solutions. The viscosity calibration constructed via QTools fitting software illustrates the limitations as well as the ranges of reliability of the QCM viscosity measurements. Deliquescing salt crystals of differing deliquescence relative humidity’s (DRH), sugars and alpha-pinene SOA’s provided insight into the detection of various phase change behaviors. Water uptake experiments performed on alpha-pinene SOA and sucrose sugar yielded significantly different frequency and dissipation responses than the deliquescing salts.\nFuture work will apply these experimental methods and analysis on aerosol particles collected during the GoAmazon field campaign.",

            "abstract": "An academic mentoring relationship can develop organically from joint experiences as a student-teacher team involved in undergraduate research projects. The mentor rarely has been trained for this role, and the mentee may not have actively searched for a mentor at first. Once the relationship is recognized the mentor may struggle with conflicting roles, aspects of fairness to other students, recognizing what is best for the mentee (and allowing them to figure something out on their own rather than imposing a viewpoint), and questioning the value of advice because of differences in age, culture, and own career path. The mentee does not want to disappoint, can feel ashamed to ask questions (sometimes more than once), may not want to share their own opinion - let alone challenge their mentor! - and may also be afraid that they rely to much on their mentor rather than searching for answers on their own. Both parties thus face similar challenges but from different perspectives. In our opinion a good mentoring relationship is built on honesty and respect as well as mutual trust where we can point out strengths or weaknesses in one another and recognize our vulnerabilities. Our conversations have touched on many aspects of our lives (including academic, home, soft skills, and personal development). We have asked questions neither of us could answer at first but which challenged each other for further learning. Our experience has resulted in a two-way support, revealed new points of view, and allowed for development of leadership skills for both. In this presentation we will report on our journey so far, assumptions we brought along, expectations we shared, and challenges we have faced individually or together. By sharing the perceptions of both parties in our unique mentorship relationship we want to help define best mentoring practices.",

            "abstract": "The ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system for the west coast of the United States is designed to combine information from multiple independent earthquake analysis algorithms in order to provide the public with robust predictions of shaking intensity at each user’s location before they are affected by strong shaking. The current contributing analyses come from algorithms that determine the origin time, epicenter, and magnitude of an earthquake (On-site, ElarmS, and Virtual Seismologist). A second generation of algorithms will provide seismic line source information (FinDer), as well as geodetically-constrained slip models (BEFORES, GPSlip, G-larmS, G-FAST). These new algorithms will provide more information about the spatial extent of the earthquake rupture and thus improve the quality of the resulting shaking forecasts.\n\nEach of the contributing algorithms exploits different features of the observed seismic and geodetic data, and thus each algorithm may perform differently for different data availability and earthquake source characteristics. Thus the ShakeAlert system requires a central mediator, called the Central Decision Module (CDM). The CDM acts to combine disparate earthquake source information into one unified shaking forecast. Here we will present a new design for the CDM that uses a Bayesian framework to combine earthquake reports from multiple analysis algorithms and compares them to observed shaking information in order to both assess the relative plausibility of each earthquake report and to create an improved unified shaking forecast complete with appropriate uncertainties. We will describe how these probabilistic shaking forecasts can be used to provide each user with a personalized decision-making tool that can help decide whether or not to take a protective action (such as opening fire house doors or stopping trains) based on that user’s distance to the earthquake, vulnerability to shaking, false alarm tolerance, and time required to act.",

Further, do extreme magnitudes of El Niño and La Niña events exert a unique and particularly strong controlling effect on weather extremes? Here, we utilize both observations and multi-model large ensemble historical simulations to characterize the behavior of 5-day maximum precipitation distributions. We focus on relations between ENSO impacts on seasonal means and weather extremes, and explore the distinction between effects based on ENSO phase and intensity.\nFor the cold season (November to April), overall ENSO impacts on mean precipitation are shown to be consistent with observations. This signal includes enhanced seasonal mean precipitation over the southern part of the U.S. and central Great Plains during El Niño, and enhanced seasonal mean precipitation over the Midwest during La Nina. We further demonstrate how these signals change under the influence of the most extreme ENSO events, conditions that are difficult to verify from observations owing to small sample sizes, but are modeled via large ensemble methods. The statistics of 5-day maximum precipitation, with a focus on 20-year return levels that characterizes rare but potentially damaging events, are examined. We demonstrate substantial differences in changes in the risk of extreme 5-day precipitation and the seasonal mean precipitation signal, especially in such regions as California, and the western Great Plains including the Front Range of the Rockies from Montana to New Mexico. The plausibility of such behavior is discussed via physical considerations and by examining the structural uncertainty in such outcomes across three different climate models.",

Current understanding of the factors controlling biogenic isoprene emissions and of the fate of isoprene oxidation products in the atmosphere has been evolving rapidly. We use a climate-biosphere-chemistry modeling framework to evaluate the sensitivity of estimates of the tropospheric oxidative capacity to uncertainties in isoprene emissions and photochemistry. Our work focuses on trends across two time horizons: from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19,000-23,000 years BP) to the preindustrial (1770s); and from the preindustrial to the present day (1990s). We find that different oxidants have different sensitivities to the uncertainties tested in this study. Ozone is relatively insensitive, whereas OH is the most sensitive: changes in the global mean OH levels for the LGM-to-preindustrial transition range between -29% and +7%, and those for the preindustrial-to-present day transition range between -8% and +17%, across our simulations. We find little variability in the implied relative LGM-preindustrial difference in methane emissions with respect to the uncertainties tested in this study. Conversely, estimates of the preindustrial-to-present-day and LGM-to-preindustrial changes in the global burden of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are highly sensitive. We show that the linear relationship between tropospheric mean OH and tropospheric mean ozone photolysis rates, water vapor, and total emissions of NOx and reactive carbon – first reported in Murray et al. (2014) – does not hold across all periods with the new isoprene photochemistry mechanism. This study demonstrates how inadequacies in our understanding of isoprene emissions and photochemistry impede our ability to constrain the oxidative capacities of the present and past atmospheres, its controlling factors, and the radiative forcing of some short-lived species such as SOA over time.",

            "abstract": "Continent-continent collision follows subduction of oceanic lithosphere and is expected to result in doubly verging orogens with well-developed retro-wedges on the overriding plate. We question this simple view and argue that retro-wedge formation is restricted to specific rheological conditions within the lower and upper plates as well as the plate contact; thus being the exception rather than the rule during collision.\nTwo series of physical analogue experiments have been deployed to infer favourable rheological conditions for the transfer of strain to the upper plate and thus the development of retro-wedges. Subduction of continental lithosphere occurs along a pre-scribed zone of weakness in the mantle lithosphere (series I) or follows subduction of oceanic lithosphere (series II). In either case the contact between the subducting and overriding plate s weak. The degree of plate coupling however is not constant and is together with the rheological structures of the lower and upper plates, in particular the presence of decoupling horizons, key variable in this study.\nAnalogue experiments with strong decoupling at the plate boundary and at the Moho or the brittle-ductile transition of the incoming plate lead to outward propagating mountain belts by successive imbrication of upper crustal thrust sheets independent as to whether collision was preceded by subduction of oceanic lithosphere or not. Under these conditions, which are typical for subduction-dominated orogens like the Carpathians, the Dinarides or the Apennines, no significant retro-wedges with large-displacement retro-shears develop.\nTransfer of strain to the upper plate is favoured when the degree of plate coupling is high, the crust of the colliding and in particular the subducting plate is strong and when the upper plate contains decoupling horizons (e.g. at the Moho or the brittle-ductile transition). Under such conditions large-scale retro-shears develop and deformation propagates outward on the upper plate to form a retro-wedge.\nThese analogue experiments provide insight in past rheological conditions of doubly verging mountain belts, revealing that retro-wedge formation is only possible under restricted rheological conditions.",

            "abstract": "This investigation contributes for bridging the gap in Earth observation between field and airborne measurements. We will reduce the risk of operating science grade instruments from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), by developing robust methods to make well-characterized spectral measurements for integration, calibration and validation with NASAs science quality satellite and airborne data. Because of the potential for rapid deployment, spatially explicit data from UASs can be acquired irrespective of many of the cost, scheduling and logistic limitations to satellite or piloted aircraft missions. Provided that the measurements are suitably calibrated and well characterized, this opens up opportunities for calibration/validation activities not currently available. There is considerable interest in UASs from the agricultural and forestry industries but there is a need to identify a workflow that yields calibrated comparisons through space and time. The goal of our effort is to ensure that optical high spectral resolution measurements from UAV’s are collected and processed in a fashion that allows ready integration with or comparison to NASA satellite and airborne data and derived products. We target the consistent retrieval of calibrated surface reflectance, as well as biological parameters including nutrient and chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic capacity. We will test our technology and protocols first using spatially-resolved discrete point measurements characterizing canopy VNIR reflectance and solar-induced fluorescence, followed by imaging spectroscopy. A Rapid Data Assimilation and delivery system will be developed, based on SensorWeb Intelligent Payload Module for high speed onboard processing. The deployment of UAS sensors at sites such as flux towers will facilitate measrurement validation and parameter retrieval, than is possible by foot, from sensors fixed to a tower, or irregular aircraft missions. We will report preliminary results and outcomes in the project development regarding the accurate measurement of spectral reflectance at high temporal frequencies and stability to depict diurnal/seasonal cycles in vegetation function.",

            "abstract": "Understanding reactive flow in geomaterials is important for optimizing geologic carbon storage practices, such as using pore space efficiently. Flow paths can be complex in large degrees of geologic heterogeneities across scales. In addition, local heterogeneity can evolve as reactive transport processes alter the pore-scale morphology. For example, dissolved carbon dioxide may react with minerals in fractured rocks, confined aquifers, or faults, resulting in heterogeneous cementation (and/or dissolution) and evolving flow conditions. Both path and flow complexities are important and poorly characterized, making it difficult to determine their evolution with traditional 2-D transport models. Here we characterize the development of 3-D pore-scale flow with an evolving pore configuration due to calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation and dissolution. A simple pattern of a microfluidic pore network is used initially and pore structures will become more complex due to precipitation and dissolution processes. At several stages of precipitation and dissolution, we directly visualize 3-D velocity vectors using micro particle image velocimetry and a laser scanning confocal microscope. Measured 3-D velocity vectors are then compared to 3-D simulated flow fields which will be used to simulate reactive transport. Our findings will highlight the importance of the 3-D flow dynamics and its impact on estimating reactive surface area over time.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Rivers (AR’s) play a dominant role in variability of precipitation on the US W. Coast. A major AR study field effort with three research aircraft and the ship RV Ron Brown was conducted in January–February 2015. In this paper we report on analysis of air-sea fluxes computed from near-surface gradients in dropsonde profiles. The method was developed after a deployment of the NOAA G-4 aircraft in 2014 to evaluate observation strategies. The sonde profiles yield gradients of wind speed, potential temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio in the surface layer over the ocean. Surface fluxes can be estimated from these gradients. If sea surface temperature (SST) is available, fluxes can also be computed using a bulk-flux algorithm. Conventional atmospheric sondes do not measure SST, but we developed a method to estimate SST by extrapolating the gradient to the surface. This was effective for temperature and water vapor profiles. A short iteration yielded reasonable estimates of SST and fluxes of momentum, sensible, and latent heat. Based on the 2014 study, uncertainty in a SST estimate is about 0.10 C (std 0.5 C). Here, we will report on results from 12 G-4 missions and 7 P-3 missions from CALWATER2-2015. The P-3 missions included AXBT SST measurements for further comparison.",

            "abstract": "The accuracy of models that forecast atmospheric transport and deposition of tephra to anticipate hazards during volcanic eruptions is limited by the fact that fine ash tends to aggregate and fall out more rapidly than the individual constituent particles. Aggregation is generally accounted for by representing fine ash as aggregates with density ρagg and a log-normal size range with median μagg and standard deviation σagg. Values of these parameters likely vary with eruption type, grain size, and atmospheric conditions. To date, no studies have examined how the values vary from one eruption or deposit to another. In this study, we used the Ash3d tephra model to simulate four deposits: 18 May 1980 Mount St. Helens, 16-17 September 1992 Crater Peak (Mount Spurr), Alaska, 17 June 1996 Ruapehu, and 23 March 2009 Mount Redoubt volcano. In 158 simulations, we systematically varied μagg (1-2.3Φ) and σagg (0.1-0.3Φ), using ellipsoidal aggregates with =600 kg m-3 and a shape factor F≡((b+c)/2a)=0.44 . We evaluated the goodness of fit using three statistical comparisons: modeled versus measured (1) mass load at individual sample locations; (2) mass load versus distance along the dispersal axis; and (3) isomass area. For all deposits, the best-fit μagg ranged narrowly between ~1.6-2.0Φ (0.33-0.25mm), despite large variations in erupted mass (0.25-50 Tg), plume height (8.5-25 km), mass fraction of fine (<0.063mm) ash (3-59%), atmospheric temperature, aggregation mechanism, and water content between these eruptions. This close agreement suggests that the aggregation process may be modeled as a discrete process that is agnostic to the eruptive style or magnitude of eruption. This result paves the way to a simple, computationally-efficient parameterization of aggregation that is suitable for use in operational deposit forecasts. Further research may indicate whether this narrow range also reflects physical constraints on processes in the evolving cloud.",

            "abstract": "Subducting slabs represent strong short wavelength seismic anomalies in the upper mantle where much of Earth’s seismicity is located. As such, they have the potential to bias longer wavelength seismic tomography models. To evaluate the effect of subducting slabs in global tomography, we performed a series of inversion tests using a global synthetic shear wave travel time dataset for a theoretical slab model based on predicted thermal anomalies within slabs. The spectral element method (SEM) was applied to predict the travel time anomalies produced by the 3D slab model for paths corresponding to our current data used in actual tomography models. Inversion tests have been conducted first using the raw travel time anomalies to check how well the slabs can be imaged in global tomography without the effect of mislocation. Our results indicate that most of the slabs can be identified in the inversion result but with smoothed and reduced amplitude. The recovery of the total mass anomaly in slab regions is about 84%. We then performed another inversion test to investigate the effect of mislocation caused by subducting slabs. We found that source mislocation significantly degrades the imaging of subducting slabs – potentially reducimg the recovery of mass anomalies in slab regions to only 39%. We tested two source relocation procedures – an iterative relocation inversion and joint relocation inversion. Both methods partially recover the true source locations and improve the inversion results, but the joint inversion method worked significantly better than the iterative method. In all of our inversion tests, the amplitude of artifact structures in the lower mantle caused by the incorrect imaging of slabs (up to ~0.5% S velocity anomalies) are comparable to large scale lower mantle heterogeneities seen in global tomography studies.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the sediment dynamics of the low-flow channel of the Santa Ana River that is formed by wastewater discharges and contains some of the last remaining habitat of the Santa Ana Sucker (Catostomus santaanae). The Santa Ana River is a highly-modified river draining the San Bernardino Mountains and Inland Empire metropolitan area east of Los Angeles. Home to over 4 million people, the watershed provides habitat for the federally-threatened Santa Ana Sucker, which presently reside within the mainstem Santa Ana River in a reach supported by year-round constant discharges from water treatment plants. The nearly constant low-flow wastewater discharges and infrequent runoff events create a small, approximately 8 m wide, inset channel within the approximately 300 m wide mainstem channel that is typically dry except for large flood flows. The sediment dynamics within the inset channel are characterized by constantly evolving bed substrate and sediment transport rates, and occasional channel avulsions. The sediment dynamics have large influence on the Sucker, which rely on coarse-substrate (gravel and cobble) for their food production. In WY 2013 through the present, we investigated the sediment dynamics of the inset channel using repeat bathymetric and substrate surveys, bedload sampling, and discharge measurements. We found two distinct phases of the inset channel behavior: 1. ‘Reset’ flows, where sediment-laden mainstem discharges from upstream runoff events result in sand deposition in the inset channel or avulse the inset channel onto previously dry riverbed; and 2. ‘Winnowing’ flows, whereby the sand within the inset channel is removed by clear-water low flows from the wastewater treatment plant discharges. Thus, in contrast to many regulated rivers where high flows are required to flush fine sediments from the bed (for example, downstream from dams), in the Santa Ana River the low flows from wastewater treatment plants serve as the flushing flows that gradually remove sand and expose the coarser substrate. In effect, the inset channel is analogous to a flume subject to periodic sediment loading events from upstream (runoff events) with long periods of negligible upstream sediment supply between the events (wastewater discharges).",

            "abstract": "There has been a considerable amount of research linking climatic variability to hydrologic responses in arid and semi-arid regions such as the western United States. Although much effort has been spent to assess and predict changes in surface-water resources, little has been done to understand how climatic events and changes affect groundwater resources. This study focuses on quantifying the effects of large quasi-decadal groundwater recharge events on groundwater in the northern Utah portion of the Great Basin for the period 1960 to 2013. Groundwater-level monitoring data were analyzed with climatic data to characterize climatic conditions and frequency of these large recharge events. Using observed water-level changes and multivariate analysis, five large groundwater recharge events were identified within the study area and period, with a frequency of about 11 to 13 years. These events were generally characterized as having above-average annual precipitation and snow water equivalent and below-average seasonal temperatures, especially during the spring (April through June). Existing groundwater flow models for several basins within the study area were used to quantify changes in groundwater storage from these events. Simulated groundwater storage increases per basin from a single event ranged from about 115 Mm3 (93,000 acre-feet) to 205 Mm3 (166,000 acre-ft). Extrapolating these amounts over the entire northern Great Basin indicates that even a single large quasi-decadal recharge event could result in billions of cubic meters (millions of acre-feet) of groundwater recharge. Understanding the role of these large quasi-decadal recharge events in replenishing aquifers and sustaining water supplies is crucial for making informed water management decisions.",

Crustal anisotropy is quantified by using the sinusoidal moveout of the P-to-S converted phases from the Moho, and the integrated crustal/mantle anisotropy is measured using SKS, SKKS, and PKS (XKS) data recorded by 385 stations. A total of 3310 pairs of well-defined XKS splitting parameters are observed in the vicinity of the so-called Great Lakes Mantle Divot and adjacent areas. The measurements show systematic spatial variation of anisotropic characteristics. Fast polarization orientations subparallel to the absolute plate motion (APM) of North America are observed at most stations on and east of the Appalachians in the latitudinal range of 40° to 50°N with large splitting times (up to 1.7s). This area has a thin lithosphere relative to the continental interior to the west, indicating an asthenospheric origin for the observed azimuthally invariant splitting parameters which reflect a single-layer of anisotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry. The dominant crustal anisotropy in this area is N-S oriented. Azimuthal varying splitting parameters are observed at most stations in the vicinity of the Great Lakes Mantle Divot, and can be adequately explained by a two-horizontal layer model. The lower layer has an APM-parallel fast orientation and the fast orientation of the upper layer is mostly consistent with the crust anisotropy. Based on the splitting measurements and previous seismic tomography studies, a model involving deflecting of asthenosphere flow by the undulating bottom of the lithosphere is proposed.",

            "abstract": "The \"Cafe Scientifique\" (or \"Science Cafe\") has existed around the\nworld for decades. In an informal setting, one or more scientists\nengage with a lay audience, typically over refreshments of some kind.\nThese Science Cafes have taken many formats and taken place in many\nvenues. Some feature a single presenter, some multiple; some\ncongregate in large venues, some small; some restrict the use of the\npowerpoint slides, some do not.\nOur team at Dartmouth has hosted \"Science Pubs\" for three years. Our\nScience Pub takes place in a local pub, from 5-7pm on a weekday once a\nmonth. We choose a theme for a pub and select three presenters. The\ncomposition of our panel varies, but we generally have at least one\nfaculty member and one \"less-academic\" member, such as a town planner\nwhen discussing hurricanes or an organic farmer when discussing\npesticides. Often we include a graduate student in the panel. The\nPub takes place in three \"acts\": 1) the presenters each give a brief\nintroduction to thier take on the topic, usually 10-15 minutes,\nextemporaneous with no slides, 2) the \"wedding reception\" phase, which\nis a break during which the presenters circulate to the pub tables,\nanswering questions and chatting with the attendees informally, and 3)\nreconvening for a more 'formal' question and answer period during\nwhich the presenters answer questions from the audience.\nHere, we outline the format that makes up a Dartmouth Science Pub and\nshare insignts and lessons learned. Among many findings, we have\nlearned: 1) a group of three presenters makes for a lively discussion,\nas often presenters 'riff' off one another's points, 2) it is cruical\nto have a facilitator, to 'run the show', freeing the science\npresenters to concentrate on thier audience engagement, and 3) a short\nmeeting ahead of time with the presenters is simple and very important\nin creating a smooth event, and serves to help the presenters 'code\nswitch' and adapt language, in lieu of a formal 'training'.",

            "abstract": "The efficacy of geophysical data to estimate key subsurface parameters is difficult to quantify given the complexity of both the signal and the earth, among many other factors. To address this, we utilize a metric from decision analysis known as the value of information (VOI). We analyze the uncertainty of surface-wave dispersion curves derived from travel times recorded by two types of seismological sensors: 3-component seismometers and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), a technique for measuring longitudinal strain in fiber-optic cables. Both data types were recorded at the Garner Valley test site in California. A 45 kN shear-shaker source produced a swept-frequency input from a few Hz to 10 Hz and back over 60 seconds. The geophone and DAS traces were filtered to remove harmonics from the source, traffic and other external noise. Source-Synchronous Filtering (Lord et al., AGU 2015) was applied to obtain waveforms. To measure the travel time from the source to the sensor, multiple zero-crossings are picked for frequencies between 4 and 20 Hz. These picks are used to estimate phase velocities as a function of frequency for both data types by plotting the travel times versus the distance of the sensor from the source. The slope of the best-fitting line provides an estimate of the phase velocity at a given frequency. To assess its uncertainty, we use a nonparametric bootstrap procedure [Efron & Tibshirani, 1986]. The resulting distributions of phase velocities describe the precision of the estimates for each data type. We then plot the phase velocities as a function of their frequency to generate many dispersion curves. These dispersion curves are inverted to estimate the posterior distribution of shear wave velocity with depth for each type of data. We hypothesize that this information is used to make a decision (e.g. how to develop a geothermal field), and therefore the VOI technique can be applied. This approach provides a metric for evaluating the VOI of each of the two data types. This research is part of the larger PoroTomo project\nhttp://geoscience.wisc.edu/feigl/porotomo\n.",

            "abstract": "Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs), thought to result from reconnection in the near Earth plasma sheet, transfer a significant amount of mass and energy to the inner magnetosphere. The BBF braking region occurs at roughly 10 RE as the flow encounters the dipolar field near Earth and must slow significantly and/or deflect. Previous studies using the THEMIS spacecraft observed electron phase space holes and double-layers in the BBF braking region and speculated that strong field-aligned currents generated by turbulence within the region created these structures. While evidence supporting the existence of turbulence within the region was found, the lack of small-scale spatial information from THEMIS made it difficult to characterize the turbulence and currents within the region. In the present study, BBF braking region observations from the recently launched Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission are examined. Characteristics of the turbulence are examined through statistical methods such as spatial and temporal correlation functions. Individual structures within the turbulence will also be examined using multi-spacecraft techniques to better characterize the currents, which may contribute to the formation of kinetic structures and dissipation of turbulent energy.",

            "abstract": "Temperature (T) is a major determinant of microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). Quantifying T responses of microbial C fluxes is crucial to improve predictions of SOM dynamics and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but interpretation of experimental data is complicated by many properties inherent to soils. Comparing such data with complementary, reductionist experiments can help to identify basic mechanisms and interpret soil measurements.\nWe quantified T effects on activity levels (i.e., rates of substrate cleavage) of microbial extracellular enzymes β-glucosidase (BGase) and β-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAGase), and on rates of CO2 efflux in soil incubations. We compare the results to those derived from purified enzyme assays, and to measurements of microbial respiration rates in continuous-flow chemostat culture in which a population of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens was grown on medium with similar C:N ratio as the incubated SOM (10:1).\nActivity levels of both BGase and NAGase decreased by 80% between 25 and 5 °C. These T responses were higher than predictions from intrinsic (i.e., maximum) T responses in purified assays of BGase (minus 50%) and NAGase (minus 67%). This suggests that factors like physical access to substrate or reduced microbial production of enzymes constrained substrate decomposition rates in the soils relatively more at low than at high T.\nIn chemostats, (mass-)specific bacterial respiration rate at T 14.5 °C was 50% of the rate observed at 26.5 °C; in contrast, CO2 efflux from the soil incubations decreased by only ~25% from 25 to 15 °C. The reason for this discrepancy can be manifold, including changes in microbial community composition, but results from ongoing measurements of microbial biomass in the soil samples will allow a closer comparison of these respiration rate responses.\nOur efforts highlight the significance of experimenting across scales and complexity for a better understanding of SOM dynamics.",

A very large collection of artifacts unearthed from these sites, in particular several thousands of well-documented pottery fragments, is now stored at the Archeological Institute in Moscow. We collected a time-sequential series of groups of potsherds from the multilayered settlement called Yarim Tepe II dated to the Halaf period (6th millennium BC). Each group comprises a minimum of 3 potsherds (up to 10) found within a same archeological layer, typically a thickness of about 20 cm. Altogether, the fragment groups encompass the entire 7-m thick stratigraphic sequence of Yarim Tepe II. We will present our first archeointensity results obtained using the experimental protocol developed for the Triaxe magnetometer, taking into account the effects of both the thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) anisotropy and the cooling rate dependence on TRM acquisition. The new data help to better constrain the geomagnetic field intensity variations in the Middle East during the 6th millennium BC. Thanks to the comparison with other datasets from Bulgaria and Syria, the new archeointensity results provide evidence for the occurrence of very rapid geomagnetic field intensity variations around 5500 BC.",

This study examines volatile content and vesicle size distributions in a suite of samples collected from the 2011 eruption of Axial Seamount. The samples exhibit a wide range of dissolved CO2 concentrations (68 – 339 ppm), low H2O concentrations (0.17 – 0.26 wt %), and consistent supersaturation relative to the expected CO2-H2O phase equilibrium in basaltic melts. The vesicularity, characteristic bubble radii, and bubble number density correlate with the dissolved volatile concentrations and indicate that bubble nucleation and growth occur within a closed system. The extent of degassing increases with distance from the eruptive vent and variations are also observed along the eruptive fissure providing a spatially resolved record of eruption dynamics. A bubble growth model is used to constrain the minimum ascent rates, eruption duration, and flow rates for the 2011 eruption. These results are compared to similar data from the global mid-ocean ridge system to evaluate differences in timescales of emplacement and ascent in MOR eruptions. ",

            "abstract": "Much of the interest in hydrological modeling in the past decades revolved around resolving spatial variability. With the rapid changes brought about by human impacts on the hydrologic cycle, there is now an increasing need to refocus on time dependency. We present a co-evolutionary view of hydrologic systems, in which every part of the system including human systems, co-evolve, albeit at different rates. The resulting coupled human-nature system is framed as a dynamical system, characterized by interactions of fast and slow time scales and feedbacks between environmental and social processes. This gives rise to emergent phenomena such as the levee effect, adaptation to change and system collapse due to resource depletion. Changing human values play a key role in the emergence of these phenomena and should therefore be considered as internal to the system in a dynamic way. The co-evolutionary approach differs from the traditional view of water resource systems analysis as it allows for path dependence, multiple equilibria, lock-in situations and emergent phenomena. The approach may assist strategic water management for long time scales through facilitating stakeholder participation, exploring the possibility space of alternative futures, and helping to synthesise the observed dynamics of different case studies. Future research opportunities include the study of how changes in human values are connected to human-water interactions, historical analyses of trajectories of system co-evolution in individual places and comparative analyses of contrasting human-water systems in different climate and socio-economic settings.\n",

            "abstract": "Flood basalts are the most significant magmatic events on the planet, influencing our environment by modifying the lithosphere and atmosphere. Our understanding of flood basalt processes comes almost entirely from within the rock record – typically a vast pile of basaltic lavas, hiatuses, and sedimentary horizons. Stratigraphic continuity is thus a critical characteristic to constrain the processes associated with the formation of flood basalt provinces. Oceanic flood basalts are difficult to access in situ, leaving continental equivalents our primary target. The Oligocene Ethiopian Traps is among the youngest and most intact flood basalt provinces, making this a premier region to examine flood basalt stratigraphy. Leveraging recent road building, we have constructed a flow by flow stratigraphy for two ~1500m independent sections of the Low-Ti region of the Ethiopian traps, separated by ~70 km. These sections lie towards the edge of the modern exposure of the Ethiopian flood basalts, however the remarkable parallelism of flows and the lack of evidence of pinching suggests that the province was significantly more aerially extensive towards the west. For the most continuous ~1200m section, median flow thickness is about ~15m in the lower ~400m and upper ~400m of the flood basalt sequence, but flows thin significantly to a median of 4m in the central portion of this sequence. The petrography shows distinctive patterns through the pile: largely aphyric and clinopyroxene/olivine phyric flows are more common towards the base of the sequence and transition to largely plagioclase phyric basalts. At the top of the flood basalt pile a further transition from plagioclase phyric to largely aphyric flows is observed. Paleosols become more frequent and are thicker towards the top of the sequence. These observations point to a gradual temporal shift in the differentiation depths and flux of magmas entering the Ethiopian lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen is one of the main building blocks of life on Earth and its elemental cycle is deeply connected with organic matter and the biological system. It is known that nitrogen can be stored in mantellic phases (such as clinopyroxenes) or in metallic alloys under high pressures, meaning that Earth’s mantle, and even the core, could be efficient nitrogen reservoirs. Probably, nitrogen is present in these deep Earth systems since the formation of our planet. Nevertheless, it is possible that superficial nitrogen can be reintroduced in the mantle through tectonic processes along Earth history. This is reinforced by d15N values in inclusions in diamonds and other deep mantle phases. We believe that subduction zones are efficient enough to transport nitrogen from surface to mantle. Clay minerals with high charge exchange capacity (CEC) are good candidates to convey nitrogen in subduction zones, especially when we take into account the similarities between K+ and NH4+. To simulate the high-pressure high-temperature conditions found in subduction zones, we performed a series of experiments with montmorillonite clay mineral undergone to high pressure and high temperature produced by a hydraulic press coupled with toroidal chambers, in pressures ranging from 2.5 to 7.7 GPa and temperatures up to 700oC. We used ex situ XRD analysis to accompany the main montmorillonite structural changes and FTIR analysis to determine quantitatively the presence of nitrogen. So far, our results show that the main structural transition in montmorillonite happens at ~350oC at room pressure and ~450oC at 2.5 and 4.0 GPa and consists in the transformation of an open clay structure to a closed mica structure (tobelite). FTIR data show the presence of nitrogen in all the analysed experiments. With the data obtained, we can presume that clay minerals carried in subduction zones can successfully transport nitrogen and other volatiles to the mantle. However, only cold subduction systems have the correct thermal behaviour to do so (such as Valparaiso). In hot systems (such as Cascadia), melting of clays occur in shallow depths and volatiles are liberated in the volcanic front.",

            "abstract": "Polar-orbiting multi-band meteorological sensors such as those on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite pose substantial challenges for taking imagery the last mile to forecast offices, scientific analysis environments, and the general public. To do this quickly and easily, the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin has created an open-source, modular application system, Polar2Grid. This bundled solution automates tools for converting various satellite products like those from VIIRS and MODIS into a variety of output formats, including GeoTIFFs, AWIPS compatible NetCDF files, and NinJo forecasting workstation compatible TIFF images. In addition to traditional visible and infrared imagery, Polar2Grid includes three perceptual enhancements for the VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB), as well as providing the capability to create sharpened true color, sharpened false color, and user-defined RGB images. Polar2Grid performs conversions and projections in seconds on large swaths of data. Polar2Grid is currently providing VIIRS imagery over the Continental United States, as well as Alaska and Hawaii, from various Direct-Broadcast antennas to operational forecasters at the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) offices in their AWIPS terminals, within minutes of an overpass of the Suomi NPP satellite. Three years after Polar2Grid development started, the Polar2Grid team is now releasing version 2.0 of the software; supporting more sensors, generating more products, and providing all of its features in an easy to use command line interface.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica are a unique ice-free landscape that supports complex, microbially dominated ecosystems despite the harsh environment (<10 cm water equivalent/yr, -18°C mean air temperature). Recent observations suggest that this region is nearing a threshold of rapid landscape change. One such observation was the recent discovery of extensive thermokarst development (permafrost thaw features) along the banks of Crescent Stream in Taylor Valley. In 2012, a large stretch of the West Branch of Crescent Stream had significant bank failures, while the adjacent East Branch was unaffected. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of land surface change occurring on the stream bank, and the impacts of the sediment loading on the stream bed material. Three annually repeated terrestrial LiDAR scans were compared to determine the rates of ground surface change due to thermokarst degradation on the stream bank. The areal extent of the thermokarst was shown to be decreasing, however the average vertical erosion rate remained constant. Field measurements including, pebble counts, fine sediment counts, and sieve samples were collected and analyzed to determine the effects of the introduction of fine sediment on the stream bed material. The bed sediment of the thermokarst-impacted branch was consistently finer than the adjacent unaffected branch. The fine material introduced to the stream altered the bed material composition, which consequently increased the mobility of the of the bed material. These changes imposed on the stream have implications for stream morphology, endemic algal mat communities, and downstream aquatic systems.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly stated that the hydrological cycle ‘intensifies’ under global warming. It has also been posited that this intensification is realized as an increase in global precipitation that is a slave to the availability of water determined by thermodynamically constrained increases of water vapor. This increase in global precipitation is referred to as the hydrological sensitivity of the climate system and it is only indirectly controlled by water vapor but through the latters influence on radiative fluxes. These radiative controls of the hydrological sensitivity are illustrated by analysis of CMIP5 data and the factors that determine the magnitude of the sensitivity are emphasized. The role of hemispheric differences in radiation balance on the hydrological sensitivity is also described.",

Here we analyze depth-integrated steric sea-level changes using the CMIP5 models and a new CESM ensemble that samples internal variability of the coupled Earth system. The CESM ensemble contains 50 members, with historical and future projections (1850-2100) initialized from unique model states sampled from a ~10,000 year fully coupled unforced equilibrium simulation. The CESM ensemble enables us to examine how initial conditions uncertainty (internal variability) within the full-ocean can influence depth-integrated steric sea-level variability. The second ensemble is comprised of runs from 32 different CMIP5 models. We performed grid-level drift correction for each model using the pre-industrial control simulations, which enables us to examine depth-integrated variability and trends due to different model structures. We compare and contrast our results with published observational datasets, and we analyze the effect of different sources of uncertainty on simulated sea-level variability and trends for different ocean depths. Results point to the importance of the deep ocean in attempting to attribute and predict temporal patterns of steric sea-level on a global scale.",

            "abstract": "The amount of water in the Earth’s atmosphere is tiny compared to all other sources of water on our planet, fresh or otherwise. However, this tiny amount of water is fundamental to most aspects of human life. The tiny amount of water that cycles from the Earth’s surface, through condensation into clouds in the atmosphere returning as precipitation falling is not only natures way of delivering fresh water to land-locked human societies but it also exerts a fundamental control on our climate system producing the most important feedbacks in the system. The representation of these processes in Earth system models contain many errors that produce well now biases in the hydrological cycle. Surprisingly the parameterizations of these important processes are not well validated with observations. Part of the reason for this situation stems from the fact that process evaluation is difficult to achieve on the global scale since it has commonly been assumed that the static observations available from snap-shots of individual parameters contain little information on processes. One of the successes of the A-Train has been the development of multi-parameter analysis based on the multi-sensor data produced by the satellite constellation. This has led to new insights on how water cycles through the Earth’s atmosphere. Examples of these insights will be highlighted. It will be described how the rain formation process has been observed and how this has been used to constrain this process in models, with a huge impact. How these observations are beginning to reveal insights on deep convection and examples of the use these observations applied to models will also be highlighted as will the effects of aerosol on clouds on radiation.",

Although auroral brightening is often attributed to field-aligned currents (FACs) in the SCW produced by flow vorticity and pressure redistribution, in-situ observations addressing the mechanism that generates these currents have been scarce. Conjugate observations and modelling results utilizing magnetotail satellites, inversion technique for SCW, and auroral imagers were used to study the release, transport, and accumulation of magnetic flux by flows; dipolarization associated with substorm current wedge formation; and auroral poleward expansion during an isolated substorm on 13 February 2008. During early expansion phase, magnetic flux released by magnetic reconnection was transported by earthward flows. Some magnetic flux was accumulated in the near-Earth region, and the remainder was transported azimuthally by flow diversion. The accumulated flux created a high pressure region with vertically dipolarized and azimuthally bent magnetic field lines. The rotation of the magnetic field lines was consistent with the polarity of the SCW. In the near-Earth region, good agreement was found among the magnetic flux transported by the flows, the accumulated flux causing dipolarization inside the SCW, and the flux enclosed within the poleward-expanded auroral oval. This agreement demonstrates that magnetic flux from the flows accumulated and generated the SCW, the magnetic dipolarization, and the auroral poleward expansion. The quantity of accumulated flux appears to determine the amplitudes of these phenomena.",

However, it still remains unclear how electrons behave and gain energies within the diffusion region, particularly on electron-scale. Here we report a detection of the electron diffusion region (EDR) by the THEMIS P1 spacecraft during a magnetotail reconnection event of 2009 February 7 with no appreciable guide field. Heated electrons were found in association with correlated reversals of plasma flows and magnetic fields, and the heating were primarily in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Some of the distributions of the heated electrons were non-gyrotropic. We conclude that these features are evidences of EDR and that electron energization occurred in at least two steps because there was a pre-heating in the immediate upstream of the EDR. These established signatures of the EDR will help future analysis of data from MMS which, with its super high-time resolution, will be able to fully resolve the EDR.",

            "abstract": "The Solar Probe Plus trajectory, approaching within 10 solar radii, will enable the white light imager, WISPR, to fly through corona features now only imaged remotely. The dependency of the Thomson scattering on the imaging geometry (distance and angle from the Sun) dictates that the outer WISPR telescope will be sensitive to the emission from plasma close to the spacecraft, in contrast to the situation for imaging from Earth orbit. Thus WISPR will be the first ‘local’ imager providing a crucial link between the large-scale corona and SPP’s in-situ measurements. The high speed at perihelion will provide tomographic-like views of coronal structures at ≤1° resolution. As SPP approaches perihelion, WISPR, with a 95° radial by 58° transverse field of view, will resolve the fine-scale structure with high spatial resolution. To prepare for this unprecedented viewing of the structure of the inner corona, we are creating synthetic white light images and animations from the WISPR viewpoint using the white-light ray-tracing package developed at NRL (available through SolarSoft). We will present simulated observations of multi-strand models of coronal streamers and flux ropes of various size and make comparisons with views from Earth, Solar Orbiter and SPP. Analysis techniques for WISPR images will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Griggs deformation apparatus is increasingly used for shear experiments. The tested material is placed on a 45° pre-cut between two forcing blocks. During the experiment, the axial displacement, load, temperature, and confining pressure are recorded as a function of time. From these records, stress, strain, and other mechanical data can be calculated - provided the machine is calibrated.\nExperimentalists are well aware that calibrating a Griggs apparatus is not easy. The stiffness correction accounts for the elastic extension of the rig as load is applied to the sample. An ‘area correction’ accounts for the decreasing overlap of the forcing blocks as slip along the pre-cut progresses. Other corrections are sometimes used to account for machine specific behaviour. While the rig stiffness can be measured very accurately, the area correction involves model assumptions. Depending on the choice of the model, the calculated stresses may vary by as much as 100 MPa. Also, while the assumptions appear to be theoretically valid, in practice they tend to over-correct the data, yielding strain hardening curves even in cases where constant flow stress or weakening is expected.\nUsing the results of experiments on quartz gouge at the quartz-coesite transition (see Richter et al. this conference), we are now able to improve and constrain our corrections. We introduce an elastic salt correction based on the assumption that the confining pressure is increased as the piston advances and reduces the volume in the confining medium. As the compressibility of salt is low, the correction is significant and increases with strain. Applying this correction, the strain hardening artefact introduced by the area correction can be counter-balanced. Using a combination of area correction and salt correction we can now reproduce strain weakening, for which there is evidence in samples where coesite transforms back to quartz.",

Indeed the 21st century in California is already notable for the warm and dry conditions that have transpired. Expected impacts of climate change including greater variability, warmer temperatures, and more precipitation falling as rain than snow seem to be evident in the current drought. As such, can current conditions like the 2015 record low snowpack and its associated precipitation distribution be used as an object lesson of what may lie ahead for California in the 21st century with climate change? Through an examination of various observed records, perspective is provided on the current drought as well as the 21st century so far with comparisons to past events including the paleo-record. Looking ahead using information ranging from seasonal forecasts to climate projections, thoughts are provided on what lies ahead for California and what knowledge gaps inhibit adaptive planning and operational response.",

            "abstract": "Increasing the horizontal resolution of the sea ice and ocean components in a global climate model has been shown to affect the extent of sea ice and the strength of atmosphere/ocean fluxes. Since existing high-resolution (0.1°) coupled simulations include a dynamical ocean, it is difficult to pinpoint how these results are influenced by the resolution of the sea ice. This project takes a closer look at the impact of sea ice resolution on ocean/atmosphere interactions in the Southern Hemisphere using the Community Earth System Model (CESM1-CAM5) in a slab ocean configuration. In this set-up, sea ice and mixed layer ocean models on a 0.1° grid (high resolution) or 1° grid (standard resolution) are coupled with atmosphere and land models run at the same 0.5° resolution. The high resolution model can produce fine scale, open water areas within the ice pack that facilitate air/sea flux exchanges and reduce the stability of the lower atmosphere in the model. Correlations between sea ice concentration and boundary layer variables will be described at different spatial scales to understand the effects of resolving small scale features. Finally, a kernel feedback analysis will be shown on a 0.1°, double CO2 run to look at the impact of sea ice resolution on the regional lapse rate feedback.",

            "abstract": "On the shortest time scales, the basal interfaces of glaciers and ice sheets behave elastically. Some of the most prominent consequences of this behavior come from observations of the tidal response at very low effective stresses in the vicinity of sticky spots. Over the short duration of slip events on the Whillans Ice Plain, we can model flow in the vicinity of a sticky spot by equating the sum of elastic and tidal stresses with frictional resistance described by a velocity-weakening, rate-and-state formulation.\nOur model domain is approximated as a rectangle with flow-perpendicular width W, and flow-parallel length L. For the background flow we impose a constant rate vice long the up- and down-dip boundaries, and set the flow rate to zero at the ridges that are represented by the flow-perpendicular boundaries. To facilitate a 1D treatment, we assume that stress along the ice base varies only in the direction perpendicular to flow. We examine the elastic response to stress accumulation at a single sticky spot that is centered within the model domain. The frictional constitutive parameters are assumed constant over the entire model domain. The sticky spot is characterized by an increase in the effective stress from its background level of N = σ elsewhere to an enhanced value of N = 10σ – 100σ within the sticky spot itself.\nWe report simulations where the entire sticky spot ruptures twice per tidal period, and is effectively locked in the intervals between sliding; a few events do not rupture the entire sticky spot. The poorly drained, low stress regions on either side of the sticky spot slide at speeds slightly below vice during the entire simulation, while the sticky spot reaches slip speeds of ~100vice when it ruptures. Sticky spot ruptures occur near both the minimum and maximum tidal stresses. Increasing the tidal forcing amplitude produces more frequent, smaller ruptures, and the behavior becomes less correlated with changes in tidal resistance. Decreasing the sticky spot effective stress causes the behavior to become more chaotic, with the sticky spot showing no obvious periodic response to the tidal signal.",

            "abstract": "The loss of continental groundwater to the oceans during the past century has elevated sea level by ~25(±5) mm, and has caused ~0.7mm/yr of sea level rise since 2005. The mass unloading associated with this groundwater depletion induces elastic uplift of Earth’s solid surface and depresses the gravitational equipotential surface that defines sea level. Together, these deflections should cause slower relative sea level rise near areas of continental groundwater loss. We estimated these variations in sea level change using a model of the solid Earth’s response to estimates of groundwater depletion during the past century. We find large negative deviations in relative sea level near California, Western India, the western Yellow Sea and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Relative sea level measured by tide gauges in these areas show slower sea level rise rates compared to global averages. For example, on the western coast of India (e.g., Karachi), groundwater-induced deviations from global average sea level rise can exceed -40 mm, and our model predicts ~1 mm/yr of sea level drop since 2005. Correcting tide gauge records for groundwater depletion using our model improves their fit to the global trend estimated by Church & White (2011), and further reduces the variation of rise rates observed among regional groups of stations. We reconstructed Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) between 1930 and 2009 taking in account groundwater depletion corrections determined from our model. We found that including groundwater depletion increases our estimate of the global rate of change of GMSL from 1.81 to 1.88 mm/yr during this time period because the observed rise at some key stations is slowed by nearby groundwater depletion. For the past 20 years, including groundwater depletion increases GMSL from 3.32mm/yr to 3.46mm/yr. Quantifying the spatial variability of sea level associated with groundwater depletion is important for understanding the variety of factors that affect sea level, and could contribute to more accurate regional forecasts of future sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "The goal to stabilize global average surface temperature at 2oC above pre-industrial level has been extensively discussed in climate negotiations. A number of recent publications state that achieving this goal will require net anthropogenic carbon emissions (which may include a carbon sink by carbon capture and sequestration and reforestation) to be reduced to zero between years 2050 and 2100. In this study we explore possible emission scenarios under which surface warming will not exceed 2oC, by means of emission driven climate simulations with an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity linked to an Economic Projection and Policy Analysis Model. We carried out a number of simulations from 1861 to 2500 for different values of parameters defining the strength of the climate system response to radiative forcing and the strength of the carbon cycle and under different anthropogenic emission scenarios.\nResults of our simulations suggest that anthropogenic emissions do not have to be zero by 2050 or 2100 because of carbon sinks in oceans and terrestrial ecosystems. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions falling from today’s 36 GtCO2/year to 11-25 GtCO2/year by 2050 and then to 4.5-12 GtCO2/year by 2100 is consistent with a 2°C target for the range of climate sensitivity similar to the IPCC likely range.\nLong-term changes in the surface temperature depend on the emissions profiles after 2100. For post-2100 carbon emissions decreasing at a rate of about 0.2% per year, natural ecosystems will be able to absorb enough carbon, that together with decreases in emissions of other GHGs, can prevent surface temperature from rising.\nTechnology mixes and costs to achieve the 2°C target are highly dependent on the assumptions about the future costs of low-carbon and zero-carbon technologies. In all scenarios, the energy system required substantial transformations in a relatively short time. Under current assumptions about the cost trajectories for the needed technologies, the 2°C stabilization would incur a reduction in global consumption of goods and services (relative to no climate policy) of 5-10% in 2050 and 15-22% in 2100.",

            "abstract": "In January 2015, a pair of M3.6 earthquakes and numerous M3+ occurred along the border of Irving and Dallas, Texas, in a heavily populated portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. The Irving-Dallas swarm occurs at the eastern edge of the Fort Worth (Barnett Shale) Basin, an active shale gas production area associated with induced earthquakes. However, the nearest injection well is over 10 km to the northwest and the only nearby production well shutdown in 2012. The cause of the current swarm remains unknown. A temporary seismic network was deployed in early January 2015 to acquire data to improve earthquake location estimates and better characterize the earthquake sequence. Twenty-four stations were deployed, including 13 short-term Texans and 2 USGS NetQuakes instruments. Here, we present high-resolution relative earthquake locations derived using waveform cross-correlation and double difference techniques using both P and S-waves. Waveform data shows a high degree of similarity for both phases throughout the sequence. The P-wave data exhibit power at frequencies ranging from 10 to 40 Hz, while the S-wave data typically exhibit power in the range of 2 to 10 Hz. Initial catalog locations (January-July, 2015) reveal a spatially concentrated sequence of over 480 events, ranging from M0.0 to M3.6, migrating along a NE-SW striking fault. The sequence migrated from southwest to northeast over 4 km in January, but has since migrated back to the southwest. Events occur between 4-8 km in depth, consistent with faulting in the Precambrian basement. Fault plane solutions and event locations suggest a ~70° SE dipping normal fault. Event locations within or near the granitic basement, a series of M3.3+ events, a fault area of ~16 km2, and a NE-SW trending normal fault are consistent with the characteristics of previous North Texas earthquake sequences.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine how long nontronite clays persist in soil, by studying samples collected from a sediment cone weathering out of crack in a basalt outcrop near Moscow Idaho. Nontronite, a dioctahedral ferric smectite clay, is a frequent weathering product of basaltic rocks. However, it is rarely described in surface soils, even in basaltic terrains. At our field site, nontronite formed by basalt weathering is eroding from cracks in the basalt and forming small talus cones. We are examining samples collected from a trench and several soil cores to determine the clay mineralogy at different depths in the talus cone. Bulk and clay mineralogy is being determined using X-ray Diffractometry (XRD) analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. Bulk chemical analyses, and selective extractions with acid oxalate and citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite reagents, are being used to analyze Fe mineralogy and amorphous constituents. Preliminary observations suggest that iron mineralogy may vary with depth in the sediments, and that older, deeper sediments may contain more Fe in oxide phases. We hypothesize that nontronite in the sediments is decomposing over time to form low-Fe smectites + Fe oxides. The results of this study will help determine whether nontronite is stable to erosion and redeposition in a surficial environment, as well as the timescale of its possible decomposition. These results may be useful in assessing proposed models of nontronite transport and redeposition on Mars.",

            "abstract": "Early climate change ideas predicted catastrophic species extinctions. As scientists probed more deeply into species responses, a more nuanced perspective emerged indicating that some species may persist in microrefugia (refugia), especially in mountainous terrain. Refugia are habitat that buffer climate changes and allows species to persist in – and to potentially expand under – changing environmental conditions. While climate and species interactions in refugia have been noted as sources of uncertainty, land management practices and disturbances, such as wildland fire, must also be considered when assessing any given refugium. Our landscape scale study suggests that areas thought to act as small-scale refugia, cold-air pools, have unique fire occurrence and severity patterns in frequent-fire mixed conifer forests of California’s Sierra Nevada: cold-air pool refugia have less fire and if it occurs, it is lower severity. Active management for climate change adaptation strategies may be required to maintain these distinctive and potentially important refugia.",

            "abstract": "In many cities, green infrastructure is increasingly used to capture and treat stormwater runoff, due to the many opportunities these systems afford for protecting receiving water quality and ecology while mitigating water scarcity. Here, we focus on how plants affect the removal of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in newly-constructed stormwater biofilters, a type of green infrastructure consisting of unconsolidated granular media containing one or more plant species. Input-response experiments were carried out using both non-reactive (salt) and reactive (sewage) tracers on six laboratory-scale (~1m long by 24 cm diameter) biofilters, half of which were planted with the sedge Carex appressa (treatment replicates) and half of which were unplanted (control replicates). C. appressa modifies the residence time distribution (RTD) in a biofilter by creating preferential flow paths along which water and mass can move quickly, but does not appear to alter the intrinsic rate at which FIB are removed. Thus, the “green” component of green infrastructure can alter pollutant removal by changing the RTD, with or without a concomitant change in pollutant reactivity.",

Substantial land cover/use change in the recent past, driven by a combination of post-liberalization, socio-economic changes as well as extreme climatic events has resulted in degradation of grasslands in structure and function, for e.g., their carbon sequestration ability. Hence there is a need for precise estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB). In this study, we collected surface reflectance spectra from field radiometry and quadrats and line transects, which include percentage of ground cover, vegetation height, above ground biomass, and species richness, during the growing season, between the periods, 2006-2011 in IM and 2011-2015 in MG. The field sampling was stratified by the dominant vegetation types on the plateau, including the meadow steppe, typical steppe, and the desert steppe. These sampling data were used as training and validation data for developing and testing predictive models for total herbaceous vegetation, and AGB, using Landsat and MODIS-surface reflectance bands and derived vegetation indices optimized for low cover conditions. Our results show that the independent ground sampling data were significantly correlated with remotely sensed estimates. In addition to providing measures of carbon sequestration to the community, these predictive models offer decision makers and rangeland managers the ability to accurately monitor grassland dynamics, control livestock stocking rates in these remote and extensive grasslands.",

            "abstract": "The characterization and remediation of contaminated sites are complex endeavors fraught with numerous challenges. One particular challenge that is receiving increased attention is the development and encouragement of full participation by communities and community members affected by a given site in all facets of decision-making. Many disciplines have been grappling with the challenges associated with environmental and risk communication, public participation in environmental data generation and decision-making, and increasing community capacity. The concepts and methods developed by these disciplines are reviewed, with a focus on their relevance to the specific dynamics associated with contaminated sites. The contributions of these disciplines are then synthesized and integrated to help develop Environmental Research Translation (ERT), a proposed framework for environmental scientists to promote interaction and communication among involved parties at contaminated sites. This holistic approach is rooted in public participation approaches to science, which includes: a transdisciplinary team, effective collaboration, information transfer, public participation in environmental projects, and a cultural model of risk communication. Although there are challenges associated with the implementation of ERT, it is anticipated that application of this proposed translational science method could promote more robust community participation at contaminated sites.",

            "abstract": "The diminishing quantities of non-renewable forms of energy have caused an increasing interest in the renewable sources of energy, such as biofuel, in the recent years. However, the demand for biofuel has created a concern for allocating grain between the fuel and food industry. Consequently, appropriate regulations that limit grain based ethanol production have been developed and are put to practice, which resulted in cultivating perennial grasses like Switch grass and Miscanthus to meet the additional cellulose demand. A change in cropping and management practice, therefore, is essential to cater the conflicting requirement for food and biofuel, which has a long-term impact on the downstream water quality. Therefore it is essential to implement optimal cropping practices to reduce the pollutant loadings. Simulation models in conjunction with optimization procedures are useful in developing efficient cropping practices in such situations. One such model is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which can simulate both the water and the nutrient cycle, as well as quantify long-term impacts of changes in management practice in the watershed. It is envisaged that the SWAT model, along with an optimization algorithm, can be used to identify the optimal cropping pattern that achieves the minimum guaranteed grain production with less downstream pollution, while maximizing the biomass production for biofuel generation. However, the SWAT simulations do have a certain level of uncertainty that needs to be accounted for before making decisions. Therefore, the objectives of this study are twofold: (i) to understand how model uncertainties influence decision-making, and (ii) to develop appropriate management scenarios that account the uncertainty. The simulation uncertainty of the SWAT model is assessed using Shuffled Complex Evolutionary Metropolis Algorithm (SCEM). With the data collected from St. Joseph basin, IN, USA, the preliminary results indicate that model uncertainties do influence the decision-making. The end objective of this study is to quantify a confidence level for the model simulations, which can be used for taking informed decisions on crop management practices.",

Data collection, archiving and analysis from future remote sensing missions, be it from earth science satellites, planetary robotic missions, or massive radio observatories may not scale as more capable instruments stress existing architectural approaches and systems due to more continuous data streams, data from multiple observational platforms, and measurements and models from different agencies. A new paradigm is needed in order to increase the productivity and effectiveness of scientific data analysis. This paradigm must recognize that architectural choices, data processing, management, analysis, etc are interrelated, and must be carefully coordinated in any system that aims to allow efficient, interactive scientific exploration and discovery to exploit massive data collections. Future observational systems, including satellite and airborne experiments, and research in climate modeling will significantly increase the size of the data requiring new methodological approaches towards data analytics where users can more effectively interact with the data and apply automated mechanisms for data reduction, reduction and fusion across these massive data repositories.\nThis presentation will discuss architecture, use cases, and approaches for developing a big data analytics strategy across multiple science disciplines.",

            "abstract": "pH is a critical aerosol property that impacts many atmospheric processes, including biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation, gas-particle phase partitioning, and mineral dust or redox metal mobilization. Particle pH has also been linked to adverse health effects. Using a comprehensive data set from the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) as the basis for thermodynamic modeling, we have shown that particles are currently highly acidic in the southeastern US, with pH between 0 and 2. Sulfate and ammonium are the main acid-base components that determine particle pH in this region, however they have different sources and their concentrations are changing. Over 15 years of network data show that sulfur dioxide emission reductions have resulted in a roughly 70 percent decrease in sulfate, whereas ammonia emissions, mainly link to agricultural activities, have been largely steady, as have gas phase ammonia concentrations. This has led to the view that particles are becoming more neutralized. However, sensitivity analysis, based on thermodynamic modeling, to changing sulfate concentrations indicates that particles have remained highly acidic over the past decade, despite the large reductions in sulfate. Furthermore, anticipated continued reductions of sulfate and relatively constant ammonia emissions into the future will not significantly change particle pH until sulfate drops to clean continental background levels. The result reshapes our expectation of future particle pH and implies that atmospheric processes and adverse health effects linked to particle acidity will remain unchanged for some time into the future.",

Cities in India, China, and even the United States frequently exceed air quality standards. The use of localized data is a powerful enhancement to regulatory monitoring site data. Learning about air quality at a local level is a powerful driver for change.\nThe Kids Making Sense program unites Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education with a complete measurement and environmental education system that teaches youth about air pollution and empowers them to drive positive change in their communities. With this program, youth learn about particle pollution, its sources, and health effects. A half-day lecture is followed by hands-on activity using handheld air sensors paired with an app on smartphones. Students make measurements around schools to discover pollution sources and cleaner areas. Next, the data they collect are crowdsourced on a website for guided discussion and data interpretation.\nThis program meets Next Generation Science Standards, encourages project-based learning and deep understanding of applied science, and allows students to practice science like real scientists. The program has been successfully implemented in several schools in the United States and Asia, including New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Sacramento in the United States, and Taipei and Taichung in Taiwan. During this talk, we’ll provide an overview of the program, discuss some of the challenges, and lay out the next steps for Kids Making Sense.",

            "abstract": "Constructing 3D Earth models through the joint inversion of large geophysical data sets presents numerous theoretical and practical challenges, especially when diverse types of data and model parameters are involved. Among the challenges are the computational complexity associated with large data and model vectors and the need to unify differing model parameterizations, forward modeling methods and regularization schemes within a common inversion framework. The challenges can be addressed in part by decomposing the inverse problem into smaller, simpler inverse problems that can be solved separately, providing one knows how to merge the separate inversion results into an optimal solution of the full problem.\nWe have formulated an approach to the decomposition of large inverse problems based on the augmented Lagrangian technique from optimization theory. As commonly done, we define a solution to the full inverse problem as the Earth model minimizing an objective function motivated, for example, by a Bayesian inference formulation. Our decomposition approach recasts the minimization problem equivalently as the minimization of component objective functions, corresponding to specified data subsets, subject to the constraints that the minimizing models be equal. A standard optimization algorithm solves the resulting constrained minimization problems by alternating between the separate solution of the component problems and the updating of Lagrange multipliers that serve to steer the individual solution models toward a common model solving the full problem.\nWe are applying our inversion method to the reconstruction of the·crust and upper-mantle seismic velocity structure across Eurasia.· Data for the inversion comprise a large set of P and S body-wave travel times·and fundamental and first-higher mode Rayleigh-wave group velocities.",

            "abstract": "Theoretic studies have suggested that electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can cause significant precipitation of ~MeV electrons, supposedly accounting for the fast dropouts of outer-belt electrons during storm main phases. Usually the resonance between left-hand polarized EMIC with electrons with moderate energy is unlikely due to their opposite polarizations, while resonance with highly relativistic electrons do occur and cause electrons to precipitate into the atmosphere through pitch-angle scattering. Several previous studies on observations find a close relation between the two phenomena, e.g., Cliverd et al. [2007], Sandanger et al. [2007], and Miyoshi et al. [2008], while others find otherwise, e.g., Meredith et al. [2011]; recently, more observational evidence supporting the connection has been reported (e.g., Li et al. [2014] and Blum et al. [2015]). However, whether and under what favoring conditions EMIC waves cause rapid dropouts of relativistic electrons during storm main phases remain unresolved questions. Here, using latest wave and electron data from multiple missions including Van Allen Probes, BARREL, and NOAA POES, we systemically examine the relation between EMIC waves and MeV electron precipitation. We first construct two independent event lists for intensified EMIC waves and enhancements of MeV electron precipitation, respectively. Then we cross check the two lists to identify if any significant correlation exists in between, and further characterize the wave effectiveness in terms of L-shell, MLT, resonance energy, as well as the background plasma conditions. Results from this study will advance our knowledge about the loss mechanism of outer-belt electrons, thus laying down another stepping stone towards high-fidelity physics-based models for radiation belts.",

Hydrothermal alteration in these regions, including clay formation, can turn them into low-permeability barriers to fluid flow, which could increase pore fluid pressures resulting in flank slope instability.\nWe examined elevated pore pressure conditions using numerical models of hydrothermal flow in stratovolcanoes, informed by geophysical data about internal structures and deposits. Idealized radially symmetric meshes were developed based on cross-sectional profiles and alteration/permeability structures of Cascade Range stratovolcanoes. We used the OpenGeoSys model to simulate variably saturated conditions in volcanoes heated only by regional heat fluxes, as well as 650°C intrusions at two km depth below the surface. Meteoric recharge was estimated from precipitation rates in the Cascade Range.\nPreliminary results indicate zones of elevated pore pressures form: 1) where slopes are underlain by continuous low-permeability altered layers, or 2) when the edifice has an altered core with saturated, less permeable limbs. The first scenario might control shallow collapses on the slopes above the altered layers. The second could promote deeper flank collapses that are initially limited to the summit and upper slopes, but could progress to the core of an edifice. In both scenarios, pore pressures can be further elevated by shallow intrusions, or evolve over longer time scales under forcing from regional heat flux. Geometries without confining low-permeability layers do not show these pressure effects. Our initial scenarios use radially symmetric models, but we are also simulating hydrothermal flow under real 3D geometries with asymmetric subsurface structures (Mount Adams). Simulation results will be used to inform 3D slope-stability models.",

            "abstract": "Particulate transport at cape-related shoals is generally driven by water circulation that is derived from interactions among tides, waves, and wind. At inner-shelves with alongshore uniform slopes, it has been shown that gravity waves produce offshore-directed transport by means of infragravity (IG) motions. However, the influence of IG waves on the spatial and temporal patterns of particulate transport is not yet understood at cape-related shoals (i.e. inner-shelves characterized by non-uniform bathymetry). To analyze the connection between IG waves and tides, cross-spectral and cross-wavelet analyses were performed on time series data of current profiles and pressure that were measured at both sides of a shoal (east swale and west swale) near Cape Canaveral, Florida. Overall, IG wave heights were coherent with water levels at ~2 cycles/day with a 95% statistical confidence at both locations. However, the coherence at the west swale (closer to shore) was lower than at the east swale. High coherence squared (>0.8) between tidal motions and IG energy could be explained by changes in water depth that produced IG energy losses to sea-swell frequencies during low tide. The 1-m difference in mean depth between east and west locations may explain the difference in coherence as water is not shallow enough at the west swale to produce IG energy losses. This may highlight the sensitivity of IG waves to changes in water depth within this shoal complex. Our results agree with previous studies regarding tidal variability of IG energy in nearshore and inner-shelf environments and could be applied to improve understanding of the role of complicated bathymetry in particulate transport at cape-associated shoals.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the complexity and fidelity of hydrological models is challenging to investigate in a systematic way using current modeling frameworks. Its characterization has so far principally relied on the comparison of different models or of different modules within the same model. Shortcomings of these approaches include the difficulty to pinpoint model features that contribute to good simulations, given the small number of models or modeling hypotheses that are usually evaluated. We use the newly-developed Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) to comprehensively and systematically explore modeling alternatives across the continuum of model complexity. We use SUMMA’s flexibility to evaluate the impacts of explicitly representing or lumping physical processes and hydrological landscapes. Starting from conceptual models based on the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE), we progressively increase model complexity and assess corresponding model fidelity. We scrutinize models’ ability to reproduce observed events and the stability of their performance under changing climatic conditions (robustness). We will show preliminary results for catchments in different hydroclimatic regimes simulated using models of varying complexity. As a first step, model complexity will be quantified using computing time and the number of state variables; model robustness will be quantified using differential split-sample tests; and model performance will be quantified using a suite of multivariate and multi-scale diagnostic metrics. With this modeling approach we seek to uncover trade-offs between realism and practicality. A particular aim is to explore to which extent the replacement of conceptual formulations by physically explicit ones improves model performance, and whether this may lead to a reduction of uncertainty in hydrological simulations.",

            "abstract": "The rough response to a smooth parameter change of some non-chaotic climate models, such as the warm to snowball-Earth transition in energy balance models due to the ice-albedo feedback, can be studied in the framework of bifurcation theory, in particular by analysing the Lyapunov spectrum of fixed points or periodic orbits. However, bifurcation theory is of little help to study the destruction of a chaotic attractor which can occur in high-dimensional General Circulation Models (GCM). Yet, one would expect critical slowing down to occur before the crisis, since, as the system becomes susceptible to the physical instability mechanism responsible for the crisis, it turns out to be less and less resilient to exogenous perturbations and to spontaneous fluctuations due to other types of instabilities on the attractor.\nThe statistical physics framework, extended to nonequilibrium systems, is particularly well suited for the study of global properties of chaotic and stochastic systems. In particular, the semigroup of transfer operators governs the evolution of distributions in phase space and its spectrum characterises both the relaxation rate of distributions to a statistical steady-state and the stability of this steady-state to perturbations. If critical slowing down indeed occurs in the approach to an attractor crisis, the gap in the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators is expected to shrink.\nWe show that the chaotic attractor crisis due to the ice-albedo feedback and resulting in a transition from a warm to a snowball-Earth in the Planet Simulator (PlaSim), a GCM of intermediate complexity, is associated with critical slowing down, as observed by the slower decay of correlations before the crisis (cf. left panel). In addition, we demonstrate that this critical slowing down can be traced back to the shrinkage of the gap between the leading eigenvalues of coarse-grained approximations of the transfer operators and that these eigenvalues capture the fundamental features of the attractor crisis (cf. right panel). Finally, that the spectral gap is small close to the crisis suggests that the linear concept of Climate Sensitivity may be applied only far from an attractor crisis.",

The North Awash Basin contains abundant early hominin fossils and the lakebeds of the Hadar Formation (~3.6 to ~2.9 Ma) will provide a record of climate variability during the Pliocene, prior to the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at ~2.7 Ma. The lakebeds of the Turkana Basin are Early Pleistocene in age (~1.9 to ~1.45 Ma) and span the interval that includes some the earliest fossils of Homo rudolfensis and H. ergaster/erectus. Here we examine the organic geochemistry of West Turkana and North Awash Basin sediments and investigate the use of proxies based on isoprenoid and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) to reconstruct temperature, including TEX86 and the methylation and cyclization (MBT and CBT) ratios and relative abundances of branched GDGTs.

            "abstract": "Irrigation is widely adopted as a measure to maintain crop yield when precipitation is limited and stabilize crop yield to buffer climatic fluctuation. Irrigation has considerably interfered with hydrological processes in many areas with extensive and intensive irrigation requirement; with the increasing demand for food and weather variability related to climate change, irrigation application is expected to increase, which would aggravate the interferences to hydrologic processes. Current studies focus on the impact of irrigation on the mean value of ET at either local or regional scale, however, how irrigation changes the variability of ET has not been well understood. This study analyzes the impact of extensive irrigation on ET variability in the High Plains. We apply an ET variance decomposition framework (Zeng and Cai 2015) to quantify the effects of both climate and irrigation on ET variance in in the High Plains watersheds. Based on climatic and groundwater storage data, we assess the monthly ET variance and its components for both pre-development (1930s-1960s) and development periods (1970-2010s). It is found that irrigation not only causes the well-known groundwater drawdown and stream depletion problems in the area associated with, but also changes ET variance, which further affects land surface processes. With complementary water supply from irrigation, ET approaches to potential ET, and ET variance is more attributed to climatic variables such as temperature, while causing significant seasonal fluctuations to groundwater storage. For sustainable water resources management in the High Plains, we argue that both the mean value and the variance of ET should be considered together for the regulation of irrigation in this region.",

            "abstract": "Characterising seismicity in the vicinity of the Alpine Fault, a major transform boundary late in its typical earthquake cycle, may provide constraints on the state of stress preceding a large earthquake. Here, we use recently detected tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) to examine how slow tectonic deformation is loading the Alpine Fault toward an anticipated major rupture. We work with a continuous seismic dataset collected between 2009 and 2012 from a network of short-period seismometers, the Southern Alps Microearthquake Borehole Array (SAMBA). Fourteen primary LFE templates have been used to scan the dataset using a matched-filter technique based on an iterative cross-correlation routine. This method allows the detection of similar signals and establishes LFE families with common hypocenter locations. The detections are then combined for each LFE family using phase-weighted stacking (Thurber et al., 2014) to produce a signal with the highest possible signal to noise ratio. We find this method to be successful in increasing the number of LFE detections by roughly 10% in comparison with linear stacking. Our next step is to manually pick polarities on first arrivals of the phase-weighted stacked signals and compute preliminary locations. We are working to estimate LFE focal mechanism parameters and refine the focal mechanism solutions using an amplitude ratio technique applied to the linear stacks. LFE focal mechanisms should provide new insight into the geometry and rheology of the Alpine Fault and the stress field prevailing in the central Southern Alps.",

Among them are those by NOAA, the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), and the US Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The projected magnitudes of SLR from some of these sources are being used by policymakers to make difficult choices of investments on infrastructure that can be resilient against anticipated SLR. While there is no question that SLR will happen and resilience measures against SLR is very necessary, this presentation questions the rigor of science behind some of these projections that can have significant costs to the society. A critical assessment of available SLR projections for the northeast US and their discrepancies is presented. It is concluded from the current understanding of science that the mean values and upper bounds of SLR from NOAA, NPCC and COE are likely exaggerated for the region. It is also argued that scientists should treat the SLR projection as a separate problem from policies so that the best cost-benefit analysis can be performed in the decision process.",

Nevertheless, the role of black carbon particles and especially their complex interaction with clouds needs further research which is hampered by the limited experimental data, especially observations in the free troposphere, and in the UTLS (upper troposphere and lower stratosphere).\nIn August 2014, a single particle soot photometer (SP2) was included in the extensive scientific payload of the CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) project. CARIBIC is in operation since 1997 and carries out systematic observations of trace gas and aerosol sampling and on-line analyses, as well as DOAS remote sensing system at 10-12 km altitude. For this a special air freight container combining different instruments is transported on a monthly basis using a Lufthansa Airbus A340-600 passenger aircraft with destinations from 120°W to 120°E and 10°N to 75°N. The integration of a SP2 offers the possibility for the first long-term measurement of global distribution of black carbon.\nUp to date the SP2 measurements have been analyzed for 392 flights hours over four continents (Fig. 1). The first measurements show promising results of black carbon including periods when background concentrations in the UTLS were encountered. Beside a general distribution of number and mass of black carbon particles, peak events were detected with up to 20 times higher concentrations compared to the background. Moreover, high concentration plumes have been observed continuously over a range of 10,000 km. Interestingly, our results show also a generally lower amount of black carbon mass in the tropics compared to the mid latitude northern hemisphere.",

Previous studies indicate that regional climate models better reproduce extreme precipitation with their higher spatial resolution than coarser resolution global climate models. This study utilized radar-based hourly precipitation data with a resolution of 4 km to evaluate rainfall characteristics simulated with NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model at horizontal resolutions of 24, 12 and 4 km. We also examined the impact of spectral nudging on the performance of NU-WRF. The rainfall characteristics in the observations and simulations were defined as a joint probability distribution function (JPDF) between duration and peak intensity of precipitation events over the Great Plains in summer. The Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) is an open source software suite developed jointly by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California, Los Angeles. RCMES facilitates evaluation of NU-WRF evaluations by providing tools to process a vast amount of observational and model datasets with high resolutions. Using RCMES, we calculated JPDF for each dataset and the overlapping area between observed and simulated JPDFs to measure the similarity between the two JPDFs. The performance of NU-WRF simulations based on the precipitation JPDF is strongly dependent on their resolutions. The simulation with the highest resolution of 4 km shows the best agreement with the observations with the same resolution in simulating short-duration downpour events over the Great Plains. Our analysis indicates that even the regridded high-resolution simulation on low-resolution grids shows better performance than low-resolution simulations. The simulations with lower resolutions of 12 and 24 km show reasonable agreement only with the observational data whose resolutions are similar to the simulations.",

            "abstract": "Trace-gas eddy covariance flux measurement can be made with open-path or closed-path analyzers. Traditional closed-path trace-gas analyzers use multipass absorption cells that behave as mixing volumes, requiring high sample flow rates to achieve useful frequency response. The high sample flow rate and the need to keep the multipass cell extremely clean dictates the use of a fine-pore filter that may clog quickly. A large-capacity filter cannot be used because it would degrade the EC system frequency response. The high flow rate also requires a powerful vacuum pump, which will typically consume on the order of 1000 W. The analyzer must measure water vapor for spectroscopic and dilution corrections. Open-path analyzers are available for methane, but not for nitrous oxide. The currently available methane analyzers have low power consumption, but are very large. Their large size degrades frequency response and disturbs the air flow near the sonic anemometer. They require significant maintenance to keep the exposed multipass optical surfaces clean. Water vapor measurements for dilution and spectroscopic corrections require a separate water vapor analyzer.\nA new closed-path eddy covariance system for measuring nitrous oxide or methane fluxes provides an elegant solution. The analyzer (TGA200A, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) uses a thermoelectrically-cooled interband cascade laser. Its small sample-cell volume and unique sample-cell configuration (200 ml, 1.5 m single pass) provide excellent frequency response with a low-power scroll pump (240 W). A new single-tube Nafion® dryer removes most of the water vapor, and attenuates fluctuations in the residual water vapor. Finally, a vortex intake assembly eliminates the need for an intake filter without adding volume that would degrade system frequency response. Laboratory testing shows the system attenuates the water vapor dilution term by more than 99% and achieves a half-power band width of 3.5 Hz.",

            "abstract": "Fire-triggered thunderstorms, known as pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb), can alter fire behavior, influence smoke plume trajectory, and hinder fire suppression efforts. Intense pyroCb can also inject a significant quantity of aerosol mass into the lower stratosphere. Systematic detection and monitoring of these events is important for wildfire response and aviation applications, as well as understanding climate and air quality implications. The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) recently developed a near-real-time pyroCb detection algorithm using geostationary satellite observations, currently focused on GOES-West. The algorithm is tuned to the microphysics of fire-perturbed thunderstorms over elevated terrain in western North America. By incorporating reanalysis data, NRL has also developed the first observationally-based conceptual model for pyroCb development. Results are focused on 41 large wildfires observed in the United States and Canada during 2013, which produced more than 50 intense pyroCb. The majority of these develop when a layer of increased moisture content and instability is advected over a dry, deep, and unstable mixed layer, typically along the leading edge of an approaching disturbance. The upper-tropospheric dynamics and synoptic pattern must also be conducive for vertical development of convection. Mid- and upper-tropospheric conditions similar to those that produce traditional dry thunderstorms are therefore paramount for development and maintenance of pyroCb. The amount of mid-level moisture and instability required is strongly dependent on the surface elevation of the contributing fire. Surface-based fire weather indices have limited capability for predicting pyroCb development. The intense radiant heat emitted by large wildfires can serve as a potential trigger, suggesting pyroCb may develop in the absence of traditional triggering mechanisms when an otherwise favorable meteorological environment is in place. This conceptual model suggests that pyroCb, traditionally considered a niche phenomenon, are in fact a significant and endemic feature of the regional summer climate. Results of this work will improve our ability to detect, monitor, and predict pyroCb, providing increased understanding of this phenomenon’s role in the climate system.",

            "abstract": "During the late Miocene, a small change in the relative motion of the Pacific plate resulted in compressive as well as translational deformation along the central San Andreas Fault (SAF), creating thrust faults and folds throughout this region of California. We constructed a 3D model of an upper crustal volume between Pinnacles National Park and Gold Hill by assembling geologic map data and cross sections, geophysical data, and petroleum well logs in MoveTm, software which has the ability to forward and reverse model movement along faults and folds. For this study, we chose a blind thrust fault west of the SAF near Parkfield to compare deformation produced by MoveTm’s forward modeling algorithm with that observed. We chose various synclines east of the SAF to explore the software’s ability to unfold (reverse model) units. For the initial round of modeling, strike-slip movement has been omitted as the fault algorithm was designed primarily for extensional or compressional environments.\nPreliminary forward modeling of originally undeformed strata along the blind thrust produced geometries similar to those in the present-day 3D geologic model. The modeled amount of folding produced in hanging wall strata was less severe, suggesting these units were slightly folded before displacement. Based on these results, the algorithm shows potential in predicting deformation related to blind thrusts.\nContraction in the region varies with fold axis location and orientation. MoveTm’s unfolding algorithm can allow researchers to measure the amount of contraction a fold represents, and compare that amount across the modeled area as a way of observing regional stress patterns. The unfolding algorithm also allows for passive deformation of strata unconformably underlying the fold; one example reveals a steeper orientation of Cretaceous units prior to late Miocene deformation. Such modeling capabilities can allow for a better understanding of the structural history of the region.",

Moreover, the ion temperatures observed by DMSP satellites (F16, F17 and F19) at magnetic latitudes greater than 80° are higher than those in the auroral oval, and the their averaged increases are 316K in the northern hemisphere and 248 K in the southern hemisphere, respectively. In addition, the neutral density residuals measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite indicate the largest values at the highest orbital latitudes.

Efficient and easily adaptable numerical treatments are needed that can predict flow paths and dominant behaviors to illuminate the underlying mechanisms without the obscuring influence of secondary effects. We implement depth-averaged finite element models in COMSOL that treat a given lava flow as a non-isothermal gravity current overlain by a growing surface crust. For model validation we use observations from analog experiments that use both isothermal and rapidly cooling fluids to simulate the interactions of lava flows with topographic obstacles. Under a broad range of relevant conditions, although the flow thickness is very small compared with its extent, the high Péclet number ensures that most of the flow depth remains nearly isothermal, with crust forming in a thermal boundary layer near the surface. This surface crust can exert a retarding force that limits flow extent and leads to thickening. The good agreement between model predictions and laboratory experiments provides confidence in the extensibility of our simulation strategy to ongoing efforts at examining additional flow processes, including flow stagnation and channelization.",

            "abstract": "The desert grasslands of the southwestern U.S. have undergone extensive woody shrub encroachment over the last 150 years. Although this process has been initiated and reinforced by a number of mechanisms, their relative importance has rarely been studied. The U.S. portion of the Chihuahuan Desert provides different stages of shrub encroachment from the south (middle-late) to the north (early), along with an intensity gradient for many biophysical processes including wind and fire. The objective of this study is to synthesize our recent studies in the south (Jornada LTER) and in the north (Sevilleta LTER), and to investigate the relative importance of abiotic factors, in particular wind and fire, in relating to the ecosystem dynamics in the Chihuahuan Desert. Our results demonstrated that aeolian processes play a vital role in the formation and reinforcement of shrub islands and associated soil resources heterogeneity in Jornada, whereas in Sevilleta, wind is deeply involved in the ecosystem dynamics only when the surface is disturbed, such as by fire. In the south (Jornada), the removal of grasses has resulted in a quick expansion of shrub islands owing to the increase in the distribution of sediments from grass interspaces. While in the north (Sevilleta), shrub islands have diminished and numerous small grass islands were formed after the removal of shrubs by fire. Collectively, we found that the soil resource islands are dynamic (e.g., can be destroyed and reformed) in Sevilleta due to the presence of fires while at Jornada they are static but continuously reinforced as fires are absent and the intensity of wind is strong.",

These salt-bearing minerals would potentially be source material for dust lofted from the surface into the Martian atmosphere, thus providing potential nucleation sites for water ice clouds. Considering that salts play an important role in cloud formation on Earth, it is important to have a better understanding of how salt may affect nucleation processes under Mars-like conditions. We perform laboratory experiments to examine water ice nucleation onto salt substrates. We use a vacuum chamber that simulates the temperatures and pressures observed of the Martian atmosphere. Using infrared spectroscopy we measure the onset of nucleation and calculate the temperature-dependent critical saturation ratio (Scrit) for water ice nucleation onto salts, specifically sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate. Preliminary results of Scrit values for water ice nucleation on sodium chloride show a negative temperature dependence, as did other substrates from previous experiments. Values of Scrit are useful for understanding the realistic conditions under which water ice clouds may form on Mars, and can be used in climate models simulating clouds on Mars.",

In this paper we present high spatio-temporal imagery of equatorial plasma bubbles\n(EPBs) from an imaging system called the Large Aperture Ionospheric Structure Imager\n(LAISI), which was specifically designed to capture short-integration, high-resolution images of\nF-region recombination airglow at λ557.7 nm. The imager features 8-inch diameter entrance\noptics comprised of a unique F/0.87 lens, combined with a monolithic 8-inch diameter\ninterference filter and a 2x2-inch CCD detector. The LAISI field of view is approximately 30\ndegrees.\nFiltered all-sky images at common airglow wavelengths are combined with magnetic\nfield-aligned LAISI images, GNSS scintillation, and VHF scintillation data obtained at\nAscension Island (7.98S, 14.41W geographic). A custom-built, multi-constellation GNSS data\ncollection system was employed that sampled GPS L1, L2C, L5, GLONASS L1 and L2, Beidou\nB1, and Galileo E1 and E5a signals. Sophisticated processing software was able to maintain\nlock of all signals during strong scintillation, providing unprecedented spatial observability of\nL band scintillation.\nThe smallest-resolvable scale sizes above the noise floor in the EPBs, as viewed by\nLAISI, are illustrated for integration times of 1, 5 and 10 seconds, with concurrent\nzonal irregularity drift speeds from both spaced-receiver VHF measurements and single-station\nGNSS measurements of S4 and σφ.

The Sn phase is often a difficult phase to identify for continental paths since it usually has a relatively small amplitude compared to the regional phase Lg. Also Sn is often a high frequency phase and thus it is often blocked for paths that cross tectonically active regions. We have used the unprecedented amount of national network and temporary stations that were deployed across China over the last five years to be able to successfully identify Sn phases and use them to measure Sn Q using a reverse two station method. The initial waveforms was filtered with the frequency band of 0.5-3 Hz, and Sn time window was computed using velocities range of 4.3-4.7 km/s. Sn waveforms from 43 earthquakes recorded by 63 stations were manually picked out in order to obtain the ratio of Sn amplitude from each two-station pair. Those ratios describe Sn attenuation along each inter-station path. We have used to approaches: the two-station method was used to isolate factors, such as source, and earth response, and calculate inter-station Q value. And LSQR algorithm was used to obtain tomographically map lateral variations in Sn Q.\nWe find relatively low uppermost mantle Q anomaly is consistent with the Weihe graben, a young active rifting system with hot uppermantle. Low Q value also appears in the southern part of the Ordos plateau, which shows the opposite result to the characteristics of lithospheric mantle in a craton. This may be a result of scattering attenuation of Sn or possible thermal erosion of the lithospheric root beneath the southern Ordos.",

            "abstract": "The complex hydrologic regimes of karst aquifers respond rapidly to the effects of climate change, and unique biological communities associated with karst are sensitive to hydrologic changes. To explore how climate change might affect karst-dependent species, we coupled a climate-change model, a hydrologic model, and a vulnerability assessment tool to evaluate projected hydrologic change and vulnerability of selected species at sites in the karstic Edwards aquifer (Texas) and Madison aquifer (South Dakota). The Advanced Research Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate projected climate from 2011 to 2050 at a 36-km grid spacing for 3 weather stations near the study sites. Daily climate projections from the WRF model were used as input for the hydrologic Rainfall-Response Aquifer and Watershed Flow (RRAWFLOW) model and the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI). RRAWFLOW is a lumped-parameter model that simulates hydrologic response at a single site, superposing the quick- and slow-flow responses that commonly characterize karst aquifers. CCVI uses historical and projected climate and hydrologic metrics to assess the vulnerability of a species. An upward trend in temperature was projected at all three weather stations; there was a trend (downward) in precipitation only for the Texas weather station. A downward trend in mean annual spring flow or groundwater level was projected for the three Edwards sites, but there was no significant trend for the two Madison sites. Of 16 Edwards aquifer species evaluated, 10 were scored as highly or moderately vulnerable under the projected climate change scenario. In contrast, all 8 Madison aquifer species evaluated were scored as moderately vulnerable, stable, or intermediate between the two. The inclusion of hydrologic projections in the vulnerability assessment was essential for interpreting the effects of climate change on aquatic species of conservation concern such as endemic salamanders.",

            "abstract": "As one reviewer said about John McPhee's Encounters With the Archdruid:\"So the real issues relate to what is natural? How should lands be used? What role do humans have in using, caring for, being part of the land and can we do so responsibly?\" This quote applies equally to more than just land development -- it applies to water project too.\nAlthough Marc Reisner wrote Cadillac Desert in 1986, the lessons it presents about water development are current today. Not much has changed really in the past three decades. People still live in arid places where, perhaps, they should not live. Engineers still redesign nature to meet human needs, only to find out later that there are unintended consequences. About the only thing that has changed is that today the Bureau of Reclamation and other agencies do not spend megabucks to construct huge water projects. And, insignificant by comparison, some restoration and dam removal projects have begun on a limited scale.\nWe developed an exercise, based on selected chapters from Reisner’s book and a video derived from the book, to help students develop critical thinking and ethical reasoning skills. As we did so, we realized that there was much more that could be included. The ethical dilemmas associated with water development and related engineering projects are many. So, now, the original exercise has been expanded to 7 units.\nThe original five units are based on Cadillac Desert. The sixth is based on a recent great documentary film, DamNation. The last unit is inspired by a terrific chapter from John McPhee’s 1971 book Encounters with the Archdruid. The format is that student read articles and book chapters and then write responses to questions designed to get them to reflect on what they read. So, the exercises may be assigned as homework, but for the most value there must be some significant group discussions. If all units are used, this provides several weeks of homework for students, but instructors may cherry pick the units they wish to use. They pretty much stand alone – except that the last two tie everything together and call for more thought by the students.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic cycle intensification is a key dimension of climate change, with significant impacts on human and natural systems. A basic measure of hydrologic cycle intensification, the increase in global-mean precipitation per unit surface warming, varies by a factor of three in current-generation climate models (~1-3 % K-1). We show that a substantial portion of this spread can be traced to intermodel variations in the atmospheric shortwave absorption response to greenhouse-gas-induced warming. As climate warms, increases in shortwave absorption suppress the precipitation increase by reducing the latent heating required to balance the atmospheric energy budget. Spread in the shortwave absorption response can be explained by differences in the sensitivity of solar absorption to variations in column precipitable water. An observational estimate suggests that in many models, this sensitivity is too small, and that the shortwave absorption response to warming is too weak. Spread in the simulated sensitivity of solar absorption to varying water vapor concentration is linked to differences in radiative transfer parameterizations. Attaining accurate shortwave absorption responses through radiative transfer scheme improvement could reduce spread in global precipitation increase per unit warming at the end of the 21st century by ~35%, and produce an ensemble-mean increase that is almost 40% smaller.",

            "abstract": "The devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake showed the need to be more vigilant toward mitigation for future earthquakes in the region. Previous studies have shown that this earthquake did not occur on the Enriquillo Fault, the main plate boundary fault running through the heavily populated Port-au-Prince region, but on the nearby and previously unknown Léogâne transpressional fault. Slip on that fault has increased stresses on the Enriquillo Fault mostly in the region closer to Port-au-Prince, the most populated city of the country. Here we investigate the ground shaking level in this region if a rupture similar to the Mw 7.0 2010 Haiti earthquake occurred on the Enriquillo fault. We use a finite element method and assumptions on regional stress to simulate low frequency dynamic rupture propagation for a 53 km long segment. We introduce some heterogeneity by creating two slip patches with shear traction 10% greater than the initial shear traction on the fault. The final slip distribution is similar in distribution and magnitude to previous finite fault inversions for the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The high-frequency ground motion components are calculated using the specific barrier model, and the hybrid synthetics are obtained by combining the low-frequencies (f < 1Hz) from the dynamic rupture simulation with the high-frequencies (f > 1Hz) from the stochastic simulation using matched filtering at a crossover frequency of 1 Hz. The average horizontal peak ground acceleration, computed at several sites of interest through Port-au-Prince, has a value of 0.35g. We also compute response spectra at those sites and compare them to the spectra from the microzonation study.",

            "abstract": "The isoelectronic analogs xenon and CsI (i.e. having the same, noble-gas electronic configuration) both undergo a fundamental change in chemical bonding under pressure, becoming metallic by 135 (±20) GPa, the pressure at Earth’s core–mantle boundary. Using Brillouin spectroscopy and diamond-anvil cells to 19 GPa at 290 K, we find that the electronic polarizability of CsI increases with pressure, quantifying the delocalization of electron charge density as the initially ionic salt is compressed toward the metallic state. Our results show a different trend from a previous measurement of refractive index under pressure and are consistent with the Herzfeld criterion that metallization is achieved when electron polarization is comparable to (or exceeds) inter-atomic distances. Our measurements of longitudinal elastic-wave velocity, VP, are in good accord with prior ultrasonic determinations below 1 GPa but suggest a slightly larger pressure derivative for the average shear modulus than previously thought. This conclusion is based on using Eulerian finite-strain descriptions of the equation of state and elastic moduli under pressure, and assumes that nonhydrostatic effects are unimportant. Our measurements were made on decompression as well as compression, using polycrystalline samples.\nExperimental measurements of changes in electronic and elastic properties under pressure can be used to validate and improve first-principles quantum mechanical calculations of bonding and other material properties, and can characterize the evolution of noble-gas toward chemically bonded systems at conditions deep inside planets.",

            "abstract": "Knowing the upstream solar wind conditions is essential in forecasting the variations in the geomangetic field and the status of the Earth's ionosphere. Most data-driven simulations or data-assimilation codes, used for space weather forecasting, are based on the solar wind measurements at 1 AU, or more specifically at the first Lagrangian orbit (L1), such as observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). However, L1 measurements may not represent the solar wind conditions just outside the magnetosphere. As a result, time-series measurements from L1 by themselves are not adequate to run simulations to derive probabilistic forecasts of the magnetosphere and ionosphere. To obtain confidence levels and uncertainty estimates, a solar wind ensemble data set is desirable. Therefore we used three years of measurements atACE advected using the flat delay method to the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP8) spacecraft location. Then, we compared both measurements to establish Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) functions for IMP8 measurements based on ACE measurements. In addition, we used a 4-categorization scheme to sort the incoming solar wind into ejecta, coronal-hole-origin, sector-reversal-regions, and streamer-belt-origin categories at both ACE and IMP8. We established the KDE functions for each category and compared with the uncategorized KDE functions. The location of the IMP8 spacecraft allows us to use these KDE functions to generate ensemble of solar wind data close to Earth's magnetopause. The ensemble can then be used to forecast the state of the geomagnetic field and the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Presidents Barrack Obama of the United States and Jinping Xi of China recently announced a bilateral framework to reduce the total carbon emissions of their respective countries. The U.S. agreed to reduce annual carbon emissions such that by 2025, emissions would be 27% below 2005 levels. China agreed to achieve peak carbon emissions around 2030 coupled with a best effort to peak early. Here we analyze the implications of the Obama-Xi accord for total global carbon emissions (GCE) out to year 2060, using projections of population, economic growth, and carbon intensity for the rest of the world as well as various assumptions regarding how emissions from the U.S. and China will evolve after the timeframe of the Obama-Xi accord. Our GCE projections will be compared to those of the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The Obama-Xi accord is shown to be a meaningful first step: if followed, the actual GCE will likely fall below RCP 8.5 between now and 2060. The U.S., China, and rest of the world presently emit 4.5, 2.0, and 1.1 tonne of carbon per person per year (tpy), respectively. We show that if the world’s nations adopt a strategy of “Contraction and Convergence”, such that per capita emission for each country reaches 1.0 tpy by 2060, actual GCE will approach that of RCP 4.5 by year 2060. Such action may be needed to reduce the risk of the most dire global warming forecasts within IPCC AR5.",

            "abstract": "In mountain landscapes, vegetation is tightly coupled to elevation through orographic effects on temperature and precipitation. However, at any given elevation, vegetation can vary markedly due to non-climatic factors such as lithology. For example, tree-canopy cover correlates strongly with bedrock composition in the Sierra Nevada, California, via mechanisms that remain poorly understood. We are exploring the hypothesis that vegetation varies across bedrock types in the Sierra Nevada due to differences in near-surface fracture density that influence the availability of water for plants. Our approach uses data collected from autonomous seismic nodes that record seismic energy generated by ambient sources such as wind, rivers, and road traffic. By deploying the nodes across the landscape in arrays spanning 200 m on a side, we can obtain a three-dimensional image of spatial variations in near-surface weathering. Data presented here will be derived from arrays deployed for 3 days each spanning an area of 0.04 km2 at each of three sites underlain by Sierra Nevada granites and granodiorites. To isolate the effects of lithology on vegetation, we chose sites that span a range of forest cover and mafic-mineral content but have similar microclimate (i.e., with similar aspect and elevation). Our data will provide a three-dimensional model of P- and S-wave velocity structure, which we can invert using a Hertz-Mindlin porosity model to constrain the thickness and degree of fracturing and thus the subsurface water-holding potential for plants. We will explore the hypothesis that the densest vegetation occurs within bedrock with the densest fracturing, due to enhanced availability of water in the near surface. We will present a comparison of our results from the Sierra Nevada and results from similar experiments at the Snowy Range and Blair Wallis field sites of the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics.",

            "abstract": "Montmorillonite, an expandable smectite clay, is a common mineral in fault zones to a depth of around 3 km. Its low strength relative to other common fault gouge minerals is important in many models of fault rheology. However, the coefficient of friction is not well constrained in the literature due to the difficulty of establishing fully drained or fully dried states in the laboratory. For instance, in some reported studies, samples were either partially saturated or possibly over pressured, leading to wide variability in reported shear strength. In this study, the coefficient of friction, µ, of both saturated and oven-dried (at 150°C) Na-montmorillonite was measured at normal stresses up to 680 MPa at room temperature and shortening rates from 1.0 to 0.01 µm/s. Care was taken to shear saturated samples slowly enough to avoid pore fluid overpressure in the clay layers. Coefficients of friction are reported after 8 mm of axial displacement in a triaxial apparatus on saw-cut samples containing a layer of montmorillonite gouge, with either granite or sandstone driving blocks. For saturated samples, µ increased from around 0.1 at low pressure to 0.25 at the highest test pressures. In contrast, values for oven-dried samples decreased asymptotically from approximately 0.78 at 10 MPa normal stress to around 0.45 at 400-680 MPa. While wet and dry strengths approached each other with increasing effective normal stress, wet strength remained only about half of the dry strength at 600 MPa effective normal stress. The increased coefficient of friction can be correlated with a reduction in the number of loosely bound lubricating surface water layers on the clay platelets due to applied normal stress under saturated conditions.\nThe steady-state rate dependence of friction, a-b, was positive and dependent on normal stress. For saturated samples, a-b increased linearly with applied normal stress from ~0 to 0.004, while for dry samples a-b decreased with increasing normal stress from 0.008 to 0.002. All values were either neutral or rate strengthening, indicating a tendency for stable sliding.",

            "abstract": "Although petroleum hydrocarbon releases in the subsurface have been well studied, the impacts of subsurface releases of highly degradable alternative fuels, including biodiesel, are not as well understood. One concern is the generation of CH4­ which may lead to explosive conditions in underground structures. In addition, the biodegradation of biodiesel consumes O2 that would otherwise be available for the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons that may be present at a site. Until now, biodiesel biodegradation in the vadose zone has not been examined in detail, despite being critical to understanding the full impact of a release. This research involves a detailed study of a laboratory release of 80 L of biodiesel applied at surface into a large sandtank to examine the progress of biodegradation reactions. The experiment will monitor the onset and temporal evolution of CH4 generation to provide guidance for site monitoring needs following a biodiesel release to the subsurface. Three CO2 and CH4 flux chambers have been deployed for long term monitoring of gas emissions. CO2 fluxes have increased in all chambers over the 126 days since the start of the experiment. The highest CO2 effluxes are found directly above the spill and have increased from < 0.5 µmol m-2 s-1 to ~3.8 µmol m-2 s-1, indicating an increase in microbial activity. There were no measurable CH4 fluxes 126 days into the experiment. Sensors were emplaced to continuously measure O2, CO2, moisture content, matric potential, EC, and temperature. In response to the release, CO2 levels have increased across all sensors, from an average value of 0.1% to 0.6% 126 days after the start of the experiment, indicating the rapid onset of biodegradation. The highest CO2 values observed from samples taken in the gas ports were 2.5%. Average O2 concentrations have decreased from 21% to 17% 126 days after the start of the experiment. O2 levels in the bottom central region of the sandtank declined to approximately 12%.",

We present a comparison of radiocarbon measurements from conventional counts, atomic mass spectrometry and differing peat materials to demonstrate a general compatibility of the various types of dates. We compare and apply several summed probability distribution methods to minimize any statistical bias in our analysis. We then present our analysis of a new data set of 7571 peatland cores from 4420 sites that extend into the temperate zone. Of these, 3732 cores inform on lateral expansion and 329 dates constrain the timing of fen-bog transition. Based on these data in original and gridded form we show that widespread peat initiation commenced at 16 kcal yr BP and reached a maximum rate at 11-8 kcal yr BP. Most sites began as fens, and peak transition to bogs occurred between 5 and 3 kcal yr BP, with a 1000 year lag between Eurasia and North America. There is no global late Holocene increase in lateral expansion. Based on modeled northern peatland area and ratio of fen/bog sites, CH4 production from northern peatlands increased rapidly from 11 to 9 cal yr BP, followed by slower increase until reaching a maximum at 5 kcal yr BP at 25 Tg per yr. From 4 kcal yr BP to Present, bogs become a dominant feature in the northern peatland landscape and CH4 production decreased to reach modern-day levels at about 20 Tg per yr. Northern peatlands have been a key infleunce on global atmospheric methan variations but likely cannot account for the late Holocene increase in atmospheric CH4 experienced after 4 kcal yr BP.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrate is an ice-like solid that can sequester large quantities of methane gas in marine sediments along most continental margins where thermodynamic conditions permit its formation. Along the circum-Arctic shelf, relict permafrost-associated methane hydrate deposits formed when non-glaciated portions of the shelf experienced subaerial exposure during ocean transgressions. Gas hydrate stability and the permeability of circum-Arctic shelf sediments to gas migration is closely linked with relict submarine permafrost. Heat flow observations on the Alaskan North Slope and Canadian Beaufort Shelf suggest the movement of groundwater offshore, but direct observations of groundwater flow do not exist. Submarine discharge, an offshore flow of fresh, terrestrial groundwater, can affect the temperature and salinity field in shelf sediments, and may be an important factor in submarine permafrost and gas hydrate evolution on the Arctic continental shelf. Submarine groundwater discharge may also enhance the transport of organic matter for methanogenesis within marine sediments. Because it is buoyancy-driven, the velocity field contains regions with a vertical (upward) component as groundwater flows offshore. This combination of factors makes submarine groundwater discharge a potential mechanism controlling permafrost-associated gas hydrate evolution on the Arctic continental shelf.\nIn this study, we quantitatively investigate the feasibility of submarine groundwater discharge as a control on permafrost-associated gas hydrate formation on the Arctic continental shelf, using the Canadian Beaufort Shelf as an example. We have developed a shelf-scale, two-dimensional numerical model based on the finite volume method for two-phase flow of pore fluid and methane gas within Arctic shelf sediments. The model tracks the evolution of the pressure, temperature, salinity, methane gas, methane hydrate, and permafrost fields given imposed boundary conditions, with latent heat of water ice and hydrate formation included. The permeability structure of the sediments is coupled to changes in the permafrost and gas hydrate deposits, and the model can be run over several glacial cycles. Model development and preliminary results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The issue of matching measurement scale to application scale is long standing and frequently revisited with advances in instrumentation and computing power. In the past we have emphasized the importance of understanding the dominant processes and amount and nature of parameter variability when addressing these issues. Landscape-scale distribution of carbon and carbon fluxes is a primary focus of the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory (RC CZO). Soil temperature (Ts) is a critical parameter of generally unknown variability. Estimates of Ts are often based on air temperature (Ta), but it is understood that other factors control Ts, especially in complex terrain, where solar radiation may be a major driver. Data were collected at the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), which is 240 km2 in extent and covers a 1000 m elevation range. We used spatially extensive Ts data to evaluate correlations with Ta (915 m elevation gradient) on aspect neutral sites with similar vegetative cover. Effects of complex terrain were evaluated using a combination of fixed point measurements, fiber optic distributed temperature sensing and periodic, spatially distributed point measurements. We found that Ts over the elevation gradient followed Ta closely. However, within small subwatersheds with uniform Ta, Ts may be extremely variable, with a standard deviation of 8° C. This was strongly related to topographically associated land surface units (LSU’s) and highly seasonal. Within LSU variability was generally low while there were seasonally significant differences between LSU’s. The mean annual soil temperature difference between LSU’s was greater than that associated with the 915 m elevation gradient. The seasonality of Ts variability was not directly related to solar radiation effects but rather to variations in cover. Scaling Ts requires high resolution accounting of topography in this environment. Spatial patterns of soil carbon at the RCEW are consistent with this.",

            "abstract": "Jin and Dickinson (2010) identify three reasons why LST has not been adopted as a climate variable. Paraphrasing the authors, the three roadblocks for use of satellite LST products in climate studies are; \n1) unknown accuracy (What are surface emissivity and atmospheric correction uncertainties?)\n2) spatial scale ambiguity (Are satellite footprints too large to be physically meaningful?)\n3) lack of consistency over decadal time scales (How far backward/forward can we go in time?).\nThese issues apply particularly to the cryosphere where the lack of surface measurement sites make the proper use of satellite observations critical for monitoring climate change. This paper will address each of these three issues but with a focus on the high and dry Greenland and Antarctic plateaus and the contrast in trends between the two. Recent comparisons of MODIS LST products with AIRS version 6 LST products show large differences over Greenland (Lee et al. 2014). In this paper we take the logical next step of creating a bottoms up uncertainty budget for a new synergistic AIRS/MODIS LST product for ice and snow conditions. This new product will address the issue of unknown accuracy by providing a local LST uncertainty along with each estimate of surface temperature. The combination of the high spatial resolution of the MODIS and the high spectral resolution of the AIRS observations of radiance allow the combination of the two sensors to provide information with lower uncertainty than what is possible from the current separate operational products. The issue of surface emissivity and atmospheric correction uncertainties will be addressed explicitly using spectrally resolved models that cover the infrared region. The issue of spatial scale ambiguity is overcome by creating a classification of the results based on the spatial homogenity of surface temperatures. The issue of lack of consistency over long time scales is addressed by demonstrating an algorithm using collocated NASA MODIS and AIRS radiance that can be applied forward in time with the VIIRS and CrIS sensors on the SNPP and JPSS platforms. In principle this will provide a 30+ year historical record of LST at Greenland and Antarctica all with a consistent data processing algorithm and uncertainty estimates which can be used to characterize climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotelluric Transfer Functions (MT TFs) represent most of the information about Earth electrical conductivity found in the raw electromagnetic data, providing inputs for further inversion and interpretation. To be useful for scientific interpretation, they must also contain carefully recorded metadata. Making these data available in a discoverable and citable fashion would provide the most benefit to the scientific community, but such a development requires that the metadata is not only present in the file but is also searchable. The most commonly used MT TF format to date, the historical Society of Exploration Geophysicists Electromagnetic Data Interchange Standard 1987 (EDI), no longer supports some of the needs of modern magnetotellurics, most notably accurate error bars recording. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of EDI’s and other historic MT TF formats has mostly kept the community away from healthy data sharing practices.\nRecently, the MT team at Oregon State University in collaboration with IRIS Data Management Center developed a new, XML-based format for MT transfer functions, and an online system for long-term storage, discovery and sharing of MT TF data worldwide (IRIS SPUD; www.iris.edu/spud/emtf). The system provides a query page where all of the MT transfer functions collected within the USArray MT experiment and other field campaigns can be searched for and downloaded; an automatic on-the-fly conversion to the historic EDI format is also included. To facilitate conversion to the new, more comprehensive and sustainable, XML format for MT TFs, and to streamline inclusion of historic data into the online database, we developed a set of open source format conversion tools, which can be used for rotation of MT TFs as well as a general XML <-> EDI converter (https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/emtf-fcu). Here, we report on the newly established collaboration between the USGS Geomagnetism Program and the Oregon State University to gather and convert both historic and modern-day MT or related transfer functions into the searchable database at the IRIS DMC. The more complete and free access to these previously collected MT TFs will be of great value to MT scientists both in planning future surveys, and then to leverage the value of the new data at the inversion and interpretation stage.",

The model takes into account steady motions, co-seismic and post-seismic slip from earthquakes in addition to slow-slip events at the southern end of the Hikurangi subduction zone. Initially, the GPS time series and interferogram data are used to estimate the transient (earthquake and slow-slip) parameters together with estimates of the secular velocities at the GPS sites. The steady tectonic deformation is modeled with a block–like structure that includes rotations and internal strain rates as well as inter-seismic strain rates estimated for locking on the faults bounding the blocks. The secular velocities are used to constrain the steady block model and then a full inversion is performed where the steady and transient parameters are adjusted to fit all the data. The result provides a predicted time history of deformation anywhere in the model domain that includes both transient and steady changes. Based on the predicted time histories of strain, we estimate time-dependent Coulomb stress changes along the major faults, in particular the Alpine fault. The goal is to understand better what features of the active deformation in the South Island drive faults toward failure and feed into an updated model of seismic hazard for this part of New Zealand.",

For this study we employed the impedances and vertical transfer functions from 144 sites from the EarthScope Transportable Array, along with data from previous higher density MT profiles from Cascadia (EMSLAB, CAFE-MT etc.). Morphological parameters for the subducting Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates (e.g. upper boundary and thickness) were extracted from McCrory et al (2012) and Schmandt and Humphreys (2010) seismological models and used to define a resistive subducting slab structure in 3D. This was then either used as a prior model, or fixed (both resistivity and geometry) during the MT inversion. By imposing constraints on the geometry of the slab (which is otherwise imaged as an amorphous broad resistive zone) we improve recovery and resolution of subduction related conductivity features. The constrained inversions also allowed us to test sensitivity of the MT data to variants on slab geometry, such as the proposed slab “tear” near the Oregon-Washington border suggested by some seismic tomography models, and to explore consistency of the MT data with seismic models, which suggest segmentation of back-arc upwelling. Three zones of substantially reduced resistivity were found, all exhibiting significant along-strike variability. In the forearc, an N-S stripe of high conductivity (10 ohm-m or less) was found just above the plate interface, near the tip of the mantle wedge. This conductive feature is spatially coincident with mapped locations of episodic tremor and slip, and likely represents aqueous fluids associated with slab dehydration. To the east, a second, clearly separated, N-S elongate zone of similarly high conductivity occurs in the mid-lower crust and upper mantle beneath the modern arc, again likely representing fluids, and in some cases melt. Finally, in the back-arc a broader, and generally more subdued (20-30 ohm-m), zone of reduced resistivity occurs in the North American mantle above the plate interface.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol wet deposition is the key aerosol loss mechanism globally, yet is not well-understood relative to aerosol sources and transformations. The difficulty in generating appropriate observational data sets is one important barrier to the study of aerosol wet removal. In this study, we combine two independent products based on satellite measurements. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is obtained from the ECMWF Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project, which is a re-analysis product that assimilates MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical depth. Rainfall is obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA-7). The latter product is available only from 50°N to 50°S, which sets our region of study. The data used is from 2011-12, is averaged to 6-hr intervals and has a horizontal resolution of 0.25°x0.25°. Our approach involves constructing a Lagrangian advection scheme that predicts aerosol AOD at the next time step (i.e. 6 hr in the future) based on current time step AOD and winds, and neglecting all aerosol sources and sinks. Predicted AOD is then compared with MACC reanalysis AOD conditioned on Lagrangian parcels that experienced rainfall during that interval, with AOD decreases attributed to wet deposition. Aerosol wet deposition is often parameterized in models as a function of rainfall rate using a power law. We evaluate the validity of such a power law relationship, and, when valid, compute the power law exponent globally, and by region (including continental and maritime locations) to reveal seasonal and geographic variability. Assuming precipitation is modulated by aerosol, at least in some regimes, then it follows that wet deposition also depends on AOD, and we quantify the strength of this coupling. This same approach could be used to study wet deposition of trace gases such as CO and ozone, as these are also available from the MACC re-analysis.",

Our goal is to illuminate the MSH magmatic system, using active- and passive-source seismology, magnetotellurics and petrology. Details of the velocity structure, coupled with other geophysical and geologic data, can help constrain the geometry and physical state of any bodies of melt beneath the volcano. The broadband array has a diameter of ~100 km centered on MSH with an average station spacing of 10 km, and will remain deployed through summer 2016. It is augmented by dozens of permanent stations in the area. We determine P-wave arrival times using Antelope software and incorporate permanent network picks for the region. We use the program struct3DP to invert travel times to obtain a 3-D seismic velocity model and relocate hypocenters, computing travel times using a 3-D eikonal-equation solver. There were more than 500 useable local events during the first year of iMUSH broadband recording, which to date have provided 5000 arrival times, with the number growing rapidly. The local events include 23 active shots that were set off in the summer of 2014 as part of the iMUSH experiment, which recorded with good signal-to-noise ratios across the entire array. The absolute P times will be augmented by differential times calculated by cross-correlation between observations at the same station for nearby event pairs. These will be incorporated into our model using double-difference tomography. We anticipate that our 3D velocity model will provide the highest resolution image of volcanic plumbing at MSH thus far. Our model interpretation will incorporate results from active-source and ambient noise tomography, receiver functions, magnetotellurics, and petrology.",

            "abstract": "An inversion algorithm (Trace Gas Inversion For Infrared Spectra, TGIF-IRS) was developed to derive the concentration of trace gases in volcanic plumes from hyperspectral infrared atmospheric radiance measurements. The TGIF-IRS inversion algorithm is set up to predict SO2 path length concentrations and/or location specific concentrations (assuming plume geometry). TGIF-IRS is based on a Partial Least Squared Regression (PLSR) model which was trained from data obtained using thermal IR radiative transfer calculations for different volcanic plume conditions, viewing geometries and atmospheric conditions. The IR radiative transfer calculations were based on MODTRAN5 (version 5.3.2) for computing the transmission and emission terms in a simplified radiative transfer equation. The TGIF-IRS algorithm was developed using PLSR because it is useful for applications with a large number of input variables which are not always independent. The input variables included the background sounding conditions (temperature, moisture and pressure vertical profiles), trace gases (minus SO2), plume geometries, plume temperatures and assumed temperature differences between the plume and the environment. The TGIF-IRS inversion algorithm was found to work well for elevation angles larger than 5 degrees. At lower elevation angles, the background sky was no longer cold and plume gaseous emissions became less distinguishable. Simulated long wave thermal IR radiances were compared to measured radiances and found to be in agreement confirming that the simulated thermal radiances were accurate.",

            "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that subduction megathrusts are extremely weak. The weakness is based on a spatial and temporal average. Spatially, a seismogenic megathrust may host interspersed stronger and weaker patches due to variations in pore fluid pressure, gouge properties, and fault zone structure. In the 2011 M=9 Tohoku-oki earthquake, one strong patch underwent a local stress drop of several tens of MPa, although the rupture-zone average of the stress drop is less than 5 MPa on the basis of all the (> 20) published rupture models for this earthquake that we have examined. Temporally, megathrust strength fluctuates in earthquake cycles, punctuated by coseismic weakening or strengthening of different patches. Using finite element modeling, we demonstrate that the weakness of the megathrust leads to a fragile state of stress in the overlying forearc wedge, where compression due to plate coupling and tension due to gravity are in a subtle balance that can be tipped by small perturbations. Prior to the Tohoku-oki earthquake, the Japan Trench forearc was predominantly under margin-normal compression, a state that can be modeled using an effective friction coefficient of 0.032 for the megathrust. In a coseismic deformation model, an average stress drop of about 4 MPa on the megathrust changes the offshore forearc into tension. This is consistent with the observed stress reversal in this region as a result of the Tohoku-oki earthquake. The same level of coseismic stress drop would not cause the observed forearc stress reversal if the megathrust was assumed to have a higher strength such as 0.045. The state of stress in the offshore forearc is so fragile that large changes can be caused by other seemingly benign perturbing factors. For example, without the ocean water compressing the continental slope, much of the offshore forearc would no longer be in compression even if the megathrust strength were twice the value of 0.032. If the slope angle of the continental slope were assumed to be lower than the actual value by a couple of degrees, the offshore forearc would be in compression even if megathrust friction were as low as 0.015. The fragility of forearc stresses has profound implications on the interplay between megathrust earthquakes and long-term upper plate deformation that operate on very different timescales.",

The technique produces outcomes for all Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the four greenhouse gas forcing scenarios adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For all GCMs and forcing scenarios, significant snow loss occurs at elevations below 2500 meters, despite increasing precipitation in many GCMs. The loss is significantly enhanced by snow albedo feedback. The approximate intermodel range in percent of total snow remaining in the entire region is 60-85% for a likely “mitigation” scenario, and 35-55% for the “business-as-usual” scenario. Thus significant snowpack decrease by century’s end is inevitable, even if the loss can be cushioned through greenhouse gas emissions reductions over the coming decades. The snowpack loss also leads to significant changes in runoff timing, which are also inevitable.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic, geologic and paleomagnetic data reveal that Oregon and parts of California, Nevada and Idaho rotate clockwise at 0.3 to 1.0 deg/Ma (relative to North America) about an axis near the Idaho-Oregon-Washington border, while northeast Washington is relatively fixed to North America. This rotation has been going on for at least 15 Ma. The spatial termination of the rotation requires shortening between Oregon and Washington. The Yakima fold and thrust belt (YFTB) lies along the boundary between northern Oregon and central Washington where convergence of the clockwise-rotating Oregon block is apparently accommodated. Shortening across the YFTB is thought to occur in a fan-like manner, increasing to the west. We obtained high-accuracy, high-density geodetic GPS measurements in 2012 and 2013 that are used with earlier measurements to characterize YFTB kinematics. Deformation associated with the YFTB starts in the south at the Blue Mountains Anticline in northern Oregon and extends northward to Frenchman Hills in Washington. To the east, the faulting and earthquake activity of the YFTB are truncated by a NNW-trending, narrow zone of deformation that runs along the Pasco Basin and Moses Lake region. It accommodates about 0.5 to 1.0 mm/yr of east to northeast shortening along the eastern boundary of the Department of Energy Hanford Site. The deforming zone aligns with recent seismicity in the Ice Harbor dike swarm, a relatively young ~ 8.5 Ma vent complex. West of the Cascade arc, shortening is accommodated by a series of east-trending faults, starting at the Doty fault in central coastal Washington and extending through Seattle up to the Canadian border. South of the Doty fault, other faults may take up some motion but may be too slow to resolve with GPS.",

To date, only a limited number of co-created citizen science projects, where community members are involved in most or all steps of the scientific process, have been initiated at contaminated sites and even less in conjunction with risk communication. Gardenroots: The Dewey-Humboldt AZ Garden Project was a place-based, co-created citizen science project where community members and researchers together: defined the question for study, developed hypotheses, collected environmental samples, disseminated results broadly, translated the results into action, and posed new research questions. This co-created environmental research project produced new data and addressed an additional exposure route (consumption of vegetables grown in soils with elevated arsenic levels) that was not being evaluated in the current site assessment. Furthermore, co-producing science led to both individual learning and social-ecological outcomes. This approach illustrates the benefits of a co-created citizen-science program in addressing the complex problems that arise in communities neighboring a hazardous waste sites. Such a project increased the community’s involvement in regional environmental assessment and decision-making, which has the potential to help mitigate environmental exposures and thereby reduce associated risks.",

Improvements in hydrogen fuel cell efficiency and cost are sought. By use of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) propagules as an oxygen source the effects of Luteolin and Taxasterol could be tested as a means to optimize hydrogen fuel cells. The methodology began with physical chemical extraction, then proceeded with separation by column chromatography, and ended with fuel cell testing of the isolated phytochemicals. Published retention factor values were used to isolate Luteolin (.66) and Taxasterol (.30). In order to test electrical energy yield, the amount of current produced by the fuel cell was measured in microamperes (μA\n[RB1]\n ) over five minutes for both the three control and three experimental group trials for both experimental groups each. The largest ampere value collected from Luteolin group was 4.3 μA, while the largest value collected from Taxasterol group was 2.5 μA. Out of both experimental groups, taraxsterol had the smallest range, showing more consistency between the control and corresponding experimental groups tested. My hypothesis was not supported.

The Boiling Lake-Valley of Desolation area is part of a volcano-hydrothermal system on the island and was identified as the most likely location for a future eruption (Lindsay et. al, 2005). The last phreatic eruption on the island took place within the Boiling Lake-Valley of Desolation area in 1997. In addition to these eruptions the Boiling Lake has undergone six brief periods of physical and chemical instabilities during its 150 years of recorded history. The latest period occurred in 2004-2005 when the Boiling Lake experienced erratic disruptions in geothermal activity. It repeatedly emptied and refilled before returning to its long term stable state. Given such long term stability, a significant, but historically infrequent, perturbation is required to upset the Lake’s dynamic equilibrium. Prior to 2004-2005, the factor(s) triggering the instabilities have not been identified.\nThe current work is part of a multi-scale approach at understanding volcano-hydrothermal systems from a geophysical perspective, which incorporates modeling and observed data.\nHere, the author briefly introduces the multi-scale approach and then focuses on the role of regional earthquakes as possible triggers of the Lake’s disruptions. This is discussed in terms of seismic events, induced stress-fields, faults systems and hydrodynamic changes. Finally the author reports on a number of significant events which may define the long elusive perturbation affecting the Boiling Lake.",

Nevertheless, the potential downstream dilution of such a signal can profoundly affect interpretations, but is a poorly researched topic that is often not considered. In the eastern Himalaya, the syntaxis (Namche Barwa) is exhuming and eroding anomalously fast compared to the rest of Himalaya (Zeitler et al., 2001; Zeitler et al., 2014), providing a significant amount of material drained into the major modern fluvial system, the Yarlung-Siang-Brahmaputra river. It is therefore the ideal location to study dilution effects, given the syntaxis distinctive (young) signal and the volume of detritus eroded from it.\nMajor questions concern how the distribution of the syntaxis signal is evolving in the main Siang- Brahmaputra drainage system at different position upstream and downstream, and how this aspect is related to the influence of the main Himalayan tributaries.\nWe sampled fifteen modern rivers samples from the Yarlung-Brahmaputra river system upstream of the syntaxis, at an increased distance downstream from the syntaxis and from the Brahmaputra tributaries draining the Himalaya and the Lohit plutonic suite. We tested two different thermo-chronometers, 40Ar/39Ar on white mica and detrital zircon fission tracks, to evaluate the effect of the dilution of the syntaxis signal downstream. Our results show a youngest age peak distinctive of the syntaxis in both the mica and zircon datasets. However, whilst the distinctive young zircon peak endures many kms downstream, the young mica population becomes heavily diluted, presumably either due to hydrodynamic and transport effects, or due to input from tributaries draining the Higher Himalaya.",

Theoretical and laboratory-based studies have mostly focused on the formation of sulfuric and nitric acid from SO2 and NOx, respectively, while redox reactions induced by the co-injection of O2 have received little attention. Here we present results from the first field-based experiment pointing to an important role of O2.\nAt the CO2CRC Otway Project site, CO2 and CO2 enriched with impurities (54 ppm SO2, 9 ppm NOx and 6150 ppm O2) were mixed at depth with water leading to CO2 saturated water. The CO2 saturated water was then allowed to react with the reservoir at a depth of 1400 m (Paaratte Formation, Otway Basin) over a total of 23 days. Reservoir water at in situ pressure conditions was taken for analyses using the U-tube sampling system. Back-produced water showed no evidence of silica or carbonate mineral dissolution, which can be explained by the level of alkalinity effectively buffering the additional acidity (as the result of the co-injection of SO2 and NOx). Independently, co-injected O2 caused oxidation of pyrite, resulting in rapid increase in SO42- concentration during the first three days of the subsurface incubation. Subsequently, the SO42- concentration dropped in the back-produced water, which may be explained by SO42- adsorption on the surface of minerals like iron (oxyhydr)oxides and kaolinite or by reduced pyrite oxidation at distance from the well bore. Reactive transport modeling is currently underway to better understand the observations.",

            "abstract": "Typhoon ‘Bolaven’ passed the Okinawa Main Island at about 1200 UTC 26 August 2012, while moving northwestward. The radar images showed that ‘Bolaven’ had the multiple eyewall structure. The surface observation data at Nago of Okinawa showed that the precipitation and surface wind velocity in the typhoon’s central region were weaker than those of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)’s operational forecast.\nCloud-resolving ensemble simulations were performed to investigate the relations between the multiple eyewall structure and the wind features in the typhoon’s central regions. The ensemble simulations reproduced double eyewall structures in several members. To evaluate the reproducibility of multiple eyewall structures, the multi-eye index (MEI) was defined in this study.\nCompared with the members in which the typhoon had the spiral rainband structures, the pressure gradients in the typhoon’s central region of the small MEI (multiple eyewall) members were weak. The precipitation and surface wind velocity were also weaker than those of the typhoons with spiral rainbands. In case of the multiple eyewall typhoon, the gentle pressure gradients and the associated weaker surface inflows suppressed convections in the inner eyewall.\nThe statistical analysis was performed based on the ensemble prediction. A clear positive correlation was indicated between the MEI and the wind velocity (tangential wind and inward radial wind) in the typhoon’s central region. This result explains the reason why the actual wind velocity was weaker than that of the original JMA’s forecast.\nThe relationship between the atmospheric environmental factors around the typhoon (e.g., level of free convection and convective available potential energy) and MEI was investigated from the outputs of ensemble simulations. The results indicated that there were no strong relations between them. This suggests that the formation of the multiple eyewall structures is not simply determined by the atmospheric environmental parameters but depends on more complicated conditions around the typhoon at the timing of their formation.",

In-situ and satellite data analyses show that the ocean upper layer cooling can last for several weeks after disappearance of the cyclonic wind forcing, and the density disturbance occurs down to the depth of several hundred meters. Associated with the cooling in the cyclone center, the horizontal density gradient helps to develop cyclonic ocean eddies. Numerical modeling of the upper ocean with cyclonic wind forcing suggests the baroclinicity induced by the strong wind forcing is responsible for the ocean mesoscale eddy development that may further affected by the translation speed of a cyclone.",

            "abstract": "Recently we proposed (Opher et al. 2015) that the structure of the heliosphere might be very different than we previously thought. The classic accepted view of the heliosphere is a quiescent, comet-like shape aligned in the direction of the Sun’s travel through the interstellar medium (ISM) extending for thousands of astronomical units. We have shown, based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, that the tension force of the twisted magnetic field of the Sun confines the solar wind plasma beyond the termination shock and drives jets to the north and south very much like astrophysical jets. These heliospheric jets are deflected into the tail region by the motion of the Sun through the ISM. As in some astrophysical jets the interstellar wind blows the two jets into the tail but is not strong enough to force the lobes into a single comet-like tail. Instead, the interstellar wind flows around the heliosphere and into the equatorial region between the two jets. We show that the heliospheric jets are turbulent (due to large-scale MHD instabilities and reconnection) and strongly mix the solar wind with the ISM. The resulting turbulence has important implications for particle acceleration in the heliosphere. The two-lobe structure is consistent with the energetic neutral atom (ENA) images of the heliotail from IBEX where two lobes are visible in the north and south and the suggestion from the Cassini ENAs that the heliosphere is “tailless.” The new structure of the heliosphere is supported by recent analytic work (Drake et al. 2015) that shows that even in high \\beta heliosheath the magnetic field plays a crucial role in funneling the solar wind in two jets. Here we present these recent results and show that the heliospheric jets mediate the draping of the magnetic field and the conditions ahead of the heliopause. We show that reconnection between the interstellar and solar magnetic field both at the flanks of the jets and in between them twist the interstellar magnetic field in a small layer ahead of the HP in agreement with Voyager 1 observations (as seen in Opher & Drake 2013). We present results of the heliospheric jets for a weaker magnetic field, representative of the 2010-2012 period and what is expected to be seen in the ENA maps with solar cycle.",

            "abstract": "Although it is well recognized that solar eruptions are the most powerful driver of space weather, why and how these eruptions occur are still open questions. Over the past forty years a variety of models have been proposed to explain the initiation mechanism of solar eruptions. Some researchers emphasize the importance of ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, by which, magnetic flux ropes that emerge from the convection zone or form above the photosphere are launched into the outer corona. Others stress the primary role of magnetic reconnection, and believe that without reconnection eruptions can never happen even if the magnetic energy is excessively supplied. All these models are, however, idealized or hypothetical simplification of the realistic case that is much more complex and elusive in observation. Here we will show how the solar eruptions originate and develop in an unprecedentedly realistic way by using full MHD modeling driven directly by magnetic field data from observation without any kind of artificial configuration or constraint. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce the magnetic field and its evolution in an excellent agreement with the state-of-the-art EUV observation following the timeline from a long-duration quasi-static evolution (over days) to the fast eruption (in minutes), which is a typical evolution pattern of solar eruptions from its origin to onset. Our studied events represent a wide range of flares from the minor C-class to major X-class and include both the confined and eruptive ones. We conclude that magnetic flux emergence and the resulted photospheric shearing motions play a primary role in leading to the solar eruptions and their triggers can either be magnetic reconnection or MHD instability, and how the solar eruptions occur, once being triggered, can be predicted by following evolution of the unstable pre-eruptive magnetic configuration.",

            "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) forward models of synthetic gravity anomalies are calculated and compared to observed gravity anomalies using geostatistical models of density variations in the subsurface, constrained by geologic data. These models have an advantage over forward gravity models generated using polygonal bodies of homogeneous density because the homogeneous density restriction is relaxed, allowing density variations internal to geologic bodies to be considered. By discretizing the subsurface and calculating the cumulative gravitational effect of each cell, multiple forward models can be generated for a given geologic body, which expands the exploration of the solution space. Furthermore, the stochastic models can be designed to match the observed statistical properties of the internal densities of the geologic units being modeled. The results of such stochastically generated forward gravity models can then be compared with the observed data.\nTo test this modeling approach, we compared stochastic forward gravity models of 2D geologic cross-sections to gravity data collected along a profile across the Vaca Fault near Fairfield, California. Three conceptual geologic models were created, each representing a distinct fault block scenario (normal, strike-slip, reverse) with four rock units in each model. Using fixed rock unit boundaries, the units were populated with geostatistically generated density values, characterized by their respective histogram and vertical variogram. The horizontal variogram could not be estimated because of lack of data, and was therefore left as a free parameter. Each fault block model had multiple geostatistical realizations of density associated with it. Forward models of gravity were then generated from the fault block model realizations, and rejection sampling was used to determine viable fault block density models. Given the constraints on subsurface density, the normal and strike-slip fault model were the most likely.",

            "abstract": "Multi-component statistical techniques and GIS visualization are emerging trends in understanding large data sets. Our research applies these techniques to a large igneous geochemical data set from southern California to better understand magmatic and plate tectonic processes. A set of 480 granitic samples collected by Baird from this area were analyzed for 39 geochemical elements. Of these samples, 287 are from the Peninsular Ranges Batholith (PRB) and 164 from part of the Transverse Ranges (TR).\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) summarized the 39 variables into 3 principal components (PC) by matrix multiplication and for the PRB  are interpreted as follows: PC1 with about 30% of the variation included mainly compatible elements and SiO2 and indicates extent of differentation;  PC2 with about 20% of the variation included HFS elements and may indicate crustal contamination as usually identified by Sri; PC3 with about 20% of the variation included mainly HRE elements and may indicate magma source depth as often diplayed using REE spider diagrams and possibly Sr/Y. Several elements did not fit well in any of the three components: Cr, Ni, U, and Na2O.\nFor the PRB, the PC1 correlation with SiO2 was r=-0.85, the PC2 correlation with Sri was r=0.80, and the PC3 correlation with Gd/Yb was r=-0.76 and with Sr/Y was r=-0.66 . Extending this method to the TR, correlations were r=-0.85, -0.21, -0.06, and -0.64, respectively. A similar extent of correlation for both areas was visually evident using GIS interpolation.\nPC1 seems to do well at indicating differentiation index for both the PRB and TR and  correlates very well with SiO2, Al2O3,  MgO, FeO*, CaO,  K2O, Sc, V, and Co, but poorly with Na2O and Cr. If the crustal component is represented  by Sri, PC2 correlates well and less expesively with this indicator in the PRB, but not in the TR. Source depth has been related to the slope on REE spidergrams, and PC3 based on only the HREE and using the Sr/Y ratios gives a reasonable correlation for both PRB and TR, but the Gd/Yb ratio gives a reasonable correlation for only the PRB.\nThe PRB data provide reasonable correlation between principal components and standard geochemical indicators, perhaps because of the well-recognized monotonic variation from SW to NE. Data sets from the TR give similar results in some cases, but poor correlation in others.",

However, barriers due to skill remain when utilizing this model data to project changes in precipitation over mountainous areas at regional and subregional scales. Complex topography, localized meteorological phenomenon, and other factors are still not well represented by global scale models, which can limit the representation of key impact criteria needed for planning.We explore limitations and opportunities of utilizing precipitation data from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5(CMIP5) models to provide use relevant projections of future precipitation conditions in Western Colorado, with a focus on applications relevant to climate information needs in the resort community of Aspen. First, a model skill evaluation is conducted by comparing precipitation and temperature values of selected model ensemble from CMIP5 to observations during a historical period. The comparison is conducted for both temporal and spatial scales, on both yearly and seasonal increments. Results indicate that the models are more skillful at representing temperature than precipitation and that the apparent lack of skill for precipitation warrants caution in the use of such data in climate impacts assessment that serve to inform adaptation planning and preparedness decision making. In light of model evaluation, the authors introduce a scenario based method in which individual models within the CMIP5 ensemble are organized into plausible qualitative futures and individual model runs are selected as representative scenarios by which detailed analysis can then be applied. The results from scenario based method are viewed as useful for exploring regional climate futures in instances when it is not appropriate to utilize data directly from global-scale climate models.",

            "abstract": "High latitude watersheds experience a dramatic seasonality of up to nine months of cold, snow covered winter and a warm, bright, summer. Spring melt runoff is a dramatic two to three week period when up to 75% of the yearly precipitation runs off. Identifying sources and measuring fluxes of compounds out of Arctic rivers is difficult in large rivers because they represent the combined effect of innumerable plot-scale melt water sources, each coming from different soil and vegetation types, each experiencing a slightly different melt timing and evolution. Numerous studies have shown spring melt is characterized by an ionic pulse of solutes, dissolved organic carbon and other nutrients (ammonium, phosphate and nitrate) leached by snow melt water from surface vegetation and soils. Summer and fall flows are comprised largely of shallow to deepening sources from a downwardly expanding seasonally thawed (“active”) layer. In late summer flowpaths deepen and the biogeochemical composition of surface waters may be sourced from an increasing mineral weathering zone representing landscape scale soil processes. The watershed biogeochemical response to precipitation may also yield insight into subsurface permafrost geomorphological characteristics and flowpaths through water tracks or other small depressions. Winter processes are the least studied or understood but overflow ice (“aufeis”) provides access to deep, old waters. The deeper snow pack in depressions can provide protection against winter cold and feed back to deeper summer season thaw. This presentation will focus on using water stable isotopes, major ion concentrations, trace metals, nutrients, and permafrost delineation to identify biogeochemical sources in watersheds draining continuous and discontinuous permafrost in Alaska. Biogeochemical processes associated with scaling, meteorology, and climate warming will be discussed.",

The Noah land surface model (LSM) default simulation uses SHPs selected according to a location’s mapped soil texture class. SHPs are instead estimated at seven sites in North America through calibration. A single-objective algorithm minimizes the root mean squared difference (RMSD) between simulated surface soil moisture and observations from: (1) a dense network of in situ soil probes, (2) SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) satellite retrievals, and (3) SMOS retrievals adjusted such that their mean equals that of the in situ network. Parameters are optimized in 2012 and validated in 2013 against the in situ network. RMSD and unbiased RMSD (ubRMSD) assess the resulting surface soil moisture behavior.\nAt all sites, assigning SHP parameters from a different soil texture than the one that is mapped decreases the RMSD, by an average of 0.029 cm3 cm-3. Similar improvements result from calibrating parameters using in situ network data (0.031 cm3 cm-3). Calibrations using remotely-sensed data show comparable success (0.029 cm3 cm-3) if the SMOS product has no bias. Calibrated simulations are superior to texture-based simulations in their ability to decrease ubRMSD at times of year when the default simulation is worst. Changes to both RMSD and ubRMSD are small when the default simulation is already good. Most calibrated simulations have higher runoff ratios than do texture-based simulations, a change that warrants further evaluation. Overall, parameter selection using SMOS data shows good potential where biases are low.",

The helium isotopic composition of Okinawa Trough, 6.6±1.0 Ra is much smaller than that of Izu-Bonin samples, 8.4±0.5 Ra. Those of Mariana Trough samples are similar to those of the Okinawa Trough, whereas Lau Basin data are consistent with those of Izu-Bonin. These characteristics might reflect the tectonic setting of regions: the former is related to back-arc spreading or rifting with a sediment signature in a graben, although the latter is attributable to island-arc type magmatism and/or its influence to back-arc volcanism. Argon and nitrogen isotopes are also explainable according to a similar hypothesis, although carbon isotopes are not the discriminator of tectonics. Origins of carbon and nitrogen are estimated respectively by the δ13C-CO2/3He and δ15N-N2/36Ar diagrams. The sedimentary contributions of both carbon and nitrogen are larger in Okinawa and Mariana Troughs than in Izu-Bonin and Lau Basin, whereas Kuroko samples agree well with the latter. Carbon and nitrogen fluxes are again larger in the former than in the latter. The CO2/N2 flux ratio at Okinawa and Mariana Troughs is larger than that at Izu-Bonin and Lau Basin, although both are considerably larger than that at MOR, suggesting that the additional sedimentary component has a higher C/N ratio than the upper mantle value.",

            "abstract": "Persistent lava lakes are a testament to sustained magma supply and outgassing in basaltic systems, and the surface activity of lava lakes has been used to infer processes in the underlying magmatic system. At Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i, the lava lake in Halema`uma`u Crater has been closely studied for several years with webcam imagery, geophysical, petrological and gas emission techniques. The lava lake in Halema`uma`u is now the second largest on Earth, and provides an unprecedented opportunity for detailed observations of lava lake outgassing processes. We observe that steady activity is characterized by continuous southward motion of the lake’s surface and slow changes in lava level, seismic tremor and gas emissions. This normal, steady activity can be abruptly interrupted by the appearance of spattering – sometimes triggered by rockfalls - on the lake surface, which abruptly shifts the lake surface motion, lava level and gas emissions to a more variable, unstable regime. The lake commonly alternates between this a) normal, steady activity and b) unstable behavior several times per day. The spattering represents outgassing of shallowly accumulated gas in the lake. Therefore, although steady lava lake behavior at Halema`uma`u may be deeply driven by upwelling of magma, we argue that the sporadic interruptions to this behavior are the result of shallow processes occurring near the lake surface. These observations provide a cautionary note that some lava lake behavior is not representative of deep-seated processes. This behavior also highlights the complex and dynamic nature of lava lake activity.",

            "abstract": "Frustrations regarding the provision of actionable science extend to both producers and consumers. Scientists decry the lack of application of their research in shaping policy and practices while decision makers bemoan the lack of applicability of scientific research to the specific problems at hand or its narrow focus relative to the plethora of engineering, economic and social considerations that they must also consider. Incorporating climate change adds additional complexity due to uncertainties in estimating many facets of future climate, the inherent variability of climate and the decadal scales over which significant changes will develop. Recently a set of guidelines for successful science-policy interaction was derived from the analysis of transboundary water management. These are; 1 recognizing that science is a crucial but bounded input into the decision-making processes, 2 early establishment of conditions for collaboration and shared commitment among participants, 3 understanding that science–policy interactions are enhanced through greater collaboration and social or group-learning processes, 4 accepting that the collaborative production of knowledge is essential to build legitimate decision-making processes, and 5 engaging boundary organizations and informal networks as well as formal stakeholders. Here we present as a case study research on California coastal marshes, climate change and sea-level that is being conducted by university and USGS scientists under the auspices of the Southwest Climate Science Center. We also present research needs identified by a seperate analysis of best practices for coastal marsh restoration in the face of climate change that was conducted in extensive consultation with planners and managers. The initial communication, scientific research and outreach-dissemination of the marsh scientfic study are outlined and compared to best practices needs identified by planners and the science-policy guidelines outlined above. Matches, mismatches, early-stage evidence of applicability and potential improvements of program development and design are considered.",

            "abstract": "To investigate aerosol characteristics over East Asia, many campaigns using in-situ measurements, ground and satellite based remote sensing, and air quality modeling have been conducted as ACE-Asia in 2001, ABC-EAREX in 2005, and DRAGON-NE Asia in 2012, and planned KORUS-AQ in 2016. Planned KORUS-AQ 2016 campaigns provides excellent opportunity to monitor and analyze air quality including aerosol and trace gases from diverse platform including ground-based, airborne, shipborne and satellite platform. Prior to the upcoming KORUS-AQ campaign, the Megacity Air Pollution Studies (MAPS)-Seoul campaign was held from May 18 to June14, 2015. During the campaign, total 8 AERONET sunphotometers are deployed over Korea. GOCI Yonsei aerosol retrieval (YAER) algorithm was developed, improved and evaluated through the DRAGON-NE Asia campaign. GOCI YAER AOD at 550 nm with spatial resolution of 6 km showed good agreement with AERONET AOD (R > 0.88) during the DRAGON-NE Asia campaign. In this study, aerosol optical properties from AERONET and GOCI are analyzed together during the MAPS-Seoul campaign. Mean AERONET AOD at 550 nm over a megacity site, Seoul and a coastal site Gosan shows the lowest values in 2015 as 0.338 and 0.214, respectively, compared with values during the same period from 2011 to 2014 (0.557–0.645 at Seoul, and 0.447–0.618 at Gosan). GOCI YAER algorithm uses the minimum reflectivity technique from the composited Rayleigh-corrected reflectance during a month thus low AOD increase a possibility to find clear pixels to obtain accurate surface reflectance. To improve surface reflectance quality, multi-year GOCI data are also analyzed. Furthermore higher spatial resolution retrieval in 3 km is tested to detect small-scale aerosol features and point sources in megacities. DRAGON-NE Asia in 2012, MAPS-Seoul in 2015, and planned KORUS-AQ in 2016 field campaigns contribute to the continuous assessment of GOCI YAER algorithm performance for the improvements.",

            "abstract": "The New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) in the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) is the site of several major M 6.8-8 earthquakes in 1811-1812, and remains seismically active. Although extensive investigations have been carried out, the ultimate controls on earthquake initiation and the duration of the seismicity remains unclear. Especially ambiguous is the role of a heterogenetic lithosphere in the development and propagation of stress throughout the crust in intraplate settings. In this study, we develop a finite element model to conduct a series of numerical experiments, the goal of which is to determine the impact of heterogeneity in the Upper Crust, the Lower Crust, and the Mantle on earthquake nucleation and rupture processes. Results indicate that when the differential stresses are built up from boundary displacements, similar to tectonic loading, the stresses below the Reelfoot Rift in the NMSZ are highly concentrated, whereas the stresses below the geologically similar Midcontinent Rift System are low, corresponding with the earthquakes distribution. By comparing the results with three reference models, we argue that the extensive Mantle Low Velocity Zone (MLVZ) beneath the NMSZ produces differential stress localization in the layers above. Furthermore, the relatively strong crust in this region, exhibited by high seismic velocity, enables the elevated stress to extend to the bottom of the ancient rift system, reactivating fossil rifting faults and therefore triggering earthquakes. Although our numerical models focus on loading by a far-field stress source, they explain why the New Madrid inevitably became the most earthquake susceptible region in the CEUS since a heterogeneous lithosphere. Specifically, the presence of the MLVZ will further concentrate stresses resulting from other unloading process, such as melting of the ice sheets or sudden river incision.",

            "abstract": "The inner moons of Saturn – Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione and Rhea - exhibit remarkable large-scale albedo and color variations. These trends can be linked to a combination of the unique exogenic processes occurring the Saturn system, including E-ring grain bombardment and charged particle bombardment. One of the fascinating characteristics of the Saturn system is that the icy satellites, though their surface compositions are dominated by water ice, are spectrally red – they are absorbing in the ultraviolet-visible wavelength region (wavelengths <~550 nm) – a spectral feature not typical of pure water ice. In fact, the existing data show that in the UV, absorptions appear to be present superimposed on the overall red slope. Thus, though Cassini instruments have learned much about the surfaces of the icy moons, a basic question that remains is: What is their surface composition and what are the species or processes that cause these UV absorptions? Cassini’s spectral coverage is lacking in precisely the near-UV wavelength regime in which the satellites appear to absorb most strongly. To resolve this issue and determine some understanding of the surface species present, we have obtained data using HST/STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph). We have utilized the STIS G230L detector to obtain high SNR spectra in the 180-320 nm region along with short G430L exposures to obtain spectra in the 320-570 nm range, to completely fill in the Cassini gap in spectral coverage. Full-disk measurements have been made of the trailing and leading hemispheres of Mimas, Dione and Rhea; a spectrum of Enceladus was also obtained. We report on the results. In particular, we discuss implications for the presence of ammonia, ozone and organics.",

            "abstract": "Jupiter’s moon Europa is comprised of an icy shell and a ~100 km thick global ocean overlying a rocky core. Among the myriad topographic features etched across its enigmatic surface, double ridges, which consist of two raised flanks with a central trough, are the most pervasive. Often running for hundreds of kilometers, they frequently overprint and offset pre-existing features and appear to be genetically related to cracks in the icy shell. Yet, after nearly two decades of study, these ridge systems and the processes through which they form remain incompletely understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed for ridge formation, one of which is that they are the surface expression of cryovolcanic dikes. Previous mechanical models have considered the elastic response of the icy shell above a crystallizing cryo-volcanic intrusion. We present results from numerical models in which we treat the ice shell as a viscoelastoplastic medium and explore the variability of topographic expression due to varying rates of intrusion and tectonic extension/shortening. The irreversible viscous and plastic response of Europa’s ice shell during intrusion allows large-amplitude topography to develop, comparable to the topographic relief associated with double ridges.",

            "abstract": "Although electrical anisotropy is likely at various scales in the Earth, present 3D inversion codes only allow for isotropic models. In fact, any effects of anisotropy present in any real data can always be accommodated by (possibly fine scale) isotropic structures. This suggests that some complex structures found in 3D inverse solutions (e.g., alternating elongate conductive and resistive \"streaks\" of Meqbel et al. (2014)), may actually represent anisotropic layers. As a step towards better understanding how anisotropy is manifest in 3D inverse models, and to better incorporate anisotropy in 3D MT interpretations, we have implemented new 1D, 2D AND 3D forward modeling codes which allow for general anisotropy and are implemented in matlab using an object oriented (OO) approach. The 1D code is used primarily to provide boundary conditions (BCs). For the 2D case we have used the OO approach to quickly develop and compare several variants including different formulations (three coupled electric field components, one electric and one magnetic component coupled) and different discretizations (staggered and fixed grids). The 3D case is implemented in integral form on a staggered grid, using either 1D or 2D BC. Iterative solvers, including divergence correction, allow solution for large model grids. As an initial application of these codes we are conducting synthetic inversion tests. We construct test models by replacing streaky conductivity layers, as found at the top of the mantle in the EarthScope models of Meqbel et al. (2014), with simpler smoothly varying anisotropic layers. The modeling process is iterated to obtain a reasonable match to actual data. Synthetic data generated from these 3D anisotropic models can then be inverted with a 3D code (ModEM) and compared to the inversions obtained with actual data. Results will be assessed, taking into account the diffusive nature of EM imaging, to better understand how actual anisotropy is mapped to structure by 3D isotropic inversion.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical processes that control microbial growth, organic carbon degradation, and CO2 production and migration are fundamentally occur at the pore scale. In this presentation, we will describe our recent results of a pore-scale simulation research to investigate: 1) how moisture content and distribution affects oxygen delivery, organic carbon availability, and microbial activities that regulate the rate of organic carbon degradation and CO2 production in aerobic systems; and 2) how pore-scale reactive transport processes affect local microbial growth, biofilm formation, and overall rate of microbial reactions in anoxic systems. The results revealed that there is an optimal moisture content for aerobic bacterial respiration and CO2 production. When moisture is below the optimal value, organic carbon availability limits its degradation due to diffusion and osmotic stress to bacterial reactivity; and when moisture is above the optimal value, oxygen delivery limits microbial respiration. The optimal moisture condition is, however, a function of soil texture and physical heterogeneity, bioavailable soil organic carbon, and microbial community function. In anoxic and saturated system, simulation results show that biofilm preferentially forms in concave areas around sand particles and macro aggregates where cross-directional fluxes of organic carbon and electron acceptors (e.g., nitrate) favor microbial growth and attachment. The results provide important insights to the establishment of constitutive relationships between the macroscopic rates of soil organic carbon degradation and moisture content, and to the development of biogeochemical reactive transport models that incorporate biofilm structures and physio-chemical heterogeneity in soils and sediments.",

            "abstract": "This paper reports on the rock-magnetic properties of single zircon crystals, which are essential for future work establishing the paleointensity method using single zircon crystals. Zircon crystals used in this study were sampled from the Nakagawa River, which crosses the Tanzawa tonalitic pluton in central Japan. Rock-magnetic measurements were conducted on 1037 grains of zircons, but many of these measurements are below the limits of the sensitivity of the magnetometers employed. Isothermal remanent magnetizations (IRMs) of 876 zircon crystal are below the practical resolution of this study; we infer that these crystal contain no or only minute quantities of ferromagnetic minerals. The other zircon crystals contain enough magnetic minerals to be measured in the DC SQUID magnetometer. For 81 zircon crystals, IRM intensity (MIRM) are larger than 4 × 10−12 Am2, while natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensity (MNRM) are below 4 × 10−12 Am2, indicating that these crystals are inappropriate for the paleomagnetic study. For the samples that had values of MNRM ≥ 4 × 10−12 Am2 and MIRM ≥ 4 × 10−12 Am2, combining the rock-magnetic parameter, we proposed the sample selection criteria for future study of paleointensity experiments using single zircon crystals. In the case that the samples had high Bc values (>10 mT) or high MNRM/MIRM values (>~0.1), main remanence carriers are probably pyrrhotite and these samples are inappropriate for the paleointensity study. In the case that the samples had low Bc values (<10 mT) and low MNRM/MIRM values (<~0.1), main remanence carrier seem to be nearly pure magnetite with PSD grain sizes and these samples are expected to appropriate for the paleointensity study. Total thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) acquisition experiments were also carried out for 12 samples of the zircon crystals satisfying the above criteria. The TRM intensity was comparable with that of NRM, and a rough estimation of the paleointensity using NRM/TRM ratios shows field intensities consistent with the average geomagnetic field intensity at the Tanzawa tonalitic pluton for last 5 Myr.",

            "abstract": "A portion of the Peruvian Coastal Batholith near Ica, Peru is being studied using stable isotopes to determine the source of hydrothermal fluids that caused propylitic, phyllic, and potassic alteration in the mineralized Linga plutonic complex. Sources of hydrothermal fluids and water/rock ratios are estimated to understand the role of such fluids in alteration during cooling.\nA set of 64 mineral analysis from 18 igneous samples, 7 unaltered and 11 altered, were analyzed for D/H and 18O/16O isotopes. The δ18O values for whole rocks with no apparent alteration vary from +6.8‰ to +7.9‰, with sets of δ18O mineral values indicating isotopic equilibrium at closure temperatures from 571°C to 651°C, and no interaction with meteoric water. This conclusion is bolstered by hornblende (–87‰ to –64‰) and biotite (–81‰ to –74‰) δD values\nMost δ18O values for samples with hydrothermal alteration suggest that alteration results from magmatic fluids; however, several analyses indicate interaction with other fluids. The high δ18O values for plagioclase (+9.3‰) and hornblende (+6.3‰) from a metamorphic aureole in volcanic host rock near a plutonic intrusion may be due to interaction with metamorphic or low temperature magmatic fluids. Plagioclase (+2.6‰) and biotite (+0.1‰) δ18O values in a sample from the Jurassic volcanic envelope indicate a significant effect from meteoric-hydrothermal fluids. An altered monzonite yielded δ18O values for quartz (+5.5‰), K-spar (+5.6‰), and magnetite (+0.4‰), also suggesting interaction with meteoric fluids. A diorite from an area with strong epidotization produced an epidote δD value of –25.8‰ and a monzonite from a highly veined area has an epidote δD value of –36.1‰ suggesting interaction with sea water.\nThis new data indicate that the Linga complex was primarily influenced by magmatic hydrothermal fluids, but metamorphic, meteoric, and sea water may have had some influence in producing alteration assemblages and in cooling the magmatic complex.",

            "abstract": "Understanding connections between climate, ecosystems, and society during historical and modern climatic transitions requires annual resolution records with high fidelity climate signals. In semi-arid regions, high temperatures are projected to increase the frequency, duration, and severity of droughts in coming decades. Between 1996-2014, Mongolia experienced an extended drought that coincided with a transition away from pastoralism as thousands of families lost their herds and migrated to informal urban settlements. Because Mongolia’s climate is highly variable, it is difficult to place recent climatic extremes and associated social and ecological change in context without long records of climatic variability. Here we ask: how extreme was the 21st century drought in the last 2000 years? We present two 2000 year long tree-ring reconstructions of warm-season drought, derived from live and dead Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) trees from two lava flows in central Mongolia. Trees growing on the lava today are stunted and widely spaced, occurring on microsites with little to no soil development. These trees are water-stressed and their radial growth is correlated with both soil water availability (scPDSI) and grassland productivity (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)). To contextualize the severity of recent droughts and to explore potential forcing factors, we compare recent drought persistence to the distribution of events in the past and perform long control runs of GFDL climate model. Our reconstructions, calibrated and validated on instrumental June-August scPDSI (1959-2009) account for >55% of the variability in the regional scPDSI when >70% of the annual rainfall occurs. Our tree-ring data combined with existing reconstructions of temperature, meteorological data, and model results suggest that the early 21st century drought was the hottest and one of the most persistent droughts in the last 2000 years. These dry conditions were occurred with reductions in NPP of grasslands and loss of lake area. Our results are consistent with model projections of warming in Inner Asia but suggest that future warming may overwhelm increases in precipitation leading to similar “heat droughts”, with potentially severe ecological and social consequences for Mongolia.",

Previous research shows that channel features exist on the central edifice and flanks of Alba Mons along steeply sloped portions of the volcano. These fluvial channels are embayed by younger lava flows and disrupted by graben, indicating they formed while the volcano was still active. The purpose of this study is to determine what meltwater channel morphology and distribution on Alba Mons indicate about volcano-ice interactions when the volcano was active. This study involves mapping surface features around Alba Mons, followed by a detailed investigation of individual well-defined channels using high resolution images to quantitatively relate channel morphology to formation processes and environmental conditions during volcanic activity. High-resolution analysis is currently ongoing, and results from the study will be presented. Channel networks and drainage basins on the northern side of the volcano are numerous and well-defined, allowing for high-resolution 2D and 3D analysis.",

            "abstract": "Due to the massive earthquakes and tsunami on March 11th 2011 in Eastern Japan, Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) was severely damaged. Radioactive materials were released and spread out by atmospheric advection-diffusion. Especially on March 21 - 23th when precipitation was observed, “hotspot” where the high concentration was detected locally. This area was formed in the metropolitan area in Kanto region. Thus, pollution at water treatment plants because of the deposition became a concern. Therefore, the reliable information of the hotspot is expected. Currently, atmospheric transport simulations by numerical models are developed for reproduction of the distribution. However, there are some uncertainties in the simulations. In the case of hotspot, accuracy of simulated precipitation have to be well considered because the hotspot seemed to be formed by wet deposition.\n We modified the stable isotope mode of Regional Spectral Model (IsoRSM) to enable to simulate the transport of the radioactive tracers, namely 131I and 137Cs, by including the dry and wet deposition processes. As the simplified data assimilation, simulated precipitation was replaced with Radar-AMeDAS precipitation data (RAP). RAP was assimilated in the post-process, after running simulations, to redistribute wet deposition of 137Cs. The ratio of 137Cs deposited from the cumulative vertical column with precipitation in the domain was not changed, however its pattern was redistributed corresponding with RAP and simulated concentration. As a result, the redistributed wet deposition was within factor 10 to 2 compared with the fallout data in Kanto region, and further data assimilation would be contributed. In addition, we found that due to the arrival time of the plume in the morning on 21st and the border time of daily observation data of fallout, validation result might be worse even though hourly distributions are well simulated.",

The i-AlCuFe quasicrystal was synthesized in laboratory from a powder mixture with an atomic ratio of Al : Cu : Fe = 65 : 20 : 15. The high-temperature and high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments were performed using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell system installed at BL10XU, SPring-8, Japan. The i-AlCuFe showed a characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern of quasicrystal. With only compression, the diffraction patterns of the i-AlCuFe were continued until 75 GPa. At a pressure of 87 GPa two small new peaks occurred and then kept up to the maximum pressure of 104 GPa in the study. The results indicate that the pressure-induced structural phase transition of the i-AlCuFe occurs above 87 GPa, and the structure of the i-AlCuFe remains unchanged at least up to 75 GPa. Under simultaneously high pressure and high temperature, on the other hand, the i-AlCuFe was readily transformed to crystalline phase. It can be characterized by an irreversible transformation process. The structure of the i-AlCuFe is therefore more affected by thermal metamorphism than by pressure metamorphism. The present high-pressure and high-temperature experiments clearly revealed the thermal and pressure stability of the i-AlCuFe quasicrystal which may help to explain the formation of the naturally occurring quasicrystal in the solar system.",

            "abstract": "Many waveform inversion algorithms have been proposed in order to construct subsurface velocity structures from seismic data sets. These algorithms have suffered from computational burden, local minima problems, and the lack of low-frequency components. Computational efficiency can be improved by the application of back-propagation techniques and advances in computing hardware. In addition, waveform inversion algorithms, for obtaining long-wavelength velocity models, could avoid both the local minima problem and the effect of the lack of low-frequency components in seismic data. In this study, we proposed spectrogram inversion as a technique for recovering long-wavelength velocity models. In spectrogram inversion, decomposed frequency components from spectrograms of traces, in the observed and calculated data, are utilized to generate traces with reproduced low-frequency components. Moreover, since each decomposed component can reveal the different characteristics of a subsurface structure, several frequency components were utilized to analyze the velocity features in the subsurface.\nWe performed the spectrogram inversion using a modified SEG/SEGE salt A-A' line. Numerical results demonstrate that spectrogram inversion could also recover the long-wavelength velocity features. However, inversion results varied according to the frequency components utilized. Based on the results of inversion using a decomposed single-frequency component, we noticed that robust inversion results are obtained when a dominant frequency component of the spectrogram was utilized. In addition, detailed information on recovered long-wavelength velocity models was obtained using a multi-frequency component combined with single-frequency components. Numerical examples indicate that various detailed analyses of long-wavelength velocity models can be carried out utilizing several frequency components.",

While a number of NMR studies for the structure of multi-component silicate glasses and melts including basaltic and andesitic glasses have been reported (e.g., Park and Lee, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 2012, 80, 125; Park and Lee, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 2014, 26, 42), many challenges still remain. The composition of multi-component basaltic melts vary with temperature, pressure, and melt fraction (Kushiro, Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci., 2001, 71, 107). Especially, the eutectic point (the composition of first melt) of nepheline-forsterite-quartz (the simplest model of basaltic melts) moves with pressure from silica-saturated to highly undersaturated and alkaline melts. The composition of basaltic melts generated by partial melting of upper mantle peridotite (KLB-1, the xenolith from Kilbourne Hole) also vary with pressure. In this study we report experimental results for the effects of composition on the atomic structure of Na2O-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (NMAS) glasses in nepheline (NaAlSiO4)-forsterite (Mg2SiO4)-quartz (SiO2) eutectic composition and basaltic glasses generated by partial melting of upper mantle peridotite (KLB-1) using high-resolution multi-nuclear solid-state NMR. The Al-27 3QMAS (triple quantum magic angle spinning) NMR spectra of NMAS glasses in nepheline-forsterite-quartz eutectic composition show only [4]Al. The Al-27 3QMAS NMR spectra of KLB-1 basaltic glasses show mostly [4]Al and a non-negligible fraction of [5]Al. The fraction of [5]Al, the degree of configurational disorder, increases from 0 at XMgO [MgO/(MgO+Al2O3)]=0.55 to ~3% at XMgO=0.79 in KLB-1 basaltic glasses while only [4]Al are observed in nepheline-forsterite-quartz eutectic composition. The current experimental results provide that the fraction of [5]Al abruptly increases by the effect of composition as well as pressure in natural silicate melts. The changes of the fraction of highly coordinated Al in multi-component silicate glasses and melts with composition can provide insight into the changes of macroscopic properties (e.g., entropy, viscosity, and diffusivity) with varying composition of melt.",

            "abstract": "Adaptation to climate change requires redesigning our landscapes and watersheds to maximize ecological resilience at large scales and integrated across urban areas, wildlands, and a diversity of ecosystem types. However, it can be difficult for environmental managers and designers to access, interpret, and apply resilience concepts at meaningful scales and across a range of settings. To address this gap, we produced a Landscape Resilience Framework that synthesizes the latest science on the qualitative mechanisms that drive resilience of ecological functions to climate change and other large-scale stressors. The framework is designed to help translate resilience science into actionable ecosystem conservation and restoration recommendations and adaptation strategies by providing a concise but comprehensive list of considerations that will help integrate resilience concepts into urban design, conservation planning, and natural resource management.\nThe framework is composed of seven principles that represent core attributes which determine the resilience of ecological functions within a landscape. These principles are: setting, process, connectivity, redundancy, diversity/complexity, scale, and people. For each principle we identify several key operationalizable components that help illuminate specific recommendations and actions that are likely to contribute to landscape resilience for locally appropriate species, habitats, and biological processes. We are currently using the framework to develop landscape-scale recommendations for ecological resilience in the heavily urbanized Silicon Valley, California, in collaboration with local agencies, companies, and regional experts. The resilience framework is being applied across the valley, including urban, suburban, and wildland areas and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Ultimately, the framework will underpin the development of strategies that can be implemented to bolster ecological resilience from a site to landscape scale.",

            "abstract": "As with conventional wisdom about snowflakes, we would expect it unlikely that any two broadband seismograms would ever be exactly identical. However depending upon the resolution of our comparison metric, we do expect, and often find, bandpassed seismograms that correlate to very high levels (>0.99). In fact regional (e.g. Schaff and Richards, 2011) and global investigations (e.g. Dodge and Walter, 2015) find large numbers of highly correlated seismograms. Decreasing computational costs are increasing the tremendous potential for correlation in lowering detection, location and identification thresholds for explosion monitoring (e.g. Schaff et al., 2012, Gibbons and Ringdal, 2012; Zhang and Wen, 2015). We have shown in the case of Source Physics Experiment (SPE) chemical explosions, templates at local and near regional stations can detect, locate and identify very small explosions, which might be applied to monitoring active test sites (Ford and Walter, 2015).\nIn terms of elastic theory, seismograms are the convolution between source and Green function terms. Thus high correlation implies similar sources, closely located. How do we quantify this physically? For example it is well known that as the template event and target events are increasingly separated spatially, their correlation diminishes, as the difference in the Green function between the two events grows larger. This is related to the event separation in terms of wavelength, the heterogeneity of the Earth structure, and the time-bandwidth of the correlation parameters used, but this has not been well quantified. We are using the historic dataset of nuclear explosions in southern Nevada to explore empirically where and how well these events correlate as a function of location, depth, size, time-bandwidth and other parameters. A goal is to develop more meaningful and physical metrics that go beyond the correlation coefficient and can be applied to explosion monitoring problems, particularly event identification.",

            "abstract": "Results of a series of analogue models, and both scanned data and sections of natural landslides are used to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of the 3D internal structures during the collapse of granular slopes. Model results show that the collapse of granular slopes results in formation of different-generation normal faults in the rear of the failure mass and shortening structures in the front of the failure mass. The first-generation, steep normal faults (dipping about 60º) cut across the entire stratigraphy of the slope, and involve the bulk volume of the failure mass. In contrast, the later-generation normal faults (dipping about 40º) cut only across the shallow units, and involve less amount of the failure mass. These faults differ also in amount of displacement they accommodate. Results of homogeneous slope models show that later-generation faults accommodate significantly larger displacement than the first-generation faults. In contrast, results of non-homogeneous slope models embedding a weak horizon show that, the first-generation faults, which form within the weak horizon, accommodate significantly larger displacement than the later-generation faults. In other words, sliding is facilitated along the first-generation faults in the presence of a weak horizon. Beds rotate along these different-generation faults. Analysis of model results show that stratigraphically deeper beds rotate more than shallow ones. Our field observations confirm the presence of at least two generations of failure surfaces where the older ones, which are cut by the gentler ones, are steeper. Sections through natural slides show some of the key features observed in the toe of the model slopes. Model results also show that the failure mass deforms not only in the dip direction, but also in the strike direction. More normal faults generate within the middle section of the failure mass, whereas more shortening structures generate within the side sections of the failure mass. Within the seemingly chaotic structural pattern of the failure mass, superimposed structures are observed in front of the failure mass. These structures include faulted folds, folded fault surfaces, refolded folds and displaced fault surfaces.\nKeywords: Granular slopes; faults; folds; Analogue models; Natural landslides",

            "abstract": "We monitor seafloor crustal deformation at two observation points (south and north of Nankai Trough (TOA and TCA)) across the Nankai Trough, Japan, from 2013 to 2015. A ocean current flows frequently above our points called the Kuroshio current that has temperature difference perpendicular to the flow axis down to 1000 m in depths. Sound speed in the water depends on temperature (Del Grosso, 1974). Determination of seafloor benchmark position (SBP) has a bias when the sound speed structure includes a horizontal inhomogeneity (HI) in large-scale ocean current area. This bias is caused by trade-off between estimated spatial-temporal variation of sound speed structure and SBP. In this study, we propose a new observation system and analytical method, which directly observe the HI of sound speed derived from Underway CTD (UCTD) measurement and we introduce the HI to analytical method. We performed the observation in May 2015. We measured acoustic ranging during marine navigation on a circle with radius of 2 miles. At the same time, we observed six UCTD measurements down to 700 m in depths at both points. We use analytical method of Ikuta et al. (2008) for determination of SBP and adopt estimated HI of sound speed structure from UCTD measurements. We use the following equation to adopt the HI model: S(t,x,X)=S(t)+∆S(R(X)+ar(x,X)), where S(t,x,X) is the spatial-temporal variation of slowness but spatial variation is the uniform during the observation period, S(t) is the estimated temporal variation of sound speed structure following Ikuta et al. (2008), ∆S is the horizontal gradient of slowness estimated from UCTD measurement, R(x) is the distance of a ship from center of three SBPs, r(x,X) is the distance between ship position and benchmark position, a is the ratio of layer of HI for the whole depth, x is the ship position, and X is the benchmark position. SBP adopted the HI model is determined 74.9 cm toward N17.4˚E at TCA and 90.0 cm toward N7.8˚E at TOA. The direction of the displacements are consistent with the estimated HI axis derived from UCTD measurement and the value of the displacements are the same order of magnitude as Muto et al. (2008). RMS of traveltime residual decreases from 0.089 to 0.052 ms at TCA and from 0.108 to 0.099ms at TOA. In this result, we improve precision of SBP in the large-scale ocean current area.",

            "abstract": "Amino acid racemization (AAR) is widely used as a cost-effective method to date molluscs in time-averaging and taphonomic studies, but it has not been attempted for echinoderms despite their paleobiological importance. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of AAR geochronology in Holocene aged Peronella peronii (Echinodermata: Echinoidea) collected from Sydney Harbour (Australia). Using standard HPLC methods we determined the extent of AAR in 74 Peronella tests and performed replicate analyses on 18 tests. We sampled multiple areas of two individuals and identified the outer edge as a good sampling location. Multiple replicate analyses from the outer edge of 18 tests spanning the observed range of D/Ls yielded median coefficients of variation < 4% for Asp, Phe, Ala, and Glu D/L values, which overlaps with the analytical precision. Correlations between D/L values across 155 HPLC injections sampled from 74 individuals are also very high (pearson r2 > 0.95) for these four amino acids. The ages of 11 individuals spanning the observed range of D/L values were determined using 14C analyses, and Bayesian model averaging was used to determine the best AAR age model. The averaged age model was mainly composed of time-dependent reaction kinetics models (TDK, 71%) based on phenylalanine (Phe, 94%). Modelled ages ranged from 14 to 5539 yrs, and the median 95% confidence interval for the 74 analysed individuals is ±28% of the modelled age. In comparison, the median 95% confidence interval for the 11 calibrated 14C ages was ±9% of the median age estimate. Overall Peronella yields exceptionally high-quality AAR D/L values and appears to be an excellent substrate for AAR geochronology. This work opens the way for time-averaging and taphonomic studies of echinoderms similar to those in molluscs.",

            "abstract": "Many hypotheses have been proposed for origin of seismic anisotropy in the Earth's inner core which consists of solid metal. Plastic deformation of constituent material (most probably hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) iron) is one of the candidate processes to form the inner core anisotropy. Thus knowledge of deformation-induced lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of hcp-iron is important for understanding of nature of the inner core. In this study, we have carried out shear deformation experiments on hcp-iron and determined its deformation induced LPO. Since it is impossible to recover hcp-iron to ambient condition, both deformation and measurement of LPO have to be done at high-pressure conditions. Shear deformation experiments of hcp-iron were carried out using a deformation-DIA apparatus at high-pressure and high-temperature condition where hcp-iron is stable (9–18 GPa, 723 K). Development of LPO in the deforming sample was observed in-situ based on two-dimensional X-ray diffraction using an imaging plate detector and monochromatized synchrotron X-ray. In shear deformation of hcp-iron, <0001> and <112‾0> axes gradually aligned to be sub-parallel to shear plane normal and shear direction, respectively, from initial random orientation. The <0001> and <112‾0> axes are back-rotated from shear direction by ~30°. The above results suggest basal slip <112‾0>{0001} is the dominant slip system under the studied deformation conditions. It has been shown that Earth’s inner core has an axisymmetric anisotropy with P-wave traveling ~3% faster along polar paths than along equatorial directions. Although elastic anisotropy of hcp-iron at the inner core conditions is still controversial, recent theoretical studies consistently shows that P-wave velocity of hcp-iron is fastest along <0001> direction at least at low-temperatures. Our experimental results could be suggesting that most part of the inner core deforms with shear plane sub-parallel to equatorial plane.",

In order to monitor shoreline changes due to coastal erosion, remote sensing techniques are being utilized. The land-cover map classifies the physical material on the surface of the earth, and it can be utilized in establishing eco-policy and land-use policy.\nIn this study, we analyzed the correlation between land-use changes around the Nakdong River and shoreline changes at Busan Dadaepo Beach adjacent to the river. We produced the land-cover map based on the guidelines published by the Ministry of Environment Korea, using eight Landsat satellite images obtained from 1984 to 2015. To observe land use changes around the Nakdong River, the study site was set to include the surroundings areas of the Busan Dadaepo Beach, the Nakdong River as well as its estuary, and also Busan New Port. For the land-use classification of the study site, we also produced a land-cover map divided into seven categories according to the Ministry of Environment, Korea guidelines and using the most accurate Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). Land use changes inland, at 500m from the shoreline, were excluded for the correlation analysis between land use changes and shoreline changes. The other categories, except for the water category, were transformed into numerical values and the land-use classifications, using all other categories, were analyzed. Shoreline changes were observed by setting the base-line and three cut-lines.\nWe assumed that longshore bars around the Nakdong River and the shoreline of the Busan Dadaepo Beach are affected. Therefore, we expect that shoreline changes happen due to the influence of barren land, wetlands, built-up areas and deposition. The causes are due to natural factors, such as weather, waves, tide currents, longshore currents, and also artificial factors such as coastal structures, construction, and dredging.",

In the meridional direction, the interhemispheric asymmetry of black carbon manifests in a weakening of the DJF Hadley cell, but not a strengthening in the JJA Hadley cell, possibly a result of the global convective mass flux constraint.

MJO activities are strengthened over the western Pacific during the pre-developing and developing phases of EP El Niño, but they are suppressed in the mature and decaying phases. In contrast, MJO activities over the western Pacific have little relationship with CP El Niño before its occurrence, but increased over central Pacific during its mature and decaying phases. Lag correlation analyses further confirm that MJO activities over the western Pacific in boreal spring and early summer are closely related to EP El Niño up to 2-11 months later, but not to CP El Niño. EP El Niño tends to weaken the MJO and make its eastwards propagation range shorter. Anomalous descending motions over the Maritime Continent and equatorial western Pacific induced by El Niño decrease convection and moisture convergence in these areas, and lead to the weakened MJO activities during the mature phase of El Niño. The MJO activities are much weaker in EP El Niño due to the stronger anomalous descending motions in EP El Niño. Furthermore, the MJO propagates further eastward during CP El Niño because of robust moisture convergence in the central Pacific which provides adequate moisture for the development of MJO convection there.",

However, the temporal continuity of the products is affected by the updating or replacement of passive microwave sensors or satellite platforms.

Then, we evaluated the consistency of the snow cover area (SCA) and snow depth derived from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), SSM/I and SSMI/S. The results indicated that (1) the spatial pattern of the SCA derived from the SMMR and SSM/I data was more consistent after calibration than before; (2) the relative biases in the SCA and snow depth in China between the SSM/I and SSMI/S data decreased from 42.42% to 1.65% and from 66.18% to -1.5%, respectively; and (3) the SCA and snow depth derived from the SSM/I data carried on F08, F11 and F13 were highly consistent. The relative bias of SCA and snow depth between F08 and F11 were -5.8% and -3.73%, respectively, and they are 3.31% and 1.85% between F13 and F11. To obtain consistent snow depth and SCA products, inter-sensor calibrations between SMMR, SSM/I and SSMI/S are important. In consideration of the snow data product continuation, we suggest that the brightness temperature data from all sensors be calibrated based on SSMI/S.",

            "abstract": "Fully Lagrangian methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) have been widely used to solve the continuum and particles motions in the computational geodynamics field. These mesh-free methods are suitable for the problems with the complex geometry and boundary. In addition, their Lagrangian nature allows non-diffusive advection useful for tracking history dependent properties (e.g. rheology) of the material. These potential advantages over the mesh-based methods offer effective numerical applications to the geophysical flow and tectonic processes, which are for example, tsunami with free surface and floating body, magma intrusion with fracture of rock, and shear zone pattern generation of granular deformation.\nIn order to investigate such geodynamical problems with the particle based methods, over millions to billion particles are required for the realistic simulation. Parallel computing is therefore important for handling such huge computational cost. An efficient parallel implementation of SPH and DEM methods is however known to be difficult especially for the distributed-memory architecture. Lagrangian methods inherently show workload imbalance problem for parallelization with the fixed domain in space, because particles move around and workloads change during the simulation. Therefore dynamic load balance is key technique to perform the large scale SPH and DEM simulation.\nIn this work, we present the parallel implementation technique of SPH and DEM method utilizing dynamic load balancing algorithms toward the high resolution simulation over large domain using the massively parallel super computer system. Our method utilizes the imbalances of the executed time of each MPI process as the nonlinear term of parallel domain decomposition and minimizes them with the Newton like iteration method. In order to perform flexible domain decomposition in space, the slice-grid algorithm is used. Numerical tests show that our approach is suitable for solving the particles with different calculation costs (e.g. boundary particles) as well as the heterogeneous computer architecture. We analyze the parallel efficiency and scalability on the super computer systems (K-computer, Earth simulator 3, etc.).",

The weak, deep crust flows toward the pull-apart region to isostatically compensate the stretching and thinning of the upper crust. In contrast, the velocity field in the upper crust remains parallel to the imposed direction of extension. In the pull-apart region a transdome, made of two parallel foliation folds (or sub-domes), forms. In the dome, fabrics evolve from strong vertical flattening in between the two sub-domes, to shallow dipping constriction roughly parallel to the direction of extension in the upper part of the transdome.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is an ongoing collisional mountain belt located in the conjunction of two subduction-arc systems with opposite vergences between the Philippine Sea and Eurasian plates. The Coastal Range along the eastern Taiwan is the accreted Luzon arcs and surrounding basins onto the Eurasian crust. The Chimei fault, a typical lithology-contrast fault thrusting the Miocene volcanic Tuluanshan Formation over the Pleistocene sedimentary Paliwan Formation, is the only major reverse fault across the entire Coastal Range. To investigate the deformation pattern and strain history across the Chimei fault, we analyzed oriented samples of mudstone and volcanic rocks across the fault zone, fold zone, damage zone, and wall rocks along the Hsiukuluan River via anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS).\nAMS can be represented as a susceptibility ellipsoid with 3 principal directions and values (Kmax, Kint, Kmin) and therefore is well known as a tool of magnetic fabrics to study the deformation. Results of AMS across the central part of the Chimei fault show that the direction of Kmax changed from N-S orientation to sub-vertical and the orientation of Kmin switched from 270/70 to N-S orientation when samples were closed to the fault zone. At the same time, anisotropy was increasing and susceptibility ellipsoid changed from oblate to prolate in the fold zone back to oblate in the fault zone. Based on identification works of magnetic minerals, the major magnetic carrier is magnetite with pseudo-single domain. As a result, it strongly speculated when samples were approaching to the central part of Chimei fault, stress altered from sub-vertical sedimentary loading to horizontally N-S tectonic compression. Due to increasing deformation, oblate ellipsoids with strong anisotropy developed within the fault zone highlighted the strain history of the central part of the Chimei fault.",

Information about the model is now available on the CE website. The program model has evolved from more than 12 years of experience, building with input from strong leaders and participants. CE offers face-to-face, virtual, and hybrid events, and features a rich website that supports these professional development events as well as a growing community with a shared interest in effective geoscience teaching. Data from national surveys, participant feedback, and self-report data indicate the program’s success in improving undergraduate geoscience education. Successes are also demonstrated in classroom observations using RTOP, indicating a significant difference in teaching style among participants and non-participants.\nA suite of web pages, with a planning timeline, provides guidance to those interested in designing and convening face-to-face or virtual events based on the CE model. The pages suggest ways to develop robust event goals and evaluation tools, how to choose strong leaders and recruit diverse participants, advice for designing effective event programs that utilize participant expertise, websites, and web tools, and suggestions for effectively disseminating event results and producing useful products. The CE model has been successfully transferred to projects that vary in scale and discipline.\nBest practices from the CE model include (1) thinking of the workshop as shared enterprise among conveners and participants; (2) incorporating conveners and participants who bring diverse viewpoints and approaches; (3) promoting structured discussions that utilize participants’ expertise; (4) emphasizing practical strategies to effect change; and (5) using the website as a platform to prepare for the workshop, share ideas, and problem-solve challenges.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric ice particles play a significant role in many atmospheric processes and are central to the role of clouds in determining the global radiative balance. Atmospheric ice originates when Ice Nucleating Particles (INP) lower the free energy barrier to phase transformation. The Earth's polar regions are well isolated from the middle and lower latitudes and thus have limited access to INP, and therefore small changes in terms of regional sources or large scale transport of particulate may have significant impacts on polar ice cloud formation. Here we describe field measurements of INP collected in the Port of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. The port is the largest Scandinavian seaport and thus has heavy and diverse ocean vessel traffic. Unique to this study was the ability to isolate the INP contribution directly from the ship traffic by utilizing a sampling method that nearly simultaneously captured transiting ship plumes and the background aerosol. A small but potentially significant increase in IN from marine vessels was observed over two consecutive years. The results have implications for Arctic and global climate in the context of growing global commerce and trans-polar transport.",

            "abstract": "The Troodos ophiolite in Cyprus includes two orthogonal structures – the NS-striking Solea graben and the EW-striking Arakapas fault – that form a ridge-transform intersection. Sheeted dikes and gabbros are preserved on both the inside and outside corners providing a view of mid-crustal deformation in the system. We examine and model these patterns of deformation using existing map and paleomagnetic data combined with new rock magnetic data.\nThe inside corner of the system has been well studied. The most notable feature is the changing orientation of sheeted dikes, which shift from NW- to NE- to E-striking with increasing proximity to the Arakapas fault. Paleomagnetic data from many studies, including our own, show declination anomalies that vary with distance from the ridge and the transform. The three principal axes from anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) ellipsoids in the gabbros seem to be correlated with local sheeted dike orientations.\nThe outside corner of the system has been less well studied. Sheeted dike orientations change more subtly; many are NS-striking and dip towards the Solea Graben, but near the inferred ridge-transform intersection, they are NNE-striking. Our new paleomagnetic data from 26 sites record declination and inclination anomalies that vary spatially within the outside corner. AMS data from the gabbros and sheeted dikes again seem loosely linked to sheeted dike orientations.\nTo summarize, the structural and rock magnetic results on either side of the Solea Graben are distinct, confirming the idea that these rocks formed on different sides of a ridge-transform system. The paleomagnetic data yield insights about the styles of deformation following crystallization. The AMS data may yield insights about magmatic plumbing systems when combined systematically with paleomagnetic results. Our results from the outside corner show that patterns of deformation can be complex even on the non-plate boundary side of a ridge-transform system.",

            "abstract": "Water is an essential factor of agricultural production. Agriculture, in turn, is globalized through the trade of food commodities. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model of a small open economy that explicitly incorporates water resources. The model emphasizes three tradeoffs involving water decision-making that are important yet not always considered within the existing literature. One tradeoff focuses on competition for water among different sectors when there is a shock to one of the sectors only, such as trade liberalization and consequent higher demand for the product. A second tradeoff concerns the possibility that there may or may not be substitutes for water, such as increased use of sophisticated irrigation technology as a means to increase crop output in the absence of higher water availability. A third tradeoff explores the possibility that the rest of the world can be a source of supply or demand for a country's water-using products. A number of propositions are proven. For example, while trade liberalization tends to increase water use, increased pressure on water supplies can be moderated by way of a tax that is derivable with observable economic phenomena. Another example is that increased riskiness of water availability tends to cause water users to use less water than would be the case under profit maximization. These theoretical model results generate hypotheses that can be tested empirically in future work.",

However, the physiological mechanisms that drive this response are limited by primarily infrequent and small-scale leaf-level measurements. Here, we integrated eddy covariance flux tower estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) across an elevation-gradient in California with airborne imagery from the NASA HyspIRI Preparatory campaign to evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imagery to detect responses of GPP to prolonged drought. We observed a number of spectral features in the visible, infrared, and shortwave infrared regions that yielded stronger linkages than traditional broadband indices with space and time variation in GPP across a range of ecosystems in California experiencing water stress in the past three years. Further, partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling offers the ability to generate predictive models of GPP from narrowband hyperspectral remote sensing that directly links plant chemistry and spectral properties to productivity, and could serve as a significant advance over broadband remote sensing of GPP anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Significant researches have recently been conducted regarding the spatiotemporal change in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in a river system throughout the world. It is of great important for quantification regional erosion severity and their dependencies with impact factors. SSC in rivers is highly variable in time and space, reflecting both variations in river discharge and in the suspended sediment supply. The Yarlung Zangbo River is the longest river in Tibetan Plateau and the highest river in the world. The high water drop and topography variability in the river basin inevitably leads to significant different river morphology and hydrological and sediment processes from upstream to downstream. The study of suspended sediment in Yarlung Zangbo River has been a highlighting problem in Tibetan Plateau wide study of sediment yields. In this study, we analyze temporal changes and spatial distributions in suspended sediment runoff using daily observation data from different sections in the river. The temporal processes show that as increasing of annual precipitation and temperature along the downstream direction, as well as main tributaries feeding in along the reaches, the discharge and SSC generally show more peaks, more fluctuated, and larger span for both rising and falling processes. Spatially, the river discharge as well runoff depth significantly increases along the downstream direction. The highest runoff depth in the downstream is 6 times than that in the upstream area; which is dominated by greatly increasing runoff amount from precipitation and melting water. The high erosion intensity occurred in middle reaches, as a center of intensive human activities and then after middle reach there is a deposition area. The erosion severity in the Yarlung Zangbo River, on the whole, is at a relative low level. Keywords: Yarlung Zangbo River, suspended sediment transport, soil erosion, Tibetan Plateau",

Starting at 02:00 UT, the prominence began to rise slowly. About two hours later, we observed tornado-like horizontal motions as high as 150 Mm above the limb, which were associated with the heating of the dark prominence into brightening material in AIA 17.1 nm. Interactions between the prominence and the overlying coronal loops resulted in the downflows of the prominence material along the loops back to the solar surface, with the landing sites of the downflowing material moving sequentially away from the prominence channel. This could result from magnetic reconnections between the prominence field and the overlying field, which proceeded to higher and higher altitudes when the reconnections encroached into the overlying field. Helical motions at low altitudes are interpreted as flows along the twisted field that supported the prominence against the gravity in its quiescent state. A localized flux emergence within a nearby active region is considered as the trigger the tornado.",

            "abstract": "Continents are regions that ride near or above sea-level. Today, the continents are underlain by at least 30 km of felsic crust, under which lies cold peridotitic mantle lithosphere that can extend to depths of 200 km in the oldest cores of continents. Making large amounts of felsic magmas requires crystal fractionation from hydrous parental basaltic magmas. Hydrous parental magmas require water to be introduced into the mantle, presumably by subduction. One place where felsic continental crust is being formed is in continental arcs. As basaltic magmas rise upwards through the cold thermal boundary layer, they cool, crystallize and fractionate, resulting in felsic magmas rising towards the surface and more mafic cumulates remaining at depth. We show that the shallow magma chambers that give rise to dacitic to rhyolitic eruptions are actually felsic cumulates with 30% trapped melt. Mafic cumulates exist in the lower crust and in the lithospheric mantle, with lesser amounts of trapped melt. Active continental arcs should be characterized by partially molten mushes at intermediate crustal depths (30 % trapped melt), at the Moho, and just below the Moho (<10% melt) and should thus give distinct seismic signals. After crystallization, most mafic cumulates will have velocities comparable to or greater than that of peridotite. However, the most primitive cumulates, which form beneath the Moho, may have velocities less than peridotite, resulting in long-lived low velocity layers within the lithospheric mantle. Finally, we show that elevations of mountain belts correlate well with crustal thickness, indicating that the isostatic compensation of mountains is controlled by the crust. This suggests that beneath thickened crust, the lithospheric mantle is thin and does not contribute to topography. Craton elevations, however, are lower than that predicted by their crustal thicknesses, requiring sub-Moho mass excess. While peridotitic mantle underlying cratons are chemically buoyant, the anomalously low elevations suggests that cratons are underlain by thick thermal boundary layers, whose negative thermal buoyancy slightly exceeds the chemical buoyancy. Alternatively, high density rocks, such as cumulate pyroxenites formed during continent formation, may reside within the cratonic mantle, increasing its density.",

            "abstract": "During an earthquake, seismic slip and frictional heating may cause the physical and chemical alterations of magnetic minerals within the fault zone. Rock magnetism provides a method for understanding earthquake dynamics. The Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling Project (WFSD) started right after 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, to investigate the earthquake faulting mechanism. Hole 2 (WFSD-2) is located in the Pengguan Complex in the Bajiaomiao village (Dujiangyan, Sichuan), and reached the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (YBF). We measured the surface magnetic susceptibility of the cores in WFSD-2 from 500 m to 1530 m with an interval of 1 cm. Rocks at 500-599.31 m-depth and 1211.49-1530 m-depth are from the Neoproterozoic Pengguang Complex while the section from 599.31 m to 1211.49 m is composed of Late Triassic sediments. The magnetic susceptibility values of the first part of the Pengguan Complex range from 1 to 25 × 10-6 SI, while the second part ranges from 10 to 200 × 10-6 SI, which indicate that the two parts are not from the same rock units. The Late Triassic sedimentary rocks have a low magnetic susceptibility values, ranging from -5 to 20 × 10-6 SI. Most fault zones coincide with the high value of magnetic susceptibility in the WFSD-2 cores. Fault rocks, mainly fault breccia, cataclasite, gouge and pseudotachylite within the WFSD-2 cores, and mostly display a significantly higher magnetic susceptibility than host rocks (5:1 to 20:1). In particular, in the YBF zone of the WFSD-2 cores (from 600 to 960 m), dozens of stages with high values of magnetic susceptibility have been observed. The multi-layered fault rocks with high magnetic susceptibility values might indicate that the YBF is a long-term active fault. The magnetic susceptibility values change with different types of fault rocks. The gouge and pseudotachylite have higher values of magnetic susceptibility than other fault rocks. Other primary rock magnetism analyses were then performed to investigate the mechanisms. We consider that the principal mechanism for the high magnetic susceptibility of these fault rocks is most likely the production of new magnetite from iron-bearing paramagnetic minerals (such as silicates or clays). These new magnetites might originate from frictional heating on a seismic fault slip plane or seismic fluid during an earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The direction of fast horizontal shear wave velocity (FSH direction) is used as an indicator of the direction of maximum horizontal principal stress. However, the wave velocity anisotropy will be simultaneously dominated by the stress induced anisotropy and the inherent anisotropy which includes the effects of sedimentary and tectonic structures. In this study, the influence factors of wave velocity anisotropy will be analyzed in borehole-A of Taiwan Chelungpu-Fault Drilling Project (TCDP). The anisotropic compliance tensors of intact sandstones and mudrocks derived from the laboratory wave measurement are combined with the equivalent continuous model to evaluate the compliance tensor of jointed rock mass. Results show the lithology was identified as the most influential factor on the wave velocity anisotropy. Comparing the FSH direction logging data with our results, the wave velocity anisotropy in sandstones is mostly caused by inherent anisotropy of intact sandstones. The spatial variations of wave velocity anisotropy in mudrocks is caused by other relatively higher influence factors than inherent anisotropy of intact mudrocks. In addition, the dip angle of bedding plans is also important for wave velocity anisotropy of mudrocks because the FSH direction logging data seems dominated by the dip direction of bedding planes when the dip angle becomes steeper (at the depth greater than 1785 m). Surprisingly, the wave velocity anisotropy contributed by joints that we determined by equivalent continuous model is not significant. In this study, based on the TCDP borehole data, we conclude that determining the direction of maximum horizontal principal stress from the FSH directions should consider the influence of inherent anisotropy on rock mass.",

            "abstract": "Weather-determined regional day-to-day variability is a major pattern for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other air pollutants over eastern China. This variability is largely non-periodic, compared to its diurnal cycle, posing a difficulty for traditional periodicity-based spatiotemporal analysis. Here, we combine the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) and the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) analyses to study spatiotemporal variations of ground-level NO2 (measured from more than 160 urban or suburban sites) and its association with meteorological processes over Eastern China. We find that diurnal variation dominates in summer, being associated with diurnally varying photochemistry and PBL mixing strength. In winter, day-to-day variability clearly exhibits, as governed by the weather system, mostly by the passage of clean and cold air from the north.\nWe further diagnose the scale-dependent processes and evaluate how well current chemical transport models can capture these processes and resulting NO2 variations. We perform the EOF-EEMD analysis on GEOS-Chem and CMAQ simulations in winter. Both models cannot reproduce the observed day-to-day variation very well. CMAQ exhibits stronger NO2 diurnal cycle than observed due to too strong variability in PBL mixing. Specifically, its PBL mixing is too strong in the daytime and too weak at night, leading to an underestimate of NO2 by about 10 ppb in the day but an overestimate by ~10 ppb at night. Other Analyses are still ongoing.",

            "abstract": "Sea-salt aerosol (SSA) emissions have a significant impact on aerosol pollution and haze formation in the coastal areas. In this study, Models-3/CMAQ modeling system was utilized to access the impact of SSA emissions on aerosol chemical formation and deposition over Pearl River Delta (PRD), China in July 2006. More SSAs were transported inland from the open-ocean under the southeast wind in summertime. Two experiments (with and without SSA emissions in the CMAQ model) were set up to compare the modeling results with each other. The results showed that the increase of sulfate concentrations were more attributable to the primary emissions of coarse SO42- particles in SSA, while the increase of nitrate concentrations were more attributable to secondary chemical formations, known as the mechanisms of chloride depletion in SSA. In the coastal areas, 17.62 % of SO42-, 26.6% of NO3- and 38.2% of PM10 were attributed to SSA emissions, while those portions were less than 1% in the inland areas. The increases of PM10 and its components due to SSA emissions resulted in higher deposition fluxes over PRD, particularly in the coastal areas, except for the wet deposition of nitrate. Nitrate was more sensitive to SSA emissions in chemical formations than sulfate and dry deposition of aerosol was also more sensitive than that for wet deposition. Process analysis of sulfate and nitrate was applied to find out the difference of physical and chemical mechanisms between Guangzhou (the inland areas) and Zhuhai (the coastal areas). The negative contributions of dry deposition process to both sulfate and nitrate concentrations increased if SSA emissions were taken into account in the model, especially for Zhuhai. The negative contributions of cloud process also increased due to cloud scavenging and wet deposition process. In the coastal area, the gas-to-particle conversions became more active with high contributions of aerosol process to nitrate concentrations.",

            "abstract": "The fate of permafrost carbon is of great concern among global change community due to its potential positive feedback to climate warming. However, the determinants of soil carbon decomposition between active layer and permafrost layers remain poorly understood. This incubation study was designed to test the following two hypotheses: 1) low carbon quantity and microbial abundances in permafrost soils limit decomposition rates compared with active layer soils; 2) carbon losses from active layer are more controlled by environmental factors, whereas those from permafrost depth are primarily determined by the microbial condition. We collected five active layer and permafrost soils from alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau and compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at -5 and 5 °C in a 80-days aerobic incubation. The availability of organic carbon and microbial abundances (fungi, bacteria, and actinomycete) within permafrost soils were significantly lower than active layer soils, which, together with the environmental data supports the reduced cumulative CO2 emissions in permafrost depth. However, the decomposability of SOC from permafrost was similar or even higher than surface soils. The carbon loss not only depended on SOC quantity and microbial abundance, but also nitrogen availability and soil pH. Nevertheless, the controls on carbon emissions between active and permafrost layers were significantly different. Cumulative CO2 emission from active layers was best predicted by soil moisture, and carbon emission from permafrost depths was highly associated with fungal-PLFAs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that different controls on carbon emission between active layer and permafrost soils. These differences highlight the importance of distinguishing permafrost depth in Earth System Models when predicting the responses of deep soil carbon to environmental change.",

Preliminary measurements of δ41K values indicate that seawater and silicate rocks are isotopically distinct reservoirs, with seawater having a δ41K value that is ~0.5‰ heavier than the silicate average (-0.5‰; Morgan et al., in prep). The heavy δ41K character of seawater might be related to 1) an isotopically enriched input flux (rivers and high-temperature hydrothermal reactions); or 2) a 41K-depleted sink associated with authigenic clay formation during low-temperature alteration of volcanic rocks. Here we present measurements of the δ41K values of pore-fluids from ODP site 1052 in order to constrain potassium isotope fractionation during secondary clay formation. We find that δ41K values and K concentrations both decline systematically with depth. Results from 1-D diffusion-advection-reaction modeling of potassium concentrations and isotopic compositions indicate that fractionation of K isotopes during diffusion (Bourg et al., 2010) can explain all of the change in δ41K values of the pore-fluid with depth. Although the size of the K sink at site 1052 is a trivial fraction of the global K sink in clay minerals, our results suggest that diffusive fractionation of K isotopes in shallow pore-fluids may be, in part, responsible for the elevated δ41K value of seawater.",

Good agreement between analytical, experimental and numerical results were obtained. The proposed siphon system was found to initiate the flow regardless the downstream valve is opened gradually or rapidly. However, small leakages may lead to air at atmospheric pressure to rush into the top of the siphon and stop the flow.

An enormous amount of carbon is also contained in the Earth’s interior, which suggests that silicate could be closely interacted with carbon under high-pressure and high-temperature (Sen et al. 2013, PNAS). It is suggested that carbon dioxide is dissolved in cristobalite and the average composition of CO2-SiO2 solid solution is C0.6(1)Si0.4(1)O2 High-pressure experiment (Santoro et al. 2014, Nat. Commun.). Furthermore, the first-principles calculations suggested the possibility of successive CO2 dissolution in cristobalite at ambient pressure (Aravindh et al. 2007, Solid State Commun.). However, CO2-SiO2 solid solution at ambient pressure has not confirmed in laboratory experiment. In this study, we mixed amorphous silica and amorphous carbon and synthesized CO2-SiO2 solid solution at high-temperature under ambient pressure. Powder amorphous silica and graphite was mixed together in the agate mill in order to be homogenized mixture. They were heated for 1300 ˚C, 3 days under ambient pressure. Then, the samples were quenched at room temperature. The samples of CO2-SiO2 solid solution were carefully examined by powder XRD, EPMA measurement, and so on. From the result of the powder XRD, the products were a-quartz. In this lecture, we report the quantity of carbon dissolved in a-quartz and its effect for the crystal structure of a-quartz in detail.",

No AA impact structure has ever been identified. ~12 ka after the AA tektite event came the Brunhes-Matuyama geomagnetic reversal, Earth’s most recent.\nIn 1986, Richard Muller’s paper “Geomagnetic Reversals from Impacts on the Earth” explained how a geologically rapid change of Earth’s crustal spin rate relative to the liquid core would upset its convective cellular dynamo structure, disrupting and dismantling Earth’s magnetic field.\nMuller proposed an impact-induced mini ice age to transport 10 meters of low- and mid-latitude sea into ice at the poles, changing the crustal polar moment of inertia and accelerating rotation relative to the core. Muller’s impact ice age is a weak point, but oblique cosmic impacts deliver tangential impulse directly.\nThe Carolina Bays are a depositional formation of high purity quartz sand, angular to subangular in grain texture, covering approximately 5% of the continental US, with an estimated volume of 1600 km3 over the east coastal plain and some of Nebraska. The bays themselves are depressions in the sand layer, expressed through depositional overburden. They range from a few hundred meters to several kilometers in scale.\nCarolina Bays are now characterized with LiDAR altimetry. Their alignment is systematic by latitude. They conform to 6 archetype ovoid shapes, easily derived using suborbital mechanics. This implies suborbital mechanics was a governor of their transport: the imprint is a snapshot of the emplacement process.\nSuborbital Analysis using co-aligned axes of 45,000 Carolina Bays indicates the ice sheet impact region was the Georgian Bay, across Lake Huron to Michigan’s Saginaw Bay. The average downrange distance of the sand equates to an imparted velocity and a linear impulse per the mass of the sand. This linear impulse applied over Earth’s radius gives a |Δω| the same order Muller predicted would be necessary, 0.03 cm/s at the core mantle boundary.\nIf the AA tektite impact was oblique, what other imprinted signatures may remain detectable, and where?",

            "abstract": "Active Galactic Nuclei, or AGN, are extremely luminous bodies that emit large quantities of light via accretion onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. This project investigated the relationship between color (ratio of dust emission to accretion disk emission) and magnitude of AGN in order to establish a predictive correlation between the two, similar to the relationship between the color and magnitude of stars seen in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This relationship will prove beneficial in creating a standard candle for determining interstellar distances between AGN bodies. Photometry data surrounding Type 1 Seyferts and quasars from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) were studied. Using this data, color-magnitude diagrams comparing the ratio of two wavelengths to the absolute magnitude of another were created. Overall, many of the diagrams created indicated a clear correlation between color and luminosity of AGN. Several of the diagrams, focused on portions of the visible and near infrared (NIR) wavelength bands, showed the strongest correlations. When the z-k bands were plotted against the absolute magnitude of the k band, specifically surrounding the bodies with redshifts between 0.1 and 0.15, a strong predictive relationship was seen, with a high slope (0.75) and R2 close to 1 (0.69). Additionally, the diagram comparing the i-j bands to the absolute magnitude of the j band, specifically surrounding the bodies with redshifts between 0.05 and 0.1, also demonstrated a strong predictive relationship with a high slope (0.64) and R2 close to 1 (0.58). These correlations have several real-world applications, as they help determine cosmic distances, and, resultantly, age of the bodies in the universe.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates buried pockmark features on the Chatham Rise through the analysis and interpretation of 2D seismic and Parasound data. The main objectives of this research are to establish what caused the formation of buried pockmarks on the Chatham Rise and to determine when the pockmarks were formed. The study area is located on the Western Chatham Rise, near the Canterbury Shelf off the East Coast of New Zealand. The pockmark fields were revealed through multibeam bathymetry data collected from surveys during the past 20 years.\nPreviously, the pockmarks on the Chatham Rise were thought to have been produced by the release of methane through gas hydrate dissociation. However, recent geochemical investigations showed no indication of methane in the sediment cores. Current hypotheses for the formation of the pockmarks include groundwater fluid flow and the release of CO2 modulated by CO2 hydrates.\nWe present the results of the spatial analysis of the pockmarks on the Western Chatham Rise and whether there are any links between the location of pockmark formation and regional geology. The structures of the pockmarks were investigated to determine how the features were formed. The spatial configuration of the pockmarks were analysed vertically for stacking and laterally for potential ties to specific horizons, particularly horizons associated with Milankovitch order climate cycles. Results show stacking and clustering of pockmarks around specific horizons and a depth window in the upper sediment in which pockmarks are formed.\n2D seismic data was interpreted to build a regional geology model, through relative stratigraphy from intersecting seismic lines through the survey area. This improves the current understanding of the stratigraphy along the Chatham Rise and Canterbury Shelf areas and places the pockmark field in a regional geologic context.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic emissions in China have been controlled for years to improve ambient air quality. However, severe haze events caused by atmospheric aerosols with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) have continued to occur, especially in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region. The Chinese government has set an ambitious goal to reduce urban PM2.5 concentrations by 25% in BTH by 2017 relative to the 2012 levels. Source apportionment (SA) is necessary to the development of the effective emission control strategies. In this work, the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) with the Particulate Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) is applied to the China domain for the years 2006 and 2013. Ambient surface concentrations of PM2.5 and its components are generally well reproduced. To quantify the contributions of each emission category or region to PM2.5 in BTH, the total emissions are divided into 7 emission categories and 11 source regions. The source contributions determined in this work are generally consistent with results from previous work. In 2013, the industrial (44%) and residential (27%) sectors are the dominant contributors to urban PM2.5 in BTH. The residential sector is the largest contributor in winter; the industry sector dominates in other seasons. A slight increasing trend (+3% for industry and +6% for residential) is found in 2013 relative to 2006, necessitating more attention to these two sectors. Local emissions make the largest contribution (40%–60%) for all receptors. Change of source contribution of PM2.5 in Beijing and northern Hebei are dominate by change of local emission. However, for Tianjin, and central and southern Hebei, change of meteorology condition are as important as change of emission, because regional inflow in these areas is more important than in Beijing and northern Hebei and can increase under unfavorable weather conditions, indicating a strong need for regional joint emission control efforts. The results in this study enhance the quantitative understanding of the source–receptor relationships and provide an important basis for policymaking to advance the control of PM2.5 pollution in China. Both sector-based and fuel-based source apportionment will be available to further improve the comparability with receptor model results.",

            "abstract": "Understandings of controlling mechanism on the style of volcanic explosion is one of the most important subject not only for volcanology but also for hazard mitigation. Vesiculation, outgassing and crystallization of magma, and interaction with external water have been considered as essential factors for the controlling mechanism (e.g., Houghton and Gonnerman, 2005). In contrast, recent studies suggested that vigorous recyclings of pyroclast into the vent occur at basaltic volcanoes with repeating small explosions (D'Oriano et al., 2014). The recycling of pyroclast that fills the shallow conduit can affect explosion dynamics such as shape and ejection speed of jet cloud (e.g., Ohba et al., 2002).\nThis study examined component, texture and chemical composition of ash samples collected during normal activity at Stromboli to discuss a controlling mechanism of small explosion styles in basaltic volcano. During studied term (14:26-18:29, May 21th, 2014), ash-rich explosion occurred in NE crater, and ash-poor explosion occurred in the central and SW craters. We performed real-time collection of falling ash every 4-18 minutes. The real-time collection permits direct comparison of the ash samples with explosion activity. We classify the ash particles into Juvenile (glassy particles having similar composition with HP magma), Recycled (similar texture with reheated basaltic ash; D'Oriano et al., 2013), Altered, and Crystal particles. Bulk component of recycled particle calculated from componentry variations with grain size and grain size distribution shows that the volume fraction of recycled particles increases with ash falling rate at sampling site. The ash falling rate at sampling site increased after the occurrence of ash rich explosions at NE crater.\nOur ash observation indicates that burial of eruptive vent by recycled pyroclasts relates with occurrence of ash rich explosion at NE crater. Therefore, we suggest that combination of the amount of gas supplied from a deeper conduit and thickness of the buried sediment in the vent controls the style of small basaltic explosion in Stromboli (Burton et al., 2007; Patrick et al., 2007; Quane et al., 2009). Depositional structure of the vent determined by the pyroclast recycling and history of the explosions are important for understanding the explosion styles.",

Understanding the effects of these changes will be paramount in sustainably managing water resources, as well as maintaining associated capacity to provide ecosystem services (e.g., regulating flooding, maintaining instream flow during dry periods, cycling nutrients, and maintaining water quality). It will require better information characterizing both natural and human mediated hydrologic systems and enhanced ability to generate, manage, store, analyze, and share growing volumes of observational data. Over the past several years, a number of hydrology domain cyberinfrastructures have emerged or are currently under development that are focused on providing integrated access to and analysis of data for cross-domain synthesis studies.

            "abstract": "The wet season of the Australian monsoon is characterized by sub-seasonal periods of excessively wet or dry conditions, commonly know as monsoon bursts and breaks. This study is concerned with the synoptic evolution prior to monsoon bursts, which are defined here by abrupt transitions of the area-averaged rainfall over the tropical parts of the Australian continent. There is large variability in the number of monsoon bursts from year-to-year and in the time interval between consecutive monsoon bursts. Reanalysis data are used to construct a lag composite of the sequence of events prior to a monsoon burst. It is found that a burst in the Australian monsoon is preceded by the development of a well-defined extratropical wave packet in the Indian Ocean, which propagates toward the Australian continent in the few days leading up to the onset of heavy rainfall in the tropics. As in the case of previous studies on the monsoon onset, the extratropical disturbances propagate equatorward over the Australian continent. These extratropical systems are accompanied by lower tropospheric air mass boundaries, which also propagate into low latitudes. Ahead of these boundaries, relatively warm moist air is advected from the surrounding oceans, locally increasing the convective available potential energy. Commonly employed climate indices shows that monsoon bursts are more likely to occur when the active phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation is in the vicinity of Australia. Neither the El-Nino Southern Oscillation nor Southern Annular Mode have a significant effect on the occurrence of monsoon bursts.",

            "abstract": "The latitude specific monthly mean (LSMM) methane (CH4) mixing ratio in the Arctic region atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is established at 1.85 ppm (monitoring station at Barrow, Alaska, USA). This LSMM is about 10% higher than in Antarctica and about 5-7% higher than in the mid-latitudes, where the majority of anthropogenic activity occurs. So far, there is no reasonable explanation for the atmospheric CH4 maximum above the Arctic and no models have succeeded in satisfactorily reproducing the inter-polar gradient, due to the assumption that there are no Arctic region CH4 sources sufficient to serve year-round to maintain the existing maximum. The East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), from which extensive CH4 release was recently reported, has never been considered to be an atmospheric source of CH4, because no knowledge existed about this area until very recently. One focus of our multi-year ESAS investigations was to collect a comprehensive data set of continuous ABL CH4 mixing ratio measurements along with continuous measurements of dissolved CH4 in the surface water. When collecting the data set, we aimed to assess CH4 fluxes by using top-down and bottom-up approaches. Achieving representative spatial coverage of the study area with high-resolution, high-accuracy measurements was our priority. We collected data from 2006-2012 with a high-accuracy fast CH4 analyzer; two sonic anemometers measured the 3D wind vector and sonic temperature; a meteorological station measured wind speed and direction, moisture, and temperature; and an open path infrared gas analyzer measured H2O and CO2. Other instruments included a pressure transducer and a motion package that measured 6 components of ship’s motion and also acceleration, magnetic field, and position. In 2011 and 2012 we performed such measurements in the outer ESAS seepage area. Data were synchronized in time and space to demonstrate correspondence of increased atmospheric CH4 levels (up to 3.2 ppm) to observed images of CH4 gas flares and measured levels of dissolved CH4 in the water column. However, these data cannot be considered conclusive for flux calculations until increased background levels of Arctic atmospheric CH4 are established as Arctic source-induced.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus’s surface has a diverse array of geologic terrains that includes ancient cratered regions, young ridges, and numerous fractures. Here we focus on three stages of large-scale deformation: an ancient period (~2 Gyr) that resulted in ridge and fractured terrains, a recent period (< 0.2 Gyr) of possible compression on the leading and trailing hemispheres, and a potentially active period of near global-wide extensional driven deformation. Evidence for the ancient deformation is preserved in the cratered Saturnian and anti-Saturnian hemispheres in the form of small ridges (10s m high, 1-15 km long), and short (>10 km) narrow (~10s m) fractures. The next phase of preserved deformation is seen in the much younger ridges of the leading and trailing hemispheres. In the trailing hemisphere are two main sets of ridges: a smaller set (~50 m high), and the larger dorsa (~50 km long, ~800 m high) which can bifurcate in a branching manner with branches that intersect other dorsa at near right angles. We suggest the dorsa are thrust faults that accommodate ~10% shortening. On the leading hemisphere are two different ridge types: a smaller set (1-20 km long, 10s m high), and a larger but less numerous set (~600 m high, 15–35 km long) that are lens-like shape in map view. The larger ridges we interpret to be large-scale thrust faults. The last phase of deformation we explore here is preserved in the numerous fractures extending from the south polar region towards the north. These fractures suggest the leading and trailing hemispheres that were previously dominated by compressional tectonics are now experiencing tension-driven deformation. We suggest the ridges observed in the older cratered Saturnian and anti-Saturnian hemispheres preserve an ancient period of deformation. This was followed much later by a second period of activity that deformed the south polar, leading and trailing hemispheres. We suggest the ice shell is currently thickening from north to south potentially inducing fracturing through the ridged terrains. These distinct phases of deformation suggest Enceladus experiences only episodic overturn on a >1 Gyr year time scale.",

            "abstract": "Coupling on the fault is brought by the microscopic geometrical irregularity on the fault. True contact areas are usually much smaller than total fault area. Frictional force is determined by the breakage and recovery of true contact areas. Meanwhile, rock friction experiments provide macroscopic information of friction.\nIn the numerical simulation, it is often assumed that one seismic event is characterized by one uniform velocity-weakening (VW) patch. However, such seismic patch should be composed of the mixture of VW patch and velocity-strengthening (VS) background. Hence, this study investigates macroscopic frictional property of a heterogeneous fault, where seismic patch and VS background are mixed. For simplicity, we conduct 2D (linear fault) numerical simulation with rate-and-state friction law. We especially focus on how macroscopic friction changes with spatial distribution of microscopic seismic patches.\nFirst, we consider one seismic patch in VS background. When stress loading is too fast, seismic patch slips stably, resulting in macroscopic a-b being simple spatial average of a-b on the fault. If stress loading is slower and stick-slip occurs, spatial averaged stress becomes lower than that expected from spatial averaged a-b, and macroscopic a-b becomes larger than spatial average of a-b on the fault.\nNext, we consider the fault where several seismic patches are distributed. When two seismic patches are separated by VS region, rapid slip cannot overcome the barrier if the size of the barrier exceeds an order of one seismic patch. However, if the distribution of seismic patch is fractal, entire fault can slip rapidly even if the total area of seismic patch is just a half of total fault area. This result implies that seismic patches with very small area in total can rupture the huge area as an earthquake if the hierarchy of spatial distribution is well established. We will also present how macroscopic frictional parameters change with the upper limit of hierarchy, and what kind of fractal distribution enables entire rupture.",

            "abstract": "Many seismological studies have detected the sharp seismic discontinuities in the upper mantle, some of which are interpreted the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). However there are few data at the old Pacific plate, in particular at ocean basin, which is critical information for understanding nature of the oceanic LAB. In 2014 we conducted an active-source refraction/reflection survey along a 1130-km-long line in southeast of the Shatsky Rise. Five ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) were deployed and recovered by R/V Kairei of JAMSTEC. We used an airgun array with a total volume of 7,800 cubic inches with firing at intervals of 200 m. Multi-channel seismic reflection (MCS) data were also collected with a 444-channel, 6,000-m-long streamer cable. In OBS records the apparent velocity of the refraction waves from the uppermost mantle was high (< 8.6 km/sec), and considered to be caused by preferred orientation of olivine (e.g., Kodaira et al., 2014). Another remarkable feature is wide-angle reflection waves from the deep lithosphere at large (150-500 km) offsets. We applied the traveltime mapping method (Fujie et al., 2006), forward analysis (Zelt and Smith, 1992) and the amplitude modeling (Larsen and Grieger, 1998) to the OBS data. The results show that deep mantle reflectors exist at the depths from 35 to 60 km, and one possible explanation is that these reflectors correspond to patched low velocity zones around the base of the lithosphere. On MCS sections the clear and sharp Moho was imaged only at the southwestern end of the profile, but Moho was ambiguous or even not imaged in the most part of the profile. Since our seismic line covers the oceanic lithosphere with different ages that correspond to different stages of the Shatsky activity, the Moho appearance may reflect the variation of the Shatsky activity.",

Although CSEM could provide additional information to seismic surveys, the improvement of its resolution is one of the great issues for hydrocarbon exploration. We demonstrate the improvement of the resolution of CSEM data with our method. \nRecently, the interpretation of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data in the fictitious wave domain has been developed by analytically transforming Maxwell equations from the diffusive domain to the fictitious wave domain. However, the resolution of CSEM data in the fictitious wave domain has not been well exploited.\nIn the present study, we conduct numerical simulations using a three dimensional resistivity model as a sub-seafloor structure including resistive anomalies such as gas hydrate by using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. First, we compare the waveforms in the diffusive and fictitious wave domains. Since electromagnetic propagates like seismic wave in the fictitious wave domain, the response of anomalies are separated from other waves such as direct one and the sensitivity of anomalies becomes higher compared with the data in the diffusive domain. In order to discuss with the resolution, we have developed a gradient-based 3D full waveform inversion of CSEM data in the fictitious wave domain. From our numerical results, we conclude that a high resolution result is obtained by analyzing in the fictitious wave domain. In future work, we planned to examine applying the real observed data of marine CSEM survey.",

            "abstract": "Winegrapes (Vitis vinifera L) are the most valuable horticultural crop in the world with nearly eight million hectares of vineyards in cultivation. Different varieties of winegrapes (e.g., Grenache or Syrah) exhibit an unprecedented amount of phenological and genetic diversity for a cultivated species, which is an important resource to buffer against climate change. Matching phenological strategies of the different winegrape varieties to a particular climate is a fundamental aim for every vineyard manager, especially in the face of significant climatic shifts in many winegrape growing regions. Yet current projections of suitable winegrape growing regions based on future climate scenarios are limited in their utility, as they do not consider the possibility that other varieties better suited to a future climate could be planted within an existing region. For our projections, we built phenological models for the nine most-planted winegrapes globally, which constitutes over 40% of all planted hectares, using a global dataset of budburst, flowering, veraison and maturity. These models were then used to characterize the growing range of 1300 globally planted winegrape varieties. Combing these models with climate projection models under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios we examined future distributions of suitable wine growing regions, as well as the turnover of suitable varieties within existing regions. In some regions of the world, predicted climate change will not significantly alter the varieties that are able to grow, while in others there will need to be shifts in the region itself or in the varieties that are currently planted. Some regions will also see a significant increase in the number and diversity of varieties that can be grown. Our results suggest the need to utilize the full range of winegrape diversity available when considering adaptive strategies in response to changing climates.",

            "abstract": "Temperature and H2O content are key to understanding the origin and evolution of arc basalts. Here we propose that the strong temperature dependence on DNi (olivine-melt), quantified by Li & Ripley (2010), can be used as a thermometer that is largely independent of melt H2O concentration. Currently, the most widely used olivine-melt thermometers (based on partitioning of Mg) are strongly dependent on melt H2O content, and application to hydrous basalts requires that melt H2O contents already be known. If an H2O-independent olivine-melt thermometer could be developed, then application to hydrous basalts will lead to accurate temperatures at the time of olivine crystallization. These temperatures can then be combined with Mg-based olivine-melt thermometers to obtain the magnitude of ∆T, the depression of the olivine liquidus due to melt H2O concentration. In turn, hydrous phase equilibrium data from the literature allow melt H2O concentration to be derived from ∆T (e.g., Medard &Grove, 2008; Almeev et al., 2007). Thus, an H2O-independent olivine-melt thermometer can be used to calculate melt H2O concentrations at the onset of olivine crystallization.\nTo test this approach in hydrous systems, we obtained new Ni concentration data for the H2O-saturated basaltic andesite phase equilibrium experiments of Moore and Carmichael (1998). The predicted temperatures from the inverted L&R’10 model are within 25° C of the measured experimental temperatures. This approach was also tested on 192 olivine-liquid pairs from 18 experimental studies that reported Ni content in both olivine and melt. The average residuals between the calculated and experimental T is -16 °C. We also calibrated a new model based on the same format above, but with an additional pressure term (average residual of -2 °C). Application of this approach to lavas for which H2O in olivine-hosted melt inclusions have been analyzed in the literature shows excellent agreement.",

Quantifying relationship between both of them can help effectively manage land use to improve water quality. Previous studies majorly utilized land use quantity as an indicator to link water quality parameters, which lacked an insight to the influence of land use intensity. Taking upper catchment of Miyun Reservoir as a case study, we proposed a method of aggregating land use quantity and intensity to build a new land use indicator and investigated its explanation empower on water quality. Six nutrient concentrations from 52 sub-watersheds covering the whole catchment were used to characterize spatial distributions of water eutrophication. Based on spatial techniques and empirical conversion coefficients, combined remote sensing with socio-economic statistical data, land use intensity was measured and mapped visually. Then the new land use indicator was calculated and linked to nutrient concentrations by Pearson correlation coefficients. Results demonstrated that our new land use indicator incorporating intensity information can quantify the potential different nutrients exporting abilities from land uses. Comparing to traditional indicators only characterized by land use quantity, most Pearson correlation coefficients between new indicator and water nutrient concentrations increased. New information enhanced the explanatory power of land use on water nutrient concentrations. Then it can help better understand the impact of land use on water quality and guide land use management for supporting decision making.",

            "abstract": "The twentieth century Northern Hemisphere mean surface temperature (NHT) is characterized by a multidecadal warming-cooling-warming pattern followed by a flat trend since about 2000 (recent warming hiatus). Here we demonstrate that the multidcadal variability in NHT including the recent warming hiatus is tied to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the NAO is implicated as a useful predictor of NHT multidecadal variability. Observational analysis shows that the NAO leads both the detrended NHT and oceanic Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) by 15–20 years. Theoretical analysis illuminates that the NAO precedes NHT multidecadal variability through its delayed effect on the AMO due to the large thermal inertia associated with slow oceanic processes.\nThe CCSM4 model is employed to investigate possible physical mechanisms. The positive NAO forces the strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and induces a basin-wide uniform sea surface temperature (SST) warming that corresponds to the AMO. The SST field exhibits a delayed response to the preceding enhanced AMOC, and shows a pattern similar to the North Atlantic tripole (NAT), with SST warming in the northern North Atlantic and cooling in the southern part. This SST pattern (negative NAT phase) may lead to an atmospheric response that resembles the negative NAO phase, and subsequently the oscillation proceeds, but in the opposite sense. Based on these mechanisms, a simple delayed oscillator model is established to explain the quasi-periodic multidecadal variability of the NAO. The magnitude of the NAO forcing of the AMOC/AMO and the time delay of the AMOC/AMO feedback are two key parameters of the delayed oscillator. For a given set of parameters, the quasi 60-year cycle of the NAO can be well predicted. This delayed oscillator model is useful for understanding of the oscillatory mechanism of the NAO, which has potential for decadal predictions as well as the interpretation of proxy data records.\nAn NAO-based linear model is therefore established to predict the NHT, which gives an excellent hindcast for NHT in 1971–2011 with the recent flat trend well predicted. NHT in 2012–2027 is predicted to fall slightly over the next decades, due to the recent NAO decadal weakening that temporarily offsets the anthropogenically induced warming.",

This eruption is considered to have been a phreato-magmatic eruption, according to the Coordinating Committee for Prediction of Volcanic Eruption in Japan. As characteristic seismic activities before and after the eruption, an A-type event (Mw 2.3) occurred in the northwestern part of Shindake on 23 May, and numerous volcanic events occurred in and around Shindake just after the eruption. The frequency–magnitude distribution (b-value) of earthquakes is commonly high in volcanic areas. It is also known that high b-values in volcanic areas are primarily responsible for material heterogeneity, low shear strength, and high thermal gradients. These facts suggest that the b-value distribution can be used as a tool to locate active magma chambers. It is thus important to determine the distribution of hypocenters precisely and to investigate the b-value distribution on Kuchinoerabujima. We used a data set of the Japan Meteorological Agency and the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, and a half-space with Vp = 2.5 km/s as a velocity structure. For the determination of hypocenters, we used the hypomh (Hirata and Matsu’ura 1987) and hypoDD (Waldhauser and Ellsworth 2000) algorithms. This revealed that many estimated hypocenters were distributed in and around the vent at a depth of ~5 km under Shindake before and after the eruption. A volume of high b (>1.2) was locally observed in the eastern part at depths of 1.0–2.5 km below Shindake before the eruption and another was widely observed at depths of 2.0–4.0 km after the eruption. By comparing these findings with other observation results, we may be able to obtain a clear image of the active magma chamber.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which nitrogen availability limits the terrestrial C sink under rising CO2 is a key uncertainty in carbon cycle and climate change projections. Results from ecosystem manipulation studies and meta-analyses suggest that plant C allocation to roots adjusts dynamically under varying degrees of nitrogen availability and other soil fertility parameters. In addition, the ratio of biomass production to GPP appears to decline under nutrient scarcity. This reflects increasing plant C exudation into the soil (Cex) with decreasing nutrient availability. Cex is consumed by an array of soil organisms and may imply an improvement of nutrient availability to the plant. Thus, N availability is under biological control, but incurs a C cost. In spite of clear observational support, this concept is left unaccounted for in Earth system models.\nWe develop a model for the coupled cycles of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems to explore optimal plant C allocation under rising CO2 and its implications for the ecosystem C balance. The model follows a balanced growth approach, accounting for the trade-offs between leaf versus root growth and Cex in balancing C fixation and N uptake. We assume that Cex is proportional to root mass, and that the ratio of N uptake (Nup) to Cex is proportional to inorganic N concentration in the soil solution. We further assume that Cex is consumed by N2-fixing processes if the ratio of Nup:Cex falls below the inverse of the C cost of N2-fixation.\nOur analysis thereby accounts for the feedbacks between ecosystem C and N cycling and stoichiometry. We address the question of how the plant C economy will adjust under rising atmospheric CO2 and what this implies for the ecosystem C balance and the degree of N limitation.",

            "abstract": "This work evaluates the potential of a hybrid ensemble Kalman filter and four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system for predicting severe weather events from a deterministic point of view. This hybrid system is an adjoint-based 4D-Var system using a background error covariance matrix constructed from the mixture of a so-called NMC method and perturbations in a local ensemble transform Kalman filter data assimilation system, both of which are based on the Japan Meteorological Agency nonhydrostatic model. To construct the background error covariance matrix, we investigated two types of schemes. One is a spatial localization scheme and the other is neighboring ensemble approach, which regards the result at a horizontally spatially shifted point in each ensemble member as that obtained from a different realization of ensemble simulation. An assimilation of a pseudo single-observation located to the north of a tropical cyclone (TC) yielded an analysis increment of wind and temperature physically consistent with what is expected for a mature TC in both hybrid systems, whereas an analysis increment in a 4D-Var system using a static background error covariance distorted a structure of the mature TC. Real data assimilation experiments applied to 4 TCs and 3 local heavy rainfall events showed that hybrid systems and EnKF provided better initial conditions than the NMC-based 4D-Var, both for predicting the intensity and track forecast of TCs and for the location and amount of local heavy rainfall events.",

            "abstract": "The surface warming in recent decades has been most rapid in the Arctic, especially during the winter. Here, by utilizing global reanalysis and satellite datasets, we show that the northward flux of moisture into the Arctic during the winter strengthens the downward infrared radiation (IR) by 30–40 W m-2 over 1–2 weeks. This is followed by a decline of up to 10% in sea ice concentration over the Greenland, Barents and Kara Seas. A climate model simulation indicates that the wind-induced sea-ice drift leads the decline of sea-ice thickness during the early stage of the strong downward IR events, but that within one week the cumulative downward IR effect appears to be dominant. Further analysis indicates that strong downward IR events are preceded several days earlier by enhanced convection over the tropical Indian-western Pacific Ocean. This finding suggests that sea-ice predictions can benefit from an improved understanding of tropical convection and ensuing planetary wave dynamics.",

The database consists of the All-Source Green’s Functions (ASGFs), which means that all the model grid points can be the potential tsunami source points and both the initial sea surface elevations and the initial water mass transports can be included in a source function. With the ASGFs, tsunami source regions no longer need to be restricted to a set of predefined blocks; the spatial resolution of the source functions no longer need to be limited by the sizes of the blocks; the resolutions can be as fine as the model grid spacing; the source function no longer needs to be only the initial sea surface elevations, which has been traditionally the case.\nA numerical model for the linearized and depth averaged shallow water equations is used to calculate the ASGFs. The India, Pacific and Southern Oceans are taken as the model domain with a grid spacing of 5 minutes both in longitudes and latitudes. All the DART buoy locations are taken as the points of interest (POIs) for predictions, but other types of POIs can be added. The database can be used with a GPS-derived tsunami source function to instantaneously predict the arrival times and wave amplitudes of the tsunami at the POIs. It can also be used to assimilate the DART buoy data (or the like) to infer the tsunami source function. The inferred source function can be either used for tsunami predictions at non observational POIs in real time or for post-event studies on tsunami genesis mechanism.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates possible interactions between East Asian cold air outbreak (CAOs) and tropical variability during boreal winter (DJF), particularly in interannual and intraseasonal time scale. The definition of CAOs follows the recent definition that used isentropic coordinate. The CAO definition is based on anomalously large equatorward mass flux below θ=280 K crossing 45°N latitude. This location represents the maxima of extratropical direct (ETD) circulation in the viewpoint of mass-weighted isentropic meridional circulation (MIM; Iwasaki and Mochizuki 2012; Iwasaki et al. 2014; Shoji et al. 2014). Unlike most CAO studies, we utilize quantitative definition of cold air mass (CAM) to estimate the CAO.\nEOF analysis on the seasonal-mean equatorward CAM flux in East Asia reveals two CAO types that can be easily distinguished as the western type CAO (90°-135°E) and eastern type CAO (135°-180°E). These CAOs are significantly associated with remote forcing in tropics. The western CAO tends to be in phase with La Nina event. Otherwise, eastern CAO is dominant in El Nino event.\nIn sub-seasonal scale, day-lagged analysis of CAO event enables us to identify the impact and precursor during CAO event. The impact of western CAO is robust on the development of precipitation downstream around South China Sea and Philippines. Otherwise, eastern CAO event shows less impact possibly due to rapid disappearance over ocean. Remarkably, the preconditioning time of East Asian CAO is accompanied by large-scale organized convection in tropics. It is revealed that western CAOs favor to occur when the MJO arrives in Maritime Continent (MJO phase 4-5). On the other hand, eastern CAOs tend to occur when the MJO arrives in central Pacific (MJO phase 7-8). We investigated that these remote interactions are possibly driven by upper-tropospheric Rossby wave train forcing and enhanced local Hadley circulation associated with MJO-like tropical precipitation. These indicate potential precursors of CAO over East Asia. Particular attentions will be paid to the effectiveness of the precursor for medium- and long-range forecasts.\nRef.:\nIwasaki, T., and Y.

            "abstract": "Lake sediments are frequently utilized for reconstructing paleoclimate in the Arctic, particularly in Iceland, where high sedimentation rates and abundant tephra layers allow for the development high-resolution, well-dated records. However, when developing climate records using biological proxies, catchment-specific processes must be understood and separated from the primary climate signal in order to develop accurate reconstructions. In this study, we compare proxy records (biogenic silica [BSi], C:N, ∂13C, and algal pigments) of the last 2 ka from two nearby lakes in northwest Iceland in order to elucidate how different catchments respond to similar climate history. Torfdalsvatn and Bæjarvötn are two coastal lakes located 60 km apart; mean summer temperatures are highly correlated between the two sites over the instrumental record, and likely for the past 2 ka as well. Consistent with other Icelandic records, both lakes record cooling as decreasing aquatic productivity (BSi) over the last 2 ka. Both sediment cores also record the onset of landscape destabilization, reflected by increased terrestrial input (C:N and ∂13C), which suggests an intensification of cooling. However, the timing and magnitude of this shift differ markedly between lakes. Biological proxies indicate gradual landscape destabilization beginning ~900 AD at Torfdalsvatn in contrast to a sharper, more intense landscape destabilization at ~1400 AD at Bæjarvötn. Because temperatures at the two lakes are well correlated, contrasting proxy responses are likely the result of catchment-specific thresholds and processes. Specifically, a steeper catchment at Bæjarvötn may allow for a more pronounced influx of terrestrial material as the critical shear stress for soil erosion is surpassed more readily. The impact of human colonization on erosion rates is also critical to assess, and recent developments in lipid biomarkers will allow for more precise reconstructions of human activity in each catchment.",

            "abstract": "What happens to recharge magmas as they mix with felsic magma stored in the crust? Under conditions common in nature, a mafic magma quenches against the cooler, more silicic magma and disperses as mafic enclaves, effectively halting the hybridization process at the cm-scale. Here, we present results from an experimental study to investigate the fate of such mafic enclaves as they equilibrate over the course of days (1 h, 10 h, 79 h) with the felsic magma. In detail, we ran diffusion-couple experiments using natural compositions from Quizapu volcano, Chile, at sub-liquidus conditions (T = 1000 ˚C, P = 1.5 kbar, nearly H2O-saturated, fO2= FMQ+4) to document the complex interplay of mineral dissolution and precipitation and diffusive exchange near the “enclave” interface. We record the progressive dissolution of opx, cpx, plg, and oxides in addition to major and trace element concentration profiles (electron probe and LA-ICPMS data) following a diffusion-like exchange between mafic and felsic end-members.\nAs the mafic end-member experiences slow crystal dissolution, the experiments constrain, in the absence of convection, a minimum time scale of survival of mafic enclaves in natural systems. We find that the advancement of the dissolution boundary layer in the mafic end-member correlates with the square-root of the run duration and therefore is diffusion-controlled. Extrapolating the boundary layer progress suggests that under sub-liquidus conditions and without large internal stresses caused by volatile exsolution or advection, cm-size mafic enclaves remain intact for weeks to months. On the other hand, depending on the size of the enclaves, they should be completely consumed/assimilated by the host magma within a few decades even by diffusion-controlled processes alone. Therefore, the presence of mafic enclaves is a testimony to recent mafic recharge, potentially related to or even responsible for eruption triggering.",

We found deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DGSDs) induced by these processes in the Chishan River and Dahan River in the Central Range in Taiwan and the Kumano River in the Kii Mts. in Japan. These areas comprise paleosurface remnants with moderate relief at higher elevations and incised V-shaped inner gorges below them, which were made by the recession of knickpoints. Our studies include field surveys, mapping of DGSD and landslide scars, and cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating of several landform surfaces.\nIn the Dahan River catchment, rims of paleosurfaces, which have a minimum age of ca. 150 kyr, are distributed up to 600 m above the present river bed, acting as a proxy of fluvial dissection associated with phases of river incision since the middle to late Pleistocene. The relationships between slope movements and the topography modified by the river incision show that about 53% of all DGSDs, or all large DGSDs (>106 m2) and catastrophic landslides occurred on slopes along the rims of paleosurfaces, suggesting they could be fundamentally controlled by long-term river incision. Catastrophic landslides observed along or below the rims of paleosurfaces were preceded by buckling of alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone on parallel or underdip cataclinal slopes dipped at 50° to 58°. This suggests that the peripheral zones of the paleosurfaces may be most susceptible to future catastrophic landslides, particularly on parallel or underdip cataclinal slopes comprising alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone dipping at 50° to 60°.\nThe 2009 Typhoon Morakot-induced Shiaolin landslide along the Chishan River and the 2011 Typhoon Talas-induced catastrophic landslides along the Kumano River also occurred on the gravitationally deformed slopes along the rims of paleosurfaces.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault is a mature active fault zone likely to rupture in the near future and DFDP aims to measure physical and chemical conditions within the fault. DFDP-2B borehole was drilled into hanging wall of the Alpine Fault. Downhole temperature measurements carried out in DFDP-2B borehole showed that the geothermal gradient in the hanging wall of the fault is very high, likely reaching to 130-150 °C/km (Sutherland et al., 2015 AGU Fall Meeting). To explain this abnormal feature, the determination of thermal properties of all the rock types in the hanging wall of the Alpine Fault is essential.\nTo measure thermal properties and elastic wave velocities, we collected six typical rock block samples from outcrops in Stony creek and Gaunt creek. These include ultramylonite, mylonite, muscovite schist, garnet amphibolite, protomylonite and schist, which are representative of the hanging wall of the Alpine Fault. Their wet bulk densities are 2.7 – 2.8 g/cm3, and porosities are 1.4 – 3.0%. We prepared a pair of 4 cm cube specimens of each rock type with one flat plane parallel to the foliation.\nFirst, we measured thermal conductivity by the transient plane heat source (hot disc) method in a bulk mode, i.e. to deal with the rock as an isotropic material. However, several samples have clearly visible foliation and are likely to be anisotropic. Thus, the data measured in bulk mode provided an average value of the rocks in the range of approximately 2.4 – 3.2 W/mK. The next step will be to measure thermal conductivity in an anisotropic mode.\nWe also measured P wave velocity (Vp) using the same samples, but in two directions, i.e. parallel and perpendicular to the foliation, respectively. Our preliminary results suggested that Vp is anisotropic in all the six rocks. Generally, Vp parallel to foliation is higher than that in the perpendicular direction. Vp in the parallel direction ranged in 5.5 – 6.0 km/s, whereas in the perpendicular direction it was 4.4 – 5.5 km/s.\nWe thank the PIs and onsite staffs of the DFDP-2 project for their helps to collecting rock samples, and the financial support by JSPS (Japan-New Zealand Joint Research Program).",

            "abstract": "Potential volcanic eruption in Mt. Baekdu (Changbai) has\nbeen a long-lasting concern in the far-eastern Asia.\nThere were several explosive eruptions historically. The\nmost recent eruption was made in 1903. The eruption in\n969 is believed to be the most violent with volcanic\nexplosivity index of 7. The volcano is located in ~130 km\naway from the North Korean nuclear explosion test site\nwhere three moderate-size nuclear explosions with\nmagnitudes of 4.3, 4.7 and 5.1 were conducted in 2006,\n2009 and 2013. There is increasing concern that a large\nnuclear explosion may trigger volcanic eruption. Seismic\nwaveforms are subtle to vary with the crustal structure.\nThe strong ground motions generated by a potential large\nnuclear explosion are difficult to be simulated for\nvolcanic regions where complex crustal structures are\nexpected. We calculate the ground motions by hypothetical\nlarge nuclear explosions using a nuclear-explosion source\nmodel and the seismic waveforms of prior nuclear\nexplosions. The validity of the method is examined by\ncomparing the observed and quasi-synthetic seismic\nwaveforms of prior nuclear explosions. The peak ground\naccelerations (PGA) around the volcano are estimated from\na PGA attenuation equation that was determined based on\nseismic waveforms from natural earthquakes. The\nhorizontal and vertical PGAs by an M7.0 underground\nnuclear explosion are expected to reach 0.14 and 0.11\nm/s2 at the volcano, inducing a dynamic stress in the\nmagma chamber. The induced pressure change in the magma\nchamber is verified by numerical modeling of dynamic\nstress changes.",

            "abstract": "Detailed understanding of local risk factors regarding natural catastrophes requires in-depth characterization of the local exposure. Current exposure capture techniques have to find the balance between resolution and coverage. We aim at bridging this gap by employing a crowd-sourced approach to exposure capturing focusing on risk related to earthquake hazard.\nOpenStreetMap (OSM), the rich and constantly growing geographical database, is an ideal foundation for us. More than 2.5 billion geographical nodes, more than 150 million building footprints (growing by ~100'000 per day), and a plethora of information about school, hospital, and other critical facility locations allow us to exploit this dataset for risk-related computations. We will harvest this dataset by collecting exposure and vulnerability indicators from explicitly provided data (e.g. hospital locations), implicitly provided data (e.g. building shapes and positions), and semantically derived data, i.e. interpretation applying expert knowledge. With this approach, we can increase the resolution of existing exposure models from fragility classes distribution via block-by-block specifications to building-by-building vulnerability.\nTo increase coverage, we will provide a framework for collecting building data by any person or community. We will implement a double crowd-sourced approach to bring together the interest and enthusiasm of communities with the knowledge of earthquake and engineering experts.\nThe first crowd-sourced approach aims at collecting building properties in a community by local people and activists. This will be supported by tailored building capture tools for mobile devices for simple and fast building property capturing. The second crowd-sourced approach involves local experts in estimating building vulnerability that will provide building classification rules that translate building properties into vulnerability and exposure indicators as defined in the Building Taxonomy 2.0 developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM). These indicators will then be combined with a hazard model using the GEM OpenQuake engine to compute a risk model.\nThe free/open framework we will provide can be used on commodity hardware for local to regional exposure capturing and for communities to understand their earthquake risk.",

The laser desorption and electron impact ionization techniques employed by the SP-AMS allow us to differentiate various fullerenes from other aerosol components. Mass spectrum of the identified fullerene soot is consisted by a series of high molecular weight carbon clusters (up to m/z of 2000 in this study), almost identical to the spectral features of commercially available fullerene soot, both with C70 and C60 clusters as the first and second most abundant species. This type of soot was observed throughout the entire study period, with an average mass loading of 0.18 µg/m3, accounting for 6.4% of the black carbon mass, 1.2% of the total organic mass. Temporal variation and diurnal pattern of fullerene soot are overall similar to those of black carbon, but are clearly different in some periods. Combining the positive matrix factorization, back-trajectory and analyses of the meteorological parameters, we identified the petrochemical industrial plants situating upwind from the sampling site, as the major source of fullerene soot. In this regard, our findings imply the ubiquitous presence of fullerene soot in ambient air of industry-influenced area, especially the oil and gas production regions. This study also offers new insights into the characterization of fullerenes from other environmental samples via the advanced SP-AMS technique.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols from natural or anthropogenic sources have profound impacts on the regional and global climate. Currently the radiative forcing of aerosols predicted by global climate models remains highly uncertain, representing the largest uncertainty in climate predictions. The uncertainty mainly arises from the complicated aerosol chemical and physical properties, coarse emission inventories for pre-cursor gases as well as unrealistic representations of aerosol activation and cloud processing in global climate models. In this study, we will utilize multiple satellite measurements including MODIS, MISR and CALIPSO to quantitatively evaluate aerosol simulations from climate models. Our analyses show that the global means in AOD climatology from NCAR CAM5 and GFDL AM3 simulations are comparable with satellite measurements. However, the overall correlation coefficient between the AOD spatial patterns from CAM5 and satellite is only 0.4. Moreover, at finer scales, the magnitude of AOD in CAM5 is much lower than satellite measurements for most of the non-dust regions, especially over East Asia. GFDL AM3 shows better AOD simulations over East Asia. The underestimated AOD over remote maritime areas in CAM5 was attributed to the unrealistic wet removal processes in convective clouds of CAM5. Over continents, biases on AOD could stem from underestimations in the emissions inventory and unresolved sub-grid variations of relative humidity due to the model’s coarse resolution. Uncertainty from emission inventory over developing countries in East Asia will be assessed using the newly updated Regional Emission inventory in Asia (REAS) and Multi-resolution Emission Inventory in China (MEIC) in the model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Like Moon or Mars, Earth experienced one or several deep magma ocean periods of global\nextent in a later stage of its accretion. The crystallization of these magma oceans is of key\nimportance for the chemical structure of Earth, the mantle evolution and the onset of plate\ntectonics. Due to the fast rotation of early Earth and the small magma viscosity, rotation\nprobably had a profound effect on differentiation processes. For example, Matyska et al.\n[1994] propose that the distribution of heterogeneities like the two large low shear velocity\nprovinces (LLSVP) at the core mantle boundary is influenced by rotational dynamics\nof early Earth. Further Garnero and McNamara [2008] suggest that the LLSVPs are\nvery long-living anomalies, probably reaching back to the time of differentiation and\nsolidification of Earth. However, nearly all previous studies neglect the effects of rotation.\nIn our previous work using a Cartesian model, a strong influence of rotation as well as\nof latitude on the differentiation processes in an early magma ocean was revealed. We\nshowed that crystal settling in an early stage of magma ocean crystallization crucially\ndepends on latitude as well as on rotational strength and crystal density.\nIn order to overcome the restrictions as to the geometry of the Cartesian model, we are\ncurrently developing a spherical model to simulate crystal settling in a rotating spherical\nshell. This model will allow us not only to investigate crystal settling at the poles and\nthe equator, but also at latitudes in-between these regions, as well as the migration of\ncrystals between poles and equator.\n",

            "abstract": "That is suggested and widely accepted that a significant portion of the Great Siberian Rivers discharge comes to the Arctic ocean via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). However, that statement was never proofed by observations. When groundwater discharges from the coastal aquifer to the ocean, the radium isotopes are transported with the groundwater, and they can be measured to trace and quantify SGD, and the flux of constituents associated with SGD. The primary goal of this study is to use radium isotopes to proof that SGD is existing in the Laptev Sea coastal zone close to the Lena River delta, which supposed to be characterized by continuous permafrost with thickness up to 600-800m. If so, we supposed to quantify methane fluxes to the coastal ocean through SGD. Discrete seawater, and Lena river water samples\nwere collected from different horizons from the holes made in fast ice using submerged pump and Niskin bottle in the western part of Buor- Khaya Bay in March-April 2014 and 2015. We identified and traced SGD using short-lived radium (224Ra and 223Ra) and radon (222Rn) isotopes in complex with geophysical (electromagnetic technique) , geological (sediment core results from 16 boreholes), hydrological (temperature, salinity), and hydrochemical (total alkalinity, dissolved methane and oxygen) data. It was found that the SGD is controlled by the processes associated with changing state of the subsea permafrost. Thus, this technique can give an unique information about the location of SGD “leakage” sites across the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, which represents > 80% of subsea permafrost existing in the entire Arctic ocean.",

            "abstract": "Lakes vary in response to minor disturbances and, where stabilising feedbacks exist, tend to return to a particular stable state. If the disturbance is strong enough the stabilising forces may be overcome and the lake passes a threshold whereby it shifts into a new state controlled by a new suite of negative feedbacks. A typical switch in state is thought to occur in shallow lake systems whereby a pulse of sediment or nutrients may drive an increase in phytoplankton impacting the light regime. This impacts negatively on submerged plants which results in greater entrainment of benthic sediments and release of buried nutrients. These strengthen the competitive advantage of phytoplankton and entrench the lake in a new state.\nMultiple diatom-based sedimentary records of change in wetlands in the lower River Murray, Australia, have revealed assemblage turnover following river regulation and the impoundment of the estuary. Typically, benthic and epiphytic flora have yielded to planktonic and disturbance taxa indicative the loss of aquatic plants and a decline in the light regime consistent with regime shift theory. This evidence is supported by changes in the remains of macrophytes, cladocerans and stable isotopes which reveal the loss of plants and the shift to a pelagic system. However, rather than exhibiting flickering before changing abruptly, these systems have changed gradually over several decades. It could be argued that this represents a slow response to a threshold change. Alternatively, it is merely an ongoing response to the persistent pressure exerted by increased fluxes of sediments and nutrients.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness within ecology that all organisms are “engineers” of their own ecosystems. Humans are no exception; indeed, the human impact on the earth system is so massive that it is said to define a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Our impact is largely deleterious in the precise sense that it undermines the very ecological conditions that enabled human survival and flourishing in the first place; it is thus ultimately self-defeating. The current crises of biodiversity loss and anthropogenic climate change are only the most dramatic and urgent manifestations of the fact that humanity has not contrived a self-sustaining modality of existence on this planet. As ecologist Eugene Odum put it, “The present concept of ‘unlimited exploitation of resources’ [must] give way to ‘unlimited ingenuity in perpetuating a cyclic abundance of resources’ ”. While some steps that can be taken to resolve the climate crisis (such as the development of more efficient photovoltaics) are not necessarily biological, an essential component of any effective and sustainable mitigation of global carbonization must include what can be called biogeoengineering, the application of human ingenuity to the support and restoration of the life support systems of the planet. This would include such measures as massive re- and afforestation, the preservation and creation of wildlife corridors and reserves, and soil building. Such steps would play key roles in drawing down atmospheric carbon, but they would have a larger aim: human ingenuity, both social and technological, must be directed to crafting an essentially symbiotic working relationship with the earth system, such that human activities would tend to support the ‘ecosystem services’ that in turn support humanity. This presentation will outline the theoretical basis for such a possibility, and discuss some of the means that could bring it into being.",

            "abstract": "Lithological investigations performed in the outer part of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) revealed specific features in the structure and distribution of bottom sediments in the studied area. Predominant type of sediments found in the uppermost layers of sediments was mud (that is silt and clay) with particle size <0.01 mm. This is typical for the outer shelves and reflects lowering energy of the depositional environment and sediment maturity towards the shelf break. However, in some areas within the ESAS outer shelf, we found poorly sorted sediments comprised of multiple grain sizes – from <0.01 mm (mud) to >1 mm (coarse sand). Some authors described existence of such areas in the outer part of the Laptev Sea shelf earlier without attributing such variability in sediment grain size to any processes. We hypothesize three possible mechanisms to explain intrusion of high energy processes into the low energy environment: 1) effect of geo-fluid and/or gas (methane) escape through open/deep taliks forming within subsea permafrost due to long-lasting warming by seawater and underlying fault zones (southern end of the Gakkel Ridge); 2) release of underground water through intra-permafrost hydraulic system; and 3) bottom erosion caused by ice-scouring.",

            "abstract": "The Yeongdong region has various meteorological phenomenons by virtue of complicated geographical characteristics with high Taebaek Mountains running from the north to the south and an adjacent East Sea to the east. There are few studies on the slope winds and its turbulent characteristics over the complex terrain, which are critical information in mountain climbing, hiking, paragliding, even winter sports such as alpine skiing and ski jump etc. For the understanding of diverse mountain winds in the complex terrain in Yeongdong, hot-wire anemometers (Campbell Scientific) have been installed at a couple of sites since October 2014 and several automatic weather stations at several sites around the mountainous region in Yeongdong since November 2012.\nWRF model simulations have been also done with an ultra-fine horizontal resolution of 300 m for 10 years. Generally, model and observation show that the dominant wind is westerly, approximately more than 75%. It is quite consistent that wind fields from both model and observation agree with each other in the valley region and at the top of the mountain, but there is a significant disagreement in wind direction specifically in the slide slope. Probably this implies model’s performance with even an ultra-fine resolution is still not enough for the slide slope domain of complex terrains. Despite that, the observation clearly showed up- and down slope winds for the weak synoptic conditions carefully selected such as strong insolation and a synoptic wind less than 5m/s in the 850 hPa. The up- and down slope flows are also demonstrated in the snow-covered condition as well as grass ground. Further, planar fit transformation algorithm against the coordinate tilt has been applied to raw wind data (10Hz) of the slope site for the analysis of turbulence properties. Turbulence also increases with synoptic wind strength. Detailed analysis of mechanical turbulence and buoyance will be discussed for different surface properties (grass or snow), and wind strength (weak and strong).",

            "abstract": "NARCliM (NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling Project) is a regional climate project for Australia and the surrounding region. It dynamically downscales 4 General Circulation Models (GCMs) using three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) to provide climate projections for the CORDEX-AustralAsia region at 50 km resolution, and for south-east Australia at 10 km resolution. The project differs from previous work in the level of sophistication of model selection. Specifically, the selection process for GCMs included (i) conducting literature review to evaluate model performance, (ii) analysing model independence, and (iii) selecting models that span future temperature and precipitation change space. RCMs for downscaling the GCMs were chosen based on their performance for several precipitation events over South-East Australia, and on model independence.\nBayesian Model Averaging (BMA) provides a statistically consistent framework for weighing the models based on their likelihood given the available observations. These weights are used to provide probability distribution functions (pdfs) for model projections. We develop a BMA framework for constructing probabilistic climate projections for spatially-averaged variables from the NARCliM project. The first step in the procedure is smoothing model output in order to exclude the influence of internal climate variability. Our statistical model for model-observations residuals is a homoskedastic iid process. Comparing RCMs with Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) observations is used to determine model weights through Monte Carlo integration. Posterior pdfs of statistical parameters of model-data residuals are obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The uncertainty in the properties of the model-data residuals is fully accounted for when constructing the projections. We present the preliminary results of the BMA analysis for yearly maximum temperature for New South Wales state planning regions for the period 2060-2079.",

Furthermore, soil moisture has been identified as one of the “Essential Climate Variables” expected to improve climate predictions and near-future forecasting. Several studies have been conducted to acquire soil moisture estimates from spaceborne microwave instruments. As a results, soil moisture data is now globally available using several kinds of satellites with different temporal or spatial resolutions. In this study, we investigate four satellite-based soil moisture products, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2), and Fengyun-3B (FY-3B), compared to an independent reference, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture datasets over East Asia. Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) dataset was utilized for land cover classification. The relationship between the GLDAS soil moisture and satellite products was analyzed by using of temporal correlation, unbiased root mean square difference, mean bias, and lagged variables. Especially, over the arid regions (deserts and semi deserts), SMOS showed the best consistency with GLDAS and it was found that ASCAT soil moisture exhibit best correlation versus GLDAS except desert and semi desert regions (Figure 1.). In addition, performances of AMSR2 soil moisture products based on Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and FY-3B over East Asia were also very encouraging (the period 2013).",

Here we apply a ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) receiving network in Asia as well as the space-based GPS occultation experiment onboard the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F3/C) satellite to vertically scan the ionospheric Ne structures, which were perturbed by the magnitude MW7.8 Nepal earthquake that occurred on 25 April 2015. The F3/C Ne profiles show that the Nepal earthquake-generated airwaves penetrate into the ionosphere and change the Ne structure by 10% near hmF2; the vertical scale of the Ne perturbation is about 150 km; the peak Ne layer is uplifted by more than 30 km within one minute. Those results reveal that the earthquake-generated ground displacement should be considered as a significant force that perturbs the vertical Ne structure of the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Active volcanoes are monitored year-round for mitigation of volcanic hazards. The identification of volcano evolution during inter-eruption periods is crucial for timely preparedness. Volcanic evolutions typically accompany significant changes in medium composition, temperature and stress field, causing changes of properties and structures of the medium including porosity, density, amount of cracks, and fluid saturation that control seismic properties of the medium. The P and S velocities changes with medium properties. Monitoring the seismic properties are useful for identification of volcanic evolution. The ratio between P and S velocities, Vp/Vs, is particularly effective for monitoring the volcanoes. The Vp/Vs ratios are estimated using a modified Wadati analysis based on the travel times of local P and S waves. Redoubt volcano is a glaciated stratovolcano in the northeastern Aleutian volcanic arc. The recent eruptions in 1989-1990 and 2009 are accompanied by lava dome growth and magmatic explosions. The temporal variation of Vp/Vs ratios in the upper crust around Redoubt volcano during 1989-2014 is investigated. The Vp/Vs ratios reach ~1.9 just before the 1989-1990 and 2009 eruptions. The partial melts in the medium may cause such high Vp/Vs ratios. The Vp/Vs ratios rapidly decrease to ~1.7 during explosive eruptions in 1989-1990 and 2009. The decrease of Vp/Vs ratios may be associated with melt eruptions and gas emission. The Vp/Vs ratios increase with a rate of 0.00638 per year during the inter-eruption period after the 1989-1990 eruption before the 2009 eruption, reaching ~1.73 in 1994 and constant during 1994-2008. The mild increase of Vp/Vs ratios may be associated with slow decrease of overpressurized gas and increase of fluid saturation. The Vp/Vs ratios abruptly increase to ~1.9 just before the 2009 eruption, suggesting rapid development of partial melts and pressure field. The Vp/Vs ratios after the 2009 eruption consistently increase with a rate of 0.0116 per year. The relatively high increase rate of Vp/Vs ratios may be due to increasing fluid saturation and decreasing overpressurized gas. The observations suggest that the temporal variation of Vp/Vs ratios may allow us to identify the state of volcanic evolution in inter-eruption periods.",

            "abstract": "It is now well understood that water, carbon, and energy fluxes at the surface/atmosphere interface are highly dependent on soil moisture (SM). In addition, SM is required to be used as realistic initial states for the SM variables, for climate predictions and weather forecasting. As satellite remote-sensing have developed greatly, global surface SM datasets have been produced based on several satellites. Three satellites-based SM datasets were inter-compared under different land-cover over East Asia to select most reliable satellite for retrieving SM datasets in dust source regions. We estimated satellite sensors with 1) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), 2) Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and 3) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) was used as reference datasets. In case of arid areas (desert and semi-desert), SMOS-retrieved SM products showed best accuracy (radiometers have generally exhibited a better performance than scatterometers in dry areas). For this reason, SMOS SM products were utilized to retrieve SM over desert areas. The regions that are susceptible to dust outbreaks were investigated using the dust outbreak probability functions (DOPF). Based on DOPF, about 58% of the total number of dust events occurred in regions with a high level of vulnerability where dust outbreaks were predicted with a probability higher than 60%. The SMOS-based DOPF was calculated to be about 62.4% of the dust outbreak vulnerability (DOV) level of the desert areas. Interestingly, East Asian deserts showed an increasing tendency for a high level of DOV during the study period. Those areas were judged to be sources from which dust could be transported to neighboring countries (e.g., Korea and Japan) which can lead to Asian dust storms. These results may allow us to predict trends of dust outbreaks in order to prepare the corresponding disaster response systems.",

The observed streamflow data in the Pearl River Basin for the period 1951-2000 are used to evaluate the model simulation results. Further, in this study, the 55 datasets of climate projection from 18 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the IPCC AR4 (SRES A2/A1B/B1) and AR5 (RCP 2.6/4.5/6.0/8.5) are used to drive the VIC model at 0.5°× 0.5°spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution. Then, the monthly Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and standardized runoff index (SRI) are generated to detect the drought occurrence. This study validates the GCMs projection through comparing the observed precipitation for the period of 2000-2013. Then, spatial variation of the frequency change of moderate drought, severe drought and extreme drought are analyzed for the 21st century. The study reveals that the frequencies of severe drought and extreme drought occurrences over the Pearl River Basin increase along with time. Specifically, for the scenario of AR5 RCP 8.5, the east and west parts of the Pearl River Basin most likely suffer from severe drought and extreme drought with an increased frequency throughout the 21st century.",

The simple model reproduces the strongly timescale-dependent character of the relationships, which changes in strength and direction on scales ranging from days to centuries. Another emphasis is placed on explicitly resolving the air-sea heat fluxes as a function of timescale to provide insight into the coupling between ocean and atmosphere. In constructing and testing the simple model we make use of a multi-millennium-long control integration with a fully coupled climate model. Cross-correlation, spectral analysis and inverse methods are employed to characterize important aspects of the interactions in the full and simple models. It is found that, a) Bjerknes' conjecture on ocean-atmosphere coupling, that is the atmosphere drives climate on high frequencies (days to months) while the ocean acts as the main source of climate variability on interannual and longer timescales, is confirmed; b) the AMOC can be readily understood as a harmonic oscillator driven by the NAO; c) the two-way interaction between NAO and AMO, and also the influence of ENSO on both NAO and AMO are essential for reproducing important correlation features; and d) the consideration of heat fluxes provides additional explanatory power to our model. Our approach not only helps to clarify our understanding for the nature of the atmosphere-ocean interaction problem but also raises new and intriguing questions for future research.",

            "abstract": "Flooding resulting from the bursting of dams formed by landquake events such as rock avalanches, landslides and debris flows can lead to serious bank erosion and inundation of populated areas near rivers. Seismic waves can be generated by landquake events which can be described as time-dependent forces (unloading/reloading cycles) acting on the Earth. In this study, we conduct inversions of long-period (LP, period ≥ 20 sec) waveforms for different source mechanisms. Results show that single-force (SF) mechanism better explains the observed seismograms generated by landquake events. We then perform inversions for the landquake force histories (LFHs) of ten events, which provide quantitative characterization of the initiation, propagation and termination stages of the slope failures. When the results obtained from LP waveforms are analyzed together with high-frequency (HF, 1-3 Hz) seismic signals, we find a relatively strong late-arriving seismic phase (dubbed Dam-forming phase or D-phase) recorded clearly in the HF waveforms at the closest stations, which potentially marks the time when the collapsed masses sliding into river and perhaps even impacting the topographic barrier on the opposite bank. Consequently, our approach to analyzing the LP and HF waveforms developed in this study has a high potential for identifying five dam-forming landquake events (DFLEs) in near real-time using broadband seismic records, which can provide timely warnings of the impending floods to downstream residents.",

Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) are the growing climate induced hazards in the Himalaya. GLOF has increased the vulnerability of community and fragile ecosystem in the mountain valleys. This study has analyzed the potential impacts from GLOF in the highland of eastern Nepal and the potential role of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) to cope with such impacts. I analyzed the trend of climatic pattern (temperature and precipitation) of the Eastern Himalaya Region of Nepal available from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Government of Nepal, and prepared the latest location map of the glacial lakes using google earth and ArcGIS applications in the highland of the Kanchanjungha Conservation Area of the region. Tiptala glacial lake, located at an elevation of 4950 m, within the conservation area, was selected for the GLOF hazard assessment. I used semi-structured questionnaire survey and key informants’ interviews in the community in order to assess the potential hazard of GLOF. With the varying sizes, 46 glacial lakes were located in the region, which covers over 2.57 sq. km in total. Though the larger portion of the downstream area of the Tiptala glacial lake fall in the remote location away from major residential area, few villages, major pasture lands for Yaks, foot trails, and several bridges across the Tamor River below the lake are in risk of GLOF. Poor access due to extreme geographical remoteness and capacity to afford the modern technologies in the community are the major limiting factor to the knowledge and information about the climate change and related impacts. Modern ICTs has high potential to reduce the risk of climate related hazards in the remote area by information dissemination and awareness.",

            "abstract": "The mitigation of potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) can be accomplished by a variety of methods including kinetic impactors, gravity tractors and several nuclear explosion options. Depending on the available lead time prior to Earth impact, non-nuclear options can be very effective at altering a PHO’s orbit. However if the warning time is short nuclear options are generally deemed most effective at mitigating the hazard. The NAIC mission concept for a nuclear mission has been presented at several meetings, including the last PDC 2015.\nWe use the adaptive mesh radiation-hydrocode RAGE [Gittings et al., Computational Science and Discovery, 1, 015005] to perform detailed simulations of this HAIV mission concept. We use the RAGE code to simulate the crater formation by the kinetic impactor as well as the explosion and energy coupling from the follower nuclear explosive device (NED) timed to detonate below the original surface to enhance the energy coupling.\nThe RAGE code has been well validated for a wide variety of applications. In this study, we show how an improved “penetrator” shaped leader can greatly enhance the depth of burial of the following NED. In this work we have started to optimize the leading impactor into a penetrator that will create a much deeper crater into which the NED will explode. The more deeply buried NED will couple energy to the asteroid much more efficiently than a surface burst. Better coupling to the asteroid has several implications: 1) for smaller asteroids lower yield NEDs could be employed; or 2) for much larger asteroids this mission concept could provide an acceptable asteroid disruption with systems available today.

            "abstract": "Pulse-like rupture propagation along a fault has been widely investigated. Especially, Rice et al. [2005] have revealed energetics of steady state slip pulse propagation under slip-weakening friction law theoretically. The propagation velocity of the pulse was, however, considered to be an arbitrary constant in their model, and understanding of what determines the velocity is still developing. For this understanding, we here propose a new model of such a pulse by taking into account the relaxation time of friction suggested by Hatano [2009]. Hatano [2009] has modeled a granular shear layer numerically and found that there exists a relaxation time independent of slip velocity for a transient process in which the slip velocity is instantaneously changed. We assume that the relaxation time corresponds to the passage time of the process zone located behind the leading edge of the pulse. According to Hatano [2009], moreover, the relaxation time depends on the thickness of the granular layer and pressure. Hence, we can derive a theoretical relation between the layer thickness $H_0$, pressure $P$, fracture energy $G$ and rupture velocity $v_r$. In this framework, for example, we can conclude that $v_r$ should be about 70 percent of the Rayleigh wave speed when $H_0 = 100$ [mm] and be close to the Rayleigh wave speed when $H_0 = 10$ [mm] if $P$ and $G$ are assumed to be $100$ [MPa] and $0.1$ [MJ/m${}^2$], respectively. This relationship suggests that the estimation of values of $P$ and $H_0$ could contribute to the estimation of a value of $v_r$, and vice versa.\n",

            "abstract": "We imaged the electrical resistivity structure of the incoming plate and outer forearc across the Middle America Trench with 2-D inversion of marine controlled-source electromagnetic data. The inverted data reveal a high conductivity channel that is congruent with the geometry of the plate interface, which we infer to be subducted sediments. We used the resistivity model to estimate the porosity of the upper plate and underthrust sediments. The sediment porosity decays exponentially as it is subducted along the plate interface, in good agreement with existing constraints from compaction studies. The plate interface is overlain by an upper plate that is one to two orders of magnitude more resistive, requiring low porosities (<15%) that are consistent with a non-accreting margin composed of crystalline basement or lithified sediments.\nAt 18 to 23 km landward of the trench, the conductive channel diverges from the plate interface and extends 1-2 km into the overlying plate below a cluster of active seafloor seeps. The location of the anomaly at depth is synonymous with a rapid steepening of the seafloor slope. The steepened slope occurs at 15 to 25 km landward of the trench and is extensive, persisting for more than 100 km along the margin. This correlation leads us to conclude that the cause of the conductive feature is sediment underplating. The implications for the 1992 tsunami earthquake will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since the early 1970's, inversion techniques have become the most useful tool for inferring the magnetic, dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the solar atmosphere. They have evolved with model dependence as a driver: astrophysical inferences do not only depend on measurements but also on the physics assumed to prevail both on the formation of the spectral line Stokes profiles and on their detection with the instrument. Such an intrinsic model dependence makes it necessary to formulate specific means that include the physics in a proper quantitative way. The core of this physics is in the radiative transfer equation (RTE), where the properties of the atmosphere are assumed to be known while the unknowns are the four Stokes profiles. The solution of the (differential) RTE is known as the direct or forward problem. From an observational point of view, the problem is rather the opposite: the data are made up of the observed Stokes profiles and the unknowns are the solar physical quantities. Inverting the RTE is therefore mandatory. Indeed, the formal solution of this equation can be considered an integral equation. The solution of such an integral equation is called the inverse problem. Inversion techniques are automated codes aimed at solving the inverse problem.\nThe foundations of inversion techniques are critically revisited with an emphasis on making explicit the many assumptions underlying each of them. An incremental complexity procedure is advised for the implementation in practice. Coarse details of the profiles or coarsely sampled profiles should be reproduced first with simple model atmospheres (with, for example, a few physical quantities that are constant with optical depth). If the Stokes profiles are well sampled and differences between synthetic and observed ones are larger than the noise, then the inversion should proceed by using more complex models (that is, models where physical quantities vary with depth or, eventually, with more than one component). Significant improvements are expected as well from the use of new inversion techniques that take the spatial degradation by the instruments into account.",

Nitrate is considered as one of the most widespread contaminant in groundwater and some studies have presented that intake of excess amount of nitrate could be associated with several types of disease. Modeling of nitrate-concentration in groundwater and estimation of nitrogen-form transformation by meteorological effects is necessary for countermeasure to nitrate contamination in groundwater. In this research, groundwater-quality tank model (GQTM) coupled with Fuzzy Optimize Method (FOM) and Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) is proposed to simulate NO3- and Cl- concentrations simultaneously. For the simulation, daily precipitation data and weekly data of NO3- and Cl- concentrations at two observation wells in Kumamoto City for three years (2012-2015) were used. The GQTM coupled with FOM and SCE-UA algorithm provided accurate simulation results in the variations of NO3- and Cl- concentrations. Difference in the concentration-variation ratio between NO3- and Cl- suggested that NO3- concentration variation was mainly due to dilution and concentration processes rather than nitrogen transformation by nitrification-denitrification reaction in the both observation wells. This calculation provides a simple and reliable method in nitrification and denitrification process estimation. The GQTM coupled with FOM and SCE-UA must be useful for managing of groundwater supplies in effective and sustainable manner by providing scientific evidence for the risk of groundwater quality.",

A drilling up to 160m in depth was carried out with sampling geologic cores at a distance of 350m from coastal line. The elevation of the ground surface in the drilling site is about 4m, locates on the foot of Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan. The geology consists mainly of Quaternary, brittle volcanic rocks and fan deposits, and occasionally silt layers. The mixing zone of saltwater-freshwater was detected under 85m depth at the drilling site. A screen interval of the borehole was set from 151 to 157m depth and sampled the groundwater (hereafter called as FGB-water). The Cl- concentration of the FGB-water was 4,990 mg/L with NaCl type (approximately a quarter of salt water), indicating that FGB-water was taken from landward side of mixing zone around saltwater-freshwater interface. In addition to the drilling, the sampling of groundwater from more than 50 wells in the basin was carried out.\nThe adjusted 14C age of FGB-water is estimated at approximately 10,000 years by fitting calculations. The ages of inland groundwater taken from almost same depth to FGB-water are 200-3,000 years. Although it is unclear why the FGB-water is much older than others, a likely explanation is due to the groundwater around saltwater-freshwater interface is moving upward roughly along the landward sloping interface (Cooper, 1964). Such movement would bring deeper and older groundwater to shallow zone.\nAt the drilling site, the freshwater with low electric conductivity was obtained from surface to 84m depth. And they have much lighter stable isotopes (D and 18O) compared to those in inland. That is to say, the groundwater recharged at higher elevation distribute at shallow zone at the FGB. This result supports the upward moving of groundwater at the coastal area.",

            "abstract": "Surface circulation in the Atlantic Ocean is an important mediator of global climate and yet its variability is poorly constrained on centennial timescales. Changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) have been implicated in late Holocene climate variability in the Western Hemisphere, although the relationship between AMOC variability and hydroclimate is uncertain due to the lack of sufficiently highly resolved proxy records. Here we present a replicated reconstruction of sea-surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) from the Garrison Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) spanning the last 4,400 years to better constrain past sea-surface conditions. We generated time series of paired Mg/Ca (SST proxy) and δ18O (SST and SSS proxy) variations in planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white variety) from three multi-cores collected in 2010. Using a Monte Carlo-based technique we produce a stacked record from the three multi-cores and constrain analytical, calibration, chronological, and sampling uncertainties. We apply this technique to existing paired Mg/Ca- δ18O studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean to facilitate comparison between time-uncertain proxy reconstructions. The Garrison Basin stack exhibits large centennial-scale variability (σSST~0.6°C; δ18Osw~0.17‰) and indicates a substantially cool (0.9±0.5°C) and fresh (0.26±0.1‰) Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450-1850 A.D.), corroborating extant records from the Gulf of Mexico. Focusing on the last millennium, we analyze a suite of oceanic and terrestrial proxy records to demonstrate a centennial-scale link between salt advection in the Atlantic Ocean, a diagnostic parameter of ocean circulation, and hydroclimate in the adjacent continents. The ensuing multiproxy relationships seem to be consistent with spatial field correlations of limited salinity and rainfall instrumental/reanalysis data, which suggest that NGOM salinity varies with large-scale Atlantic Ocean circulation and continental precipitation. Our results imply significant centennial-scale variability over the late Holocene and are consistent with limited observational analysis indicating a slowdown of AMOC during the LIA.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how stress changes over time is important as it is related to studies of earthquake triggering and mantle rheology. We calculate stress variation at the Earth’s surface on the global scale from 2003 to 2014, resultant from several major physical forces acting on the Earth. The physical forces we considered include the surface loading due to terrestrial water storage (TWS), force associated with post-glacial rebound (PGR) and tidal loading (including solid tide and ocean tide). The stress change associated with TWS is calculated in this way: we infer TWS from monthly gravity field of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), in which gravity variation associated with PGR has been removed; we then estimate stress change at the Earth’s surface as the elastic response of the GRACE-inferred TWS change. The stress change associated with PGR is calculated as the rate of viscoelastic stress change responding to ice loading from ICE-5G model. And, tidal stress is calculated as the elastic response of the Earth to the traction forces of the Sun and the Moon (solid tide) and to the loading of ocean tide. The total stress change is the sum of the stress changes associated with these three types of forces. As first result, in the study period from 2003 to 2014, the radial normal stress variation exhibits a prominent decreasing trend in southern Africa and Queen Maud Land of Antarctica, an increasing trend in Alaska of the US (United States), Greenland and Marie Byrd Land of Antarctica, and strong annual cycles in southern Africa and Alaska of the US. We will present the geographical distribution of global stress variation from 2003 to 2014 and discuss its possible implications.",

Indeed, in recent studies it has been shown that root exudates and especially mucilage alter the hydraulic properties of the soil, and that drying and wetting cycles of mucilage result in non-equilibrium water dynamics in the rhizosphere. While there are experimental evidences and simplified 1D model for those concepts, an integrated model that considers rhizosphere processes with a detailed model for water and roots flow is absent. Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop a 3D physical model of water flow in the soil-plant continuum that take in consideration root architecture and rhizosphere specific properties.\nWe simulate wetting and drying cycles and examine the impact of various rhizosphere processes on water content distribution and root water uptake (RWU). For wetting, the model predict that after infiltration the rate of change in the rhizosphere water content is lower than in the bulk soil (due to non-equilibrium), but over time water infiltrated into the rhizosphere and eventually the water content in the rhizosphere became higher than in the bulk soil. For drying, the high water holding capacity of the rhizosphere, and the non-equilibrium between water content and water potential delay the onset of stress. Furthermore, when continues drying-wetting setup is examined, rhizosphere properties results in a lower fluctuation of the water content around the root. Overall, the model presented here is the first attempt to include rhizosphere specific processes within a detailed soil-plant water flow model. The model provides a tool to examine the impact of different rhizosphere processes on water dynamics and RWU under different irrigation practices.",

            "abstract": "The most critical issue in reducing the accuracy of seafloor positioning system, GPS/Acoustic technique, is large-scale thermal gradient of sound-speed structure [Muto et al., 2008] due to the ocean current. For example, Kuroshio Current, near our observation station, forms this structure. To improve the accuracy of seafloor benchmark position (SBP), we need to directly measure the structure frequently, or estimate it from travel time residual. The former, we repeatedly measure the sound-speed at Kuroshio axis using Underway CTD and try to apply analysis method of seafloor positioning [Yasuda et al., 2015 AGU meeting]. The latter, however, we cannot estimate the structure using travel time residual until now. Accordingly, in this study, we focus on azimuthal dependence of Estimated Mean Sound-Speed (EMSS). EMSS is defined as distance between vessel position and estimated SBP divided by travel time. If thermal gradient exists and SBP is true, EMSS should have azimuthal dependence with the assumption of horizontal layered sound-speed structure in our previous analysis method. We use the data at KMC located on the central part of Nankai Trough, Japan on Jan. 28, 2015, because on that day KMC was on the north edge of Kuroshio, where we expect that thermal gradient exists. In our analysis method, the hyper parameter (μ value) weights travel time residual and rate of change of sound speed structure. However, EMSS derived from μ value determined by Ikuta et al. [2008] does not have azimuthal dependence, that is, we cannot estimate thermal gradient. Thus, we expect SBP has a large bias. Therefore, in this study, we use another μ value and examine whether EMSS has azimuthal dependence or not. With the μ value of this study, which is 1 order of magnitude smaller than the previous value, EMSS has azimuthal dependence that is consistent with observation day’s thermal gradient. This result shows that we can estimate the thermal gradient adequately. This SBP displaces 25.6 cm to the north and 11.8 cm to the east compared to previous SBP. This displacement reduces the bias of SBP and RMS of horizontal component in time series to 1/3. Therefore, determination of SBP is suitable when the thermal gradient exists on observation day and EMSS has azimuthal dependence for redetermination of μ value.",

            "abstract": "The Svyatogor Ridge, located west of the Knipovich Spreading Ridge (KR) and south of the Molloy Transform Fault (MTF), is hypothesized to have once been the south tip of Vestnesa Ridge; a large sediment drift that was offset during the last 2 Ma along the MTF. The sedimentary cover across Svyatogor Ridge is limited, compared to Vestnesa Ridge, and basement outcrops are identified ~850 mbsf on the apex of the ridge. Despite the limited sedimentation, and its unique location at the intersection between the KR and MTF, Svyatogor Ridge has evidence of shallow gas accumulations; a strong BSR indicating a gas hydrate and underlying free gas system, and fluid flow pathways to the seafloor culminating in pockmarks. Using a high-resolution P-Cable 3D seismic survey, 2D seismic, and multibeam bathymetry data, we investigate how tectonic and sedimentary regimes have influenced the formation of a well-developed gas hydrate system. Sedimentation related with the Vestnesa drift on Svyatogor Ridge is interpreted to have begun ~2-3 Ma. The young age of the underlying oceanic crust, and subsequent synrift sediments below drift strata, suggests gas production from early Miocene aged hydrocarbon source identified in ODP Site 909 to the west, is unlikely in this region. Additionally, given the ultra-slow, magma limited spreading regime of the KR, we do not expect significant thermogenic methane generation from shallow magmatic sources. Therefore, in addition to some microbial gas production, Johnson et al. (2015) hypothesize a contribution from an abiotic source may explain the well-developed gas hydrate system. Large-scale basement faults identified in the seismic data are interpreted as detachment faults, which have exhumed relatively young ultramafic rocks. These detachment faults act as conduits for fluid flow, allowing circulation of seawater to drive serpentinization and subsequently act as pathways for fluids and abiotic methane to reach the shallow subsurface. This work aims to constrain the sedimentary and tectonic history of Svyatogor Ridge to determine 1) the relative interactions between basement detachment faults and overlying faults in the sedimentary cover, 2) the potential role of these faults as gas/fluid conduits and 3) how the underlying structural evolution has influenced the evolution of the gas hydrate system.",

            "abstract": "Ocean storms are strong, local atmospheric disturbances and contain amounts of energy, which can be transferred from atmospheric energy to ocean gravitational wave energy. This is then partly transferred to elastic energy by interaction with the seafloor. Such elastic energy can make its footprint on seismic records and is part of recorded seismic noise. Research on seismic noise can be traced back as early as 1900s and was mainly focused on long-period noise called Earth’s background free oscillations, or so called Earth’s hum(2-7mHz) and relatively short-period noise microseisms(0.05-0.5Hz). Both Earth’s hum and microseisms are actually ground motions recorded by seismic stations. Now a day, many 1Hz gPhone gravimeters have been located at some seismic stations and observed these ground motions recorded in Chinese mainland.\nSo in this paper, Firstly, the 1Hz datum of the WUSHI seismic stations have been analyzed with wavelet and tidal correcting. It is shown that the noise level calculated by the db4 wavelet and larger 2 level are similar with the tidal corrected method. And the noise level which are estimated with the standard deviation of the gravity residual each day, shown the year periodic change. In spring and winter, the noise level is almost largest, and reaches the minimum in the summer. The noise level is about 10±5×10-8ms-2. Secondly, from 2007 to 2008, more than 2 years datum of 12 gPhone gravimeters are analyszed along with co-located each other by wavelet method. It is shown that, in Fig 1, there are only 1-3 ×10-8ms-2 difference amount all the gPhone gravimeter noise leve at the same time and more than 95% of the correlation amount all the time series of gPhone gravimeters noise level. So, at last, by analysized the station type and the noise level of the 12 seismic stations with gPhone gravimeter, it is shown that, the noise level of the cave stations is smaller than the basement or surface station’s. And the noise level near the coastline is greater than the western one. There are the half year period at the Tibet area.",

However, we are now faced with the some task like the preservation of hydrothermal vent community and the secure of amount of mineral reserves for the commercialization. In Japan, the exploration and investigation researches in Japan’s EEZ has been conducted from 1980s, and about 20 seafloor hydrothermal fields including several confirmed SMSs has been discovered so far. The Cabinet Office of Government Japan (2013) have been promoting “assessment of the amount of reserves of known mineral deposits, discovery of new mineral deposits and comprehension of the approximate amount of reserves, development of equipment technologies and environmental impact assessment methods related to mining and lifting, including actual offshore tests”, expecting projects to be initiated aiming at commercialization with the participation of private companies in or after FY2023-FY2027. As part of the promotion, the “Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP)” was started at FY2014 by the Cabinet Office of Government Japan, and the research project of “Next-generation technology for ocean resources exploration” is also ongoing (FY2014-FY2018). J-MARES(Research and Development Partnership for Next Generation Technology of Marine Resources Survey) is one of the private union participated the SIP organized four Inc.(JAPAX, JGI, NSENGI, and MMTEC) aimed at construction of “Multi-stage and integrated approach for SMSs exploration” through the development of upgradable and effectual geophysical exploration methods on seismic and electric-magnetic methods, and combination of the known exploration tools and systems.\nIn this presentation, we introduce some results obtained from two research cruise (JM14-01 and JM14-02) on the known seafloor hydrothermal fields. Especially, we conducted some test to raise operation efficiency for both towing EM system and vertical cable seismic (VCS) system.

            "abstract": "In a market demanding lower resource prices and increasing efficiencies, resources companies are increasingly looking to the realm of real-time, high-frequency data streams to better measure and manage their minerals processing chain, from pit to plant to port. Sensor streams can include real-time drilling engineering information, data streams from mining trucks, and on-stream sensors operating in the plant feeding back rich chemical information. There are also many opportunities to deploy new sensor streams - unlike environmental monitoring networks, the mine environment is not energy- or bandwidth-limited.\nAlthough the promised efficiency dividends are inviting, the path to achieving these is difficult to see for most companies. As well as knowing where to invest in new sensor technology and how to integrate the new data streams, companies must grapple with risk-laden changes to their established methods of control to achieve maximum gains.\nWhat is required is a sandbox data environment for the development of analysis and control strategies at scale, allowing companies to de-risk proposed changes before actually deploying them to a live mine environment. In this presentation we describe our approach to simulating real-time scaleable data streams in a mine environment. Our sandbox consists of three layers: (a) a ground-truth layer that contains geological models, which can be statistically based on historical operations data, (b) a measurement layer - a network of RESTful synthetic sensor microservices which can simulate measurements of ground-truth properties, and (c) a control layer, which integrates the sensor streams and drives the measurement and optimisation strategies. The control layer could be a new machine learner, or simply a company’s existing data infrastructure. Containerisation allows rapid deployment of large numbers of sensors, as well as service discovery to form a dynamic network of thousands of sensors, at a far lower cost than physically building the network.",

            "abstract": "As the largest rocky layer in the Earth, the lower mantle plays a critical role in controlling convective patterns in our planet. Current mineralogical models suggest that the lower mantle is dominated by (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite (SiPv; about 70 – 90% in volume fraction) and (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase (Fp). Knowledge of rheological properties and textures of the major constituent minerals is critical in understanding dynamic processes of the deep Earth, and relating seismic observations to mineralogy. While individual properties of these phases have been studied, fewer informations on polyphase aggregates are available (e.g. [1]). Fundamental understanding about the stress-strain interactions among the phases and their effect on the bulk rheology still remains to be properly addressed. We examine stress/strain partitioning and rheological properties of a two-phase polycrystal CaGeO3 perovskite (GePv) and MgO, deformed in the D-DIA at controlled speed ~1 – 3×10-5 s-1 at high pressures and temperatures (between 3 to 10 GPa and 300 to 1200 K), with bulk axial strains up to ~30% [2]. We use Elasto-Visco Plastic Self-Consistent modeling (EVPSC) [3] to reproduce lattice strains and textures measured in-situ with synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We compare the results to those on an identical deformation experiment with a single phase (GePv) polycrystal. We will discuss stress distributions between the two phases in the composite, texture developments, relationships with active slip systems, and finally the implications for rheological and seismic properties of the lower mantle.\n[1] Girard, J., Amulele, G., Farla, R., Mohiuddin, A., Karato, S-I.

Policymakers, planners and institutions are in dire need of reliable and updated land use references. Actually conventional land use mapping methods are inefficient under the tropic with frequent cloud cover and loosely synchronous vegetative cycles of the crops due to a constant temperature. This study aims to provide an appropriate method for the identification and mapping of tropical crops by remote sensing. For this purpose, we assess the potential of polarimetric SAR imagery associated with associated with machine learning algorithms. The method has been developed and tested on a study area of 25*25 km thanks to 6 RADARSAT-2 images in 2014 in full-polarization. A set of radar indicators (backscatter coefficient, bands ratios, indices, polarimetric decompositions (Freeman-Durden, Van zyl, Yamaguchi, Cloude and Pottier, Krogager), texture, etc.) was calculated from the coherency matrix. A random forest procedure allowed the selection of the most important variables on each images to reduce the dimension of the dataset and the processing time. Support Vector Machines (SVM), allowed the classification of these indicators based on a learning database created from field observations in 2013. The method shows an overall accuracy of 88% with a Kappa index of 0.82 for the identification of four major crops.",

            "abstract": "The last decade (2000–2010) was the warmest on record at high northern latitudes. Surface air temperature anomalies and associated sea level pressure fields in Arctic exhibited different spatial patterns at the beginning of the 21st century than they did throughout the majority of the 20th century.\nIn eastern Siberia, the abrupt soil warming within upper permafrost layer and deepening active layer thickness has observed in response to increasing in soil moisture under wet hydro-climatic conditions during the warming period of 2000s. According to climatological analyses, the large positive anomalies of both rainfall and snow accumulation in eastern Siberia are caused by strengthened cyclonic pattern in these years which induce more water vapor advection. These anomalies are more enhanced than those before 1990s and continuously appear after 2004.\nLong-term simulation of permafrost temperature and active layer thickness using a sophisticated land surface model (CHANGE) was carried out. The correlations between precipitation in late summer and soil temperature showed that the most regions exhibited either negative or not significant correlations between precipitation and soil temperature during the past period (1961–1980), whereas positive correlations were observed during the recent period (1991–2009). A region of significantly positive correlation was observed along the Siberian coast and in eastern Siberia and could have corresponded with areas of increased storm activity. The soil warming is thus due to not only increasing in snow accumulation which is well-known relationship by previous studies but also increasing in rainfall in late summer which furthermore accelerates the warming due to changes in hydro-thermal properties within the active layer.\nThe precipitation increase in the last decade led to deepening active layer accompanying with remarkable increase in soil moisture. The perennially waterlogged conditions had exacerbated the boreal forest habitat; that is, larch trees had widely withered and died in eastern Siberia detected by field observation and satellite remote sensing analyses. The change in hydro-thermal regime could have important consequences on permafrost degradation with ecosystem and landscape changes in eastern Siberia.",

            "abstract": "Ice shelves are important elements of the Cryosphere representing the interface between ice, atmosphere and ocean. They are also the mean to discharge ice from the interior ice sheets contributing to the continental ice mass balance. A sudden change in volume and extension of both ice shelves and floating glacier tongues can rapidly increase the ice streams speed and the ice sheets flow variability.The Nansen ice shelf represent a particular sensible interface between the floating ice and the Terra Nova Bay polynya, a sea area that remains ice-free for almost all the winter time , thus being one of the major responsible of the production of the Antarctic bottom water. Remote sensing technologies gave us the opportunity to observe and investigate on the formation and evolution of an incipient crevasse on the Nansen Ice Shelf, starting from 1999. The crack showed a steady and slow increase in length and rotation up to 2011 and then underwent an abrupt evolution. During the 2014 winter season, the crack reached its maximum elongation and the detachment of large tabular bergs seems to be very close. This should be the first observation of a detachment of large tabular bergs from the Nansen Ice Shelf since the beginning of satellite observations and is an opportunity to investigate complex processes. We analyzed the last ten years record of climate data over the Southern ocean to evaluate the relationships between the intense cyclonic activity, synoptic and mesoscale systems, ocean swells and calving events. We used ECMWF ERA-interim global atmospheric reanalysis model, Landsat images and in situ weather observations from AWS of the Italian Antarctic Program deployed over the Terra Nova Bay cost. Our preliminary results show a strong correlation between the occurrence of some anomalous meteorological configurations over the Southern Ocean and the sudden grow of the monitored crack in the ice shelf. If confirmed, together with this new arrangement of the cryosphere, some important consequences are expected in the ice shelf and polynya area.",

            "abstract": "A lightning return stroke is always preceded by a downward leader process. Consequently, the property of a downward leader takes a dominant role in determining the property of the return stroke following the leader. Besides, the channel parameters of a return stroke are all spatial and temporal variables. But these two points are ignored or scorned in most of existing return stroke models. To make up this research gap, we have developed a leader-return stroke coupled model based on the time domain electric field integral equation (TD-EFIE). With a presumed leader channel and boundary condition, a set of equations controlling the evolutions of return stroke parameters, such as the channel current, channel charge deposit, channel radius and conductance, is derived. Furthermore, based on the channel current and conductance, a set of equations for calculating the current-produced electromagnetic fields and light emissions is also derived. A trial of the present model yielded preferable results on both the return stroke current and its light emission in comparison with the observed results in literature.",

            "abstract": "Myanmar, lying in the Alpide earthquake belt, is quite earthquake-prone. There have been at least 16 major earthquakes (M 7.0 – 7.9) and a great earthquake (M 8.0, 1912) in the past 175 years, some of which were quite destructive, for example, 1839 Ava (Innwa) earthquake. With an objective of reducing earthquake risk in Myanmar, seismic zone maps have been constructed since 1959. The first-generation maps were mainly the intensity zoning maps using Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scales (Gorshkov, 1959; Maung Thein, 1985; Maung Thein, 2001). The second-generation maps were partly historical, and partly deterministic (Maung Thein et al., 2003; Maung Thein et al., 2005). In 2012, the third-generation maps, the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) maps were constructed for the whole country. Seismic hazards in these maps are represented by means of peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and spectral acceleration (SA) in the periods of 0.2 s, 0.3 s and 1.0 s. The seismic hazards are calculated in 0.1° x 0.1° interval, assuming the firm rock site condition and all of the PSHA were carried out for 2% and 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years.\nNow, the seismic hazard maps of Myanmar,2012 are planned to update by remodeling the seismic sources. As the first step in updating the previous probabilistic seismic hazard maps developed in 2012 we re-identify the seismogenic sources for Indo-Burma Arc, Eastern Himalaya Arc and Andaman Rift Zone as the areal seismic sources. The major active faults which are seismically very hazardous for Myanmar: Sagaing fault, Kyaukkyan fault, Nan Pon fault, Kabaw fault, Myauk-U fault, Dawei fault, Gwegyo Thrust, major thrusts in north-west Myanmar, and the left-lateral strike-slip faults in the Eastern Highland are identified as the fault sources. The seismic source parameters for each source; the b-value, maximum earthquake potential, and annual rate of exceedance for the specific magnitude earthquake; are estimated by Gutenberg-Richter Law and maximum likelihood method of Kijko (2004) with the complements of geologic and paleoseismic data.\nKeywords: probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, PSHA maps, PGA, PGV, SA, major active faults, areal seismic sources, Indo-Burma Arc, Eastern Himalaya Arc, Sagaing Fault",

            "abstract": "In the crust, fractures/faults can provide preferential pathways for fluid flow or act as barriers\npreventing the flow across these structures. In hydrothermal systems (usually found in fractured rock masses), these discontinuities may play a critical role at various scales, controlling fluid flows and heat transfer.\nThe thermal convection is numerically computed in 3D fluid satured fractured porous media. Fractures are inserted as discrete objects, randomly distributed over a damaged volume, which is a fraction of the total volume. The fluid is assumed to satisfy Darcy's law in the fractures and in the porous medium with exchanges between them. All simulations were made for Rayleigh numbers (Ra) < 150 (hence, the fluid is in thermal equilibrium with the medium), cubic boxes and closed-top conditions. Checks were performed on an unfractured porous medium and the convection cells do start for the theoretical value of Ra, namely 4p². 2D convection was verified up to Ra=800.\nThe influence of parameters such as fracture aperture (or fracture transmissivity), fracture density and fracture length is studied. Moreover, these models are compared to porous media with the same macroscopic permeability.\nPreliminary results show that the non-uniqueness associated with initial conditions which makes possible either 2D or 3D convection in porous media (Schubert & Straus 1979) is no longer true for fractured porous media (at least for 50<Ra<150). The influence of fracture density and fracture aperture on the Nusselt number (Nu) is highly Ra dependent. The effect of the damaged zone on Nu is roughly proportional to its size.\nAll these models also allows us to determine for which range of fracture density the fractured porous medium is in good agreement with an unfractured porous medium of the same bulk permeability.",

            "abstract": "Drinking water security is a growing problem for the population of planet Earth. According to WHO, more than 750 million people on our planet lack access to safe drinking water, resulting in approximately 502,000 diarrhoea deaths in 2012. In order to solve this problem, the Swiss water research institute, Eawag, has developed a method of solar water disinfection, called, “SODIS” The theory of SODIS is simple to understand: a clear plastic bottle filled with water is placed under full sunlight for at least 6 hours. The ultraviolet radiation kills the pathogens in the water, making the originally contaminated water safe for drinking. In order to improve this method, Helioz, an Austrian social enterprise, has created the WADI, a UV measurement device which determines when water is safe for drinking using the SODIS method. When using the WADI, the device should be placed under the sun and surrounded with bottles of water that need to be decontaminated. There is a UV sensor on the WADI, and since the bottles of water and the WADI will have equal exposure to sunlight, the WADI will be able to measure the impact of the sunlight on the contaminated water. This experiment tests the accuracy of the WADI device regarding the time interval needed for contaminated water to be disinfected. The experiment involves using the SODIS method to purify bottles of water contaminated with controlled samples of E. coli. Samples of the water are taken at different time intervals, and the E. coli levels are determined by growing the bacteria from the water samples on agar plates. Ultimately, this helps determine when the water is safe for drinking, and are compared against the WADI’s measurements to test the reliability of the device.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization is expected to occur when fluids are released from the dehydrating subducting slabs and migrate into shear zones and the mantle wedge peridotites. At shallow depths (15-30km) a few percent volume serpentine can lower the viscosity of peridotites by almost an order of magnitude [1]. However, the deformation mechanisms are not easily extrapolable to deeper contexts. The rheology of a rock with two phases of contrasted mechanical properties is highly non-linear with composition and cannot be modelled from its end-members. Here we investigate the rheology of serpentine + olivine « synthetic » peridotites with varying serpentine content (5 to 50%) at high pressure (2- 3 GPa, ca. 60-90 km depth), using the D-DIA large volume press and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and imaging. The results will provide insights on the conditions under which serpentinized peridotites evolve in a regime dominated by the rheology of the strongest phase (olivine) or the weakest phase (antigorite).\n[1] Escartin et al, Journal of Geophysical Research, 1997",

            "abstract": "In India, the present value of water, both potable and not potable, bears no relation to the energy of water production. However, electrical energy spent on ground water extraction alone is equivalent to the nation’s hydroelectric capacity of 40.1 GWh. Likewise, desalinating 1m3 water of the Bay of Bengal would save three times the energy for potable ground water extraction along the coast of the Bay. It is estimated that every second woman in rural India expends 0.98 kWhe/m3/d for bringing water for household needs. Yet, the water-energy nexus remains to be a topic which is gravely ignored. This is largely caused by factors such as lack of awareness, defective public policies, and intrusive cultural practices. Furthermore, there are instances of unceasing dereliction towards water management and maintenance of the sparsely distributed water and waste water treatment plants across the country. This pollutes the local water across India apart from other geogenic impurities.\nAdditionally, product aesthetics and deceptive advertisements take advantage of the abulia generated by users’ ignorance of technical specifications of water technologies and processes in mismanagement of water use. Accordingly, urban residents are tempted to expend on energy intensive water technologies at end use. This worsens the water-energy equation at urban households. Cooking procedures play a significant role in determining the energy expended on water at households. The paper also evaluates total energy expense involved in cultivating some major Kharif and Rabi crops. Manual and traditional agricultural practices are more prominent than mechanized and novel agricultural techniques. The specific energy consumption estimate for different water technologies will help optimize energy expended on water in its life cycles. The implication of the present study of water-energy correlation will help plan and extend water management infrastructure at different locations across India.",

            "abstract": "Large amounts of heat are permanently lost at the surface yielding the classic view of the Earth continuously cooling down. Contrary to this conventional depiction, we propose that the temperature profile in the deep Earth has remained almost constant for the last ~3 billion years (Ga) or more. The core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature reached the mantle solidus of 4100 (+/-300) K after complete crystallization of the magma ocean not more than 1 Ga after the Moon-forming impact. The CMB remains at a similar temperature today; seismological evidences of ultra-low velocity zones suggest partial melting in the D\"-layer and, therefore, a current temperature at, or just below, the mantle solidus.\nSuch a steady thermal state of the CMB temperature excludes thermal buoyancy and compositional convection from being the predominant mechanisms to power the geodynamo over geological time. An alternative mechanism to produce motion in the outer core is mechanical forcing by tidal distortion and planetary precession. The conversion of gravitational and rotational energies of the Earth-Moon-Sun system to core motions could have supplied the lowermost mantle with a variable intensity heat source through geological time, due to the regime of core instabilities and/or changes in the astronomical forces. This variable heat source could explain the dramatic volcanic events that occurred in the Earth's history.",

            "abstract": "Cell count data for estimates of global subseafloor microbial abundance need to be simplified in order to be used for model calculations All models rely on regressions of cell counts vs. depth. Different strategies are being used for simplifying the data, e.g. averaging over highly variable data from different oceanic provinces or excluding individual datasets that cannot be described by a single regression. While providing global estimates, these models fail to identify the finer details of the controls on subseafloor microbial abundance. Most subseafloor microbes are heterotrophic and gain energy by degrading buried organic matter. Because sedimentation rate is usually positively correlated with primary productivity and organic matter flux to the seafloor, it determines how much organic matter is deposited on the sea floor and how fast it is buried and reaches greater depths. At the same depth, in environments with low sed. rates the organic matter is older, more degraded and supports less metabolic activity than in those with high sed. rates. As a result, sed. rates control penetration depth of oxygen and other electron acceptors. Oxygen penetration remains in the mm to cm range over most sed. rates and it only penetrates significantly deeper at very low rates of ca. 1 mm/kyr or less. However, microbial abundance correlates with sed. rate over a wider range. In order to take a more detailed look at the influence of sed. rate and therefore sediment age on cell abundance, ages and additional geochemical information were assigned to individual cell counts. The new dataset shows the strong influence of sed. rates or rather sediment age on microbial abundance, while oxygen concentrations seem to have only a minor influence. Using data from IODP drill sites that have moved from high to low productivity zones or vice versa helps to differentiate between different factors that control microbial cell abundance.",

J-MARES aims to establish “Multi-stage and integrated approach for SMSs exploration” using effectual geophysical exploration method and tools.\nJGI proposed the Vertical Cable Seismic (VCS) technique which is a reflection seismic method that uses hydrophone arrays vertically moored from the seafloor. It is useful to delineate detailed structures in a spatially-limited efficiently. We have developed autonomous VCS systems and carried out several VCS surveys in actual hydrothermal area in Okinawa Trough. These results successfully delineated sub-seabed structures that suggest the existence of buried SMS deposits. Based on the successful results of these surveys, we are continuing to polish up the VCS system with data processing methods.\nTo obtain more detailed structure, we have manufactured four new-type of VCS with 16 hydrophones. Then we carry out the VCS survey using deep-tow high frequency source. The key points are (1) a high-frequency source close to the target, (2)efficiency of the surveys and (3)wide-angle reflections to detect of bottom interface of sulfide ore body. The most crucial technical issue is the positioning the deep-tow source.\nAs for the data processing, we have applied Prestack Depth Migration to obtain the subsurface structure but the velocity cannot be estimated adequately. We adopt CSP-EOM processing to VCS data. It is based on scattering phenomena which is useful for the scattering dominant area such as SMS area. This method gives us the velocity estimation of the SMS.\nWe consider VCS has high-potential for SMS exploration. The system will continue to be improved as part of the SIP project, along with other geophysical exploration techniques such as EM, magnetic and gravity.",

            "abstract": "The seismic property of the Earth’s inner core boundary (ICB) is important for our understanding of the evolution and dynamic process of the Earth’s core. We study the seismic properties of ICB by analyzing pre-critical PKiKP phase, a compressional wave reflected off the inner core surface. We collect seismic data recorded by two dense seismic arrays, Hi-net and USArray, in the distance range of 0-100 degree for more than 3000 events from 2004 to 2014 with magnitude greater than 5.8, and perform a systematic search for high-quality PKiKP phases. The PKiKP-PcP(P) differential travel time residuals exhibit variations as large as ±2 s in some regions and nearly no variations in some other regions. We rule out the possible effects of lower mantle heterogeneity and CMB structure, and attribute the observed PKiKP-PcP(P) variations to the irregular topography of inner core surface. Comparisons of regional stacking waveforms and spectral ratios of PKiKP/PcP(P) suggest a possible ICB transition zone in some regions. The thickness of the ICB transition zone is constrained to be no more than 3 km and exhibits variations in 50 km scale. The geographic variations of ICB seismic properties indicate complex thermo-dynamic process near the ICB.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated effects of a reservoir water in a salinized shallow aquifer based on spatial distribution of geochemical properties in groundwater (GW). In many coastal shallow aquifers of arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater table (GWT) depression and salinization have occurred due to GW overexploitation. In Korba aquifer, north-east of Tunisia, after a dam reservoir has been constructed in order to assure a water resource for irrigation, improvement of GW level and quality have been observed in the downstream area of the dam (area-A), while the GW in the other area (area-B) still has high salinity. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of the reservoir water on the GW quality. In June 2013, water quality survey and sampling were carried out at 60 wells (GW), a dam reservoir, river and the sea. Major ions, boron, bromide, and oxygen-18 and deuterium in collected samples were analyzed. From the results, in the area-B, the GWT was lower than the sea level and the high salinity were observed. The Br- concentration of the GW was correlated with the Cl- concentration, and the values of B/Cl- and Br-/Cl- of the GW were similar to the seawater. Since the GWT depression allowed the seawater to intrude into the aquifer, the GW salinization occurred in this area. On the other hand, in the area-A, GWT was higher than the seawater level, and the Na+ and Cl- concentrations were lower than the area-B. Especially, in the irrigated areas by using the reservoir water, the isotopic values, B/Cl- and Br-/Cl- of the GW were relatively higher than the others. The reservoir water has high isotopic values due to evaporation effect, and the B/Cl- and Br-/Cl- values become higher due to organic matters in sediment of the reservoir or soil in the filtration process. Thus, in addition to the direct infiltration from the reservoir into the aquifer, irrigation using a reservoir water probably has a positive impact on the GW quality in this area.",

            "abstract": "We develop a joint procedure to image the Earth’s shallow structure by combining seismic interferometry and a migration method. Based on seismic interferometry, auto-correlation function of tele-seismic wave would be equivalent to the reflected response of shallow structure below the station for a virtual source located at the station. In seismic interferometry, we first construct autocorrelograms of the seismic waves and then stack them at each station for events with different epicenteral distance, source depth and focal-mechanism. Such procedure yields a set of stacked auto-correlograms at each station, which can be viewed as a collection of reflected responses of the Earth’s shallow structure from a set of virtual sources at the locations of stations. We then apply a reverse time migration (RTM) method to image the shallow structure, using the stacked auto-correlograms. In RTM, the structure image is obtained by cross-correlation between wave field from sources and time-reversal wave field from receivers. In this presentation, we will show the concept of joint procedure, synthetic validations of recovering crust structure and possible applications in the real data.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall can be partitioned into throughfall, stemflow and interception loss via the forest canopy. The variability of throughfall has an important role in forest hydrology and biogeochemistry. Previous studies have usually considered the plot scale rainfall partitioned through the canopy, and have not focused on the variation at the whole slope scale. In this study, the effect of stand location on the pattern of rainfall partitioning on a steep slope dominated by deciduous and coniferous trees was evaluated, based on the observation of throughfall and stemflow from the bottom to the top of the slope.\nIn deciduous forest, the mean throughfall to precipitation rations on upper and lower slope were 79 and 88 %, respectively. The mean stemflow to precipitation ratios on the upper and lower slope were 8.7, 2.4%, respectively. The lower part of the slope had a significantly higher throughfall ratio, and a smaller stemflow compared to the upper part of the slope. In coniferous forest, throughfall, stemflow, interception rates were not significantly different between upper and lower slope. In deciduous forest, the stems and branches of lower slope trees extended in the direction of the valley side, unlike the upper slope trees. Canopy structure of deciduous trees was different between the upper and lower slopes, while canopy structure difference was smaller in coniferous forest. The results of this study suggest that stand location on a hillslope affects the canopy structure of the deciduous trees along the hillslope, and lead to differences in rainfall partitioning processes.",

            "abstract": "It has been shown that, based on the analysis of changes of seismic compressional waves that are refracted (PKIKP) and reflected (PKiKP) off the inner core, the Earth’s inner core surface exhibits temporal change beneath Africa, but no discernible change beneath South America. The temporal change of inner core surface occurs in localized regions, and is episodic, rapidly migrating and alternately enlarged and shrunk in a time scale of years. To better understand the nature of temporal change of inner core boundary, we expand the study of temporal change to the inner core surface beneath North Pacific and Eurasia, using doublets occurring in Kuril Islands and Banda Sea between 1990 and 2015. The doublets are within 1 km of separation of depth and horizontal distance. Seismograms recorded at stations in America and Africa for these doublets show clear PKIKP and PKiKP phases sampling the inner core surface beneath North Pacific and Eurasia. No discernible temporal change of PKiKP or PKIKP is observed in those seismic observations. Superimposed PKiKP-PKIKP waveforms of the doublets also show excellent agreements in both absolute arrival time and differential travel time of the two phases. These observations indicate that the inner core surface beneath Eurasia and North Pacific does not experience any detectable temporal change. In this presentation, we will further summarize the results of temporal change of inner core surface reported so far.",

            "abstract": "The ICDP “PaleoVan” drilling campaign at Lake Van, Turkey, provided a long (>100 m) record of lacustrine subsurface sedimentary microbial cell abundance. After the ICDP campaign at Potrok Aike, Argentina, this is only the second time that deep lacustrine cell counts have been documented.\nThe lacustrine cell count data are significantly different from published marine records, the most probable cause being differences in sedimentary organic matter composition, with marine sediments containing a higher fraction of labile organic matter.\nPrevious studies showed that microbial activity and abundance increase within centimetres to meters around geologic interfaces. The finely laminated Lake Van sediment allowed studying this phenomenon on the microscale. We sampled at the scale of individual laminae (0.5 to 1 mm thick) and in some depth intervals we found differences in microbial abundance of up to two orders of magnitude between the different laminae. This small-scale heterogeneity is normally overlooked due to much larger sampling intervals that integrate over several centimetres. However, not all laminated intervals exhibit such large differences in microbial abundance, and some non-laminated horizons show large variability on the millimetre-scale as well. The reasons for such contrasting observations remain elusive, but indicate that heterogeneity of microbial abundance in subsurface sediments has not been taken into account sufficiently. These findings have implications not just for microbiological studies but for geochemistry as well, as the large differences in microbial abundance clearly show that there are distinct microhabitats that deviate considerably from the surrounding layers.",

            "abstract": "The eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) is one of the key areas for studying oceanic processes that control atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Southern-sourced water masses (SOIW) are thought to stimulate the biological pump in the EEP and hence contributed to the CO2 drawdown during glacial times. Orbital forcing in combination with local feedback mechanisms are assumed to be the main driver for this water mass advection. Newest studies, however, question the capability of SOIW to stimulate primary productivity during Marine Isotope Stage 2 (MIS2), as nutrients are rather utilized in the Southern Ocean. Instead, nutrient-rich Glacial North Pacific Intermediate Waters (GNPIW) seem to be a major component of water masses upwelled in the EEP to enhance productivity in the EEP during MIS2.\nWe present changes in biological productivity in the EEP over the last 190 ka derived from surface-dwelling planktic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber and deep-dwelling planktic foraminifera Globorotaloides hexagonus (ODP Site 1240). The δ13C gradient between surface and sub-thermocline (Δδ13Crub-hex) has been used to assess export production in that area. We compare this with variations in the nutrient gradient (Δδ13Chex-SOIW) between sub-thermocline equatorial waters (~350 m) and SOIW. The Δδ13Chex-SOIW variability is dominated by 100 kyr and 23 kyr cycles. This implies a strong response to changes in orbital precession and internal climate forcing related to major changes in ice volume. At times of low precession the difference between the nutrient concentrations of EEP waters and nutrients delivered via SOIW differ substantially, thus indicating that SOIW is not providing sufficient nutrients to stimulate productivity in the EEP. This scenario is most prominent during MIS2 and MIS6. Following the interpretation by Max et al. (submitted) we speculate that similar to MIS2, nutrients were trapped in the Southern Ocean also during MIS6 leaving northward-advected SOIW rather nutrient-depleted. Similar to MIS 2, we assume a greater contribution and hence, influence of nutrients from GNPIW on the productivity of the EEP during MIS6. A switch from GNPIW to SOIW influence of water masses upwelled in the EEP is recorded during glacial terminations.",

Detailed analyses have indicated that this strength asymmetry is mainly derived from the weaker sensitivity of the zonal sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly to that of the diabatic heating anomaly during the development phase of CP El Niño events, which mainly results from the large cancelation induced by the negative SST–cloud thermodynamic feedback that negates the positive dynamical feedback.

It suggests that the CMIP5 models generally depict the asymmetry in amplitude between the two types of El Niño events well, which is consistent with successfully simulating the strength asymmetry of the Bjerknes feedback. As observed during both types of El Niño events, variations in the total cloud amount and short wave radiation also indicated that the cloud radiative effect is an important factor that causes amplitude asymmetry between CP and EP El Niño events.

            "abstract": "Most surface processes that transport sediment are influenced by climate. For example, more rainfall enhances runoff and stream capacity, and colder temperatures expand glaciers at the expense of rivers. Late Cenozoic cooling and glacial cycles during the Quaternary should thus have affected erosion of the Earth’s surface. But whether these changes were also associated with an overall increase of erosion rates is not clear.\nHere, we assess the erosional response of the fluvial-dominated Yamuna catchment in the Garhwal Himalaya, northern India, to late Cenozoic cooling and Quaternary climatic oscillations. Our approach is to measure cosmogenic radionuclide (10Be) concentrations in fluvial sediments (n = 14) eroded from uplifting foreland deposits and compare them with modelled concentrations for different paleo-erosion rate scenarios. This approach differs from previous ones that determine paleo-erosion rates from 10Be concentrations in distinct samples from stratigraphic sections, and avoids misinterpreting short-term fluctuations in 10Be concentrations that are unrelated to erosion rates. We tested this approach in the Mohand Range in northwest India, where Miocene to Quaternary deposits of the paleo-Yamuna River are actively uplifting, and where a robust kinematic model and published stratigraphic age constraints exist.\nOur model free parameters are the shortening rate across the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) and the onset of shortening, within a known amount of total MFT slip (4-5 km). Preliminary results show that we can reproduce the measured 10Be concentrations best when Himalayan erosion rates were lower in the past than they are now, or have been increasing towards the present. Within uncertainties, the best-fit parameter combinations give shortening rates between 10 and 20 mm/yr, which is consistent with independent estimates from a nearby dated strath terrace and expected uplift rates based on channel steepness indices. Scenarios in which erosion rates are constant in time and the same as today, or were higher in the past and have decreased towards the present, yield both poorer fits with measured concentrations and unrealistically low shortening rates. We conclude that long-term erosion rates in the Yamuna catchment have most likely been lower than today or during the Quaternary.",

The chemical speciation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpines emitted by the rainforest were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and proton transfer-reaction mass spectroscopy enabled quantification of the concentrations of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other BVOCs. The temporal and spatial evolution of BVOCs and ozone concentrations within and immediately above the forested canopy were quantified and used to estimate the consumption, production, and transport of BVOCs, ozone, and hydroxyl radical during wet and dry seasons. Fluxes were estimated using above and within canopy flow field measurements from ten sonic anemometers and fitted using a second-order closure approach in conjunction with concentration profiles. Results demonstrate bi-directional fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes in response to local sources and sinks attributed to deposition and chemical transformation in the air space below the upper canopy and transport to the overlying atmosphere. High hydroxyl radical yields (> 106 radicals cm-3 s-1) were estimated from reactions of ozone with ten monoterpene and six sequiterpene species observed to be emitted by the rainforest. Reactions of ozone and hydroxyl radicals dominated the conversion of BVOCs to secondary organic aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei, whose concentrations were measured using a fast mobility particle sizer and a cloud condensation nuclei counter. Results demonstrate that the rainforest emits sufficient chemical species to generate aerosols that can activate into cloud condensation nuclei and influence regional cloud formation.",

            "abstract": "Identification of location and release history of contaminant in groundwater is necessary to improve the remediation accuracy and to decrease the remediation cost. Especially in an industrial complex, groundwater is contaminated by various sources during unknown periods and groundwater remediation turns out complicated problems. A simulation-optimization method is preferred to solve the complicated problems of contaminant source identification because a simulation-optimization method has flexible applicability. For simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport, MODFLOW, MT3DMS and RT3D are used. These models are integrated with a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimization of contaminant location and release history. Because computing time and costs are enormous for a simulation-optimization method, a distributed computing technique is used to reduce computing time and costs. The performance of developed computer programs is evaluated with hypothetical examples with combinations of aquifers and contaminants from simple to complicated levels. The results shows the possibility of developed computer program to solve the problem of contaminant location and release history problems.

As is well known, solar Lyman-alpha radiation is resonantly backscattered from geocoronal neutral hydrogen (H). The resulting resonance glow intensity in the optically thin regime is proportional to H column density along the line of sight (LOS). Here we present the terrestrial exospheric response to geomagnetic storms. We quantify the reaction to geomagnetic activity in form of amplitude and temporal response of the H-density, sampled at different geocentric distances. We find that even in case of a weak storm, the exospheric H-density in regions above the exobase reacts with a suprisingly large increase in a remarkably short time period of less than half a day. Careful analysis of this geomagnetic density effect indicates that it is an expansion in the radial scale height of the exospheric H-density, developing from exobasic heights.",

            "abstract": "Present changes that Arctic snow on sea ice experience due to a warming climate have important implications to the sea ice component, precipitation, heat and radiation budgets. In this study, we analyzed the regional distribution and changes, from 2000 to 2013, of Arctic snow depth simulated with a coupled sea ice-general circulation model. For validation, we compared the modeled snow depths (hs_mod) with airborne snow depth measurements from NASA’s Operation IceBridge (hs_OIB) from 2009 to 2013. As in many current sea-ice models, our model configuration consist on a single-layer snow scheme and lack of explicit snow redistribution processes. The snow is accumulated proportionally to the prescribed sea-ice thickness distribution. Despite the simple scheme, our results show that the hs_mod latitudinal distribution in the western Arctic is in good agreement to the OIB observations. The hs_mod is generally thicker than hs_OIB: for latitudes dominated by first-year ice (between 67° N and 76° N) hs_mod is on average 1.1±7.9 cm thicker than hs_OIB, while for multi-year ice dominated latitudes (> 76° N), hs_mod is on average 3.0±8.8 cm thicker than hs_OIB. By 2013, the Arctic-wide hs decreased 21 % with respect to the hs multi-annual mean (2000 to 2013) occurring mainly in first-year ice dominated areas. In a simple snow mass budget, our results show that 65 % of the yearly accumulated snow is lost by sublimation and snowmelt due to the heat transfer between the snow/ice interface and the atmosphere. Despite the yearly recovery of snow in winter, the long-term reduction in the summer sea-ice extent ultimately affects the maximum accumulation of snow in spring. Compared to snow reduction estimates from snow radar measurements, the model results underestimate this loss, and we suggest that this is partially due to the lack of explicit snow redistribution processes in the model, ratifying the need to include these in current sea-ice models to improve the snow representations.",

However, the relevance of different aerosol species towards causing atmospheric ice nucleation in different contexts is not well-understood. In this presentation, I will show the simulated spatial and seasonal distributions of ice nucleating particles from K-feldspar (the ice-active component of desert dust), marine organics (from sea spray) and black carbon (from combustion). The global distribution of these materials is simulated using two global aerosol model (GLOMAP-mode and EMAC). The contribution of each aerosol species to the INP distribution is calculated using parameterizations of their ice nucleating ability developed from laboratory studies of the materials involved, founding good agreement with INP observations. We found that K-feldspar dominates the atmospheric distribution of ice nucleating particles; however, marine organic INPs and black carbon are important regionally in some seasons. This study advances our understanding of which aerosol species have to be included in order to adequately describe the global and regional distribution of INPs in models.",

            "abstract": "The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) aboard the Cassini spacecraft performs in-situ measurements of the chemical composition of icy dust grains impinging onto the target surface. The instrument recorded cationic Time-of-Flight (ToF) mass spectra of organic-bearing ice grains emitted from Enceladus at different impact velocities causing different molecular fragmentation patterns [1,2].\nHere we present a detailed analysis of these spectra (Type-2) to identify the composition of organic material embedded in Enceladus ice grains. The organic compounds display a great compositional diversity, which indicates varying contributions of several organic species. The spectra analysis is supported by a large-scale laboratory ground campaign yielding a library of analogue spectra for organic material embedded in a water ice matrix. To mimic the identified pattern of cationic fragments in organic enriched spectra we use a laboratory setup: Infrared Free Liquid MALDI ToF Mass Spectrometer (IR-FL-MALDI-ToF-MS). An infrared laser is used to disperse a liquid micro-beam of a water-solution to get cationic fragments. The laser energy is adjusted to simulate different impact velocities of ice particles on CDA [3].\nSo far we have identified characteristic fragment patterns of at least three classes of organic molecules: (i) aromatic species, (ii) amines, and (iii) carbonyl group species.\n(i) ice grains containing aromatic species are identified by a series of characteristic aromatic fragment cations (ii) ice grains containing amines are identified by a pronounced ammonium cation and (iii) ice grains containing carbonyl compounds are specified by a characteristic acylium cation in conjunction with certain others mass lines. Besides aromatic, amine and carbonyl species, Type-2 spectra also show contributions from other, yet un-specified, organic species.\nTypically, fragment cations of aromatic compounds are stable at impact velocities up-to 15km/s whereas cations of amines and carbonyl species are stable at velocities below 8km/s. Work is in progress to quantify concentrations of the identified species and to assign yet un-specified organic mass lines in Type 2 spectra.\nRef: [1]Postberg et al., Icarus-193,2008.

            "abstract": "The water and nutrient uptake of plant roots in soils have a crucial influence on soil physical processes. The interacting processes between plant roots and soil are important for several agricultural problems, for example water management or leaching of pesticides. However, the coupled mechanisms of local soil and root water flow, transport of dissolved substances, root growth, and root uptake are difficult to measure and thus experimental data are rare. Numerical models can be used to understand these complex soil-root systems and help to analyze and interpret experimental measurements. The model approach presented here couples a root system and a soil model. Crucial for this approach is the 1D-3D grid coupling which combines a 1D network grid (root system) with the 3D soil grid. Based on that grid coupling, local processes are defined, for instance the local water uptake of a single root segment. Here, the interface conditions between roots and soil play a major role and we use local grid refinement strategies to better resolve these interface processes. This grid refinement of the 3D soil grid is based on the root network (1D grid) and adapts if root growth occurs. It offers the possibility to describe processes in the soil-plant continuum in a more physical manner avoiding empirical descriptions of root water uptake as a function of bulk matric potential, osmotic potential, root length density, and transpiration rate. Our coupling approach is included into the framework of DuMux, an open-source simulator for flow and transport processes in porous media. This implementation combines biological, chemical and physical processes in soil, inside roots, and at root-soil interfaces, and is contained in a sustainable and consistent framework for the implementation. We will show example simulations describing water flow, solute transport and root growth in a soil-root system.",

This event is exceptional since all four Cluster spacecraft are crossing the diffusion region. Magnetic curvature analysis shows that magnetic field lines are sharply curved with high curvature in the inner outflow regions between the two Hall regions and display nearly coplanar features of antiparallel reconnection. Combination of the decrease in curvature radius of magnetic field lines and the increase in electron gyro-radius induces curvature pitch angle scattering of initially trapped electrons, resulting in an isotropic electron distribution. In Hall regions, magnetic curvature decreases corresponding obviously to the presence of Y-directed Hall fields, which implies that the stress of reconnected field is released here, in agreement with whistler mediated-reconnection. The value and direction of curvature radius are not well organized due to the fluctuating Hall fields resulting from the temporal dynamical reconnection.Same analysis will be applied to MMS data to investigate the fine magnetic structure in diffusion region.",

This information will be used to derive emission estimates which will be used together with known information from the ground, to construct a new emission database for use with regional and local air quality models. In this contribution we report on the use of satellite data to obtain information on the occurrence of aerosols over China. Several different instruments, in particular MODIS and AATSR, are used to provide the spatial AOD since 2002 as well as a merged AOD product providing improved coverage. CALIOP is used to provide information on the vertical structure of aerosols, including aerosol type information. The AOD data sets are validated and evaluated versus sun photometer data from AERONET and the Chinese network CARSNET. This is particularly valuable because aerosol retrieval algorithms are developed and validated over areas where many independent ground-based observations are available, such as over the eastern USA and Europe. However, over these areas the AOD levels are generally much lower than over China, and the occurrence of such high AOD, combined with the variation in aerosol type and surface characteristics, poses particular problems as regards data selection and discrimination between high AOD and the occurrence of clouds. An initial analysis of the spatial and vertical variability of the AOD is provided and time series showing the variation over representative areas are presented, combining the various information sources indicated above. AOD time series will be compared with those from precursor gases and model estimates.",

            "abstract": "In 1996, Tom Crowley published a paper with this title in the journal Marine Micropaleontology. He argues that “study of past warm periods is valuable because it gives insight into important processes that may be operating in the climate system during a warm regime.” The mid-Pliocene warm period (3.264 to 3.025 Ma) has been considered a possible analog for the future long-term consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas changes. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for this period have been estimated to be approximately 350 to 450 ppmv. We have now nearly surpassed globally the mid-point of this range and could surpass 450 ppmv by shortly after year 2030 in the most dire pathway of future emissions.\nSince 2008, the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) has taken on this challenge with simulations by coupled climate models of the mid-Pliocene warm period. These models could not reproduce the mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere warmth indicated by the PRISM3 dataset. This is also the case for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) when applying the forcings and boundary conditions of PlioMIP1. To explore these mismatches, additional simulations with CCSM4 are being used to understand the sensitivity to the paleogeography, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and orbital conditions. We find that when the Bering Strait is closed, as in a new paleogeographic reconstruction for a time-slice centered at 3.205 Ma, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and associated ocean heat transport increase and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures warm. Removing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet results in warming only in the Southern Ocean. Consideration of Northern Hemisphere warm summer orbital conditions also improves the correspondence with the PRISM3 reconstruction of North Atlantic peak annual warmth.",

            "abstract": "Strong earthquakes cause transient perturbations of the near Earth’s surface system. These include the widespread landsliding and subsequent mass movement and the loading of rivers with sediments. In addition, rock mass is shattered during the event, forming cracks that affect rock strength and hydrological conductivity. Often overlooked in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, these perturbations can represent a major part of the overall disaster with an impact that can last for years before restoring to background conditions. Thus, the relaxation phase is part of the seismically induced change by an earthquake and need to be monitored in order to understand the full impact of earthquakes on the Earth system. Here, we present first results from the rapid respond earth surface processes monitoring program put in place by several European groups after the Mw7.9 Gorkha earthquake.\nTo monitor the transient effects of the earthquake on the Earth surface system, we have installed a comprehensive network of 13 river sampling locations for daily water and sediment sampling, covering all major rivers draining the earthquake-affected areas immediately after the event. Nested within this regional network, we have installed an array of 16 seismometers and geophones and 6 weather stations in the upper Bhotekoshi catchment, covering an area of ~50 km2. The field measurements are accompanied by repeated mapping of landslide activities and volumes over subsequent seasons using high resolution optical (RapidEye) and radar imagery (TanDEM TerraSAR-X). The combination of all of these data will help when interpreting our field observation in the regional context of catastrophic failure of hillslopes and their link with sediment transport in the rivers. First river gauging observation show a pronounced increase in river discharge in the order of >20% for the respective pre-monsoon season. We interpreted this as a direct impact of the shaking on the valley-ridge scale sub-subsurface permeability, stressing the large potential effects of strong earthquakes on near-surface processes.\nOur instruments and sampling arrangements will stay in place for at least two monsoon seasons and until the Earth surface dynamics have normalized to the known pre-earthquake state.",

Managed aquifer recharge (MAR), e.g. river bank infiltration or storm water infiltration basins and trenches, represents a promising technique to replenish water resources, and in combination with awareness raising, is an important step towards sustainable water management. However, choice of type and positioning large scale MAR infrastructure is challenging as it requires a detailed understanding of the subsurface. Furthermore, MAR site maintenance can be time intensive and costly as effects, such as bio clogging or colmation can lead to a strong decrease in infiltration capacity. In our work we will show examples of successful implementation of novel strategies of MAR site characterization and monitoring on different scales.",

In this study, the soil moistures in several watersheds in the mountain area of Southern China have been observed continuously. The results show that the water table is this area is relatively low, and the soil moisture content is rather high for most the year, which implies the runoff coefficient is high in this area. The results also show that the soil moisture content alone the slope changes slightly, also changes insignificantly among different slopes. Another finding is that the soil moistures change rapidly during the storm, and get saturated quickly and even for a medium storm, the soil could be filled up. The collected data will be used for further studies such as developing equations for calculating soil movement, runoff production and hydrological model parameter estimation.",

It is expected that the flood warning issuance criteria for small urban streams will assist in regard to the appropriate flood forecast and warnings and the establishment of related policies.\nThis study is suggested standard rainfall for flood warning in medium and small stream depending on variable backwater conditions.

            "abstract": "The amplitude ratio between horizontal and vertical components of Rayleigh waves (also known as ellipticity) is in principle uniquely sensitive to local earth structure beneath each recording station. Rayleigh wave ellipticity is mostly influenced by the shallowest layers, so it can be effectively used to infer the structure of the uppermost crust, with particular relevance for sedimentary environments. We implement an automatic method to measure Rayleigh wave ellipticity, and extensively apply it to teleseismic records from the northern part of Italy, for a period range between 10s and 130s. As expected, no appreciable correlation with epicenter distance or azimuth can be seen, but rather a strong correlation with local structure: generally high horizontal to vertical amplitude ratios are seen in sedimentary settings, with respect to Alpine and Apenninic crystalline-rock terrains. We verify that shortest usable period may be limited by very low shear-wave velocity in shallow sediments, when the assumed retrograde elliptical particle motion polarisation for the fundamental mode breaks off. The highly non-linear sensitivity of frequency-dependent ellipticity curves can then be inverted using a direct search method to infer shear wave velocity profiles below stations. By comparing our results with local a priori geological information we show that robust information can indeed be retrieved.",

            "abstract": "The exchange of energy and water vapor between land surface and atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau area play an important role in the Asian monsoon system, which in turn is a major component of both the energy and water cycles of the global climate system. Supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and some international organizations, a Third Pole Environment (TPE) Research Platform (TPEP) is now implementing over the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding area. The background of the establishment of the TPEP, the establishing and monitoring plan of long-term scale (5-10 years) of the TPEP will be shown firstly. Then the preliminary observational analysis results, such as the characteristics of land surface heat fluxes, and evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning, the characteristics of atmospheric variables, the structure of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and the turbulent characteristics have also been shown in this study.\nThe study on the regional distribution of land surface heat fluxes and ET are of paramount importance over heterogeneous landscape of the Tibetan Plateau. The parameterization method based on satellite data and the ABL observations has been proposed and tested for deriving regional distribution and their ten years variations of land surface variables, land surface heat fluxes and ET over heterogeneous landscape of the whole Tibetan Plateau area. To validate the proposed method, the ground-measured s land surface variables and surface heat fluxes in the TPEP are compared to satellite derived values. The results show that the derived land surface variables, land surface heat fluxes and ET over the study area are in good accordance with the land surface status. These parameters show a wide range due to the strong contrast of surface features. The sensible heat flux is decreasing while the latent heat flux is increasing from 2001 to 2010 over the whole Tibetan Plateau. And the estimated land surface variables and land surface heat fluxes are in good agreement with ground measurements, and all their absolute percent difference is less than 10% in the validation sites. It is therefore concluded that the proposed methods are successful for the retrieval of land surface variables, land surface heat fluxes and ET over heterogeneous landscape of the Tibetan Plateau area.",

            "abstract": "Interpretation of seismic profiles and tomographic models of the Earth’s mantle requires exploring the viscoelastic behaviour of rocks / minerals at low strains and seismic frequencies. These physical properties can be investigated by cyclic loading experiments that measure the dynamic response of materials to an applied stress. To date, these data were only accessible by torsional forced-oscillation tests performed in gas vessel apparatus and limited to ~ 0.3 GPa. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of forced‐oscillations tests up to the Earth’s upper mantle conditions thanks to the development of a torsion module in the Paris‐Edinburgh press and the use of X‐ray radiation.\nThe experimental device is based on the frame of a V7 Paris-Edinburgh press where both of the two opposed anvils can rotate through two sets of gear reducer and thrust bearings located at the end of each anvil. The accurate rotation of the anvils is monitored by stepper motors and encoders, and enables to apply a low-frequency sinusoidal torque on the cell assembly. The sample and an elastic standard of known modulus and negligible dissipation are loaded in series in a boron-epoxy gasket. The measurement of the relative amplitudes and phases of the torsional mode displacements in standard and sample provides for the determination of the shear modulus and of the strain energy dissipation for the sample. The main challenge in applying the forced-oscillation method at high pressure is the need of a technique for measuring stress and strain with sufficient precision, and with sufficiently short measurement time, while the sample is embedded in the high-pressure vessel. These technical difficulties can be overcome through the use of synchrotron radiation. The strain of the sample is measured in situ and in real-time through X-ray radiography, while the stress is estimated from the strain of the elastic standard (a corundum sample in our case). Hence, coupling the new RoToPEc device with synchrotron radiation provides a unique facility for investigating the viscoelastic behaviour of materials under extreme conditions. The potentials of this new equipment will be illustrated by shear modulus and attenuation measurements on olivine.",

            "abstract": "A few case studies in Switzerland exemplify that not only overtopping water bodies frequently cause damages to buildings. Reportedly, a large share of the total loss due to flooding in Switzerland goes back to surface runoff that is formed and is propagating outside of regular watercourses. Nevertheless, little is known about when, where and why such surface runoff occurs.\nThe described process encompasses surface runoff formation, followed by unchannelised overland flow until a water body is reached. It is understood as a type of flash flood, has short response times and occurs diffusely in the landscape. Thus, the process is difficult to observe and study directly. A promising source indicating surface runoff indirectly are houseowners’ damage claims recorded by Swiss Public Insurance Companies for Buildings (PICB). In most of Switzerland, PICB hold a monopoly position and insure (almost) every building. Consequently, PICB generally register all damages to buildings caused by an insured natural hazard (including surface runoff) within the respective zones.\nWe have gathered gapless flood related claim records of most of all Swiss PICB covering more than the last two decades on average. Based on a subset, we have developed a methodology to differentiate claims related to surface runoff from other causes. This allows us to assess the number of claims as well as total loss related to surface runoff and compare these to the numbers of overtopping watercourses. Furthermore, with the good data coverage, we are able to analyze surface runoff related claims in space and time, from which we can infer spatial and temporal characteristics of surface runoff. Although the delivered data of PICB are heterogeneous and, consequently, time-consuming to harmonize, our first results show that exploiting these damage claim records is feasible and worthwhile to learn more about surface runoff in Switzerland.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important state variable in the terrestrial system because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time with characteristic length scales ranging from a few centimeters up to several kilometers and characteristic time scales ranging from minutes up to years. Information on soil moisture dynamics is important for optimizing agricultural management, and to improve our understanding of biogeochemical processes, vadose zone processes, and atmospheric processes. Despite a wealth of available soil moisture measurement techniques, there still exists a gap in measurement capability of classical soil moisture monitoring technologies that makes large-scale soil moisture characterization with high temporal resolution highly challenging. In this presentation, we will review emerging soil moisture sensing techniques that are particularly well suited to overcome this space–time scale gap in measurement capability. In particular, we focus on recent advances in noninvasive techniques that allow continuous noninvasive and contactless measurements of soil moisture dynamics at the field to basin scale, e.g. cosmic-ray neutron probes (CRNP), GNSS reflectometry, ground-based microwave radiometry, gamma-ray monitoring, terrestrial gravimetry, and low-frequency electromagnetic surface waves (LFEMW). These methods have the following important advantages compared to other soil moisture sensing methods: (1) soil structure remains undisturbed by the measurements, (2) the measurement device can be operated continuously (e.g., also during tilling operations), and (3) the soil moisture measurements integrate large areas (i.e., larger than 100m2). We will present basic principles with a particular focus on measurement scale and accuracy, and will also provide example applications for selected methods.",

Many applications in spacecraft navigation, fundamental astronomy, astrometry and geosciences depend on the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) determined by VLBI. Currently, under the IAG/IAU Joint Working Group on the Theory of Earth Rotation, activities are supported to advance the theory of Earth rotation. Some components of Earth Rotation, such as the free modes like the Free Core Nutation (FCN) are not predictable but rely entirely on the observation through VLBI.\nIn our presentation we investigate the EOP when alternating various VLBI analysis options such as correction models, a priori parameters, and other choices with the aim to detect and quantify possible systematic effects. Our approach is purely empirical: we alternate certain analysis options and assess the differences with respect to the reference solution that adheres to the IERS Conventions (2010) and applies the standard parameterization. For demonstration we analyze the regular International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) sessions IVS-R1 and IVS-R4.The IAG flagship component GGOS (Global Geodetic Observing System) aims to provide the EOP with an accuracy of 1 mm on the Earth surface (about 30 microarcseconds). This accuracy target will be applied as a limit to interpret the significance of the differences obtained in our comparisons.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric temperature soundings derived from satellite-based advanced infrared (IR) sounder radiance measurements tend to have higher uncertainty in the upper troposphere. In contrast, radio occultation (RO) measurements have high accuracy and high vertical-resolution for atmospheric sounding in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. It is anticipated that the best estimation of atmospheric thermodynamic state can be obtained by synergistic use of RO and IR radiance measurements. A physical-based algorithm accounting for the significant geometric difference between the two observing systems, has been developed to combine RO refractivity and Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) radiances for atmospheric temperature and humidity vertical profiles. Comparisons between RO/AIRS and AIRS-alone derived profiles showed that the impact of RO observations to be most apparent in the upper troposphere between 100 hPa and 300 hPa, where the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of estimated temperature is reduced by 24% (0.36 K) to 35% (0.66 K). In addition to having improved temperature profile retrievals in the upper troposphere, the humidity retrievals are also improved; the RMSD below 100 hPa was reduced by 22.4% (0.298 g/kg) when compared with radiosondes observations. Results indicated that the humidity profiles retrieved using this method were overall better than the infrared-only retrievals in all of the comparisons, and the temperature profiles improved upon the infrared-only retrievals most notably in the upper troposphere. These improvements are more significant using a three-dimensional (3D) slant-path collocation procedure.",

Estimates of the thermal conductivity of the most abundant phases, at core-mantle boundary conditions vary widely. We performed ab initio simulations to determine the lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 perovskite, finding a value of about 7 ± 1 W m−1 K−1 at core–mantle boundary conditions, consistent with geophysical constraints for the thermal state at the base of the mantle. We find that lattice thermal conductivity depends strongly on pressure, explaining the dynamical stability of super-plumes, but weakly with temperature and composition. Our results show evidence of saturation, at lower mantle temperatures, as the phonon mean free path approaches the interatomic spacing. Combining our results with seismic tomography, we predict large lateral variations in the heat-flux from the core that could have important implications for core dynamics.",

For example, activities of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) under the UNFCCC focus on raising awareness and improving scientific understanding of short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP) impacts and mitigation strategies. Our Japanese research project is searching an optimum reduction path of SLCPs considering climate change, health impacts, and agricultural damages. For this purpose, we use aerosol and chemistry models, SPRINTARS and CHASER, respectively, which have been developed by our group, coupled with a general circulation model, MIROC. In the phase 1 of this project, changes in concentrations and radiative forcing of each major SLCPs originating from China, east Asia, southeast Asia, and south Asia in the last 30 years are estimated with the models. Transient simulations along the new emission scenario, SSPs (Shared Socio-economic Pathways) are executed using the MIROC-SPRINTARS/CHASER with ocean circulation in the phase 2 to analyze full feedbacks including hydrological cycle affected by SLCPs. These simulated results will be utilized to estimate health and agricultural impacts of SLCPs. In this presentation, we discuss the optimum reduction path of SLCPs taking both mitigation of global warming and air pollution into consideration.\nAcknowledgements: Simulations in this study were executed with the supercomputer system of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.

            "abstract": "The vegetation on forested floodplains plays an essential role in floodplain flow routing, flow dynamics and therefore the transfer of sediments and associated nutrients and contaminants. The flow resistance introduced by the presence of vegetation assemblages leads to changes in flow velocity and depth that, in turn, modulate sediment transport. Attempts to quantify these processes remain elusive due to difficulties in accurately estimating the altered flow parameters around and through vegetation.\nHere we employ complementary techniques of characterising the bulk flow properties and vegetation structure. Physical modelling of a prototype scale (2 x 45 m) shallow earthen channel containing small trees, herbaceous plants and leaf-litter was undertaken to explore the bulk flow characteristics. Vegetation structure and fluid retention was measured in controlled discharge experiments for: (1) natural cover of herbs and trees; (2) trees only and; (3) earthen channel only. Dilution-curve data were analysed within the Aggregated Dead Zone (ADZ) framework to yield bulk flow parameters including dispersion, fluid retention and flow resistance parameters. Vegetation structure is recorded using TLS, with data processed to represent vegetation structure as a 3D volume porous media.\nThe main response of flow to vegetation removal was an increase in bulk velocity, with depth and wetted width decreasing slightly. Retentiveness was more prominent during low flow and all three experimental conditions tended to converge on a constant low value for high discharges. Reach mean travel times and the advective time delays decreased very slightly from experiments (1) to (2). The ADZ analysis and TLS data shows that in these two initial experiments, the trees provided the majority of the resistance in contrast to the aggregate effect of herbaceous plants and litter. Removing the trees further decreased travel times such that the ADZ residence time was more than halved moving from condition (1) to (3). The overall bulk flow effect of tree cover on retention is here expressed by the dispersive fraction parameter, which reduced from 0.4 to 0.2 when vegetation was removed.",

            "abstract": "We present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for the 2D gravity inversion of a localized subsurface object with constant density contrast. Our models have four parameters: the density contrast, the number of vertices in a polygonal approximation of the object, an upper bound on the ratio of the perimeter squared to the area, and the vertices of a polygon container that bounds the object. Reasonable parameter values can be estimated prior to inversion using a forward model and geologic information. In addition, we assume that the field data have a common random uncertainty that lies between two bounds but that it has no systematic uncertainty. Finally, we assume that there is no uncertainty in the spatial locations of the measurement stations.\nFor any set of model parameters, we use MCMC methods to generate an approximate probability distribution of polygons for the object. We then compute various probability distributions for the object, including the variance between the observed and predicted fields (an important quantity in the MCMC method), the area, the center of area, and the occupancy probability (the probability that a spatial point lies within the object). In addition, we compare probabilities of different models using parallel tempering, a technique which also mitigates trapping in local optima that can occur in certain model geometries.\nWe apply our method to several synthetic data sets generated from objects of varying shape and location. We also analyze a natural data set collected across the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in New Mexico, where the object (i.e. the air below the bridge) is known and the canyon is approximately 2D. Although there are many ways to view results, the occupancy probability proves quite powerful. We also find that the choice of the container is important. In particular, large containers should be avoided, because the more closely a container confines the object, the better the predictions match properties of object.",

            "abstract": "The fate of CH4 released from thawing subsea permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) is unclear. In recent years, interest has focused on the possibility of large emissions of CH4 directly to the atmosphere from this remote area. It is uncertain how high those emissions are and whether they are primarily of biogenic or thermogenic nature, or some combination of sources.\nThe SWERUS-C3 expedition onboard the Swedish icebreaker Oden during July-August 2014 sought to document possible CH4 release from subsea permafrost, and to understand mechanisms and magnitudes of such CH4 being released to the atmosphere. During the first leg of the expedition continuous high-resolution measurements were made to determine the in situ concentrations of CH4 in both the atmosphere and surface water.\nDuring SWERUS-C3, several underwater gas flares were found within the ESAS region showing elevated CH4 concentrations collocated in the surface waters. Here we focus on one seep area, a so-called “mega-flare” site, in the central Laptev Sea. Over individual gas flares of this site the surface water concentration of CH4 reached as high as 200ppm. The atmospheric concentrations of CH4 briefly (< 1 s) reached a maximum of ~3.2 ppm. More typical atmospheric values around the seeps were between 1.9-2.0 ppm (background values were approximately 1.88 ppm). However, such peak concentrations in both air and water were highly localized, returning to background levels within a few hundred meters of the source seeps.\nTogether with continuous high-precision eddy-covariance measurements that were made during the SWERUS-C3 expedition, the combined dataset allows an intensive analysis these highly inhomogeneous gas flares. This gives the opportunity to calculate accurate high-resolution CH4 fluxes and thus give a better insight into the current rates of subsea CH4 outgassing reaching the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Although the mixing of fluids within a porous media is a common process in natural and industrial systems, how the degree of mixing depends on the miscibility of multiple phases is poorly characterized. Often, the direct consequence of miscible mixing is the modification of the resident fluid (brine and hydrocarbons) rheological properties. We investigate supercritical (sc)CO2 displacement and mixing processes in a three-phase system (scCO2, oil, and H2O) using a microfluidics experimental system that accommodates the high pressures and temperatures encountered in fossil fuel extraction operations. The miscibility of scCO2 with the resident fluids, low with aqueous solutions and high with hydrocarbons, impacts the mixing processes that control sweep efficiency in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and the unlocking of the system in unconventional oil and gas extraction. Using standard volume-averaging techniques we upscale the aqueous phase saturation to the field-scale (i.e., Darcy scale) and interpret the results as a simpler two-phase system. This process allows us to perform a statistical analysis to quantify i) the degree of heterogeneity in the system resulting from the immiscible H2O and ii) how that heterogeneity impacts mixing between scCO2 and oil and their displacement. Our results show that when scCO2 is used for miscible displacement, the presence of an aqueous solution, which is common in secondary and tertiary EOR and unconventional oil and gas extraction, strongly impacts the mixing of scCO2 with the hydrocarbons due to low scCO2-H2O miscibility. H2O, which must be displaced advectively by the injected scCO2, introduces spatio-temporal variability into the system that acts as a barrier between the two miscibile fluids. This coupled with the effect of viscosity contrast, i.e., viscous fingering, has an impact on the mixing of the more miscible pair.",

            "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to present the status of the CryoSat (CS) Mission over the ocean. Launched in 2010, the polar-orbiting CS was primarily developed to measure the changes in the thickness of polar sea ice and the elevation of the ice sheets. Going beyond its ice-monitoring objective, CS is also a valuable source of data for the oceanographic community. The satellite’s radar altimeter can indeed measure high resolution Sea-Level Height (SSH), Significant Wave Height (SWH), and Wind Speed (WS) from the open-ocean to the coast. To enable their full scientific and operational exploitation, the CS ocean products continuously evolve and need to be thoroughly validated via science-oriented diagnostics based on in situ data, models and other satellite missions. In support to ESA, the CS ocean validation team (NOCS, ECMWF and TU Delft/DEOS) conjointly conduct these analysis for both the near real time and offline products for the SSH, the SWH, and the WS parameters. The SSH is validated at the coast against sea level measured by a set of carefully selected tide gauges, HF radars and with the help of tools from the Radar Altimetry Database System (RADS). In the open ocean, the SSH is compared globally with the steric heights derived from ARGO temperature and salinity profiles. Near real time WS and SWH are monitored and validated against the corresponding parameters from ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS), the Wavewatch III model, in-situ buoy and platform instruments as well as from other altimetric missions (Jason2 and Saral/AltiKa). Numerical experiments with CS SWH data assimilation have been recently conducted, showing positive impact on ECMWF model analysis and forecasts and leading to the operational assimilation of CS SWH in IFS. Based on the outcomes from these analysis and the scientific exploitations of CS over the ocean, ESA intends to upgrade the CryoSat Ocean processing chain for 2016.",

            "abstract": "We report first observations of sounder stimulated and naturally occurring fast Z mode (ZM) cavity noise detected by the Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) on the IMAGE satellite. The fast Z mode cavity noise is a banded, structure-less radio emission trapped inside fast Z mode cavities, which are characterized by a minimum (fz,min) in fast Z mode cut-off frequency (fz) along a geomagnetic field line [Gurnett et al., JGR, 1983]. Fast Z mode waves reflect at fz ~ f, where f is the wave frequency. Waves in the frequency range fz,min < f < fz,max, where fz,max is the maximum fz above fz,min altitude, are trapped within the cavity as they bounce back and forth between reflection altitudes (fz ~ f) above and below the fz,min altitude. These trapped waves will be observed by a satellite passing through the cavity. The observed cavity noise lower cutoff is at the local Z mode cut-off frequency (fz,Sat) and the upper cut-off is presumably close to fz,max. The cavity noise is observed typically inside the plasmasphere. Comparison of cavity noise as observed on the plasmagram obtained during active sounding with that observed on the dynamic spectra obtained from the interspersed passive wave measurements indicate that the cavity noise is either stimulated by transmissions from the sounder (RPI) or is of natural origin. The sounder stimulated noise is often accompanied by fast Z mode echoes. The naturally occurring cavity noise is observed on both the plasmagram and the dynamic spectra. We believe the stimulated cavity noise is generated due to scattering from small-scale irregularities of waves transmitted by RPI. One potential candidate for the source of naturally occurring Z mode cavity noise is the ring current electrons that can generate fast ZM waves via higher order cyclotron resonance [Nishimura et al., Earth Planets Space, 2007].",

The relationship between AM and the first EAWM mode remained stable during 1958 to 2013, whereas that between SPV and the second EAWM mode increased since the late 1980s. The SPV-related circulation and planetary wave activities are intensified in the latter period. We suggested that this change might be caused by the global warming and ozone depletion.",

            "abstract": "The transition of the German energy market towards renewable energy sources, e.g. wind or solar power, requires energy storage technologies to compensate for their fluctuating production. Large amounts of energy could be stored in georeservoirs such as porous formations in the subsurface. One possibility here is to store heat with high temperatures of up to 90°C through borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) since more than 80 % of the total energy consumption in German households are used for heating and hot water supply. Within the ANGUS+ project potential environmental impacts of such heat storages are assessed and quantified. Numerical simulations are performed to predict storage capacities, storage cycle times, and induced effects. For simulation of these highly dynamic storage sites, detailed high-resolution models are required. We set up a model that accounts for all components of the BHE and verified it using experimental data. The model ensures accurate simulation results but also leads to large numerical meshes and thus high simulation times. In this work, we therefore present a numerical model for each type of BHE (single U, double U and coaxial) that reduces the number of elements and the simulation time significantly for use in larger scale simulations. The numerical model includes all BHE components and represents the temporal and spatial temperature distribution with an accuracy of less than 2% deviation from the fully discretized model. By changing the BHE geometry and using equivalent parameters, the simulation time is reduced by a factor of ~10 for single U-tube BHEs, ~20 for double U-tube BHEs and ~150 for coaxial BHEs. Results of a sensitivity study that quantify the effects of different design and storage formation parameters on temperature distribution and storage efficiency for heat storage using multiple BHEs are then shown. It is found that storage efficiency strongly depends on the number of BHEs composing the storage site, their distance and the cycle time. The temperature distribution is most sensitive to thermal conductivity of both borehole grouting and storage formation while storage efficiency is mainly controlled by the thermal conductivity of the storage formation.",

            "abstract": "Systematic global burned area maps at coarse spatial resolution (350 m - 1 km) have been produced in the past two decades from several Earth Observation (EO) systems (including MODIS, Spot-VGT, AVHRR, MERIS), and have been extensively used in a variety of applications related to emissions estimation, fire ecology, and vegetation monitoring (Mouillot et al. 2014). There is however a strong need for moderate to high resolution (10-30 m) global burned area maps, in order to improve emission estimations, in particular on heterogeneous landscapes and for local scale air quality applications, for fire management and environmental restoration, and in support of carbon accounting (Hyer and Reid 2009; Mouillot et al. 2014; Randerson et al. 2012).\nFires causes a non-permanent land cover change: the ash and charcoal left by the fire can be visible for a period ranging from a few weeks in savannas and grasslands ecosystems, to over a year in forest ecosystems (Roy et al. 2010). This poses a major challenge for designing a global burned area mapping system from moderate resolution (10-30 m) EO data, due to the low revisit time frequency of the satellites (Boschetti et al. 2015). As a consequence, a quantitative assessment of the permanence of the spectral signature of burned areas at global scale is a necessary step to assess the feasibility of global burned area mapping with moderate resolution sensors.\nThis study presents a global analysis of the post-fire reflectance of burned areas, using the MODIS MCD45A1 global burned area product to identify the location and timing of burning, and the MO(Y)D09 global surface reflectance product to retrieve the time series of reflectance values after the fire. The result is a spatially explicit map of persistence of burned area signal, which is then summarized by landcover type, and by fire zone using the subcontinental regions defined by Giglio et al. (2006).",

We explore the stability of the inter-station cross-correlation to detect different periods of sustained emission from seismic energy. The main idea of this approach is that cross-correlation waveforms computed from a wavefield emitted by a seismic source from a fixed position remain stable during the period when this source is acting. The detected periods of seismic emission correspond to different episodes of activity of volcanoes: Klyuchevskoy, Tolbachik, Shiveluch, and Kizimen. For Klyuchevskoy and Tolbachik whose recent eruptions are mostly effusive, the detected seismic signals correspond to typical volcanic tremor, likely caused by degassing processes. For Shiveluch and Kizimen producing more silicic lavas, the observed seismic emission often consists of many repetitive long period (LP) seismic events that might be related to the extrusion of viscous magmas. We develop an approach for automatic detection of these individual LP events in order to characterize variations of their size and recurrence in time.",

            "abstract": "The East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) hosts large methane (CH4) deposits in the form of gas hydrates, gas pockets within subsea permafrost and in deeper reservoirs. For over a decade, annual expeditions have documented methane releases into the water column in large parts of this region. However, there is still insufficient knowledge of which pools are releasing the methane – one important piece of information required for a deeper understanding of the system and towards predicting future releases. A powerful tool for quantifying the relative contribution of releases from different sources is multi-dimensional isotope analysis of CH4 in the water column. Using the full triple isotope characterization (δ13C-CH4, δD-CH4, Δ14C-CH4) allows deconvolution of CH4 sources between thermogenic and biogenic origins and of different reservoir ages.\nDuring the SWERUS-C3 expedition in summer 2014 we investigated the distribution of dissolved methane and its isotope signatures in the water column along the outer ESAS and its adjacent slope and ridges. Over 1500 samples for CH4 concentration from high-resolution vertical profiles (up to 12 depths) were analyzed onboard; 900 samples were taken for stable isotopes analysis; and a total of 80 larger water samples were taken at selected locations for Δ14C-CH4 analysis. CH4 was extracted from these samples onboard using custom-built CH4-stripping systems and stored in absorbent traps for further processing and radiocarbon analysis onshore.\nOne focus was to probe CH4 sources in seep areas, identified by a combination of geophysical features in the sediment, observation of bubbles in the water column and measured CH4 profiles. Here we present triple isotope data from inside and outside seep areas of the outer Laptev Sea and source-apportionment for this region. Dissolved methane concentration there reached up to 1400nM. Stable isotopes results in near bottom waters are rather enriched: Initial results show -142 to -133‰ vs SMOW for δD-CH4 and -63 to -33 ‰ vs VPDB for δ13C-CH4, plus δ13C-CH4 values of up to + 22‰ at two stations.",

Residential emissions are dominated by the combustion of solid fuels which are the primary energy source for nearly half the world’s population. Despite this importance, residential emissions are poorly quantified, as are their impacts on air quality and climate. We used a global aerosol microphysics model to simulate the impact of residential emissions on atmospheric aerosol in the year 2000, and evaluated simulated concentrations against surface observations of aerosol mass and number. Residential emissions make the largest contributions to surface particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in East Asia, South Asia and Eastern Europe, matching regions of greatest emissions. We used concentration response functions to estimate a global annual excess adult (> 30 years of age) premature mortality due to residential emissions of between 113, 300 and 827, 000 when uncertainties in both residential emissions and health effects of PM2.5 were accounted for. Premature mortality was greatest in Asia, with China and India accounting for 50% of simulated global excess mortality. Using an offline radiative transfer model, we show that residential emissions exerted a global annual mean direct radiative effect of between -66 mW m-2 and +21 mW m-2, accounting for uncertainties in emissions flux and assumed ratio of carbonaceous and sulphur emissions. Residential emissions exerted a negative global annual mean first aerosol indirect effect of between -52 mW m-2 and -16 mW m-2, which was found to be sensitive to the assumed size distribution of carbonaceous emissions. Our results demonstrate that reducing residential combustion emissions would have substantial benefits for human health through reductions in ambient PM2.5 concentrations.",

The mission involves two satellites in a loosely controlled tandem formation, with a micro-wave link measuring the inter-satellites distance variation. Earth’s mass distribution non-uniformities cause variations of the inter-satellite distance. This variation is measured to recover gravity, after subtracting the non-gravitational contributors, as the residual drag. ONERA (the French Aerospace Lab) is developing, manufacturing and testing electrostatic accelerometers measuring this residual drag applied on the satellites.\nThe accelerometer is composed of two main parts: the Sensor Unit (including the Sensor Unit Mechanics – SUM - and the Front-End Electronic Unit - FEEU) and the Interface Control Unit - ICU. In the Accelerometer Core, located in the Sensor Unit Mechanics, the proof mass is levitated and maintained at the center of an electrode cage by electrostatic forces. Thus, any drag acceleration applied on the satellite involves a variation on the servo-controlled electrostatic suspension of the mass. The voltage on the electrodes providing this electrostatic force is the output measurement of the accelerometer.\nThe impact of the accelerometer defaults (geometry, electronic and parasitic forces) leads to bias, misalignment and scale factor error, non-linearity and noise. Some of these accelerometer defaults are characterized by tests with micro-gravity pendulum bench on ground and with drops in ZARM catapult.\nThe Critical Design Review was achieved successfully on September 2014. The Engineering Model (EM) was integrated and tested successfully, with ground levitation, drops, Electromagnetic Compatibility and thermal vacuum. The integration of the two Flight Models was done on July 2015. The tests will be achieved from July to November 2015. The results of the Engineering Model and Flight Models tests will be presented.",

The simulated results indicated that:\n(1)Simulated Wenchuan earthquake ground motion (PGA) response and the main characteristics of the response spectrum are very similar to those of the real Wenchuan earthquake records. (2)Wenchuan earthquake ground motion (PGA) and the response spectra of the Plain are much greater than that of the left Mountain area because of the low velocity of the shallow surface media and the basin effect of the Chengdu basin structure. Simultaneously, (3) the source rupture process (inversion) with far-field P-wave, GPS data and InSAR information and the Longmenshan Front Fault (source rupture process) are taken into consideration in GMS numerical simulation, significantly different waveform and frequency component of the ground motion are obtained, though the strong motion waveform is distinct asymmetric, which should be much more real. It indicated that the Longmenshan Front Fault may be also involved in seismic activity during the long time(several minutes) Wenchuan earthquake process. (4) Simulated earthquake records in Hanyuan region are indeed very strong, which reveals source mechanism is one reason of Hanyuan intensity abnormaly.",

            "abstract": "Rock magnetism explains how a rock becomes magnetized and retains its magnetization over geologic time intervals. A wealth of information has been collected on the magnetic properties of constituent minerals. Rock magnetic methods are amongst the most sensitive in detecting iron minerals in natural or synthetic materials. However, several fundamental topics are still inadequately understood. These include the theories of multi-domain magnetism and the depositional or post-depositional acquisition of magnetism in sediments. A serious problem in working with natural materials is the variability of physical properties due to differences in composition and grain size, and interactions between grains. Great advances have been made in the synthesis of iron nanoparticles, thus controlled systems offer a key to gaining new insights into the role that physical parameters play in bulk magnetization behavior. Better models can be constructed in a system when only a few physical factors play a role. Information from these types of studies provides the basis for a better understanding of natural systems. For example, they clarify how environmental conditions affect iron mineralogy and the role of diagenetic processes in the acquisition of remanence in a sediment, and they explain conditions that lead to the growth of ferromagnetic minerals in relation to remagnetization. Experimental results have advanced our understanding of the single-crystal anisotropy of minerals and how these contribute to the total anisotropy in a rock. The combination of deformation experiments and their effects on magnetic anisotropy can provide new insights into ferromagnetic textures, which may play a role in the deflection of remanence in inclination flattening. Future progress in these fields will depend on a closer alliance between experiment, theory and modeling.",

            "abstract": "The Bengal basin is situated in a complex tectonic zone where the Indian-Eurasian Plates and Indian-Burmese Plates are colliding. This region is known for some of the largest intra-continental seismic events of the last 500 years, the 1548 Bengal earthquake of magnitude M>8?, the 1762 Arakan earthquake of magnitude M>8?, the 1897 Shillong earthquakes of magnitude Ms 8.7, the 1918 Srimangal earthquake of magnitude Ms 7.6 and the 1950 Assam earthquake of magnitude Mw 8.6. The source faults of these events and whether these large earthquakes occurred on faults that reached the surface or reminded blind remain controversial. The Bengal basin still needs to be better understood in terms of active faulting and seismicity.\nThe Eastern boundary of Bengal basin is marked by numerous NS trending folds of the Indo-Burma Ranges.\nWe focused on the Raghunandan Anticline, NE Bengal basin, a broad, asymmetric, growing ramp anticline, steep west-facing front and bounded westwards by a steep tectonic scarp truncating gently east dipping Quaternary sandstone beds. The scarp morphology is suggestive of a still preserved co-seismic free face above a colluvial wedge. We carried out more than 20 topographic profiles to document the precise height and shape of this 12-15 m high scarp (above alluvial surface) and to survey a set of uplifted alluvial terraces located along the Shahapur River behind the scarp. The analysis of the topographic profiles around the Shajibazar area reveals the presence of 5 alluvial terraces hanging 3 m to 19 m above Shahapur River bed. T1 and T2 terraces are the best-preserved terraces on both sides of the Shahapur River. C14 and Be 10 ages allow to date the lowest abandonned terrace and to estimate the uplift rate of this area.",

            "abstract": "Dawn Framing Camera images of Ceres’ surface indicate that tectonic processes have played an important role in the surface formation history and alterations. We study structures expected to be the result of tectonic deformation and crustal stresses, which may enable us to reconstruct the formation process of the surface and the topographic signature. Tectonic features on Ceres such as troughs, ridges, scarps, fractures, depressions and domes are analogous to those on other planetary bodies like Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa and Mercury.\nComparing these surface features will provide additional information about possible scenarios of crustal formation on Ceres.\nFirst investigations show that craters, like Urvara (46°S and 249°E), display sets of trenches radiating from the craters interior. They were likely formed by extensional tectonics linked to the impact. Similar features were also found on Mercury’s surface. It is expected that other tectonic deformations on Ceres also influence the appearance of craters and crater walls. Comparatively small scale fissures on Ceres’ surface, frequently arranged subparallel, seem to appear in terrain that looks smooth in the images. Fractures, cracks and scarps on Ceres can be found on Enceladus, Europa and Mercury in similar patterns. The “tiger stripes” on Enceladus are possible large scale analogous. Ridges on Europa, Enceladus and Ganymede are lineaments that dominate their entire surface. Those on Ceres’ however, are more irregularly shaped and less distinct. On Ceres surface troughs seem to be relatively rare. However, they show similarities to troughs on Enceladus and Mercury, and could also be related to those on Europa and Ganymede. Domes are distributed over Ceres’ entire surface and have a relatively regular shape. Analogous exist on Europa (relatively irregular or with halos) and Ganymede in the crater interiors.",

            "abstract": "No two El Niño events are alike and understanding this diversity is a current challenge for the ENSO research community. A number of recent studies point out the key role of the atmosphere in ENSO dynamics and we here review to what extent the related processes can be at the root of El Niño diversity, including extremes. The atmosphere impacts ENSO via different mechanisms. Intraseasonal variability, and namely westerly and easterly wind event play a key role in all phase of ENSO. Thermodynamical feedbacks, via surface heat fluxes, and dynamical feedbacks, via the wind stress response to SST anomalies, are also central. Errors and biases in the hydrological cycle in models may be linked to differences in ENSO feedbacks from both turbulent and radiative surface fluxes. All these have been shown to be key in climate models and at the source of a number of ENSO biases. Together with the limited observational record this is a challenge to understanding how atmosphere impacts ENSO diversity. We therefore argue the need for a process-based analysis and model evaluation to unravel this role and illustrate it in CMIP class models.",

            "abstract": "We present observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) of impacts of corotating interaction regions (CIRs) on comet 67P. Corotating interaction regions build up in the solar wind when slow flow is caught up by faster flow. A pressure pulse is then formed, which propagates outward in interplanetary space and impacts on e.g. planets, moons and comet in its path. In the interval October to December 2014 four such CIRs are traced from Earth (using ACE) to Mars (using Mars Express and MAVEN) and to comet 67P (using Rosetta). As the CIRs impact on the cometary coma the ionospheric low-energy plasma density in the ionosphere increases by roughly one order of magnitude in the first three events. The increased density is possibly caused by sweeping up of more upstream plasma in combination with increased impact ionization and charge exchange processes. Increased fluxes of ~100 eV electrons are observed concurrently and the magnetic field strength typically doubles as more interplanetary magnetic field piles up around of the comet.",

            "abstract": "Global surface temperatures have increased less rapidly since the early 2000s than during the previous decades. This slowdown in global surface evolution (also called hiatus) has several possible causes, ranging from decreased net radiative forcing to internal rearrangement of heat inside the ocean between the surface and the deep ocean. Several studies have favored the latter explanation and have invoked different ocean basins as potential warming sinks. Here we investigate the regional distribution of the reported temperature slowdown during the 2003-2013 decade. We successively analyse land and ocean surface temperatures using different data sets. For the ocean, we use sea surface temperature data as well as ocean thermal expansion of the upper 100 m estimated with Argo measurements and ocean reanalyses. We find that during the study period (largely representative of the hiatus), land surface temperatures have increased at a rate not significantly lower than over the previous century. For the oceans, we estimated the surface temperature (and 0-100 m thermal expansion) in different latitudinal bands and different ocean basins and found that the most of the observed slowdown of the global mean surface temperature comes from the eastern tropical Pacific (20°S-20°N, 80°W-150°W). This region shows a significant cooling during the 2003-2013 decade, not seen elsewhere. Looking at seasonal variations, we also found that cooling dominantly occurs during the December-January-February season. Comparison of the eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature cooling with the global mean shows that the observed pause in the global mean surface temperature evolution of the recent years can be largely explained by this region. This result is well compatible with some recently proposed mechanisms of heat redistribution inside the ocean.",

The magnitude of zonal variations in climate thus changes with the amplitude of stationary eddies. We investigate the response of stationary eddies to climate change across a wide range of climates in an idealized GCM using two types of zonally asymmetric forcing: an extratropical Gaussian mountain and equatorial ocean heat-flux convergence. Orographically forced stationary eddies respond non-monotonically with global-mean temperature in response to changes in zonal surface winds and surface-pressure gradients. The Walker circulation forced by equatorial ocean heat-flux convergence as well as the Rossby waves forced by this divergent flow decrease monotonically throughout the range of climates as the moisture content of the atmosphere increases. We investigate changes in zonally anomalous precipitation minus evaporation (P - E) associated with these stationary-eddy changes. We find that stationary-eddy changes are large such that 'wet gets wetter, dry gets drier' ideas do not apply locally. We find that the zonal variance of P - E is closer to following the changes in atmospheric moisture content, but departs from this expectation within the Walker circulation and in very warm climates, showing a decrease in the amplitude of stationary-eddy circulations in these cases. The ideas demonstrated with these idealized experiments apply to CMIP5 simulations as well, where the zonal variance of P - E increases slower than atmospheric moisture content throughout a range of latitudes indicating a slowdown of stationary-eddy circulations.",

            "abstract": "The DFDP-2B borehole drilled at Whataroa, New Zealand, provides a first-hand rare opportunity to investigate the damage pattern next to a major active fault. It was drilled along more than 893 m (820 m TVD) within hanging-wall protomylonites and mylonites. The interval between 264 m and 886 m (measured depth) was intensively investigated by wireline logging. Notably, electrical laterolog data were recorded over almost 3 km of cumulative logs, providing a homogeneous, uniformly sampled recording of the electrical properties of the borehole wall.\nThe laterolog tool measures resistivity with two different electrode configurations, and hence achieves two different depths of penetration. Numerical simulations of the tool’s response show that the true resistivity of the rock is close to the deep resistivity measurement, which in DFDP-2 varies between 300 Ω.m and 700 Ω.m. The shallow resistivity is about 75% of this value, as it is more sensitive to the presence of conductive borehole fluid. However, the large borehole diameter (averaging 8.5 inch = or 21.59 cm) only partially explains this value. The strong anisotropy suggested by laboratory measurements on outcrop samples also contributes to the separation between deep and shallow resistivity.\nThe shallow and deep resistivities exhibit many significant drops that are coincident with the presence of fractures detected in borehole televiewer data. More than 700 electrical anomalies have been manually picked. The major ones are correlated with attenuation of the sonic data and sometimes with anomalies in fluid conductivity (temperature and conductivity). Their frequency gradually increases with depth, reaching a plateau below 700 m. This increase with depth may be related to closer proximity to the Alpine Fault.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the deep cycling of elements hinges on characterizing the chemistry of fluids in subduction zones. Aqueous solutions dielectric properties determine their characteristics as solvents for rocks. Predicting the composition and speciation of fluid solutions at equilibrium with complex mineral assemblages has been a long lasting challenge. We have developed a model to explore the composition and speciation of metamorphic aqueous solutions to upper mantle pressure and temperature. Our model combines Gibbs free energy minimization of rock and molecular fluids with an electrostatic approach to describe solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions in the fluid phase. Using an extension of the Debye-Onsager-Kirkwood model to characterize the dielectric properties of COH solutions, we derive aqueous fluid speciation by solving the mass action and charge balance of the system. This framework is applied to various slab lithologies. We find, e.g., that the pH of carbonated basalts and pelites is alkaline, i.e. ~2-2.5 pH units above neutrality, in C and Cl-free fluids and shows an isothermal decrease above the albite-jadeite-quartz equilibrium, at P ~ 2 GPa. C and Chlorine (1M) decrease the alkalinity by a combined ~ 1.5 pH unit, with variations tied to the thermal structure and mineral assemblages along typical P–T paths. The results produced are compared with experimental solubility measurements on identical systems. Significant discrepancies reveal that the process of solute polymerization at elevated T and P is more general than previously recognized. Unaccounted species contain, in addition to Na, Si and Al, an important fraction of the total dissolved load of the elements K, Ca and Mg (>50% at T= 600 °C and P = 2 Ga). Finally, we show that knowledge of the acid-base properties of metamorphic fluid solutions affect the (de)coupling between C and alkali-earth mobility, and magnitude of low-T C transfers associated to carbonate dissolution through time. This shows that a better understanding of the mineral and fluid cycling of alkali and halogens in particular, are key to quantifying the deep cycling of elements such as C.",

            "abstract": "This research aims to propose a protocol for pore network quantification in sandstones applying the Optical Image Analysis (OIA) procedure, which guarantees the measurement reproducibility and its reliability. Two geological formations of sandstone, located in Spain and potentially suitable for CO2 sequestration, were selected for this study: a) the Cretaceous Utrillas unit, at the base of the Cenozoic Duero Basin and b) a Triassic unit at the base of the Cenozoic Guadalquivir Basin. Sandstone samples were studied before and after the CO2 experimental injection using Optical and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), while the quantification of petrographic changes was done with OIA.\nThe first phase of the rersearch consisted on a detailed mineralogical and petrographic study of the sandstones (before and after CO2-injection), for which we observed thin sections. Later, the methodological and experimental processes of the investigation were focused on i) adjustment and calibration of OIA tools; ii) data acquisition protocol based on image capture with different polarization conditions (synchronized movement of polarizers), using 7 images of the same mineral scene (6 in crossed polarizer and 1 in parallel polarizer); and iii) automated identification and segmentation of pore in 2D mineral images, generating applications by executable macros. Finally, once the procedure protocols had been, the compiled data was interpreted through an automated approach and the qualitative petrography was carried out.\nThe quantification of changes in the pore network through OIA (porosity increase ≈ 2.5%) has allowed corroborate the descriptions obtained by SEM and microscopic techniques, which consisted in an increase in the porosity when CO2 treatment occurs. Automated-image identification and quantification of minerals, pores and textures together with petrographic analysis can be applied to improve pore system characterization in sedimentary rocks. This research offers numerical support to quantify geometric and densitometric mineralogical parameters that would complement the traditional petrographic procedures.",

            "abstract": "Based on earlier studies that have shown Saturn's middle magnetosphere to contain turbulent magnetic field fluctuations, we analyze the spatial and temporal variations of these magnetic fluctuations, their relative spectral power on kinetic scales, the spectral index of ion kinetic turbulence, and turbulent heating rate as a function of local time and Saturn longitude (SLS4-South). The region of study is Saturn's plasma sheet at a distance of 6-20 Rs. The data set consists of magnetic field data measured during 97 orbits (Revolutions) from the equatorial phases of Cassini covering nine years from 2004 to 2012. We find asymmetries in the magnetosphere with enhanced spectral power around noon and ~270° SLS4-S longitude (for 2004-2010 data), which leads to an increased turbulent heating rate in these regions. Analysis of single orbits reveals that the heating rate of 63% of all analyzed orbits is significantly (p<0.01) modulated with a sinusoid of order m=1. For these orbits the turbulent heating rate peaks at a mean longitude of 300°±90°. A significant modulation of the turbulent heating rate is predominantly observed during times when Cassini is located near pre-midnight. This is consistent with an increased heating rate during SKR maximum. The mean spectral index of ion kinetic turbulent spectra for distances of r=9-20 Rs is κ=2.6±0.3 and shows less asymmetry. In total, the turbulent heating amounts to 140-210 GW in Saturn's plasma sheet from 6-20 Rs.",

            "abstract": "There is concern that high elevations may be warming more rapidly than lower elevations, but there is a lack of observational data from weather stations in the high mountains. One alternative data source is satellite LST (Land Surface Temperature) which has extensive spatial coverage. This study compares instantaneous values of LST (1030 and 2230 local solar time) as measured by the MODIS MOD11A2 product at 1 km resolution with equivalent screen level air temperatures (in the same pixel) measured from a transect of 22 in situ weather stations across Kilimanjaro ranging in elevation from 990 to 5803 m. Data consists of 11 years on the SW slope and 3 years on the NE slope, equating to >500 and ~140 octtads (8-day periods) respectively. Results show substantial differences between LST and local air temperature, sometimes up to 20C. During the day the LST tends to be higher than air temperature and the reverse is true at night. The differences show large variance, particularly during the daytime, and tend to increase with elevation, particularly on the NE slope of the mountain which faces the sun when the daytime observations are taken (1030 LST). Differences between LST and air temperature are larger in the dry seasons (JF and JJAS), and reduce when conditions are more cloudy. Systematic relationships with cloud cover and vegetation characteristics (as measured by NDVI and MAIAC for the same pixel) are displayed. More vegetation reduces daytime surface heating above the air temperature, but this relationship weakens with elevation. Nighttime differences are more stable and show no relationship with vegetation indices. Therefore the predictability of the LST/air temperature differences reduces at high elevations and it is therefore much more challenging to use satellite data at high elevations to complement in situ air temperature measurements for climate change assessments, especially for daytime maximum temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Benthic foraminifera have been used as proxies for the prevailing conditions at the sediment–water interface. Their distribution patterns are thought to facilitate reconstruction of past environmental conditions. Variations of bottom water oxygenation can be traced by the downcore distribution of benthic foraminifera and some of their morphological characters. Being one of the strongest and most pronounced OMZs in today’s world oceans, the Peruvian OMZ is a key area to study such variations in relation with changing climate. Spatial changes or an extension of the OMZ through time and space are investigated using sediment cores from the lower OMZ boundary. We focus on time intervals Late Holocene, Early Holocene, Bølling Allerød, Heinrich-Stadial 1 and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to investigate changes in bottom-water oxygen and redox conditions. The recent distributions of benthic foraminiferal assemblages provide background data for an interpretation of the past conditions. Living benthic foraminiferal faunas from the Peruvian margin are structured with the prevailing bottom-water oxygen concentrations today (Mallon et al., 2012). Downcore distribution of benthic foraminiferal assemblages showed fluctuations in the abundance of the indicator species depicting variations and a decreasing trend in bottom water oxygen conditions since the LGM. In addition, changes in bottom-water oxygen and nitrate concentrations are reconstructed for the same time intervals by the pore density in tests of Planulina limbata and Bolivina spissa (Glock et al., 2011), respectively. The pore densities also indicate a trend of higher oxygen and nitrate concentrations in the LGM compared to the Holocene. Combination of both proxies provide information on past bottom-water conditions and changes of oxygen concentrations for the Peruvian margin.\nGlock et al., 2011: Environmental influences on the pore density of Bolivina spissa (Cushman), Journal of Foraminiferal Research, v. 41, no. 1, p. 22–32.\nMallon et al., 2012: The response of benthic foraminifera to low-oxygen conditions of the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone, in ANOXIA, pp.305-322.",

Because of the lack of observations, the lake water balance and its change are far from well understood. Evaporation is a component of lake water balance, and this study quantifies its magnitude, decadal change, and its contribution to water balance change of Lake Nam Co, one of the largest lakes (with an area of about 2000 km2 and a mean depth of about 40 m) in the Tibetan Plateau. The lake temperature and evaporation are simulated by Flake model. The simulated lake temperature during 2000 to 2012 is validated against MODIS observations and its mean bias error (model simulation minus satellite retrieval) and root mean square error are -0.44 ºC and 3.37 ºC during the day, and 0.02 ºC and 2.27 ºC at night, respectively. The simulated latent heat flux and sensible heat flux are in good agreement with Bowen-ratio-derived ones in 2012, indicating that the simulation results are reasonable. The simulated long-term mean annual evaporation is about 750-850 mm, and this value is much less than potential evaporation estimated with Penman-Monteith equation. The simulated annual evaporation over 1980 ~ 2012 displays a complex decadal oscillation, mainly due to the change in energy-related terms (air temperature, solar radiation and atmospheric long-wave radiation). The mean lake evaporation since the late 1990s is slightly greater than before, and thus evaporation change played a role in suppressing the recent expansion of Nam Co.",

            "abstract": "We used the RAMS-based Forest Large Eddy Simulations (RAFLES) to evaluate the sensitivity of eddy covariance measurements to land-surface discontinuity. While the sensitivity of eddy covariance measurements to surface heterogeneity is well known, it is, in most cases, no feasible to restrict measurements only to sites where the surface include undisturbed and homogeneous land cover over vast distances around the observation tower. The common approach to handle surface heterogeneity is to use a footprint model and reject observations obtained while the source of observed signal is from a mixture of land-use types, and maintain only measurements where the signal originates mostly from the land-use type of interest.\nWe simulated two scenarios - measurements of fluxes from a small forest-surrounded lake, and measurements near a forest edge. These are two very common scenarios where measurements are bound to be affected by heterogeneity – measurements in small lakes, will, by definition, be in some non-negligible proximity or the lake edge; forest edges are common in any forest, near the forest patch edge but also around disturbed patches and forest gaps.\nWe identify regions where the surface heterogeneity is creating persistent updraft or downdraft. A non-zero mean vertical wind is typically neglected in eddy-covariance measurements. We find that these circulations lead to both vertical and horizontal advection that cannot be easily measured by a single eddy-covariance tower. We identify downwind effects, which are well known, but also quantify the upwind effects. We find that surface-induced circulations may affect the flux measured from a tower up to several canopy heights ahead of the discontinuity.\nWe used the High-resolution Volatile Organic Compound Atmospheric Chemistry in Canopies (Hi-VACC) model to determine the actual measurement footprints throughout the RAFLES domain. We estimated the land-cover type distribution of the source signal at different virtual tower locations using a standard footprint model, and by explicit advection/diffusion simulations of a virtual trace scalar with Hi-VACC. We use the deviation between these two estimates to evaluate which locations are the most reliable for flux measurements and for footprint-based filtering.",

The interaction of some of these factors as the litho-structural setting, the local relief, the tectonic activity, the climatic conditions and the seismicity plays a key-role in determining large scale slope instability phenomena which display the general morphological features of deep seated gravitational deformations (DSGD). The present work aims to detect the large scale gravitational deformation and relations with the active tectonics affecting the Abruzzo Region and to provide a description of the morphologic features of the deformations by means of aerial photograph interpretation, geological/geomorphological field surveys and DInSAR data.\nThe investigated areas are morphologically characterized by significant elevation changes due to the presence of high mountain peaks, separated from surrounding depressed areas by steep escarpments, frequently represented by active faults. Consequently, relief energy favours the development of gravity-driven deformations. These deformations seem to be superimposed on and influenced by the inherited structural and tectonic pattern, related to the sin- and post-thrusting evolution. The morphological evidences of these phenomena, are represented by landslides, sackungen or rock-flows, lateral spreads and block slides. DInSAR analysis measured deformation of the large scale gravitative phenomena previously identified through aerial-photo analysis. DSGD may evolve in rapid, catastrophic mass movements and this paroxistic evolution of the deformations may be triggered by high magnitude seismic events. These assumptions point out the great importance of mapping in detail large scale slope instability phenomena in relation to the active faults, in a perspective of land-use planning such as the Abruzzo Region characterized by a high magnitude historical seismicity.",

This occurs at a time when the Planetary Science Archive (PSA) has been undergoing a complete reengineering in order to increase the accessibility of ESA’s planetary data holdings utilising the latest technologies and to significantly improve the user experience for both the specialist scientific community and general public alike.\nThe PSA must also keep on handling PDS3 data arriving to the archive from active missions (Rosetta, Mars Express, Venus Express) as well as continuing to provide access to missions that have reached the legacy phase (Huygens, SMART1, Giotto). Therefore, as part of the reengineering of the PSA, an effort has been made to map the key metadata from PDS3 and PDS4 into a common data model with the intention of providing transparency to the services that make up the new PSA, and consequently to the end user. We present how this common mapping allows the PSA to support the data deliveries from the pipelines of existing missions without the need to reprocess the PDS3 data and in addition how it should simplify the data deliveries from PDS4 missions. We review how the implementation of this data model, involving a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension, enables the new PSA to be able to provide multiple methods of interoperability used by the international community, such as PDAP (Planetary Data Access Protocol), EPN-TAP (EuroPlanet-Table Access Protocol), and GIS-enabled technologies without the user having to know in detail the underlying structure of the data format.",

            "abstract": "In this work, phenological parameters such as growth stage, calendar estimation, crop density and yield estimation for rice fields are estimated employing TanDEM-X data. Currently, crop monitoring is country-dependent. Most countries have databases based on cadastral information and annual farmer inputs. Inaccuracies are coming from wrong or missing farmer declarations and/or coarsely updated cadastral boundary definitions. This leads to inefficient regulation of the market, frauds as well as to ecological risks. An accurate crop calendar is also missing, since farmers provide estimations in advance and there is no efficient way to know the growth status over large plantations. SAR data is of particular interest for these purposes.\nThe proposed method includes two step approach including field detection and phenological state estimation. In the context of precise farming it is substantial to define field borders which are usually changing every cultivation period. Linking the SAR inherit properties to transplanting practice such as irrigation, the spatial database of rice-planted agricultural crops can be updated. Boundaries of agricultural fields will be defined in the database, and assignments of crops and sowing dates will be continuously updated by our monitoring system considering that sowing practice variously changes depending on the field owner decision. To define and segment rice crops, the system will make use of the fact that rice fields are characterized as flooded parcels separated by path networks composed by soil or rare grass. This natural segmentation is well detectable by inspecting low amplitude and coherence values of bistatic acquisitions.\nOnce the field borders are defined, the phenology estimation of crops monitored at any time is the key point of monitoring. In this aspect the wavelength and the polarization option of TanDEM-X are enough to characterize the small phenological changes. The combination of bistatic interferometry and Radiative Transfer Theory (RTT) with different polarization provides a realistic description of plants including their full morphology (stalks, tillers, leaves and panicles).",

            "abstract": "Since 2012 there has been debate about a low-yield nuclear explosion within North Korea, initially claimed to have occurred in April/May 2010 on the basis of a number of Level 5 radionuclide detections from stations of the radionuclide subnetwork of the International Monitoring System (IMS) and additional reports from similar national facilities. Whereas the announced nuclear tests in North Korea in 2006, 2009 and 2013, were clearly detected seismically, there was initially a lack of detections from the seismological component of the IMS corresponding to a possible nuclear test in 2010.\nWork published recently by Zhang and Wen in Seismological Research Letters (Jan/Feb 2015) inferring seismological evidence for an explosion in North Korea, at about 0009 hours on 12 May 2010 (UTC), has attracted further attention. Previous studies of seismicity of the North Korean test site for days prior to this date had not found any such evidence from IMS or non-IMS stations. The data used by Zhang and Wen were from stations in northeastern China about 80 to 200 km from the North Korean test site and are currently not available for open research. A search for openly-available data was undertaken, resulting in relevant waveforms obtained both from the IRIS Consortium (from a PASSCAL experiment in Northeastern China, as noted also by Ford and Walter, 2015), and from another temporary seismic deployment, also in China. The data from these stations showed signals consistent with the seismic disturbance found by Zhang and Wen. These supplementary stations thus constitute a monitoring resource providing objective data, in the present case for an event even below magnitude 2 and thus much smaller than can be monitored by the usual assets. Efforts are currently underway to use the data from these stations to investigate the compatibility of the event with other explosion-type events, or with an earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault, a transpressional plate boundary between the Australia-Pacific plates, is known to rupture periodically (200-400yr) with large magnitude earthquakes (Mw~8) and is currently nearing the end of its latest interseismic period. The hydraulic and elastic properties of fault zones influence the nature and style of earthquake rupture and associated processes; investigating these properties in Alpine Fault rocks yields insights into conditions late in the seismic cycle. We present a suite of laboratory permeability and P (Vp) and S (Vs) wave velocity measurements preformed on diverse fault rock lithologies recovered during the first phase of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP-1). DFDP-1 drilled two boreholes reaching depths of 100.6m and 151.4m and retrieved fault rocks from both the hanging wall and footwall, including ultramylonites, ultracomminuted gouges and variably foliated and unfoliated cataclasites. Drilling revealed a typical shallow fault structure: localised principal slip zones (PSZ) of gouge nested within a damage zone overprinted by a zone of alteration, a record of enhanced fluid-rock interaction. Core material was tested in three orthogonal directions, orientated relative to the down core axis and, when present, foliation. Measurements were conducted with pore pressure held at 5MPa over an effective pressure (Peff) range of 5-105MPa, equivalent to pressure conditions down to ~7km depth. Using the Pulse Transient technique permeabilities at Peff=5MPa range from 10-17 to 10-20m2, decreasing to 10-18 to 10-21m2 at Peff=105MPa. Vp and Vs decrease with increased proximity to the PSZ with Vp in the hanging wall spanning 4500-5900m/s, dropping to 3900-4200m/s at the PSZ and then increasing to 4400-5600m/s in the foot wall. Wave velocities and permeability are enhanced parallel to tectonic fabrics e.g. foliation defined by aligned phyllosillicates and quartz- feldspar clasts. These measurements constrain interseismic conditions within the Alpine Fault, a zone of damaged rock pervasively altered with phyllosilicates and carbonates.",

            "abstract": "The space weather community has recently seen major advances in the prediction of the speed and arrival time of solar coronal mass ejections at Earth and other planets. Since the start of the STEREO mission in 2006, each of the heliospheric imagers (HIs) onboard the Ahead and Behind spacecraft has successfully tracked hundreds of CMEs. The advantage of HI is that CMEs can be followed for a significant part of the inner heliosphere, and the CME evolution in direction and speed is better constrained than by coronagraphs alone. By tracking and cataloguing each of those CMEs in the EU HELCATS project, we can apply geometrical modeling (FPF, HMF, SSEF) techniques on single-spacecraft HI observations to extract the expected planetary impacts of each CME. These arrivals are then verified or refuted by in situ solar wind plasma and magnetic field observations provided by the spacecraft forming the Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO), such as Wind, ACE, Venus Express, MESSENGER, and STEREO-A/B, for which various ICME catalogues are gathered and updated in the course of HELCATS.\nA first assessment on the relationship between CME HI and in situ observations is discussed, such as occurrence rates, speeds and arrival times and magnetic field strength. We also present visualizations of the HI CME catalogue and the corresponding in situ observations.

            "abstract": "Sensor-based irrigation offers the potential to optimize water allocation in the root zone, thus maximizing crop yields while limiting water losses. Defining appropriate thresholds, e.g. for soil matric potential (SMP), to trigger irrigation is however a challenge as water stress is highly dependent on plant and site-specific conditions.\nIn a first phase, the onset of water stress was explored by growing a drip-irrigated crop of eggplant in Burkina Faso on which four different treatments were applied. Root growth, biomass and yield reductions were linked to measurements of SMP at different depths by only partially restoring the crop water needs and using different irrigation depths. In a second phase, field measurements were coupled with a numerical model using the software HYDRUS-2D. The soil water dynamics was modeled in the whole root zone in order to achieve a better understanding of the linkage between soil water distribution, spatial root distribution and root water uptake. Numerical simulations were then built to assess the impact of different SMP thresholds on plant water stress and water losses, using different irrigation depths and soil textures.\nResults show that the value of the SMP threshold is dependent on the root distribution and the sensor depth, reflecting the spatial heterogeneity of water availability in the root zone. However, the use of a single sensor at 10 cm depth led to stable thresholds independently of the soil texture. At that depth, using evolving thresholds during the plant growth, which reflects the growing root system and changes in the plant water uptake ability, water stress could be avoided. Moreover, it appeared that most water losses could be avoided before the onset of water stress, suggesting that higher thresholds may be defined to avoid water losses rather than defining plant-specific water stress values. Thresholds values ranging from -15 kPa at early growth to -40 kPa during mid-season are recommended to be used as basis of an efficient irrigation schedule for vegetable crops.",

The present work integrates sedimentary facies,14C dating, δ13C, and C/N with geologic and geomorphologic data available from literature. Twenty-eight sediment samples recorded ages ranging from 7490±50 to 41420±61514C yr B.P.. Facies analysis indicated fine to coarse grained sands with parallel lamination or cross stratification, massive or laminated muds . δ13C values are in the range of −26.504‰ to −21.812‰, and C/N ratios are in the range of 0.045 to 64.156. These indicate the organic matters have typical characteristics of mixed terrigenous and marine provenance. The results confirm an obvious land-sea interaction in the South Yellow Sea since late Pleistocene. At the depth of 18-20 m and 55.6 to 70 m corresponding to the sedimentary facies of land clay and river deposition respectively, which indicate the regression period in lower sea level, δ13C values are higher obviously. These may result from the C4 plant growing in the study area during those times. According to the 07SR03 information and relevant literature, determine the sea level fluctuations in DaBei trough area around the South Yellow Sea since late pleistocene. Transgressive and regressive were alternating since 50kaB.P.. About 20kaB. P. with the Last Glacial Maximum coming the relative sea-level dropped to -100m. With the increasing temperature, the sea level rises gradually except for the little regression during Younger Dryas period. From then on, the sea level rises rapidly with the advent of Holocene transgression, followed by the slow falling and then being relatively stable. The distribution of δ13C, and C/N with the depth of the core, together with facies associations, led to identify depositional settings related to tidal sand ridge facies, shoreland, tidal flat, land clay sedimentation, tidal flat and river deposition (from the top downward).",

Additionally, X-ray bursts observed from the ground have been discovered to be produced by negative cloud-to-ground (-CG) lightning leaders in association with stepping processes [Dwyer et al., GRL, 32, L01803, 2005]. Using numerical modeling, it has been shown that the production of thermal runaway electrons by stepping lightning leaders and their further acceleration could explain the TGF spectrum for intracloud (IC) lightning potentials above ~100 MV [Xu et al., GRL, 39, L08801, 2012] and X-ray burst spectrum for -CG lightning potentials of ~5 MV [Xu et al., GRL, 41, 7406, 2014].\nIn this work, we address the physical processes leading to X-ray bursts from -CG discharges and TGFs produced by IC discharges in a unified fashion. We show how the leader-produced photon spectrum becomes harder with increasing lightning leader potential and how it progressively converges to typical photon spectrum associated with relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREAs) in large-scale ambient electric fields for potentials greater than ~150 MV. We also demonstrate that the photon fluence in a burst is a very sharp function of the potential. This implies that only lightning leaders forming the strongest potentials can lead to the production of observable TGFs from space. We specifically study the effects of source altitudes on the results and the production of the required high potentials in lightning leaders in realistic thunderstorm charge configurations.",

            "abstract": "Thawing subsea permafrost controls methane release from the Russian Arctic shelf having a considerable impact on the climate-sensitive Arctic environment. Our recent studies revealed extensive gas release over an area of at least 7500 km2and presence of pingo-like features (PLFs), showing severe methane leakage, in the South Kara Sea in water depths >20m (Serov et al., 2015). Specifically, we detected shallow methane ebullition sites expressed in water column acoustic anomalies (gas flares and gas fronts) and areas of increased dissolved methane concentrations in bottom water, which might be sufficient sources of carbon for seawater-atmosphere exchange.\nA study of nature and source of leaking gas was focused on two PLFs, which are acoustically transparent circular mounds towering 5-9 m above the surrounding seafloor. One PLF (PLF 2) connects to biogenic gas from deeper sources, which is reflected in δ13CCH4 values ranging from -55,1‰ to -88,0‰ and δDCH4values varied from -175‰ to -246‰. Low organic matter content (0.52-1.69%) of seafloor sediments restricts extensive in situ methane production. The formation of PLF 2 is directly linked to the thawing of subsea permafrost and, possibly, decomposition of permafrost related gas hydrates. High accumulations of biogenic methane create the necessary forces to push the remaining frozen layers upwards and, therefore, form a topographic feature. We speculate that PLF 1, which shows ubiquitously low methane concentrations, is either a relict submerged terrestrial pingo, or a PLF lacking the necessary underlying methane accumulations.\nOur model of glacial-interglacial permafrost evolution supports a scenario in which subsea permafrost tapers seaward and pinches out at 20m isobaths, controlling observed methane emissions and development of PLFs.\nSerov.

Probabilistic seismic hazard map (PSH) provides the critical bases for improved building code and construction. The most serious deﬁciency in PSH assessment for the territory of Georgia is the lack of high-quality ground motion data. Due to this an initial hybrid empirical ground motion model is developed for PGA and SA at selected periods. An application of these coefficients for ground motion models have been used in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. Obtained results of seismic hazard maps show evidence that there were gaps in seismic hazard assessment and the present normative seismic hazard map needed a careful recalculation.",

This system is possible to search flight by preprogramed lines. This radioactive detecting system are tested to find intentional hidden source, The performance of detecting a source is well proved with very low flight altitude in spite of depending on the magnitude of radioelement sources. The advantage of multicopter system, one of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), is to avoid the potential of close access to a dangerous radioactive source by using fully automatic searching capability.

PCA identifies the patterns in the FACs that respond coherently to different aspects of geomagnetic activity. The region 1 and 2 current system is shown to be the most reproducible feature of the currents, followed by cusp currents associated with magnetic tension forces on newly-reconnected field lines. The cusp currents are strongly modulated by season, indicating that their strength is regulated by the ionospheric conductance at the foot of the field lines. PCA does not identify a pattern that is clearly characteristic of a substorm current wedge. Rather, a superposed epoch analysis of the currents associated with substorms demonstrates that there is not a single mode of response, but a complicated and subtle mixture of different patterns. Other interhemispheric differences are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Net primary productivity (NPP) is considered as an important indicator for forest ecosystem since the role of forest is highlighted as a stepping stone for mitigating climate change. Especially rapidly urbanizing countries which have high carbon dioxide emission have large interest in calculating forest NPP under climate change. Also maximizing carbon sequestration in forest sector has became a global goal to minimize the impacts of climate change. Therefore, the objective of this research is estimating carbon stock change under the different climate change scenarios by using G4M (Global Forestry Model) model in South Korea. We analyzed four climate change scenarios in different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). In this study we used higher resolution data (1kmx1km) to produce precise estimation on NPP from regionalized four climate change scenarios in G4M model. Finally, we set up other environmental variables for G4M such as water holding capacity, soil type and elevation. As a result of this study, temperature showed significant trend during 2011 to 2100. Average annual temperature increased more than 5℃ in RCP 8.5 scenario while 1℃ increased in RCP 2.6 scenario. Each standard deviation of the annual average temperature showed similar trend. Average annual precipitation showed similarity within four scenarios. However the standard deviation of average annual precipitation is higher in RCP8.5 scenario which indicates the ranges of precipitation is wider in RCP8.5 scenario. These results present that climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation have uncertainties in climate change scenarios. NPP has changed from 5-13tC/ha/year in RCP2.6 scenario to 9-21 tC/ha/year in RCP8.5 scenario in 2100. In addition the spatial distribution of NPP presented different trend among the scenarios. In conclusion we calculated differences in temperature and precipitation and NPP change in different climate change scenarios. This study can be applied for maximizing carbon seqestration of vegetation.",

In order to construct a plagioclase phenocryst hygrometer\noptimized for arc basalt magmas, we have conducted hydrous melting experiments of relatively primitive basalt\nfrom the Miyakejima volcano, a frontal-arc volcano in the Izu arc. As a result of the experiments, we found that the\nCa/Na partition coefficient between plagioclase and hydrous basaltic melt increases linearly with an increase in H2O\ncontent in the melts. We then compiled published geochemical data sets of relatively primitive basaltic rocks with no evidence of magma mixing and the most frequent Ca-rich plagioclase phenocrysts from 15 basaltic arc volcanoes\nincluding both frontal-arc and rear-arc volcanoes. In the 15 volcanoes studied, plagioclase phenocrysts of high anorthite\ncontent (An > 90) were commonly observed, whereas plagioclase phenocrysts in rear arc volcanoes usually had a lower\nanorthite content (90 > An > 80). In all volcanoes studied, the estimated H2O content of basaltic magma was at least\n3 wt.% H2O or higher. The magmas of volcanoes located on the volcanic front have about 5 wt.% H2O in magma\nwhereas those from the rear-arc side are slightly lower in H2O content.",

            "abstract": "The process of ice nucleation plays a crucial role for the hydrological cycle on Earth. It influences the lifetime of clouds and can be a key element in the early stages of rain initiation. Therefore, direct observations of ice nucleation events in the atmosphere are crucial for quantitative insight into this complex process. Recently, DeMott (2010) provided a general description of the ice nucleating ability of aerosol particles, thus the estimation of available ice nuclei, e.g., from lidar measurements becomes possible for the first time. On the other hand, sophisticated combined remote sensing methods like Cloudnet allow detailed insight into the properties of ice crystals originating from cloud layers. In this context, combined observations with Raman/Depolarization lidar and radar show show a high synergistic potential, because combined they provide high sensitivity to the properties of both aerosol particles and ice crystals.\nIn this work, results of a measurement campaign at the Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg, Germany are presented (Bühl, 2015). For the time period of four month a PollyXT Raman/Depolarization lidar, Doppler lidar, cloud radar and wind profiler were operated together to capture the full picture of aerosol properties, vertical motions, ice and liquid water properties in and around layered clouds. The number of ice nuclei in an aerosol layer surrounding a cloud is estimated via the parameterization of DeMott (2010). The number of ice nuclei falling from an ice cloud is estimated at the same time via radar measurements. It is shown that both quantities can be used to gain detailed, quantitative knowledge about the process of ice nucleation in layered clouds.\n",

            "abstract": "The contributions of the projected changes in soil moisture to the overall future changes in various aspects of precipitation over land areas at the end of the 21st century are quantified using the simulations from the GLACE-CMIP5 experiment. This is done by directly comparing the overall projected future changes in climate, which are partly related to changes in soil moisture, to the changes in climate that are not affected by any changes in soil moisture. As the five different climate models contributing to the experiment show quite different geographical distributions of the future changes in soil moisture as well as different magnitudes, we do not consider ensemble mean values based on the corresponding simulations with these models but rather analyze the simulations from the different models separately. We focus on the soil moisture-precipitation coupling/feedback, distinguishing between different aspects of precipitation, i.e., the intensity and frequency of daily precipitation events, the intensity of heavy daily precipitation events as well as the frequency and length of dry spells and wet spells.\nThe simulations show marked future changes in soil moisture content, with a general tendency of increases in the tropics and decreases in the subtropics as well as in the southern parts of Europe and North America. The changes in soil moisture content are found to give major contributions to the overall changes in the latent heat flux and in different aspects of precipitation. The impact of soil moisture changes is notably stronger for the frequency of daily precipitation events than for their intensity. Hence, the changes in soil moisture give stronger contributions to the overall changes in the characteristics of wet and dry spells rather than to the changes in the intensity of heavy daily precipitation events.",

Among the myriad of compounds emitted by these fires, carbon monoxide represents one of the dominant species, and due to its long lifetime, can be transported over very large distances. In the framework of the MOZAIC-IAGOS program, carbon monoxide is routinely measured since 2002 by several commercial aircraft, which provides a unique dataset of CO vertical profiles throughout troposphere. In this study, we investigate the role of vegetation fires in the strong CO anomalies observed in troposphere during the 2002-2012 period. FLEXPART backward simulations coupled with anthropogenic and biomass burning emission inventories are used to trace the geographical origin of these anomalies, which provides valuable informations on the long-range transport of vegetation fire plumes and their subsequent impact on downwind regions.",

The Initiative arose in response to a recognized need to make free and (or) open-source water-resources software more widely accessible to Africa’s water sector. A kit of software is being developed to provide African water authorities, teachers, university lecturers, and researchers with a set of programs that can be enhanced and (or) applied to the development of efficient and sustainable management strategies for Africa’s water resources. The Initiative brings together experts from the many fields of water resources to identify software that might be included in the kit, to oversee an objective process for selecting software for the kit, and to engage in training and other modes of capacity building to enhance dissemination of the software. To date, teams of experts from the fields of wastewater treatment, groundwater hydrology, surface-water hydrology, and data management have been formed to identify relevant software from their respective fields. An initial version of the HOPE Software Kit was released in late August 2014 and consists of the STOAT model for wastewater treatment developed by the Water Research Center (United Kingdom) and the MODFLOW-2005 model for groundwater-flow simulation developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The Kit is available on the UNESCO HOPE website (\nhttp://www.hope-initiative.net/\n).\nTraining in the theory and use of MODFLOW-2005 is planned in southern Africa in conjunction with UNESCO’s study of the Kalahari-Karoo/Stampriet Transboundary Aquifer, which extends over an area that includes parts of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, and in support of the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 FREEWAT project (FREE and open source software tools for WATer resource management; see the UNESCO HOPE website).",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is a key state variable that controls water and mass fluxes in soil-plant systems and is variable in space and time. Over the last year’s, hydrogeophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) have been used to determine electromagnetic properties as proxies for soil water content (SWC). Here, we combined zero-offset-profiles (ZOP) GPR measurements within multiple horizontal minirhizotubes at different depths to determine the spatial and temporal variability of SWC under a winter wheat stand at the Selhausen test site (Germany). We studied spatio-temporal variations of SWC under three different treatments: rainfed, irrigated and sheltered. We acquired 15 time-lapse ZOP GPR dataset during the growing season of the wheat in the rhizotron facility using horizontal boreholes with a separation of 0.75m and a length of 6m at six depths between 0.1-1.2m. The obtained radar velocities were converted to SWC using the 4-phase volumetric complex refractive index model. SWC values obtained using standard ray-based processing methods were not reliable close to the surface (0.1-0.2m depth) because of the inference of the critically refracted air wave and the direct wave through the subsurface. Therefore, we implemented a full-waveform inversion that uses accurate 3D forward modeling of GPRMax that incorporates the air and soil interactions. The shuffled complex evolution (SCE) method allowed us to retrieve quantitative medium properties that explained the measured data with a R² of at least 0.95, and improved SWC estimates at all depths. The final SWC distributions for wet and dry conditions showed that the vertical variability is significantly larger than the lateral variability caused by strong influence of precipitation and irrigation events.",

Combining the crop water stress index (CWSI) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables detection of which specific areas within a cultivated field that requires irrigation to ensure healthy growing plants. In this study remotely sensed, high resolution surface temperatures are collected with a thermal camera onboard an UAV. Temperatures are used to calculate spatially distributed, high resolution CWSI maps over a barley field during growing seasons 2014 and 2015. In early stages of the barley growing season, surface temperatures are an ensemble of both soil and canopy temperatures. Canopy temperatures are extracted using leaf area index and the two source energy balance modelling scheme. This approach enables CWSI calculations for homogeneous and evenly distributed crops (such as barley) during early as well as late stages of a growing season. CWSI maps are calculated using both an empirical and an analytical approach and are compared and validated against modelled canopy conductance and transpiration rates.",

Assumptions or model estimates are then required to extend clear-sky estimates to all-sky conditions. Aerosol radiative effects in cloudy skies depend in part on the relative vertical distribution of aerosol and cloud. This represents a major uncertainty in model estimates of aerosol forcing, as the aerosol vertical distribution is poorly constrained and there is a large diversity between models. We have used the CERES-MODIS-CALIPSO-CloudSat (C3M) product to estimate global and regional all-sky aerosol DRE. C3M contains profiles of SW and LW irradiances computed from instantaneous aerosol and cloud profiles from CALIPSO and CloudSat, and collocated MODIS cloud data, all matched to CERES footprints. Aerosol absorption is estimated using a combination of aerosol type information from CALIOP and the MATCH aerosol transport model. Diurnally averaged fluxes are derived and used to estimate annual and seasonal mean DRE.\nGlobal mean all-sky SW TOA DRE is found to be about 2/3 of the clear-sky DRE, due to a combination of cloud-masking of low-altitude aerosol and enhanced warming of absorbing aerosol above cloud. Substantial regional variations in the ratio of all-sky to clear-sky forcing are seen depending on aerosol type and surface albedo. The impact of uncertainties in AOD and aerosol absorption on the estimates of aerosol DRE have been explored by perturbing the aerosol properties used in the radiative calculations. The current level of uncertainty in satellite AOD retrievals is found to contribute significant uncertainty to the aerosol DRE. However, the aerosol DRE is found to be less sensitive to uncertainties in aerosol absorption than in some other recent studies. Details of the approach will be presented, along with a discussion of results.",

In the fluid approach, photospheric magnetograms serve as observational input in semi-empirical coronal models that are used for estimating the plasma characteristics up to a heliocentric distance of 0.1AU. From there on a full MHD model which computes the three-dimensional time-dependent evolution of the macroscopic variables of the solar wind up to the orbit of the Earth is recruited. In the kinetic approach, an exospheric kinetic solar wind model based on the assumption of Maxwell and Kappa velocity distributions functions for protons and electrons respectively is used to determine appropriate boundary conditions to obtain the best comparison with available observations at the Earth's orbit. This will provide insight on more physically detailed processes, such as coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, that naturally arise by inclusion of suprathermal electrons in the model. We are interested in the profile of the solar wind speed and density at 1 AU, in characterising the slow and fast source regions of the wind and in comparing the features of that with results of exospheric models in similar conditions. We start from similar boundary conditions at the exobase and propagate the solution up to 1AU to compare MHD and kinetic treatments with observations.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica represent the largest ice-free area of the continent. The landscape is dominated by glaciers, exposed soils, streams, and ice-covered lakes, and hosts an incredible ecosystem that is largely driven by microbes and some invertebrates. Given the low air temperatures (-18C annual mean), little precipitation (<10 cm water equivalent/yr), and lack of vegetation cover, the Dry Valleys ecosystem is strongly influenced by physical processes. In the past two decades, summer conditions have been observed to fluctuate significantly. From 1986-2001, the area experienced a cooling trend and the ecosystem responded with decreasing soil invertebrate populations, decreased streamflow, decreased primary productivity in lakes, and decreased algal biomass in streams. Since 2001, 3 very high glacial melt years have occurred producing record stream flows and extensive wetted soils. During this most recent decade, the levels of closed-basin lakes have risen substantially, with increasing heat contents, and we have observed increased permafrost degradation along streambanks. Here we assess the ecosystem responses of the cooling 'press' that occurred from 1986-2001 and the more most recent decade that has had several strong pulses of energy driving the system to develop expectations for the future state and function of this polar desert ecosystem. We propose that the future trajectory of climate and energy input to the region will likely be more inconsistent than the cooling period was. Hence, the ecosystem will be consistently responding to pulses of change over varying time periods. We also expect that recovery of the ozone layer over Antarctica may play an important role in modifying both regional climate and the Dry Valleys ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "To improve dust emission schemes in large scale transport models, we developed the first physically-based model simulating the full erosion process in a turbulent flow by resolving explicitly saltating particle trajectories and dust suspension, in presence of vegetation. The large-eddy simulation technic is used here to simulate the turbulent flow, allowing to solve explicitly the main wind gusts near the surface and so the intermittency of the erosion process. The model appeared able to reproduce the saltation intermittency as visualized through the presence of blowing sand structures near the surface, known as aeolian streamers observed on beaches during windy days. In presence of vegetation, the model further allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of sand erosion to the arrangement and morphology of plants (shrubs versus trees). More recently, we further used the model to reanalyze the dependence of the size distribution of the dust flux to the wind speed for idealized erosion events starting from an air free of dust. We found that the suspension of small dust (around 1 μm) can be a long nonstationary process (several hours depending on the wind intensity) due to the low deposition velocity of this particle size range. This leads to a continuous enrichment of the near-surface dust flux in small particles, enrichment that is enhanced with wind intensity, independently of the possible role of saltators. The model also showed that the size distribution and magnitude of dust fluxes at a few meters height differ from those of the emitted flux at the surface as particles start to be sorted through the deposition process within the saltation layer. This last result should be considered when evaluating or calibrating “physically based” dust emission schemes against measured near-surface turbulent diffusive dust fluxes.",

            "abstract": "European air quality legislation has reduced emissions of air pollutants across Europe since the 1970s, resulting in improved air quality and benefits to human health but also an unintended impact on regional climate. Here we used a coupled chemistry-climate model and a new policy relevant emission scenario to determine the impact of air pollutant emission reductions over Europe. The emission scenario shows that a combination of technological improvements and end-of-pipe abatement measures in the energy, industrial and road transport sectors reduced European emissions of sulphur dioxide, black carbon and organic carbon by 53%, 59% and 32% respectively. We estimate that these emission reductions decreased European annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by 35%, sulphate by 44%, black carbon (BC) by 56% and particulate organic matter (POM) by 23%. The reduction in PM2.5 concentrations is calculated to have prevented 107,000 (40,000-172,000, 5-95% confidence intervals) premature deaths annually from cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer across the EU member states. The decrease in aerosol concentrations caused a positive all-sky aerosol radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere over Europe of 2.3±0.06 W m-2 and a positive clear-sky forcing of 1.7±0.05 W m-2. Additionally, the amount of solar radiation incident at the surface over Europe increased by 3.3±0.07 W m-2 under all-sky and by 2.7±0.05 W m-2 under clear-sky conditions. Reductions in BC concentrations caused a 1 Wm-2 reduction in atmospheric absorption. We use an energy budget approximation to show that the aerosol induced radiative changes caused both temperature and precipitation to increase globally and over Europe. Our results show that the implementation of European legislation to reduce the emission of air pollutants has improved air quality and human health over Europe, as well as altered the regional radiative balance and climate.",

            "abstract": "Here, GRACE K-band range rate (KBRR) observations are analyzed for the effects from small-scale hydrological signals over West Africa including water level changes in reservoirs, extreme weather events, and water storage variability predicted by hydrological models. The presented approach, which is based on level 1B data, avoids the downward continuation and filtering process required for computing monthly gravity field solutions and, thus, enables to assess hydrological signals with a high temporal resolution and at small spatial scales.\nIn a first step, water mass variations derived from tide gauges, altimetry, and from hydrological model output are converted into simulated KBRR observations. Secondly, these simulated observations and a number of geophysical corrections are reduced from the original GRACE K-band observations to obtain the residuals for a time span of ten years. Then, (i) the residuals are used to validate differently modeled water mass variations and (ii) extreme weather events are identified in the residuals.\nWest Africa represents an interesting study region as it is increasingly facing exteme precipitation events and floodings. In this study, monthly and daily output from different global hydrological models is validated for their representation of long-term and short-term (daily) water storage variability over West Africa. The daily RMS of KBRR residuals ranges between 0.1 μm/s and 0.7 μm/s. Smaller residuals imply that the model is able to better explain the observations. For example, we find that in 2007 the Land Surface Discharge Model (LSDM) better agrees with GRACE range-rate observations than the Water-GAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) and the GLDAS-Noah land surface model.\nFurthermore, we confirm previous studies and show that the signal from Lake Volta is distinctly contained in the residuals. Finally, we investigate variations of other smaller reservoirs and the floodings over West Africa in June 2009 and over Benin in October 2010.",

From the late Ordovician, the Yubei area developed distinctively NE-SW trending fold-and-thrust belts in rows which were eroded and deformed through multiphase tectonic movement (Dengfa He, 2007), with similarities and dissimilarities between each other rows in many aspects, at the Southern Tarim inner basin (Fig. 1). The northern of Hetian paleo-uplift and the northwestern of NE-trending folds zone on Caledonian in Tangguzibasi depression should be favorable to the potential exploration area for the first large-scale period of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation (Brown LF, 1979).\nIn this contribution, based on geophysical log, core and 2D/3D seismic data, we constructed its tectonic geometry morphology, controlled by detailed chronostratigraphic framework. According to the fault-related fold theory, rows of asymmetric fault-propagation folds grew in the Yubei area during the late Caledonian period, with the evidence of interpreted growth strata from the high resolution 3D seismic data (Suppe J et al., 1990). That intercontinental tecto-orogenic events from southern Tarim basin, leading to the transformation of its margins, affected inner basin at that time, modified the basin into the Tarim metacraton (Jean-Paul Liégeois, 2013; Zieglar P.A., 1998). Correlating the four tectonic groups of the identified with the axis variation of strata and fold amplitude distribution showed that fault evolution progressed in several superimposed stages: Precambrian, late Ordovician to early Carboniferous (Zhao Zongju, 2009), Carboniferous to Permian, Cenozoic. Analyzing the sedimentary development and structure evolution，the tectonic paleo-geographic setting is reconstructed, providing processes that govern the mechanism of this backbreak fold-and-thrust belts worldwide.\nMost importantly, detailed mapping of marker deflections in the hanging wall at top Ordovician in the Yubei area could help to constrain equivalent structures in the footwall, which may represent potential hydrocarbon traps.",

The AMPERE data products derived from the Iridium constellation provide global maps of magnetic field perturbations with an integration time of ten minutes. By dividing the maps into sectors, the response times at different magnetic local times and inside and outside the polar cap, can be compared. Forward regression is used to determine the past solar wind samples which best can explain the magnetic field perturbations. The main results are as follows. The full response near noon to the solar wind reconnection electric field occurs 10-20 minutes after the solar wind reaches the bow shock nose, and the midnight response is only 20 minutes later. An additional delayed response is usually observed after 60 to 90 minutes at the night side. No direct response to the reconnection electric field is seen closest to midnight inside the polar cap. As expected, the dayside response in the sunlit hemisphere is much stronger than in the dark hemisphere. But no difference in the response times between the hemispheres were found. The IMF BY exerts a strong influence on the direction of the magnetic field in the polar cap in the sunlit hemisphere. The response is within 20 minutes in all of the polar cap. In the dark hemisphere there is barely any response to IMF BY.",

            "abstract": "Reactions promoted by light are key in atmospheric chemistry. Some of them occur in the condensed phase of aerosols containing light absorbing organic compounds (George et al., 2015). This work explores the radical reactions initiated by near-UV light in mixtures of citric acid (CA) and imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC) using NO as a probe molecule for HO2, by means of coated wall flow tube experiments. Citric acid may act as H atom or electron donor in condensed phase radical cycles. IC may act as a photosensitizer. The loss of NO was measured by a chemiluminescence detector. The dependence of the NO loss on the NO concentration, the IC/CA ratio in the film, relative humidity, light intensity, oxygen molar fraction were investigated as well as the HONO and NO2 yields. We also added halide salts to investigate the effect of a competing electron donor in the system and the output of halogens to the gas phase. We found a correlation between the loss of NO above the film and the molar ratio of IC/CA and the light intensity. The variation of the NO loss with oxygen corroborates a mechanism, in which the triplet excited state of IC is reduced by citric acid, to a reduced ketyl radical that transfers an electron to molecular oxygen, which in turn leads to production of HO2 radicals. Therefore, the NO loss in the gas phase is related to the production of HO2 radicals. Relative humidity had a strong impact on the HO2 output, which shows a maximum production rate at around 30%. The addition of halide ions (X- = Cl-, Br-, I-) increases the HO2 output at low concentration and decrease it at higher concentration when X2- radical ions likely scavenge HO2. We could preliminarily quantify for the first time the contribution of these processes to the oxidative capacity in the atmosphere and conclude that their role is significant for aerosol aging and potentially a significant source of halogen compounds to the gas phase.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic systems are complex, containing many sources, feedbacks, and interfaces, as well as heterogeneities and transience that increase the difficulty associated with simulating age or reconstructing tracer concentrations. Investigation of the system’s components in isolation ignores these feedbacks, which may have a profound impact on the simulated result. This presentation demonstrates how high-resolution, integrated hydrologic models can be combined with Lagrangian particle tracking to provide an unprecedented accounting of the particles’ history over time. The time spent in each process domain (groundwater, vadose zone, and surface water) is delineated, which permits the changes in tracer concentrations to be simulated differently in each domain. The example application uses geologically based characterizations (deterministic and geostatistical) and high performance computing to investigate changes in the distribution of age under different potential recharge scenarios for a high-alpine watershed in Colorado. The vadose zone played the most important role in this example and the saturated groundwater system exhibited minimal changes for the different recharge cases. Tracers that remain in equilibrium with the atmosphere throughout the vadose zone would not capture these effects, despite the large shifts in total residence time.\nThe approach is not limited to steady-state systems and is easily adapted for transient flow fields. The main limitations to these methods are the structural and parametric uncertainty of the flow and transport models, the heavy data requirements, and the difficulty in calibrating transient integrated models. However, the main strength of these methods is for making relative comparisons based on qualitatively validated flow models. In this context, the tools presented here provide a dynamic, virtual hypothesis-testing laboratory for investigating change in complex hydrologic systems.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland ice sheet (GIS) accounts for ~ 70% of global ice sheet mass loss and contributes to sea level rise at a rate of 0.7 mm/yr. Therefore, the GIS needs to be carefully monitored. The spaceborne techniques commonly used to monitor the GIS mass balance contain inherent uncertainties. These uncertainties can be reduced by comparing independent datasets and techniques. However, spaceborne methods remain inadequate in the sense that they offer low spatial and/or temporal resolution. This fact highlights the need for other complimentary methods to monitor the GIS more accurately and with greater resolution. Here we use a seismic method: the correlation of seismic noise recorded at South-West Greenland seismic stations to show that the GIS seasonal melt produces significant variations of seismic wave speed in the Greenland crust. The amplitudes of the measured velocity variations during 2012-2013 correlate with the total ice plus atmospheric mass variations measured by the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission. We explain the phase delay between mass maxima and velocity minima ( 50 days) using a non-linear poroelastic model that includes a 55 cm-thick layer of till between the ice sheet and the bedrock. We, thus, interpret the velocity variations as pore pressure variations in the bedrock resulting from the loading and unloading of the overlying glacier and atmosphere. This method provides a new and independent way to monitor in near real-time the first-order state of the GIS, giving new constraints on its evolution and its contribution to the global sea level rise. By increasing the density of seismic stations in the region it will be possible to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the method and create detailed maps of ice-mass variations across Greenland.",

            "abstract": "A tephrostratigraphic record covering the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 1-15 was established for the DEEP site record of Lake Ohrid (Macedonia/Albania). Major element analyses (SEM-EDS/WDS) were carried out on juvenile fragments extracted from 12 tephra layers and one cryptotephra (OH-DP-0027 to OH-DP-2060). The geochemical analyses of all of these layers suggest an origin from the Italian Volcanic Provinces, including: the Mercato tephra (8.530 ± 0.1 cal a BP) of Somma-Vesuvius, the Y-3 (29.05 ± 0.37 ka cal BP), the Y‑5/Campanian Ignimbrite (39.6 ± 0.1 ka), and the X-6 (109 ± 2 ka) of the Campi Flegrei, the P11 of the Pantelleria Island (129 ± 6 ka), the Vico B (162 ± 6 ka) of the Vico volcano, the Pozzolane Rosse (457 ± 2 ka) and the Tufo di Bagni Albule (527 ±2 ka) of the Colli Albani volcanic district, and the Fall A (496 ± 3 ka, here discussed) of the Sabatini volcanic field. Furthermore, a comparison of the Ohrid record with the tephrostratigraphic records of mid-distal archives allowed the recognition of the equivalents of other less known tephra, such as the TM24-a/POP2 (101.8 ka BP) from Lago Grande di Monticchio and the Sulmona basin, the CF-V5/PRAD3225 (~ 162 ka) from the Campo Felice basin and the Adriatic Sea, the SC5 (494 ± 11 ka) from the Mercure basin, and the A11/12 (511 ± 6 ka) from the Acerno basin, whose specific volcanic origins are still poorly defined. For the first time, the Middle Pleistocene tephrostratigraphic framework of Italian volcanoes could be extended beyond Italy to the Balkan Region. The establishment of the tephrostratigraphic framework for the Lake Ohrid record provides important, independent tie-points for the age-depth model of the DEEP site sequence, which is a prerequisite for paleoclimatic and -environmental reconstructions. Furthermore, this age-depth model helps to improve and re-evaluate the chronology of both unknown and dated tephra layers. Thus, the Lake Ohrid record is candidate to become the Rosetta stone for the central and eastern Mediterranean tephrostratigraphy, especially for the hitherto poorly known and explored Middle Pleistocene period.",

            "abstract": "The Laptev Sea Rift in the northeastern Arctic shelf area of Russia is a standard example for an oceanic rift system that propagates into a continent and plays an important role in the geodynamic models for the opening of the Eurasia Basin. To better understand the evolution of this rift, a basin modelling study was carried out with the software PetroMod®. The software simulates and analyses the burial history and temperature evolution of a sedimentary basin. It is a dynamic forward simulation based on the finite element method. The modelled section used in this study is based on a depth converted seismic section, acquired by the BGR. The section covers the Anisin Basin and is characterized by listric normal faults. The numerical simulation was supported by tectonic and sedimentological field data sets that were collected in outcrops during the CASE 13 expedition in 2011. Normal faults in outcrops were analysed using fault-slip inversion techniques to derive the paleo-extension direction. The presence of normal faults in relatively unconsolidated Paleogene sediments and in Neogene to Quaternary volcanic rocks, indicate very young extension in the area of the New Siberian Islands. The conceptual model for the simulation was built on the basis of the seismic data and the properties of the rocks and sediments observed in the outcrops. Initial results show that the present-day temperature field in the area of the Anisin Basin is characterized by seafloor-parallel isotherms. In the central part of the graben structure, the isotherms are slightly bent down and the heat-flow is reduced, probably due to blanketing effects. An extracted geohistory curve is almost linear and implies that subsidence controlled by faults is the dominating mechanism. From the simulation, sedimentation rates are derived that were highest in the early Paleocene phase of graben development and decreased in the late Eocene.",

            "abstract": "The stratigraphic architecture of turbidite and other systems dominated by gravity flows is underpinned by the ability to transport sediment as suspended load. The ability to transport sediment is crucial to concepts of flow efficiency and equilibrium profile. Predominately bypass-erosional flows transport their sediment load downslope to the basin; forming sand-starved slope channels and canyons. In contrast, flows that cannot suspend their sediment are depositional on inbound slopes leading to constructional slope systems with sand-filled slope conduits and potentially sand starved basins.\nAn experimentally validated mathematical model for polydisperse turbulent suspension is used to estimate the critical shear velocity (u*c) for the threshold between depositional and erosional regimes in gravity driven flows. The model shows that the criterion is a function of flow concentration and grain-size distribution increasing as stratification increases within flows: arising from either higher particle concentrations or maximum sizes (increased mean, standard deviation and decreased skew). Predicted values of u*c are as much as two orders of magnitude greater than those derived using standard monodisperse sediment transport models (e.g., Rouse criterion). The results presented better constrain the potential for total sediment bypass on slopes in turbidite systems. Representative values of velocity and density from monitored natural sandy turbidity currents show total sediment bypass or erosion may be typical in the head and body of supercritical flows on average canyon slopes.",

            "abstract": "Human activities have impacted aquatic systems through the release of contaminants and the regulation of surface and groundwater. Although environmental monitoring has been essential in detecting eutrophication, biodiversity loss or water quality deterioration, monitoring activities are limited in time and are thus not sufficient in their scope to identify causality and thresholds. Paleolimnological studies increasingly show that the response of lakes to climatic and human influences is complex, multidimensional, and often indirectly mediated through watershed processes. In this study we examine the history of eutrophication processes in small lakes in Estonia using the multi-proxy analysis of sediment.\nStudy sites represent lakes with different anthropogenic stressors: urbanisation and recreational use, run-off from an oil shale mine, and fish-kills and liming measures. We have used diverse analytical methods, such as elemental analysis, stable isotopes, fossil pigments, diatoms and Cladocera remains. The information derived from sedimentary indicators broadly agrees with the historical evidence of eutrophication and pollution. Moreover, the sediment records are indispensable for identifying additional issues such as: 1) earlier onset of cultural eutrophication; 2) the significant impact of catchment erosion on the deterioration of lake quality, particularly cyanobacterial blooms; and 3) changes in sedimentation processes with significance for internal biogeochemical cycling of nutrients. Importantly, the integration of several methods has significantly improved interpretation of sedimentary data and elucidated the different strengths of various indicator types. The project findings prove to be highly relevant for both the prediction of the ecological responses of lakes to different anthropogenic impacts and the establishment of reasonable reference target conditions in restoration schemes, as well as for methodological improvements of the sediment analysis.",

            "abstract": "Vertical plant profiles are important descriptors of canopy structure and are used to inform models of biomass, biodiversity and fire risk. In Australia, an approach has been developed to produce large area maps of vertical plant profiles by extrapolating waveform lidar estimates of vertical plant profiles from ICESat/GLAS using large area segmentation of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat satellite image products. The main assumption of this approach is that the vegetation height profiles are consistent across the segments defined from ALOS PALSAR and Landsat image products.\nMore than 1500 field sites were used to develop an index of fractional cover using Landsat data. A time series of the green fraction was used to calculate the persistent green fraction continuously across the landscape. This was fused with ALOS PALSAR L-band Fine Beam Dual polarisation 25m data and used to segment the Australian landscapes. K-means clustering then grouped the segments with similar cover and backscatter into approximately 1000 clusters. Where GLAS-ICESat footprints intersected these clusters, canopy profiles were extracted and aggregated to produce a mean vertical vegetation profile for each cluster that was used to derive mean canopy and understorey height, depth and density. Due to the large number of returns, these retrievals are near continuous across the landscape, enabling them to be used for inventory and modelling applications.\nTo validate this product, a radiative transfer model was adapted to map directional gap probability from airborne waveform lidar datasets to retrieve vertical plant profiles Comparison over several test sites show excellent agreement and work is underway to extend the analysis to improve national biomass mapping. The integration of the three datasets provide options for future operational monitoring of structure and AGB across large areas for quantifying carbon dynamics, structural change and biodiversity.",

We present a discrete, pore-scale model that captures the spatiotemporal nonlocality associated with the rapid interface advancement and consequent readjustments and screening effects, and the disparate timescales of pore filling and bulk flow. Our simulations capture the transition between three invasion regimes: (i) viscous fingering with thin fingers and highly-irregular interfaces at high injection rates; (ii) capillary fingering with multiple trapped clusters in slow drainage (low contact angle θ); and (iii) stable, compact front in slow imbibition (high θ), despite a large, unfavorable viscosity ratio, in agreement with experiments. We show that increasing the wettability of the invading fluid (the contact angle) promotes cooperative pore filling that stabilizes the invasion, and that this effect is suppressed as the flow rate increases due to viscous instabilities. Stability increases in samples with lower disorder and porosity. We use scaling analysis to derive two dimensionless numbers that predict the mode of displacement.",

            "abstract": "The ~50 million year transition from the peak in reversal frequency in the Middle Jurassic (~170Ma), associated with a weak geomagnetic field, to the stable and apparently strong field during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (84-121Ma), represents a dramatic change in time-averaged geomagnetic field behaviour during the Mesozoic Era. New evidence from Siberian samples suggests there is a similar transition in geomagnetic field behaviour during the Palaeozoic, with a weak geomagnetic field in the Upper Devonian preceding the Permo-Carboniferous Superchron (262-318Ma). Both sites, the Viluy Traps and the Zharovsk complex of the Patom Margin, have seemingly reliable, published palaeomagnetic directions and new age constraints, 364.4 ± 1.7Ma (40Ar/39A) 371-377Ma (U-Pb) respectively. The samples were measured using the Thermal Thellier-Coe protocol with partial thermo-remanent magnetisation (pTRM) and tail checks and the Microwave Thellier-IZZI protocol with pTRM checks. Accepted Arai plots show positive pTRM checks, a clear relation between distinct primary directional and palaeointensity components and little to no zig-zagging. Three distinct magneto-mineralogical types were identified from SEM and rock magnetic techniques; low Ti- and intermediate Ti- titanomagnetite and possible maghemite, with mineral type affecting the success rate of samples but resulting in no significant variation in palaeointensity results. The Arai plots also commonly have a distinct two-slope concave-up shape, although non-heating, pseudo-Thellier experiments have supported this resulting from a strong overprint component rather than alteration or multi-domain effects. Results from these experiments give low site mean values between 2.3-29.9μT (Virtual Dipole Moments 4-50.6 ZAm2). The apparently periodic (~180 million years) transitions in geomagnetic field behaviour may indicate the influence of mantle convection changing heat flow across the Core Mantle Boundary.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological models are important tools to support decision making in water resource management in the past few decades. Nowadays, frequent occurrence of extreme hydrological events has put focus on development of real-time hydrological modeling and forecasting systems. Among the various types of hydrological models, it is only the rainfall-runoff models for surface water that are commonly used in the online real-time fashion; and there is never a tradition to use integrated hydrological models for both surface water and groundwater with large scale perspective. At the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), we have setup and calibrated an integrated hydrological model that covers the entire nation, namely the DK-model. So far, the DK-model has only been used in offline mode for historical and future scenario simulations. Therefore, challenges arise when operating the DK-model in real-time mode due to lack of technical experiences and stakeholder awareness. In the present study, we try to demonstrate the process of bringing the DK-model online while actively involving the opinions of the stakeholders. Although the system is not yet fully operational, a prototype has been finished and presented to the stakeholders which can simulate groundwater levels, streamflow and water content in the root zone with a lead time of 48 hours and refreshed every 6 hours. The active involvement of stakeholders has provided very valuable insights and feedbacks for future improvements.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic displays a number of major modes of decadal variability, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). On decadal to multi-decadal timescales, this unforced climate variability is expected to be more influential on the overall pattern of climate than anthropogenic forcing. Greater understanding of this decadal-scale variability is essential to improve its predictability, which in turn is vital to constrain uncertainty in decadal to centennial climate change predictions.\nNumerous studies have investigated how oceanic and atmospheric forcing modulates climate variability. However the feedbacks between the land surface and decadal variability have not been examined to the same degree. The land surface influences climate via biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes which interact and vary across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Increasing concentrations of CO2 are expected to drive a change in the distribution and physiology (i.e. stomatal conductance and leaf area index) of vegetation, which can alter land surface structure and influence biogeophysical processes. It is important to more accurately constrain if/how land surface cover influences decadal variability and the associated feedback mechanisms and how these may change in a warming climate.\nThis sensitivity study will use the HadCM3 climate model to investigate the impact of a range of vegetation distributions on the strength and variability of the AMOC/NAO at increasing CO2 concentrations. We aim to elucidate feedbacks between the land surface, ocean and atmosphere in a coupled climate model and potential implications for decadal modelling studies.",

            "abstract": "The Solar Wind Earth Exchange Project (SWEEP) seeks to improve our understanding of the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth. X-ray emission resulting from charge exchange between oxygen in the solar wind and magnetospheric neutral hydrogen is modelled for a series of observations from XMM-Newton, an X-ray astronomical observatory. We use OMNI solar wind conditions, heavy ion composition data from ACE, the Hodges neutral hydrogen model and combine these with the GUMICS-4 MHD model to predict the global levels of X-ray emission from solar wind charge exchange (in the 0.5-0.7 keV band). The emission is then integrated along a line of sight and compared to the measured XMM-Newton sky background emissivity rates to determine the accuracy of these model predictions. Our results show that the magnitude of the integrated X-ray emissivity for both the modelled and observed flux is similar in a large number of cases, while the correlation of emission changes in detail between cases. We show that the accuracy of the oxygen density and relative charge state abundances is vital. The positional accuracy of the magnetopause is important as it forms the outer edge of the masking of the plasmasphere, including the cusps in our global emissivity rates. The derived position of the magnetopause and various masks are discussed with examples given, highlighting their relative accuracy. We also show the potential of X-ray emission for remote sensing of the magnetosphere, when used in combination with a wide field X-ray imaging system.",

As nutrient deficient ecosystems, it’s critical to examine the nutrient availabilities and seasonal dynamics. We used Plant Root Simulators (PRSTM) at Mer Bleue bog to provide some baseline data on nutrient availability and its variability. In particular, we focused on ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and potassium, iron, sulphate and aluminum. We placed PRS probes at a depth of 5 – 15 cm in pristine plots and plots with long term N, P and K fertilization for 4 weeks and determined the availability of these nutrients, from spring through to fall. Probes were also placed beneath the water table in hummock and hollow microtopography and along a transect including part of the bog which had been drained through the creation of a ditch 80 years ago. The result showed that there was limited available ammonium, nitrate and phosphate in the bog, the seasonal variation of nutrient availabilities probably due to mineralization, an increase in the availability of some nutrients between different water table depths or as a result of drainage, and the relative availability of nutrients compared to the input from fertilization. We suggest that PRS probes could be a useful tool to examine nutrient availability and dynamics in wetlands, with careful consideration of installing condition, for example, proper exposure period, depth relative to water table etc.",

Challenges to creating such a database include assessing data continuity between multiple satellite missions and SO2 retrieval algorithms and estimating measurement uncertainties. Here, we describe the approaches that we are using to merge multi-decadal SO2 measurements from the ultraviolet (UV) Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Ozone Monitoring and Profiler Suite (OMPS) sensors. A particular challenge has involved accounting for the OMI row anomaly (ORA), a data gap in OMI measurements since 2008 that partially or wholly obscures some volcanic eruption clouds, whilst still profiting from the high OMI spatial resolution and data quality, and prior OMI SO2 validation. We present a new method to substitute missing SO2 information in the ORA with near-coincident SO2 data from OMPS, providing improved estimates of eruptive volcanic SO2 emissions. The technique can also be used to assess consistency between different satellite instruments and SO2 retrieval algorithms, investigate the impact of variable sensor spatial resolution, and estimate measurement uncertainties. It is particularly effective for larger eruptions producing extensive SO2 clouds where the ORA obscures the volcanic plume in multiple contiguous orbits. Application of the technique is demonstrated using recent volcanic eruptions including the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile. We also provide an update on the status of the multi-satellite long-term volcanic SO2 database (MSVOLSO2L4).",

However, LES modelling is not without its own limitations – most notably, the need to parameterise the effects of all subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence. Here, we employ a stochastic backscatter SGS model, which explicitly handles the effects of both forward and reverse energy transfer to/from the subgrid scales, to simulate the neutrally stratified ABL as well as flow within an idealised urban street canyon. In both cases, a clear improvement in LES output statistics is observed when compared with the performance of a SGS model that handles forward energy transfer only. In the neutral ABL case, the near-surface velocity profile is brought significantly closer towards its expected logarithmic form. In the street canyon case, the strength of the primary vortex that forms within the canyon is more accurately reproduced when compared to wind tunnel measurements. Our results indicate that grid-scale backscatter plays an important role in both these modelled situations.",

I will also show how we use such techniques on simulation models themselves to identify key sources of variation in their predictions: helping to pinpoint important focal areas for model improvement.

Only recently fire models have been developed that are able to represent the important role of fire for vegetation dynamics and land carbon cycling at global scale. Here, we investigate how fire is represented in Earth System Models (ESMs) that participated in the 5th Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and present more recent advances in global fire modeling for upcoming CMIPs.\nBurned area and carbon emissions from fire are among the variables reported in CMIP5. ESMs from CMIP5 use common simulation and output protocols, enabling direct comparisons between models. For this study ESMs were selected from the CMIP5 repository based on the availability of burned area and/or carbon emissions from fires for the historical and the rcp2.6/4.5/8.5 simulations. All ESMs analyzed show a comparable global total burned area of about 150 to 200 Mha burned per year for the present day period, which is lower than satellite based observations (e.g. GFEDv3 ~370 Mha/year). Most models show over the historical period (1850 – 2005) only a weak change in global fire activity and for the future (2006 – 2100) strong increases in fire activity for rcp4.5 and rcp8.5, but only moderate changes for the rcp2.6 projection. Regionally the response differs strongly between the models, which is partly related to different climate projections. We further analysed the simulated changes in fire activity with respect to simulated changes in temperature and precipitation from which no general pattern of the sensitivity of fire carbon emissions towards changes in climate emerged.

            "abstract": "Any detection of ultra-relativistic electrons (>10 MeV) trapped in the inner magnetosphere is potentially a sensitive indicator of a unique particle acceleration process or of a unique particle source. The 24 March 1991 shock injection of >15 MeV electrons is a classic example of the former, while the latter includes measurements in low Earth orbit of >100 MeV electrons and positrons from cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere.\nIn this paper we use new instrumentation on the Van Allen Probes to survey the inner magnetosphere for signatures of ultra-relativistic electrons. The Relativistic Proton Spectrometer, designed primarily for spectroscopy of 60 to 2000 MeV protons in the inner belt, nonetheless is capable of detecting minimum-ionizing electrons in a silicon detector stack. More critical to this survey is the instrument's Cherenkov radiator subsystem whose response to incident electrons ranges from a threshold near 10 MeV and reaches light saturation above 50 MeV. Together with the silicon detector system we are able to explore an energy range that has not been routinely studied in the context of the Earth's magnetosphere.\nWe will report on quiet-time and storm-time signatures in regions of the inner magnetosphere that heretofore have not been explored with an orbit like that of Van Allen Probes. We will also quantitatively compare our electron energy spectra, or flux limits, with other measurements from Van Allen Probes and prior glimpses of high-energy electrons from low Earth orbit.",

            "abstract": "Tight sandstones have a low porosity and a very small permeability K. Available models for K do not compare well with measurements. These sandstones are made of SiO_2 grains, with a typical size of several hundreds of micron. These grains are separated by a network of micro-cracks, with sizes ranging between microns down to tens of nm. Therefore, the structure can be schematized by Voronoi polyhedra separated by plane and permeable polygonal micro-cracks.\nOur goal is to estimate K based on a two scale analysis and to compare the results to measurements.\nFor a particular sample [2], local measurements on several scales include FIB/SEM [3], CMT and 2D SEM. FIB/SEM is selected because the peak pore size given by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry is of 350nm. FIB/SEM imaging (with 50 nm voxel size) identifies an individual crack of 180nm average opening, whereas CMT provides a connected porosity (individual crack) for 60 nm voxel size, of 4 micron average opening.\nNumerical modelling is performed by combining the micro-crack network scale (given by 2D SEM) and the 3D micro-crack scale (given by either FIB/SEM or CMT). Estimates of the micro-crack density are derived from 2D SEM trace maps by counting the intersections with scanlines, the surface density of traces, and the number of fracture intersections. K is deduced by using a semi empirical formula valid for identical, isotropic and uniformly distributed fractures [1]. This value is proportional to the micro-crack transmissivity sigma.\nSigma is determined by solving the Stokes equation in the micro-cracks measured by FIB/SEM or CMT.\nK is obtained by combining the two previous results. Good correlation with measured values on centimetric plugs is found when using sigma from CMT data. The results are discussed and further research is proposed.\n[1] Adler et al, Fractured porous media, Oxford Univ. Press, 2012.\n[2] Duan et al, Int. J. Rock Mech.

            "abstract": "On 16 December, 2013, an earthquake of Ms5.1 occurred in Badong County, the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. We collected all the 150 published focal mechanism solutions (FMS) and inversed the tectonic stress field in Badong, the Three Gorges Dam and Huangling anticline area using the software SATSI (Hardebeck and Michael, 2006). Inversion results show that the orientations of maximum principle stress axis (σ1) in Badong plunge to NNE or SSW. Detailed characteristics of the stress field indicate that the σ1 axis is almost vertical in the center of Huangling anticline and turns horizontal to the west. As to deep structures, we studied the satellite gravity anomalies of 8-638 order in this area using the EIGEN-6C2 model provided by ICGRM. Combining the seismic sounding profile through the epicenter of Badong earthquake and the petrology data, we reinterpreted the deep structure in the study area. The results show that the deep crust in Badong is unstable and the deep material’s upwelling leads to Huangling anticline continued uplifting, which is consistent with the result indicated from the stress filed. Both of them provide energy for the preparation of earthquake. The FMS shows that Gaoqiao Fault is the causative fault of this Ms5.1 earthquake. Field investigations indicated that the lithology and fracture characteristic in Badong is beneficial to reservoir water infiltration. Before the earthquake, reservoir water level raised to 175m, the highest storage level, which increased the loading. Based on above researches, we believe that the Ms5.1 Badong earthquake is controlled by deep tectonic environment and stress field in shallow crust. The reservoir water infiltration and uploading increase generated by water storage of the Three Gorges area reduced the strength of Gaoqiao Fault and changed its stress state. These factors jointly promoted an abrupt movement of the fault in the critical stress state, and triggered the Ms5.1 Badong earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Measurements at high-Arctic sites show a strong seasonal cycle in aerosol number and size. The number of aerosols with diameters larger than 20 nm exhibits a maximum in late spring associated with a dominant accumulation mode, and a second maximum in the summer associated with a dominant Aitken mode. Seasonal-mean aerosol effective diameter ranges from about 160 nm in summer to 250 nm in winter. This study interprets these seasonal cycles with the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global aerosol microphysics model. We find improved agreement with in situ measurements (SMPS) of aerosol size at both Alert, Nunavut, and Mt. Zeppelin, Svalbard following model developments: 1) increase the efficiency of wet scavenging in the Arctic summer and 2) represent coagulation between interstitial aerosols and aerosols activated to form cloud droplets. Our simulations indicate that the dominant summer-time Aitken mode is associated with increased efficiency of wet removal, which limits the number of larger aerosols and promotes local new-aerosol formation. We also find an important role of interstitial coagulation in clouds in the Arctic, which limits the number of Aitken-mode aerosols in the non-summer seasons when direct wet removal of these aerosols is inefficient.\nThe summertime Arctic atmosphere is particularly pristine and strongly influenced by natural regional emissions which have poorly understood climate impacts. Especially influenced are the climatic roles of atmospheric particles and clouds. Here we present evidence that ammonia (NH3) emissions from migratory-seabird guano (dung) are the primary contributor to summertime free ammonia levels recently measured in the Canadian Arctic atmosphere. These findings suggest that ammonia from seabird guano is a key factor contributing to bursts of new-particle formation, which are observed every summer in the near-surface atmosphere at Alert, Canada. Chemical transport model simulations show that these newly formed particles can grow by vapour condensation to diameters sufficiently large to influence Arctic cloud properties and lead to a pan-Arctic cooling over -0.1 W m-2 with local cooling exceeding -1 W m-2 near some bird colonies. These coupled ecological-chemical processes may be susceptible to Arctic warming and industrialization.",

            "abstract": "While there is consensus about a future decrease in carbonaceous aerosol emissions from anthropogenic sources, the future trend in aerosol emissions from wildﬁres is much more uncertain. Previous studies indicated that global warming could significantly increase wildfire activity in the 21st century, but the complex links between future changes in emission fluxes, emission heights and aerosol long-range transport remain to be quantified.\nIn this study, we use the process-based ﬁre model SPITFIRE within the global vegetation model JSBACH to simulate wildﬁre activity for present day climate conditions and different future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Simulated ﬁre emissions serve as input for the aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2, which has been extended by a semi-empirical plume height parametrization.\nIn our presentation, we will show that, compared to present day climate conditions, the modelled changes in emission ﬂuxes for the period 2090-2099 are most pronounced for the strongest warming scenario RCP8.5 (-37 % in the tropics, +49 % in the extra-tropics). Tropospheric Black Carbon (BC) concentrations are similarly aﬀected by changes in emission ﬂuxes and changes in climate conditions with regional relative variations of -50 % to +100 %. In the vicinity of the major extra-tropical biomass burning regions the enhanced wildfire emission fluxes in turn introduce a distinct increase in Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT). Due to the compensating effects of fire intensification and more stable atmospheric conditions, simulated future changes in mean emission heights do not exceed 0.3 km.\nOverall, we conclude that the radiative impact of the expected future increase in wildfire activity is of a similar magnitude like the opposed radiative impact introduced by a decrease in anthropogenic BC emissions. Changes in emission heights, however, are of minor importance.",

With this study we aim at providing valuable data between periods of 300s and 1200s, corresponding to long-period surface waves and the first normal mode of the free oscillation of the Earth, respectively. We assess the performance of each dataset at the light of comparisons with synthetic seismic displacement waveforms. We find that GPS is well capable of recovering millimetre ground motion oscillations in a wide range of periods (30 - 1300 s), potentially providing valuable information on the lithosphere and upper-mantle heterogeneities on a scale of 300 - 3000 km.\nWith the aim of building a database of GPS waveforms we have conducted a study of different processing techniques with the GAMIT and Bernese GPS data processing packages. We show the outline of the planned GPS waveform database, which consists of long period surface wave records of large earthquakes (Mw > 7) of the last decades, and could be used for various seismological applications.",

            "abstract": "Soil as source of ecosystem services is a major component of climate resilience. Two of the critical ecosystem services derived from soil are water and nutrient cycling. High quality soils improve the capacity to absorb and retain precipitation leading to enhanced water availability to plants which increases climate resilience. The trend towards increasing variability in precipitation requires that the soil be capable of maintaining infiltration rates under extreme precipitation events. Climate resilience will occur when crop productivity is stabilized under more variable climate regimes and dependent upon having adequate soil water supplies to each crop. There is a direct relationship between soil quality and crop productivity and as the soil resource is degraded there is a greater gap between attainable and actual productivity of crop. As the soil is improved there is enhanced nutrient cycling which in turn increases nutrient availability to the crop and food security. Soil becomes the foundation of sustainable ecosystems and enhancing the quality of soil will have a benefit to food and water resources. Improving the soil will benefit humankind through multiple impacts on water, food, and ecosystems.",

Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), a large area can be efficiently covered at high spatial resolution to quantify regional topography. Structure from Motion applied to photogrammetric techniques from a UAV has proven to be a successful tool, but challenges to UAV-based SfM include high-altitude locations with few distinctive surface features and minor textural differences.\nIn June 2015, we piloted a small UAV (Quest) in order to conduct a topographical survey of Summit Camp, Greenland using SfM. Summit Camp sits at a surface elevation of 3200 meters above sea level, and occupies a snow-covered surface. The flat, very uniform terrain proved to be a challenge when flying the UAV and processing imagery using SfM techniques. In this presentation we discuss the issues both with operating a UAV instrument platform at high-altitude in the polar regions and interpreting the resulting DEM from a snow-covered region.\nThe final DEM of Summit Camp covers a large portion of the surface area directly impacted by camp activities. In particular, volume calculations of drifting snow gauge an estimate of the equipment hours that will be required to clear and unearth structures. Investigation of surface roughness at multiple length scales can similarly provide insight on the accuracy of the DEM when observing texturally uniform surfaces.",

More than 1,000 SRs have been identified on martian surface and most of them are considered as inverted stream valleys or eskers in origin. Our study region, Solis Planum, is a large lava plain located in the southeast of the Tharsis region and formed mainly in Hesperian. We identified 47 SRs in Solis Planum for the first time and analyzed their morphology, thermophysical properties and relative ages in detail using CTX, HiRISE, HRSC and THEMIS data. Our results show that the SRs have multiple cross-section types and different thermophysical properties, and most SRs formed in late Hesperian. We also found some distinctive morphologic features associated with the SRs such as lineation, depressions and lobate features. Based on these observations, we proposed that the origin of these SRs is related to lava tubes, which is different from most of the SRs investigated in previous studies. Besides, SRs in Solis Planum could be feeding tunnels for the relatively young lavas on the plain far away from Tharsis Montes.",

            "abstract": "The radionuclide retention of redox sensitive radionuclides (e.g. Pu, Np, U, Tc) in crystalline host rock greatly depends on the rock matrix and the rock redox capacity. Preservation of drill cores concerning oxidation is therefore of paramount importance to reliably predict the near-natural radionuclide retention properties. Here, experimental results of HTO and Tc laboratory migration experiments in a naturally single fractured Äspö un-oxidized drill core are modelled using two different 2D models. Both models employ geometrical information obtained by µ-computed tomography (µCT) scanning of the drill core. The models differ in geometrical complexity meaning the first model (PPM-MD) consists of a simple parallel plate with a porous matrix adjacent to the fracture whereas the second model (MPM) uses the mid-plane of the 3D fracture only (no porous matrix). Simulation results show that for higher flow rates (Peclet number > 1), the MPM satisfactorily describes the HTO breakthrough curves (BTC) whereas the PPM-MD model nicely reproduces the HTO BTC for small Pe numbers (<1). These findings clearly highlight the influence of fracture geometry/flow field complexity on solute transport for Pe numbers > 1 and the dominating effect of matrix diffusion for Peclet numbers < 1. Retention of Tc is modelled using a simple Kd-approach in case of the PPM-MD and including 1st order sorptive reduction/desorption kinetics in case of the MPM. Batch determined sorptive reduction/desorption kinetic rates and Kd values for Tc on non-oxidized Äspö diorite are used in the model and compared to best fit values. By this approach, the transferability of kinetic data concerning sorptive reduction determined in static batch experiments to dynamic transport experiments is examined.",

            "abstract": "Ascension Island (8oS, 14 oW) is a South Atlantic background site for atmospheric measurement. Royal Holloway, in collaboration with the UK Met Office, installed a Picarro 1301 CRDS in 2010 for continuous methane monitoring. This has high precision and accuracy, with a 6-gas calibration and target suite, to measure long term methane mole fraction. Regular flask sampling is also carried out for NOAA and RHUL (co-located), to measure δ13CCH4 isotopic trends.\nAscension Island experiences near-constant SE Trade winds below the Trade Wind Inversion (TWI), with air from the remote S. Atlantic. In flask samples and in continuous monitoring at the Airhead location, atmospheric methane mole fraction has been increasing since 2007 whilst the δ13CCH4 isotope record has shifted to more depleted values. Above the normally well-defined TWI (1200 - 1800m altitude), variable tropical air masses pass over Ascension. This air last mixed with the boundary layer over Africa or South America.\nField work undertaken in September 2014 and July 2015, in collaboration with U. Bristol and U. Birmingham, using UAVs (octocopters) collected samples with Tedlar bags or aluminium flasks from different heights above and below the TWI. The maximum altitude reached was 2700masl. Sample bags were immediately analysed on Ascension for CH4 mole fraction using the Picarro CRDS and subsequently analysed at RHUL for δ13CCH4 using continuous-flow gas chromatography/isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (CF-GC/IRMS). The TWI was clearly identified by an increase in CH4 mole fraction above the TWI. Back trajectory analysis was used to distinguish the origins of the air masses, with air above showing inputs from the land surfaces of equatorial and southern Africa, and from southern S. America.\nThe campaigns have extended the envelope of altitudes accessed by micro-UAVs for atmospheric science, demonstrating their utility for probing the remote free troposphere and for penetrating the TWI. Sampling at Ascension is able to measure both the deep S. Atlantic air and also the air that has been mixed by convective systems in the equatorial and southern savannah tropics. Biomass burning plumes in southern hemisphere winter may also be accessible. Ascension is thus potentially a measurement site of global significance.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of solar wind fluctuations have focused research on how the turbulent energy is dissipated and ultimately converted to heat. To reveal the physical mechanism of the dissipation process in solar wind turbulence, we develop a model which describes magnetic energy spectra at electron scales. Our model combines the energy transport process from large to small scales and collisionless damping processes, which extract energy from the magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic regime. We assume wave-particle interactions to be the main damping process. The damping is described through the imaginary part of the kinetic Alfvén wave frequency, which we obtain from linear Vlasov theory.\nWe show that damping by kinetic Alfvén waves can explain the spectral shape in the dissipation range and might be the dominant dissipation process at least for the given plasma conditions. The dissipation model reveals the independence of the dissipation scale from the energy cascade rate for small plasma beta, which is a remarkable difference to hydrodynamic turbulence. A statistical study of modeled energy spectra confirms this result by showing a high corrleation between the dissipation length and the electron Larmor radius. Our dissipation model provides the possibility to investigate the influence of different damping processes and varying plasma conditions on the dissipation range.",

Seasonal changes of Terra/MODIS satellite indices (NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDSI: Normalized Difference Snow Index, NDWI: Normalized Difference Water Index) in boreal forests of trans-Alaska from 2010 to 2012 have been investigated. It was confirmed that the NDVIs, NDSIs, and NDWIs change clearly with snow existence using the modified time-lapse digital cameras installed under severely cold conditions. In this presentation, we discuss the data obtained until now and the present conditions of the observation network. Further accumulated imagery data studies using the modified time-lapse digital cameras enable us to interpret the implication of satellite-derived indices in terms of the snow and vegetation cover variability on a wide area.",

            "abstract": "We interpret two multi-channel seismic reflection profiles, more than 900 km across the entire Dangerous Grounds, locating in east and west of the southern margin of the South China Sea respectively. Eight Cenozoic sequence boundaries are determined as well as three tectono-stratigraphic units. Detailed analysis of extensional features and unconformities revealed the tectonic in the east and west. Early extension (syn-rifting sequence) occurred in the two profiles during continental rifting, which lasted from Palaeocene to Early Oligocene, and resulted in formation of half-grabens and rotated fault-blocks. Late extension (drift-rifting sequence) has the significant difference in the both profiles. The eastern Dangerous Grounds entered rifting-depression stage and some compressional deformation occurred in the Reed Bank basin at about the beginning of Early Miocene, probably resulting from the collision of the Dangerous Grounds and the Sabah–Cagayan Arc. The western Dangerous Grounds was still in rifting until the end of Early Miocene, forming the MMU or DRU which is strongly erosional and represents a major break in sedimentation and/or erosion in partial area. Denudation fold and inverted fault can be distinguished blow the MMU, indicating the cessation of the South China Sea accompanied the NW compression, while the boundary corresponding the MMU is nearly a plano-conformity in the east. The thermal sag (post-rifting sequence) is characterized by non-faulted draping strata in the whole area. The different structure in east and west may be related to the final evolution of the SCS. When the proto-SCS closed in a scissor fashion plus the clockwise rotation of Borneo, the initial collision (c.20Ma) appeared in east part building the NW foreland basin system from Palawan Trough to Reed Bank in a short-live process, while the west part was drifting southwards until c.15Ma to form the even more remarkable foreland system from Borneo Trough to deep-water Sarawak.",

            "abstract": "Many recent thrust fault earthquakes have involved coseismic surface faulting and folding, revealing the complex nature of surface deformation in active thrust sheets. In this study, we characterize deformation along the active Southern Junggar Thrust (SJT) in the Junggar basin, NW China – which sourced the 1906 M8 Manas earthquake – to gain insight into how fault slip at depth is partitioned between faulting and folding strains at Earth’s surface by integrating deformed terrace records, subsurface geophysical data, and luminescence geochronology. Using a 1-m digital elevation model and field surveys, we have mapped the precise geometries of fluvial terraces across the entire Tugulu anticline, which lies in the hanging wall of the SJT. These profiles reveal progressive uplift of several terraces along prominent fault scarps where the SJT is surface-emergent. Similarly aged terraces are folded in the backlimb of the Tugulu fold, providing a sequential record of surface folding. These folded terraces are progressively rotated such that the oldest terraces are dipping much steeper than younger terraces within the same fold limb. Using 2- and 3-D seismic reflection data, we integrate subsurface deformation constraints with records of surface strain. Structural interpretations of these seismic data define the geometry of the SJT and reveal that folding is localized across synclinal bends along the SJT. We evaluate a range of distinct fault-related fold models (e.g. fault-bend folding, shear fault-bend folding) to assess which structural style best describes the geometries of the subsurface and surface fold patterns. By doing so, we have the opportunity to directly relate surface fault slip measures from terrace folding and uplift to total fault slip at depth. This integration of surface and subsurface deformation - combined with constraints on terrace ages from post-IR IRSL geochronology - allows us to characterize how fault slip and seismic moment are partitioned between surface faulting and folding strains over multiple earthquake cycles.",

            "abstract": "The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) System is the mostly widely used fire danger rating system in the world. We have developed a global database of daily FWI System calculations beginning in 1980 called the Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED) gridded to a spatial resolution of 0.5° latitude by 2/3° longitude. Input weather data were obtained from the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research (MERRA), and two different estimates of daily precipitation from rain gauges over land. FWI System Drought Code calculations from the gridded datasets were compared to calculations from individual weather station data for a representative set of 48 stations in North, Central and South America, Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia and Australia. Agreement between gridded calculations and the station-based calculations tended to be most different at low latitudes for strictly MERRA-based calculations. Strong biases could be seen in either direction: MERRA DC over the Mato Grosso in Brazil reached unrealistically high values exceeding DC=1500 during the dry season but was too low over Southeast Asia during the dry season. These biases are consistent with those previously-identified in MERRA’s precipitation and reinforce the need to consider alternative sources of precipitation data.\nGFWED is being used by researchers around the world for analyzing historical relationships between fire weather and fire activity at large scales, in identifying large-scale atmosphere-ocean controls on fire weather, and calibration of FWI-based fire prediction models. These applications will be discussed.\nMore information on GFWED can be found at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/impacts/gfwed/",

            "abstract": "<span\" roman\"=\"Roman\"\" new=\"New\">The long term observations of aerosol properties from ground-based instrument indicate that aerosol type of mineral dusts, smoke plumes and anthropogenic pollutants can be potentially identified with the characteristics of optical properties, such as Ångström exponent (AE) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA). However, the retrieval of SSA is not frequently available for the application over some of regions from both ground-based observations and satellite retrievals while aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be provided frequently. In order to overcome such kind of limitation (lack of SSA information), this study aims at the spectral variance in AOD for the discrimination of the aerosol types under the constraint on an equivalent amount of particulate matter (PM). The performance of proposed approach in discrimination smoke aerosols from anthropogenic pollutants are examined with MODIS data. After the compared with ground-based observations from AERONET sites and aerosol subtype of CALIPSO product, the results show the well agreement implying that the variation of spectral property within the similar PM concentration is highly practical for the discrimination of aerosol types.\nKeywords: Biomass Burning, Anthropogenic Pollutants, Spectral Property, MODIS, AERONET, CALIPSO",

Among those events, 79 were found to have upstream shock waves and their source locations on the Sun were identified. Using a recipe of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz initial turning direction after shock (Wu et al., 1996, GRL), it is found that the north-south polarity of 66 (83.5%) out of the 79 events were accurately predicted. These events were tested and further analyzed, reaffirming that the Bz intial turning direction was accurate. The results also indicate that 37 of the 79 MCs originate from the north (of the Sun) averaged a Dst_min of -119 nT, whereas 42 of the MCs originating from the south (of the Sun) averaged -89 nT. In an effort to provide this research to others, a website was built that incorporated various tools and pictures to predict the intensity of the geomagnetic storms. The tool is capable of predicting geomagnetic storms with different ranges of Dst_min (from no-storm to gigantic storms).

Accurate representation of HCHO sources, chemistry, and distribution in global models [i.e., chemical transport models (CTMs) and chemistry climate models (CCMs)] is therefore vital for accurate estimation of HOx. Here, we present in situ HCHO observations from the CONTRAST field campaign, conducted in winter 2014 in the remote, tropical western Pacific. Observed HCHO is compared to output from a photochemical box model as well as the CAM-Chem CTM run using winter 2014 meteorology. Both models show consistent underestimation of observed HCHO, indicating possible oceanic HCHO emissions and/or unaccounted VOC sources. Both options are explored. The data will also be compared to output of HCHO in the POLMIP CTMs and newly formed CCMI archives. Implications for HCHO remote sensing will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Textural, modelling and observational evidences indicate the presence of loose to molten debris capping the magma column in the conduit of Strombolian-type volcanoes. This debris is thought to have a role in controlling the release of gas during one explosion and the amount and grain size of the eruption products. Here we report direct observations on the behaviour of debris covering the eruptive vents during Strombolian explosions at Stromboli volcano, Italy. During several field campaigns from 2008 onwards, the eruptive vents were in direct view from our observation point, and volcanic activity was recorded using a variety of video equipment, including high-speed and thermal cameras. Debris-covered vents were observed in several cases. In such cases the explosion was preceded by the gradual, time-exponential bulging of the debris cover, followed, in some cases, by a deflation and in-vent collapse of the debris. The amount and grain size distribution of the debris control the eruptive behaviour. Often, blocks and lapilli may not be entirely removed by explosions, which may occur through the debris and around the larger blocks. In such cases the explosions tend to erupt relatively cold (non-plastic) bombs and lapilli, and minor amounts of ash. Finer-grained debris covers are entirely removed by explosions, and can be entrained in the explosions and collapse separately to form small pyroclastic density currents. The ensuing explosions are invariably ash-rich. Both fine and coarse debris is observed to fall back in the vent after each explosion but also to gravitationally accumulate in between the explosions from the seep crater flanks. In contrast, open-vent eruptions tend to erupt hotter (plastically deforming) pyroclasts at a higher exit velocity.",

            "abstract": "Climate changes talks regularly underline that developing countries’ agriculture could play a stronger role in GHGs mitigation strategies and benefit from the Kyoto Protocol program of subsidies. Scientists explain that agriculture can contribute to carbon mitigation by storing more carbon in the soil through greener cropping systems. In this context, a growing number of research projects have started to investigate how developing countries agriculture can contribute to these objectives.\nThe clean development mechanism (CDM) proposed in the Kyoto protocol is one particular policy instrument that can incite farmers to mitigate the GHG balance towards more sequestration and less emission. Some economists such as Michael Porter think that environmental regulation lead to a win-win outcome, in which case subsidies are not necessary. If it is a trade-off between incomes and the environment, subsidies are required. CDM can be mobilized to support the mitigation strategy.\nAgriculture implies the use of inputs. Reducing the emission implies the reduction of those inputs which will in turn imply a yield decrease. The study aims to assess whether this measure will imply a trade-off between environmental and economic objectives or a win-win situation. I apply this study to the case of small farmers in Burkina Faso through environmental instruments such as the emissions limits and agroforestry using a bioeconomic model, in which the farmers maximize their utility subject to constraints.\nThe study finds that the limitation of emissions in annual crops production involves a trade-off. by impacting negatively their net cash come. By integrating perennial crops in the farming system, the farmers’ utility increases. Around 6,118 kg are sequestrated individually. By computing the value on this carbon balance, farmers’ net cash incomes go better. Then practicing agroforestry is a win-win situation, as they reach a higher level of income, and reduce emissions.\nPolicymakers must encourage small farmers to integrate perennial crops in their annual crops system. Most of small farmers are living below the poverty line. Limiting emissions will get worse their life conditions. To reach the emission reduction objective in the annual crops system, subsidies are needed in order to compensate the income lost through the CDM.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly analysis is a frequently used, standard research product providing a globally complete precipitation analysis based on satellite and gauge information for the period 1979 to the near-present. As a Climate Data Record (CDR) product the current version (Version 2.2) is being transferred to operational production at NOAA NCDC.\nThe current monthly (1979-present), pentad (1979-present) and daily products (1997-present) are composed of a range of datasets with estimates based on gauges, polar-orbiting passive microwave and geostationary infra-red estimates. Over time, the changes in the available observations that comprise GPCP are inevitable, due to changes in the available satellites, instruments available and algorithms used to estimate precipitation. Several such recent changes have necessitated production of an upgrade to the GPCP Version 2 system and these are described in this paper. This update from V2.2 to V2.3 includes a new bias correction for the SSMIS ocean algorithm, a new correction for the transition from TOVS to AIRS and an update to the gauge dataset used over land.\nWe will also describe the development and production of a near-real time version of the CDR. The GPCP CDR is usually produced a few months after real-time due to time lags of input data sets and time necessary for data quality control and the merging process. This time lag has limited its use in the month-by-month (real-time) climate monitoring of global precipitation. Recently, however, based on a significant amount of effort by a number of groups and people associated with the GPCP, the process for producing an Interim CDR product (ICDR, available within 10 days of the end of the month) has been developed and implemented for distribution to the research and operational communities. This allows for a rapid end-of-month analysis, comparison with the GPCP monthly climatology, and the potential for using the data for additional monitoring calculations. This GPCP ICDR uses the same analysis techniques, but not all the input data sets are identical. Comparison between the final CDR product and the ICDR indicate small, but occasionally significant differences. The ICDR will be discussed along with some potential applications for monitoring climate including drought and ENSO.",

            "abstract": "The joint study of pressure (P-) and shear (S-) wave velocities (VP and VS, respectively), as well as their ratio (VP/VS), has been used for many years at large scales (compared to near-surface applications) to study fluids in earth materials. Theoretical and experimental developments have been aimed at understanding the effect of saturation and pore fluids on body wave velocities, more particularly in consolidated media. In the field of hydrocarbon exploration for instance, the measurement of VP/VS ratio helps discriminating different pore fluids in reservoirs. But it is only until recently that this approach has been successfully applied to the characterization of hydrosystems. We showed, thanks to controlled field experiments, the ability of VP/VS ratio in imaging spatial and/or temporal variations of water content at the critical zone scale. These promising results still lack quantitative links between water saturation and seismic properties in such materials and context. We consequently developed laboratory experiments to simulate seismic acquisitions on small-scale controlled granular media with varying water levels. The first results clearly showed the influence of the water level on first arrival times, dispersion and amplitude of the recorded wavefields, and how these measurements could be used as monitoring tools.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of long-term global temperature rise due to an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is a question of relevance to society and policy makers. Previous studies have addressed this issue on the basis of the equilibrium response of the climate system to a doubling of CO2 due to fast feedbacks, such as clouds and sea-ice albedo (Climate or Charney Sensitivity). Here however we use the concept of Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) that additionally includes slow feedbacks such as those derived from changes in the major ice sheets and vegetation distribution.\nWe have produced a robust estimate of ESS using the mid-Pliocene, the last interval in Earth history when CO2 was at modern or near future levels (around 3 million years ago). The mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP; 3.264 to 3.025 Ma) is useful for investigating the concept of ESS because it represents a world in quasi-equilibrium with high CO2 for a sufficient period that the long term feedbacks are close to equilibrium.\nOver 300 simulations have been completed using coupled-atmosphere ocean climate models and Earth System models in order to rigorously estimate ESS. We have performed ensembles of experiments which have perturbed physical components in the models and tested the sensitivity of critical model boundary conditions in order to explore the plausible range of Pliocene-based estimates of ESS. Additionally, we have used output from the international Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) to take into account structural uncertainty in our modelled estimates of ESS.\nOur entire ensemble of plausible mid-Pliocene scenarios demonstrates temperature anomalies of 0-5.5°C between end member CO2 levels of 300 ppmv and 500 ppmv. We present a range of probability density functions to demonstrate the most likely value of ESS based on the modelled scenarios we have included. Our results are compatible with initial studies of ESS (e.g. Lunt et al. 2010) that suggest ESS is between 30% and 50% greater than traditional climate sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Moderate to large earthquakes often rupture and propagate along faults in carbonate-bearing rocks (dolostones, limestones, marbles, etc.). Compared to silicate-bearing rocks, which melt, weaken and wear when sheared at seismic slip rates (ca. 1 m/s), carbonate-bearing rocks do not melt, the minimum friction coefficient can be much lower (down to 5% of static friction) and the wear rate is negligible at seismic slip rates. In cohesive carbonate-bearing rocks, experiments simulating seismic deformation conditions and stopped at slip initiation (< 5 mm) suggest that initial frictional decay down to 50% of static friction is associated with CO2 emission plus formation of nanograins and amorphous carbon. Experiments stopped at larger slips (< 5 mm) show that the slipping zone consists of a foam-like sintered surface overlying a microporous fabric made of calcite and lime (plus periclase in the case of dolomite) nanograins. In non-cohesive rocks (e.g. gouges) a similar evolution is observed after an initial period of strengthening and strain localization. Experiments with pressurized H2O show that the contribution of thermal and thermochemical pressurization is negligible in cohesive and questionable in non-cohesive carbonate-bearing rocks. We propose that initial frictional weakening is due to the formation of patches of amorphous carbon (solid lubricant) at asperity contacts. With progressive slip and bulk temperature increase, nanograins accommodate large strain rates (ca. 104 s-1) by grain boundary sliding as suggested by several authors. The presence of a microporous fabric boosts pore-controlled diffusive process propelled by CO2 gas exhaust due to decarbonation. Enhanced pore-controlled diffusive processes allow (1) efficient mass transfer during grain boundary sliding and (2) sintering of the nanograins into a foam-like slip surface at the end of the experiment.",

            "abstract": "Multiple alternating zonal jets are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and oceans. However, most studies to date have focused on the special case of barotropic jets. Here, the dynamics of freely evolving baroclinic jets are investigated using a two-layer quasigeostrophic annulus model with sloping topography. In a suite of 15 numerical simulations, the baroclinic Rossby radius and baroclinic Rhines scale are sampled by varying the stratification and root-mean-square eddy velocity, respectively. Small-scale eddies in the initial state evolve through geostrophic turbulence and accelerate zonally as they grow in horizontal scale, first isotropically and then anisotropically. This process leads ultimately to the formation of jets, which take about 2500 rotation periods to equilibrate. The kinetic energy spectrum of the equilibrated baroclinic zonal flow steepens from a −3 power law at small scales to a −5 power law near the jet scale. The conditions most favorable for producing multiple alternating baroclinic jets are large baroclinic Rossby radius (i.e., strong stratification) and small baroclinic Rhines scale (i.e., weak root-mean-square eddy velocity). The baroclinic jet width is diagnosed objectively and found to be 2.2–2.8 times larger than the baroclinic Rhines scale, with a best estimate of 2.5 times larger. This finding suggests that Rossby wave motions must be moving at speeds of approximately 6 times the turbulent eddy velocity in order to be capable of arresting the isotropic inverse energy cascade.",

With ongoing urbanization and a growing economy, emissions from different energy sectors remain major contributors to air pollution in India. Emission sectors impact ambient air quality differently due to spatial distribution (typical urban vs. typical rural sources) as well as source height characteristics (low-level vs. high stack sources). This study aims to assess the impacts of emissions from three distinct energy sectors—transportation, domestic, and electricity—on ambient PM2.5­­ in northern India using an advanced air quality analysis framework based on the U.S. EPA Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Present air quality conditions are simulated using 2010 emissions from the Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interaction and Synergies (GAINS) model. Modeled PM2.5 concentrations are compared with satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2010. Energy sector emissions impacts on future (2030) PM2.5 are evaluated with three sensitivity simulations, assuming maximum feasible reduction technologies for either transportation, domestic, or electricity sectors. These simulations are compared with a business as usual 2030 simulation to assess relative sectoral impacts spatially and temporally. CMAQ is modeled at 12km by 12km and include biogenic emissions from the Community Land Model coupled with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols in Nature (CLM-MEGAN), biomass burning emissions from the Global Fires Emissions Database (GFED), and ERA-Interim meteorology generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for 2010 to quantify the impact of modified anthropogenic emissions on ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Energy sector emissions analysis supports decision-making to improve future air quality and public health in India.",

            "abstract": "While scientists have a good theoretical understanding of the heat capacity of both solids and gases, a general theory of the heat capacity of liquids has always remained elusive. Apart from being an awkward hole in our knowledge, heat capacity – the amount of heat needed to change a substance's temperature by a certain amount – is a relevant quantity that it would be nice to be able to predict. I will introduce a phonon-based approach to liquids and supercritical fluids to describe its thermodynamics in terms of sound propagation. I will show that the internal liquid energy has a transverse sound propagation gaps and explain their evolution with temperature variations on the P-T diagram. I will explain how this theoretical framework covers the Debye theory of solids, the phonon theory of liquids, and thermodynamic limits such as the Delong-Petit and the ideal gas thermodynamic limits. As a results, the experimental evidence for the new thermodynamic boundary in the supercritical state (the Frenkel line) on the P-T phase diagram will be demonstrated. Then, I will report on inelastic X-ray scattering experiments combined with the molecular dynamics simulations on deeply supercritical Ar. The presented results unveil the mechanism and regimes of sound propagation in the liquid matter and provide compelling evidence for the adiabatic-to-isothermal longitudinal sound propagation transition. As a result, a universal link will be demonstrated between the positive sound dispersion (PSD) phenomenon and the origin of transverse sound propagation revealing the viscous-to-elastic crossover in compressed liquids. Both can be considered as a universal fingerprint of the dynamic response of a liquid. They can be used then for a signal detection and analysis of a dynamic response in deep water and other fluids which is relevant for describing the thermodynamics of gas giants.  The consequences of this finding will be discussed, including a physically justified way to demarcate the interior and the atmosphere in gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn.",

            "abstract": "The Petschek reconnection model predicts that for antiparallel symmetric conditions, slow-mode shocks should form along reconnection exhaust boundaries, and that the reconnection current sheet should bifurcate. However, closer to the X-line it is expected that Hall physics effects should play a more significant role in controlling the reconnection dynamics. Whilst in-situ observations at the magnetopause and magnetotail have provided a detailed insight into reconnection physics, imprecise knowledge of the spacecraft location both within the reconnection exhaust and relative to the X-line limits the extent to which the spatial structure of reconnection exhausts can be probed. In the solar wind, however, the rapid transit of a spacecraft across the solar wind exhausts allow us to make detailed observations with precise knowledge of the spacecraft location within the jet, such that the magnetic structure of the reconnecting boundary can be directly deduced. If two spacecraft measure the reconnection jets either side of the X-line, this enables a much more precise reconstruction of the reconnection geometry, but this is a rare occurrence.\nHere we present three solar wind reconnection events where different spacecraft (ACE, Cluster and Wind) sampled both of the oppositely directed reconnection exhausts from a common reconnection X-line, which allows us to estimate each spacecraft’s distance from the X-line. We find that in all three cases spacecraft furthest from the reconnection site observed bifurcated current sheets, consistent with Petschek reconnection, whereas spacecraft closer to the reconnection site did not. This suggests that bifurcations of reconnection current sheets develop with increasing distance from the X-line, and that Petschek-type signatures are less developed close to the reconnection site. We discuss these results and consider what may control the point at which these signatures appear, and implications for other reconnection environments.",

            "abstract": "Thawing permafrost soils are expected to shift the chemical composition of DOM exported to and degraded in arctic surface waters. While DOM photo-degradation is an important component of the freshwater C cycle in the Arctic, the molecular controls on DOM photo-degradation remain poorly understood, making it difficult to predict how shifting chemical composition may alter DOM photo-degradation in arctic surface waters. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the susceptibility of DOM draining the shallow organic mat and the deeper permafrost layer to complete photo-oxidation to CO₂ and partial photo-oxidation to compounds that remain in the DOM pool, and investigated changes in DOM chemical composition following sunlight exposure. DOM leached from the organic mat contained higher molecular weight, more oxidized and unsaturated aromatic species compared to permafrost DOM. Despite significant differences in initial chemical composition, permafrost and organic mat DOM had similar susceptibilities to complete photo-oxidation to CO₂. Concurrent losses of carboxyl moieties and shifts in chemical composition during photo-degradation indicated that carboxyl-rich tannin-like compounds in both DOM sources were likely photo-decarboxylated to CO₂. Permafrost DOM had a higher susceptibility to partial photo-oxidation compared to organic mat DOM, potentially due to a lower abundance of phenolic compounds that act as “antioxidants” and slow the oxidation of DOM. These results demonstrated how chemical composition controls the photo-degradation of DOM in arctic surface waters, and that DOM photo-degradation will likely remain an important component of the freshwater C budget in the Arctic with increased export of permafrost DOM to surface waters.",

            "abstract": "The sediment load of rivers constitutes the material that builds the stratigraphic successions found from continental margins to the deep ocean. Measure of this flux is relevant to understanding continental controls on denudation, riverine transport and basin filling. An increasing number of sediment yield measures is available but whether these modern values can be extrapolated at geological timescales for large watersheds is still questioned. One reason is the lack of long-term data. Here, we present a sediment budget for Sub-Saharan West Africa over the Cenozoic to compare with the modern rates. The denudation of this cratonic area is constrained using three regional lateritic paleo-landsurfaces that formed during periods of enhanced weathering since the Paleocene-Eocene greenhouse peak. The 3D interpolation of these surfaces allowed building three successive denudation maps for the 45-24, 24-11 and 11-0 Ma intervals together with reconstructions of the paleo-drainage. The regional distribution of erosion suggests the influence of lithospheric deformation, concentrated around a southern marginal upwarp and eastern hotspot swells. The export of large-scale drainages was calculated by converting denudated volumes into sediment fluxes using the porosity and density of lateritic regolith. Exported volumes calculated for the Niger watershed fall within the same range as the Cenozoic clastic accumulations of the Niger delta. Comparisons also show that modern fluxes can be an order of magnitude above the long-term fluxes for moderately large watersheds but that modern and long-term yields are similar for the largest watersheds (e.g. Niger, Volta, Senegal). These results suggest that the export of very large cratonic watersheds is independent of the measurement timescale and that their modern yields can be extrapolated at long-timescale. Finally, it allows assessing the relative contribution of cratons, i.e. non-active orogenic areas, to the global sediment budgets at geological timescales.",

Flux transfer events are one particular example of dayside transients which play a key role in the transport of energy and momentum through the process of magnetic reconnection. FTEs are widely observed at the dayside magnetopause while also having signatures in the ionosphere, through such events as poleward moving auroral forms or poleward moving radar auroral forms. Here we consider the link between the convection generated by FTEs and the poleward moving radar auroral form to estimate the reconnection voltage and the size of the reconnection line. We will focus on events observed with the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) where we can measure the ionospheric convection over a range of local times. These observations need to be placed in the context of the boundary between the open and closed magnetic flux since we need to calculate the convection across that boundary in the frame of the boundary motion to get the reconnection voltage. We place the observations in the framework of the expanding/contracting polar cap model.",

            "abstract": "A pilot CO2 sequestration test project is underway in offshore Pohang, South Korea. The target brine aquifer for CO2 storage is 100 m-thick sandstone/conglomerate formations at a depth range between 750 and 850 mbsf (meter below seafloor), which were verified by a 3D seismic survey and a cored borehole (980 m deep). We also found that a family of steep-dip, NE-striking faults cross the target aquifer. In order to analyze potential risk of shear activation along the faults, we characterize in situ stress state at the site. Borehole image logs, generated by an acoustic televiewer tool showed borehole breakouts along the whole logged section to ~705 mbsf, which consistently indicate an average maximum horizontal principal stress (SHmax) direction of N135°±15°E. A leak-off test conducted at the bottom of a casing shoe (700 mbsf) yielded the magnitude of the minimum horizontal principal stress (Shmin) of 12.1 MPa, which is lower than the vertical stress (Sv =14.8 MPa). For the given Shmin and Sv conditions, we used the logged breakout widths and laboratory determined rock compressive strength to constrain possible SHmax magnitudes that could create the observed breakouts. Our stress estimation indicates that the stress regime in the CO2 injection test site is in favor of strike-slip faulting (Shmin < Sv < SHmax). We utilized our estimated stress conditions to analyze slip tendency of the faults. All regional-scale faults turn out to have relatively low slip tendency under the given stress condition, suggesting a low risk of triggering shear activation of faults during CO2 injection.",

            "abstract": "The paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field had been increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for understating volcanic processes. Based on the assumption that every volcanic unit record instantaneously the local magnetic field while cooling down is implied that the paleomagnetic directions from different and uncorrelated units can be correlated. Moreover, volcanic successions well-constrained in ages represent an invaluable tool for understanding the variations of the geomagnetic field across the time quasi-continuously. When a reference curve describing in detail the paleosecular variations of directions and intensities is available for a given region, the curves can be safely used to constrain the age of uncorrelated volcanic deposits such as lava cooling units, pyroclastic deposits, and ignimbrites. I present here an overview of examples where I used paleomagnetism as a correlating and dating tool: from the Azores Archipelago (Faial and Terceira), to the Trindade Island (Brazil) and Chile. At the Faial island, a Holocene volcanic cone field history was entirely reconstructed by an extensive paleomagnetic investigation, while at Terceira the last historical eruptive event was successfully correlated and reinterpreted. At the remote Trindade Island, paleomagnetic directions helped to propose an age to the more recent Volcano of the island. Finally in the Chilean volcano of LLaima, the directions obtained from one historical flow are compared with expected values from the global models with interesting insights. In the two examples from the Azores Archipelago, the statistical comparison of the mean paleomagnetic full vector values from the studied deposit with the fluctuations of the geomagnetic field described in the reference curve provided a very good tool for age constraints.",

            "abstract": "In the western Arctic Ocean glacial landforms are interpreted as a complex pattern of Pleistocene glaciations along the continental margin of the East Siberian Sea and the Chukchi borderland. These landforms include moraines, drumlinized features, glacigenic debris flows, till wedges, mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGL), and iceberg plough marks. Orientations of some of the landforms suggest the presence of former ice sheets on the Chukchi Borderland and the East Siberian shelf. In seismic and sub-bottom profiles as well as sediment cores, there is evidence that glaciations have occurred repeatedly. Typically, several generations of glacial wedges intercalate with well-stratified (interglacial) sediments in ice-distal locations. MSGL of former ice grounding in present water depths of more than 1200 m suggests that some ice sheets developed significant thickness and size. The extent of glacial features and deposits into the Arctic Ocean decreased with time. We interpret this as indication that ice sheets in the western Arctic Ocean were thicker and larger during earlier times of the Pleistocene and became restricted to the Chukchi Borderland during the most recent glaciation (Last Glacial Maximum, LGM). Finally, icebergs intensively ploughed the sediments along the Chukchi and East Siberian margin in a range from 350m to 80m present water depth. In water depth shallower than 80m, sub-bottom profiles in the East Siberian Sea exhibit acoustic facies more typical for submarine permafrost. Discontinuous (permafrost) reflectors mask sub-bottom strata beneath an unfrozen 10m thick top sediment layer. In places, unfrozen sediment-filled depressions (taliks) are visible to about 20m below the seafloor, which may be related to former thermokarst and/or channels. We suggest that only during the LGM permafrost formed in the exposed area of the entire East Siberian Sea, whereas some areas have been largely covered by ice sheets during previous glacial periods.",

            "abstract": "Several recent studies using GOSAT total column CO2 measurements have reported a systematic redistribution of carbon fluxes compared to inversions considering only surface-based measurements. Significantly higher emissions are seen from the Tropics, particularly from tropical Africa, and the sink inferred for Europe is consistently larger than what the surface-based measurements suggest, and difficult to reconcile with bottom-up estimates. Controversy has surrounded this issue, with some suggesting that the flux patterns are, in fact, real, while others have argued that it is a result of undiagnosed biases in the measurement or long-range transport. This study presents evidence that the redistribution of fluxes may be explained by the increased spatial density of the satellite measurements, compared to the relatively sparse surface network. Inversions are performed with subsets of the satellite measurements within a given distance of the existing surface sites. As that distance is decreased, the retrieved fluxes converge towards that of the surface-only result. This suggests that the spatial pattern of fluxes inferred from the surface sites is, in fact, biased. This hypothesis is tested with a variety of pseudo-data experiments, to help explain why this might be. Chemical and transport processes leading to this discrepancy are discussed.",

            "abstract": "We perform an analysis of tidal signals recorded in the borehole strainmeters of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) in the United States of America. We decompose the original strain data into various components of tide signal and other terms including a trend, air pressure response and random noise, using BAYTAP, a program that applies a Bayesian modeling procedure to analyze the strainmeter data. We find an anomalous strong S1 strain tide (with a frequency of 1 cycle/day) recorded in the strainmeters with three distinct characteristics: 1) the extracted S1 strain tide has abnormally strong amplitudes (50-200 times larger than that of the normal standard S1 tide); 2) the S1 strain amplitudes exhibit a linear relationship with air pressure S1 amplitude; and 3) the S1 strain tide has a phase lag of 0-90° from the air pressure S1 tide. Various quantitative analyses suggest that the observed anomalous S1 strain tide cannot be explained by loading of ocean water or thermoelastic response of rock to daily temperature change. Neither can it be explained by elastic loading of air pressure, as elastic response would result in no phase lag between them. We suggest that the observed anomalous strain S1 tide can be best explained by viscous response to the loading of air pressure S1 tide, resulting in a linear correlation between the amplitudes of the two tides but with a phase lag. Using a Maxwell viscoelastic model, we estimate the viscosity of the Earth’s top materials (between the surface and strainmeter buried depth) is at the order of 1015 Pas. Such a viscosity value is much smaller than the normal viscosity of the rock (1021 Pas) and suggests that the physical behavior of the top thin layer of the Earth’s surface is very different than we have assumed.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural production is directly related to water management and water supply. The temporal distribution of water use throughout the growing season can significantly influence crop yield, and the facility to manage both the timing and amount of irrigation water may result in higher yields. The crop-water production function quantitatively evaluates the relationship between seasonal water use and crop yield. Previous efforts have attempted to describe and formalize the crop-water production function as a single-variable function of seasonal water use. However, these representations do not account for the effects of temporal distribution of water use and trivialize the associated variability in yields by assuming an optimized or arbitrary temporal distribution of soil moisture. This over-simplification renders the function inappropriate for recommendations related to irrigation scheduling, water management, economically optimal irrigation, water and agricultural productivity, and assessing the role of full and supplementary irrigation. We propose field kites, a novel representation of the crop-water production function that explicitly acknowledges crop yield variability as a function of both seasonal water use and associated temporal distributions of water use. Field kites are a tool that explicitly considers the farmers’ capacity to manage their water resources, to more appropriately evaluate the optimal depth of irrigation water under water-limiting conditions. The field kite for winter wheat is presented both generally and cultivar- and climate-specific for Western Canada. The field kites are constructed using AquaCrop and previously validated cultivar-specific variables. Field kites provide the tools for water authorities and policy makers to evaluate agricultural production as it relates to farm water management, and to determine appropriate policies related to developing and supporting the necessary irrigation infrastructure to increase water productivity.",

The observed omnidirectional differential flux of quiet-time superhalo electrons generally fits to a power-law spectrum, J~E-β, with an average index β of ~2.4. Thus, superhalo electrons appear to be one of the most common electron acceleration phenomena in the heliosphere. The superhalo power-law spectrum shows no obvious correlation with sunspot number and solar wind core populations. If they are formed by acceleration through the IPM, then solar wind halo/strahl electrons can provide seed electrons for such acceleration.

            "abstract": "Typical data sources for both basic and mission-focused environmental research include satellite sensors, in situ observations made by scientists, and data from well established and often government-sponsored networks. While these data sources enable substantial advances in understanding our environment, they are not always complete in the picture they present. By incorporating citizen science into our portfolio of observations, we gain a powerful complement to these traditional data sources, drawing on the enthusiasm and commitment of volunteer observers. While such data can be more difficult to calibrate or quality check, these challenges can be overcome by clear and simple protocols and consistent instrumentation. One such example is the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS) in which thousands of volunteers in the United States and Canada use low-cost equipment to make point-measurements of rain, hail and snowfall near their homes or workplaces. All participants in CoCoRaHS make these measurements with the same $30 rain gauges and follow a well-established protocol in which they are trained. These observations feed into National Weather Service forecast models, sometimes directly influencing the issuing of alerts and warnings, and are used to both validate and improve these models. In other cases, observations can be more subjective, such as Buddhist monks in the Catskills documenting leaf fall, or the Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count in which birds are surveyed annually as their habitats change. The uncertainty associated with such subjective measurements is far outweighed by the value of the data, and it can be reduced by increasing the numbers of observers and encouraging participation by the same observers year after year for consistent inputs. These citizen science efforts, and many others like them, provide tremendous scientific opportunities for complementing big-picture science with local variability, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of our environment. In this presentation we will also argue that along with data, another by-product is increased science literacy, since participation encourages citizens to think about their surroundings and increases their awareness of environmental change.",

            "abstract": "The space-based view of Earth has changed the way we look at our home planet, providing a perspective on the Earth as a system that can only be realized when viewed from a distance. Throughout my career as a researcher, including 2 years as NASA Chief Scientist, this “power of perspective” has been a tool through which I have engaged both colleagues and the public. These capabilities have transformed our understanding of climate and weather phenomena, ecosystem dynamics, changes in the cryosphere, and much more, through their macro-scale look at the various, highly complex components of the Earth system. But within these domains, there is a tremendous amount of small-scale variability that, if appropriately observed, can reveal new information about how elements within the Earth system work in ways that can directly impact people’s lives. Consequently, there is a different power in this additional local perspective: it is one fueled by up-close and personal data collection. Through their engagement and commitment, citizen scientists are providing valuable data as well as personalized experience in the collection of those data. This presentation will include video clips that show a diverse set of citizen science projects in North America and worldwide, illustrating this scientifically useful combination of local and global. Such projects engage citizens and scientists alike in efforts to understand the world in which we live.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the physical state of the solar corona is key to deciphering the origins of space weather as well as to realistically representing the environment to be navigated by missions such as Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus. However, inverting solar coronal observations to reconstruct this physical state -- and in particular the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field – is complicated by limited lines of sight and by projection effects. On the other hand, the sensitivity of multiwavelength observations to different physical mechanisms implies a potential for simultaneous probing of different parts of the coronal plasma. In order to study this complementarity, and to ultimately establish an optimal set of observations for constraining the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field, we are developing a suite of representative simulations to act as diagnostic test beds. We will present three such test beds: a coronal active region, a quiescent prominence, and a global corona. Each fully define the physical state of density, temperature, and vector magnetic field in three dimensions throughout the simulation domain. From these test beds, and using the FORWARD SolarSoft IDL codes, we will create a broad range of synthetic data. Radio observables will include intensity and circular polarization (including gyroresonance effects) and Faraday rotation for a range of frequencies. Infrared and visible forbidden line diagnostics of Zeeman and saturated Hanle effects will yield full Stokes vector (I, Q, U, V) synthetic data, and UV permitted line Hanle diagnostics will yield intensity and linear polarization. In addition, we will synthesize UV and SXR imager data, UV/EUV spectrometric data, and white light brightness and polarized brightness. All of these synthetic data, along with the “ground truth” physical state of the simulations from which they are derived, will be made available to the community for the purpose of testing coronal inversion techniques.",

            "abstract": "North Africa is highly vulnerable to hydrologic variability and extremes, including impacts of climate change. Prior North African studies largely disagree regarding the dominant oceanic drivers of the region’s hydrologic variability and the likely impacts of climate change. Here, we aim to apply a multivariate statistical method, the Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Assessment (GEFA), to evaluate the representation of the oceanic drivers of North African rainfall in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Five (CMIP5) in comparison to a GEFA-based observational benchmark. The reliability of the statistical GEFA method is first evaluated against dynamical experiments within the Community Earth System Model (CESM), with initial focus on the atmospheric response to sea-surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. In order to estimate the minimum number of years of data needed to obtain stable GEFA response estimates to individual SST forcings, given large atmospheric internal variability, we apply GEFA to data records of varying durations from the CESM Large Ensemble historical simulations. After validating the GEFA method, we apply the statistical approach to both CESM and a range of CMIP5 models in order to elucidate the models’ representation of oceanic drivers of North African rainfall. The observed oceanic forcings of North African rainfall, as investigated in a parallel study, serves as the benchmark for evaluating each model’s performance and credibility in terms of future climate projections.",

            "abstract": "We estimate Nubia-Somalia rotations at ~1-Myr intervals for the past 20 Myr from newly available, high-resolution reconstructions of the Southwest Indian Ridge and reconstructions of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The former rotations are based on many more data, extend farther back in time, and have more temporal resolution than has previously been the case. Nubia-Somalia plate motion has remained remarkably steady since 5.2 Ma. For example, at the northern end of the East Africa rift, our Nubia-Somalia plate motion estimates at six different times between 0.78 Ma and 5.2 Ma agree to within 3% with the rift-normal component of motion that is extrapolated from the recently estimated Saria et al. (2014) GPS angular velocity. Over the past 10.6 Myr, the Nubia-Somalia rotations predict 42±4 km of rift-normal extension across the northern segment of the Main Ethiopian Rift. This agrees with approximate minimum and maximum estimates of 40 km and 53 km for post-10.6-Myr extension from seismological surveys of this narrow part of the plate boundary and is also close to 55-km and 48±3 km estimates from published and our own reconstructions of the Nubia-Arabia and Somalia-Arabia seafloor\nspreading histories for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Our new rotations exclude at high confidence level two previously published estimates of Nubia-Somalia motion based on inversions of Chron 5n.2 along the Southwest Indian Ridge, which predict rift-normal extensions of 13±14 km and 129±16 km across the Main Ethiopian Rift since 11 Ma. Constraints on Nubia-Somalia motion before ~15 Ma are weaker due to sparse coverage of pre-15-Myr magnetic reversals along the Nubia-Antarctic plate boundary, but appear to require motion before 15 Ma. Nubia-Somalia rotations that we estimate from a probabilistic analysis of geometric and age constraints from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden are consistent with those determined from Southwest Indian Ridge data, particularly for the past 11 Myr. Nubia-Somalia rotations determined from the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden rotations and Southwest Indian Ridge rotations independently predict that motion during its oldest phase was highly oblique to the rift and a factor-of-two or more faster than at present, although large uncertainties remain in the rotation estimates for times before ~15 Ma.",

            "abstract": "There are an increasing number of global, regional and local processes that are in need of integrated ocean information. In the sciences ocean information is needed to support physical ocean and climate studies for example within the World Climate Research Programme and its CLIVAR project, biogeochemical issues as articulated by the GCP, IMBER and SOLAS projects of ICSU-SCOR and Future Earth. This knowledge gets assessed in the area of climate by the IPCC and biodiversity by the IPBES processes. The recently released first World Ocean Assessment focuses more on ecosystem services and there is an expectation that the Sustainable Development Goals and in particular Goal 14 on the Ocean and Seas will generate new demands for integrated ocean observing from Climate to Fish and from Ocean Resources to Safe Navigation and on a healthy, productive and enjoyable ocean in more general terms.\nIn recognition of those increasing needs for integrated ocean information we have recently launched the Horizon 2020 AtlantOS project to promote the transition from a loosely-coordinated set of existing ocean observing activities to a more integrated, more efficient, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose Atlantic Ocean Observing System. AtlantOS takes advantage of the Framework for Ocean observing that provided strategic guidance for the design of the project and its outcome.\nAtlantOS will advance the requirements and systems design, improving the readiness of observing networks and data systems, and engaging stakeholders around the Atlantic. AtlantOS will bring Atlantic nations together to strengthen their complementary contributions to and benefits from the internationally coordinated Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Blue Planet Initiative of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).\nAtlantOS will fill gaps of the in-situ observing system networks and will ensure that their data are readily accessible and useable. AtlantOS will demonstrate the utility of integrating in-situ and remotely sensed Earth observations to produce information products supporting a wide range of sectors. AtlantOS will support activities to share best practice, integrate data streams and promote the standardization of in-situ observations. AtlantOS will promote network integration, optimization and new technologies.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault, New Zealand, is a major plate-bounding fault that accommodates 65-75% of the total relative motion between the Australian and Pacific plates. The absence of measurable contemporary surface deformation has been interpreted to indicate that the fault slips mostly in quasi-periodic large earthquakes (< Mw 8.0). In order to understand the mechanics of earthquakes, it is important to study the evolution of frictional properties of the fault rocks under conditions representative of the potential hypocentral depth. Here, we present experimental data obtained on DFDP-1 drill core samples of rocks that surround the principal slip zone(s) (PSZ) of the Alpine Fault and the PSZ itself. Simulated fault gouges were sheared under high pressure and temperature conditions in a hydrothermal ring shear apparatus. We performed experiments at temperatures of 25, 150, 300, 450 and 600 °C. Results show the occurrence of potentially unstable, velocity-weakening behaviour at low slip velocity at 150 °C. With increasing temperature, velocity-weakening occurs over a wider range of slip velocities; notably it is restricted to higher velocities at temperatures of 450 and 600 ºC. Additionally, the frictional strength decreases markedly for very low slip velocities (<0.3 μm/s) for the sample derived from the PSZ. Moreover, shear stress depends linearly on effective normal stress, indicating shearing is essentially frictional. No transition to ductile (normal stress independent) flow was observed and we speculate that it is postponed to higher temperature or lower slip rates due to the simultaneous operation of thermally activated processes and granular flow in the porous gouges. The AF should be able to nucleate earthquakes at temperatures up to at least 300 °C. The low frictional strength observed at higher temperatures and low velocity indicates that the AF is able to creep at low levels of differential stress at deeper levels, but can become unstable if slip accelerates.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols effects on clouds and precipitation are one of the key components of the climate system and the hydrological cycle. However, the level of scientific understanding concerning aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions is still low (Boucher et al., 2013), because these processes are linked to many factors like cloud regime (Stevens and Feingold, 2009) or meteorological condition (Loeb and Schuster 2008, Su et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2008; 2012), leading to a high process complexity (Andersen and Cermak, 2015).\nIn January 2013, heavy air pollution was observed over most parts of northern and central China (Tao et al., 2014; Uno et al., 2014). It was also identified in Korea with a time lag of a couple of days (12 January 2013). The episode has synoptic setting such as weak trough at 850hPa moving through the northern Korean peninsula during 11-12 January, leading to the dominant westerly winds over Korea. PM10 mass concentrations increased significantly over Korea since early 12 January with its average value in excess of 200mg/m3. Interestingly, Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) forecasted precipitation would end at noon of 12 January, but it lasted until 21 LST. In contrast, there was no precipitation over the southern part of the Korean peninsula.\nBased on the above observation, to understand the aerosols effects on clouds and precipitation in Korea, we have analyzed the relationship of PM10 to MODIS cloud properties (Cloud Optical Depth; COD, cloud effective radius; re, Liquid Water Path; LWP) in terms of north-south gradient. We found the smaller effective radius in the mid-Korean peninsula, with an increase in COD, whereas a larger effective radius and reduced COD shown in the southern-Korean peninsula. It implies the increased aerosol loadings transported from China can modify cloud microphysical properties over middle Korean peninsula. Meteorological environment condition will be also checked out especially including water vapor along with variations in cloud properties. The quantitative evaluations of its modification need more detailed modeling works.",

            "abstract": "West Africa is a region with six different climatic zones including a rich savannah affected by biomass burning annually, the Niger delta oil producing region with major gas flaring sites and a long coastline. Research on atmospheric pollution using remotely sensed data over West Africa has mostly been conducted at regional scale or for individual countries, with little emphasis on the dynamics of climatic zones and the diversity of land cover types. This study analyses annual seasonal dynamics of emissions of two ozone precursors stratified by climatic zone: nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from OMI and carbon monoxide (CO) from TES. The different sources of these pollutants and their seasonality are explicitly considered. Results indicate that the highest annual wet season NO2 column concentrations were in the semi-arid zone (1.33 x 1015 molecules cm-2) after prolonged periods of low soil moisture while the highest dry season were observed in the wet sub-humid zone (2.62 x 1015 molecules cm-2) where the savannah fires occur annually. The highest annual CO concentrations (> 3.1 x 1018 molecules cm-2) were from the Niger Delta, located in the humid zone. There were indications of atmospheric transport of CO from the southern hemisphere in the west season. Climate change induced soil moisture variability was most prominent in the dry sub-humid and semi-arid climatic zones (±0.015m3m-3) . The causal effects of soil moisture variability on NO2 emissions and their seasonal cycles were tested using the Granger causality test. Causal effects of inter-zonal exchanges/transport of NO2 and CO emissions respectively were inferred using Directed Acyclic Graphs. The results indicate that NO2, CO and their seasonal ratios are strongly affected by changes in soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Land surface air temperature products have been essential for monitoring the evolution of the climate system. Before a temperature dataset is included in such reports, it is important that non-climatic influences be removed or changed so the dataset is considered homogenous. These inhomogeneities include changes in station location, instrumentation and observing practices. Very few datasets are free of these influences and therefore require homogenization schemes. While many homogenized products exist on the monthly time scale, few daily products exist, due to the complication of removing break points that are truly inhomogeneous rather than solely by chance (for example, sharp changes due to synoptic conditions). Since there is a high demand for sub-monthly monitoring tools, there is a need to address these issues.\nThe Global Historical Climatology Network – Daily dataset provides a strong foundation of the Earth’s climate on the daily scale, and is the official archive of daily data in the United States. While the dataset adheres to a strict set of quality assurance, no daily adjustments are applied. However, this dataset lays the groundwork for other products distributed at NCEI-Asheville, including the climate divisional dataset (nClimDiv), the North American monthly homogenized product (Northam) and the 1981-2010 Normals. Since these downstream products already provide homogenization and base period schemes, it makes sense to combine these datasets to provide a sub-monthly monitoring tool for the United States.\nUsing these datasets already in existence, monthly adjustments are applied to daily data, and then anomalies are created using a base climatology defined by the 1981-2010 Normals. Station data is then aggregated to the state level and then regions defined by the National Climate Assessment. Ranks are then created to provide informational monitoring tools that could be of use for public dissemination. This presentation goes over the product, including methodology, latest results, validation schemes, sources of uncertainty, and addressing future steps. It also provides an assessment of selected notable recent extreme events.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Superior basin experienced multiple episodes of glaciation, resulting in a variety of glacial deposits and landforms, most of which date to the final retreat of Laurentide ice from the basin. Prominent among these features are moraines and thick glacial lacustrine varve sequences in the central part of the lake. Because these features are now beneath deep water, they can be well imaged by modern marine seismic-reflection methods, providing a variety of insights into glacial processes and history. Two prominent moraines occur east of Isle Royale, and other morainal deposits exist. The prominent moraines are as much as 75 m high, asymmetric, and locally concave down-ice in plan view. They are steeper up-ice than down, but vary in morphology along strike. Air-gun seismic-reflection data show that the moraines are underlain by thick, acoustically massive deposits (till) over a smooth bedrock surface, and that, in front of the moraines, the till grades laterally into increasingly stratified deposits interpreted as glacial lacustrine outwash. Such lateral relations between till and outwash are rarely displayed so well in natural exposures. The moraines relate to the Marquette advance of the Laurentide ice sheet, but they are difficult to directly correlate with the terrestrial deposits used to define that advance. Overlying the till and moraines is a thick sequence of glacial lacustrine varves, which are well imaged by high-resolution CHIRP seismic-reflection profiles. Although the CHIRP data cannot resolve even the thickest of the individual varves, the section comprises distinct acoustic packages. The CHIRP data show that the base of the varve sequence becomes younger to the northeast, the direction of ice retreat. Throughout the varved sequence are lenses of acoustically massive material and local features interpreted as iceberg plow marks, which are especially concentrated at one horizon. Limited 3-D seismic data show the curvilinear plan view of the plough marks at this horizon, and the horizon can be mapped throughout the central part of the basin. These features indicate that ice retreat from the basin was not instantaneous or simple in detail.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon dating of microfossils in deep sea cores has many caveats. Of these, three are the most problematic: bioturbation, dissolution, and lateral sediment redistribution. We attempted to isolate these caveats by selecting cores with different sedimentation rates and water depths. Our ultimate goal is to identify a foraminifer species that is affected the least by these caveats and thus is the most reliable for age dating. We present species-specific radiocarbon ages, whole assemblage counts, and calculations of sediment mixing rates in two cores extending to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM): Y69-71 in the Panama Basin and MD98-2177 in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Thorium normalization yields high lateral sediment redistribution in Y69-71 which is located below the lysocline. MD98-2177 has high sediment accumulation rates (~50cm/kyr) and is located above the lysocline. We found large disagreement among the ages of co-occurring microfossils in several horizons (up to 2000 years) in MD98-2177. Based on our whole assemblage counts bracketing these horizons, we conclude that bioturbation is the most likely agent of age discrepancy among co-occurring sedimentary components in MD98-2177 despite its high sedimentation rate. Surprisingly, the age offset among co-occurring components is reduced in Y69-71, especially during the LGM when the sediment focusing factor was about 8. This may suggest that sediment focusing was not disruptive enough to hinder the accurate dating of sediment layers in this core, especially during the LGM when foraminifer preservation was good. Lastly, we conclude that shells of G. menardii may be the most reliable for dating due to their flat morphology and high dissolution resistance.",

            "abstract": "Many gravel-bed rivers exhibit historic straightening or embanking, reducing river complexity and the available habitat for key species such as salmon. A defensible method for predicting salmonid spawning habitat is an important tool for anyone engaged in assessing a river restoration. Most empirical methods to predict spawning habitat use lookup tables of depth, velocity and substrate. However, natural site selection is different: salmon must pick a location where they can successfully build a redd, and where eggs have a sufficient survival rate. Also, using dimensional variables, such as depth and velocity, is problematic: spawning occurs in rivers of differing size, depth and velocity range. Non-dimensional variables have proven useful in other branches of fluid dynamics, and instream habitat is no different. Empirical river data has a high correlation between observed salmon redds and Froude number, without insight into why. Here we present a physics based model of spawning and bedform evolution, which shows that Froude number is indeed a rational choice for characterizing the bedform, substrate, and flow necessary for spawning. It is familiar for Froude to characterize surface waves, but Froude also characterizes longitudinal bedform in a mobile bed river. We postulate that these bedforms and their hydraulics perform two roles in salmonid spawning: allowing transport of clasts during redd building, and oxygenating eggs. We present an example of this Froude number and substrate based habitat characterization on a Scottish river for which we have detailed topography at several stages during river restoration and subsequent evolution of natural processes. We show changes to the channel Froude regime as a result of natural process and validate habitat predictions against redds observed during 2014 and 2015 spawning seasons, also relating this data to the Froude regime in other, nearby, rivers. We discuss the use of the Froude spectrum in providing an indicator of salmonid spawning and the success of river restoration.",

            "abstract": "The Canadian Network on Aerosols and Climate: Addressing Key Uncertainties in Remote Canadian Regions (or NETCARE) was established in 2013 to study the interactions between aerosols, chemistry, clouds and climate. The network brings together Canadian academic and government researchers, along with key international collaborators. Attention is being given to observations and modeling of Arctic aerosol, with the goal to understand underlying processes and so improve predictions of aerosol climate forcing. Motivation to understand the summer Arctic atmosphere comes from the retreat of summer sea ice and associated increase in marine influence.\nTo address these goals, a suite of measurements was conducted from two platforms in summer 2014 in the Canadian Arctic, i.e. an aircraft-based campaign on the Alfred Wegener Institute POLAR 6 and an ocean-based campaign from the CGCS Amundsen icebreaker. NETCARE-POLAR was based out of Resolute Bay, Nunavut during an initial period of little transport and cloud-free conditions and a later period characterized by more transport with potentially biomass burning influence. Measurements included particle and cloud droplet numbers and size distributions, aerosol composition, cloud nuclei, and levels of gaseous tracers. Ultrafine particle events were more frequently observed in the marine boundary layer than above, with particle growth observed in some cases to cloud condensation nucleus sizes. The influence of biological processes on atmospheric constituents was also assessed from the ship during NETCARE-AMUNDSEN, as indicated by high measured levels of gaseous ammonia, DMS and oxygenated VOCs, as well as isolated particle formation and growth episodes. The cruise took place in Baffin Bay and through the Canadian archipelago. Interpretation of the observations from both campaigns is enhanced through the use of chemical transport and particle dispersion models.\nThis talk will provide an overview of NETCARE Arctic observational and related modeling activities, focusing on 2014 Arctic activities and highlighting upcoming presentations within the session and the work of individual research teams. An attempt will be made to synthesize the observations and model results, drawing connections of aerosol sources through to cloud formation and deposition processes.",

Detection and attribution studies have shown that the reduction in Northern Hemisphere precipitation over the second half of the 20th century is driven by anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Here we apply these same methods to investigate changes in the West African and South Asian monsoons and identify the source regions of the anthropogenic aerosols that drive the observed changes. Historical climate model simulations are used to derive fingerprints of aerosol forcing for different regions of the globe. Comparing model changes with observations show that the changes in West African monsoon preciptiation are driven by remote aerosol emissions from North America and Europe, while changes in South Asian monsoon precipitation are driven by local aerosol emissions.",

            "abstract": "A decrease in longitudinal connectivity in riverine ecosystems resulting from the construction of transverse barriers has been identified as a major threat to biodiversity. For example, Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) have a seasonal variety of hydraulic habitat requirements for their different life stages. However, hydropower impoundments impact the spatial and temporal connectivity of natural habitat along many salmon rivers in ways that are not fully understood. Yet, these changes may affect the sustainability of habitat at local and regional scales and so ultimately the conservation of the species. Research is therefore needed both to aid the restoration and management of rivers impacted by previous hydropower development and guide new schemes to mitigate potentially adverse effects. To this end we assessed the effects of hydropower development on the flow related habitat conditions for different salmon life stages in Scottish rivers at different spatial scales. We used GIS techniques to map the changes in structural connectivity at regional scales, applying a weighting for habitat quality. Next, we used hydrological models to simulate past and present hydrologic conditions that in turn drive reach-scale hydraulic models to assess the impacts of regulation on habitat suitability in both space and time. Preliminary results indicate that: 1) impacts on connectivity depend on the location of the barrier within the river network; 2) multiple smaller barriers may have a potentially lower impact than a single larger barrier; 3) there is a relationship between habitat and connectivity where losing less but more suitable habitat potentially has a disproportionally large impact; 4) the impact of flow regulation can lead to a deterioration of habitat quality, though the effects are spatially variable and the extent of the impact depends on salmon life stage. This work can form a basis for using natural processes to perform targeted and cost-effective restoration of rivers.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the spatiotemporal variability of two sets of daily precipitation from the ERA-Interim reanalysis across the eastern United States between 1979-2013: 1) total precipitation, and 2) precipitation originating from tropical moisture exports (TMEs), which have been linked to extremes of midlatitude precipitation. We introduce archetypal analysis (AA) as a new method to decompose and characterize structures within the spatiotemporal climate data. AA is uniquely suited to identify extremal patterns and is a complementary method to Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. We provide a brief comparison between AA and EOF analysis and then examine the spatiotemporal variability, circulation anomalies, and sea surface temperature teleconnections associated with the archetypes of the two precipitation variables. Markovian structure, seasonal variability, and inter-annual trends in archetype occurrence are explored using nonparametric generalized linear models (GLMs). Results show that the modes of precipitation variability and their associated teleconnections are very similar between total and TME precipitation, suggesting that TMEs can help explain prevailing modes of total precipitation variability. Both total and TME precipitation shift longitudinally conditional on the phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, and they are inhibited during strong, negative PDO and positive Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) regimes. The GLM analysis reveals distinct seasonal cycles and decadal trends in archetypes likely associated with the strength and position of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH).",

            "abstract": "Glacial earthquakes is a class of seismic events of magnitude up to 5, occurring primarily in Greenland, in the margins of large marine-terminated glaciers with near-grounded termini. They are caused by calving of cubic-kilometer scale unstable icebergs which penetrate the full-glacier thickness and, driven by the buoyancy forces, capsize against the calving front. These phenomena produce seismic energy including surface waves with dominant energy between 10-150 s of period whose seismogenic source is compatible with the contact force exerted on the terminus by the iceberg while it capsizes. A reverse motion and posterior rebound of the terminus have also been measured and associated with the fluctuation of this contact force. Using a finite element model of iceberg and glacier terminus coupled with simplified fluid-structure interaction model, we simulate calving and capsize of icebergs. Contact and frictional forces are measured on the terminus and compared with laboratory experiments. We also study the influence of various factors, such as iceberg geometry, calving style and terminus interface. Being extended to field environments, the simulation results are compared with forces obtained by seismic waveform inversion of registered glacial earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Drilling at IODP Site U1438, located immediately west of Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR), the site of IBM subduction initiation, penetrated 1460 m of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock and 150 m of underlying basement. Biostratigraphic controls indicate a probable age for the oldest sedimentary rocks at around 55 Ma (51-64 Ma – Arculus et al., Nat Geosci in-press). This is close to the 48-52 Ma time period of IBM subduction initiation, based on studies in the forearc. There, the first products of volcanism are tholeiitic basalts termed FAB (forearc basalt), which are more depleted than average MORB and show subtle indicators of subduction geochemical enrichment (Reagan et al., 2010 – Geochem Geophy Geosy). Shipboard data indicate that Site U1438 basement basalts share many characteristics with FABs, including primitive major elements (high MgO/FeO*) and strongly depleted incompatible element patterns (Ti, Zr, Ti/V and Zr/Y below those of average MORB). Initial results thus indicate that FAB geochemistry may have been produced not only in the forearc, but also in backarc locations (west of the KPR) at the time of subduction initiation. Hf-Nd isotopes for Site 1438 basement basalts show a significant range of compositions from εNd of 7.0 to 9.5 and εHf of 14.5 to 19.8 (present-day values). The data define a well-correlated and steep array in Hf-Nd isotope space. Relatively radiogenic Hf compared to Nd indicates an Indian Ocean-type MORB source, but the dominant signature, with εHf >16.5, is more radiogenic than most Indian MORB. The pattern through time is from more-to-less radiogenic and more variable Hf-Nd isotopes within the basement section. This pattern culminates in basaltic andesite sills, which intrude the lower parts of the sedimentary section. The sills have the least radiogenic compositions measured so far (εNd ~6.6, εHf ~13.8), and are similar to those of boninites of the IBM forearc and modern IBM arc and reararc rocks. The pattern within the basement suggests modest enrichment of a depleted Indian MORB source over time.",

            "abstract": "One of the challenges when measuring eddy-covariance fluxes with closed gas analyzers is high frequency attenuation due to the passage of the sampled air through a gas sampling system (GSS). The problem is particularly relevant for gases that undergo strong sorption processes, such as H2O. Recent “enclosed” analyzer designs (e.g. LI-7200, LI-COR Biosciences Inc.) mitigate the problem by allowing a reduced length of the intake tube (<1 m). Further improvements can come from carefully designed filtering and heating systems that reduce hygroscopic particulates and H2O adsorption on GSS surfaces.\nBecause the sorption processes of H2O increase exponentially with air relative humidity (RH), low-pass filtering effects can be reduced by reducing RH inside the GSS, for example by increasing air temperature via heating. In this work, we evaluate the effects of several heating strategies with the aim of optimizing the LI-7200 performance while limiting the implied increase in power consumption.\nFrom field tests we found that 4 W of heating applied uniformly to a rain cap-integrated 2 µm particulate filter (FW-series, Swagelok) and a 700 mm stainless steel tube with 4.8 mm inner diameter reduces the occurrence of problematic RH levels (>60%) in the LI-7200 by ≈50%. As a result, the system half-power frequency increased by ≈1 Hz, and the remaining cospectral correction did not exceed 3%, even at very high ambient RH (95%).\nWhile little further improvement was found for increased heating powers, it is possible to optimize the sequence of GSS components and their heating: we found that positioning the particulate filter ≈20 cm downstream of the rain cap and concentrating 2/3 of the heat in this first 20 cm, and 1/3 in the remainder of the tube, provides optimal performances. Using model cospectra and a range of realistic measurement and environmental conditions, we estimated H2O spectral corrections to reduce by ≈50-70%, getting very close to those of CO2 in most conditions of interest.",

CO2, water and energy fluxes, as well as atmospheric concentrations of gaseous N compounds and aerosols, were measured continuously throughout the year. Field campaigns were carried out during the wet and dry season to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes. The results showed that the tropical forest was acting as C-sink (6-8 MgC ha-1 yr-1).\nOther measurements and results concerned:\nthe role of CO2 fertilization by analyzing wood growth rings of long-lived trees, with the longest (≈ 400 years) chronology for tropical forests;\n14C measurements of soil organic matter age and turnover, showing the critical role that soil may have on the net organic C accumulation in tropical forests;\nthe role of soil as CH4 source even in forests not visibly flooded;\nthe role of tropical forests as natural source of N2O;\nthe application of advanced remote sensing techniques, such as discrete and wave forms LiDAR, to assess tropical forests biomass and biodiversity.\nAll these data were combined with other modeling and observing efforts to reassess the African continent GHG budget. The results showed that Africa is a small sink of carbon (-0.61±0.58 PgC yr-1), but the emissions of CH4 and N2O turn it into a net source of radiative forcing in CO2 equivalent terms. Uncertainties however are still very high. In order to constrain such uncertainty it is of paramount importance to increase the density of observations in space and time so to cover the complex and dynamic temporal and spatial variability of African ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The European Space Agency's JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft is planned for launch in 2022 and arrival at Jupiter in 2030. It will observe the planet Jupiter and three of its largest moons, Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. One instrument on the JUICE spacecraft is the Sub-millimeter Wave Instrument (SWI), which will measure brightness temperatures from Jupiter's stratosphere and troposphere, and from subsurfaces of Jupiter’s icy moons. In the baseline configuration SWI consists of two tunable sub-millimeter wave receivers operating from 530 to 625 GHz. As an alternative one of the receivers could cover the range of 1080 and 1275 GHz. Inversion models are strongly dependent on the knowledge of the complex relative permittivity (hereafter permittivity) of the target material to retrieve the physical properties of the subsurface (e.g. [1][2]).\nWe set up a laboratory experiment allowing us to perform reproducible measurements of the complex scattering parameters S11 and S21 in the ranges of 70 to 110 GHz, of 100 to 160 GHz, of 140 to 220 GHz, of 140 to 220 GHz and of 510 to 715 GHz. These scattering parameters can be used to retrieve the permittivity of icy analogs of the surfaces and subsurfaces of Jupiter's icy moons in order to prepare the data interpretation of SWI [3]. The measurements are performed under laboratory conditions with a quasi-optical bench (Institute of Applied Physics, University of Bern). The icy analogs that we prepare in the Laboratory for Outflow Studies of Sublimating Materials (LOSSy, Physics Institute, University of Bern), include two different porous water ice samples composed of fine-grained ice particles with a size range of 4 to 6 microns and ice particles with a size range of 50 to 100 microns [4][5]; and possibly CO2 ice. We will present the general experimental set-up and the first results in the context to prepare the data interpretation of SWI.\n[1] Ulaby, F. T., Long, D. G., 2014.

            "abstract": "When a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous fluid, the contrast in viscosity destabilizes the interface between the two fluids, leading to the formation of fingers. Experimental and numerical studies of viscous fingering have focused on fluids that are either fully miscible (e.g. water and glycerol) or perfectly immiscible (e.g. water and oil). In practice, however, the miscibility of two fluids can change appreciably with temperature and pressure, and often falls into the case of partial miscibility, where two fluids have limited solubility in each other (e.g. CO2 and water).\nFollowing our recent work for miscible systems (Jha et al., PRL 2011, 2013) and immiscible systems (Cueto-Felgueroso and Juanes, PRL 2012, JFM 2014), here we propose a phase-field model for fluid-fluid displacements in a porous medium, when the two fluids have limited (but nonzero) solubility in one another. In our model, partial miscibility is characterized through the design of the thermodynamic free energy of the two-fluid system. We express the model in dimensionless form and elucidate the key dimensionless groups that control the behavior of the system. We present high-resolution numerical simulations of the model applied to the viscous fingering problem. On one hand, we demonstrate the effect of partial miscibility on the hydrodynamic instability. On the other, we elucidate the role of the degree of fingering on the rate of mutual fluid dissolution.\nFigure caption: final snapshots in simulations of viscous fingering with a two-fluid system mimicking that of CO2 and water. The colormap corresponds to the concentration of CO2. A band of less viscous gas phase rich in CO2 (red) displaces through the more viscous liquid phase that is undersaturated with CO2 (blue). At the fluid interface, an exchange of CO2 occurs as a result of local chemical potentials that drives the system towards thermodynamic equilibrium. This results in a shrinkage of gas phase as well as a local increase in CO2 concentration within the liquid phase (the white diffusive regions). The viscosity contrast R, defined here as the natural log of the viscosity ratio, increases from left to right.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological models are usually calibrated against observed discharge at the catchment outlet and thus are conditioned by an integral catchment information. This procedure ensures the fulfillment of the catchment's water balance but can lead to high predictive uncertainties in model internal states, like soil moisture, or a lack in spatial representativeness of the model. However, some hydrologic applications, as e.g. soil drought monitoring and prediction, rely on this information.\nWithin this study we propose a framework in which the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) is calibrated with soil moisture data from various sources. The aim is to condition the model on soil moisture (SM), while preserving good performance in discharge estimation. We identify the most appropriate objective functions by conducting synthetic experiments. The best objective function is determined based on i) deviation of synthetic and simulated soil moisture, ii) nonparametric comparison of SM fields (e.g copulas), and iii) by euclidian distance of model parameters. Those objective functions performing best are used to calibrate mHM against satellite soil moisture products (e.g. ESA-CCI, SMOS) and local in situ observations. This procedure is tested in 3 distinct European basins ranging from snow domination to semi arid climatic conditions.\nThe results of the synthetic experiment indicate that objective functions focusing on the temporal dynamics of SM are preferable to objective functions aiming on spatial patterns or catchment averages. The best performance in the sense of parameter distance is achieved using temporal correlation or the sum of squared distances from soil moisture anomalies of observed and estimated soil moisture. By comparing the copulas of the different objective functions no significant differences between the methods is observed. Employing satellite data, in a consecutive step, the calibrated model is able to catch soil moisture dynamics but deteriorates the discharge signal.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen budget of the Earth’s mantle is important in understanding how our planet evolves chemically over time. The Gakkel Ridge is the world’s slowest spreading ridge [1], and exposes peridotites along its axis that record the activity of oxygen in the upper mantle. Our samples comprise relatively fertile lherzolites and harzburgites (Cr#=0.13-0.17, 3.1-8.3% modal cpx [2]) as well as refractory harzburgites (Cr#=0.43-0.55, 0.2-1.0% modal cpx [2]). Using spinel peridotite oxygen barometry [3], we calculated the oxygen fugacity (fO2) of a suite of 10 peridotites from the Gakkel Ridge in order to investigate how melt processes affect the oxygen budget of the Earth’s interior.\nWe show that the low-Cr# lherzolites and harzburgites range from -0.1 to +0.6 log units relative to the QFM buffer, consistent with the global abyssal peridotite array, whereas high-Cr# refractory harzburgites have low fO2 values, ranging from -0.7 to -2.7 log units below QFM, with the most refractory samples falling significantly lower than the global array.\nBecause D’Errico et al. (submitted) interprets the refractory samples as recording ancient melt extraction, the low fO2 recorded by these samples may originate in the geologic past, perhaps even in a different tectonic setting. While LREE enrichment in the refractory harzburgites [2] provides evidence for refertilization by an infiltrating melt that could have recently imprinted reducing conditions, we see no corresponding increase in TiO2 content in the spinels, which weakens this hypothesis. Further research on additional refractory harzburgites is needed to constrain whether the reduced nature of these samples is telling us something about the effect of extreme melt extraction on fO2 at ridges, or whether these samples record a unique history that obscures processes operating at ridges today.\n[1] Coakley and Cochran, EPSL (1998), [2] D’Errico et al., submitted, [3] Bryndzia and Wood, American Journal of Science (1990)",

We investigated the drivers of trends in the mean annual cycle of atmospheric CO2 in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in simulations run until 2300. In these simulations, the amplitude of the mean annual cycle (averaged over the Northern Hemisphere) increases by 10% over the historical period and by 50% by 2100. Growing season productivity gains are responsible for most of the amplification, resulting in a strengthening global land carbon sink.\nWe separated the effects of CO2 radiative forcing (climate change) and fertilization by enhanced CO2 mole fractions by analyzing two separate simulations, one fully-coupled and one in which CO2 exerted no additional radiative forcing. Climate change and fertilization both increase the Northern Hemisphere CO2 annual cycle amplitude until the year 2300, with the largest amplitude gains occurring in the mid and high latitudes. CO2 fertilization drives the amplitude increase over the northern midlatitudes through 2300 and over the Arctic after 2100. Climate change is responsible for most of the amplitude increase over the Arctic before 2100. In contrast, climate change reduces the CO2 annual cycle amplitude over the tropics. While the mid latitude fertilization effect dominates the global CO2 amplitude response, the shift of the terrestrial biosphere to carbon source at the end of the 23rd century indicates that the tropical climate change drives the net terrestrial carbon flux.",

However, the thermal properties of near surface shelf sediments are poorly understood and this increases the uncertainty in determining the required cable current ratings, cable reliability and the potential effects on the sedimentary environments.\nWe present temperature measurements from a 2D laboratory experiment, designed to represent a buried, submarine HV cable. We used a large (2.5 m-high) tank, filled with water-saturated ballotini and instrumented with 120 thermocouples, which measured the time-dependent 2D temperature distributions around the heat source. The experiments use a buried heat source to represent a series of realistic cable surface temperatures with the aim for identifying the thermal regimes generated within typical non-cohesive shelf sediments: coarse silt, fine sand and very coarse sand. The steady state heat flow regimes, and normalised and radial temperature distributions were assessed. Our results show that at temperatures up to 60°C above ambient, the thermal regimes are conductive for the coarse silt sediments and convective for the very coarse sand sediments even at 7°C above ambient. However, the heat flow pattern through the fine sand sediment shows a transition from conductive to convective heat flow at a temperature of approximately 20°C above ambient. These findings offer an important new understanding of the thermal regimes associated with submarine HV cables buried in different substrates and has huge impacts on cable ratings as the IEC 60287 standard only considers conductive heat flow as well as other potential near surface impacts.",

            "abstract": "In many earth surface systems characteristic morphologies are associated with various regimes both past and present. Aeolian systems contain a variety of features differentiated largely by morphometric differences, which in turn reflect age and divergent process regimes. Using quantitative analysis of high-resolution elevation data to generate detailed information regarding these characteristic morphometries enables geomorphologists to effectively map process regimes from a distance. Combined with satellite imagery and other types of remotely sensed data, the outputs can even help to delineate phases of activity within aeolian systems. The differentiation of regimes and identification of relict features together enables a greater level of rigor to analyses leading to field-based investigations, which are highly dependent on site-specific historical contexts that often obscure distinctions between separate process-form regimes. We present results from a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) performed on a LiDAR-derived elevation model of a largely stabilized aeolian system in South Texas. The resulting components are layered and classified to generate a map of aeolian morphometric signatures for a portion of the landscape. Several of these areas do not immediately appear to be aeolian in nature in satellite imagery or LiDAR-derived models, yet field observations and historical imagery reveal the PCA did in fact identify stabilized and relict dune features. This methodology enables researchers to generate a morphometric classification of the land surface. We believe this method is a valuable and innovative tool for researchers identifying process regimes within a study area, particularly in field-based investigations that rely heavily on site-specific context.",

            "abstract": "In previous studies we derived new estimates for the magnitude of the components of the global, land and ocean mean energy balance (Wild et al. 2013 / 2015, Clim. Dyn. 40/44). Here we establish complementary estimates for the global mean energy fluxes under cloud free conditions. The energy fluxes in and out of the climate system under cloud free conditions at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) can be determinend with high accuracy from satellite-based measurements (CERES EBAF). For the estimation of the global mean clear-sky radiative fluxes at the Earth’s surface we follow the approach presented in Wild et al. (2013 / 2015), based on a combination of more than 40 state of the art global climate models from CMIP5 and their biases compared to a comprehensive set of high quality surface observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). Thereby the clear sky radiative flux biases in the various models are lineraly related to their respective global means. The associated clear sky reference climatologies at the BSRN sites have been composed based on Long and Ackermann (2000) and Hakuba et al. (2015). From the linear regression we inferred a best estimate (with zero bias against the surface observations) of 249 Wm-2 for the global mean insolation at the surface under cloud free conditions, and a corresponding surface absorption of 215 Wm-2, assuming a global mean surface albedo of 13.5%. Combined with a best estimate for the net influx of solar radiation at the TOA under cloud free skies from CERES-EBAF of 287 Wm-2, this leaves an amount of 72 Wm-2 absorbed solar radiation in the cloud free atmosphere. The 72 Wm-2coincide with our earlier estimate for this quantity in Wild et al. (2006, JGR) based on older models and much fewer direct observations, suggesting that this estimate is fairly robust. We intend to pursue a similar approach for the estimation of the thermal fluxes of the cloud-free global mean energy balance and aim at determining the global mean cloud effects by relating the all sky and clear sky global mean energy balances.\n",

They are characterized by shallow floors with a plate-like or convex appearance, wide floor moats, and radial, concentric, and polygonal floor-fractures. While the origin of these deformations has long been debated, it is now generally accepted that they are the result of the emplacement of shallow magmatic intrusions below their floor. These craters thus constitute an efficient tool to probe the importance of intrusive magmatism from the lunar surface. The most recent catalog of lunar-floor fractured craters references about 200 of them, mainly located around the lunar maria\nHerein, we will discuss the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to try to detect new floor-fractured craters on the Moon among the 60000 craters referenced in the most recent catalogs. In particular, we will use the gravity field provided by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, and the topographic dataset obtained from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) instrument to design a set of representative features for each crater. We will then discuss the possibility to design a binary supervised classifier, based on these features, to discriminate between the presence or absence of crater-centered intrusion below a specific crater. First predictions from different classifier in terms of their accuracy and uncertainty will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Soils are the main contributor of N2O emissions to the atmosphere, as documented by many measurements of N2O efflux at the soil surface. Different soil layers can act as sources or sinks for N2O, depending on N2O consumption and production by microorganisms, diffusion through the soil profile, and dissolution in soil water. Our research sought to identify and quantify sources or sinks of N2O in surface and deeper soils to improve our ability to predict fluxes of N2O from soils to the atmosphere.\nWe monitored the vertical profiles of soil N2O concentrations (0-160 cm depending on thickness) along two contrasting hillslopes (swale versus planar) and three landscape positions (ridgetop, midslope, and valley floor) in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) in central Pennsylvania. All landscape and hillslope positions had higher subsurface N2O concentrations (~800-3,000 ppbv) than soil surface concentrations (~320 ppbv), which were close to background atmospheric levels. Low soil-atmosphere fluxes measured in surface chambers suggested that much of the N2O produced at depth never reached the soil surface. Denitrification bioassays conducted on soil cores co-located with gas sampling positions revealed low potential rates of N2O consumption (<0.02 g m-2 yr-1), while dissolved N2O concentrations measured in the nearby stream were below ambient levels (<300 ppbv). These results suggest that the flux of N2O at the soil-atmosphere interface is low because diffusion limits transport from deeper soil layers. Models that link dynamic soil diffusivity with accumulations and depletions of N2O in the subsurface could improve our ability to predict surface-atmosphere N2O efflux.",

            "abstract": "Evaporation is a key process in land-climate interactions, not only because it directly regulates the hydrological cycle, but also because it contributes to the Earth’s energy balance. Due to its feedbacks on large-scale water processes and its impact on the dynamics of the atmosphere, it has been considered as a driver of droughts and heatwaves1-3. While evaporation from ocean surfaces is likely to increase with rising temperatures, it is unclear whether evapotranspiration from land surfaces could similarly increase, due to possible limitations imposed by soil moisture and vegetation physiology4.\nObservations suggest that groundwater (hereafter GW) has an important role in hydrological budgets and soil moisture variability in many regions, supplying moisture for evapotranspiration during dry seasons5, 6. Although modeling studies suggest that GW is often close enough to the surface to interact with the atmosphere7, 8, the soil water storage is often underestimated by land surface models. This is most likely due to neglecting the lateral movement of water from topographically higher altitudes to valley bottoms and its convergence close to the land surface, as well as the upward movement of water in the capillary fringe.\nThe focus of this study is to understand where and when GW may significantly enhance the availability of soil water for evapotranspiration. We also quantified the potential contribution of GW to evapotranspiration in the areas where GW is a major supply. We used the global network of eddy covariance observations9 (FLUXNET) along with global modeled GW depth10 and GLEAM ET model estimates11 to address the current gap in modelling ET due to neglecting GW supply.\nHaving identified areas where GW is tightly coupled with the atmosphere through evaporation processes, the study provides the basis to examine the “air conditioning effect” of GW and test the idea if GW enhances evaporation to the extent that leads to a cooler temperatures and wetter climates.",

            "abstract": "Meaningful interpretation of in-situ cosmogenic 10Be basin-wide erosion rates in slowly eroding postglacial catchments is complicated because 10Be is inherited through shifts between glacial and fluvial regimes and ice shielding prevents 10Be production. Such environments do not attain isotopic and landscape steady state, conditions necessary for the current method of calculating basin-wide erosion rates. We propose an alternate set of assumptions, specific to postglacial regions, which make it possible to calculate basin-wide erosion rates in the post-glacial Highlands of NW Scotland. From 20 Scottish basins basin-wide 10Be concentrations range from 2.129 x 104 to 4.870 x 104 atoms/g qtz. Average 10Be concentrations from shallow till and bank deposits within the basins are 2.856 x 104 atoms/g qtz, similar to the basin-wide concentrations, whereas average bedrock concentrations in the basins are 1.747 x 105 atoms/g qtz. This suggests that during the postglacial time most active sediment is derived from reworked deposits rather then sub-aerially eroded bedrock. Therefore, we make the simplifying assumption that most bedrock erosion occurs during glaciation. A deeply buried till that has experienced no nuclide production since deglaciation has a 10Be concentration of 6.810 x 103 atoms/g qtz and allows us to estimate how much of the 10Be in basin-wide samples was produced since deglaciation. A glacial ice thickness of only 2 m would shield all 10Be production; therefore we assume that no 10Be production occurred during glacial periods and that all production occurs during interglacial periods. Using 100 ka as the approximate duration of a Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycle, comprised of a 15 ka interglacial period and an 85 ka glacial period, and the aforementioned assumptions we have derived a numerical model to calculate basin-wide glacial erosion rates in NW Scotland.",

Feedback studies, in which the response is assumed to scale linearly with the perturbation, further require the ability to disentangle the responses that depend directly on the nature of the perturbation from those that scale linearly with forcing to obtain the so-called “effective radiative forcing” or ERF.\nThis talk will focus on uncertainties in estimates of present-day ERF, which has four sources: 1) errors in the fast radiation codes used to estimate the sensitivity of flux to changes in atmospheric composition on global scales; 2) uncertainty in historical distributions of temperature, humidity, and clouds; 3) uncertainty in “rapid adjustments”, i.e. the response of the climate system to particular changes in composition, and 4) uncertainty in the changes in composition themselves, primarily related to aerosols. I’ll describe the current state of understanding of each of these sources of uncertainty and explain sets of experiments to be undertaken as part of CMIP6 that will help refine the knowledge of ERF in nature as well as in the models participating in CMIP6. I’ll pay special attention to the forcing of atmospheric absorption, for which the uncertainty is especially large, and explain the implications for relationships between temperature and hydrologic sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Vesuvius is one the best studied and monitored volcanoes on Earth, but the populations which surround it have not benefited from the research that would produce their habitats resilient and sustainable to future eruptions. There is no official risk management strategy that would accomplish such goals and the best that the government and mass media have been able to do is to promote for the past 20 years an emergency evacuation plan of geologists. Such a plan is practically unreliable and culturally unacceptable. It requires the issuance of an evacuation order three weeks before an eruption and the relocation all over Italy of about one million people surrounding the volcano, without addressing the issues of mass exodus, resettlement of population, protection of the evacuated territory, and reentry. This strategy gives a license to territorial managers to postpone indefinitely any territorial intervention leading to resilience and sustainability and promotes desertification of the Vesuvius area. In 1995 an interdisciplinary research project called VESUVIUS 2000 (\nwww.gvess.org\n) was submitted to the European Union for a support, but it was rejected on the grounds that it interferes with the evacuation plan. This project aimed at producing by 2000 a feasibility plan of territorial interventions leading to the resilience and sustainability by requiring the accomplishment of five interdisciplinary goals (VESUVIUS PENTALOGUE) that would delineate the exclusion, resilience, and sustainability areas around the volcano. According to this risk reducing strategy, there is no need to produce the destruction of Vesuvius area culture and deal with the unreliability of long-term eruption prediction. It allows the population to prepare for an eruption and aims at producing a resilient and prosperous territory. It is unfortunate for the populations surrounding Vesuvius, and for the natural hazards research in particular, that the path towards resilience and sustainability is being obstructed by the narrow-mindedness and special interests which nurture themselves on this misfortune.",

            "abstract": "Asymmetry or symmetry of magma-poor rifted margins refers commonly to the crustal architecture and the occurrence or absence of large-scale in-sequence extensional detachment faults. While hyper-extended domains at magma-poor rifted margins are often considered to be asymmetric, the downlapping sedimentary sequences observed over Ocean Continent Transitions (OCT) at conjugate pairs of margins suggest a symmetric evolution for these domains prior to lithospheric breakup. In this context, it appears that the current models implying a single detachment fault to explain the presence of exhumed serpentinized mantle domains cannot account for the observations made OCT.\nOn the base of small-scale structural and stratigraphic observations along the Australia-Antarctica and Iberia-Newfoundland margins we propose that this final large-scale symmetric architecture of the OCT can be related to the development of multiple, out-of-sequence asymmetric detachment faults. Detailed mapping of these faults suggests that they are related to a cyclic de- and re-localization of deformation resulting in an apparent symmetric pattern. These cycles of deformation appear to be strongly influenced by magmatic increase and by alternations between pure shear and simple shear modes. In this context, the presence of a decoupling interface between the upper brittle deformation in the serpentinized exhumed mantle and underlying levels is of major importance. The complex interaction between out-of-sequence detachment systems and the successive rise of the asthenosphere may explain the observed transition from a fault- to a magma-controlled strain accommodation and the transition to more symmetric and localized accretion associated with the formation of a stable spreading center.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic braiding is one of the leading theories for heating the magnetically closed corona, however, understanding of the central processes has changed dramatically in recent years. In particular, it is now recognized that braided fields allow impulsive heating via the formation of large numbers of turbulently forming and evolving reconnection regions, which are volume filling and inherently 3D, and it is no longer necessary to invoke topological discontinuities to dissipate stored energy. It has also become clear that turbulent reconnection produces structures that are inconsistent with a Taylor relaxation model, raising questions about how much stored energy is available for heating and particle acceleration. Here, we look at recent progress that has been made in dealing with this complex heating mechanism and present a new advance that greatly improves estimates of the magnetic energy available for heating and particle acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Shallow magmatic intrusions make room for themselves by upward bending of the elastic overburden. Previous studies have shown that the bending of the overlying layer first controls the dynamics. Then, when the radius reaches a few times the flexural wavelength of the overburden, it transitions to a gravity current regime. This model predicts the appropriate geometry for both terrestrial laccoliths and large mafic sills. However, it underestimates the absolute dimensions of these magmatic intrusions; in particular, it requires abnormally high viscosity to reconcile both observations and predictions.\nTo get some insights into the effective flow viscosity, we develop a model that account for the cooling of such elastic-plated gravity currents. We show that the coupling between the temperature field and the flow itself leads to the formation of a highly viscous region at the tip that slows down the spreading in both regimes. The intrusions are predicted to be thicker and their dimensions, especially in the bending regime, are now consistent with observations.\nBy introducing the potentially complex structure of the overburden, we also show that the topography largely contributes to constrain the final intrusion morphology. For instance, in the case of an intrusion centered below a circular depression, the model predicts that the lithostatic increase at the crater rim prevents the magma from spreading laterally and enhances the thickening of the intrusion. This model has already proven successful in reproducing the deformations observed on potential intrusion centered below lunar impact craters.\nCaldera complexes often exhibit ground deformations that might be associated to the formation of shallow magmatic intrusions. InSAR imaging and GPS measurements now provide efficient tools to monitor these deformations. We conclude this study by examining the ability of the model to reproduce the deformation observed in several caldera complexes.",

            "abstract": "Our effort to make the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP) data, acquired from 1969 to 1977, readily available to current and future researchers, as reported in this session last year, has made us realize some potentially serious problems that may be common to legacy scientific data. One such problem was the loss of key information contained in the original data. This happened (a) when the original investigators thought it was enough to archive only the data of interest to contemporary researchers; (b) when the data were reformatted to make them readily decipherable to current researchers by someone who did not fully understand the details of the data, thus introducing incorrectly translated information; (c) when errors associated with reading of the original data were not corrected; and (d) simply due to a programming error in reformatting. The only sure way to avoid such a problem is to archive the raw experimental data in addition to the processed data, even though they may not be readily decipherable to most current researchers. For such raw data to be useful, it is also important that complete metadata necessary to interpret the raw data be preserved.",

These strata occur along a 250km transect in Minnesota and Iowa. They represent deposition in a tectonically stable, marginal marine setting that records the interplay of (1) seafloor topography, (2) sea level change, (3) terrigenous influx that periodically smothered a benthic heterozoan faunal community, and (4) production of micritic carbonate that eludes assignment to obvious depositional conditions. Preliminary analyses of δ13Ccarb data from closely spaced sections of the Platteville Formation reveal km-scale lateral variation in the isotopic record. Amid current debate over the interpretation of isotopically distinct “aquafacies” in epeiric seas (reported in these and similar strata elsewhere), our data appear to distinguish regional lithofacies and allow correlation through an otherwise sedimentologically-opaque carbonate rock. Comparison of δ13Ccarb with δ13Corg from carbonate and shale units through the Platteville, Decorah and Cummingsville Formations permits time correlation across significant facies and paleoceanographic gradients in the study area. High-resolution lithostratigraphic data from pXRF allows comparison with this isotopic chronostratigraphy. This time interval includes cooling at the onset of global ice-house conditions (under relatively elevated atmospheric CO2 levels), perturbations of the carbon cycle evinced by δ13C excursions (e.g., GICE) and unusual marine ashfalls preserved as well known K-bentonites in the study area (Millbrig, Deicke, etc.). These strata provide an opportunity to study the dynamics of the most inshore and possibly most sensitive setting preserved for this system.",

These projects included almost 100 hours of sampling exhaust emissions from the NASA DC-8 aircraft in both ground and airborne operation and at idle to takeoff thrust settings. Tested fuels included Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthetic kerosenes manufactured from coal and natural-gas feedstocks; Hydro-treated Esters and Fatty-Acids (HEFA) fuels made from beef-tallow and camelina-plant oil; and 50:50 blends of these alternative fuels with Jet A. Experiments were also conducted with FT and Jet A fuels doped with tetrahydrothiophene to examine the effects of fuel sulfur on volatile aerosol and contrail formation and microphysical properties. Results indicate that although the absence of aromatic compounds in the alternative fuels caused DC-8 fuel-system leaks, the fuels did not compromise engine performance or combustion efficiency. And whereas the alternative fuels produced only slightly different gas-phase emissions, dramatic reductions in non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) emissions were observed when burning the pure alternative fuels, particularly at low thrust settings where particle number and mass emissions were an order of magnitude lower than measured from standard jet fuel combustion; 50:50 blends of Jet A and alternative fuels typically reduced nvPM emissions by ~50% across all thrust settings. Alternative fuels with the highest hydrogen content produced the greatest nvPM reductions. For Jet A and fuel blends, nvPM emissions were positively correlated with fuel aromatic and naphthalene content. Fuel sulfur content regulated nucleation mode aerosol number and mass concentrations within aging exhaust plumes, but did not clearly impact contrail formation or microphysics.",

Newly described detailed chemical mechanisms are able to describe the newly measured BVOC oxidation products, bringing measurements and model closer together. At the same time, new measurement strategies have surmounted recently discovered interferences in some instruments that measure hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl and the measured hydroxyl now appears to be in much better agreement with the model values. While some of this progress has been made by making measurements in the forests, much of it has been made with studies in laboratories and environmental chambers. In this presentation, we report on the measurements of hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl, and OH reactivity that were made during the FIXCIT campaign in the CalTech environmental chamber in January 2014. These measurements will be compared to other methods of determining these species and to model results. In addition, we will present observations of the behavior of the OH interference signal observed by our instrument and will speculate on its possible cause.",

            "abstract": "We present a geophysical and petrological study that aims to define the lithosphere structure and the variations of the chemical composition of the lithospheric mantle along three geo-transects crossing Iberia, the westernmost Mediterranean and North Africa. The modeling is based on an integrated geophysical-petrological methodology that combines elevation, gravity, geoid, surface heat flow, seismic and geochemical data. Unlike previous models, where the density of the lithospheric mantle is only temperature-dependent, the applied methodology allows inferring seismic velocities and density in the mantle down to 400 km depth from its chemical composition through self-consistent thermodynamic calculations. The first geo-transect with a length of 1100 km runs from the NE-Iberian Peninsula to the Tell–Atlas Mountains in Algeria. The second profile crosses the entire Iberian Peninsula, from the Northern Iberian Margin to the Alboran Basin. The third runs from the Iberian Massif to the Sahara Platform crossing the Betic-Rif orogenic system through the Gibraltar Strait and the Atlas Mountains. Results are compared to available tomography models and Pn-velocity data. The obtained lithospheric structure shows large lateral variations in crustal and lithospheric mantle thicknesses and mantle chemical composition. Measured low Pn velocities in the Western Mediterranean basin can be explained either by serpentinization and/or seismic anisotropy and only partly by transient thermal effects.

            "abstract": "The human presence close to streams and rivers is known to have consistently increased worldwide, therefore introducing dramatic anthropogenic and environmental changes. However, a spatio-temporal detailed analysis is missing to date. In this analysis, we propose a novel method to quantify the temporal evolution and the spatial distribution of the anthropogenic presence along streams and rivers and in their immediate proximity at the global scale and at a high spatial resolution (i.e., nearly 1 km at the equator). We use satellite images of nocturnal lights, available as yearly snapshots from 1992 to 2013, and identify five distinct distance classes from the river network position. Our results show a temporal enhancement of human presence across the considered distance classes. In particular, we observed a higher human concentration in the vicinity of the river network, even though the frequency distribution of human beings in space has not significantly changed in the last two decades. Our results prove that fine scale remotely sensed data, as nightlights, may provide new perspectives in water science, improving our understanding of the human impact on water resources and water-related environments.",

            "abstract": "Large scale mapping of evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture is only possible when satellite images are used. The spatial resolution of this imagery typically depends on its temporal resolution or the satellite overpass time. For example, the Landsat satellite acquires images at 30 m resolution every 16 days while the MODIS satellite acquires images at 250 m resolution every day. In this study we deal with optical/thermal imagery that is impacted by cloudiness contrary to radar imagery that penetrates through clouds. Due to cloudiness, the temporal resolution of Landsat drops from 16 days to about one clear sky Landsat image per month in the southwestern USA and about one every ten years in the humid tropics of Panama. Only by launching additional satellites can the temporal resolution be improved. Since this is too costly, an alternative is found by using ground measurements with high temporal resolution (from minutes to days) but poor spatial resolution. The challenge for large-scale evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture mapping is to construct a layer stack consisting of N time layers covering the period of interest each containing M pixels covering the region of interest. We will present examples of the Phoenix Active Management Area in AZ (14,600 km2), Green River Basin in WY (44,000 km2), the Kishwaukee Watershed in IL (3,150 km2), the area covered by Landsat Path 28/Row 35 in OK (30,000 km2) and the Agua Salud Watershed in Panama (200 km2). In these regions we used Landsat or MODIS imagery for mapping evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture by the algorithm Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) together with meteorological measurements and sometimes either Large Aperture Scintillometers (LAS) or Eddy Covariance (EC). We conclude with lessons learned for future large-scale hydrological studies.",

            "abstract": "Continental Africa has the largest volume of water stored in wetlands, large lakes, reservoirs and rivers, yet it suffers with problems such as water availability and access. Furthermore, African countries are amongst the most vulnerable to the impact of natural hazards such as droughts and floods. With climate change intensifying the hydrologic cycle and altering the distribution and frequency of rainfall, the problem of water availability and access is bound to increase. The U.S Geological Survey Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, has initiated a large-scale project to monitor small to medium surface water bodies in Africa. Under this project, multi-source satellite data and hydrologic modeling techniques are integrated to monitor these water bodies in Africa. First, small water bodies are mapped using satellite data such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat, and high resolution Google Earth imagery. Stream networks and watersheds for each water body are identified using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data. Finally, a hydrologic modeling approach that uses satellite-derived precipitation estimates and evapotranspiration data calculated from global data assimilation system climate parameters is applied to model water levels. This approach has been implemented to monitor nearly 300 small water bodies located in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Validation of modeled scaled depths with field-installed gauge data in East Africa demonstrated the ability of the model to capture both the spatial patterns and seasonal variations. Modeled scaled estimates captured up to 60% of the observed gauge variability with an average RMSE of 22%. Current and historic data (since 2001) on relative water level, precipitation, and evapotranspiration for each water body is made available in near real time. The water point monitoring network will be further expanded to cover other pastoral regions of sub-Saharan Africa. This project provides timely information on water availability that supports FEWS NET monitoring activities in Africa. Information on water availability produced in this study would further increase the resilience of local communities to floods and droughts.",

            "abstract": "The winter albedo of boreal evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) has been poorly simulated in climate models, with a reported range among CMIP5 models exceeding 0.25 in April, and a strong positive bias in areas with high canopy cover. Such errors have been attributed to unrealistic representation of leaf area index, snow interception and unloading, and are associated with biases in the simulated snow albedo feedback. The Canadian Atmospheric Global Climate Model has been shown to underestimate the winter albedo in boreal ENF. We present changes to the parameterization of the albedo of ENF with intercepted snow; a new relationship between interception and the fractional coverage of the canopy by snow (fsnow); and unloading based on weather conditions. The new algorithms are employed in version 3.6 of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) in off-line mode and the simulated daily albedo compared with observations at four ENF sites.\nDefault values for the visible and near-infrared albedo of snow-covered canopy were increased from 0.17 and 0.23, respectively, to 0.27 and 0.38. fsnow increased too slowly with interception, producing a damped albedo response. A new model for fsnow is based on zI* = 3 cm, the effective depth of newly intercepted snow required to raise the canopy albedo to its maximum (corresponding to fsnow = 1). Snow unloading rates were derived from visual assessments of photographs and modeled based on relationships with meteorological variables. A model based on wind speed at the canopy top produced the best result, replacing the time-based method employed in CLASS. Model configurations were assessed based on the index of agreement, d, and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The mean d and RMSE over four sites were 0.58 and 0.058 for the default configuration of CLASS 3.6, and 0.86 and 0.038 for the best model configuration.",

            "abstract": "The Van Allen Probes satellites launched by NASA in 2012 are currently orbiting in Earth’s radiation belts collecting data about electromagnetic waves and charged particles in the near-earth space environment. Whistler-mode waves are naturally occurring right-hand polarized, very-low frequency waves (< 30 kHz), that can efficiently interact with the energetic electrons in the earth’s radiation belts magnetosphere and remediate them from the magnetosphere by precipitating these particles into the atmosphere. The important property of the whistler-mode waves is that they can be guided by density inhomogeneities extended along the ambient magnetic field and localized in the direction perpendicular to the field. Such density channels can be formed by the density enhancement or depletion and they are called ducts. The primary goal of our research is to find density duct and whistler waves in the data recorded by the Van Allen Probes satellites in the magnetosphere, and to reproduce these data with numerical simulations of time-dependent, two-dimensional electron MHD model. In this paper, we present results from our analysis of the observations performed by the Van Allen Probes satellites on 15 October 2014. Data from the probes show the electric and magnetic fields and plasma density. In this event whistler-mode waves were observed from 01:42 to 01:54 UT inside the localized density enhancement coincided with the flux of energetic electrons. Short time intervals, high concentrated electron density, and electron flux gradient activity make this event very interesting for the investigation. Numerical simulations of the electron MHD model revels reasonable quantitative agreement between numerical results and satellite observations, suggesting that the electromagnetic disturbances recorded by the Van Allen Probes satellites, are the whistler-mode waves indeed.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremors have been considered to be a swarm or superimposed pulses of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs). To systematically analyze the high-speed migration of tremor [e.g., Shelly et al., 2007], we here focus on an intensive cluster hosting many low-frequency earthquakes located at the western part of Shikoku Island. We relocated ~770 hypocenters of LFEs identified by the JMA, which took place from Jan. 2008 to Dec. 2013, applying double differential relocation algorithm [e.g., Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000] to arrival times picked by the JMA and those obtained by waveform cross correlation measurements. The epicentral distributions show a clear alignment parallel to the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate, as like a slip-parallel streaking. Then, we applied a matched-filter technique to continuous seismograms recorded near the source region using relocated template LFEs during 6 years (between Jan. 2008 and Dec. 2013).\nWe newly detected about 60 times the number of template events, which is fairly larger than ones obtained by conventional envelope cross correlation method. Interestingly, we identified many repeated sequences of tremor migrations along the slip-parallel streaking (~350 sequences). Front of each or stacked migration of tremors can be modeled by a parabolic envelope, indicating a diffusion process. The diffusivity of parabolic envelope is estimated to be around 105 m2/s, which is categorized as high-speed migration feature (~100 km/hour). Most of the rapid migrations took place during occurrences of short-term slow slip events (SSEs), and seems to be triggered by ocean and solid Earth tides.\nThe most plausible explanation of the high-speed propagation is a diffusion process of stress pulse concentrated within a cluster of strong brittle patches on the ductile shear zone [Ando et al., 2012]. The viscosity of the ductile shear zone within the streaking is at least one order magnitude smaller than that of the slow-speed migration. This discrepancy of viscosity indicates that the streaking has different rheology compared with background main tremor/SSE belt. In addition, the diffusivity did not show any significant change before and after the Tohoku-Oki M9.0 Earthquake, suggesting that the high-speed propagation of tremors seems to be stable against external stress perturbations.",

A 16-member ensemble of eight snow models (SM) simulations, based on the high-resolution Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM-15km) simulations driven by two realizations of the Canadian Global Climate Model (CGCM3), is established per catchment.\nThis study aims to compare a range of SMs in their ability at simulating snow processes under current climate, and to evaluate how they affect the assessment of the climate change-induced snow impacts at the catchment scale. The variability of snow processes caused by the use of two SM approaches (degree-day versus mixed degree-day/energy balance) is evaluated, as well as the uncertainty of natural climate variability (CRCM inter-member variability). The simulations in the virtual world cover 1961-1990 in the present period and 2041-2060 in the future period. This virtual world offers a high-resolution coherent dataset with no missing data or inconsistencies in time and in space. The virtual world experiments were compared to the same experiments over a short validation in the real world.\nThe results show that, when comparing to snow water equivalent (SWE) from the virtual world, all SMs perform similarly at modeling SWE for the reference and future periods. These findings can be extended to the real world, where the SMs lead to a high level of agreement with the observations in reproducing catchment scale snow hydrology.\nThe results of various snow indicators show that most of the uncertainty arises from natural climate variability followed by the SM. The uncertainty linked to the choice of a SM is larger than that associated with the choice of the SM approach in quantifying the snow hydrology impacts. Overall, the SMs provide a low degree of uncertainty to the total uncertainty in hydrologic modeling for climate change impact studies.\nKeywords: CRCM; virtual world; snow water modeling; uncertainty; Canada.",

Experimental studies have reported stark differences in iron partitioning between bridgmanite (Brg) and ferropericlase (Fp) for San Carlos olivine [1] and pyrolite [2] systems. We recently performed experiments at lower mantle conditions for an Al-rich olivine system [3] and observed an iron enrichment of the silicate phase very similar to that in pyrolite. Mössbauer studies [4] have shown that in the presence of aluminum non negligible amounts of Fe3+ could be incorporated in bridgmanite explaining the observed iron enrichment.\nNon negligible amounts of Fe3+ in the lower mantle could influence transport properties of the phases [5]. The evaluation of ferrous and ferric iron concentrations in lower mantle mineral assemblages is then key to a thorough understanding of geophysical observations and associated mantle dynamics.\nWe used electron energy loss spectroscopy technique to quantify the proportions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ iron in Brg and Fp phases previously synthesized from Al-rich olivine composition [3]. The oxidation state of iron in the lower mantle will be discussed as well as ensuing implications on transport properties for relevant lower mantle compositions.\n",

Integration of this scaling relationship predicts a relationship between channel length and downstream integrated drainage area, referred to in recent studies as χ (Willett et al., 2014). In this paper, we apply this methodology at a continental scale by calculating χ for the world’s river networks using hydrological information from the HydroSHED (Hydrological data and maps based on SHuttleElevation Derivatives at multiple Scales) suite of geo-referenced data sets (drainage directions and flow accumulations). River pixels were identified using a minimum drainage area of 5 km2. A constant value of m/n of 0.45 was assumed. We applied a new method to correct χ within closed basins where base level is different from sea level.\nMapping of χ illustrates the geometric stability of a river network, thus highlighting where tectonic or climatic forcing has perturbed the shape and geometry. Each continent shows characteristic features. Continental rift margins on all continents show clear asymmetric escarpments indicating inland migration. Active orogenic belts break up older river basins, but are difficult to interpret because of spatially variable uplift rates. Regions of recent tilting are evident even in cratonic areas by lateral reorganizations of basins. Past and pending river captures are identified on all continents. Very few regions on Earth appear to be in near-equilibrium, though some are identified; for example the Urals appears to provide a stable continental divide for Eurasia. Our analysis of maps of χ at the global scale quantifies a dynamic view of Earth's river networks and helps to identify past and ongoing evolution of Earth's landscapes.\n",

The precipitation deficits during many Southwest Asia droughts have been examined in terms of the forcing by climate variability originating over the Pacific Ocean as a result of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) and the long-term warming of Pacific (LT) sea surface temperatures (SST). Here, we 1) examine how the most extreme November-April Southwest Asia droughts relate to global SSTs and the associated large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies, 2) analyze the specific atmospheric forcing mechanisms responsible for changes in regional Southwest Asian precipitation and 3) examine the causal mechanisms responsible for the increased frequency of Southwest Asia drought in recent decades.\nThe driest November-April seasons during 1948-2012 over Southwest Asia are forced by subsidence and reductions of moisture fluxes as a result of the interaction of the mean flow with anomalous zonally-symmetric high pressure throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The anomalous zonally-symmetric high pressure throughout the Northern Hemisphere occurs simultaneously with cool central and eastern Pacific SST anomalies associated with La Niña and the negative phase of PDV and a warm west Pacific Ocean caused in part by the long-term warming of the west Pacific Ocean. The long-term warming of the Pacific Ocean has driven the regional precipitation declines in recent decades, with the strongest signal occurring over areas bordering the Arabian Sea.",

            "abstract": "Recent estimates of bioenergy induced land use land cover change (LULCC) have large uncertainty due to misclassification errors in the LULC datasets used for analysis. These uncertainties are further compounded when data is modified by merging classes, aggregating pixels and change in classification methods over time. Hence the LULCC computed using these derived datasets is more a reflection of change in classification methods, change in input data and data manipulation rather than reflecting actual changes ion ground. Furthermore results are constrained by geographic extent, update frequency and resolution of the dataset. To overcome this limitation we have developed a change detection system to identify yearly as well as seasonal changes in LULC patterns. Our method uses hierarchical clustering which works by grouping objects into a hierarchy based on phenological similarity of different vegetation types. The algorithm explicitly models vegetation phenology to reduce spurious changes. We apply our technique on globally available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data at 250-meter resolution. We analyze 10 years of bi-weekly data to predict changes in the mid-western US as a case study. The results of our analysis are presented and its advantages over existing techniques are discussed.",

Cubesats started the “smallsat” trend back in the late 1990’s early 2000’s, with the first Cubesats launching in 2003. NASA anticipates a number of future benefits from small satellite missions, including lower costs, more rapid development, higher risk tolerance, and lower barriers to entry for universities and small businesses. The Agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate is currently addressing technology gaps in small satellite platforms, while the Science Mission Directorate pursues miniaturization of science instruments. Launch opportunities are managed through the Cubesat Launch Initiative, and the Agency manages these projects as sub-orbital payloads with little program overhead.\nIn this session we bring together scientists and technologists to discuss the current state of the smallsat field. We explore ideas for new investments, new instruments, or new applications that NASA should be investing in to expand the utility of smallsats. We discuss the status of a NASA-directed NRC study on the utility of small satellites. Looking to the future, what does NASA need to invest in now, to enable high impact (“decadal survey” level) science with smallsats? How do we push the envelope?

            "abstract": "Groundwater and surface water are interconnected and can be considered a single water resource, and thus it is important to understand groundwater contributions to streamflow, or baseflow, within a region. Previously, quantification of baseflow using chemical mass balance at large numbers of sites was not possible because of data limitations. However, a new method using regression-derived daily specific conductance values with conductivity mass balance hydrograph separation allows for baseflow estimation at sites across large regions. This method was applied to estimate baseflow discharge at 229 sites across the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). Subsequently, relationships between baseflow discharge and climate, soil, topography, and land cover characteristics were evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA). Results indicate that approximately half of the streamflow in the UCRB is baseflow derived from groundwater discharge to streams. Higher baseflow yields typically occurred in upper elevation areas of the UCRB, and PCA identified precipitation, snow, sand content of soils, land surface slope, percent grasslands, and percent natural barren lands as being positively correlated with baseflow yield. Temperature, potential evapotranspiration, silt and clay content of soils, percent agriculture, and percent shrublands were negatively correlated with baseflow yield. These findings indicate that baseflow contributes a significant fraction of total streamflow in the UCRB and provide insights into watershed characteristics that may affect baseflow volume. Results demonstrate the interconnected nature of groundwater and surface water and highlight the importance of managing them as a single water resource.",

            "abstract": "I present models of lithosphere density and the non-thermal part of upper mantle Vs anomalies in different tectonic provinces of Eurasia and North America. The focus is on compositional heterogeneity of the lithospheric mantle, and therefore the effect of regional temperature variations on density and Vs is removed by applying regional temperature corrections, which are constrained by heat flow data.\nSignificant parts of Precambrian cratons of Laurasia are characterized by extremely low surface heat flow values (<25-30 mW/m2), which imply the depth extent of the lithospheric keels down to 300-350 km, at least locally. These values are in apparent contradiction with a worldwide compilation of cratonic xenolith P-T arrays, which are usually consistent with surface heat flow of around 40 mW/m2 and the lithosphere thickness of 200-250 km depth. Models of lithosphere density and seismic velocity structure indicate that xenoliths do not sample mantle with the lowest density and the highest velocity.\nDensity structure of continental lithosphere mantle correlates with crustal structure and surface tectonics. This observation is illustrated by examples from the East European and the Siberian cratons, where lateral variations in density structure of the lithospheric mantle are compared with petrological studies of mantle-derived xenoliths from the Fennoscandian and Siberian kimberlite provinces. The results indicate that in the Siberian craton isopycnicity is satisfied only in major kimberlite provinces. High lithosphere density in major sedimentary basins suggests the presence of eclogitic material.\nSince the depth distribution of density anomalies is unknown, the analysis is complemented by seismic data in order to understand better geodynamic causes of mantle density heterogeneity. Temperature-corrected seismic velocity structure based on published high-resolution tomography models indicates a pronounced stratification of lithospheric mantle in many Precambrian terranes, in agreement with xenolith data. The lateral extent of depleted lithospheric keels diminishes with depth and, below a 150-200 km depth, may be significantly smaller than geological boundaries of the cratons.",

Despite their important microphysical effects, studies of aerosol-convection interactions often focus on the sensitivity of an idealised model with a single microphysics representation to perturbations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC). However, this approach assumes a reliable representation of microphysical pathways.\nIn this study we investigate the robustness of simulated aerosol effects on convection across different microphysics representations. High-resolution convection-permitting simulations are performed using the WRF model in three configurations. For each case we compare two frequently used double-moment bulk microphysics schemes and investigate the cloud system response to CDNC perturbations.\nMicrophysics representation dominates over response to CDNC in driving differences in the simulated cloud morphology and precipitation. Moreover, cloud and precipitation responses to CDNC are found not to be robust either between schemes or between cases. In a warm-rain case, autoconversion is shown to be the dominant pathway behind cloud and precipitation differences, but other pathways dominate in other regimes.\nThese results have significant implications for future modelling studies of aerosol-convection interactions.",

DddP is a DMSP lyase in marine bacteria and the deduced dddP gene product is abundant in marine metagenomic data sets. However, DddP belongs to the M24 peptidase family according to sequence alignment. Peptidases hydrolyze C-N bonds but DddP is deduced to cleave C-S bonds. Mechanisms responsible for this striking functional shift are currently unknown. We determined the structures of DMSP lyase RlDddP (the DddP from Ruegeria lacuscaerulensis ITI_1157) bound to inhibitory 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid or PO43- and of two mutants of RlDddP bound to acrylate. Based on structural, mutational and biochemical analyses, we characterized a new ion-shift catalytic mechanism of RlDddP for DMSP cleavage. Further, we suggested the structural mechanism leading to the loss of peptidase activity and the subsequent development of DMSP lyase activity in DddP. This study sheds light on the catalytic mechanism and the divergent evolution of DddP, leading to a better understanding of marine bacterial DMSP catabolism and global DMS production.",

            "abstract": "To predict rates of river sediment transport, one must first address the zeroth-order question: when does sediment move? The concept and determination of the critical fluid shear stress remains hazy, as observing particle motion and determining sediment flux becomes increasingly hard in its vicinity. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel annular flume experiment - reproducing an infinite river channel - where the refractive index of particles and the fluid are matched. The fluid is dyed with a fluorescent powder and a green laser sheet illuminates the fluid only, allowing us to observe particle displacements in a vertical plane. Experiments are designed to highlight the basic granular interactions of sediment transport while suppressing the complicating effects of turbulence; accordingly, particles are uniform spheres and Reynolds numbers are of order 1. We have performed sediment transport measurements close to the onset of particle motion, at steady state, and over long enough time to record averaged rheological behavior of particles. We find that particles entrained by a fluid exhibit successively from top to bottom: a suspension regime, a dense granular flow regime, and - instead of a static bed - a creeping regime. Data from experiments at a range of fluid stresses can be collapsed onto one universal rheologic curve that indicates the effective friction is a monotonic function of a dimensionless number called the viscous number. These data are in remarkable agreement with the local rheology model proposed by Boyer et al., which means that dense granular flows, suspensions and bed-load transport are unified under a common frictional flow law. Importantly, we observe slow creeping of the granular bed even in the absence of bed load, at fluid stresses that are below the apparent critical value. This last observation challenges the classical definition of the onset of sediment transport, and points to a continuous transition from quasi-static deformation to granular flow. These results provide a new perspective to connect the transport laws for soil creep, landslides/debris flows and river transport. Although our experiments are highly idealized, evidence from other studies suggest that our observations may be directly relevant to natural systems. Finally we show that our findings are robust for mixed grain sizes.",

Here, we reconstruct the early Holocene ice margin history of the Søndre Isortoq region of western Greenland to evaluate the response of the GrIS to Holocene climate change. The moraines in this region are part of an extensive moraine system known as the Fjord Stade moraines, which have been nearly continuously traced throughout western Greenland. These moraines have been directly dated to 9.2 and 8.2 ka in the Disko Bugt region, suggesting that they represent a readvance or stillstand of the GrIS in response to the 9.3 and 8.2 ka abrupt cooling events, respectively. However, because the Fjord Stade moraines have not been directly and precisely dated elsewhere, it is unclear whether the entire western GrIS margin responded to these events or not. To address this issue, we selected boulders from two sites in the Søndre Isortoq region for cosmogenic 10Be exposure dating. In Nunatarssuaq, we sampled eight erratic boulders perched on bedrock beyond and inside of the Fjord Stade moraines. Samples from Qátqatsiaq include nine Fjord Stade moraine boulders and seven erratic boulders that bracket the moraines. We found that the Fjord Stade moraines in the Søndre Isortoq region were abandoned at ~9 ka and that they may be correlated with the outer Fjord Stade moraines in Disko Bugt. If the western GrIS margin did respond to the 9.3 ka cooling event, the later age of ~9 ka at Søndre Isortoq could suggest that land-terminating sectors of the GrIS are less sensitive to centennial-scale climate change than their marine-terminating counterparts. In addition, exposure ages for moraine boulders and boulders inside the moraines are indistinguishable within dating uncertainties, indicating that once initiated, retreat from the Fjord Stade moraines occurred rapidly.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic frequency analysis is commonly used by engineers and hydrologists to provide the basic information on planning, design and management of hydraulic structures and water resources system under the assumption of stationarity. However, with increasing evidence of changing climate, it is possible that the assumption of stationarity would no longer be valid and the results of conventional analysis would become questionable. In this study, we consider a framework for frequency analysis of extreme flows based on B-Splines quantile regression, which allows to model non-stationary data that have a dependence on covariates. Such covariates may have linear or nonlinear dependence. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to estimate quantiles and their posterior distributions. A coefficient of determination for quantiles regression is proposed to evaluate the estimation of the proposed model for each quantile level. The method is applied on annual maximum and minimum streamflow records in Ontario, Canada. Climate indices are considered to describe the non-stationarity in these variables and to estimate the quantiles in this case. The results show large differences between the non-stationary quantiles and their stationary equivalents for annual maximum and minimum discharge with high annual non-exceedance probabilities.\nKeywords: Quantile regression, B-Splines functions, MCMC, Streamflow, Climate indices, non-stationarity.",

            "abstract": "Dissolution of CO2 in formation brines is likely to be a major process which stabilises stored CO2 on longer time scales and mitigates CO2 migrating through storage complexes. However very little is known about the likely rates of CO2 dissolution as CO2 flows through natural heterogeneous brine filled reservoirs. Here we report the results of sampling fluids over 6 months after a phase of CO2 injection commenced for enhanced oil recovery coupled with injection of isotopically enriched 3He and 129Xe. Modelling of the changes in fluid chemistry has previously been interpreted to indicate significant dissolution of silicate minerals where fluids remained close to saturation with calcite. These calculations, which are based on modal decomposition of changes in cation concentrations, are supported by changes in the isotopic compositions of Sr, Li and Mg. Analysis of Sr-isotopic compositions of samples from outcrops of the Frontier Formation, which forms the reservoir sampled by the EOR experiment, reveals substantial heterogeneity. Silicate mineral compositions have 87Sr/86Sr ratios between 0.709 and 0.719 whereas carbonate cements have values around 0.7076. Calculation of CO2 dissolution based on simplified 2-D flow models shows that fluids likely sample reservoir heterogeneities present on a finer scale with CO2 fingers occupying the most permeable horizons and most water flow in the adjacent slightly less permeable zones. Smaller time scale variations in 87Sr/86Sr ratios are interpreted to reflect variations in flow paths on small length scales driven by invading CO2.",

            "abstract": "Recent evidence from the IPCC and National Climate Assessment reports indicate that extreme climate events are increasing in many regions of the world. Interestingly, the nature and causes of the changes in extremes may be expressed differently for the global and regional scales, and also amongst climate variables (e.g., precipitation and temperature). For instance, over the last several decades the temperature probability density function on the global scale exhibits a mean shift to the warmer side, as opposed to a change in it’s variability. Conversely, the interannual variability of precipitation is intensifying on the regional scale, especially over the U.S. during spring. Although the statistical characteristics of the temperature and precipitation changes may have a varied expression they both contribute to the potential for increases in extreme events. The causes and physical mechanisms for the intensification of mean global temperature and regional precipitation variability are explored using observationally constrained datasets and non-traditional climate model approaches.",

            "abstract": "The Northern Hemisphere cryosphere’s response to the monotonic decline in summer insolation through the Holocene has been irregular expansion, interrupted by periods of retreat, culminating in the Little Ice Age, when most glaciers attained their maximum late Holocene dimensions. This non-linear response to near-linear forcing implies other factors modulate the radiative effects of the regular insolation decline. Understanding how the Earth system accomplishes this modulation is relevant to the development of reliable models for future climate change. Accurately dating the onset of persistent summer coolings across the Arctic is a first step toward developing this understanding. Here we report 52 precise radiocarbon dates on rooted plants emerging from beneath receding glaciers on Svalbard that define times when colder summers led to snowline depression and an expanded cryosphere. The earliest persistent depression of snowline documented by our dates occurred between 4.0 and 3.4 ka, but with little additional summer cooling until early in the first millennium AD. Episodes of subsequent summer cooling were centered on 240-340, 410-540 and 670-770 AD, followed by additional cooling between 1000 and 1230 AD, and between 1300 and 1470 AD. Cooling that occurred after 1470 AD, includes of the Little Ice Age when the Svalbard cryosphere reached its maximum Neoglacial dimensions. We suggest that in addition to insolation forcing, irregular reductions in the strength of the North Atlantic Current and expansions of Arctic Ocean sea ice were dominant factors that led to episodic snowline depression over Svalbard, but the extent to which these changes are linked to radiative forcing from volcanism or solar irradiance as opposed to unforced variability remains unclear. The widespread exposure of entombed plants dating from the first millennium AD suggests that Svalbard’s average summer temperatures of the past century now exceed those of any century since at least 700 AD, including medieval times.",

Since 2005 the suite of airborne measurements also includes ozone, humidity and temperature profiling through the troposphere (up to 8 km). Light commercial aircraft are equipped with modified 2B Technology ozone monitors (Model 205DB), incorporate temperature and humidity probes, and include global positioning system instrumentation. The dataset was analyzed for tropospheric ozone variability at five continental US stations. As site locations within the Tropospheric Aircraft Ozone Measurement Program have flights only once (four times at one site) a month and begun a decade ago, this raises the question of whether this sampling frequency allows the derivation of an accurate vertical climatology of ozone values. We interpret the representativeness of the vertical and seasonal ozone distribution from aircraft measurements using multi-decadal hindcast simulations conducted with the GFDL AM3 chemistry-climate model. When available, climatology derived from co-located ozone-sonde data will be used for comparisons. The results of the comparisons are analyzed to establish altitude ranges in the troposphere where the aircraft climatology would be deemed to be the most representative. Aircraft-based climatologies are tested from two approaches: comparing the aircraft-based climatology to the daily sampled model and to the subset of model data with matching aircraft dates. Whenever the model and aircraft climatologies show significant seasonal differences, further information is gathered from a seasonal Gaussian distribution plot. We will report on the minimum frequency in flights that can provide adequate climatological representation of seasonal and vertical variability in tropospheric ozone.",

            "abstract": "The Snake River in Hells Canyon supports a growing population of spawning Fall Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) immediately downstream of the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC) of hydroelectric dams for the last 60 years. The long-term survival of this salmon run depends on the input of spawning gravel (25-150 mm) from local tributaries balancing the losses of spawning gravel through attrition and export out of the reach between the HCC and the Salmon River confluence. We are working to quantify the gravel input of these local tributaries at different time-scales and put this into the context of historical supply and transport.\nLong-term total sediment production rates of these tributaries estimated through various methods have varied by over 2 orders of magnitude, but we have recently completed 10Be work to constrain these estimates. We are measuring the change in storage of Fall Chinook spawning-size gravel through repeat multibeam echosounder surveys of the riverbed. The limited amount of repeat data collected to date has shown complex patterns of change in the riverbed. One possible driver of this complexity is the episodic and spatially variable nature of sediment inputs from these tributaries. We are attempting to quantify the frequency of the debris flows or floods capable of transporting spawning gravel through digitizing historic imagery of the last 60 years to determine the recurrence interval. We are measuring the magnitude of these events by surveying tributary fans pre and post-event to measure the sediment volume and particle size produced by specific events. These floods and debris flows are driven by extreme rainfall or snowmelt events, so we have also reconstructed historical meteorological conditions to identify the triggering conditions for transport, and identify the areas where snowmelt or rainfall is the more likely trigger. We are currently testing whether the unique bedrock geology of Hells Canyon can be used as a tracer to identify the source areas and downstream transport of sediment in the canyon. While the HCC has trapped gravel transported from the Snake River immediately upstream, this input has been quite low due to particle attrition across long transport distances and low transport capacity of the reach just upstream of the HCC.",

            "abstract": "Adjoint-based tools can provide valuable insight into the mechanisms that influence the evolution and predictability of atmospheric phenomena, as they allow for the efficient and rigorous computation of forecast sensitivity to changes in the initial state. We apply adjoint-based tools from the non-hydrostatic Coupled Atmosphere/Ocean Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) to explore the initial-state sensitivity and interactions between a tropical cyclone and atmospheric equatorial waves associated with the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) in the Indian Ocean during the DYNAMO field campaign. The development of Tropical Cyclone 5 (TC05) coincided with the passage of an equatorial Kelvin wave and westerly wind burst associated with an MJO that developed in the Indian Ocean in late November 2011, but it was unclear if and how one affected the other. COAMPS 24-h and 36-h adjoint sensitivities are analyzed for both TC05 and the equatorial waves to understand how the evolution of each system is sensitive to the other. The sensitivity of equatorial westerlies in the western Indian Ocean on 23 November shares characteristics with the classic Gill (1980) Rossby and Kelvin wave response to symmetric heating about the equator, including symmetric cyclonic circulations to the north and south of the westerlies, and enhanced heating in the area of convergence between the equatorial westerlies and easterlies. In addition, there is sensitivity in the Bay of Bengal associated with the cyclonic circulation that eventually develops into TC05. At the same time, the developing TC05 system shows strongest sensitivity to local wind and heating perturbations, but sensitivity to the equatorial westerlies is also clear. On 24 November, when the Kelvin wave is immediately south of the developing tropical cyclone, both phenomena are sensitive to each other. On 25 November TC05 no longer shows sensitivity to the Kelvin wave, while the Kelvin Wave still exhibits some weak sensitivity to TC05. In summary, it appears that one system does not dominate the evolution of the other, but that both work synergistically to strengthen each other before and during their colocation. The similarity of the sensitivity pattern to the classic simple-model equatorial wave pattern supports the utility of adjoint diagnostics applied to tropical phenomena.",

In response to this challenge, the international community has mobilized to develop famine early warning systems (FEWS) to bring safe food and water to populations in need.\nOver the past several decades, much attention has focused on advance risk planning in agriculture and water. This requires frequent updates of weather and climate outlooks. This paper describes the active role of NOAA’s African Desk in FEWS. Emphasis is on the operational products from short and medium range weather forecasts to subseasonal and seasonal outlooks in support of humanitarian relief programs. Tools to provide access to real time weather and climate information to the public are described. These include the downscaling of the U.S. National Multi-model Ensemble (NMME) to improve seasonal forecasts in support of Regional Climate Outlook Forums (RCOFs). The subseasonal time scale has emerged as extremely important to many socio-economic sectors. Drawing from advances in numerical models that can now provide a better representation of the MJO, operational subseasonal forecasts are included in the African Desk product suite. These along with forecasts skill assessment and verifications are discussed. The presentation will also highlight regional hazards outlooks basis for FEWSNET food security outlooks.",

Despite nearly a century of research, the precise chronology for the Green Bay Lobe’s advance to and retreat from its maximum position, and the resulting damming and subsequent drainage of glacial Lake Wisconsin, remains unsettled (e.g., Colgan, 1992; Attig et al., 2011; Ullman et al., 2014).\nAge estimates from core collected in ice-proximal lacustrine sediment beyond the glacial margin provide chronologic constraint for ice margin fluctuations that controlled glacial Lake Wisconsin’s formation and drainage. Additional cores collected in glacial sediment at and behind the MIS 2 ice margin provide stratigraphic evidence for the dynamics of the GBL during the end of advance to, and the start of retreat from, the MIS 2 maximum. The combined data from these cores suggest that glacial Lake Wisconsin may have filled only once to its highest stage during the MIS 2 maximum, after ice blocked both the east end of the Baraboo Hills and the south end of the Devils Lake gorge. When the ice reached its maximum position and blocked the north end of the gorge, Devils Lake was isolated from glacial Lake Wisconsin and rose to a higher level.\nRadiocarbon and OSL ages from the Devils Lake gorge indicate that the GBL advanced to the MIS 2 maximum position by 24.6 ka, and remained at or near that location through 19.2 ± 3.2 ka. Radiocarbon ages from lacustrine sediment in a sub-basin of glacial Lake Wisconsin indicate that ice continued to block the Wisconsin River between 21.6 ka and 17.4 ka. The stratigraphy evident in cores at the Devils Lake gorge and south of the Baraboo Hills indicates that ice thinned and advanced immediately prior to retreat, likely in response to reduced basal shear stress as the bed of the glacier thawed.",

Correct interpretation of the detrital signature requires a multi-dating approach involving chronometers sensitive to different temperatures and processes. A multi-dating study of modern river sands from southern Tibet reveals distinct cooling signals that provide significant information about tectonic and erosional evolution of the Indus-Yarlung suture (IYS) after the India-Asia collision with implications for the Cenozoic topographic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. Modern sands from tributaries of the Yarlung River provide an opportunity to broadly sample source rocks exposed within the suture zone, including the Gangdese batholith, Xigaze forearc, Cenozoic basins, and Tethyan Himalayan rocks, and to investigate their regional geochemical signatures. Samples from rivers along the IYS in southern Tibet, between Xigaze and Mt. Kailas, were analyzed for detrital geochronology and low-temperature thermochronology. Comparison between ages recorded in the source and the detrital signature indicates that both the ages and their proportions directly reflect the ages and relative areas of source rocks in the catchment basins. Apatite fission track ages show two main cooling signals at 22-18 Ma and 12 Ma, which are consistent with accelerated exhumation of the Gangdese batholith and Oligo-Miocene Kailas basin and indicate significant regional exhumation of the IYS during the Miocene. Regional exhumation recorded throughout the IYS is likely the combined product of active Miocene tectonics and erosion of a paleo-Yarlung River. Efficient incision and evacuation of material from the IYS zone by a paleo-Yarlung River during the Miocene suggests a significantly different paleoenvironment than that which exists today. Miocene capture of the Yarlung River by the Brahmaputra River may have enhanced erosion in the IYS zone.",

            "abstract": "Series investigation of the Jiaozhou Bay, China, observed existences of three low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), including lactic acid, acetic acid and formic acid, with high concentration in the sea water. Generally, their amount accounted for about 20% of DOC in the sea water of the bay. Human activities around the bay were considered as the major source of the LMWOAs. Also, long term detection showed that the pH value in the Jiaozhou Bay was lower than that in the adjacent Yellow Sea. On average, the difference of pH values between the bay and the Yellow was about 0.2. Due to higher concentrations of the LMWOAs, their contribution to lower pH value of the bay should not be ignored. To validate the effect of LMWOAs on the pH value of the bay, a new software was developed to calculate the pH value in the sea water samples based on alkalinity by adding three items of the three organic acids in the expression. Compared to the traditional pH calculating software, the new software could improve the calculating results significantly. Our results confirmed that LMWOAs was an important control factor to adjust pH values in coastal area.",

            "abstract": "Taking students into the field can offer a rich, grounded understanding of a particular environment and of a particular scientific approach to attaining a desired observation. Going into the field immerses students into coupled human-natural systems, which introduces two key elements to teaching: experiential learning and socio-cultural context. While these elements can greatly enrich student learning, instructors have to take extra steps to scaffold this learning. This scaffolding can present physical scientists with a challenge: how to reconcile views that such pedagogical activities are ‘extraneous’/not central to the pursuit of physical science. Here we offer perspectives as an anthropologist and as an environmental scientist on the value of a diverse pedagogical approach to conducting field studies involving students.\nInsights drawn from facilitating a range of field experiences (e.g., short-term study abroad, service-learning and independent/supervised research both home and abroad) will be shared regarding approaches to scaffolding student learning. We will focus on an approach that the scholarship of teaching and learning has long shown to be effective - what can be called a “wrap-around” approach to the field: preparation before, support during, and reflection afterward. Of these steps, the post-trip reflection on the experience is a key, and often under-utilized, strategy, and suggestions as to why this are offered. This approach not only helps students understand better the course content, but it also helps them understand the role that socio-cultural context plays in shaping both the research and in the state of the environment. We illustrate these different dimensions of the field experience with examples from our courses.",

            "abstract": "Flow and transport characterization of fractured rock formations is very challenging and important for a multitude of applications that include groundwater extraction, nuclear waste storage and geothermal energy production. One popular hydrogeological method to study fractured rock is a push-pull test, in which injection and retrieval of a tracer is made at the same depth interval in a borehole. In theory, push-pull tests are not sensitive to changes in the heterogeneity of the tracer flow path since the retrieval at the injection location minimizes advective effects and makes the test more sensitive to time-dependent transport processes. This assumption is limiting in the presence of a natural hydraulic gradient or if non-neutrally buoyant tracers are used, but these limitations can be reduced by monitoring push-pull tests with ground penetrating radar (GPR). We present a methodology for combined modeling and inversion of a series of push-pull tests that we monitored with the single hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) method. For the GPR modeling we use a newly developed approach to simulate the GPR response in fractured rock. We coupled the GPR model to a flow-and-transport simulator that we use to define the electrical properties of the fracture filling.\nThe combined model can cope with heterogeneous fractures of any orientation, aperture and size and allows for the effect of density driven flow (that is strong during the saline tracer tests). We use the combined simulator to create synthetic datasets for both the time-series of the GPR traces at different locations and the tracer breakthrough curves. Since the combined problem is highly non-linear and the inverse solution is ill-posed, we use stochastic inversion techniques to obtain probabilistic estimates of the parameters of interest (fracture length, orientation and aperture distribution) and assess the use of different measures to compare the simulated and experimental data.",

On February 27, 2014, the US Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) navigation service over eastern Alaska and northeastern continental US was degraded due to a strong ionospheric storm. Similarly, on March 17, the St. Patrick’s Day geomagnetic storm commenced, resulting in the most intense storm of the solar cycle to date with mid-latitude auroral sightings, intense ionospheric irregularities and WAAS degradation. On June 22, a strong (G4) geomagnetic storm commenced following the impact of 3 coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Late on June 22, solar protons entered the polar regions along open magnetic field lines producing intense radio absorption. We summarize, compare and contrast the space environmental state for each of these events from the perspective of NOAA observations and model predictions. We do so by leveraging GOES and POES/MetOp observations of the space radiation environment, DMSP observations of precipitating particles and bulk plasma parameters, OVATION Prime predictions of the auroral energy input and the US Total Electron Content (USTEC) and D-Region Absorption Prediction (DRAP) modeled response of the ionosphere.

            "abstract": "In response to the increasing demand for food linked to the substantial growth of population in Burkina Faso, irrigation has been widely used by the farming community to support agricultural production. Thus a promising option for water resources development in such a context is to increase the number of small dams. It is assumed that the great number of small dams may have effect on sub-basins’ hydrological dynamic. This study aims to assess the seasonal and the intra-seasonal change in river basins hydrology with the case study of the Faga River sub-basin located in Burkina-Faso, West Africa, using Water Simulation Model (WaSiM). For this watershed the number of small dams is slightly very important (More than 60) and their impact on the watershed runoff has been estimated simultaneously with the change in climate pattern. The coefficient of variation for rainfall in this sub-basin from 1982 to 2010 is 0.097 and the stream flow presents a seasonal average of 25.58Km3 per month for the same period. The intra-seasonal climate variation for the same period is estimated at 0.087 in the scenario where any dam has not been considered.\nResults based on simulation including the five important dams over the sub-basin show that the overall effect of small dams is on average a 20.76% in runoff. Projections using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios with increase of 25% of dams’ number show a probable decrease of about 29.54% and 35.25% of the average during the next fifty years runoff. The study findings show that small dams reduce significantly the runoff from their watershed and the uncertainties related to the sustainability of the resource seems to be increasing during the same period.\nTherefore, despite the very large number of water storage infrastructures, reservoirs operating strategies have to be achieved for water sustainability within the Faga sub-basin.",

The comparatively low-energy H3O+ ionization technique is ideal for measuring complex mixtures of hydrocarbons, and, compared to conventional quadrupole PTRMS, the newest generation of ToF-CIMS measure many more species simultaneously and with a sensitivity that is as high as a quadrupole PTR-MS. We describe here the development of a commercially available ToF CIMS into an H3O+CIMS suitable for deployment on aircraft, and its application during an aircraft campaign studying emissions from oil and natural gas extraction industry.\nWe provide an overview of instrument development and specifications, including design, characterization, and field operation. We then discuss data processing and interpretation. First, we investigate determination of intensities of poorly resolved peaks. The mass resolution of the present instrument (m/Δm ~4500) enables separate analysis of many isobaric peaks, but peaks are also frequently not fully resolved. Using results from laboratory tests, we quantify how the accuracy can be limited by the overlap in neighboring peaks, and compare to theoretical predictions from literature. We then briefly describe our method for quality assurance of reported compounds, and correction for background and humidity effects. Finally, we present preliminary results from the first field deployment of this instrument during the Spring 2015 SONGNEX aircraft campaign. This campaign sampled emissions from oil and natural gas extraction regions and associated infrastructure in the Western and Central United States. We will highlight results that illustrate (1) new scientific capability from improved mass resolution, which dramatically increased the number of species measured, and (2) new capability from improved time resolution, which provides better spatial coverage during flights, leads to a more thorough and accurate measure of emissions composition, and potentially could enable emission rate estimates using eddy covariance analysis.",

            "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) has received increasing attention in many fields with its wide applications and rapid growth in production. Therefore, it is expected that GO nanoparticles will inevitably be released into the subsurface and cause the environmental risk subsequently. In view of this, knowledge of the fate for GO in the vadose zone and groundwater systems is indispensable. So far most research has focused on the deposition and transport of GO nanoparticles in one-dimensional homogenous porous media; nonetheless, the complex heterogeneous system is extensively distributed in natural subsurface environment and may not be well represented by the homogeneous packed columns. However, little investigations have been directed toward understanding the transport of GO in heterogeneous porous media.\nThe overarching objective of this study is to advance current understanding of GO transport in structured heterogeneous porous media. The saturated and unsaturated columns packed with different sand combinations and solution ionic strength, were used to examine the breakthrough behavior of GO in heterogeneous porous media. A two-domain model considering GO exchange between zones was developed to describe GO transport in structured, heterogeneous porous media. The experimental data indicate that volumetric moisture content and water flow are the critical factors that control GO transport in heterogeneous porous media. And higher ionic strength decrease the mobility of GO particles in both saturated and unsaturated heterogeneous pore media. Simulations of this two-domain nanoparticle transport model matched experimental breakthrough data well for all the experimental conditions. Experimental and model results show that under saturated conditions, both fast-flow and slow-flow domains affect colloid transport in heterogeneous media. Under unsaturated conditions, however, our results indicate that flows in the fast flow domain dominate the colloid transport and retention processes.",

            "abstract": "Bioenergy crops have the potential to provide a low carbon-intensive alternative to fossil fuels. More than a century of agricultural research has shown that conventional cropping systems can reduce soil organic matter (SOM) reservoirs, which cause long-term soil nutrient loss and C release to the atmosphere. In the face of climate change and other human disruptions to biogeochemical cycles, identifying biofuel crops that can maintain or enhance soil resources is desirable for the sustainable production of bioenergy. The objective of our study was to compare the effects of four biofuel crop treatments on SOM dynamics in two agricultural soils: Mollisols at Arlington Agricultural Research Station in Wisconsin and Alfisols at Kellogg Biological Station in Michigan, USA. We used fresh soils collected in 2013 and archived soils from 2008 to measure the effects of five years of crop management. Using a one-year long laboratory soil incubation coupled with a regression model and radiocarbon measurements, we separated soils into three SOM pools and their corresponding C turnover times. We found that the active pool, or biologically available C, was more sensitive to management and is an earlier indicator of changes to soil C dynamics than bulk soil C measurements. There was no effect of treatment on the active pool size at either site; however, the percent C in the active pool decreased, regardless of crop type, in surface soils with high clay content. At depth, the response of the slow pool differed between annual and perennial cropping systems. The distribution of C among SOM fractions varied between the two soil types, with greater C content associated with the active fraction in the coarser textured-soil and greater C content associated with the slow-cycling fraction in the soils with high clay content. These results suggest that the effects of bioenergy crops on soil resources will vary geographically, with implications for the carbon-cost of biocrop production.",

            "abstract": "Photochemical ozone production results from the oxidation and reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO2 + NO). As with many US urban regions, ozone levels observed in the Northern Front Range Metropolitan Region of Colorado are influenced by urban emissions of NOx and VOCs. Despite nationwide decreases in these urban emissions, the Front Range of Colorado is one of the few US locations where ozone is currently increasing. It has also recently gone out of compliance with national ambient air quality standards for ozone during summer months. High ozone in Colorado may result from a number of factors, including long-range transport from Asia, increased influence of biomass burning, population increases, or increased emissions from oil and gas activities. The Front Range is home to the Denver-Julesburg (D-J) Basin, which has recently been experiencing a rise in oil and natural gas (O&NG) activity associated with the increase in non-conventional drilling techniques. The VOC and NOx emissions from O&NG activity in close proximity to the urban area may uniquely influence ozone in this region.\nThis presentation will focus on using reactive nitrogen (NOx, NOy) and ozone measurements from a tall (300 m) tower to study the influence of local emissions on Front Range ozone. The tower is located between the D-J Basin and agricultural areas to the north and the Denver metro area to the south. In-situ reactive nitrogen and ozone measurements were collected using a custom Cavity Ring-Down instrument. Additional CH4, CO, and NH3 measurements from the tower serve as tracers for O&NG, urban, and agricultural emissions. Concurrently measured aircraft data is used to confirm the relationships between the tracer species. This presentation will discuss methods for determining the contributions of different emission sources to Front Range ozone, with a focus on differentiating the influence of urban and O&NG sources.",

            "abstract": "At Crater Hills, a thermally-altered area adjoining the Sour Creek resurgent dome that is located within the Yellowstone Caldera, we characterized volatile emissions based upon our soil degassing measurements and soil gas chemistry in 2014 and fumarole gas chemistry in 2007 (Bergfeld et al., 2011). The investigation at Crater Hills on its diffuse gases isotopes and CO2, H2S emission improve our understanding on its gas emission mode – including total emission and spatial distribution, and contribute to a more accurate estimation of total CO2 emission at Yellowstone volcanic system. The total emission of CO2 interpolated by sequential Gaussian simulation method (sGs) was 66 to 109 t d-1 with 95% confidence, which is an underestimation due to the inability to measure a high flux area on a slope as well as the absence of fumarole and pool emissions[CAW1] [CAW2] [CAW3] . Indicated by gas chemistry data of the fumarole at Crater Hills in 2007, the proportion of CO2 derived from magma would be at least 38% if considering the worst and unreasonable scenario; other scenarios give a much higher proportion of magma component, which would be over 50%. Faults or fractures covered by overlying alluvium are very likely to exist at Crater Hills, based on the similarity between the connection of high flux areas and the trend of the regional faults. The estimated emission of H2S was 0.39 t d-1, based on the linear correlation between H2S and CO2. The heat output was also estimated to be ~35MW with a[CAW4] verage heat flux of ~100 W m-2 based upon CO2-H2O-heat relations. The temperature of liquid-dominated reservoir was estimated to be 270-300 ⁰C estimated by Fournier (1989), and was 213 ºC to 217 ºC for the vapor-dominated reservoir which is the source for the sampled fumarole gas in 2007.",

            "abstract": "The herbicides alachlor, atrazine, and dicamba, as well as bromide were applied to soils overlying the High Plains aquifer in Nebraska, to both macropore and non-macropore sites. Three of 6 study areas (exhibiting a high percentage of macropores) were used for analysis of chemical transport. Twelve intact soil cores (30 cm diameter; 40 cm height), were excavated (two each from 0-40 cm and 40-80 cm depths). The first three study areas and soil cores were used to study preferential flow characteristics using dye staining and to determine hydraulic properties; the remaining cores were treated the same as field macropore sites. Two undisturbed experimental field plots, each with a 1 m2 surface area, were established in each of the three macropore study areas. Each preferential plot was instrumented with suction lysimeters, tensiometers, and neutron access tubes – 10 cm increments to 80 cm – and planted in corn. Three study areas that did not exhibit macropores had alachlor, atrazine, and dicamba and bromide disked into the top 15 cm of soil; concentrations were tracked for 120 days - samples were collected on a grid, distributed within 3 plots measuring 50 m x 50 m each. Core samples were collected prior to and immediately after application, and then at 30, 60, and 120 days after application. Each lab core sample was in 15-cm lengths from 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 45-60 cm, and 75-90 cm. For areas exhibiting macropores, herbicides had begun to move between 10-15 days after application with concentrations peaking at various depths after heavy rainfall events. Field lysimeter samples showed increases in concentrations of herbicides at depths where laboratory data indicated greater percentages of preferential flowpaths. Concentrations of atrazine, alachlor and dicamba exceeding 0.30, 0.30, and 0.05 µg m1-1 respectively were observed with depth (10-30 cm and 50-70 cm) after two months following heavy rainfall events indicating that preferential flowpaths were a significant factor in transport of these herbicides, i.e., chemicals were leached away at these sites. By comparison, concentrations of alachlor on non-macropore sites ranged from 20-55 μg ml-1 for the first 30 days and none thereafter indicating that initially non-macropore sites had longer residence times, allowing for less chemical transport and more decay.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are understood as frictional stick-slip instabilities in which stored elastic energy is released suddenly, driving catastrophic failure. In normal (fast) earthquakes the rupture zone expands at a rate dictated by elastic wave speeds, a few km/s, and fault slip rates reach 1-10 m/s. However, tectonic faults also fail in slow earthquakes with rupture durations of months and fault slip speeds of ~100 micron/s or less. We know very little about the mechanics of slow earthquakes. What determines the rupture propagation velocity in slow earthquakes and in other forms of quasi-dynamic rupture? What processes limit stress drop and fault slip speed in slow earthquakes? Existing lab studies provide some help via observations of complex forms of stick-slip, creep-slip, or, in a few cases, slow slip. However, these are mainly anecdotal and rarely include examples of repetitive slow slip or systematic measurements that could be used to isolate the underlying mechanisms. Numerical studies based on rate and state friction also shed light on transiently accelerating slip, showing that slow slip can occur if: 1) fault rheology involves a change in friction rate dependence (a-b) with velocity or unusually large values of the frictional weakening distance Dc, or 2) fault zone elastic stiffness equals the critical frictional weakening rate kc = (b-a)/Dc. Recent laboratory work shows that the latter can occur much more commonly that previously thought. We document the complete spectrum of stick-slip behaviors from transient slow slip to fast stick-slip for a narrow range of conditions around k/kc = 1.0. Slow slip occurs near the threshold between stable and unstable failure, controlled by the interplay of fault zone frictional properties, normal stress, and elastic stiffness of the surrounding rock. Our results provide a generic mechanism for slow earthquakes, consistent with the wide range of conditions for which slow slip has been observed.",

            "abstract": "Slow earthquakes, tectonic fault tremor and other modes of quasi-dynamic slip represent an important enigma. In the standard earthquake model, elastic energy is released catastrophically as the fault weakens and dynamic rupture expands at speeds measured in km/s. The spectral content of the resulting seismic waves is understood in terms of a source model based on elastodynamic rupture propagation. However, faults also fail in slow earthquakes and there is no such understanding of rupture dynamics, seismic spectra, or source scaling relations in these cases. The mechanics of slow earthquakes are poorly understood in part because there are few systematic laboratory observations that can be used to identify the underlying mechanics. Here, I summarize and discuss results from numerical models of slow slip using rate/state friction laws and recent lab studies showing slow slip and the full spectrum of stick-slip behaviors. Early lab studies saw slow slip during frictional sliding or in association with dehydration or ductile flow; however, they did not include systematic measurements that could be used to isolate the underlying mechanics. Numerical studies based on rate/state friction also document slow slip and chaotic forms of stick-slip, however they require special conditions including two state variable frictional behavior. Recent lab work sheds new light on slow earthquakes by showing: 1) that repetitive, slow stick-slip can occur if the fault friction-velocity relation becomes positive during slip acceleration, and 2) that slow slip and the full spectrum of fault slip modes can occur if loading stiffness k matches the fault zone critical rheologic stiffness kc given by the frictional weakening rate and the critical frictional distance. These data show that the key control parameter for stress drop, slip speed, and slip duration is the non dimensional stiffness k’ = k/kc, with the spectrum of fast to slow slip mode occurring in a narrow range around k’=1. I discuss: 1) implications of these results for stress drop of slow earthquakes and the spectrum of fault slip behaviors and 2) fault zone stiffness in the source region of slow earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The largest volcanic plains deposits on Mercury are situated in its northern hemisphere and include the extensive northern smooth plains and the Caloris interior plains. Crater size–frequency analyses have shown that both deposits were emplaced around 3.8 Ga, for any of the published model production function (MPF) chronologies for impact crater formation on Mercury. The largest volcanic deposit in the southern hemisphere, the Rembrandt interior plains, has a model age of ~3.7 Ga. To test the hypothesis that all major volcanic smooth plains on Mercury were emplaced at about the same time, we determined crater size–frequency distributions for nine additional deposits (see Table 1). The diameters of craters that superpose the smooth plains at each site were measured with CraterTools, yielding crater areal densities in terms of N(10), the number of craters ≥10 km in diameter per 106 km2 area (Table 1). Our crater density measurements span N(10) values of 29–146, a range that encompasses corresponding values for the larger areas of smooth plains. With CraterStats, we fit our data (for craters ≥4 km in diameter) to the MPF chronologies of Le Feuvre and Wieczorek. For porous scaling, the model ages of all nine sites span a narrow window (Table 1). Non-porous scaling fails to match the crater size–frequency distributions. We show that widespread plains volcanism, likely the primary process by which Mercury’s crust developed, had ended by 3.6 Ga. Younger volcanic deposits have been identified on the planet, but only within impact structures and at volumes much less than the smallest deposit considered here. Superposition relations between shortening landforms and craters on Mercury indicate that global contraction in response to interior cooling was underway by ~3.6 Ga. The cessation of widespread plains volcanism on Mercury may therefore reflect the onset of a stress state within the planet’s lithosphere that inhibited magma ascent. Conversely, mantle thermochemical evolution models indicate that magma generation may have been voluminous only until ~3.5 Ga. Whatever the cause, the main building phase of Mercury’s crust ended within the first 20% of the age of the planet, with only small-scale, explosive volcanism enduring beyond that time.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes experiments conducted with a Honeywell GTCP36-150 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to evaluate the effects of varying fuel composition on particle emissions. The APU uses a single-stage compressor stage, gas turbine engine with a can-type combustor to generate bypass flow and electrical power for supporting small aircraft and helicopters. It is installed in a “hush-house” at NASA Glenn Research Center and is configured as a stand-alone unit that can be fueled from an onboard tank or external supply. It operates at constant RPM, but its fuel flow can be varied by changing the electrical load or volume of bypass flow. For these tests, an external bank of resistors were attached to the APU’s DC and AC electrical outlets and emissions measurements were made at low, medium and maximum electrical current loads. Exhaust samples were drawn from several points downstream in the exhaust duct and fed to an extensive suite of gas and aerosol sensors installed within a mobile laboratory parked nearby. Aromatic- and sulfur-free synthetic kerosenes from Rentech, Gevo, UOP, Amyris and Sasol were tested and their potential to reduce PM emissions evaluated against a single Jet A1 base fuel. The role of aromatic compounds in regulating soot emissions was also evaluated by adding metered amounts of aromatic blends (Aro-100, AF-Blend, SAK) and pure compounds (tetracontane and 1-methylnaphthalene) to a base alternative fuel (Sasol). Results show that, relative to Jet A1, alternative fuels reduce nonvolatile particle number emissions by 50-80% and--by virtue of producing much smaller particles—mass emissions by 65-90%; fuels with the highest hydrogen content produced the greatest reductions. Nonvolatile particle emissions varied in proportion to fuel aromatic content, with additives containing the most complex ring structures producing the greatest emission enhancements. ",

            "abstract": "Relatively large uncertainties remain in climate model predictions of absorption resulting from black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC). In this study, we focus on comparing simulated profiles of BC, biomass burning aerosols, absorption, and other aerosol optical properties obtained from the regional WRF-Chem model with in situ and remote sensing measurements made during the Department of Energy’s Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP). TCAP was designed to investigate changes in aerosol mixing state, aerosol radiative forcing, CCN concentration, and cloud-aerosol interactions in two atmospheric columns: one over Cape Cod, Massachusetts and another located approximately 200 km to the east over the ocean. Measurements from the NASA second-generation airborne High Resolution Spectral Lidar reveal the presence distinct aerosol layers associated with the marine boundary layer, residual layer transported over the ocean and in the free troposphere. Analyses of SP2 and aerosol optical measurements indicate that particles in the free troposphere were more ‘aged’ and had a lower single scattering albebo than for aerosol layers at lower altitudes; however, BC concentrations aloft were lower in the free troposphere. Instead, particle classes derived from the miniSPLAT single particle measurements suggest that the increased absorption aloft may be due biomass burning aerosols. The model suggests that ambient winds likely transported smoke from large wildfires in central Canada as well as smoke from other fires into the sampling domain. The simulated percentage of biomass burning aerosols was consistent with the miniSPLAT data, but the model currently treats all organic matter as non-absorbing. Therefore, we perform sensitivity simulations to examine how the model’s absorption and AOD responds to assumptions used for BrC associated with biomass burning and whether the predicted profiles agree with absorption data and wavelength dependent AOD data from 4STAR.",

            "abstract": "The Newberry Volcano, within the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon, has been designated as a candidate site for the Department of Energy’s Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) program. This site was stimulated using high-pressure fluid injection during the fall of 2012, which generated several hundred microseismic events. Exploring the spatial and temporal development of microseismicity is key to understanding how subsurface stimulation modifies stress, fractures rock, and increases permeability. We analyze Newberry seismicity using both surface and borehole seismometers from the AltaRock and LLNL seismic networks. For our analysis we adapt PageRank, Google’s initial search algorithm, to evaluate microseismicity during the 2012 stimulation. PageRank is a measure of connectivity, where higher ranking represents highly connected windows. In seismic applications connectivity is measured by the cross correlation of 2 time windows recorded on a common seismic station and channel. Aguiar and Beroza (2014) used PageRank based on cross correlation to detect low-frequency earthquakes, which are highly repetitive but difficult to detect. We expand on this application by using PageRank to define signal-correlation topology for micro-earthquakes, including the identification of signals that are connected to the largest number of other signals. We then use this information to create signal families and compare PageRank families to the spatial and temporal proximity of associated earthquakes. Studying signal PageRank will potentially allow us to efficiently group earthquakes with similar physical characteristics, such as focal mechanisms and stress drop. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether changes in the state of stress and/or changes in the generation of subsurface fracture networks can be detected using PageRank topology.

            "abstract": "The flow of two or more immiscible phases within geologic porous media is important in natural and industrial processes like geologic CO2 sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and hydraulic fracturing. The latter one, however, is a well-known reservoir stimulation technique, by which the permeability of the near-wellbore region is enhanced through the creation of tensile fractures within the rock, formed in the direction perpendicular to the least principal stress. While it is well known that fracturing of granular media strongly depends on the type of media and on the variability of its wetting properties, the effect of wettability on capillary-driven fracturing continues to challenge our microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. Here we study this problem experimentally, starting with the classic experiment of two-phase flow in a horizontal Hele-Shaw cell filled with a granular medium. We inject a low-viscosity fluid into a thin bed of glass beads initially saturated with a fluid 350 times more viscous. We investigate three control parameters: the injection rate of the less-viscous invading phase, the confining stress, and the contact angle, which we control by carefully chosen fluid pairs covering the entire range from drainage to imbibition. Our results demonstrate that wettability exerts a powerful influence on the invasion/fracturing morphology of unfavorable mobility displacements. High time resolution imaging techniques and particle image velocimetry (PIV) allow us to quantify matrix displacement and fracture opening dynamics. Our findings provide insights on fracture propagation, fracture length distribution and the fracture drainage area, parameters which are critically important to better understand long-term hydrocarbon production from shale.",

These fluids are a product of a complex tectonic history related to terrane accretion that includes oblique convergence, metamorphism, magmatism, and orogenic collapse. From W-to-E, these fluid systems are as follows. High-pressure greenschist-to-amphibolite facies metasedimentary rocks of the WMB record variable mineral δD (–61 to –104‰) and δ18O (e.g., quartz +9.6 to +13.4‰) values with multiple minerals in apparent isotopic equilibrium (T ~ 450-550°C) suggest a low W/R system dominated by metamorphic fluids. Variable and non-equilibrium δD (–53 to –143‰) and δ18O (e.g., biotite +2.3 to +5.3‰) values from diorites of the Quottoon pluton affected by the ductile CRM suggest a complex evolution that involved both metamorphic and meteoric-hydrothermal fluids in this dextral shear zone; these results differ from those 300 km along strike to the north that documented only metamorphic fluids in the CRM (Goldfarb et al., 1988). Our data and those of Magaritz and Taylor (1976) from granulite facies metasediments of the CGC and plutons of the western CRB reveal homogeneous δD values (–62 to –78‰) and a restricted range of δ18O values (e.g., quartz +8.5 to +11.5‰) with all minerals in equilibrium at T > 570°C indicate a system dominated by magmatic fluids. Calculated whole-rock δ18O values (~ +7‰) for the Quottoon pluton and CRB intrusive rocks suggest a mantle origin for these magmas. Reinterpretation of very low δD (< –150‰) and quartz-feldspar δ18O pairs that display extreme disequilibrium (feldspar δ18O values as low as –5‰) from the Ponder pluton, eastern CRB, and Hazelton Group point reveals that the major meteoric-hydrothermal system that affected these rocks was related to Eocene detachment faulting along the Shames Lake fault system, a regional-scale extensional structure.",

            "abstract": "Reliable electric power is a staple of our modern society.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the occurrence of power outages under more intense, future Hurricane Sandy simulations in Connecticut. In addition, we also evaluated how many crews would be necessary to restore power in 7 days, and how different vegetation scenarios might contribute to a decrease in outages. We trained five pairwise models on each current Sandy runs (2012) as training using the random forest model (each validated using 10-fold cross-validation), and used each future Sandy run as an independent test. We predict that a future Sandy would have 2.5x as many outages as current Sandy, which would require 3.23x as many crews as current Sandy to restore power in 7 days. We also found that increased vegetation management might decrease outages, which has implications for both fair-weather and storm days of all types (i.e. blizzards, thunderstorms, ice storms). Although we have only evaluated outages for electric distribution networks, there are many other types (water supply, wastewater, telecommunications) that would likely benefit from an analysis of this type. In addition, given that we have the weather simulations already processed within our 2-km weather simulation domain, we would like to expand our vulnerability analyses to surrounding utilities in New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire to facilitate regional coordination among electric distribution networks.",

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of magnetic reconnection, especially at electron scales, is still poorly understood. One process that warrants further investigation is the role of wave phenomenon in mediating magnetic reconnection. Previous observations have shown the presence of electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) as well as whistler mode waves near the dayside reconnection site. Additionally, recent simulations have suggested that whistler waves might be generated by electron phase space holes associated with ESWs as they propagate along the magnetic separatrix towards the diffusion region. Other observations have shown ESWs with distinct speeds and time scales, suggesting that different instabilities generate the ESWs. NASA’s recently launched Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission presents a unique opportunity to investigate the roles of wave phenomena, such as ESWs and whistlers, in asymmetric reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. We will present 3-D electric and magnetic field data from magnetopause crossings by MMS during its first dayside science phase. Burst mode wave data and electron distributions from all four spacecraft will be analyzed to investigate the origin of these wave phenomena, as well as their impact on the reconnection electric field.",

            "abstract": "Here we examine the effect of oxygen fugacity on trace element partitioning between basaltic and sulfidic liquids. We specifically focus on parent-daughter pairs (Sm-Nd, Re-Os, Lu-Hf, Hf-W, U-Pb, and Th-Pb), such that the isotopic effects associated with sulfide fractionation can be predicted. This work is motivated by recent experiments and observations that suggest Earth experienced massive sequestration of a sulfide liquid to its core during the accretion phase, possibly under extremely reduced conditions. Experiments were run in graphite capsules using a piston-cylinder apparatus (1500°C, 1GPa). Starting compositions comprised ~2/3 of a synthetic MORB and ~1/3 FeS by weight. Oxygen fugacity was varied by adding the Fe component of the MORB starting composition as either FeO or FeSi2. Trace elements were added either as solutions or metal powders. Run durations ranged between one and four hours. The recovered samples were polished using either water or ethanol for lubrication, and then carbon-coated prior to analysis. Major elements were analyzed using a combination of EDS and WDS techniques. Trace element analyses are currently underway.\nExperiments with iron added as FeSi2 have relatively lower concentrations of O in the sulfide, lower concentrations of Fe in the basalt, and higher concentrations of S in the basalt. These same experiments contained sub-micron CaS and MgS phases within the FeS phase. These observations are consistent with the achievement of very low oxygen fugacity for experiments with FeSi2 added compared to experiments with FeO added. Once trace element partition coefficients are determined, they will be coupled to radiogenic isotope evolution models associated with sulfide fractionation under varying redox conditions.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the synergy of collocated microwave radiometry and near-infrared imagery to estimate the planetary boundary layer water vapor. Microwave radiometry provides the total column water vapor, while the near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor. In combining the two data sets, we apply several flags as well as proximity tests to remove pixels with high clouds and / or intrapixel heterogeneity. Comparisons against radiosondes (MAGIC, VOCALS-REX, etc) and ECMWF reanalysis data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. It is shown that the measured AMSR-MODIS boundary layer water vapor can be analyzed using sea surface temperature and cloud top pressure information by employing simple equations based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse thermal images of the lake surface are used to investigate the circulation and cooling patterns of three lava lakes: Kilauea’s Halema’uma’u crater, Mount Erebus, and Nyiragongo. We report results for the time-dependent, two-dimensional velocity and temperature fields of the lake surface. These data sets constrain the locations of flow divergence (upwelling) and convergence (downwelling), the distribution of distinct “plates” and “rifts”, the dominant time scales for changes in flow pattern at each lake, and the physical properties of the magma.\nUpwelling and downwelling locations are strikingly different between the three lakes. Upwelling at Nyiragongo and Erebus occurs dominantly in the interior of the lake, where it is occasionally interrupted by catastrophic downwellings. At Halema’uma’u upwelling and downwelling occur consistently along the perimeter. It remains to be seen whether these differences are dictated merely by the system’s geometry or are indicative of intrinsic factors such as melt viscosity, temperature and volatile and crystal content, or of conduit processes such as gas pistoning or slug flow.\nThe availability of high resolution data at Halema’uma’u allows as us to document the evolution of crustal plates and rifts and to investigate the physical properties of the lava and the crust. The physical properties of the lake’s surface control lake cooling rates, and thus need to be included in lake circulation and thermal evolution models. We produce time-temperature cooling curves from surface temperature profiles normal to surface rifts and by tracking the cooling of intra-plate bubble bursts. By comparing observations to analytical cooling models, we estimate a porosity of > 80% during the high stand of the lake, slightly higher than estimates of 70% for the upper 120 meters based on gravity data, and close to the porosity of clasts ejected from the lake during recent minor explosions. Furthermore,we find that the number of surface plates is correlated with the lake surface velocity, and that velocity increases preceding the break-up of plates, favoring a gas accumulation and collapse model over a slug model.",

            "abstract": "This study compares the scale-dependent variation in hourly Mean Areal Precipitation (MAP) derived from a satellite (S) and a radar-gauge (R) quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE), and seeks to explain the S-R differences on the basis of errors in the satellite QPE. This study employs an analytical framework to estimate the coefficient of variation (CV) of MAP for window sizes ranging from 4 to 512 km, using the rainfall fields of the CPC Morphing (CMORPH) satellite QPE and a radar-gauge multisensor QPE (MQPE) over five domains centered in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Our analyses reveal that CMORPH-based CV tends to plateau at larger window sizes (referred to as critical window size, or CWS), and is broadly higher in magnitude than that based on MQPE. The mechanisms underlying the CV differences differ between winter and summer. Over the winter, CMORPH suffers from severe underdetection, which yields suppressed fractional coverage (FC) across window sizes. This underestimation of FC, together with the lack of resolution of internal rainfall structure by CMORPH, leads to an magnification of both CWS and the magnitude of CV. By contrast, over the summer, widespread false precipitation detections in CMORPH lead to inflated FC, which tends to suppress CWS but this effect is outweighed by the opposing impacts of inflated outer and inner scales (i.e., distance parameters of indicator and conditional correlograms). Synthetic experiment shows that downscaling using the CMORPH-based CV tends to produce overly suppressed variance at finer spatial scales.",

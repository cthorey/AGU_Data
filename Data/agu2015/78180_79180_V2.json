            "abstract": "Black carbon aerosol (BC) deposited to the Arctic sea ice or present in the free troposphere can significantly affect the Earth's radiation budget at high latitudes yet the BC burden in these regions and the regional source contributions are poorly constrained. Aircraft measurements of aerosol composition in the European Arctic were conducted during March 2013. Pollutant plumes were encountered throughout the lower to upper Arctic troposphere featuring enhancements in CO and aerosol mass loadings, which were chemically speciated into BC and non-refractory sulphate and organic matter. FLEXPART-WRF simulations have been performed to evaluate the likely contribution to the pollution from regional ground sources. By combining up-to-date anthropogenic and open fire biomass burning (OBB) inventories, we have been able to compare the contributions made to the observed pollution layers from the sources of eastern/northern Asia (AS), Europe (EU) and North America (NA). Over 90% of the contribution to the pollution was shown to arise from non-OBB anthropogenic sources. \nAS sources were found to be the major contributor to the BC burden in the middle and upper troposphere. EU sources influenced the middle troposphere but made a minor contribution to the upper troposphere due to the relatively high latitude of the source region. The contribution of NA was shown to be much lower at all altitudes. It is estimated that 60–95% of BC is scavenged between emission and receptor based on BC/ΔCO comparisons between source inventories and measurement. \nWe show that during the springtime of 2013, the anthropogenic pollution particularly from sources in Asia, contributed significantly to BC across the European Arctic free troposphere. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution from open wildfires was minimal. Given that Asian pollution is likely to continue to rise over the coming years, it is likely that the radiative forcing in the Arctic will also continue to increase.",

            "abstract": "The increasing use of GNSS for navigation and precise positioning leads to the need of more and more accurate knowledge of the morphology and dynamics of the ionosphere. In fact, it is well known that the ionospheric induced delay is the main error on the GNSS precise positioning applications. On the other hand, GNSS signals propagating through the ionosphere are useful to probe the ionization of the upper atmosphere.\nRING (Rete Integrata GPS Nazionale) is a dense geodetic network of GPS stations managed by INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) including about 180 receivers deployed on the whole Italian peninsula. Data acquired by the receivers were initially collected and stored to perform mainly studies focused on crustal deformations, caused both by plates movement and by earthquakes effects.\nThe main goal of the IONORING (IONOspheric RING) project is to exploit data from the RING network to obtain ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) maps with very fine spatial resolution (0.1°x0.1°, lat x long) in near real-time. Ad hoc calibration and interpolation algorithms are applied to RINEX data to produce rapid and final products. The former are generated with a time lag of about 1 hour, the latter, characterized by a higher accuracy, are produced with a time lag of maximum 48 hours. These maps will be useful to support ionospheric error mitigation in precise positioning (rapid product) and to study the ionosphere morphology and dynamics during strong solar and geomagnetic storms affecting the mid-latitude ionosphere (final product).\nMaps and data resulting from the data-processing will be available on a dedicated web page through the electronic Space Weather upper atmosphere portal managed by INGV (www.eswua.it).\nIn this paper, some preliminary results of the IONORING project are presented as well as the ICT interface of the project.",

            "abstract": "The main scientific objective of the Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission (CONSERT) aboard ESA spacecraft Rosetta is the dielectric characterization of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko’s nucleus.\nThis was done by means of bi-static radio propagation measurements of the CONSERT instrument between the lander Philae launched onto the comet’s surface and the orbiter Rosetta. The CONSERT unit aboard the lander was receiving and processing the radio signal emitted by the orbiter counterpart of the instrument. The lander unit was then retransmitting a signal back to the orbiter. This happened at a time scale of milliseconds.\nIn addition to the operation at the first science sequence, CONSERT was operated during the separation and descent of Philae onto the comet's surface.\nDuring the descent phase of Philae the received CONSERT signal was a superposition of the direct propagation path between Rosetta and Philae and indirect paths caused by reflections of 67P/C-G’s surface.\nFrom peak power measurements of the dominant direct path between Rosetta and Philae during the descent we were able to reconstruct the lander’s attitude and estimate the spin rate of the lander along the descent trajectory. Certain operations and manoeuvres of orbiter and lander, e.g. the deployment of the lander legs and CONSERT antennas or the orbiter change of attitude in order to orient the science towards the assumed lander position, are also visible in the CONSERT data.\nThe information gained on the landers attitude is used in the reconstruction of the dielectric properties of 67P/C-G’s surface and near subsurface (metric to decametric scale).\nDuring roughly the last third of the descent, the comet’s surface is visible for the CONSERT instrument enabling a mean permittivity estimation of the surface and near subsurface covered by the instruments footprint along the descent path. The comparatively large timespan with surface signatures exhibits a good spatial diversity necessary for the mapping of dominant signatures and the estimation of the dielectric properties of prominent features. From this data it is possible to create a contrast and permittivity mapping of the comet’s surface in the vicinity of the Agilkia landing site.",

            "abstract": "After twenty years of quiescence, Fogo volcano, the most active in the Cape Verde archipelago, erupted for more than two months between November 2014 and February 2015. Voluminous and fast-moving lava flows were erupted from a linear fissure located at the base of Pico do Fogo cone and inundated the summit area of the volcano, destroying two villages.\nIn our work we first use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1A satellite, which had been operative for only a few weeks at the time of the onset of the eruption, to constrain the geometry of the intrusion that fed the eruption. The InSAR data was acquired in the TOPS (Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans) mode and the eruption at Fogo represents the first volcanic eruption imaged by Sentinel-1 in its standard acquisition mode. To accurately model TOPS data, variations in both incidence and squint angle of the satellite line-of-sight (LoS) vector need to be taken into account when projecting 3D displacements into the LoS direction. Following this approach, we perform a Bayesian inversion of the InSAR data and infer that the measured deformation is best explained by the intrusion of a sub-vertical dike beneath the southwestern flank of Pico do Fogo cone. This intrusion seems to have first propagated upwards beneath the cone and subsequently laterally towards the southwestern flank of Pico do Fogo, where it reached the surface.\nSuccessively, we evaluate differences between pre- and post-eruptive digital elevation models (DEMs) of the volcano to estimate the volume of the most recent lava flows. The DEMs are formed using synthetic aperture radar imagery from the TanDEM-X (TerraSAR add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) satellite mission and tri-stereo optical imagery from the Pléiades satellite constellation. Preliminary results show that during the 2014-2015 eruption almost 50 million cubic meters of lava were emplaced at the surface of the volcano over an area of ~5 square kilometers.",

            "abstract": "We present a new, complete ice thickness change reconstruction of the NE sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet for 1978-2014, partitioned into changes due to surface processes and ice dynamics. Elevation changes are computed from all available stereoscopic DEMs, and laser altimetry data (ICESat, ATM, LVIS). Surface Mass Balance and firn-compaction estimates are from RACMO2.3.\nOriginating nearly at the divide of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), the dynamically active North East Ice Stream (NEGIS) is capable of rapidly transmitting ice-marginal forcing far inland. Thus, NEGIS provides a possible mechanism for a rapid drawdown of ice from the ice sheet interior as marginal warming, thinning and retreat continues. Our altimetry record shows accelerating dynamic thinning of Zachariæ Isstrom, initially limited to the deepest part of the fjord near the calving front (1978-2000) and then extending at least 75 km inland. At the same time, changes over the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (N79) Glacier are negligible. We also detect localized large dynamic changes at higher elevations on the ice sheet. These thickness changes, often occurring at the onset of fast flow, could indicate rapid variations of basal lubrication due to rerouting of subglacial drainage.\nWe investigate the possible causes of the observed spatiotemporal pattern of ice sheet elevation changes using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). This work build on our previous studies examining the sensitivity of ice flow within the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) to key fields, including ice viscosity, basal drag. We assimilate the new altimetry record into ISSM to improve the reconstruction of basal friction and ice viscosity. Finally, airborne geophysical (gravity, magnetic) and ice-penetrating radar data is examined to identify the potential geologic controls on the ice thickness change pattern. Our study provides the first comprehensive reconstruction of ice thickness changes for the entire NEGIS drainage basin during the last 40 years. Through the use of ISSM, we examine possible mechanism explaining the observed changes. The improved understanding gained through this research will contribute better projections of future ice loss from this most vulnerable region of the GrIS.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is a harmful pollutant with adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. As well as these effects, tropospheric ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas, with an anthropogenic radiative forcing one quarter of that of CO2. Along with methane and atmospheric aerosol, tropospheric ozone belongs to the so-called Short Lived Climate forcing Pollutants, or SLCP. Recent work has shown that efforts to reduce concentrations of SLCP in the atmosphere have the potential to slow the rate of near-term climate change, while simultaneously improving public health and reducing crop losses. Unlike many other SLCP, tropospehric ozone is not directly emitted, but is instead influenced by two distinct sources: transport of air from the ozone-rich stratosphere; and photochemical production in the troposphere from the emitted precursors NOx (oxides of nitrogen), CO (Carbon Monoxide), and VOC (volatile organic compounds, including methane).\nBetter understanding of the relationship between ozone production and the emissions of its precursors is essential for the development of targeted emission reduction strategies. Several modeling methods have been employed to relate the production of tropospheric ozone to emissions of its precursors; emissions perturbation, tagging, and adjoint sensitivity methods all deliver complementary information about modelled ozone production. Most studies using tagging methods have focused on attribution of tropospheric ozone production to emissions of NOx, even though perturbation methods have suggested that tropospheric ozone is also sensitive to VOC, particularly methane.\nIn this study we describe the implementation into a global chemistry-climate model of a scheme for tagging emissions of NOx and VOC with an arbitrary number of labels, which are followed through the chemical reactions of tropospheric ozone production in order to perform attribution of tropospehric ozone to its emitted precursors. Attribution is performed to both geographical regions and to emission sectors. Source-receptor relationships are defined for intercontinental transport of ozone and its precursors, and the relative contributions of NOx, methane, CO, NMVOC, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange to tropospheric background ozone are determined.",

            "abstract": "Forest stand parameters, such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), or volume per hectare (V), are imperative for forest resources assessment. Traditional inventory of forest stand parameters, usually based on fieldwork, is often difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, to conduct in large areas. Therefore, estimating forest stand parameters in large areas using traditional inventory approach augmented by satellites data has a significant implication for sustainable forest management and natural resources efficiency. However, obtaining suitable satellite image data for such purpose is a challenging task mainly because of insignificant knowledge between the forest stand parameters and satellite spectral response relationships. Here, we present the use of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral responses data for augmenting forest stand parameter obtained from fieldwork at the Lahav Forest, in the Israeli Northern Negev. A new algorithm was developed in order to use all eight TM band when calculating the linear combination which correlates the most to each one of the forest stand parameters. Each linear combination is obtained first for local area inside the entire studied grid and is then fitted using a simple linear polynomial curve to the known forest stand parameter. Once the relationship between the two is characterized by a linear polynomial equation, the TM linear combination local area data is translated to the same equivalent area of the chosen forest stand parameter. At last, we interpolate the entire TM grid using a higher order polynomial fit applied to all the augmented local area combined together to attain full coverage of the desired forest stand parameter.",

Some of those mechanisms are\ndriven by alterations in ocean biogeochemical cycles. Hence, it is crucial to understand ocean\nbiogeochemistry dynamics during glacial-interglacial transitions. Within the German national\nclimate modeling initiative PalMod, aiming at simulating a full glacial cycle (135k – today) in\ntransient mode with a state-of-the-art Earth System Model (ESM), we address the ocean\nbiogeochemistry cycles using a comprehensive modeling approach.

This setup provides us a sophisticated\nrepresentation of the ocean biogeochemistry during the LGM without using any kind of datarestoring,\nto be consistent with the biological, chemical and physical dynamics of the model.\nWe analyze alterations in ocean biogeochemistry during the LGM in comparison to a preindustrial\ncontrol climate. We discuss and quantify the changes in ocean biogeochemical\ncycles between these two states, as well as possible implications for carbon transfer due to\nchanges in ocean dynamics. In the next steps we will use the ocean biogeochemistry model as\npart of the fully coupled MPI-ESM. Our results aim at improving the understanding of glacial\n– interglacial changes in atmospheric CO2, especially in terms of marine carbon sequestration\nand release.

            "abstract": "North Sea oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons, comprising liquid petroleum and natural gas, produced from petroleum reservoirs beneath the North Sea. As of January 2015, the North Sea is the world's most active offshore drilling region with 173 rigs drilling. During the summer of 2015, a series of survey flights took place on the UKs FAAM BAe 146 research aircraft with the primary aim to assess background methane (and other hydrocarbons) levels in the drilling areas of the North Sea. Also measured were Nitrogen Oxides (NO and NO2), which are emitted from almost all combustion processes and are a key air pollutant, both directly and as a precursor to ozone (O3). The oil and gas platforms in the North Sea are often manned and require significant power generation and support vessels for their continued operation, processes that potentially emit significant amounts of NOx into an otherwise relative clean environment. During these flights we were able to measure the NO­­­x (and any subsequently produced O3) emitted from specific rigs, as well as the NOx levels in the wider North Sea oil and gas production region (see figure for example). NOx mixing ratios of <10 ppbv were frequently observed in plumes, with significant perturbation to the wider North Sea background levels. NOx emissions from the rigs are point sources within the UKs National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI) and the measurements taken in plumes from individual rigs are used to assess the accuracy of these estimates.",

There have been severe water-related disasters recorded in Kyushu Island. On the other hand, because of high population density and for crop growth, water resource is an important issue of Kyushu Island.\nThe simulation of river discharge is important for water resource management and early warning of water-related disasters. This study attempts to apply H08 model to simulate river discharge in Kyushu Island. Geospatial meteorological and topographical data were obtained from Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The number of the observation stations of AMeDAS is limited and is not quite satisfactory for the application of water resources models in Kyushu. It is necessary to spatially interpolate the point data to produce grid dataset. Meteorological grid dataset is produced by considering elevation dependence. Solar radiation is estimated from hourly sunshine duration by a conventional formula. We successfully improved the accuracy of interpolated data just by considering elevation dependence and found out that the bias is related to geographical location. The rain/snow classification is done by H08 model and is validated by comparing estimated and observed snow rate. The estimates tend to be larger than the corresponding observed values. A system to automatically produce daily meteorological grid dataset is being constructed.The geospatial river network data were produced by ArcGIS and they were utilized in the H08 model to simulate the river discharge. Firstly, this research is to compare simulated and measured specific discharge, which is the ratio of discharge to watershed area. Significant error between simulated and measured data were seen in some rivers. Secondly, the outputs by the coupled model including crop growth module and reservoir operation module were analyzed. However, there are differences between the simulated value and measured value. We need to improve dam operation, artificial water intake, and parameters such as depth of the soil and flow velocity in the river.",

            "abstract": "Around the world, drought events with severe socio-economic impacts seem to have a link with winter snowpack. That is the case for the current California drought, but analysing historical archives and drought impact databases for the US and Europe we found many impacts that can be attributed to snowpack anomalies. Agriculture and electricity production (hydropower) were found to be the sectors that are most affected by drought related to snow.\nIn this study, we investigated the processes underlying hydrological drought in snow-dominated regions. We found that drought drivers are different in different regions. In Norway, more than 90% of spring streamflow droughts were preceded by below-average winter precipitation, while both winter air temperature and spring weather were indifferent. In Austria, however, spring streamflow droughts could only be explained by a combination of factors. For most events, winter and spring air temperatures were above average (70% and 65% of events, respectively), and winter and spring precipitation was below average (75% and 80%). Because snow storage results from complex interactions between precipitation and temperature and these variables vary strongly with altitude, snow-related drought drivers have a large spatial variability.\nThe weather input is subsequently modified by land properties. Multiple linear regression between drought severity variables and a large number of catchment characteristics for 44 catchments in Austria showed that storage influences both drought duration and deficit volume. The seasonal storage of water in snow and glaciers was found to be a statistically important variable explaining streamflow drought deficit.\nOur drought impact analysis in Europe also showed that 40% of the selected drought impacts was caused by a combination of snow-related and other drought types. For example, the combination of a winter drought with a preceding or subsequent summer drought was reported to have a large effect on reservoir levels and, consequently, on drinking water and electricity production. Snow storage therefore, is an important factor to consider in drought monitoring, prediction and management.",

Although numerous hydrological models exist, new approaches are still under investigation. In this context, we propose a new modelling approach based on the Physics Principle of Least Action. A first version of a Least Action based model, in its deterministic version has already given very good results on simulating the Bétérou catchment in the Ouémé basin, Benin. The paper presents new hypotheses to go further in the model development with a view of widening its application. The improved version of the model MODYPMA was applied on 22 subcatchments in Africa, in Bénin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia; in Europe, and in the USA. Its performance was compared to two well known lumped conceptual models, the GR4J and HBV models.\nThe model could be successfully calibrated and validated; it shows a good performance for a range of scales but a limited applicability to catchments smaller than 500 km2 . The analysis revealed that the three models have similar performance and timing errors. The parameter uncertainty was analysed using the GLUE methodology. It is concluded that model uncertainty is higher during high flows and that uncertainty analysis should include the uncertainty of the discharge data. Finally, some aspects that further research must address are brought out.",

            "abstract": "Land surface albedo is a key parameter for energy budgets. There are many available products from remote sensing sensors, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and so on.\nTheir accuracy should be carefully quantified before being used. Most validations directly use a single-point in situ measurement in the relatively homogeneous land surface. However, it is not valid over heterogeneous cases. A multi-scale validation strategy using a high-resolution albedo imagery as a bridge is alternative, with several uncertainties from high-spatial-resolution albedo imagery, geometric registration, and the upscaling process. It results a relative precision. Hence, for more effective validation, the albedo absolute value based on ground measurements is still required, which can be conceptualized as the “truth” value of pixel scale albedo.\nIn this study, a sampling strategy based on using wireless sensor network (WSN) technology to measure albedo at multiple nodes is proposed to capture the land surface heterogeneity in Huailai remote sensing test station, Hebei province, China, which is one station of a Chinese validation network (fig. 1).\nThe nodes are distributed in an optimal layout determined by a sequential selection method using theirs representativeness. The first six nodes with the highest degree of representativeness are finally selected (fig. 2). Upscaling functions with different weights for each node, calculated by the ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, are used to upscale them to a coarse pixel scale.\nApplication is exemplified by the validation of the MODIS albedo product (fig. 3), and VIIRS albedo product (fig.4), from Jul. 18, 2013 to Jul. 31, 2014. The RMSEs are 0.025 and 0.020 for MCD43B3 full inversion and magnitude inversion, respectively. The overall accuracy of VIIRS albedo is 0.021 and 0.014 under clear sky and strict clear sky, respectively.\nCompared with the multiple scale validation strategy, the WSN albedo “truth” at t pixel scale reveals a good quality both in stability and continuity. And this validation strategy has been one key element in the LAnd surface remote sensing Product VAlidation System (LAPVAS) in China.\n   ",

            "abstract": "Civil aviation contributes to degradation of air quality around airport (SOx, NOx, speciated hydrocarbons,…) and climate change through its emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, water vapor), as well as particulate matters. These particles include soot particles formed in the combustor, volatile aerosols and contrails generated in the aircraft wake.\nAlthough the aircraft emissions represent today only about 3% of all those produced on the surface of the earth by other anthropogenic sources, they are mostly released in the very sensitive region of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. These emissions have a radiative effect reinforced by specific physical and chemical processes at high altitudes, such as cloud formation and ozone production. In this context, most of the work to-date assessed that the actual effect of aviation on the climate are affected by very large uncertainties, partly due to lack of knowledge on the mechanisms of new particles formation and growth processes in the exhaust plume of the aircraft.\nThe engine exhaust gases are mixed in the ambient air under the influence of the interaction between the jet engine and the wing tip vortices. The characteristics of vortices as well as their interaction with the jet depend on the aircraft airframe especially on the wing geometry and the engine position (distance from the wing tip). The aim of this study is to examine the influence of aircraft parameters on contrail formation using a 3D CFD calculation based on a RANS (Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes) approach. Numerical simulations have been performed using CEDRE, the multiphysics ONERA code for energetics. CEDRE is a CFD code using finite volume methods and unstructured meshes. These meshes are especially appropriate when complex geometries are used. A transport model has been used for condensation of water vapor onto ice particles. Growth is evaluated using a modified Fick’s law to mass transfer on particles.\nIn this study, different aircraft configurations are analysed, a two-engine and a four-engine aircraft. The results show the influence on the engine location on the contrail formation in terms of size and distribution of ice particles in the near-field of the aircraft wake. Comparisons with reported observations in situ show a good agreement.",

Such information can be valuable for a country like India where 60% of agriculture is rain-fed. Here we evaluate precipitation and temperature forecast from the NCEP’s CFSV2 for seasonal drought prediction in India. We demonstrate the utility of the seasonal prediction of precipitation and temperature for drought forecast at 1-2 months lead time at a high spatial resolution. Precipitation from CFSv2 showed moderate correlations with observed up to two months lead. For one month lead, we found a significant correlation between CFSv2 and observed precipitation during winter season. Air temperature from the CFSv2 showed a good correlation with observed temperature during the winter. We forced the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with the CFSv2 forecast of precipitation and air temperature to generate forecast of hydrologic variables such as soil moisture and total runoff. We find that errors of the prediction reduce for the two month lead time in the majority of the study domain except the northern India. Skills of Initial Hydrologic Conditions combined with moderate skills of forcings based on the CFSv2 showed ability of drought prediction in India. The developed system was able to successfully predict observed top layer soil moisture and observed drought based on satellite remote sensing in India.",

            "abstract": "There is a first order contrast in compositional and thermal properties between cold and infertile Archean cratonic mantle and younger, warmer and more fertile Proterozoic lithosphere, but it has also become apparent that coherent thermal and compositional differences exist between adjacent Proterozoic terranes, even in regions that have been stable for over 1 Ga. We report new thermobarometry and in-situ trace element data for garnet peridotite xenoliths from several late Cretaceous (100-70 Ma) kimberlite localities in the western Namaqua-Natal Belt (NNB) and Rehoboth Province (RP), which bound the Archean Kaapvaal craton to the west and south, respectively. The localities include some for which no data have been reported previously. Re-depletion model ages from Os isotopes indicate that the lithosphere beneath the NNB and RP is mainly Early Proterozoic (Pearson et al., Chem. Geol., 2004; Janney et al. J. Petrol., 2010) and there is no evidence from xenolith modal proportions for significant differences in average fertility between lithospheric terranes. Equilibration pressures for garnet peridotites from both terranes fall in a similar range (2 to 5 GPa). However, peridotites from the RP typically have P and T values that fall on or very close to the Kaapvaal cratonic geotherm (apart from a group of peridotites from the Gibeon kimberlites with pressures > 4 GPa that follow an adiabatic gradient; e.g. Franz et al., J. Geol., 1996) whereas peridotites from the western NNB have temperatures roughly 100°C warmer than the cratonic geotherm over the whole depth range. Peridotites from the 140 Ma Melton Wold kimberlite, also in the western NNB, lack these warmer temperatures and suggest that warming was contemporaneous with Late Cretaceous kimberlite magmatism. Metasomatic enrichment in incompatible elements (consistent with interaction with kimberlitic melts) is more pronounced in NNB as compared to RP peridotites. The association of higher temperatures with a greater extent of metasomatic interaction in the NNB peridotites suggests that the two phenomena are related and may indicate pervasive thermal resetting of the NNB mantle lithosphere concurrent with Late Cretaceous kimberlite magmatism, whereas the RP appears to have largely escaped this, except for local infiltration of the lithosphere at depth.",

            "abstract": "A significant number of P and S wave tomography models have been produced in the past decade using various subsets of data from the Earthscope USArray and different inversion algorithms. We focus here on published tomography results that span large portions of the final footprint of the USArray. We use 3D visualization techniques to search for common features in different tomography models. We also compare tomography results to features seen in our current generation wavefield images. Recent innovations of our plane wave migration method have yielded what is arguably the highest resolution image ever produced of the mantle in the vicinity of the transition zone. The new results reveal a rich collection of coherent, dipping structures seen throughout the upper mantle and transition zone. These dipping interfaces are judged significant according to a coherence metric. We treat these surfaces as strain markers to assess proposed models for geometry of the 3D geometry of the Farallon Slab under North America. We find the following geologic interpretations are well supported by independent results: 1. The old Farallon under eastern North America and below the base of transition zone is universally seen as a high velocity anomaly. 2. All results support a simple, 3D kinematic model of the updip limit of the Farallon slab window that follows a track from Cape Mendocino, across Nevada, and northern Arizona and New Mexico. 3. All models show a strong low-velocity mantle under the southwestern U.S. 4. A low-velocity features is universally seen related to the Yellowstone-Snake River system. Shorter wavelength features observed in different tomography models are inconsistent showing that the theme of this session is very important to understand what features are in current results are real. Isopach maps of the thickness of the transition show a systematic difference in transition zone thickness in the western and eastern US. The transition zone thickens in the eastern US in the region tomography models have interpreted as the old Farallon slab . We find that the transition zone thickness under the high plains is comparable to the western US and there are hints of a series of east dipping interfaces. We suggest these may be markers of modern upwelling process or a frozen relic of flat slab subduction during the Laramide orogeny.",

The higher resolution makes it possible to accurately monitor much smaller water bodies than previously. In this study, which is part of the FP7 project Land and Ocean take up from Sentinel-3 (LOTUS), we investigate the potential of SAR altimetry. To derive lake levels we use novel empirical threshold retrackers and the physical SAMOSA retracker. We consider lakes at various sizes and evaluate the CryoSat-2 derived lake levels in terms of along-track precision and agreement with in-situ data. We find that the precision of the along-track mean water level is a few cm, even for lakes with a surface area of just 9 km^2. The high precision makes it possible to detect water level variations below the decimeter level. To derive lake level time series we apply a state-space model with a robust handling of erroneous data. Instead of attempting to identify and remove the polluted observations we use a mixture distribution to describe the observation noise, which prevents the polluted observations from biasing our final reconstructed time series.\nThese results demonstrate the promising possibilities of the upcoming Sentinel-3 mission, which potentially will be able to provide accurate time series for small lakes.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet has been mapped by radar altimetry since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991, which was followed by ERS-2, Envisat and currently CryoSat-2. For the period 2003-2009 the ice sheet topography was also mapped by laser altimetry by the ICESat mission.\nHere, we apply suitable elevation change algorithms to radar data from ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat, and CryoSat-2 data, with the goal to derive continuous, ice sheet-wide elevation changes for the period 1992 to 2015. This analysis has been made possible through the recent release of data from the REAPER project, in which ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar have been reprocessed in a consistent way to that used for Envisat data.\nOver this 23-year period, the pattern of elevation changes varies significantly. Whilst thickening and thinning can both be observed during different periods, the overall trend of the elevation of the ice sheet is negative, i.e. an overall lowering can be seen during the two decades studied. This work is part of the ESA Greenland Ice Sheet CCI project.\nWe compare elevation changes derived from radar and laser altimetry (2003-09) and find a complex pattern of difference between the two sensor types, and we explain how some of this pattern can be explained by changes in firn compaction and accumulation rates, obtained from a regional climate model and an offline firn model. Also we show how this pattern changes if using differently retracked Envisat data.\nA special focus will be on results obtained from the CryoSat-2 measurements that provide radar heights of unprecedented coverage and resolution. Here we present the results of a validation exercise carried out as part of the ESA-funded CryoVAL-LI project in which the accuracy of the CryoSat-2 measurements of land ice is assessed.\nThe results presented here signify an important milestone in measuring the surface elevation of the ice sheet: providing us with an insight into past as well as recent changes, providing up-to-date information on the behaviour and evolution of the ice, and hence associated sea level alterations.",

            "abstract": "Indian Sundarban lies in the south-western part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and supports a 4.43 million strong population. The agrarian economy of Sundarban is dominated by rainfed subsistence rice farming. Unavailability of upstream fresh water, high salinity of river water of up to 32ppt, soil salinity ranging between 2dSm-1 to 19dSm-1, small land holdings of per capita 840 sq. metre and inadequate irrigation facilities are serious constraints for agricultural production in Sundarban. This paper assesses Cropping Intensity, Irrigation Intensity and Man-Cropland Ratio from Agriculture Census (2010-11) data and estimates the seasonal water demand for agriculture in different blocks of Sundarban.\nThe research exposes the ever increasing population pressure on agriculture with an average Man Cropland Ratio of 1745 person/sq.km. In 2010-2011, the average cropping intensity was 129.97% and the irrigation intensity was 20.40%. The highest cropping and irrigation intensity have been observed in the inland blocks where shallow ground water is available for agriculture on the contrary, the lowest values have been observed in the southern blocks, due to existence of saline shallow ground water. The annual water demand for agriculture in Sundarban has been estimated as 2784 mcm. Available water from 70000 freshwater tanks and around 8000 numbers of shallow tube wells are not sufficient to meet the agricultural water demand. Existing irrigation sources and rainfall of 343 mcm fall far short of the water demand of 382 mcm during peak dry Season. Unavailability of fresh water restricts the food production, which endangers the food security of 87.5% of the people in Sundarban. To ensure the food security in changing climatic condition, expansion of irrigation network and harnessing of new water sources are essential. Large scale rainwater harvesting, rejuvenation and re-connection of disconnected river channels, artificial recharge within shallow aquifer to bring down its salinity can be some of the major policy options to meet the water demand for agriculture in Sundarban.",

The atmospheric chemistry-climate model EMAC has been used at about 50 km grid spacing on global scale, applying an online dust emission scheme and calcium as a proxy for dust reactivity. EMAC includes a detailed tropospheric chemistry mechanism, aerosol microphysics and thermodynamics schemes to describe dust \"aging''. The model is evaluated using ground-based observations for aerosol concentrations and aerosol optical depth, LIDAR as well as satellite observations. Simulation results and back trajectory analysis show that the development of synoptic disturbances over the EM can enhance dust transport from the Sahara and Arabian deserts in frontal systems that also carry air pollution to the EM. The frontal systems are associated with precipitation that control the dust removal. Our results show the importance of chemical aging of dust, which increases particles size, dust deposition and scavenging efficiency during transport, overall reducing the life-time relative to non-aged dust particles. The relatively long travel periods of Saharan dust result in more sustained aging compared to Arabian dust. Sensitivity simulations indicate three times more dust deposition of aged relative to pristine dust, which significantly decreases the dust lifetime and loading.",

Channel systems incise the lower continental rise, but in most cases they are inherited features formed as channel-levee turbiditic systems during past, more temperate times.\nThe Hillary Canyon cuts the eastern Ross Sea continental slope and rise, to the Southeast of the Iselin Bank, and is directly connected to the Glomar Challenger Trough on the continental shelf. Cold dense salty water forms today in the Ross Sea polynya, spreads below the Ross Ice Shelf, becomes supercooled, fills up the landward deepening Glomar Challenger Trough and then spills over the sill of the shelf edge and flows downslope, often along the Hillary Canyon, in a geostrophic way, deviated westwards by the Coriolis Force, but sometimes also with a cascading a-geostrophic behaviour. This supercold water signal was found on the continental slope down to 1200 m depth. The shape of this tongue of modified ISW, whose thickness reaches up to 100 m, is very narrow, suggesting that the overflow occurs in very localized areas along the slope.\nHere we combine seismic stratigraphy analysis of multichannel seismic reflection profiles, box and gravity cores in the Hillary Canyon and along the eastern flank of the Iselin Bank, with seabed bathymetry and numerical modelling of thevertical and spatial distribution of the water masses, in order to identify modern and past pathways of the Ross Sea Bottom Water current.\nThe results of this work show that the Hillary Canyon and the sediment mounds that formed along its flanks have been active since early Miocene times. Sediment drift-moat features and sediment waves are indicative of strong Northwest bottom currents reworking the seabed sediments at different water depths along the slope, possibly since the late Miocene. These sediment drifts are some of the targets of the IODP proposal 751-full.",

Ozone reached the maximum and minimum concentration at 15:00 and 07:00, respectively. The monthly mean concentration of O3 was the highest in June, which was in accordance with the highest concentration of isoprene and monoterpenes and maximum PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation). NOx was transported from nearby highway mostly in the morning, which fueled O3 formation. At Taehwa Research Forest, it was well constrained the evolution of biogenic VOCs mixed with urban emission and their impact on O3.\n ",

We use moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 250 m resolution for monitoring temporal changes in irrigation and cropping patterns in India. We used the obtained dataset of cropping pattern for quantifying the effect of irrigation on land surface states and fluxes by using an uncoupled land surface model. The cropping patterns are derived by using the planting, heading, harvesting, and growing dates for each agro-ecological zone separately. Moreover, we developed a high resolution irrigated area maps for the period of 1999-2014 for India. The high resolution irrigated area was compared with relatively coarse resolution (~ 10km) irrigated area from the Food and Agricultural Organization. To identify the seasonal effects we analyzed the spatial and temporal change of irrigation and cropping pattern for different temporal seasons. The new irrigation area information along with cropping pattern was used to study the water budget in India using the Noah Land surface Model (Noah LSM) for the period of 1999-2014.",

            "abstract": "Precision farming refers to field-specific management of an agricultural crop at a spatial scale with an aim to get the highest achievable yield and to achieve this spatial information on field variability is essential. The difficulty in mapping of spatial variability occurring within an agriculture field can be revealed by employing spectral techniques in hyperspectral imagery rather than multispectral imagery. However an advanced algorithm needs to be developed to fully make use of the rich information content in hyperspectral data. In the present study, potential of hyperspectral data acquired from space platform was examined to map the field variation of paddy crop and its species discrimination. This high dimensional data comprising 242 spectral narrow bands with 30m ground resolution Hyperion L1R product acquired for Assam, India (30th Sept and 3rd Oct, 2014) were allowed for necessary pre-processing steps followed by geometric correction using Hyperion L1GST product. Finally an atmospherically corrected and spatially deduced image consisting of 112 band was obtained. By employing an advanced clustering algorithm, 12 different clusters of spectral waveforms of the crop were generated from six paddy fields for each images. The findings showed that, some clusters were well discriminated representing specific rice genotypes and some clusters were mixed treating as a single rice genotype. As vegetation index (VI) is the best indicator of vegetation mapping, three ratio based VI maps were also generated and unsupervised classification was performed for it. The so obtained 12 clusters of paddy crop were mapped spatially to the derived VI maps. From these findings, the existence of heterogeneity was clearly captured in one of the 6 rice plots (rice plot no. 1) while heterogeneity was observed in rest of the 5 rice plots. The degree of heterogeneous was found more in rice plot no.6 as compared to other plots. Subsequently, spatial variability of paddy field was observed in different plot levels in the paddy fields from the two images. However, no such significant variation in rice genotypes at growth level was observed. Hence, the spectral information acquired from space platform can be linearly scaled to map the variation in field levels of rice crop which will be act as an informative system for rice agriculture practice.",

            "abstract": "Design water levels for coastal structures are usually estimated on the basis of extreme value statistics. Since their robustness heavily depends on the sample size of heuristic observations there is an urgent need of regular statistical updates especially after the occurrence of record high extreme events. Here we demonstrate the exceptional influence of such an event based on storm Xaver which brought record high extremes for large parts of the southwestern German North Sea coastline on December 6th 2013. We show that the estimates of an event occurring once in 200 years increased by roughly 30 cm due to the update after Xaver, a value 1.5 times larger than the entire 20th century sea level rise in the region. However, a thorough analysis of different independent meteorological (winds and pressure) and oceanographic components (tides, surges, mean sea level anomalies) driving the event also indicates that their observed combination still does not represent the physically possible worst case scenario. Neither tides nor surges and mean sea level anomalies were at their observational maximum, suggesting that there is a realistic risk of storms bringing even up to a few decimeter higher extremes just under present day conditions without any influence of future global warming. The results question purely statistical design approaches neglecting the physical boundary conditions of individual extreme events.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tōhoku tsunami caused a high number of fatalities and massive destruction. Data collected after the event allow for retrospective analyses. Since 2009, NGI has developed a generic GIS model for local analyses of tsunami vulnerability and mortality risk. The mortality risk convolves the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The hazard is represented by the maximum tsunami flow depth (with a corresponding likelihood), the exposure is described by the population density in time and space, while the vulnerability is expressed by the probability of being killed as a function of flow depth and building class. The analysis is further based on high-resolution DEMs.\nNormally a certain tsunami scenario with a corresponding return period is applied for vulnerability and mortality risk analysis. Hence, the model was first employed for a tsunami forecast scenario affecting Bridgetown, Barbados, and further developed in a forecast study for the city of Batangas in the Philippines. Subsequently, the model was tested by hindcasting the 2009 South Pacific tsunami in American Samoa. This hindcast was based on post-tsunami information. The GIS model was adapted for optimal use of the available data and successfully estimated the degree of mortality.\nFor further validation and development, the model was recently applied in the RAPSODI project for hindcasting the 2011 Tōhoku tsunami in Sendai and Ishinomaki. With reasonable choices of building vulnerability, the estimated expected number of fatalities agree well with the reported death toll. The results of the mortality hindcast for the 2011 Tōhoku tsunami substantiate that the GIS model can help to identify high tsunami mortality risk areas, as well as identify the main risk drivers.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from CONCERT-Japan Joint Call on Efficient Energy Storage and Distribution/Resilience against Disasters (http://www.concertjapan.eu; project RAPSODI  - Risk Assessment and design of Prevention Structures fOr enhanced tsunami DIsaster resilience http://www.ngi.no/en/Project-pages/RAPSODI/), and from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, STrategy And Risk reduction for Tsunamis in Europe http://www.astarte-project.eu/).",

            "abstract": "Recurrence interval (RI) for successive earthquakes on individual faults is recorded by paleoseismic datasets for surface-rupturing earthquakes which, in New Zealand, have magnitudes of >Mw ~6 to 7.2 depending on the thickness of the brittle crust. New Zealand faults examined have mean RI of ~130 to 8500 yrs, with an upper bound censored by the sample duration (<30 kyr) and an inverse relationship to fault slip rate. Frequency histograms, probability density functions (PDFs) and coefficient of variation (CoV= standard deviation/arithmetic mean) values have been used to quantify RI variability for geological and simulated earthquakes on >100 New Zealand active faults. RI for individual faults can vary by more than an order of magnitude. CoV of RI for paleoearthquake data comprising 4-10 events ranges from ~0.2 to 1 with a mean of 0.6±0.2. These values are generally comparable to simulated earthquakes (>100 events per fault) and suggest that RI ranges from quasi periodic (e.g., ~0.2-0.5) to random (e.g., ~1.0). Comparison of earthquake simulation and paleoearthquake data indicates that the mean and CoV of RI can be strongly influenced by sampling artefacts including; the magnitude of completeness, the dimensionality of spatial sampling and the duration of the sample period. Despite these sampling issues RI for the best of the geological data (i.e. >6 events) and earthquake simulations are described by log-normal or Weibull distributions with long recurrence tails (~3 times the mean) and provide a basis for quantifying real RI variability (rather than sampling artefacts). Our analysis indicates that CoV of RI is negatively related to fault slip rate. These data are consistent with the notion that fault interaction and associated stress perturbations arising from slip on larger faults are more likely to advance or retard future slip on smaller faults than visa versa.",

All sites from the Eifel had been previously dated, whereas the ages of the El Hierro flows were approximated by stratigraphic and directional coherency with a dated section c. 4 km to the north-east. Additionally, seven flows were dated using the ThermoFisher Helix multi-collector mass spectrometer at VU University Amsterdam (the Netherlands). The rocks were subjected to standard rock magnetic and palaeomagnetic experiments. Palaeodirections were obtained using both thermal and alternating-field demagnetisation techniques. Apart from two sites that appear to have been struck by lightning, all sites yielded reliable palaeodirections. Absolute palaeointensities were obtained using three different methods: IZZI-Thellier, the multispecimen protocol and the calibrated pseudo-Thellier technique. Nineteen sites from El Hierro and all twelve sites from the Eifel passed the selection criteria for one or more of these methods, with the pseudo-Thellier technique having the highest success rate (c. 35% for El Hierro and 55% for the Eifel). The palaeointensities obtained for El Hierro were mostly between 20 and 40 μT and for the Eifel between 20 and 50 μT, both with a tendency to be somewhat low compared to the present-day field of c. 39 μT and c. 49 μT, respectively. The pseudo-Thellier and multispecimen methods generally yielded lower palaeointensities than IZZI-Thellier, but no clear trend was visible.",

Following this event, a damaging tsunami was induced and hit the Island Gizo where the capital city of Western Province of Solomon Islands located. Several buildings of this city were destroyed and several peoples lost their lives during this earthquake. However, during this earthquake, no near source seismic instrument has been installed in this region. The seismic evaluations for the aftershock sequence, the possible earthquake early warning and tsunami warning were unavailable. For the purpose of knowing more detailed information about seismic activity in this region, we have installed 9 seismic stations (with Trillium 120PA broadband seismometer and Q330S 24bit digitizer) around the rupture zone of the 2007 earthquake since September of 2009. Within a decade, it has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the Green’s function or impulse response between two seismic stations can be retrieved from the cross-correlation of ambient noise. In this study, 6 stations’ observations which are more complete during 2011/10 ~ 2012/12 period, were selected for the purpose of the cross-correlation analysis of ambient seismic noise. The group velocities at period 2-20 seconds of 15 station-pairs were extracted by using multiple filter technique (MFT) method. The analyzed results of this study presented significant results of group velocities with higher frequency contents than other studies (20-60 seconds in usually cases) and opened new opportunities to study the shallow crustal structure of the western Solomon Islands.",

In an attempt to elucidate the differences of active and non-active segments of the fault, this report discusses the results of observation of fault outcrops along the Shionohira Fault as well as the Coulomb stress calculations.\nOnly a few outcrops have basement rocks of both the hanging-wall and foot-wall of the fault plane. Three of these outcrops (Kyodo-gawa, Shionohira and Betto) were selected for investigation. In addition, a fault outcrop (Nameishi-minami) located about 300 m south of the southern tip of the surface ruptures was investigated. The authors carried out observations of outcrops, polished slabs and thin sections, and performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) to fault materials. \nAs a result, the fault zones originating from schists were investigated at Kyodo-gawa and Betto. A thick fault gouge was cut by a fault plane of the 4.11 earthquake in each outcrop. The fault materials originating from schists were fault bounded with (possibly Neogene) weakly deformed sandstone at Shionohira. A thin fault gouge was found along the fault plane of 4.11 earthquake. A small-scale fault zone with thin fault gouge was observed in Nameishi-minami. According to XRD analysis, smectite was detected in the gouges from Kyodo-gawa, Shionohira and Betto, while not in the gouge from Nameishi-minami.",

            "abstract": "Since 2011, the ARTEMIS 1 and 2 spacecraft have been taking observations in the solar wind and magnetotail as they orbit around the Moon at ~60 Re. With state-of-the-art magnetic field and plasma instruments, they perform the first systematic, two-point observations of the mid-to-distant tail, including an opportunity to study the detailed structure of the mid-to-distant tail. In this study, we study the plasma flow within the magnetotail at -60 Re and its variations in response to the changes in IMF and solar wind. We bin 17 months of 34 single trajectory passes of the ARTEMIS spacecraft to create the vector maps of the plasma flow. After several coordinate transformations, vector maps were constructed on different planes, xy-, xz-, and yz, in aberrated solar wind corrected GSM (aSWGSM) coordinates, and thanks to good orbital coverage of the spacecraft, entire plasma sheet was mapped completely, especially on the dawn side. The dominant flow is tailward. The magnitude of the flow in the xy plane does not change much throughout the width of the magnetotail. The flow components on the yz plane are much smaller than in the xy plane. Deviations from the average pattern are also noteworthy. One of the few localized flow reversals was found to be associated with high speed flows in the solar wind resulting from a CME passage and a strong substorm event. Vector maps are separated with respect to the IMF orientation and compared with MHD model results. Magnetic field patterns corresponding to the flow patterns are also performed and reveal the expected dipolar field topology at -60 Re. We discuss our findings on the general structure and selected special cases from the magnetotail dynamic point of view and in comparison with those from MHD models as well as earlier spacecraft missions.",

            "abstract": "The presence of the Moon leads the Earth to precess, which forces a flow in its outer core via the spheroidal Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB). Reciprocally, this is also true for the liquid core core of the Moon, but the CMB is rather a triaxial ellipsoid in this case.\nIn this work, we investigate if the precession can force two different stable flows for the same control parameters, allowing then the core to switch from one state to the other in presence of noise (convection, turbulence, etc.). To do so, we systematically study the parameter ranges where the well-known equations obtained by Busse (1968 J. Fluid Mech. 33 739–51) lead to multiple solutions. Then, using the models recently proposed by Noir and Cébron (2013 J. Fluid Mech. 737 412–39), which are more generic in the inviscid limit than the equations of Busse, we analytically describe these multiple solutions, their conditions of existence, and their stability. We also report for the first time the theoretical possibility that time-dependent multiple flows can coexist in precessing triaxial ellipsoids (such as the liquid core of the Moon).\nFinally, using the formula we have derived from pre-existent models of the literature, we conclude that the Earth and the Moon do not undergo such a bistable flow forced by precession. However, according to the models of the literature, such a bistable precession forced state exists for geophysically relevant ranges of parameters, and is thus always possible a priori in precessing liquid cores of terrestrial bodies.",

            "abstract": "Within the soil-plant-atmosphere system, root activity plays a fundamental role, as it connects different domains and allows a large part of the water and nutrient exchanges necessary for plant sustenance. The understanding of these processes is not only useful from an environmental point of view, making a fundamental contribution to the understanding of the critical zone dynamics, but also plays a pivotal role in precision agriculture, where the optimisation of water resources exploitation is mandatory and often carried out through deficit irrigation techniques. In this work, we present the results of non-invasive monitoring of the active root zone of two orange trees (Citrus sinensis, cv Tarocco Ippolito) located in an orange orchard in eastern Sicily (Italy) and drip irrigated with two different techniques: partial root drying and 100% crop evapotranspiration. The main goal of the monitoring activity is to assess possible differences between the developed root systems and the root water uptake between the two irrigation strategies. The monitoring is conducted using 3D micro-electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) based on an apparatus composed of a number of micro-boreholes (about 1.2 m deep) housing 12 electrodes each, plus a number of surface electrodes. Time-lapse measurements conducted both with long-term periodicity and short-term repetition before and after irrigation clearly highlight the presence and distribution of root water uptake zone both at shallow and larger depth, likely to correspond to zones utilized during the irrigation period (shallow) and during the time when the crop is not irrigated (deep). Subsidiary information is available in terms of precipitation, sap flow measurements and micrometeorological evapotranspiration estimates. This data ensemble lends itself to the assimilation into a variably saturated flow model, where both soil hydraulic parameters and root distribution shall be identified. Preliminary results in this directions show the potential of the method and its exciting outlook.",

Chang’E-3 craft composed of a lander and a rover, and each of them carry four scientific payloads respectively. The landing site of Chang’E-3 was located at 44.12 degrees north latitude and 19.51 degrees west longitude, where is in the northern part of Imbrium Which the distance in its west direction from the landing site of former Soviet probe Luna-17 is about 400 km, and about 780km far from the landing site of Appolo-17 in its southeast direction. Unfortunately, after a series of scientific tests and exploration on the surface of the moon, the motor controller communication of the rover emerged a breakdown on January 16, 2014, which leaded the four payloads onboard the rover can’t obtain data anymore. However, we have received some interesting scientific data which have been studied by Chinese scientists. During the landing process of Chang’E-3, the Landing camera got total 4673 images with the Resolution in millimeters to meters, and the lander and rover took pictures for each other at different point with Topography camera and Panoramic camera. We can find characteristic changes in celestial brightness with time by analyzing image data from Lunar-based Ultraviolet Telescope (LUT) and an unprecedented constraint on water content in the sunlit lunar exosphere seen by LUT). The figure observed by EUV camera (EUVC) shows that there is a transient weak area of the Earth‘s plasma sphere; This event took place about three hours. The scientists think that it might be related to the change of the particle density of mid-latitude ionosphere. The preliminary spectral and mineralogical results from the landing site are derived according to the data of Visible and Near-infrared Imaging Spectrometer (VNIS). Seven major elements including Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti and Fe have been identified by the Active Particle-induced X-ay Spectrometer (APXS). The observations of Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) have revealed the con-figuration of regolith where the thickness of regolith varies from about 4m to 6m, and on layer of lunar rock was detected, which is about 330m deep and might have been accumulated during the depositional hiatus of mare basalts.",

            "abstract": "Introduction and methods\nFluvial disturbance is a key driver of riparian vegetation dynamics in river corridors. Despite an increasing understanding of ecohydraulic interactions between plants and fluvial forces, the interactive influences of plant morphology and sediment supply on plant mortality, a key demographic factor, are largely unknown. To better understand these processes, we designed and conducted a series of flume experiments to: (1) quantify effects of plant traits that interact with flow and sediment transport on plant loss to scour during floods; and (2) predict plant dislodgement for different species across a range of plant sizes, patch densities, and sediment condition (equilibrium transport versus sediment deficit). We ran ten experimental floods in a 28 m long × 0.6 m wide × 0.71 m tall flume, using live, 1–3 year-old tamarisk and cottonwood seedlings with contrasting morphologies with varied combinations of size and density.\nResults and discussion\nBoth sediment supply and plant traits (morphology and composition) have significant impacts on plant vulnerability during floods. Sediment deficit resulted in bed degradation and a 35% greater risk of plant loss compared to equilibrium sediment conditions. The probability of plant dislodgement in sparse patches was 4.5 times greater than in dense patches. Tamarisk plants and patches had greater frontal area, basal diameter and longer roots compared to cottonwood across all seedling heights. These traits, as well as its lower crown position reduced tamarisk’s vulnerability to scour by 75%. Compared with cottonwood, tamarisk exhibits better resistance to floods, due to its greater root biomass and longer roots that stabilize soil, and its greater frontal area and lower crown that effectively trap sediment. These traits likely contribute to riverscape-scale changes in channel morphology that are evident where tamarisk has invaded native riparian communities, and explain the persistence of tamarisk species on regulated rivers where catastrophic floods have been reduced.",

            "abstract": "Rifting of continental lithosphere requires a mechanism to reduce lithospheric thickness from 100–150 kilometers to close to zero kilometers at the point of rupture. At magma-poor continental margins, this has long-thought to be caused by uniform stretching and thinning of the lithosphere accompanied by passive upwelling of the asthenosphere [1]. For the last thirty years depth-dependent thinning has been proposed as an alternative to this model to explain the anomalously shallow environment of deposition along many continental margins [2, 3]. A critical prediction of this modification is that the lower crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle undergo a phase of increased heat flow, potentially accompanied by heating, during thinning of the lithospheric mantle. Here, we test this prediction by applying recently developed U-Pb age depth profiling techniques [4] to lower crustal accessory minerals from the exhumed Alpine Tethys and Pyrenean margins. Inversion of diffusion-controlled U-Pb age profiles in rutile affords the opportunity to trace the thermal evolution of the lower crust through the rifting process. Resultant thermal histories are used to calculate thinning factors of the crust and lithospheric mantle by 2D thermo-kinematic models of extending lithosphere. Combined, we use the measured and modeled thermal histories to propose a mechanism to explain the initiation and growth of lithospheric instabilities that lead to depth-dependent thinning at magma-poor continental margins.\n[1] McKenzie, D.

The development of in-situ, high-resolution monitoring equipment has revolutionised our capability to capture flow and water quality data at a sub-hourly resolution, enabling us to potentially enhance our understanding of hydrochemical variations from contrasting landscapes during storm events. During the winter of 2013/2014, the United Kingdom experienced a succession of intense storm events, where the south of the country experienced 200% of the average rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding across the Thames basin. We applied high-frequency (15 minute resolution) water quality monitoring across ten contrasting subcatchments (including rural, urban and mixed land-use catchments), seeking to classify the disparity in water quality conditions both within- and between events. Rural catchments increasingly behave like “urban” catchments as soils wet up and become increasingly responsive to subsequent events, however water quality response during the winter months remains limited. By contrast, increasingly urban catchments yield greater contaminant loads during events, and pre-event baseline chemistry highlights a resupply source in dense urban catchments. Wastewater treatment plants were shown to dominate baseline chemistry during low-flow events but also yield a considerable impact on stormwater outputs during peak-flow events, as hydraulic push results in the outflow of untreated solid wastes into the river system. Results are discussed in the context of water quality policy; urban growth scenarios and BMP for stormwater runoff in contrasting landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Advances in our understanding of Earth's thermal evolution and the style of mantle convection rely on robust constraints on the distribution of radiogenic heating in the mantle. If the Earth were derived from chondritic meteorites, its mantle must have an isolated, chemically distinct reservoir enriched in heat-producing elements, presumably present at the base of the mantle. Direct assessment of mantle radioactivity through the observations of geoneutrinos has the potential to detect this missing reservoir in the deep mantle.\nOne potential location of this reservoir would be the two Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific, which stand out in every global map of the Earth's lower mantle. Whole Earth oscillations, or normal modes, are key to determining the large scale density variations in the mantle and to test models of the origin, composition and longevity of the LLSVPs. Here, we show that anomalous splitting of Stoneley modes, a unique class of free oscillations that are perturbed primarily by velocity and density variations at the core-mantle boundary, are optimally fit when the density of the LLSVPs is lower than the surrounding material. We hypothesise that these low-velocity, low-density structures in the lower mantle are extremely hot due to the high concentration of heat-producing elements. Ensuing geoneutrino research will test this hypothesis by mapping the regional distribution of U and Th in the deep mantle, especially in the oceans.",

The aim of which is to facilitate the dynamic controlled management of scientific data through its lifecycle. While processes are considered they are not statically defined but rather driven by human interactions in the form of risk management/review procedure that produce actionable plans, which are responsive to change.\nWe then proceed by describing the feasibility testing of extended risk management and planning procedures which integrate current practices. This was done through the CEDA Archival Format Audit which inspected British Atmospheric Data Centre and NERC Earth Observation Data Centre Archival holdings. These holdings are extensive, comprising of around 2 Petabytes of data and 137 million individual files, which were analysed and characterised in terms of format, based risk. We are then able to present an overview of the format based risk burden faced by a large scale archive attempting to maintain the usability of heterogeneous environmental data sets\nWe continue by presenting a dynamic data management information model and provide discussion of the following core model entities and their relationships:\nAspirational entities, which include Data Entity definitions and their associated Preservation Objectives.\nRisk entities, which act as drivers for change within the data lifecycle. These include Acquisitional Risks, Technical Risks, Strategic Risks and External Risks\nPlan entities, which detail the actions to bring about change within an archive.

Understanding a transport mechanism of UFBs in soils is essential to optimize remediation techniques using UFBs. In this study, column transport experiments using glass beads with different size fraction were conducted, where UFBs created by either air or oxygen were injected to the column with different flow conditions. Effects of particle size and flow velocities on transport characteristics of UFBs were investigated based on the column experiments. The results showed that attachments of UFBs were enhanced under lower water velocity condition, exhibiting more than 50% of UFBs injected were attached inside the column. The mobility of O2-UFBs which have lower zeta potential was higher than that of Air-UFBs. A convection-dispersion model including bubble attachment and detachment terms was applied to the obtained breakthrough curves for each experiment, showing good fitness against the measured data.",

            "abstract": "Rock’s electrical properties can be changed by mechanical action, especially when deformation is accompanied by micro-fracturing processes. Knowing how electrical charge is generated in inelastically deformed rocks, the nature and properties of the generated charge carriers, and their spatial distribution and propagation is crucial to gain insight into the origin of seismo-electromagnetic signals. In this work, we describe briefly a model for the numerical simulation of electrical transport in rocks under mechanical action, assuming that high and low mobility charge carriers of opposite signs can be simultaneously generated by micro-fracturing processes and recombine, diffuse and drift across the sample rock. The electrical behavior can then be described using an adaptation of the formalism applied to semiconductors. We provide simulation results on a one-dimensional lattice using finite-difference discretization. Our results show that a large mobility contrast among charge carriers allows charge separation inside the deformation region, which leads to the formation of charged layers of alternate signs. Inside these layers, rapid electric field variations are observed which can lead to the emission of electromagnetic radiation. With proper positioning of current electrodes inside the deformation region, it is possible to collect electrical current even without any applied voltage. We discuss our results in the light of available experimental results on the generation of electrical and electromagnetic signals in deformed rocks.",

Lower viscosity Archean komatiites ascended rapidly, producing lava channels (e.g., Kambalda) and subvolcanic feeder sills (e.g., Mt. Keith). Higher viscosity Proterozoic komatiitic basalts/ferropicrites/picrites had more difficulty ascending through the crust and produced subvolcanic feeder dikes (e.g., Eagle-Tamarack, Voisey’s Bay) and sills (e.g., Thompson, Pechenga) and fewer lava channels (e.g., Raglan). Phanerozoic picrites/basalts produced mainly dikes (e.g., Kalatongke) and feeder sills (e.g., Noril’sk, Jinchuan). All were capable of eroding S-rich substrates/wall rocks and generating magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. Some chromite deposits appear to have formed in channelized magmatic systems, and although typically finer-grained chromite is much easier to transport than typically larger sulfide melt droplets, almost all known volcanic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits formed during lava emplacement and no volcanic chromite deposits have yet been identified. This suggests that Fe-Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfides and chromite are more easily transported horizontally within sills and lava channels, but less easily transported vertically. If magmatic Fe-Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits can form by partial melting of Fe sulfide-rich sediments underneath lava/magma channels and dynamic upgrading of sulfide xenomelts by reaction with the magma (the prevailing model), then magmatic chromite deposits can form by partial melting of Fe oxide-rich sediments underneath lava/magma channels and dynamic upgrading of oxide xenocrysts by reaction with the magma. The anomalously thick (up to 100m) Black Thor-Blackbird, Inyala, Ipueira-Medrado, Kemi, Nkomati, and Sukinda chromite deposits may be examples of this process.",

In this work, we exmine three-dimensional geometric and microphysical properties of Arctic clouds mainly from 8-year space-borne lidar Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR). Cloud Frations (CFs) from CALIOP-CPR and MODIS show similar seasonal and inter-annual variations, but shows significant different in CF over the opened sea area (i.e., Barents and Kara Sea) and over the sea ice. High occurrences of cloud top height are found below 2 km. But comparably high presences of mid- and high-level clouds are also found, especially in winter-time. This suggests that both low- and high-level clouds over the Arctic may influence on the long-wave radiation budget both at the surface and top of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the top height of winter-time clouds looks consistent with tropopause height. Cloud Optical Depth (COD) over the Arctic shows high in summer and low in winter, which would be contrary to the seasonal/monthly variations of CF. High COD during summer can be explained by enhanced level of liquid cloud droplet number concentrations. The number concentration and effective radius (in parenthesis) of liquid cloud droplet during summner was in the range of about 30 to 80 cm-3 (about 6 ~ 16 mm).",

            "abstract": "Aircraft turbine engines emit both primary organic aerosols (POA) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) during the Landing/Take-off (LTO) cycle. Both can react in the atmosphere by aging POA or forming secondary organic aerosols (SOA). These emissions can potentially cause adverse health effects and affect regional air quality. In order to assess the impact of airport emissions, the detailed characterization of the primary and secondary aircraft emissions are required. Particularly, there are open questions on the characterization of VOCs and SOA and their dependence on atmospheric aging at each flight mode.\nVOCs, POA and SOA from 7 turbine engines operated under simulated LTO cycle flight modes are presented. Measurements were conducted at the SR Technics engine test facility at Zurich Airport. Particle composition was investigated by a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), while the VOCs were characterized by a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). Atmospheric aging of engine emissions was simulated by oxidation in a potential aerosol mass (PAM) reactor and characterized as a function of OH exposure in the PAM. The PAM utilizes higher-than-ambient concentrations of OH radicals to perform the equivalent of about 40 hours of ambient oxidation in only 90 seconds.\nVOC emissions and SOA yields are highest at idling and decrease with increasing thrust by a factor of ~ 10. The chemical composition of the exhaust changed with thrust. At low thrust, 30% of the VOC were hydrocarbons (total VOC emission index of 1.6 g/kg fuel) whereas at maximum thrust about 60% of the VOC emitted (total VOC emission index of 0.1 g/kg fuel) were oxygenated compounds e.g. carbonyls and acids. The relationship between aircraft VOC emissions and SOA formation is investigated and used to assess the effect of aircraft emissions on local air quality.",

            "abstract": "Ground-based thermal remote sensing is a valuable tool for the study and monitoring of volcanoes and their hazards. Unlike satellite-based sensors, ground-based thermal cameras can be placed and operated as situations demand, covering restricted areas in high detail, or enabling broad but continuous monitoring of activity. While ground-based sensors have been used extensively at short distances (e.g. <1000 m), there have been few instances where cameras have been used to capture data at the substantially long ranges which facilitate permanent installation and monitoring. This is due primarily to factors such as atmospheric attenuation and across-image variations in the target path-length resulting in substantial uncertainty in the derived surface temperatures.\nHere we present a methodology for correcting and analysing long-range thermal data using MODTRAN transmissivity values calculated for path-lengths >4 km and under different atmospheric conditions (temperature and relative humidity). These corrections have been applied on a per-pixel basis to selected data from the 12 August 2011 paroxysmal event at Mount Etna, Sicily, to calculate lava flow area, flow volume and radiant heat flux. We examined the sensitivity of low, medium, and high apparent temperature pixels to uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions. We then examined how this variability affects the resulting calculations for flow area, volume and radiant heat flux. This was achieved by introducing a fractional error into the measured values for relative humidity. Fractional errors representing 5–25% (with a step value of 2.5%) of the measured relative humidity value were used. Over this range a maximum change of 9.8% was seen in total number of detected hot pixels, 9.1% for values for area and volume, and 8.8% for maximum radiant heat flux. We also examined the effect of changes in the atmospheric temperature has on these calculations. Using a minimum value of 10 C and a maximum value of 26.5 C (maximum recorded value for the date of the eruption) we found a maximum change of 1.3% in total number of detected hot pixels, 1.2% for values of area and volume, and 13.9% for maximum radiant heat flux.",

For the source global digital elevation data, the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 15 arc-second dataset (gap-filling by Jonathan de Ferranti) is used and for land/water mask source, the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 30 arc-second land water mask dataset v5 is used. The original source data is coarsened to a intermediate global 2 minute lat-lon mesh. Then, spectral transformation to the wave space and inverse transformation with wavenumber truncation is performed for isotropic topography smoothness control. Target grid topography mapping is done by bivariate cubic spline interpolation from the truncated 2 minute lat-lon topography. Gibbs phenomenon in the water region can be removed by overwriting ocean masked target coordinate grids with interpolated values from the intermediate 2 minute grid. Finally, a weak smoothing operator is applied on the target grid to minimize the land/water surface height discontinuity that might have been introduced by the Gibbs oscillation removal procedure. Overall, the new topography generation approach provides spectrally-derived, smooth topography with isotropic resolution and minimum damping, enabling realistic topography forcing in the numerical model. Topography is generated for the cubed-sphere grid and tested on the KIAPS Integrated Model (KIM).",

            "abstract": "The motion of the sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean north of Svalbard is characterized by fast sea ice drift (10 to 70 km/day) during the winter season. The Norwegian Young sea ICE cruise (N-ICE2015) took place in that region from January till June 2015. During this period more than 40 buoys in nested arrays at the distance of 5 to 100 km apart from each other were deployed in 2 deployments (in January/February and in April/May). The buoy types include drifters, snow buoys, ice-mass balance buoys, radiation buoys and wave buoys. The buoys were deployed on the first- and second-year ice that was characteristic for the region. The sea ice dynamics measured by these buoy arrays are explored in relation to the changing atmospheric forcing and internal ice stress during the experiment. The deformation rates obtained from the buoy array are on average higher than measured by buoy experiments in other Arctic regions by earlier experiments. Our preliminary results show a strong connection of the deformation events to the atmospheric forcing. The high sea ice drift speed associated to strong winds is connected to high deformation rates, while the low speeds in the calm periods are connected to the low deformation rates. While it is known that the relationship between the deformation rate and the spatial scale over which it is measured can be represented by a power law (Stern and Lindsay, 2009, JGR), we find that the exponent is not constant over time and space during the experiment. For high ice drift speeds, associated with high wind speeds and a more loose ice cover, the exponent becomes more negative than for lower ice drift speeds and a compressed ice cover.\nFigure: Locations of buoy deployments and buoy types for all the buoys deployed during the N-ICE2015 cruise.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet is essential for sea level rise study. A research effort has been made to estimate elevation mass changes at Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf System (LAS), East Antarctica using ICESat data of 2004-2008 and Cryosat-2 data of 2010-2015. A repeat-tack processing method that includes a trend and the first order terrain terms is applied to repeat-track points of all ICESat Campaigns of 2004-2008. The estimated change rate in LAS from 2004-2008 is 3.14±4.13 Gt yr-1. At the basin level, two basins show a combined positive trend of 8.16±2.96 Gt yr-1 while other four basins a combined negative trend of -5.39±6.04 Gt yr-1. Cryosat-2 altimeter works in three modes with the “synthetic aperture interferometer mode” (SARIn) and “low-resolution mode” (LRM) in LAS. Our data coverage is from 2010 to 2015. Cryosat-2 ground tracks do not maintain repeated points. We further divide the entire area into a grid of 5km by 5km. Then we estimate the elevation change rate in each grid cell using a least-squares fitting model with a trend and a second order polynomial. We found that the quality of the estimates is correlated with slopes of cells. The progress of the CryoSat-2 data processing result as well as the analysis with the existing ICESat result will be presented. An integrated model of both ICESat and CryoSat-2 data processing will be developed.",

Measurements of these fluxes were made in 2014 from a 26.3 ha drill-seeded rice (CL XL 753) field. Eddy covariance measurements of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes allow for an integrated field measurement of the interaction between the landscape and the atmosphere. A static vented chamber technique was also used to measure fluxes of CO2, N2O (nitrous oxide) and CH4 in the same field on 19 occasions during the rice growing season. Estimates of GHG flux using static vented chamber were compared with the GHG fluxes from the eddy covariance method. These findings begin to address the increased interest in understanding agricultural impact on net GHG emission and consumption in an understudied region of the US. Future research might include similar data collection from multiple fields where water management is varied to measure its impact on net GHG flux.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane is the second anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, contributing 20% to climate forcing since pre-industrial times. It is emitted by a variety of surface sources and mostly destroyed in the atmosphere by the OH radicals. Although methane emission types are identified, large uncertainties remain in their regional quantification. This is the case in the Arctic, where natural methane emissions are significant and estimated in the range of 11-51 TgCH4.y-1 for lands and 1-12 TgCH4.y-1 for ocean (north of 60°N).\n Subsea permafrost and hydrates in the East Siberian Arctic Ocean Continental Shelf (ESAS) constitute a substantial methane pool, and a potentially large source of methane to the atmosphere. Previous studies based on interpolated oceanographic campaigns estimated atmospheric emissions from this area at 8–17 TgCH4.y-1. Here, we propose insights based on atmospheric observations to evaluate these estimates. Isotopic observations suggest a biogenic origin (either terrestrial or marine) of air masses originating from ESAS during summer. We compare high-resolution simulations of atmospheric methane mole fractions to continuous methane observations to confirm the high variability and heterogeneity of the methane releases from ESAS. Simulated mole fractions including a 8 TgCH4.y-1 source from ESAS are found largely over-estimated compared to the observations in winter, whereas summer signals are more consistent with each others. Based on a statistical analysis of the observations and of the simulations, we find that methane emissions from ESAS are in a range of 0.5–4.5 TgCH4.y-1.",

PAN was measured every 2 minutes by a fast chromatography with luminol-based chemiluminescence detection. Concentration of PAN ranged from 0.15ppbv to 4.37ppbv, with the average of 0.57 ppbv. PAN revealed its peak between 2 and 4 pm matching with the photochemical activities and precursor emission.\nWhen comparing with historic data of PAN in urban Seoul during the past decade, it has decreased about 50%.

Our multi-method study of recent and paleotsunami deposits at the coastal locality Tirúa, Central Chile, demonstrates the necessity of combining different proxies when reconstructing the tsunami record of a locality with a complex tsunami history. Analysis of grain size, petrography and geochemical characteristics, and diatoms, in combination with OSL dating and inverse modelling using TSUFLIND were applied to inferred tsunami and river marsh sediments in the uppermost 2 m of a flood plain in distances of 1.2 to 2 km from the shoreline. The river marsh profiles comprise a complex record of several tsunamigenic sand intercalations showing erosional bases, landward thinning and minor decreases of grain size along the river floodplain.\nSome of the tsunamigenic intercalations consist of unimodal sand with most fractions coarser than 3Φ, whereas the river marsh sediments have polymodal grain size distributions with fractions finer than 3Φ. Some layers interpreted to be tsunamigenic yield mixed grain size distributions similar to the river marsh sediments. Geochemical signatures further discriminate between the different sediments. The tsunami sand intercalations are enriched in Ca, Si, Sr, Ti, Fe and depleted in Al, K, Rb, with low LOI. The enrichment in Fe and Ti, often related to terrigenous input, implies an accumulation of heavy minerals in these layers. The presence of marine diatom assemblages, OSL age inversions in some tsunami layers combined with results of inverse modelling of maximum deposition distance help to identify non-distinct tsunamigenic layers in the river marsh.\nOnly the combination of these different and independent methods allowed for the recognition of six different tsunami events of varying magnitude in the last 1,500 years.",

At that time the spacecraft was commanded to drift along with the comet at distances between 100 km and 50 km, the distance was then successfully lowered to 30 km in September 2014 and to 10 km in November 2014 and bound orbits could be achieved. Based on Doppler tracking data the Rosetta radio science experiment (RSI) was able to determine the mass of the nucleus and its gravity field in spherical harmonics series in order to constrain density and the internal structure of the nucleus.\nThe shape of the comet is complex, a representation of the gravity field as belonging to one single body in either spherical or ellipsoidal harmonics series will give the shape of the body more preference than its internal structure. The observed shape of the nucleus, however, offers the opportunity to interpret it as consisting of two different bodies, namely the “head” and the “feet” sections of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, both having a nearly ellipsoidal shape.\nIn this new approach, the bispherical harmonics expansion, the comet nucleus has been approximated by two independent lobes, each lobe represented by its own spherical harmonics expansion. As a result of the bispherical harmonics representation, it is anticipated that the gravity field will gain higher accuracy and will be less dominated by the complex shape of the comet.\nWe have derived the analytical expressions of the gravity potential and its derivatives of a body in bispherical coordinates and applied this concept to the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The paper will present the bispherical harmonics representation of the gravity field and first results derived from this new concept.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale eddy effects on the subduction of North Pacific mode waters are investigated by comparing observations and ocean general circulation models where eddies are either parameterized or resolved. The eddy resolving models produce results closer to observations than the non-eddy resolving model. There are large discrepancies in subduction patterns between eddy resolving and non-eddy resolving models. In the non-eddy resolving model, subduction on a given isopycnal is limited to the cross point between the mixed layer depth (MLD) front and the outcrop line whereas in eddy resolving models and observations, subduction takes place in a broader, zonally elongated band within the deep mixed layer region. Mesoscale eddies significantly enhance the total subduction rate, helping create remarkable peaks in the volume histogram that correspond to North Pacific subtropical mode water (STMW) and central mode water (CMW). Eddy-enhanced subduction preferentially occurs south of the winter mean outcrop. With an anticyclonic eddy to the west and a cyclonic eddy to the east, the outcrop line meanders south, and the thermocline/MLD shoals eastward. As eddies propagate westward, the MLD shoals, shielding the water of low potential vorticity from the atmosphere. The southward eddy flow then carries the subducted water mass into the thermocline. The eddy subduction processes revealed here have important implications for designing field observations and improving models.",

            "abstract": "Several mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of flat slabs including buoyant features on the subducting plate, trenchward motion of the overriding plate and the thermal or cratonic structure of the overriding plate. Analysis of episodes of flat subduction indicate that not all flat slabs can be attributed to only one of these mechanisms and that it is likely that multiple mechanisms work together to create the necessary conditions for flat slab subduction. In this study we examine the role of localized regions of cratonic lithosphere in the overriding plate in the formation and evolution of flat slabs. We use time-dependent simulations with three-dimensional variation in overriding plate structure. We find that there are two modes of flat subduction: 1) permanent underplating occurs when the slab suction in the mantle wedge is sufficient to fully couple the subducting plate to the overriding lithosphere, and 2) transient flattening occurs when there is sufficient negative-slab buoyancy available along strike to overcome the increased suction on the slab beneath the craton. Our models show how regions of the slab adjacent to the sub-cratonic flat portion continue to pull the slab into the mantle leading to highly contorted slab shapes with apparent slab gaps beneath the craton. These results show how the interpretation of seismic images of subduction zones can be complicated by the occurrence of either permanent or transient flattening of the slab, and how the signature of a recent flat slab episode may persist as the slab resumes normal subduction. Our models suggest that permanent underplating of slabs may preferentially occur below thick and cold lithosphere providing a built-in mechanism for regeneration of cratons.",

For example, the detailed spatiotemporal correlation between slow slip and its associated seismic activity has not been well resolved, and we have limited knowledge of SSE nucleation. Thus, elucidating the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of SSEs may help constrain the physics of SSEs and their associated seismic activity. In this study, we use a modified version of the Network Inversion Filter (NIF) to investigate the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of SSEs including the nucleation and spatiotemporal correlations with seismicity.\nWe focus on a SSE that occurred near the Boso Peninsula, in central Japan, from December 2013 to January 2014. We apply the modified NIF to GPS time series to estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of daily cumulative slip and slip rate on the subducting Philippine Sea plate. We find that the evolution of the SSE and its associated seismicity is divided into two distinct phases. Slip initially accelerated slowly with low slip rates, low propagation speeds, and no accompanying seismicity during the early phase, and then accelerated more rapidly with higher slip rates, a higher propagation speed, and local earthquake swarm activity during the later phase. The seismicity was highly correlated in space and time with slip rate, suggesting that the swarm activity was triggered by stress loading due to the slow slip. The transition from the slow to faster phase shares some similarities with the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes inferred from foreshock activities, suggesting that SSEs may provide insights into the nucleation of large earthquakes.",

We obtain this map by means of the vector Spherical Harmonics, following the approach of Gubbins et al., 2011. This formalism has the advantage to alleviate the non-uniquess issue that characterizes the inversion of the observable magnetic field for the underlying magnetization. It does so by separating the part of the magnetization that produces the observable magnetic field from the part of the magnetization that does not. Based on this map, and a series of synthetic tests, we investigate the accuracy to which paleopoles positions can be retrieved from magnetic field measurements. We discuss our results in combination with previous studies on Mars paleopoles positions.",

            "abstract": "Motions of Earth’s plates are thought to be driven by slab pull, basal drag, and ridge push. Here we propose that plate motions during supercontinental fragmentation are decisively controlled by the non-linear decay of a resistive force: rift strength.\nWe use state-of-the-art global tectonic reconstructions and the new geotectonic analysis tool pyGPlates to analyze the transition from rifting to sea-floor spreading of well-studied post-Pangea rift systems (Central Atlantic, South Atlantic, Iberia/Newfoundland, Australia/Antarctica, North Atlantic, South China Sea, Gulf of California). In all cases, continental extension starts with a slow phase (< 10 mm/yr, full extension velocity) followed by a rapid acceleration over periods of a few My that introduces a fast rift phase (> 10 mm/yr). The transition from slow to fast extension takes place long before crustal break-up. In fact, we find that approximately half of the present day rifted margin area was created during the slow, and the other half during the fast phase. We reproduce the transition from slow to fast rifting using numerical forward models with force boundary conditions, such that rift velocities are not imposed but instead evolve naturally in response to changing strength of the rift. These models show that the two-phase velocity behavior during rifting and the rapid speed-up are intrinsic features of continental rupture that can be robustly inferred for different crust and mantle rheologies.\nIt has been proposed that abrupt plate accelerations can be caused by plume-lithosphere interaction, subduction initiation, and slab detachment. However, none of these mechanisms explains our result that plate speed-up systematically precedes continental break-up. We therefore propose dynamic rift weakening as a new mechanism for rapid plate motion changes.",

            "abstract": "The Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems Technology Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) is designed to demonstrate required technology to enable a constellation of 6U-Class nanosatellites to directly observe the time evolution of clouds and study the conditions that control the transition of clouds to precipitation using high-temporal resolution observations. TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers in the 90-GHz to 183-GHz frequency range penetrate into the cloud to observe key changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. The evolution of ice formation in clouds is important for climate prediction since it largely drives Earth’s radiation budget. TEMPEST improves understanding of cloud processes and helps to constrain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models.\n TEMPEST-D provides observations at five millimeter-wave frequencies from 90 to 183 GHz using a single compact instrument that is well suited for the 6U-Class architecture and fits well within the capabilities of NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI), for which TEMPEST-D was approved in 2015. For a potential future mission of one year of operations, five identical 6U-Class satellites deployed in the same orbital plane with 5-10 minute spacing at ~400 km altitude and 50°-65° inclination are expected to capture 3 million observations of precipitation, including 100,000 deep convective events. TEMPEST is designed to provide critical information on the time evolution of cloud and precipitation microphysics, yielding a first-order understanding of the behavior of assumptions in current cloud-model parameterizations in diverse climate regimes.",

It is superimposed to topography and ground deformation signals hindering the measurement of geophysical processes like earthquakes. Exploiting the ionosphere dispersive nature of the ionosphere, the method separates the ionospheric component of the interferometric phase from the non-dispersive component, related to topography, ground motion and tropospheric path delay. An implementation of the split-spectrum method is in this work exposed in detail and its performance is analyzed. We test the method using various ALOS PALSAR interferometric pairs with different characteristics: high to low coherence, moving and non-moving terrain, with and without topography and different ionosphere states. Ionospheric errors of almost one meter have been corrected to a centimeter or millimeter level. The results show how the method is able to systematically compensate the ionospheric phase in interferograms. In this work we also present ALOS PALSAR ionospheric-free interferograms and the related ionospheric phase screens for the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the 2008 Kyrgyzstan earthquake, and the 2011 Myanmar earthquke.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 Mw7.7 Balochistan, Pakistan, earthquake occurred on the curved Hoshab fault. This fault connects with the north-south trending Chaman strike-slip fault to northeast, and with the west-east trending Makran thrust fault system to southwest. Teleseismic waveform inversion, incorporated with coseismic ground surface deformation data, show that the rupture of this earthquake nucleated around northeast segment of the fault, and then propagated southwestward along the northwest dipping Hoshab fault about 200 km, with the maximum coseismic displacement, featured mainly by purely left-lateral strike-slip motion, about 10 meters. In context of the India-Asia collision frame, associating with the fault geometry around this region, the rupture propagation of this earthquake seems to not follow an optimal path along the fault segment, because after nucleation of this event the Hoshab fault on the southwest of hypocenter of this earthquake is clamped by elastic stress change. Here, we build a three-dimensional finite-element model to explore the evolution of both stress and pore-pressure during the rupturing process of this earthquake. In the model, the crustal deformation is treated as undrained poroelastic media as described by Biot’s theory, and the instantaneous rupture process is specified with split-node technique. By testing a reasonable range of parameters, including the coefficient of friction, the undrained Poisson’s ratio, the permeability of the fault zone and the bulk crust, numerical results have shown that after the nucleation of rupture of this earthquake around the northeast of the Hoshab fault, the positive change of normal stress (clamping the fault) on the fault plane is greatly reduced by the instantaneous increase of pore pressure (unclamping the fault). This process could result in the change of Coulomb failure stress resolved on the Hoshab fault to be hastened, explaining the possible mechanism for southwestward propagation of rupture of the Mw7.7 Balochistan earthquake along the Hoshab fault.",

            "abstract": "Little is known about the controls on the initiation and development of magmatism and segmentation in young rift systems. The northern Lake Malawi (Nyasa) rift in the East African Rift System is an early stage rift exhibiting pronounced tectonic segmentation, which is defined in the upper crust by ~100-km-long border faults. Very little volcanism is associated with rifting; the only surface expression of magmatism occurs in an accommodation zone between segments to the north of the lake in the Rungwe Volcanic Province. The SEGMeNT (Study of Extension and maGmatism in Malawi aNd Tanzania) project is a multidisciplinary, multinational study that is acquiring a suite of geophysical, geological and geochemical data to characterize deformation and magmatism in the crust and mantle lithosphere along 2-3 segments of this rift.\nAs a part of the SEGMeNT project, we acquired seismic reflection and refraction data in Lake Malawi (Nyasa) in March-April 2015. Over 2000 km of seismic reflection data were acquired with a 500 to 2580 cu in air gun array from GEUS/Aarhus and a 500- to 1500-m-long seismic streamer from Syracuse University over a grid of lines across and along the northern and central basins. Air gun shots from MCS profiles and 1000 km of additional shooting with large shot intervals were also recorded on 27 short-period and 6 broadband lake bottom seismometers from Scripps Oceanographic Institute as a part of the Ocean Bottom Seismic Instrument Pool (OBSIP) as well as the 55-station onshore seismic array. The OBS were deployed along one long strike line and two dip lines.\nWe will present preliminary data and results from seismic reflection and refraction data acquired in the lake and their implications for crustal deformation within and between rift segments. Seismic reflection data image structures up to ~5-6 km below the lake bottom, including syntectonic sediments, intrabasinal faults and other complex horsts. Some intrabasinal faults in both the northern and central basins offset the youngest sediments, indicating that they are active. These include faults in the area of the 2009 Karonga earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Moisture originating from the subtropical North Atlantic feeds precipitation throughout the Western Hemisphere. This ocean-land moisture exchange leaves its imprint on sea surface salinity (SSS), enabling SSS over the subtropical oceans to be an indicator of terrestrial precipitation. This study demonstrates that springtime SSS over the northwestern portion of the subtropical North Atlantic significantly correlates with summertime precipitation over the United States (US) Midwest. The linkage between springtime SSS and the Midwest summer precipitation is established through ocean-to-land moisture transport followed by a soil moisture feedback over the southern US. In the spring, high SSS over the Northwestern subtropical Atlantic coincides with a local increase in moisture flux divergence. The moisture flux is then directed toward and converges over the southern US, which experiences increased precipitation and soil moisture. The increased soil moisture influences the regional water cycle both thermodynamically and dynamically, leading to excessive summer precipitation in the Midwest. Thermodynamically, the increased soil\nmoisture tends to moisten the lower troposphere and enhances the meridional humidity gradient north of 36N. Thus, more moisture converges into the Midwest transported by the climatological low-level wind. Dynamically, the increases in soil moisture over the Southern US enhance the west-to-east soil moisture gradient eastward of the Rocky Mountains, which intensifies the Great Plains Low-level jet in the summer favoring moisture flux convergence over the Midwest. Due to these robust physical linkages, the springtime SSS outweighs the leading SST modes in predicting the Midwest summer precipitation and significantly improves rainfall prediction in this region.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet (GRIS) contains approximately 7.36m of sea level equivalent that could melt over the next 1000 years. Therefore understanding the response of the GRIS during past warm periods is fundamentally important. The Late Pliocene (LP) has similarities to the projected 21st Century climate, and there is enough available data to constrain ice sheet and iceberg modelling studies, thus it make the LP a useful palaeoclimate modelling target.\nWithin the LP, the mid Piacenzian Warm Period (mPWP) is particularly well documented. The USGS PRISM (Pliocene Research, Interpretation & Synoptic Mapping) project focuses on the mPWP (3.26 –3.025Ma) and was chosen for the similarities to modern in paleogeography, CO2 levels and because fossil assemblages of LP foraminifera are largely composed of extant species. Data sets of PRISM are used as boundary conditions in climate models which simulate ice sheet and iceberg scenarios in warm conditions of the mid/high latitudes. In the mPWP, temperatures were 2–3°C warmer than present and CO2 level was about 405ppmv. Multi-climate and multi-ice sheet modelling studies show retreat in the GRIS to higher elevation.\nHowever, immediately prior to the mPWP, Marine Isotope Stage M2 (3.3Ma) is a cold period in the warmer LP background. Localized evidence of ice during the M2 exists but if a larger northern hemisphere (NH) glaciation occurred, evidence has been erased. Evidence shows a drop in sea level up to 60m and CO2 at 220ppmv. Climate models show a medium/large NH ice cover is plausible at the M2. The exact extent during both warm and cold periods in the LP remains unclear.\nEvidence of this extent can be seen in marine sediment cores as ice rafted debris (IRD) which helps decipher the state of the ice sheet. The distribution of mPWP North Atlantic IRD in space and time tells us about the location of iceberg-producing glaciers of the NH. Using the M2 and mPWP climate scenarios, we have modelled iceberg trajectories to see where IRD would be found in the North Atlantic under warm and cold LP conditions. These are compared with the location of IRD evidence in the North Atlantic and presented here.",

            "abstract": "The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) have exhibited significant changes over recent decades but there is still great uncertainty about how rapidly and how far they will retreat in a warmer climate. For example, it remains unclear whether or not the marine-based WAIS “collapsed” during the last interglacial period, resulting in a global sea-level rise contribution of more than 3 m. Previous studies, including Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 178, have shown that sediment drifts on the continental rise west of the Antarctic Peninsula contain a rich high-resolution archive of Antarctic margin paleoceanography and APIS history that extends back to at least the Late Miocene. The potential of existing ODP cores from the drifts is, however, compromised by the fact that composite sections are incomplete and lack of precise chronological control. A new drilling proposal (732-Full2) has been scientifically approved and is with the JOIDES Resolution Facilities Board of the International Ocean Discovery Program for scheduling. The main aims of the proposal are to obtain continuous, high-resolution records from sites on sediment drifts off both the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica (southern Bellingshausen Sea) and to achieve good chronological control on them using a range of techniques. We present preliminary results from a recent site survey investigation cruise on RRS James Clark Ross (JR298) that obtained high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection data over the proposed sites and adjacent working areas. The new data provide a basis for interpretation of (i) sedimentary processes that operated during the development of the drifts, and (ii) links between depositional systems on the continental rise, paleo-ice-sheet dynamics and paleoceanographic processes. Through further analyses of seismic and other geophysical data, in combination with marine sediment cores retrieved from the proposed sites, we aim to provide insight into polar margin sediment delivery, Antarctic ice-sheet history and stability, and Antarctic margin paleoceanography. Subsequently, the proposed drilling campaign will allow a detailed chronology to be established on extended records that will provide a basis for high-resolution interpretations extending back through the Pliocene.",

            "abstract": "Around pre-existing geological faults in the crust, we have often observed off-fault damage zone where there are many fractures with various scales, from ~ mm to ~ m and their density typically increases with proximity to the fault. One of the fracture formation processes is considered to be dynamic shear rupture propagation on the faults, which leads to the occurrence of earthquakes. Here, I have conducted experiments on propagation of fault slip along a pre-cut rock surface to investigate the damaging behavior of rocks with slip propagation.\nFor the experiments, I used a pair of metagabbro blocks from Tamil Nadu, India, of which the contacting surface simulates a fault of 35 cm in length and 1cm width. The experiments were done with the similar uniaxial loading configuration to Rosakis et al. (2007). Axial load σ is applied to the fault plane with an angle 60° to the loading direction. When σ is 5kN, normal and shear stresses on the fault are 1.25MPa and 0.72MPa, respectively. Timing and direction of slip propagation on the fault during the experiments were monitored with several strain gauges arrayed at an interval along the fault. The gauge data were digitally recorded with a 1MHz sampling rate and 16bit resolution.\nWhen σ is 4.8kN is applied, we observed some fault slip events where a slip nucleates spontaneously in a subsection of the fault and propagates to the whole fault. However, the propagation speed is about 1.2km/s, much lower than the S-wave velocity of the rock. This indicates that the slip events were not earthquake-like dynamic rupture ones. More efforts are needed to reproduce earthquake-like slip events in the experiments. This work is supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (26870912).",

            "abstract": "Arrival times from over 3,100 earthquakes and 2,800 mine blasts recorded at USArray Transportable Array (TA) and other regional broadband seismic stations are inverted to find the regional P and S velocity structure in Colorado and New Mexico. Knowledge of the crustal structure in Colorado will help inform to what extent this structure and composition influences the isostatic compensation of high topography in the region. The relationship between the Rio Grande rift and the surrounding physiographic provinces remains enigmatic, and neither the geology nor geophysical surveys have clearly resolved the rift in Colorado. Therefore, tomography may supply more information about velocity variations along the rift within the context of the Colorado Plateau, the Great Plains, and the Rocky Mountains. Thus far, applications with the TA data to resolve P wave crustal structure are rare due to distant station spacing and small magnitude and shallow (mid to upper crustal) local earthquakes. The depths of the earthquakes range from 4 km to the mid-crust, so we expect dense ray coverage in the upper crust. In order to increase the number of crossing rays, we use mine blast P wave arrivals to constrain shallow surface structure. A total of 70,000 P wave arrivals and 18,000 S wave arrivals constitute the dataset. We develop a reliable 1D regional velocity model using 500 of the largest earthquakes with a fixed Vp/Vs ratio from the arrival data, then use this model as an input to investigate the feasibility of utilization of a 3D inversion algorithm. While use of a 3D inversion algorithm will be explored, construction of a series of 1D velocity and Vp/Vs models may prove to be more robust.",

            "abstract": "At the regional and global scales, coastal management and planning for future sea level rise scenarios is typically supported by modelling tools that predict the expected inundation extent. These tools rely on a number of simplifying assumptions that, in some cases, may result in important overestimation or underestimation of the inundation extent. One of such cases is coastal wetlands, where vegetation strongly affects both the magnitude and the timing of inundation. Many coastal wetlands display other forms of flow restrictions due to, for example, infrastructure or drainage works, which also alters the inundation patterns.\nIn this contribution we explore the effects of flow restrictions on inundation patterns under sea level rise conditions in coastal wetlands. We use a dynamic wetland evolution model that not only incorporates the effects of flow restrictions due to culverts, bridges and weirs as well as vegetation, but also considers that vegetation changes as a consequence of increasing inundation. We apply our model to a coastal wetland in Australia and compare predictions of our model to predictions using conventional approaches. We found that some restrictions accentuate detrimental effects of sea level rise while others moderate them. We also found that some management strategies based on flow redistribution that provide short term solution may result more damaging in the long term if sea level rise is considered.",

            "abstract": "We perform self-consistent hybrid simulations on electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) triggered emissions with a gradient of the non-uniform ambient magnetic field and obtained broadband and clear rising tone EMIC emissions. We also performed the test particle simulations for scattering of the relativistic electrons. Broadband emissions induce rapid precipitation of energetic protons and relativistic electrons into the loss cone since the scattering by the concurrent triggering takes place faster than that of the coherent emissions. The coherent triggered emission causes efficient proton acceleration around the equator because of the stable particle trapping by the coherent rising tone emission. Nonlinear trapping causes significant relativistic electron scattering in wide energy range. Since the frequency of the rising tone emissions reaches close to the gyro-frequency and the emission also induces lower band EMIC waves which are also close to the gyro-frequency, the minimum resonance energy of the electrons reaches 300 keV. The higher energetic electrons (with 6 MeV to 20 MeV) are scattered almost 70 % for both broadband and rising tone cases. The hybrid simulations including cold ion heating are also performed, which shows the selective heating of heavy ions (Helium and Oxygen). These heating mechanism also makes the dynamic spectrum of the EMIC wave complex.",

            "abstract": "The cryosphere of mountain regions is fastly changing in response to climate change. This is particularly evident in global-scale glacier retreat. Trends in snow cover, however, are more difficult to determine, as annual fluctuations can be very large. Snow is an important parameter in the energy and mass balance of glaciers and the snow line altitude (SLA) at the end of the melting period can be considered as a proxy for the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). By frequently observing the SLA from satellite, region-wide monitoring of glaciers and improved calibration and validation of transient glacier (mass balance) models is possible. In the near future, frequent mapping of the SLA will be strongly facilitated by satellite missions like Sentinel 2A/B, where the same region will be covered every 5 days with 10 m spatial resolution.\nFor this study we have developed an automated tool to derive the SLA for large glacier samples from remote sensing data. The method is first applied in the Ötztal Alps (Austria) where reliable in-situ data of mass balance and ELA are available for several glaciers over a 30-years period. The algorithm currently works with multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1972-2015), digital glacier outlines and a high-quality national DEM. All input datasets are atmospherically and topographically pre-processed before the SLA is automatically retrieved for each glacier. The remote-sensing derived SLA is generally about 200 m lower than the ELA, however, a clear trend in the altitude of the end of summer snow line is detectable (~ 200 m), which is in agreement with the ELA trend observed in the field. After bias correction and conversion to mass balance, the variability in observed mass balance can be well reproduced from the satellite-derived SLA time series. This is promising for application of the approach in other regions.",

            "abstract": "The geochemistry and mineralogy of the mantle source for primary kimberlite melts is still very much debated, the primary melt is argued to be either of carbonatitic or kimberlitic nature and proposed melting mechanisms range from low-degree partial melting of a carbonated peridotite to high-degree melting of strongly metasomatized veins. Experimental multiple saturation of a proposed close-to-primary kimberlitic composition from Jericho (Kopylova et al. 2007, GCA) at 7 GPa shows that saturation of a lherzolitic mineral assemblage occurs at 1300-1350 °C resulting in a carbonatitic melt with less than 8 wt% SiO2 and >35 wt% CO2. At higher temperatures, where the Jericho melt stays kimberlitic, it is only saturated in opx and garnet.\nWe hence forced the close-to-primary Jericho kimberlite into multiple saturation with a lherzolitic assemblage (7 GPa, 1400-1650 °C) by adding a volatile-free peridotite with the aim to saturate the system in olivine, opx, cpx and garnet. This mineral assemblage is obtained over a wide temperature range (1400-1600 °C) for a starting Jericho composition with 20-22.5 wt% CO2, H2O was kept at 0.46 wt% corresponding to the K:H ratio of phlogopite. The transition from a carbonatitic melt with ~10 wt% SiO2 and >35 wt% CO2 to a kimberlitic melt with ~27 wt% SiO2 and <25 wt% CO2 occurs from 1450 to 1600 °C. Compared to the Jericho composition, these melts have higher Na2O and lower XMg. At lower CO2 contents (10 wt%) opx was absent, while at higher CO2 (30 wt%) olivine and cpx were not stable.\nKimberlitic melts in equilibrium with a lherzolite are obtained for temperatures of >1500 °C, requiring a few hundred degrees more than estimated for the base of the cratonic lithosphere (1200-1400 °C at a heat flux of 40-45 mW/m2). If lower temperature carbonatites intrude into the base of the lithosphere it is questionable how these should develop into kimberlites within the lithosphere.",

Short term prediction or nowcasting relates to forecasting convective precipitation for time periods less than a few hours to avoid its effect on agriculture, aviation and lifestyle. Theoretical models involving radiometric predictions are not well understood and lack in temporal and spatial resolution. In this study specific utilization of a microwave Radiometer (Radiometrics Corporation, USA) for online monitoring of precipitable rainfall activity has been observed repeatability of data has been established. Previous few studies have shown the increase of water vapour and corresponding Brightness Temperature, but in mountain climatic conditions over Darjeeling, due to presence of fog 90 % of the year, water vapour monitoring related predictions can lead to false alarms. The measurement of blackbody emission noise in the bands of 23.8 GHz and 31.4 GHz, using a quadratic regression retrieval algorithm is converted to atmospheric parameters like integrated water vapour and liquid water content. It has been found in our study that the liquid water shows significant activity prior to precipitation events even for mild and stratiform rainfall. The alarm can be generated well 20 mins before the commencement of actual rain events even in the upper atmosphere of 6 Kms, measured by a rain radar also operating in 24 Ghz microwave band. Although few rain events were found and reported which do not respond in the microwave liquid water channel. Efforts to identify such rain events and their possible explanation is going on and shall be reported in near future. Such studies are important to predict flash flooding in the Himalayas. Darjeeling owing to its geographical conditions experiences mild to very heavy rain. Such studies help improve aspects of Himalayas as well.",

            "abstract": "EUSTACE (EU Surface Temperatures for All Corners of Earth) is a Horizon2020 project that will produce a spatially complete, near-surface air temperature (NSAT) analysis for the globe for every day since 1850. The analysis will be based on both satellite and in situ surface temperature observations over land, sea, ice and lakes, which will be combined using state-of-the-art statistical methods. The use of satellite data will enable the EUSTACE analysis to offer improved estimates of NSAT in regions that are poorly observed in situ, compared with existing in-situ based analyses. This presentation illustrates how satellite land surface temperature (LST) data – sourced from the European Space Agency (ESA) Data User Element (DUE) GlobTemperature project - will be used in EUSTACE. Satellite LSTs represent the temperature of the Earth’s skin, which can differ from the corresponding NSAT by several degrees or more, particularly during the hottest part of the day. Therefore the first challenge is to develop an approach to estimate global NSAT from satellite observations. Two methods will be trialled in EUSTACE, both of which are summarised here: an established empirical regression-based approach for predicting NSAT from satellite data, and a new method whereby NSAT is calculated from LST and other parameters using a physics-based model. The second challenge is in estimating the uncertainties for the satellite NSAT estimates, which will determine how these data are used in the final blended satellite-in situ analysis. This is also important as a key component of EUSTACE is in delivering accurate uncertainty information to users. An overview of the methods to estimate the satellite NSATs is also included in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems serve as windows to a dynamic, gradient-dominated deep biosphere that is home to a wide diversity of archaea, bacteria, and viruses. Until recently the majority of these microbial lineages were uncultivated, resulting in a poor understanding of how the physical and geochemical context shapes microbial evolution in the deep subsurface. By comparing metagenomes, metatranscriptomes and single-cell genomes between geologically distinct vent fields, we can better understand the relationship between the environment and the evolution of subsurface microbial communities. An ideal setting in which to use this approach is the Mid-Cayman Rise, located on the world’s deepest and slowest-spreading mid-ocean ridge, which hosts both the mafic-influenced Piccard and ultramafic-influenced Von Damm vent fields. Previous work has shown that Von Damm has higher taxonomic and metabolic diversity than Piccard, consistent with geochemical model expectations, and the fluids from all vents are enriched in hydrogen (Reveillaud et al., submitted). Mapping of both metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to a combined assembly showed very little overlap among the Von Damm samples, indicating substantial variability that is consistent with the diversity of potential metabolites in this ultramafic vent field. In contrast, the most consistently abundant and active lineage across the Piccard samples was Sulfurovum, a sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotroph that uses nitrate or oxygen as an electron acceptor. Moreover, analysis of point mutations within individual lineages suggested that Sulfurovumat Piccard is under strong selection, whereas microbial genomes at Von Damm were more variable. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the subsurface environment at Piccard supports the emergence of a dominant lineage that is under strong selection pressure, whereas the more geochemically diverse microbial habitat at Von Damm creates a wider variety of stable ecological niches, facilitating higher diversity both within and between microbial lineages. By examining how the environment is imprinted into microbial genomes, we hope to gain insight into how subsurface microbial communities co-evolve with their environment in both the present and the deep past.",

            "abstract": "The West African Monsoon (WAM) is crucial for the socio-economic stability of millions of people living in the Sahel. Severe droughts have ravaged the region in the last three decades of the 20th century, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the WAM dynamics. One of the most dramatic changes in the WAM occurred between 15,000-5,000 years BP, when increased summer precipitation led to the so-called “Green Sahara” and to a reduction in dust emissions from the region. Previous studies have shown that variations in vegetation and soil type can have major impacts on precipitation. However, model simulations are still unable to fully reproduce the intensification and geographical expansion of the African monsoon during that period, even when vegetation over the Sahara is simulated. Here, we use a fully coupled simulation for 6000 years BP in which prescribed Saharan vegetation and dust concentrations are changed in turn. A close agreement with proxy records is obtained only when both Saharan vegetation and dust decrease are taken into account (Fig. 1). The dust reduction extends the monsoon’s northern limit further than the vegetation-change case only (Fig. 2), by strengthening vegetation-albedo feedbacks and driving a deeper Saharan Heat Low. The dust reduction under vegetated Sahara conditions leads to a northward shift of the WAM extension that is about twice as large as the shift due to the changes in orbital forcing alone. We therefore conclude that accounting for changes in Saharan dust loadings is essential for improving model simulations of the MH WAM. The role of dust is also relevant when looking into the future, since Saharan dust emission may decrease owing to both direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts on land cover.",

            "abstract": "Beyond 2015, eradicating hunger will remain a critical part of the global development agenda through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Efforts to limit climate change through both mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and land use policies may interact with food availability and accessibility in complex and unanticipated ways. Here, we develop projections of regional food accessibility to 2050 under the alternative futures outlined by the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and under different climate policy targets and structures. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), an integrated assessment model (IAM), for our projections. We calculate food access as the weighted average of consumption of five staples and the portion of income spend on those commodities and extend the GCAM calculated universal global producer price to regional consumer prices drawing on historical relationships of these prices. Along the SSPs, food access depends largely on expectations of increases in population and economic status. Under a more optimistic scenario, the pressures on food access from increasing demand and rising prices can be counterbalanced by faster economic development. Stringent climate policies that increase commodity prices, however, may hinder vulnerable regions, namely Sub-Saharan Africa, from achieving greater food accessibility.",

            "abstract": "Seismic and electromagnetic measurements are promising tools for the detection and quantification of gas hydrate occurrences in nature. The seismic wave velocity depends among others on the hydrate quantity and the quality (e.g. pore filling or cementing hydrate). For a proper interpretation of seismic data the knowledge of the dependency of physical properties as a function of hydrate saturation in a certain scenario is crucial.\nWithin the SUGAR III project we determine such dependencies for various scenarios to support models for joint inversion of seismic and EM data e.g. for the shallow gas hydrate reservoirs in the Danube Delta. Since the formation of artificial lab samples containing pore filling hydrate from methane dissolved in water is a complex and time consuming procedure, we developed an easier alternative. Ice is very similar to hydrate in some of its physical properties. Therefore it might be used as analogous pore fill in a “quick look” experiment to determine the dependency of rock physical properties on hydrate content. We used the freezing point depression of a KCl solution to generate a dependency of ice saturation on temperature. The measured seismic wave velocity in dependence on ice saturation compares very well with data measured on a glass bead sediment sample with methane hydrate formed from methane dissolved in water. We could also observe that ice, formed from a salt solution in the pore space of sediment, behaves similar to methane hydrate as a non-cementing solid pore fill.",

            "abstract": "The study of extreme events has gained the attention of hydrologists in recent times. Though these events are rare, the effects are catastrophic. It is reported that the frequency of the occurrence of these events has increased in recent decades, and is attributed to the recent revelation of climate change. Numerous studies have pointed out significant changes in extremely heavy precipitation over India, using coarse resolution data. Though there are disagreements in the results and its spatial uniformity, all these studies emphasize the need of fine resolution analysis. Fine resolution analysis is necessary mainly due to the highly heterogeneous characteristics of Indian monsoon, and for the proper employment in flood hazard preparedness and water resources management. The present study aims to analyse the spatio‑temporal variation and trends in the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation during Indian monsoon using 0.25°×0.25° resolution gridded data for a period of 113 years (1901-2013). The exceedance threshold is fixed at 90th percentile of rainfall over 113 years and parameters are defined accordingly. The maximum intensity of each extreme rainfall episode of 30 year moving window has been modelled using Peak Over Threshold based Extreme Value Theory to compute return level (considered for intensity). In addition, the number of such episodes in a particular year has been termed as frequency. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been carried out for both intensity and frequency, to compute the statistical trend. In addition, moving block bootstrap approach has been used to incorporate the serial correlation. The significance of the trend has been evaluated at different significance levels and finally, change in trend over last century has been examined.",

Using CMIP5 single forcing experiments from an ensemble of models that provided anthropogenic aerosol only simulations to the archive, we quantify the influence of anthropogenic aerosol on several aspects of the atmospheric circulation, including tropical width, jet position, and jet strength. We show that there is a robust circulation response to anthropogenic aerosol in the mid twentieth century, induced by the large increases in emissions at that time. Although most anthropogenic aerosol is found in the Northern Hemisphere, a response is found in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We investigate the extent to which diversity in the temperature and circulation responses to aerosol are related to diversity in aerosol loading and radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "We present a 750-year long tree-ring chronology from black pines (Pinus nigra) in Valia Kalda National Park, Pindos Mountains, Greece. The chronology shows a strong climate signal which consists of significant negative correlation (R=-0.5) with summer temperature (Jun-Jul-Aug-Sep), and positive correlation with summer precipitation. We exploit these relationships to reconstruct summer climate from ~1250 CE to present. In particular we investigate the character of the Little Ice Age (LIA) on mountainous Greece. We find evidence for cooler/wetter summers during the 18th and 19th centuries, but warmer/drier summers during the 14th through 17th centuries, during some of the coldest periods of the LIA in Northern Europe including the Maunder Minimum. This counter-intuitive pattern suggests the LIA had distinct signatures in the Easter Mediterranean, diverging from those of Northern Europe. The temperature pattern reconstructed here is remarkably similar to a recent reconstruction of summer temperatures from maximum latewood density (MXD) of Pinus heldreichii on Mount Olympus, just 150 km east of our site. However, because of the ambivalence of the climate signal with respect to temperature vs. precipitation in both of these reconstructions, there remains uncertainty as to whether the LIA was primarily warm, or dry, or some combination. We advocate for further reconstructions of LIA climate in the Balkan Peninsula and Eastern Mediterranean to explore relationships with Northern Europe and elucidate the broader climatic pattern and dynamical connections.",

            "abstract": "Agriculturally-derived excess nitrogen in Midwestern US streams and rivers has contributed to water quality impairments at the local, regional, and continental scales, such as the dead zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Rates of biogeochemical processing of nitrogen, through denitrification and assimilation, vary throughout space and time and are dependent on factors such as carbon and nitrogen availability, temperature and water residence time. Through an extensive field sampling campaign in the Minnesota River Basin, a 44,000 km2 agricultural basin in the upper Midwest, we investigated the spatial and temporal variability of nitrate concentrations throughout the river network and found that wetlands and lakes, characterized by long residence time and vegetative flow paths, behave as hot spots of nitrogen reduction. We documented that during the critical high loading period of late spring, nitrate concentrations were dependent on the fraction of lakes and wetlands composing the drainage area and that this dependency held even after controlling for the fraction of drainage area in crops. Variability in N uptake within wetlands was characterized through a separate field sampling effort in order to determine first order controls on denitrification and assimilation rates. These observational results were used to develop a spatially explicit, reduced complexity fluvial network model of nitrate transport and uptake which, together with the field measurements, highlights the disproportionately large contribution of wetlands and lakes to nitrate reduction and thus affirms the need to strategically conserve wetlands in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Ultimately, this effort can guide wetland restoration and management by quantifying critical locations and wetland specifications for achieving desired nitrate reductions within a basin.",

            "abstract": "Accelerating glacier recession in the tropical Andes is transforming downstream hydrology, while increasing demands for water by end-users (even beyond the watershed limits) is complicating the assessment of vulnerability. Future scenarios of hydro-climatic vulnerability require a better understanding of coupled hydrologic and human systems, involving both multiscale process studies and more robust models of glacier-climate interactions. We synthesize research in two proglacial valleys of glacierized mountain ranges in different regions of Peru that are both in proximity to growing water usage from urban sectors, agriculture, hydroelectric generation, and mining. In both the Santa River watershed draining the Cordillera Blanca and the Shullcas River watershed below Hyuatapallana Mountain in Junin, glaciers have receded over 25% since the 1980s. Historical runoff and glacier data, combined with glacier-climate modeling, show a long-term decrease in discharge resulting from a net loss of stored water. We find evidence that this altered hydrology is transforming proglacial wetland ecology and water quality, even while water resource use has intensified. Beyond glaciers, our results show that over 60% of the dry season base flow in each watershed is groundwater sourced from heterogeneous aquifers. Municipal water supply in Huancayo already relies on 18 groundwater wells. Perceptions of water availability and actual water use practices remain relatively divorced from the actual water resources provided from each mountain range. Critical changes in glacier volume and water supply are not perceived or acknowledged consistently amongst different water users, nor reflected in water management decisions. In order to identify, understand, model, and adapt to climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of water availability and groundwater processes (the domain of hydrologists) with that of water use (the focus for social scientists). Attention must be drawn to evaluating risks and adaptation options with rigorous, data-based scenario evaluations of how management decisions impact all end users.",

An average of 20 TC per year enter the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR), around 9 of which make landfall. Tropical cyclone enhances monsoons which cause heavy rainfall, bring in strong winds that are capable of destroying properties. This strong wind also causes storm surges that inundate the coastal portions of the country.\nTyphoon Haiyan is one of the most recent and devastating events, which left the Philippines with 6,293 deaths and 2 billion USD worth of damages. In this regard, the Department of Science and Technology – Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (DOST – Project NOAH) started a project to quantify, identify and map the storm surge hazards in the country. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) storm surge model is used to simulate 721 TCs that enter PAR. The JMA storm surge model yields time series plots for each observation point that has been defined by the team. Maximum tide levels are identified using the WXtide software, and are added to the resulting storm surge time series for each observation point. The storm tide levels are then categorized into 4 groups which is based on its peak height, this is done to create a storm surge advisory (SSA) based on the probable storm tide height. The 4 groups are SSA 1 (0.01m to 2m), SSA 2 (2.01m to 3m), SSA 3 (3.01m to 4m), and SSA 4 (4m and above).\nA time series plot for each advisory is used as an input data in Flo2D flood modelling software. This software is a grid developer system software that has maps with topographies and creates models based on the grid topographies, boundaries, and tides. This modelling software can produce the probable extent,depth of inundation and its corresponding hazard level of storm surge.\nThe storm surge advisory improves the capabilities of the country in mitigating disasters. Through this advisory, the people will be able to visualize the extent of danger that a tropical cyclone might entail.",

            "abstract": "This project explores new intercomparisons between reanalysis data and CMIP5 models and introduces a new way to quantify stratosphere-troposphere (S-T) coupling, through the movement of mass in and out of the polar cap at different levels, as measured by mean polar cap pressure at fixed heights. The aims of this project are to investigate how mass movement is related to variations in stratospheric circulations, such as the wintertime polar vortex; assess how it is represented in climate models; establish whether different model parameterisations produce different S-T coupling outcomes; and identify any projected changes as a result of climate change. The results of this investigation will be beneficial for furthering our understanding of S-T coupling processes, and improving medium-range forecasting skill through use of stratospheric data. This work forms part of a three-and-a-half year PhD project with potential links to the ongoing SPARC Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP). This work uses data from ERA-interim reanalysis and climate models of varying complexity. The data has been zonally averaged, and geopotential height values from the data are interpolated across pressure levels to produce pressure values at a set of defined heights. From a composite of deseasonalised data of the polar cap (65-90 degrees), it was discovered that a maximal stratospheric anomaly of increased pressure occurs between 12 and 20 km, with a similar structure in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Concurrently, this influx of mass seems to induce polewards air flow in the troposphere, creating an area of stored atmospheric mass in the column of air above the pole. This phenomenon is present in the wintertime during the period of ERA-interim, and is recreated with good accuracy in CMIP5 models; a similar shape and magnitude are clearly reproduced, and models with a high top (> 50 km) perform best. These occurrences follow a pattern which is similar to the Northern and Southern Annular Modes, and can be quantified by a comparative index.",

            "abstract": "Thinning of the ice sheet that drains into the Amundsen Sea is currently the major contribution of Antarctica to sea level rise. Acceleration of the outflow glaciers and inland thinning of the ice are now well-documented, but our understanding of the underlying causes remains rudimentary. The observations that thinning is most rapid at the coast and propagates inland suggest that changes in ocean-forced melt of the ice shelves are responsible. However, a critical question that remains unanswered is whether current changes are a continuing response to an earlier trigger, or are driven by current ocean variability.\nIt has been argued that atmospheric circulation changes associated with sea surface temperature variability over the central tropical Pacific Ocean could drive changes in ocean conditions along the Amundsen Sea coast. That conclusion was based on a coarse-resolution model, some results of which now appear questionable. However, observational evidence is supportive of such a link with the tropical Pacific, a pronounced cooling of the Amundsen Sea in 2012 being linked with cool La Nina conditions in the cental Pacific.\nWe critically re-evalute the evidence for such a link with large-scale atmospheric forcing and explore the implications using an ice sheet/shelf model forced by a new parematerisation of melting in response to prescribed ocean temperatures. In particular, we test the hypothesis that initial retreat of Pine Island Glacier from a prominent seabed ridge coincided with a period of exceptional warmth in the central tropical Pacific that had a major impact on West Antarctic atmospheric circulation in the early 1940s. We investigate the magnitude and duration of the 1940’s warm event required to start the retreat of the grounding line, and address the question of whether that trigger is the primary cause of current change, or whether more recent warmth has been critical in driving continuing retreat of the grounding line.",

            "abstract": "Metamorphic soles are m to ~500m thick tectonic slices welded beneath most large ophiolites. They correspond to highly to mildly deformed portions of oceanic lithosphere metamorphosed at amphibolite to granulite facies peak conditions. Metamorphic soles are interpreted as formed ≤1–2Ma after intraoceanic subduction initiation by heat transfer from the hot, incipient mantle wegde to the underthrusting lower plate. Their early accretion and exhumation together with the future ophiolite implies at least one jump of the subduction plate interface from above to below the metamorphic sole. Metamorphic soles thus represent one of the few remnants of the very early evolution of the subduction plate interface and provide major constraints on the thermal structure and the effective rheology of the crust and mantle along the nascent slab interface.We herein present a structural and petrological detailed description of the Oman and Turkey metamorphic soles. Both soles present a steep inverted metamorphic structure, with isograds subparallel to the peridotite contact, in which the proportion of mafic rocks, pressure and temperature conditions increase upward. They comprise, as most metamorphic soles worldwide, two main units: (1) a high-grade unit adjacent to the overlying peridotite composed of granulitized to amphibolized metabasalts, with rare metasedimentary interlayers (~800±100ºC at 10±2kbar) and (2) a low-grade greenschist facies unit composed of metasedimentary rocks with rare metatuffs (~500±100ºC at 5±2kbar). We provide for the first time refined P–T peak condition estimations by means of pseudosection modelling and maximum temperature constraints for the Oman low-grade sole by RAMAN thermometry. In order to quantify micro-scale deformations trough the sole, we also present EBSD data on the Oman garnet-bearing and garnet-free high-grade sole.With these new constraints, we finally propose a new conceptual mechanical model for metamorphic sole formation. This model excludes the presence of a continuous inverted metamorphic gradient through the sole but implies the stacking of several homogeneous slivers to constitute the present structure of the sole. These successive thrusts are the result of rheological changes as the plate interface progressively cools.",

            "abstract": "A CO2-carbonic acid system biogeochemical box model (CRESCAM, Coral Reef and Sediment Carbonate Model) of the barrier reef flat in Kaneohe Bay, Hawai‘i was developed to determine how increasing temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) content of open ocean source waters, resulting from rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions and ocean acidification, affect the CaCO3budget of coral reef ecosystems. CRESCAM consists of 17 reservoirs and 59 fluxes, including a surface water column domain, a two-layer permeable sediment domain, and a coral framework domain. Physical, chemical, and biological processes such as advection, carbonate precipitation/dissolution, and net ecosystem production and calcification were modeled. The initial model parameters were constrained by experimental and field data from previous coral reef studies, mostly in Kaneohe Bay over the past 50 years. The field studies include data collected by our research group for both the water column and sediment-porewater system.\nThe model system, initially in a quasi-steady state condition estimated for the early 21st century, was perturbed using future projections to the year 2100 of the Anthropocene of atmospheric CO2 ­concentrations, temperature, and source water DIC. These perturbations were derived from the most recent (2013) IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which predict CO2 atmospheric concentrations and temperature anomalies out to 2100. A series of model case studies were also performed whereby one or more parameters (e.g., coral calcification response to declining surface water pH) were altered to investigate potential future outcomes. Our model simulations predict that although the Kaneohe Bay barrier reef will likely see a significant decline in NEC over the coming century, it is unlikely to reach a state of net erosion – a result contrary to several global coral reef model projections. In addition, we show that depending on the future response of NEP and NEC to OA and rising temperatures, the surface waters could switch from being a present-day source of CO2 to the atmosphere to a future sink. This ecosystem specific model can be applied to any reef system where data are available to constrain the initial model state and is a powerful tool for examining future changes in coral reef carbon budgets.",

            "abstract": "A shallow earthquake (Mw 6.2) occurred on November 22 in the northern Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. Aftershock area is located near the Kamishiro fault, which is a part of the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL). ISTL is one of the major tectonic boundaries in Japan. Precise aftershock distribution and heterogeneous structure in and around the source region of this earthquake is important to constrain the process of earthquake occurrence. We conducted a high-density seismic array observation in and around source area to investigate aftershock distribution and crustal structure. One hundred sixty-three seismic stations, approximately 1 km apart, were deployed during the period from December 3, 2014 to December 21, 2014. Each seismograph consisted of a 4.5 Hz 3-component seismometer and a digital data recorder (GSX-3). Furthermore, the seismic data at 40 permanent stations were incorporated in our analysis. During the seismic array observation, the Japan Meteorological Agency located 977 earthquakes in a latitude range of 35.5°–37.1°N and a longitude range of 136.7°–139.0°E, from which we selected 500 local events distributed uniformly in the study area. To investigate the aftershock distribution and the crustal structure, the double-difference tomography method [Zhang and Thurber, 2003] was applied to the P- and S-wave arrival time data obtained from 500 local earthquakes. The relocated aftershock distribution shows a concentration on a plane dipping eastward in the vicinity of the mainshock hypocenter. The large slip region (asperity) estimated from InSAR analysis [GSI, 2014] corresponds to the low-activity region of the aftershocks. The depth section of Vp structure shows that the high Vp zone corresponds to the large slip region. These results suggest that structural heterogeneities in and around the fault plane may have controlled the rupture process of the 2014 northern Nagano Prefecture earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The Enstatite chondrite model for the Earth, as envisaged by Marc Javoy and colleagues, has strengths and weaknesses. The overwhelming evidence against layered mantle scenarios makes the existing enstatite Earth models unacceptable. Increasingly, stable and radiogenic isotope data for the Earth and the range of chondrites find that many (but not all) isotopic ratios are shared between the Earth and enstatite chondrites. This significant amount of overlap in isotope space compels one to reconsider the enstatite chondrite model for the Earth.\nDuring early solar system formation (circa +1 Ma) radial inward migration of the Jupiter and Saturn in the disk (e.g., Grand Tack model) would fully disrupted an asteroid belt, resulting in mixing and redistribution of preexisting components, while much later after the disk is gone (e.g., +100 Ma) gravitational scattering by these planets may have transported small bodies from the outer reaches of the solar system inward towards the rocky planets (Nice model).\nAstromineralogy reveals variations in the proportion of olivine to pyroxene in accretion disks, some with inner disk regions being richer in olivine relative to the disk wide composition, while other disks show the abundance of olivine is greater in the outer (vs the inner) part of the circumstellar disk, with differences in disk mineralogy being relating to type of star (e.g., T Tauri vs Herbig Ae/Be stars). The inner disk regions (a few AU) show higher abundances of large grains and generally higher crystallinity as compared to outer disk regions, suggesting grain growth occurs more rapidly in the inner disk regions.\nRecent results from geoneutrino measurements are most consistent with geochemical models that predict 20 TW of radiogenic power, less so with existing enstatite Earth models predicting less power in the planet.\nAt 1 AU the Earth accreted a greater proportion of olivine to pyroxene (i.e., Mg/Si of pyrolite) than that available to the known enstatite chondrite parent body. The Earth accreted early in a reduced state, perhaps to the point of differentiating silicides into the core. Later accreted material was increasingly more oxidized. Stirring and mixing in the early solar system created opportunities for the Earth and enstatite chondrites to share some, but not all chemical and isotopic characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The auroral acceleration region is an integral link in the chain of events that transpire during substorms, and the currents, plasma and electric fields undergo significant changes driven by complex dynamical processes deep in the magnetotail. The acceleration processes that occur therein accelerate and heat the plasma that ultimately leads to some of the most intense global substorm auroral displays. Though this region has garnered considerable attention, the temporal evolution of field-aligned current systems, associated acceleration processes, and resultant changes in the plasma constituents that occur during key stages of substorm development remain unclear. In this study we present a survey of Cluster traversals within and just above the auroral acceleration region (≤3 Re altitude) during substorms. Particular emphasis is on the spatial morphology and developmental sequence of auroral acceleration current systems, potentials and plasma constituents, with the aim of identifying controlling factors, and assessing auroral emmission consequences. Exploiting multi-point measurements from Cluster in combination with auroral imaging, we reveal the injection powered, Alfvenic nature of both the substorm onset and expansion of auroral particle acceleration. We show evidence that indicates substorm onsets are characterized by the gross-intensification and filamentation/striation of pre-existing large-scale current systems to smaller/dispersive scale Alfven waves. Such an evolutionary sequence has been suggested in theoretical models or single spacecraft data, but has not been demonstrated or characterized in multispacecraft observations until now. It is also shown how the Alfvenic variations over time may dissipate to form large-scale inverted-V structures characteristic of the quasi-static aurora. These findings suggest that, in addition to playing active roles in driving substorm aurora, inverted-V and Alfvenic acceleration processes are causally linked. Key elements of substorm current spatial structure and temporal development, relationship to electric fields/potentials, plasma moment and distribution features, causal linkages to auroral emission features, and other properties will be discussed.",

An objective of the project is to design, adapt, and test non-seismic monitoring methods that have not been systematically utilized to date for monitoring CO2 storage projects, and to integrate the data from these various monitoring tools to obtain quantitative estimates of the change in subsurface fluid distributions, pressure changes and associated surface deformation. Monitoring methods being applied include satellite-, surface- and wellbore-based monitoring systems and comprise natural- and controlled-source electromagnetic methods, gravity monitoring, continuous GPS, synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), tiltmeter array analysis, and chemical tracer studies. Here we focus on the GPS, InSAR and gravity monitoring. Five monitoring sites were installed in 2012 and another six in 2013, each including GPS and InSAR corner reflector monuments (some collocated on the same monument). The continuous GPS data from these stations have been processed on a daily basis in both baseline processing mode using the Bernese GPS Software and precise point positioning mode using CSRS-PPP. Gravity measurements at each site have also been performed in fall 2013, spring 2014 and fall 2015, and at two sites in fall 2014. InSAR measurements of deformation have been obtained for a 5 m footprint at each site as well as at the corner reflector point sources. Here we present the first results of this geodetic deformation monitoring after commencement of CO2 injection on April 14, 2015. The time series of these sites are examined, compared and analyzed with respect to monument stability, seasonal signals, longer term trends, and any changes in motion and mass since CO2 injection.",

An M7 or greater (M7+) earthquake in this area at present has high potential to produce devastating serious loss of life and property with even greater global economic repercussions. The Central Disaster Management Council of Japan estimates that an M7+ earthquake will cause 23,000 fatalities and 95 trillion yen (about 1 trillion US$) economic loss. We have launched the Special Project for Reducing Vulnerability for Urban Mega Earthquake Disasters in collaboration with scientists, engineers, and social-scientists in nationwide institutions since 2012. We analyze data from the dense seismic array called Metropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net), which has 296 seismic stations with spacing of 5 km (Sakai and Hirata, 2009; Kasahara et al., 2009). We applied the double-difference tomography method (Zhang and Thurber, 2003) and estimated the velocity structure and the upper boundary of PSP (Nakagawa et al., 2010). The 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (M9.0) has activated seismicity also in Kanto region, providing better coverage of ray paths for tomographic analysis. We obtain much higher resolution velocity models from whole dataset observed by MeSO-net between 2008 and 2015. A detailed image of tomograms shows that PSP contacts Pacific plate at a depth of 50 km beneath northern Tokyo bay. A variation of velocity along the oceanic crust suggests dehydration reaction to produce seismicity in a slab, which may related to the M7+ earthquake.\nAcknowledgement: This study was supported by the Special Project for Reducing Vulnerability for Urban Mega Earthquake Disasters of MEXT, Japan and the Earthquake Research Institute cooperative research program.",

The quantification of flood risk ideally considers the complete risk chain, from the atmospheric processes, through the catchment and river system processes to the damage mechanisms in the affected areas. For a given flood risk system, a multitude of changes can occur along this risk chain possibly affecting flood risk. Hence, it is important to understand how changes in different risk components affect the spatio-temporal distribution of risk. Applying a flood risk model chain to German case studies, we analyze how changes propagate along the risk chain. We discuss how they influence different parts of the risk curve, for example, whether a certain change has a similar influence on low probability/high impact events and high probability/low impact events. This is important information for risk-based design and risk management.",

With respect to increasing risks related to global change, the concept of ecosystem services has a capacity to contribute to safety of both, social and natural systems and vulnerability reduction. Here we study the role of the pool of ecosystem services in terms of flood mitigation and vulnerability reduction model, in a deltaic margins of the European coast (the complex land-sea system of the Waddenzee, comprising the Netherland inner coast and the islands, North Sea) then applicable to a wide variety of deltaic regions in developing areas. Extensive tidal mud flats, saltmarshes, dune ridges and sandy spits between the mainland and the chain of islands, support valuable sediment and primary production regulation along the seaside of these ecosystems. The system includes an incentive ecosystem structure (dune system) whereby economic agents would choose development activities that reduce vulnerability (flooding protection and erosion prevention) as well as satisfy production objectives (recreation and tourism).\nVulnerability values extracted using remote sensing processors represent an innovative development of systems and methodologies. Using remote sensing observations, we investigate the distribution of spatial vegetation and substrate patterns controlled by changes in environmental variables acting on deltas, and we speculate the conditions under which the Real Elementary area can be defined.",

            "abstract": "The PRIDE project aims to understand the processes of continental rift initiation and evolution by analyzing along-axis trends in the southern portion of the East Africa Rift System, from Botswana through Zambia and Malawi. The SEISORZ active-source seismic component of PRIDE focused on the Okavango Rift Zone (ORZ) in northwestern Botswana, with the main goal of imaging the crustal structure across the ORZ. This will allow us to estimate total crustal extension, determine the pattern and amount of thinning, assess the possible presence of melt within the rift zone, and assess the contrasts in crustal blocks across the rift, which closely follows the trend of a fold belt. In November 2014 we conducted a crustal-scale, 450-km-long seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profile consisting of 19 sources (shots in 30-m-deep boreholes) spaced ~25 km apart from each other, and 900 receivers (IRIS/PASSCAL “Texan” dataloggers and 4.5Hz geophones) with ~500 m spacing. From NW to SE, the profile crosses several tectonic domains: the Congo craton, the Damara metamorphic belt and the Ghanzi-Chobe fold belt where the axis of the ORZ is located, and continues into the Kalahari craton. The record sections display clear crustal refraction (Pg) and wide-angle Moho reflection (PmP) phases for all 17 of the good-quality shots, and a mantle refraction arrival (Pn), with the Pg-PmP-Pn triplication appearing at 175 km offset. There are distinct changes in the traveltime and amplitude of these phases along the transect, and on either side of the axis, that seem to correlate with sharp transitions across tectonic terrains. Initial modeling suggests: (1) the presence of a sedimentary half-graben structure at the rift axis beneath the Okavango delta, bounded to the SE by the Kunyere-Thamalakane fault system; (2) faster crustal Vp in the domains to the NW of the ORZ; and (3) thicker crust (45-50 km) at both ends of the profile within the Congo and Kalahari craton domains than at the ORZ and beneath the fold belts. At the meeting we will present results based on forward modeling of the traveltimes of sedimentary, crustal, and mantle phases.",

            "abstract": "Since 1952, the clean-ice Glacier Blanc has retreated twice as fast as the adjacent debris-covered Glacier Noir. Located in the French Alps and separated by only 1 km, both glaciers experience the same climatic conditions, making them ideal to evaluate the impact of debris cover on glacier evolution. We used aerial photographs from 16 acquisitions from 1952 to 2013 to reconstruct and analyze glacier elevation changes using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques. Here, we present the process of developing sub-metric resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from these aerial photographs. By combining 16 DEMs, we produced a dataset of elevation changes of Glacier Noir and Glacier Blanc, including time-series analysis of lateral and longitudinal profiles, glacier hypsometry and mass balance variation. Our preliminary results indicate that Glacier Noir and Glacier Blanc have both thinned to a similar magnitude, ≤ 20 m, despite a 1 km retreat for Glacier Blanc and only 500 m for Glacier Noir. However, these elevation change reconstructions are hampered by large uncertainties, principally due to the lack of independent camera calibration on the historical imagery. Initial attempts using posteriori correction grids have proven to significantly increase the accuracy of these data. We will present some of the uncertainties and solutions linked to the use of SfM on such a large scale and on such an old dataset.\nThis study demonstrates how SfM can be used to investigate long-term trends in environmental change, allowing glacier monitoring to be up-scaled. It also highlights the need for on-going validation of methods to increase the accuracy and precision of SfM in glaciology. This work is not only advancing our understanding of the role of the debris layer, but will also aid glacial geology more generally with, for example, detailed geomorphological analysis of proglacial terrain and Quaternary sciences with quick and accurate reconstruction of a glacial paleo-environment.",

            "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts during the last four decades, no primordial signature of lunar xenon has been found. In order to further investigate the possible occurrence of indigenous volatiles in the Moon, we have analysed the noble gas and nitrogen isotopic compositions in two different sets of samples. Vacuum crushing of highly vesicular (~50% by volume) basalt 15016 (3.4 b.y. old, 300 m.y. exposure age) releases large amounts of spallation-produced gases that overshadow any other component. Lunar anorthosites 60025, 60215 and 65315 have the lowest exposure duration (~2m.y.) among Apollo samples. Consequently, they contain only limited cosmogenic (e.g. 124,126Xe) and solar wind noble gases. Furthermore, anorthosite is poor in U and Pu, leading to negligible contribution of fissiogenic Xe isotopes. These properties make these samples ideal for searching for lunar primordial noble gases. As observed in previous studies [1-3], lunar anorthosite Xe presents an isotopic composition very close to that of terrestrial atmosphere, which has been previously attributed to \"abnormal adsorption\" of terrestrial Xe after sample return. This presumed atmospheric Xe contamination can only be removed by heating the samples at medium to high temperature under vacuum, and is therefore different from common adsorption. In order to investigate this abnormal adsorption, uncrushed gravels of lunar anorthosite were exposed to a neutral Xe-rich atmosphere. Infrared reflectance spectrometry of processed, and unprocessed, samples shows a shift in the anorthosite's peak of the former, possibly corresponding to chemical Xe bonding. This phenomenon could explain the difficulties met for forty years when investigating a lunar primordial xenon component in anorthosites. However, our high precision Xe isotope analysis shows a systematic trend toward depletion in the heavy Xe isotopes (134Xe and 136Xe) not seen before. This leads us to make a tantalising parallel between the indigenous component in theses samples and primordial U-Xe [4], inferred on theoretical ground to be the precursor of atmospheric Xe but never clearly identified.

DPR algorithm has left a lot of research. Non-uniform Beam Filiing (NUBF) among them seems to be an important issue in order to improve the observation accuracy. According to Iguchi et.al (2009), the NUBF correction which has been introduced into TRMM / PR algorithms, Path Integrated Attenuation (PIA) is then assumed to be gamma distribution, and calculates the correction parameters. In this study, the validity of the NUBF correction using the gamma distribution was verified using ground based radar data. In addition, it was also verification of NUBF correction method using the footprint of KaPR that have been added in the DPR algorithm.\nVerification data used the high resolution ground based radar data than the TRMM / PR and DPR. This is to obtain detailed precipitation echo data in the observation footprint. Using this data, we calculated the coefficient of variation sn of PIA in the observation footprint. The value of sn calculated by the observation footprint was true value in this study. Estimation method of sn is two-fold. One method of calculating the sn is considered as a fractal shapes the 3 × 3 pixels including the observation footprint contained in TRMM / PR Algorithm, the other is the footprint of KaPR closer to the observation footprint (2 × 2 pixels). Result of the verification, the NUBF correction method TRMM / PR Algorithm (3 × 3 pixels), it was found to be overestimated as compared to sn of the true value. Moreover, the sn estimation using the footprint (2 × 2 pixels) of KaPR, the difference between the true values becomes smaller. Furthermore, as compared with the case of using the correction method TRMM / PR algorithm, sn estimate was found to be better.\nThe results, in NUBF correction techniques on DPR, we propose the use of footprint KaPR (2 × 2 pixels).",

            "abstract": "The Pliocene warm period (PWP) (5.3-2.6 Ma) is a common analog for a future, warmer world. The nature of El Niño Sothern Oscillation (ENSO) during the PWP is the subject of debate, with conflicting models and centennial-scale marine core proxy data suggesting either a (1) persistent El Niño-like state (Wara et al., 2005, Science v.309, p.758) or (2) persistent La Niña-like state (Rickaby and Halloran, 2005, Science v.307, p.1948). Alternatively, a sub-annually-resolved oxygen isotopic time series of a pristine fossil coral from the western Pacific identified PWP sea surface temperature variability consistent with modern ENSO conditions (Watanabe et al., 2011, Nature v.471, p.209). No similar analysis has been performed on pristine PWP corals from the eastern Pacific. Because prior to ~2.7 Ma the Central American Seaway (CAS) allowed Pacific waters to flow into the Caribbean Sea, ENSO signals could have been propagated directly into the Caribbean.\nPristine corals from the latest Miocene now found in the Dominican Republic have been previously dated using U-Pb techniques (5.5±0.1 Ma) and analyzed for oxygen and carbon isotope values (Denniston et al., 2008, Geology v.36, p.151). We have micromilled at ~15 samples/year adjacent sections of the previously analyzed corallite, thereby extending this stable isotope record to 27 years in length. Following the methods used by Watanabe et al. (2011), the seasonal cycle in these oxygen isotopes was deconvolved and positive and negative departures were identified. This record suggests that anomalous winter sea surface temperatures occurred at intervals consistent with modern ENSO behavior. These findings should be integrated into paleoceanographic models of the CAS at 5.5 Ma to better understand their connection to ENSO. Future research will lengthen this record, further clarifying the state of PWP ENSO.",

            "abstract": "Recent work has shown that marine sectors of the remaining ice sheets could exhibit rapid deglaciation linked to potential changes in oceanic forcing factors. Our ability to identify potential causes of marine ice sheet instability is limited by the scarcity of suitable analogues from the palaeo-record where evidence of rapid deglaciation can be linked to changes in the various potential forcing factors.\nOf the former Pleistocene ice sheets, the British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) provides a useful analogue with large amounts of previous work providing detailed contextual information. Its western margin was marine terminating and drained by numerous fast flowing ice streams while its position next to a major surficial artery of the Atlantic Meridionial Overturning Circulation (AMOC) rendered it potentially sensitive to small climatic perturbations.\nHere we present new cosmogenic exposure ages that constrain the collapse of a marine sector of the former British and Irish Ice Sheet to ca. 20 ka. By comparing our new terrestrial dating constraints to proximal marine sediment records, including a new δ18ONps record, we are able to untangle the possible forcing mechanisms of this instability. The collapse occurs during an interval of generally cold surface conditions without significant large-scale oceanic reorganization. Increased calving driven by an increase in surface melt provides an alternative potential mechanism to link marine ice sheet instability to an increase in summer air temperature driven by rising boreal insolation after 23 ka suggesting potential hypersensitivity to small forcings with implications for understanding the vulnerability of marine sectors of remaining ice sheets.",

            "abstract": "Internal gravity waves are widely recognized to contribute significantly to the energy and angular momentum transport. They play a significant role in affecting many of the middle atmospheric phenomena (like the QBO or Brewer-Dobson circulation). Using GPS RO density profiles, we have discovered a localized area of enhanced IGW activity and breaking in the lower stratosphere of Eastern Asia/North-western Pacific region.\nWith a 3D primitive equation model of the middle atmosphere we studied the effects of such a localized breaking region on large-scale dynamics and transport. Enhancing artificially a gravity wave drag in the lover stratosphere of the EA/NP region we show that such a localized IGW forcing creates planetary waves propagating both equatorward and poleward and upward along the edge of the polar vortex. Possible consequences for the polar vortex stability and stratosphere-troposphere exchange in the tropical region are discussed.\nFinally, applying 3D wave activity flux and 3D residual circulation diagnostics, we investigated the possible role of this area in the longitudinal variability of the Brewer- Dobson circulation with a hypothesis of its enhanced downwelling branch in this region. In the process, model results were compared with the ozone and tracer distribution data from GOME, GOMOS, MIPAS and SCIAMACHY further confirming an importance of the Eastern Asia/North-western Pacific region for the middle atmospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Earth conditions in the Precambrian, and their effect upon the formation of cratons and orogenies from that era, are not fully understood. For example, the precise onset of modern plate tectonics remains ambiguous; it has been hypothesised to have begun anywhere from ~4.1Ga (Hopkins, 2008) to ~1Ga (Stern, 2005). Also, the exceptional depth to which fast wave-speed and geoid anomalies extend beneath some cratons points to the existence of thick “cratonic keels”, the origin of which remains unexplained. To improve our understanding of the early Earth processes, geological evidence preserved within ancient plates that have remained largely unchanged since the Precambrian can be used. The rocks of northern Hudson Bay include Archean domains, the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO), and lie atop one of the largest cratonic keels on Earth (Bastow et al., 2013), making this region an ideal laboratory for study of Precambrian processes.\nHere, we use seismological data recorded at Canadian POLARIS and Hudson Bay Lithospheric Experiment (HuBLE) stations to perform a relative arrival-time study of northern Hudson Bay region and the THO. Waveforms are aligned using the adaptive stacking routine of Rawlinson et al. (2004), and inversions are produced using the Fast Marching Tomography (FMTOMO) inversion code of Rawlinson et al. (2006). Our inversions provide an improved velocity model of the lithosphere and upper mantle of northern Canada, suggesting updated boundaries between lithospheric blocks at mantle depths and constituting new body-wave constraints on their structure. The results are used to address a number of outstanding questions regarding the processes that formed the THO and the Laurentian Keel of North America.",

            "abstract": "We model the evolution of Vestre Svartisen. Vestre Svartisen is located in northern Norway and is the second largest ice cap in Norway with an area of 218 km2. There is an abundance of in-situ observations for this ice cap as a result of the monitoring programs in relation to hydro-power generation. Based on these in-situ observations, we can use the case of Vestre Svartisen to test the performance of glacier evolution modeling based on remote sensing, that provides data on glacier volume and surface velocity changes, instead of in-situ observations that only are available for a limited number of glaciers world-wide. The in-situ observations at Vestre Svartisen include mass balance observations since 1970 on Engabreen catchment and 10 mass balance years on Storglombreen, a glacier length record of Engabreen back to 1600, outlines of the ice cap in 1968, 1988 and 1999, ice thickness observations, and surface velocity measurements. In addition to these in-situ observations, we derive glacier volume and surface velocity changes from ASTER and Landsat imagery, respectively. We model the surface mass balance (SMB) and the ice dynamics using a simplified energy balance model coupled to a vertically integrated shallow ice approximation 2D glacier flow model. The mass balance model is forced with temperature and precipitation measurements from a nearby weather station at Glomfjord. The SMB model is calibrated on individual stake measurements of winter and summer mass balance over the period 1990--2010 in the Engabreen catchment. The bed topography is reconstructed from iteratively matching modeled and observed surface elevation, and the reconstruction reproduces the observed large ice thickness east of the highest point of the ice cap of about 650 m well. We use the calibrated model to reconstruct the 20th century evolution of the Svartisen ice cap and its fate under the projected climate change in the 21st century. In addition, we explore the possibilities of calibrating the glacier model with only remotely sensed volume and velocity changes such that the model framework can be applied to glaciers for which no in-situ observations are available.",

            "abstract": "Warming in arctic tundra may thaw currently frozen upper permafrost layers, potentially releasing organic carbon (C) that was preserved by cold conditions for hundreds or thousands of years. Apart from the direct control of temperature on permafrost carbon dioxide (CO2) production, warming may alter permafrost CO2 production rates through changes in either permafrost C quality or changes in microbial communities. We incubated exogenous permafrost cores in four different warming experiments in NE-Greenland. The experiments were located in both Salix- and Cassiope-dominated sub-sites and were established in 2004 (old site) and 2007 (new site). Permafrost cores were buried as “open incubators” (free vertical water flow) at both 5-10cm depth (shallow) and 15-20cm depth (deep) in both non-manipulated (control) and warmed plots (warmed) and incubated for 2 years in the field. After retrieval from the field, permafrost cores were kept undisturbed in a lab fridge for three months, after which sub-samples were incubated at 5°C in glass vials. Permafrost CO2 production rates were subsequently measured after one week, four weeks and three months incubation in the lab. We measured the legacy effects of in situ conditions, including experimental warming in the field, on permafrost respiration under controlled laboratory conditions. We assessed the effects of plot type, vegetation type, experiment age, and incubation depth on permafrost CO2 production rates. After 3 months incubation in the lab, we measured a positive effect of warming on permafrost CO2 production rates for shallow-incubated cores, but not for deep-incubated cores. Production rates of CO2 were significantly higher for cores incubated in the old site compared to the new site. Our results suggest that warming may not only directly stimulate permafrost C release, but also indirectly through the effects of infiltrating water, nutrients and microbes from near-surface soil layers.",

This can be provided by vulnerability maps which allow better visual presentations and understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities. Local implementers can direct the resources needed for protection of these areas. Moreover, vulnerability and hazard maps are relevant in all phases of disaster management designed by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Council (NDRRMC) - disaster preparedness, prevention and mitigation and response and recovery and rehabilitation. This paper aims to analyze the vulnerability of Catanduanes, a coastal province in the Philippines, to storm surges in terms of four parameters: population, built environment, natural environment and agricultural production. The vulnerability study relies on the storm surge inundation maps based on the Department of Science and Technology Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards’ (DOST-Project NOAH) proposed four Storm Surge Advisory (SSA) scenarios (1-2, 3, 4, and 5 meters) for predicting storm surge heights. To determine total percent affected for each parameter elements, an overlay analysis was performed in ArcGIS Desktop. Moreover, vulnerability and hazard maps are generated as a final output and a tool for visualizing the impacts of storm surge event at different surge heights. The result of this study would help the selected province to know their present condition and adapt strategies to strengthen areas where they are found to be most vulnerable in order to prepare better for the future.",

            "abstract": "On Piton de la Fournaise volcano, La Reunion island, continuous seismic recordings allow to extract signals associated to rockfalls occuring inside the Dolomieu crater. Using the OVPF catalog, we have investigated these seismic signals in order to find how their characteristics could relate to physical characteristics of rockfalls. Here, we analyze such seismic signals from a statistical viewpoint. Data are first taken on an 8 month period that includes an eruption, from January to August 2014. For all the seismic signals associated to rockfalls in this period, 14 seismic and physical attributes are retrieved, allowing to perform a statistical method known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is processed three times in this study : firstly with the 14 attributes, to highlight the main features that outline the data – which we find to be duration and seismic energy, as well as waveform and frequency content. The second PCA, based on 6 attributes, leads to the definition of several physical types of rockfalls, based on the k-means clustering method. Lastly, PCA and k-means clustering are done on 6 different, easily-computed seismic attributes, and reveal a specific behavior of one cluster of events just before the June 20th eruption. Based on this finding, 15 easily-retrievable numerical attributes are defined from the specific cluster pointed out in the 2014 study, and tested on 2 other datasets : from January to July 2015, they detect the approach of the February 4th, May 17th and July 31st eruptions. From August to December 2010, our attributes show precursory variations a few days before the October 14th and December 9th eruptions. We highlight the increase in a specific type of seismic events shortly before an eruption ; we believe they rather have a volcano-tectonic source but hardly distinguish themselves from rockfalls on seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "Woody plants play an important role in drylands primary productivity and peoples' livelihood, however, due to their scattered appearance, quantifying and monitoring their abundance over a large area is challenging. From in situ measured woody cover we develop a phenology driven model to estimate the canopy cover of woody species in the Sahelian drylands. Annual maps are applied to monitor dynamics of woody populations in relation to climate and anthropogenic interference. The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept is based on the significant difference in phenophases of dryland trees, shrubs and bushes as compared to that of the herbaceous plants. Whereas annual herbaceous are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) seasonal metrics representing the dry season to reproduce in situ woody cover at 77 field sites (178 observations in 3x3 km plots between 2000 and 2014) in Niger, Mali and Senegal. The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD44B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. Trends over 15 years show that the pattern is closely related to population density and land cover/use. A negative woody cover change can be observed in densely populated areas, but a positive change is seen in sparsely populated regions. Whereas woody cover in cropland is generally stable, it is strongly positive in savannas and woodland. Discrepancies between the countries are huge and also deforestation can be observed at a more local scale. The method is applicable and derived woody cover maps of the Sahel are freely available. They represent an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of drylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, research on deforestation/degradation as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.",

            "abstract": "During the shut-in stage of hydraulic fracturing, aperture decreases, which traps proppant between the fracture walls. The resulting proppant distribution determines the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture. If proppant is uniformly distributed throughout the fracture, proppant permeability dictates the resulting fracture conductivity. However, if proppant is distributed in isolated islands surrounded by proppant-free regions, fracture conductivity may be enhanced. Optimizing the creation of such islands requires a quantitative understanding of the factors (normal stress, solid concentration, carrier fluid composition) that control the distribution of proppant and its evolution during closure. We use a 15 x 15-cm bench-scale transparent fracture that allows fracture closure by applying normal stress to quantify the distribution of proppant between the fracture walls after shut-in. Eight actuators apply a constant force to an aluminum frame supporting the fracture surfaces and four LVDTs measure displacements. Preliminary constant-normal-stress experiments (closed inlet and outlet) show a direct correlation between the force applied by the actuators and the fluid pressure. Furthermore, for some fluid-solid combinations, proppant in the constant-aperture fracture develop isolated islands surrounded by open regions. In the absence of a confining stress, these open regions may be mobilized during flow-back, so ongoing experiments measure the evolution of these proppant islands during shut-in and flow-back at increased normal stress. Our experiments provide mechanistic insights to proppant pack evolution necessary for optimizing fracture conductivity enhancement during and after fracture shut-in.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is the principle driver of anthropogenic climate change. Asia is an important region for the global carbon budget, with four of the world’s ten largest national emitters of CO2, but it is also a region with considerable uncertainty in both anthropogenic emissions and land biosphere fluxes of CO2. Furthermore, Asia has undergone rapid economic growth over the past two decades, which has been associated with large increases in fossil fuel emissions, 190% for India and 240% for China between 1990 and 2010.\nWe have used an ensemble of seven atmospheric CO2 inversions and three standard fossil fuel and cement fluxes, based on the inventories of CDIAC, EDGAR and IEA, to determine the land biosphere fluxes for East, South and Southeast Asia, and to ascertain the robustness and overall uncertainty of the results. We find that the East Asian land biosphere was on average a carbon sink of -0.35 ± 0.37 PgC y-1 (median and MAD), or equivalently 17 ± 18% of East Asia’s fossil fuel and cement emissions, over 1996 – 2012. Between 1996 – 2001 and 2008 – 2012, we find an increase in the sink of 0.74 ± 0.28 PgC y-1, however the magnitude of this is contingent on the assumed increase in fossil fuel emissions. For South Asia, we find that on average the land biosphere was close to carbon neutral, -0.01 ± 0.20 PgC y-1 over 1996 – 2012 and that there was no significant trend. For Southeast Asia, we find no evidence for a trend in the land biosphere flux over 1996 – 2012 and we cannot determine any difference from carbon neutrality (as assumed a priori by most inversions) with a flux of 0.06 ± 0.29 PgC y-1, throughout this period despite extensive tropical deforestation.",

            "abstract": "More than 11 years of the Medium Energy Protons Electrons Detector data from the NOAA polar orbiting satellites were analyzed. Significant electron counting rate fluctuations were evidenced during geomagnetic quiet periods by using a set of adiabatic coordinates. Electron counting rates were compared to earthquakes by defining a seismic event L-shell obtained radially projecting the epicenter geographical positions to a given altitude. Counting rate fluctuations were grouped in every satellite semi-orbit together with strong seismic events and these were chosen with the L-shell coordinates close to each other. Electron data from July 1998 to December 2011 were compared for nearly 1,800 earthquakes with magnitudes larger than or equal to 6, occurring worldwide. When considering 30 - 100 keV energy channels by the vertical NOAA telescopes and earthquake epicenter projections at altitudes greater that 1,300 km, a 4 sigma correlation appeared where time of particle precipitations Tpp occurred 2 – 3 hour prior time of large seismic events Teq. This was in physical agreement with different correlation times obtained from past studies that considered particles with greater energies. The correlation suggested a 4-8 hour advance in preparedness of strong earthquakes influencing the ionosphere. Considering this strong correlation between earthquakes and electron rate fluctuations, and the hypothesis that such fluctuations originated with magnetic disturbances generated underground, a small scale experiment with low cost at ground level is advisable. Plans exists to perform one or more unconventional experiments around an earthquake affected area by private investor in Italy.",

            "abstract": "Lunar surface permittivity is an important parameter for understanding the Moon and has been observed by many radar experiments from spacecraft since 1960s. In these observations, frequencies of radio transmissions are generally high (HF to UHF band) because of instrumental limitations. One of the interesting topics about the lunar surface permittivity is its frequency response in lower bands. It is known that frequency response of permittivity in the low bands can be a good indicator of the moisture content. In theory, there is a considerable difference between the permittivity of dry soil and ice especially below 100 kHz.\nThe lunar orbiter SELENE (Kaguya) carried out radar observations of the lunar subsurface structures and passive observations of natural waves with the Lunar Radar Sounder instrument (LRS). In the passive observations, an electromagnetic wave from the Earth’s auroral region that is called auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) was frequently observed in low frequency (LF) band. An interesting feature of AKR observation from SELENE is that the observed AKR consists of not only waves reached directly from the Earth's auroral region but also waves reflected on the lunar surface. Since such reflections influence polarizations of the observed AKR, we can estimate the lunar surface permittivity for low frequency waves from the comparison between observed polarizations and those theoretically calculated for various parameter sets of the lunar surface. As a result, the observed polarizations are well reconstructed when the permittivity of the lunar surface is assumed to be around 4 to 8 in average. In the presentation, we show the regional distributions of the permittivity that is derived from detailed data analysis and compare them with permittivity map for high frequencies (HF band) that are derived from radar observations from SELENE.",

The prime objective is to federate, support and expand the international research community that the ERS, ENVISAT and the Envelope programmes have built up over the last 25 years. It aims to further strengthen the leadership of the European Earth Observation research community by enabling them to extensively exploit future European operational EO missions. SEOM is enabling the science community to address new scientific research that are opened by free and open access to data from operational EO missions.\nThe Programme is based on community-wide recommendations for actions on key research issues, gathered through a series of international thematic workshops and scientific user consultation meetings such as the Sentinel-3 for Science Workshop held last June in Venice, Italy (see http://seom.esa.int/S3forScience2015). The 2015 SEOM work plan includes the launch of new R&D studies for scientific exploitation of the Sentinels, the development of open-source multi-mission scientific toolboxes, the organization of advanced international training courses, summer schools and educational materials, as well as activities for promoting the scientific use of EO data, also via the organization of Workshops.\nThis paper will report the recommendations from the International Scientific Community concerning the Sentinel-3 Scientific Exploitation, as expressed in Venice, keeping in mind that Sentinel-3 is an operational mission to provide operational services (see http://www.copernicus.eu).",

            "abstract": "The Cascade Arc is the type-locality for a ‘hot’ subduction zone, where the downgoing slab is young and subduction is relatively slow; a unique setting for studying the controls on silicic (>56 wt% SiO2) magma genesis [1,2]. We present high precision Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic and trace element data for silicic lavas and country rocks from the major centres of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB) in British Columbia, which are hosted by the Mesozoic Coast Plutonic Complex and accreted Coast Belt terranes.\nIn isotopic plots, the silicic GVB lavas define mixing curves between northern Cascadia Basin sediment [3] and Juan de Fuca MORB. The silicic GVB lavas have lower ɛNd, and higher ɛHf, 87Sr/86Sr, 208Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb for a given 206Pb/204Pb than co-existing alkalic mafic lavas [2,4] which define a separate isotopic cluster. The alkalic mafic lavas have OIB-like trace element compositions [2,4], but the silicic lavas are calc-alkaline with a typical ‘arc’ trace element signature.\nGeochemical systematics suggest that a mafic, isotopically ‘depleted’ contaminant may be affecting the composition of GVB silicic lavas. However, modelling indicates that slab melts do not constitute a major component of the lavas despite high slab temperatures. Geochemical models also rule out the accreted Coast Belt terranes as an assimilant. However, AFC modelling using 147 Ma Cloudburst quartz diorite [5] as the assimilant can explain both the trace element and isotopic compositional range displayed by GVB silicic magmas, consistent with the Coast Plutonic Complex as a major component of the deep crust in this region. Crustal assimilation would have partially overprinted any alkalic mantle-derived signature of parental magmas, while imparting a calc-alkaline arc signature to resulting silicic magmas.\n [1] Green & Harry (1999) EPSL, 171; [2] Mullen & Weis (2013) G3, 14; [3] Carpentier et al.

            "abstract": "Hydrological modeling in mountainous regions requires unbiaised precipitation estimates at scales of a few hundreds to a few thousands square-kilometers (meso-scale). At these scales, precipitation patterns are complex and exhibit orographic enhancement, a phenomenon which is often poorly captured by scarce gage networks. Usually, the estimation of areal precipitation is performed independently of the hydrological modeling step (e.g. using precipitation reanalysis datasets or gage interpolation products). In this approach, it is not possible to easily correct precipitation biases in the case of discrepancies between observed and simulated discharges. In this study, we introduce the concept of Hydrologically-Aided Interpolation (HAI): a gage-based interpolation scheme, producing gridded daily precipitation estimates, is coupled to a semi-distributed hydrological model running at the daily time-step. The parameters of the interpolation scheme (precipitation gradients with elevation) are estimated jointly with the parameters of the hydrological model (snow scheme, soil moisture accounting scheme, and routing scheme). The whole hydrometeorological model is evaluated against cross-validation precipitation gages, point-scale snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements, and catchment-scale discharge estimates at several streamflow gaging sites in a 3,500 square-kilometer Alpine catchment in the French Southern Alps. Results show that adding hydrological constraints leads to much more robust estimates of precipitation gradients, which in turn produce improved precipitation estimates in temporal cross-validation both at point-scale and catchment-scale.",

            "abstract": "Physical analog models and demonstrations can be effective educational tools for helping instructors teach abstract concepts in the Earth, planetary, and space sciences. Reducing the learning challenges for students using physical analog models and demonstrations, however, can often increase instructors’ workload and budget because the cost and time needed to produce and maintain such curriculum materials is substantial.\nFirst, this presentation describes a working model for the Modeling and Educational Demonstrations Laboratory Curriculum Materials Center (MEDL-CMC) to support instructors’ use of physical analog models and demonstrations in the science classroom. The working model is based on a combination of instructional resource models developed by the Association of College & Research Libraries and by the Physics Instructional Resource Association. The MEDL-CMC aims to make the curriculum materials available for all science courses and outreach programs within the institution where the MEDL-CMC resides. The sustainability and value of the MEDL-CMC comes from its ability to provide and maintain a variety of physical analog models and demonstrations in a wide range of science disciplines.\nSecond, the presentation then reports on the development, progress, and future of the MEDL-CMC at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). Development of the UCLA MEDL-CMC was funded by a grant from UCLA’s Office of Instructional Development and is supported by the Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences. Other UCLA science departments have recently shown interest in the UCLA MEDL-CMC services, and therefore, preparations are currently underway to increase our capacity for providing interdepartmental service.\nThe presentation concludes with recommendations and suggestions for other institutions that wish to start their own MEDL-CMC in order to increase educational effectiveness and decrease instructor workload. We welcome an interuniversity collaboration to further develop the MEDL-CMC model.",

Vera developed 895 hPa on offshore and landed with 929.2 hPa. There are many studies of the dynamical downscaling of Vera but it is difficult to simulate accurately because of the lack of the accuracy of global reanalysis data. This study carried out dynamical downscaling experiment of Vera using WRF downscaling forced by JRA-55 that are latest atmospheric model and reanalysis data. In this study, the reproducibility of five global reanalysis data for Typhoon Vera were compered. Comparison shows that reanalysis data doesn’t have strong typhoon information except for JRA-55, so that downscaling with conventional reanalysis data goes wrong. The dynamical downscaling method for storm surge is studied very much (e.g. choice of physical model, nudging, 4D-VAR, bogus and so on). In this study, domain size and resolution of the coarse domain were considered. The coarse domain size influences the typhoon route and central pressure, and larger domain restrains the typhoon strength. The results of simulations with different domain size show that the threshold of developing restrain is whether the coarse domain fully includes the area of wind speed more than 15 m/s around the typhoon. The results of simulations with different resolution show that the resolution doesn't affect the typhoon route, and higher resolution gives stronger typhoon simulation.",

The current generation of Earth System models is unable to simulate interactively these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. We have used offline methodologies to estimate a range of CO2 and methane emissions from permafrost, methane emissions from wetlands, and reduced sequestration of CO2 by nitrogen-limited vegetation under the high-end representative concentration pathway, RCP8.5. By translating these fluxes into increments to the concentration of each gas we have generated a new range of scenarios, exceeding RCP8.5 by up to 266 ppm of CO2 and 732 ppb of methane by 2100. We have used these new scenarios to force the Hadley Centre Earth System model, HadGEM2-ES, over the 21st century. We found that accounting for these feedbacks leads to additional global mean warming of up to 1.5 °C relative to the standard RCP8.5.",

            "abstract": "The Receiver Function (RF) method is a widely applied seismological tool for the imaging of crustal and lithospheric structures beneath a single seismic station with one to tens kilometers of vertical resolution. However, detailed information about the upper crust (0-10 km depth) can also be retrieved by increasing the frequency content of the analyzed RF data-set (with a vertical resolution lower than 0.5km). This information includes depth of velocity contrasts, S-wave velocities within layers, as well as presence and location of seismic anisotropy or dipping interfaces (e.g., induced by faulting) at depth. These observables provides valuable constraints on the structural settings and properties of sedimentary basins both for scientific and industrial applications. To test the RF capabilities for this high resolution application, six broadband seismic stations have been deployed across the southwestern margin of the Dublin Basin (DB), Ireland, whose geothermal potential has been investigated in the last few years. With an inter-station distance of about 1km, this closely spaced array has been designed to provide a clear picture of the structural transition between the margin and the inner portion of the basin.\nIn this study, a Bayesian approach is used to retrieve the posterior probability distributions of S-wave velocity at depth beneath each seismic station. A multi-frequency RF data-set is analyzed and RF and curves of apparent velocity are jointly inverted to better constrain absolute velocity variations. A pseudo 2D section is built to observe the lateral changes in elastic properties across the margin of the basin with a focus in the shallow portion of the crust. Moreover, by means of the harmonic decomposition technique, the azimuthal variations in the RF data-set are isolated and interpreted in terms of anisotropy and dipping interfaces associated with the major fault system in the area. These results are compared with the available information from previous seismic active surveys in the area, including boreholes data.",

These small-scale density structures are consistently correlated with strong fine-scale field-aligned currents. A possible driver of these density enhancements is soft electron precipitation which, through processes associated with ion-outflow, results in a density enhancement in the cusp vicinity at the altitudes observed by CHAMP. We investigate this mechanism with recent observations from the CASSIOPE / e-POP satellite and numerical simulations. In-situ data for selected cusp transit events are presented. Numerical simulation predictions are discussed comparing two electron-precipitation models: a fine-scale ion-outflow model and a global-scale Joule heating / increased conductivity model (CMIT).",

Previous work (Tessein\net al. 2013) found a strong correlation between discontinuities, identified using a normalized vector\nincrement and the intensity of energetic particles measured by ACE/EPAM, based on a superposed\nepoch analysis using over 12 years of data. Here, we examine many individual high-PVI events\nto better understand this association emphasizing intervals selected from data with shock\nneighborhoods removed. We find that in many cases the local maximum in PVI is in a region of\nrising or falling energetic particle intensity, which suggests that magnetic discontinuities may act as\nbarriers inhibiting the motion of energetic particles across them.",

            "abstract": "The Apo Volcanic Complex (AVC) is one of the largest volcanic centers in the Philippines, located in the southern island of Mindanao. It is composed of four edifices and several smaller cones. The youngest volcanic unit, the Apo Dome, is the highest elevation in the Philippines. This unit is classified as potentially active, whereas other units, Talomo, Sibulan and Kitubod, are inactive. The study gives insight to the construction and deformation history of the volcanic units and imparts foresight to subsequent events that can affect populated areas.\nA morphological analysis integrating high-resolution digital terrain models and public domain satellite data and images was done to recognize and discriminate volcanic units and characterize volcano-tectonic features and processes. Morphological domains were defined based on surface textures, slope variation, degrees and controls of erosion, and lineament density and direction. This establishes the relative ages and extent of volcanic units as well as the volcano-tectonic evolution of the complex. Six edifice building events were recognized, two of which form the elevated base of Apo dome.\nThe geodynamic setting of the region is imprinted in the volcanic units as five morphostructural lineaments. They reveal the changes in maximum regional stress through time such as the N-S extension found across the whole volcanic complex displaying the current stress regime. This has implications on the locality and propagation of geothermal activity, magma ascent, and edifice collapses. One main result of the compounded effects of inherited structures and current stress regime is the Sandawa Collapse Zone. This is a large valley formed by several collapses where NE-SW fractures propagate and the increasing lateral spreading by debuttressing continue to eat away the highest peak.\nThe AVC is surrounded by the major metropolitan area of Davao City to the east and the cities of Kidapawan and Digos to the west and south, respectively. In addition, within 3 km of Apo Dome is a geothermal power plant. With the obvious socio-economic significance of the area, it is imperative to understand these deformations that allow structures to propagate, resulting to instability of the edifice and possibly volcanic unrest, and ultimately for the assessment of hazards and risks to the immediate sectors.",

            "abstract": "We discuss the setup and results of an experiment aimed at collecting helicopter-based hyperspectral and photogrammetry measurements over the western Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) for studying the evolution of surface albedo and surface hydrological features. Data were collected during three days at the end of July 2015 concurrently with in-situ hydrological measurements of runoff and discharge of a supraglacial stream (Rio Behar) and along the K-transect up to an elevation of ~ 1500 m a.s.l.\nHyperspectral measurements of incoming and outgoing radiation collected at a radiometric resolution of 10 nm were acquired in conjunction with geo-located images by means of a digital camera mounted on the same platform. Gyroscopes and 3-D accelerometers were also used to estimate the relative orientation of the sensors collecting the incoming and outgoing solar radiation. To our knowledge, despite their importance, it is the first time that such measurements have been collected over the Greenland ice sheet from an airborne platform. The sensors were installed inside a pod that was specifically modified for our purpose. The impact of the helicopter on the recorded incoming radiation was characterized by collecting measurements in the absence and presence of the helicopter when the rotors were either off or on. Moreover, the effect of the relative position of the helicopter with respect to the sun’s position was also quantified by ad-hoc maneuvers during take off and landing with the helicopter spinning around the main rotor axis. The geo-referenced images collected by our instrument provide an unprecedented ground spatial resolution of ~ 6 cm, hence allowing us to study the spatial distribution of surface hydrological features, such as cryoconite holes, small order streams and cracks developing into larger moulins. Such images were also used to evaluate the application of RGB data to estimate streams and lakes surface area and depths.\nOur helicopter-based hyperspectral and photogrammetry measurements provide a first-time dataset for assessing and improving albedo schemes currently used in regional climate models and remote sensing outputs, especially along the margins of the Greenland ice sheet where the relatively coarse spatial resolution of both models outputs and remote sensing products is a limiting factor.",

            "abstract": "Very Low Frequency (VLF) waves have been proposed as an approach to study and monitor the lower ionospheric conditions. The ionospheric perturbations are identified in relation with thunderstorm activity, geomagnetic storm and other factors. The temporal dependence of VLF amplitude has a complicated and large daily variabilities in general due to combinations of both effects from above (space weather effect) and below (atmospheric and crustal processes) of the ionosphere. Quantitative contributions from different external sources are not known well yet. Thus the modelling and prediction of VLF wave amplitude are important issues to study the lower ionospheric responses from various external parameters and to also detect the anomalies of the ionosphere.\nThe purpose of the study is to model and predict nighttime average amplitude of VLF wave propagation from the VLF transmitter in Hawaii (NPM) to receiver in Chofu (CHO) Tokyo, Japan path using NARX neural network. The constructed model was trained for the target parameter of nighttime average amplitude of NPM-CHO path. The NARX model, which was built based on daily input variables of various physical parameters such as stratosphere temperature, cosmic rays and total column ozone, possessed good accuracies.\nAs a result, the constructed models are capable of performing accurate multistep ahead predictions, while maintaining acceptable one step ahead prediction accuracy. The results of the predicted daily VLF amplitude are in good agreement with observed (true) value for one step ahead prediction (r = 0.92, RMSE = 1.99), multi-step ahead 5 days prediction (r = 0.91, RMSE = 1.14) and multi-step ahead 10 days prediction (r = 0.75, RMSE = 1.74). The developed model indicates the feasibility and reliability of predicting lower ionospheric properties by the NARX neural network approach, and provides physical insights on the responses of lower ionosphere due to various external forcing.",

            "abstract": "We perform the new paleomagnetic data from intrusive complexes of two regions of Siberian Trap province (Angara – Taseeva depression and Tunguska syncline). Results of paleomagnetic and geological investigation indicate that two different patterns of magmatic process took place in these regions. In Angara – Taseeva depression short intense peaks of magmatic activity alternate with more prolonged periods of relative quietness. These bursts of magmatic activity resulted in intruding of large dolerite sills. In the central part of Tunguska syncline local intrusive events took place on the background of effusive volcanic activity.\nConsidering the new data together with previous paleomagnetic results from Norilsk and Maymecha - Kotuy regions (Pavlov et al., 2015), western part of Viluy basin (Konstantinov et al., 2014) and Angara-Taseeva depression (Latyshev et al., 2013), it can be concluded that pulsating character of magmatic activity is typical for the periphery of Tunguska syncline. However, the central part of Tunguska syncline is characterized by more prolonged and even style of volcanic process and less widescale intrusive events. This conclusion is important for understanding of LIPs formation and mantle plumes dynamics.\nThis study was funded by grants RFBR # 14-05-31447 and 15-35-20599 and Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (grant 14.Z50.31.0017).",

            "abstract": "The last ten years have seen several extreme climate events in southwestern Amazonia with historic impacts. The City of Rio Branco, Capital of Acre, Brazil´s westernmost State, suffered its seventh consecutive annual flooding and its worst in March 2015. The city of Tarauacá, also in Acre, registered 12 flooding events between November 2014 and April 2015. The most recent flood of the trinational Acre River in 2015 set historic records for flood stage and number of displaced persons in Cobija, the Capital of Pando, Bolivia. From February to April 2014, floods of the Madeira River disrupted the one highway between Acre and southern Brazil. Puerto Maldonado, the capital in Madre de Dios Region of Peru had its worst flood in 50 years during 2014. In 2005 and 2010, prolonged droughts combined with ignition sources resulted in tens to hundreds of thousands of hectares of fire-damaged rainforests in the Madre de Dios, Acre and Pando (MAP) Region. The Civil Defenses in these three contiguous political units faced several abrupt paradigm shifts that affected their responses: 1) The drought of 2005 showed dramatically that regional rainforests do burn; 2) The recent flooding history, particularly in 2012 and 2015, demolished the cultural icon of a nine-year recurrence interval; 3) What happens outside your territory can be devastating. The Madeira River flood impeded an estimated 200 million dollars from circulating in Acre; 4) The past can be a terrible guide. For Cobija and Rio Branco, the 2015 flood was on the order of a meter higher than any other. Many home dwellers did not evacuate in time because they used past floods as a guide; 5) A collapse in communication – cell phones, land lines, and Internet – can get worse. In 2012, such a collapse occurred in two border towns for 5 days, yet in 2015 it lasted more than 11 days. Research is needed to address how institutions linked to Civil Defense can shift paradigms in time to be more effective.",

            "abstract": "Urban tree canopy (UTC) coverage is a critical component of sustainable urban areas. Trees provide a number of important ecosystem services, including air pollution mitigation, water runoff control, and aesthetic and cultural values. Critically, urban trees also act to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect by shading impervious surfaces and via evaporative cooling. The cooling effect of urban trees can be seen locally, with individual trees reducing home HVAC costs, and at a citywide scale, reducing the extent and magnitude of an urban areas UHI. In order to accurately model the ecosystem services of a given urban forest, it is essential to map in detail the condition and composition of these trees at a fine scale, capturing individual tree crowns and their vertical structure. This paper presents methods for delineating UTC and measuring canopy structure at fine spatial resolution (<1m). These metrics are essential for modeling the HVAC benefits from UTC for individual homes, and for assessing the ecosystem services for entire urban areas. Such maps have previously been made using a variety of methods, typically relying on high resolution aerial or satellite imagery. This paper seeks to contribute to this growing body of methods, relying on a data fusion method to combine the information contained in high resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery and aerial lidar data using an object-based image classification approach. The study area, Worcester, MA, has recently undergone a large-scale tree removal and reforestation program, following a pest eradication effort. Therefore, the urban canopy in this location provides a wide mix of tree age class and functional type, ideal for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Early results show that the object-based classifier is indeed capable of identifying individual tree crowns, while continued research will focus on extracting crown structural characteristics using lidar-derived metrics. Ultimately, the resulting fine resolution UTC map will be compared with previously created UTC maps of the same area but for earlier dates, producing a canopy change map corresponding to the Worcester area tree removal and replanting effort.",

            "abstract": "The Pampa del Tamarugal is located in the Atacama Desert, the most arid desert of the world. It has important reserves of groundwater, which are probably fed by infiltration coming from the Andes Mountain, with groundwater levels fluctuating between 3 and 10-70 m below the land surface. In zones where shallow groundwater exists, the capillary rise allows to have a permanently moist vadose zone, which sustain native vegetation such as the Tamarugos (Prosopis tamarugo Phil.) and Algarrobos (Prosopis alba Griseb.). The native vegetation relies on the soil moisture and on the evaporative fluxes, which are controlled by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the soils.\nThe soils associated to the salt flats of the Pampa del Tamarugal are a mixture of sands and clays, which have high levels of sulfates, chloride, carbonates, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, with high pH and electrical conductivity, and low organic matter and cationic exchange capacity. In this research, we are interested in evaluating the impact of salinity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the soil, i.e., water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves.\nSoils were collected from the Pampa del Tamarugal and brought to the laboratory for characterization. The evaporation method (HYPROP, UMS) was used to determine the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve was estimated combining the evaporation method with direct measurements using a variable head permeameter (KSAT, UMS). It was found that higher sodium concentrations increase the water retention capacity and decrease the soil´s hydraulic conductivity. These changes occur in the moist range of the hydrodynamic characteristics. The soil’s hydraulic properties have significant impact on evaporation fluxes, which is the mayor component of the water balance. Thus, it is important to quantify them and incorporate salt precipitation/dissolution effect on the hydrodynamic properties to correctly simulate evaporation in saline soils.",

Although subsidence analysis is now a standard tool, paleoelevation estimation remains a challenging task, as estimates based on proxy data can be complicated by uncertainties in the relative controls of tectonics and climate. We therefore adopt an approach of combining established tools of subsidence analysis and detrital geochronology with emerging methods of volcanic glass paleoaltimetry, which enables us to explore a broad range of viable interpretations to understand the development of intermontane basins and their relationship to the development of the central Andean plateau. We investigated a suite of temporally overlapping and spatially separate Cenozoic basins spanning the east-west extent of the central Andean plateau in southern Peru. These basins contain an exceptional record of the vertical movements of this region. We calculate sediment accumulation and subsidence rates through decompaction of measured stratigraphic sections, and reconstruct past environmental conditions based on the stable isotopic composition of ancient waters preserved in hydrated volcanic glass. These data and published records of crustal shortening and exhumation show that although paleoaltimetry data in the study areas may be interpreted in various ways, they are best explained by multiple geodynamic processes driving (i) Eocene–early Miocene development of high topography in the Western Cordillera, then (ii) a pulsed middle Miocene–present building of the central Andean plateau from west to east, consistent with global climate changes as well as regional climate shifts driven by topographic development of the Andean orogen.",

The tomographic approach is an iteration method in which IPS observations are simulated in MHD steady-state solution, then differences between the simulated observation and the actual IPS observation is reduced by modifying solar-wind boundary map at 50 solar radii. This forward model needs to assume solar wind density and temperature as function of speed.\nWe use empirical functions, N(V) and T(V), derived from Helios in-situ measurement data within 0.5 AU in 1970s. For recent years, especially after 2006, these functions yield higher densities and lower temperatures than in-situ measurements indicate. To characterize the differences between the simulated and actual solar wind plasma, we tune parameters in the functions so that agreements with in-situ data (near the Earth and at Ulysses) will be optimized. This optimization approach can help better simulations of the solar corona and heliosphere, and will help our understandings on roles of magnetic field in solar wind heating and acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Overshooting Tops (OTs) are the clouds that penetrate into the tropopause and grow to the bottom of stratosphere at the top layer of cumulonimbus with very strong updraft. Severe weather conditions such as ground lightning, large hail, strong winds, and heavy rainfall can cause in the cumulonimbus clouds with OTs, with turbulence and lightning occurring very frequently in the area near OTs. In terms of aviation operations, OTs are a very important risk factor. According to Federal Aviation Administration, 509 cases of 4,326 weather-related events from 1992 to 2001were caused by turbulences. The detection of OTs is important to predict the degree and location of severe weather conditions such as turbulence, lightning, and thunderstorms. There are two methods widely used to detect OTs with multispectral images. One is the Water Vapor-InfraRed window channel Brightness Temperature Difference (WV-IRW BTD), which uses the differences in brightness temperatures at an infrared channel (about 11 ㎛). The other approach is the InfraRed Window texture (IRW-texture) method, which is based on the characteristics of OTs that appear a pixel group with low temperatures. The typical IRW-texture algorithm uses simple thresholds to detect OTs, whereas this research proposes an advanced approach based on machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM) with various variables from geostationary satellite data such as MSG SEVIRI (over Africa) and Himawari AHI (over East Asia) so as to improve the detection of OTs. OT and non-OT samples (e.g. other types of clouds such as stratus and cirrus) were extracted using the CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR) and SEVIRI (and Himawari) imagery. Results show that RF produced the best performance in detection of OTs yielding an overall accuracy of 98.33% and a false alarm rate of 9.01%. The user’s accuracies of OT and non-OT were similar, whereas the producer’s accuracy of non-OT was higher than that of OT. The results from the machine learning approaches were compared with those from the original IRW-texture algorithm (i.e., from GOES-R ATBD) as well as WV-IRW BTD (i.e., used for SEVIRI). Lightning data were also used for quantitative assessment of detected OTs over East Asia region.",

            "abstract": "Subducted, compositionally buoyant, crustal materials may form instabilities at the slab-mantle wedge interface which have the potential to feed crustal plumes that rise through the mantle wedge. The end result of this would be underplating of slab crustal material, below the over-riding plate, beneath arcs. This behaviour has been invoked to explain many features of arc magmatism, from variable sedimentary geochemical signatures to its discrete nature in space and time. It has also been proposed as a key mechanism that has led to the formation of Earth’s continental crust, at least in part, over time.\nWe set up a 2D, dynamic, numerical model of subduction with a compositionally layered subducting crust in order to investigate this process of crustal delamination and underplating. Upon undertaking a parameter sensitivity study of this model we recognise that subduction convergence rate has a particularly strong control on this behaviour with slow subduction zones favouring the formation of crustal instabilities. Therefore, we further quantify the effect of subduction velocity on the rate of crustal material flux into the mantle wedge and the composition of this delaminated material. A detailed literature study of observed arc magmatism throughout the Cenozoic, exhibits a correlation between convergence rate and certain geochemical signatures. Such signatures are often suggested to be linked with the melting of crustal materials in subduction zones. Here, we propose and illustrate that this correlation requires the operation of crustal delamination in slow subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic forcing impacts groundwater flows and contaminant fluxes in coastal aquifers. While numerous studies have quantified the influence of tides on coastal groundwater processes, wave effects are less understood. This is in part due to the difficultly in quantifying wave effects due to the temporal complexity of the forcing, i.e., irregular and higher frequency. This presentation provides an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the impact of waves on groundwater flows and contaminant fluxes along permeable shorelines. Although initial numerical efforts demonstrated the influence of steady wave conditions (i.e., constant wave height) on groundwater flows, salt-freshwater mixing and the fate of reactive constituents (nutrients) in the nearshore aquifer, waves are highly unsteady. More recent simulations and field data show that unsteady wave forcing, in particular episodic wave events, highly perturb nearshore groundwater flow patterns, salt-freshwater mixing conditions and contaminant residence times. Further, episodic wave events impact the salt-freshwater mixing zone and geochemical conditions in the nearshore aquifer for much longer periods than the time over which the higher waves occurred. While consideration of the phase-averaged effect of waves only (i.e., wave set up) has been shown to be adequate for evaluating the impact of waves on dissolved contaminants in coastal aquifers, recent data analysis suggests that phase-resolved instantaneous wave effects may strongly regulate the behaviour of particulate and colloidal constituents (i.e., particulate organic matter, microbial contaminants) close to the sediment-water interface.

            "abstract": "The understanding of the crustal structure of the northern North Sea was significantly improved with the acquisition of the deep seismic reflection profiles of the BIRPS project during the 1980’s. Some of those profiles have been interpreted by various authors, with interpretations that can differ considerably from each other.\nImprovement in the seismic imaging of recent surveys allows the observation of more structures at the crustal scale. The reflective lower crust is observed both in 2D and 3D surveys, but the reflection and nature of the top of the crystalline basement remains elusive in the seismic over extensive areas. The use of potential field data is key to constrain the basement interpretation.\nThe region has experienced multiple extensional events. Steeply dipping faults are correlated with the latest rifting episode in the northern North Sea (Middle Jurassic – Early Cretaceous), while other structures could be structures associated with the previous Permian-Triassic rifting or other pre-existing features.\nThe faults extend to different levels of the crust, with different detachment levels recognized also in previous works. In the recent seismic, the top of the reflective lower crust appears to be another important detachment level. The presence and geometry of faults that seem to cut the entire crust would rule out some of the previous models.",

            "abstract": "The strength of the creeping segment of the San Andres fault may be controlled by the distinct weakness and stability of talc (Moore & Rymer, 2007). We analyze talc frictional strength at high slip-velocity of 0.002 – 0.66 m/s, long slip-distances of 0.01 m to 33 m, and normal stresses up to 4.1 MPa. This analysis bridges the gap between nucleation stage of low velocity/distance, and the frictional behavior during large earthquakes. We tested wet and dry samples of pure talc gouge in a confined rotary cell, and continuously monitored the slip-velocity, stresses, dilation and temperature. We run 29 experiments of single and stepped velocities to obtain 243 values of quasi-static frictional coefficients.\nDry talc gouge showed distinct slip-strengthening: friction coefficient of µ ~0.4 at short slip-distances of D < 0.1 m, and it increased systematically to µ ~0.8 at slip-distances of D = 0.1- 1 m; at D > 1 m, the frictional strength saturated at µ= 0.8 – 1 level. Wet talc gouge (16-20% water) displayed low frictional strength of µ= 0.1-0.3, in agreement with published triaxial tests. The stepped-velocity runs revealed a consistent velocity-strengthening trend. For a velocity jump from V1 to V2, we used VD = (µ2 –µ1)/ln (V2/V1), and found that on average VD = 0.06 and 0.03 for dry and wet talc, respectively, and for slip distances shorter than 1 m.\nMicrostructural analysis of post-shearing wet talc gouge revealed extreme slip localization to a principal-slip-zone of a few microns, and significant shear compaction of 10-30%. In contrast, dry talc gouge exhibited distributed shear in a wide zone and systematic shear dilation (10-50%). We propose slip along weak interlayer talc plates and thermal-pressurization as the possible weakening mechanisms for wet talc. The development of distributed secondary fault network along with substantial grain crushing is responsible for slip-strengthening in dry condition.\nFig. 1.

            "abstract": "Marine ice sheet models should be capable of handling complex feedbacks between ice and ocean, such as marine ice sheet instability, and the atmosphere, such as the elevation-mass balance feedback, operating at different time scales. Recent model intercomparisons (e.g., SeaRISE, MISMIP) have shown that the complexity of many ice sheet models is focused on processes that are either not well captured numerically (spatial resolution issue) or are of secondary importance compared to the essential features of marine ice sheet dynamics. Here, we propose a new and fast computing ice sheet model, devoid of most complexity, but capturing the essential feedbacks when coupled to ocean or atmospheric models. Its computational efficiency guarantees to easily tests its advantages as well as limits through ensemble modelling.\nThe fETISh (fast Elementary Thermomechanical (marine) Ice Sheet) model is a vertically integrated hybrid (SSA/SIA) ice sheet model. Although vertically integrated, thermomechanical coupling is ensured through a simplified representation of ice sheet thermodynamics based on an analytical solution of the vertical temperature profile, including strain heating and horizontal advection. The marine boundary is represented by a flux condition similar to Pollard & Deconto (2012), based on Schoof (2007). Buttressing of ice shelves is taken into account via the Shallow-Shelf Approximation (SSA). The ice sheet model is solved on four staggered finite difference grids for numerical efficiency/stability. Numerical tests following EISMINT, ISMIP and MISMIP are performed as a prerequisite.\nThe fETISh model is forced with different ice-shelf melt rates and basal sliding perturbations to allow comparison with recent model intercomparisons of the Antarctic ice sheet (e.g., SeaRISE, Favier et al. (2013)). These forcings are further completed with a set of scenarios involving ice-shelf buttressing and unbuttressing. All experiments are carried out on different spatial resolutions of the BEDMAP2 datasets, leading to an ensemble of dynamic Antarctic mass change over time scales ranging from 100-500 years, according to the scenarios presented. Analysis of the ensemble compared to previous ensemble experiments (e.g. SeaRISE) shows that uncertainties due to model setup/specifications can be greatly reduced.",

Recent studies confirm that benthic N2 fixation can be coupled to sulfate reduction (SR) and that several species of sulfate reducing bacteria have the genetic ability to fix N due to the presence of the gene encoding for the nitrogenase enzyme.\nWe investigated benthic N2 fixation and SR in the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone at 12°S and in the Mauritanian upwelling system at 18°N along a depth transect. Sediments were retrieved by a multicorer and a benthic lander at six stations in both regions.\nBenthic N2 fixation occurred throughout the sediment in both EBUS. Off Peru the highest integrated (0-20 cm) N2 fixation rate of 0.4 mmol N/m2/d was measured inside the core of the OMZ at 253 m water depth. Off Mauritania the highest integrated (0-20 cm) N2 fixation rate of 0.15 mmol N/m2/d was measured at 90 m, coinciding with a low bottom water oxygen concentration (30 µM). N2 fixation depth profiles often overlapped with SR activity. Moreover, sequencing data yielded insights into the composition and diversity of the nifH gene pool in EBUS sediments. Interestingly, detected sequences in both EBUS clustered with SR bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio vulgaris and several of the novel detected clades belonged to uncultured diazotrophs.\nOur results suggest that N2 fixation and SR were coupled to a large extent in both regions. However, potential environmental factors controlling benthic diazotrophs in the EBUS appear to be the availability of sulfide and organic matter. Additionally, no inhibition of N2 fixation at high ammonium concentrations was found, which highlights gaps in our knowledge regards the interaction between ammonium availability and diazotrophy. Our results contribute to a better understanding of N cycling in EBUS sediments and sources of fixed N.",

While necessary to life, excess Nr can be detrimental to ecosystem and human health, causing impacts such as smog, eutrophication, biodiversity loss, and climate change. The NF tool was recently developed to help institutions measure and reduce their environmental impact. This tool accounts for the NF from energy usage, food production and consumption, fertilizer usage, research animals, and agricultural activities. The tool also provides scenario analysis to help institutions reduce their NF and establish a reduction target. Currently in a testing phase, seven institutions have used the tool to calculate their NF, and six additional institutions have calculations in progress.\nMany institutions interested in sustainability have already calculated their carbon footprint (CF), which reports the total greenhouse gas emissions resulting from institution activities. The University of New Hampshire Sustainability Institute (UNHSI) Campus Carbon Calculator, developed in 2001, is used by thousands of institutions in the United States. While important, the CF addresses just one aspect of an institution’s environmental impact: global climate change. The NF broadens this perspective by connecting to additional environmental impacts that are both global and local. The data requirements for the CF and NF have a significant overlap, especially in the energy sector. Given the similarity of data requirements and the benefits of considering the two footprints together, the two tools are in the preliminary stages of being merged.\nWe will first provide an overview of the NF tool for institutions. We will then compare available NF and CF results from multiple institutions to assess trends and correlations and to determine the impact of different scenarios on both footprints.",

            "abstract": "Methane flux from wetlands is both a critical component of the global CH4 budget, and highly sensitive to global climate change. Gaps in our knowledge of the biological processes that underlie CH4 fluxes from natural ecosystems limit our ability to scale flux estimates as well as predict future emissions. To address these gaps, we used quantum cascade laser technology linked to automated chambers to quantify the isotopic composition of CH4 fluxes from a high latitude (68° N) wetland underlain by discontinuous permafrost (Stordalen Mire, Sweden) and a temperate wetland (43° N) undergoing shrub encroachment (Sallie’s Fen, NH). Changes in plant communities and hydrology during permafrost thaw result in both large increases in CH4 emissions as well as shifts in the CH4 production pathway, from hydrogenotrophic to increasingly acetoclastic mechanisms. In contrast, shrub encroachment that replaces sedge species in the temperate wetland reduces CH4 emissions, but doesn’t effect δ 13C-CH4, with predominantly acetoclastic production occurring across plant communities. Multi-year data sets identify temperature and hydrologic variability as key contributors to annual and interannual patterns in δ 13C-CH4. Fully-thawed fens at Stordalen had consistent δ13C-CH4 across years, with an annual pattern suggestive of more hydrogenotrophic production early and late in the growing season. In contrast, intermediate-thaw sites, where the water table was more dynamic, had large variations in δ13C-CH4 across years. At Sallie’s Fen, patterns in δ13C-CH4 suggest an abrupt shift in CH4 transport and metabolism at the beginning of the growing season and then more stable δ13C-CH4 during the growing season. Together these results provide insights into how plant communities and variable environmental conditions interact to influence the microbial metabolisms that drive CH4 production and consumption in diverse wetland ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations by increasing the terrestrial carbon sink is one possible option to reduce man made climate change. Terrestrial CO2 uptake can be increased by large scale afforestation as projected in the RCP4.5 scenario. In addition, future CO2 fertilization will lead to an enhanced CO2 uptake by plants. The strength of the terrestrial CO2 sink depends on both the uptake of CO2 by plants and the release of CO2 during soil respiration. Both factors are influenced by climatic conditions and availability of nutrients such as nitrogen. Availability of nitrogen in the soil depends on the amount of nitrogen released during mineralization and the amount of nitrogen lost e.g. through leaching or gaseous emissions. As those processes are sensitive to climatic conditions, availability if nitrogen will be affected by future climate change. This study examines the effect of nitrogen availability on the terrestrial CO2 sink under future climate and the RCP land use by applying the land component of the MPI Earth system model. A combination of different land use and climate forcings allows for a quantification of important factors influencing the interactions between climate, nitrogen and land use.",

            "abstract": "Model parameters are a source of uncertainty that can easily cause systematic deviation and significantly affect the accuracy of soil moisture generation in assimilation systems. This study addresses the issue of retrieving model parameters related to soil moisture via the simultaneous estimation of states and parameters based on the Common Land Model (CoLM). The state-parameter estimation algorithms AEnKF (Augmented Ensemble Kalman Filter)，DEnKF (Dual Ensemble Kalman Filter) and SODA (Simultaneous optimization and data assimilation) are entirely implemented within an EnKF framework to investigate how the three algorithms can correct model parameters and improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimation. The analysis is illustrated by assimilating the surface soil moisture levels from varying observation intervals using data from Mongolian plateau sites. Furthermore, a radiation transfer model is introduced as an observation operator to analyze the influence of brightness temperature assimilation on states and parameters that are estimated at different microwave signal frequencies. Three cases were analyzed for both soil moisture and brightness temperature assimilation, focusing on the progressive incorporation of parameter uncertainty, forcing data uncertainty and model uncertainty. It has been demonstrated that EnKF is outperformed by all other methods, as it consistently maintains a bias. State-parameter estimation algorithms can provide a more accurate estimation of soil moisture than EnKF. AEnKF is the most robust method, with the lowest RMSE values for retrieving states and parameters dealing only with parameter uncertainty, but it possesses disadvantages related to increasing sources of uncertainty and decreasing numbers of observations. SODA performs well under the complex situations in which DEnKF shows slight disadvantages in terms of statistical indicators; however, the former consumes far more memory and time than the latter.",

            "abstract": "One of the leading problems in our understanding of Jupiter's atmosphere, known colloquially as the 'energy crisis', is that the upper atmosphere has global temperatures far in excess of that predicted by solar heating. Unlike the Earth, solar heating has only a small effect on the thermosphere, varying little in temperature with local time, and with equatorial neutrals co-rotating with the planet due to meridional advection. Within the auroral region, ionosphere-thermosphere coupling produces strong flows and results in huge Joule Heating from auroral currents. In this region, the temperature excess can be explained, but Jupiter's fast rotation means that Coriolis forces prevent energy in the poles from transferring equatorward, so there remains no explanation of why low latitudes are overheated by a factor of 3-5 over that predicted by solar heating alone.\nDespite this anomaly, although the past twenty years has seen a wealth of new data and results in Jupiter's auroral region, studies of the equatorial region have been somewhat limited. This lack of investigation comes partly from the apparent uniform nature of the equatorial region, and partly from the difficulty in observing this region. It is only in the past three years that observers begun to re-examine this region, revealing evidence of complex interactions between the thermosphere and ionosphere, including what appears to be thermospheric weather patterns at a fixed planetary longitudes, stable over two decades; perhaps caused by continuous flows from the auroral region.\nHere, we introduce our recent research, in order to compare and contrast what has been observed at Jupiter with the more well understood interactions between Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. We hope that this will open a discussion between the communities that will improve our understanding of the underlying physical processes, as they occur at both planets.",

            "abstract": "Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information. In sonification, several elements can be altered, modified or manipulated to change the perception of the sound, and in turn, the perception of the information being transmitted. For example, an increase or decrease in pitch, tempo and amplitude can be used to convey the information but this can also happen by varying other less commonly used components. One of the advantages of using sonification lies in the temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution that offer complementary and supplementary possibilities with respect to visualization techniques. Two years ago, the outcomes of the PolarSEEDS project (\nwww.polaseeds.org\n), consisting of sonification of time series of albedo, melting and surface temperature over the Greenland ice sheet, were presented in this very same session. The work that I will discuss in this presentation builds on the PolarSEEDS experience, focusing on the fascinating microcosm of cryoconite. Cryoconite is a unique and extremely fascinating form of glacial cover consisting of aggregated rock dust, inorganic and detrital organic matter, and active microbial colonies. It can be seen as ‘living stones’, with this ecosystem containing the only form of life that is sustained on the majestic surface of the Greenland ice sheet. Microbes are, indeed, the catalyst for cryoconite formation and growth. The cryoconite constituents radiate metabolic heat promoting glacier hole development, melt water formation, and decreasing glacier surface albedo. Lower albedos cause a positive feedback that further contributes to glacier ablation. Despite their importance, cryoconite systems are poorly studied and little is known about their evolution.\nIn the talk, I will first present and discuss previous sonification projects whose main focus was on the polar regions; then, I will present new sonifications based on data quantifying the distribution and evolution of cryoconite over the west portion of the Greenland ice sheet. Such dataset includes high-resolution digital photography collected from a helicopter-mounted camera in July 2015. The images have an unprecedented spatial resolution of 6 cm, producing a wide spectrum of information that is translated into sounds and ‘sonified’ through an ad-hoc developed code.",

            "abstract": "Characterising earthquake sources rapidly and robustly is an essential component of any earthquake early warning (EEW) procedure. Ideally, this characterisation should:\n(i) be probabilistic -- enabling appreciation of the full range of mechanisms compatible with available data, and taking observational and theoretical uncertainties into account; and\n(ii) operate in a physically-complete theoretical framework.\nHowever, implementing either of these ideals increases computational costs significantly, making it unfeasible to satisfy both in the short timescales necessary for EEW applications.\nThe barrier here arises from the fact that conventional probabilistic inversion techniques involve running many thousands of forward simulations after data has been obtained---a procedure known as `posterior sampling'. Thus, for EEW, all computational costs must be incurred after the event time. Here, we demonstrate a new approach---based instead on `prior sampling'---which circumvents this problem and is feasible for EEW applications. All forward simulations are conducted in advance, and a learning algorithm is used to assimilate information about the relationship between model and data. Once observations from an earthquake become available, this information can be used to infer probability density functions (pdfs) for seismic source parameters, within milliseconds.\nWe demonstrate this procedure using data from the 2008 Mw5.4 Chino Hills earthquake. We compute Green’s functions for 150 randomly-chosen locations on the Whittier and Chino faults, using SPECFEM3D and a 3D model of the regional velocity structure. We then use these to train neural networks that map from seismic waveforms to pdfs on a point-source, moment-tensor representation of the event mechanism. We show that using local network data from the Chino Hills event, this system provides accurate information on magnitude, epicentral location and source half-duration using data available 6 seconds after the first station triggers; if longer windows are used, constraints on focal mechanism can also be obtained. We demonstrate that the use of 3D wave propagation allows results to be constrained better than is possible when only 1D earth models are used.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that presently there are over half a million brownfields in the United States, but this number only includes sites for which an Environmental Site Assessment has been conducted. The actual number of brownfields is certainly in the millions and constitutes one of the major environmental issues confronting all communities today. Taught in part or entirely online for more than 15 years in environmental science, engineering, and hydrology courses at over a dozen colleges, universities, and high schools in the United States, Brownfield Action (BA) is an interactive, web-based simulation that combines scientific expertise, constructivist education philosophy, and multimedia to advance the teaching of environmental science (Bower et al., 2011, 2014; Liddicoat and Bower, 2015). In the online simulation and classroom, students form geotechnical consulting companies with a peer chosen at random to solve a problem in environmental forensics. The BA model contains interdisciplinary scientific and social information that are integrated within a digital learning environment that encourages students to construct their knowledge as they learn by doing. As such, the approach improves the depth and coherence of students understanding of the course material. Like real-world environmental consultants and professionals, students are required to develop and apply expertise from a wide range of fields, including environmental science and engineering as well as journalism, medicine, public health, law, civics, economics, and business management. The overall objective is for students to gain an unprecedented appreciation of the complexity, ambiguity, and risk involved in any environmental issue, and to acquire STEM knowledge that can be used constructively when confronted with such an issue.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost affects about 24% of the Northern Hemisphere land surface. Organic carbon storage in soils and deep deposits in these regions exceeds 1000 Pg and has resulted in a long-term carbon sink to the atmosphere. A large portion of this carbon is perennially frozen and radiocarbon dates ranging from Holocene to Late Pleistocene ages indicate it has been removed from active cycling for thousands of years. In a warming Arctic, understanding how short-term processes and their feedbacks with climate might interfere with long-term permafrost soil carbon storage is of crucial importance to projecting future trajectories of climate. For example, complex landscape and biogeochemical dynamics in northern wetlands and lake-rich regions may lead to decomposition of soil organic carbon under anaerobic conditions and significant methane release to the atmosphere.\nHere we focus on the role of lakes in permafrost regions for the mobilization of old organic carbon from permafrost deposits in the form of methane. Lake cover is especially extensive (up to 40% limnicity) in northern permafrost lowlands associated with thick ice- and organic-rich deposits. A large portion of these lakes are thermokarst lakes that rapidly thaw underlying and surrounding permafrost soils, providing organic-rich anaerobic environments for methane production in thaw bulbs and lake sediments. However, various other types of lakes exist and multiple drivers affect how and at what rates various lake types may interact with permafrost and soil organic carbon. We discuss new broad-scale remote sensing, spatial data analysis, and modeling approaches that allow an assessment of the methane emission potentials of northern high latitude lakes in relation to permafrost and surface deposits.",

            "abstract": "Both Earth and Mars experience ionospheric outflow, but the radically different magnetic field configurations at the two planets yield significantly different patterns of outflow and processes governing outflow. This study examines a set of numerical simulations for Earth and Mars to explore the factors controlling ionospheric outflow and the fate of the escaping ions (immediate precipitation, magnetospheric recirculation, or loss to deep space). Specifically, simulation results from the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), which is capable of handling both planetary space environments, are analyzed to assess the physical processes governing the fate of ionospheric ions. Velocity streamlines from the SWMF results are traced from the high-latitude inner boundary of the BATS-R-US MHD simulation domain and followed through geospace. Some of these streamlines return to the inner boundary of the simulation domain, others extend to the outer boundary of the domain, while most others eventually cross (or at least approach) the magnetospheric equatorial plane. At Earth, this plane is well defined, while at Mars there are multiple mini-magnetospheres in which ionospheric ions can become trapped. These streamlines are categorized according to their eventual destination. Multi-fluid MHD simulations are examined in this study, assessing the influence of species mass on trajectories through near-planet space. Steady-state numerical experiments with different levels of solar driving are examined to quantify the influence of each driver on outflow characteristics and the fate of outflowing ions. Real event intervals are considered to assess flows in a time-varying magnetospheric system. For Earth, as solar wind dynamic pressure increases, the dominant outflow region moves to lower latitudes and significantly more of the outflowing ions escape to deep space. As the interplanetary magnetic field increases in southward magnitude, the region of dominant outflow shifts to lower latitudes and more is injected into the inner magnetosphere. The ionospheric regions dominantly contributing to mass within the magnetosphere are assessed and compared for the different driving conditions. At Mars, the situation is much more complicated.",

To start with, there were the federal agencies that made GSS possible: WESTGEC, NIGEC, NSF, and NASA. An NSF grant enabled the project to have teachers field test GSS in their classes and meet in summer institutes that resulted in GSS module dealing with climate change and related topics including energy use, ozone, loss of biodiversity, and ecosystem change. Interacting small and large systems naturally became an overarching theme. NASA grants and relationships with other NASA grantees in the NASA Innovations in Climate Education (NICE) program resulted in formation of Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) in the GSS Lifelines for High School Climate Change Education project. Teachers involved in that project participated in webinars with representatives of various climate change education resources, including SatCam, Detroit Climate Action Collaborative, Picture Post (UNH), Eyes on Earth, Earth Exploration Toolbook, My NASA Data, Digital Earth Watch (DEW), Alliance for Climate Education (ACE), the JPL Global Climate Change website, EOS-Webster (UNH), and Museum of the Earth at the Paleontological Research Institution. These webinars were recorded and are available at http://www.globalsystemsscience.org/lifelines/presentations.

            "abstract": "In France the low levels of forest harvest (40 Mm3 per year over a volume increment of 89Mm3) is frequently cited to push for a more intensive management of the forest that would help reducing CO2 emissions. This reasoning overlooks the medium-to-long-term effects on the carbon uptake at the national scale that result from changes in the forest’s structure and delayed emissions from products decay and bioenergy burning, both determinant for the overall C fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere.\nTo address the impacts of an increase in harvest removal on biosphere-atmosphere carbon fluxes at national scale, we build a consistent regional modeling framework to integrate the forest-carbon system from photosynthesis to wood uses. We aim at bridging the gap between regional ecosystem modeling and land managers’ considerations, to assess the synergistic and antagonistic effects of management strategies over C-based forest services: C-sequestration, energy and material provision, fossil fuel substitution.\nFor this, we built on inventory data to develop a spatial forest growth simulator and design a novel method for diagnosing the current level of management based on stand characteristics (density, quadratic mean diameter or exploitability). The growth and harvest simulated are then processed with a life cycle analysis to account for wood transformation and uses. Three scenarii describe increases in biomass removals either driven by energy production target (set based on national prospective with a lock on minimum harvest diameters) or by changes in management practices (shorter or longer rotations, management of currently unmanaged forests) to be compared with business as usual simulations.\nOur management levels' diagnostics quantifies undermanagement at national scale and evidences the large weight of ownership-based undermanagement with an average of 26% of the national forest (between 10% and 40% per species) and thus represents a huge potential wood resource. We examine the effects of a mobilization of this resource versus an intensification of the current harvest on the age structure, the productivity and the stocking volume of the French forest and derive the related impacts on C emissions and C-related services provided by forests.",

            "abstract": "A geochronological study the Andaman ophiolite was performed along a ~120 km corridor on the eastern margin of the Andaman Islands, which forms part of the Andaman-Nicobar accretionary wedge. This Cretaceous ophiolite sequence occurs as imbricate thrust wedges overlying the Paleogene flysch and Neogene pelagic sediments. Incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar dating of three pillow basalts and a peridotite samples reveals that the ophiolite has a composite thermal history. Apparent age spectra of all the samples suggest a clear two stage evolution, with the high temperature steps (1000 to 1400oC) and the lower temperature steps (400-950oC) showing a staircase pattern and a plateau-like pattern, respectively. The apparent ages of the highest temperature steps vary from 135 Ma to 97 Ma, which appear to suggest multiple crystallization ages. Interestingly, the plateau-like spectra for the lower temperature steps yield indistinguishable ages, although with very high errors (as high as 67% at 1s), across all the samples. The isochron ages too overlap with the plateau-like ages. Thus the weighted average of the plateau-like ages of 0.9±0.3 (2s) Ma most likely represents the timing of the latest thermal resetting. Based on the above information we conclude that while different units of the Andaman ophiolite may have been formed at different times, all had seen a major thermal resetting. Considering the position of these rocks vis-à-vis the structural configuration of the Andaman-Nicobar accretionary wedge we infer that there was a mega thrusting event in the region at ~0.9 Ma which was possibly responsible for exhumation of the current outcrops of the ophiolite sequence along the east coast of the Andman Islands.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s radiation budget is a fundamental component of the climate system and should reflect the variation in climate. As such, it is critical to know how it has varied over past decades to ensure that climate models are properly representing climate. Broadband shortwave and longwave irradiances were measured by the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) wide-field-of-view (WFOV) nonscanner instrument from 1985 to 1998. These WFOV nonscanner instruments were onboard NASA’s Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two NOAA’s satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10). However, earlier studies showed that the transmissivity of the dome for the WFOV shortwave (SW) nonscanner instrument degraded over time. To account for the degradation, WFOV instruments were calibrated assuming constant spectral degradation (gray assumption). Recent developments from analysis of data from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System project (CERES), which has been measuring the radiation budget since 2000, suggest that transmissivity of shorter wavelength degrades faster. Therefore, a spectrally dependent degradation correction is needed for a better calibration. In addition, accounting for the spectrally dependent degradation may eliminate an additional correction applied to irradiances using a time series of daytime and nighttime longwave irradiance differences. Therefore, we have reprocessed WFOV nonscanner data by characterizing the spectrally dependent degradation of the SW dome transmissivity. Time and spectral dependent degradation of the shortwave filter function is estimated using solar data observed by these instruments during calibration days. Because the spectrum of reflected irradiance depends on scene type, we use Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR-derived cloud properties and surface type over the WFOV footprints in addition to time dependent filter function for the unfiltering process. This poster explains the reprocessing approach and discusses the results by comparing the existing ERBE radiation dataset to that obtained with reprocessing using the new correction. This leads to the generation of a long-term radiation datasets consistent with those provided by CERES.",

Trying to determine why some clouds precipitated while others did not, Langmuir concluded that non-precipitating clouds were lacking “ice nuclei” that would gather up cloud droplets until they became large enough to fall out of the cloud. If they could find an artificial substitute, it would be possible to modify clouds and the weather. Dry ice particles did the trick, military funding followed, and cloud busting commenced. But a handful of entrepreneurial meteorologists saw a different purpose: enhancing precipitation and preventing hail damage. The commercialization of weather modification was underway, with cloud seeding enhancing rainfall east of the Cascades, in the Desert Southwest, and even in the watersheds serving New York City. Hail busting took off in the Dakotas, and snowpack enhancement got a boost in Montana. Basic cloud physics research very quickly became commercial weather modification, fulfilling a postwar desire to use science and technology to control nature and creating an opening for meteorologists to provide a variety of specialized services to businesses whose profits depend on the weather.",

Fibre optics Distributed Temperature Sensors (DTS) allow for precise temperature measurement along optical cables of up to several kilometres, sampling at resolutions of up to few centimetres in space and seconds in time. The optical cable is the sensor and can be buried in the soil with minimum disturbance, to construct soil temperature profiles, over large surveying areas.\nSoil moisture can be obtained from the analysis of both heating and cooling rates measured by the DTS, when copper conductors embedded in the optical cable are electrically heated (technique known as Active DTS). In July 2015, three loops of optical cable of 500m each have been buried in the soil at different depths (0.05m, 0.25m and 0.40m), along an inclined recently vegetated field in the Birmingham area, UK. Active DTS tests have been set with the aim to characterize the soil temperature and moisture regimes of the field at high spatial resolution, in response to both sporadic events such as showers or scheduled irrigation, and diurnal fluctuations induced by atmospheric forcing.\nSpatiotemporal variations of the aforementioned regimes will be used to trace vertical and horizontal soil heat and water movements.\nFinally, assumptions on the possibility to correlate soil heat and water dynamics to a specific process such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil inclination, will be discussed. This research is part of the Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) INTERFACES project and is realised in the context of the Free Air Carbon Enrichment (FACE) experiment, in collaboration with the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR).",

            "abstract": "The surfaces of many objects in the Solar System comprise substantial quantities of water ice either in pure form or mixed with minerals and/or organic molecules. Sublimation is a process responsible for shaping and changing the reflectance properties of these objects.\nWe present laboratory data on the evolution of the structure and the visible and near-infrared spectral reflectance of icy surfaces made of mixtures of water ice and non-volatile components (complex organic matter and silicates), as they undergo sublimation of the water ice under low temperature and pressure conditions (Poch et al., under review). We prepared icy surfaces which are potential analogues of ices found on comets, icy satellites or trans-neptunian objects (TNOs). The experiments were carried out in the SCITEAS simulation setup recently built as part of the Laboratory for Outflow Studies of Sublimating Materials (LOSSy) at the University of Bern (Pommerol et al., 2015a).\nAs the water ice sublimated, we observed in situ the formation of a sublimation lag deposit, or sublimation mantle, made of the non-volatiles at the top of the samples. The texture (porosity, internal cohesiveness etc.), the activity (outbursts and ejection of mantle fragments) and the spectro-photometric properties of this mantle are found to differ strongly depending on the chemical nature of the non-volatiles, the size of their particles, the way they are mixed with the volatile component and the dust/ice mass ratio. The results also indicate how the band depths of the sub-surface water ice evolve during the build-up of the sublimation mantle.\nThese data provide useful references for interpreting remote-sensing observations of Rosetta (see Pommerol et al., 2015b), and also New Horizons.\nPoch, O., et al., under review in Icarus\nPommerol, A., et al., 2015a, Planet.

            "abstract": "Glacial erosion can have an impact on the location and development of faults in mountain belts. The rapid removal and deposition of rock, in some cases, is thought to affect the initiation of slip on older fault structures, or cause the development of new structures within the older part of the wedge. We present cross-sectional data from both erosional and non-erosional sandbox models of Coulomb wedges in order to quantify the impact of localized erosion on the location of and slip on deformational structures, as well as the general path of material through a wedge. To do this, we employ Lagrangian particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) using the open-source Python PTV toolkit trackpy, among a suite of other data analysis tools. We are able to extract robust and reliable sets of particle trajectories from a series of images without the need for predefined markers or marker-beds, instead identifying and tracking natural variations in sand color as individual particles. By comparing the motion of particles in cross-section to the local surface topography over an entire experiment, we determine a high-resolution record of exhumation rates, in addition to simple uplift rates. These comparisons are further informed by the use of high-definition Eulerian particle image velocimetry (PIV), which provides quantitative data about the distribution of deformation and instantaneous material displacements throughout a cross-sectional view of a Coulomb wedge. This allows us to interpret these pathways in relation to the behavior of active structures and general wedge morphology. In our experiments, we observe that localized glacial erosion has an impact on material pathways, in the form of an increased rate of exhumation locally, more vertical trajectories towards surface below the zone of erosion, and reactivation of older structures to maintain force balance within the entire wedge.",

            "abstract": "The repeated occurrence of exceptional floods within a few years, such as the Rhine floods in 1993 and 1995 and the Elbe and Danube floods in 2002 and 2013, suggests that floods in Central Europe are temporally organized in flood-rich and flood-poor periods. This suggestion is studied by testing the significance of temporal clustering in flood occurrence for 67 catchments across Germany. To assess the robustness of the results, different methods are used: Firstly, the index of dispersion which quantifies the degree of temporal clustering and the departure from a homogeneous Poisson process is investigated. Further, the flood occurrence rate is derived by nonparametric kernel implementation. For the latter, the significance of clustering is evaluated via parametric and nonparametric tests. To understand whether clustering changes with flood severity and time scale, the significance is assessed for different thresholds and time scales, from the intra-annual to the decadal time scale. It is found that the large majority of catchments show temporal clustering at the 5 % significance level for low thresholds and intra-annual to inter-annual time scales. However, the relevance of clustering decreases substantially with increasing threshold and time scale. These results suggest that flood clustering is mainly caused by catchment memory effects and that decadal climate variability plays a minor role in Germany. Although the methods give consistent overall results, i.e. decreasing clustering with increasing severity and time scale, the specific results differ considerably. Hence, it is advisable to apply different methods when investigating flood clustering.",

Recently more attention has been paid to three-dimensional flow features and sediment transport characteristics, but this has been done in a compartmentalised way, with studies either focusing on one or the other aspect. In this study, we present for the first time a three-dimensional analysis of sediment transport processes as an indication of self-maintenance mechanisms due to erosion and aggradation in pools and riffles. We do that by first reconstructing from experimental data the 3-D flow patterns in a typical pool-riffle sequence and computing bed shear stress distribution and near-bed streamlines for low and high flow conditions. We then use these 3-D features to complement a one-year dataset from an unsteady fractional sediment transport and bed evolution model applied to an existing stream. Local instantaneous bedload transport is obtained using the bed shear stress distribution corresponding to the flow condition (low or high) and assumed to follow the streamlines for that flow condition (low or high). Streamlines laterally contract and expand on pools and riffles, respectively, but in a different way during low and high flow condition. We apply the streamtube concept to compute instantaneous local rates of sediment transport in pools and contiguous downstream riffles and compute reversal conditions and identify self-maintenance episodes. Comparison with reversal episodes identified using cross- sectional average values reveal that when considering the 3-D effects stronger reversal episodes were detected, but the actual number of episodes increased only slightly (8%). Most reversal episodes occurred in the streamtubes that originated near the centre of the pool. Results support the idea that local flow can produce near-bed self-maintenance conditions even in conditions which average flow could not, but only to a certain extent.",

            "abstract": "We examined relationship between ice microphysics and super-saturation by the synergy use of CloudSat cloud radar and CALIPSO lidar and infrared sounder AIRS on Aqua. The retrieval algorithm of ice microphysics was based on Okamoto et al., (2010) but the following improvement was implemented. Ice non-sphericity, orientation and laser pointing angle were considered to estimate scattering properties needed in the analysis of CloudSat and CALIPSO lidar data by the physical optics approximation (Borovoi et al., 2012) and the discrete dipole approximation (Okamoto 2002). Different look up tables were applied for the period of laser-pointing angle of 0.3 degrees off-nadir direction and for the one of 3 degrees off-nadir. Super-saturation was retrieved using 110 temperature and 46 humidity channels of AIRS (Ishimoto 2009 and Ishimoto et al., 2014). The algorithm relied on channel ranking approach to detect clouds by the AIRS information alone so that microwave sounder information was not needed contrary to the AIRS standard product. This achieved three times higher spatial resolution (13.5km) compared with the AIRS standard product so that it is suitable to study super-saturation. We analyzed ice microphysics and super-saturation in the vicinity of the ice clouds to analyze the relation between ice microphysics and super-saturation. AIRS showed relative humidity can reach 160% but majority was below 130%. Super-saturation generally occurred in correspondence with ice clouds. Concept of equivalent ice water content (IWCeq) was introduced as difference between water vapor density and saturation water vapor density. IWCeq was generally larger than IWC. Geophysical patterns between IWCeq and IWC were in good agreement in mid- and high-levels. Global analysis showed IWC increased as IWCeq increased. It was found such relation did not depend on latitudes. Ice formation seemed to occur at about 5 to 10% below relative humidity.",

            "abstract": "Cold-water coral (CWC) reefs are formed by framework building scleratinians Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata that baffle sediment and over time, have the potential to develop into large coral mounds of up to 300m high (e.g. Belgica Mound Province). The detailed mechanisms of initiation and build-up of such large CWC mounds are however not yet fully understood. It is therefore essential to study smaller mounds (often termed “mini-mounds”) that can be interpreted as earlier growth stages that haven’t had the time to coalesce and develop into larger mounds. The FWO Minimound project (2013-2017) aims to investigate CWC mini-mounds within the Bay of Biscay (European Margin) in order to determine the impact of: (1) palaeoceanographic changes related to glacial-interglacial climate change in the last 15 ka, (2) hydrocarbon seepage processes and (3) anthropogenic fishing activities on CWC habitats. The project targets three minimound provinces: the Ferrol Canyon (Cantabrian Margin), the Guilvinec Canyon (Armorican Margin) and the Explorer and Dangeard Canyons (Celtic Margin). These mini-mounds are fossil and occur at relative shallow depths on the interface between the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) and the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW). Contrastingly, most living CWC reefs in this region of the Atlantic, dwell in the deeper MOW depth range, relying on the density and dynamics of this water mass for their food supply. In order to investigate the initiation, growth and demise of CWC mini-mounds, 35m of USBL guided sediment cores were retrieved from the Explorer and Dangeard Interfluves. We present data of sedimentological, geochemical and palaeoceanographic analyses throughout the cores, coupled with high-resolution geophysical data. Preliminary results indicate that the mound base is associated with a strong shift in sedimentation regime potentially linked to climate driven palaeoceanographic changes of the MOW-ENACW interface.",

            "abstract": "The coastal zone, including its bathymetry, topography, ecosystem, and communities, depends on and responds to a wide array of natural and engineered processes associated with climate variability. Climate affects the frequency of coastal storms, which are only resolved probabilistically for future conditions, as well as setting the pace for persistent processes (e.g., waves driving daily alongshore transport; beach nourishment). It is not clear whether persistent processes or extreme events contribute most to the integrated evolution of the coast. Yet, observations of coastal change record the integration of persistent and extreme processes. When these observations span a large spatial domain and/or temporal range they may reflect a wide range of forcing and boundary conditions that include different levels of sea-level rise, storminess, sediment input, engineering activities, and elevation distributions. We have been using a statistical approach to characterize the interrelationships between oceanographic, ecological, and geomorphic processes—including the role played by human activities via coastal protection, beach nourishment, and other forms of coastal management.\n The statistical approach, Bayesian networks, incorporates existing information to establish underlying prior expectations for the distributions and inter-correlations of variables most relevant to coastal geomorphic evolution. This underlying information can then be used to make predictions. We demonstrate several examples of the utility of this approach using data as constraints and then propagating the constraints and uncertainty to make predictions of unobserved variables that include changes in shorelines, dunes, and overwash deposits. We draw on data from the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the United States, resolving time scales of years to a century. The examples include both short-term storm impacts and long-term evolution associated with sea-level rise. We show that the Bayesian network can solve problems of inference when the predictions require some form of assimilation or inverse modeling. And we illustrate some prediction scenarios where we are interested in simulating future conditions when constraints are more uncertain. The predictions are used to assess societal and ecological risks.",

            "abstract": "The decoupling between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a useful metric to characterize ecosystem hydrologic stress. As hydrologic stress evolves, PET increases following increases in incident radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). AET, on the other hand, remains stationary or decreases due to declines in surface conductance imposed by decreasing soil water and stomatal closure under high VPD. Historically, it has been difficult to quantify the extent to which soil moisture as compared to VPD ultimately limits AET during hydrologic stress. Part of this difficulty relates to the strong correlation between soil moisture and VPD at timescales over which hydrologic stress evolves (weekly to monthly). Further, while it is relatively easy to manipulate soil moisture in experimental settings, manipulating VPD is much more difficult. Recently, the proliferation of eddy covariance flux sites has produced a rich collection of AET observations at fine timescales (i.e. hourly to daily) over which VPD and soil moisture are more decoupled. In this study, we leverage such data to quantify the extent to which soil moisture versus VPD constrains AET in more than 25 Ameriflux sites spanning a wide climate gradient. We found that AET was most significantly limited by soil moisture in dry sites where the annual PET was much higher than precipitation. VPD limitations to AET dominated in wetter sites, but even among the driest sites, they were of similar magnitude to soil moisture limitations. Our results highlight the critical, if at time underappreciated, role of VPD in determining ecohydrological functioning during periods of hydrologic stress. We also leverage these results together with future projections for VPD, soil moisture, and other relevant meteorological drivers to explore the extent to which the coherence between VPD and soil moisture, and their relative importance for limiting AET, may shift under future climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "The highest regions of glaciated mountain ranges are characterised by cirques, arêtes and steep hillslopes. In addition, though, many ranges exhibit high, isolated, low-relief surfaces, which may provide an important record of landscape evolution. Broad, low-curvature surfaces, for example in the Laramide Ranges of the western United States, reflect periglacial regolith production and transport (e.g., Anderson, 2002). Here, the focus is on smaller surfaces that appear to be out of equilibrium with current/recent surface processes, and are interpreted as former glacial valley floors isolated from the current valley network.\nThe low-relief surfaces at the crest of the Sierra Nevada, California, are diamict covered. The top of Sardine Canyon is a beheaded cirque, while the cirque on the western side of Baxter Pass is in the process of being beheaded. Meanwhile, the isolated patch of diamict on the northeastern ridge of University Peak is surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs, and presumably represents a more evolved surface. It is inferred that the glaciated eastern Sierra Nevada is subject to a cycle of drainage capture and relief inversion, driven by headward erosion by cirque glaciers.\nThe central Himalaya contains a number of low-relief, ice-covered surfaces far above the rest of the glacial valley network (e.g., the Sakyetang Glacier, >6,600m, above the Kazhen Glacier, <5,400m). The ice at > 6,000m is frozen to the bedrock, so sub-glacial erosion will be outpaced by rock uplift. The extreme relief and active tectonics of the central Himalaya mean that drainage capture is not necessarily required in the generation of high, isolated, low-relief surfaces; glacial steps can become exaggerated to form reconstituted glaciers.\nHigh, isolated, low-relief surfaces are found across the Southern Alps, New Zealand, from Miserable Ridge and Kelly Saddle close to the western range front, through Urquhart Peak and Lake Browning near the Main Divide, to Kaimakamaka Peaks east of the Main Divide. As such, these surfaces may reflect uplift along the Alpine Fault, active tectonics at the Main Divide, or drainage reorganisation associated with either advection of topography across the Main Divide, or glacial processes.",

            "abstract": "Stimulation of shale gas reservoirs by hydraulic fracturing operations aims to increase the production rate by increasing the rock surface connected to the borehole. Prospective shales are often believed to display high strength and brittleness to decrease the breakdown pressure required to (re-) initiate a fracture as well as slow healing of natural and hydraulically induced fractures to increase the lifetime of the fracture network.\nLaboratory deformation tests were performed on several, mainly European black shales with different mineralogical composition, porosity and maturity at ambient and elevated pressures and temperatures. Mechanical properties such as compressive strength and elastic moduli strongly depend on shale composition, porosity, water content, structural anisotropy, and on pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions, but less on strain rate. We observed a transition from brittle to semibrittle deformation at high P-T conditions, in particular for high porosity shales. At given P-T conditions, the variation of compressive strength and Young’s modulus with composition can be roughly estimated from the volumetric proportion of all components including organic matter and pores.\nWe determined also brittleness index values based on pre-failure deformation behavior, Young’s modulus and bulk composition. At low P-T conditions, where samples showed pronounced post-failure weakening, brittleness may be empirically estimated from bulk composition or Young’s modulus. Similar to strength, at given P-T conditions, brittleness depends on the fraction of all components and not the amount of a specific component, e.g. clays, alone. Beside strength and brittleness, knowledge of the long term creep properties of shales is required to estimate in-situ stress anisotropy and the healing of (propped) hydraulic fractures.",

            "abstract": "Large sediment movements, such as deep-seated landslides, produce unstable sediment over the long term. Most of the unstable sediment in a mountain torrent is discharged via the development of debris flows through entrainment. Consequently, after a large sediment movement, debris flows have long-term effects on the watershed regime. However, the development of debris flows in mountain torrents is poorly understood, since the topography is more complicated than downstream. We compared temporal changes in topography to examine how topography affects the development of flows. The study site was the Ichino-sawa subwatershed in the Ohya-kuzure landslide, Japan. Unstable sediment has been produced continuously since the landslide occurred in 1707. Several topographic surveys using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and aerial shoots by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were performed between November 2011 (TLS) or November 2014 (UAV) and August 2015. High-resolution digital elevation models were created from the TLS and UAV results to detect temporal topographic changes. Debris flow occurrences and rainfall were also monitored using interval cameras and rain gauges. Downstream, the deposit depth decreased after the debris flows. Upstream, more complex changes were detected due to surges in the debris flows, which not only induced entrainment, but were also deposited in the valley floor. Furthermore, sediment was supplied from the stream bank during the debris flows. Consequently, several debris flows of different magnitudes were observed, although the rainfall conditions did not differ significantly. The results imply that the magnitude of the debris flows was affected by successive sediment movement resulting from the changing of the topographic conditions.",

In this hydrothermal field, two scientific drilling expeditions (IODP Exp 331 and SIP CK14-04) were conducted using a deep-sea drilling vessel \"Chikyu,\" and samples from a total of 27 holes were taken. Through these expeditions, Kuroko-type volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (VMS), hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks, and pumiceous and pelagic sediments were recovered. The recovered core provided important information about the relationship between hydrothermal activity, alteration, and ore mineralization.\nWhole-rock major element composition and trace element (TE) patterns of pumices were very similar to those of rhyolites in the middle Okinawa Trough (RMO). However, pumices were relatively enriched in chalcophile elements Sr and Nb, which suggest incipient mineralization. Volcanic rock generally demonstrated strong silicification and was greenish pale gray in color. Regardless of severe alteration, some rock displayed major element composition broadly similar to the RMO. Alteration was evidenced by an increase in the content of SiO2 and MgO, and decrease in Al2O3, Na2O, and K2O content. The most striking geochemical feature of altered volcanic rock was the discordance between texture and the degree of modification of TEs. Some samples showed decussate texture occupied by petal-like quartz with severe silicification, but no prominent disturbance of concentration and patterns of TEs were observed. In contrast, samples with well-preserved igneous porphyritic texture showed very low TE content and modification of TE patterns. These results suggest that the modification of texture and composition of TEs, as well as silicification, do not occur by a uniform process, but several processes. This may reflect the differences in temperature and the composition of the hydrothermal fluid.",

Its mission is to archive their wealth of peer-reviewed raw data and interpretations from magnetics studies on natural and synthetic samples. Many of these valuable data are legacy datasets that were never published in their entirety, some resided in other databases that are no longer maintained, and others were never digitized from the field notebooks and lab work. Due to the volume of data collected, most studies, modern and legacy, only publish the interpreted results and, occasionally, a subset of the raw data. MagIC is making an extraordinary effort to archive these data in a single data model, including the raw instrument measurements if possible. This facilitates the reproducibility of the interpretations, the re-interpretation of the raw data as the community introduces new techniques, and the compilation of heterogeneous datasets that are otherwise distributed across multiple formats and physical locations.\nMagIC has developed tools to assist the scientific community in many stages of their workflow. Contributors easily share studies (in a private mode if so desired) in the MagIC Database with colleagues and reviewers prior to publication, publish the data online after the study is peer reviewed, and visualize their data in the context of the rest of the contributions to the MagIC Database. From organizing their data in the MagIC Data Model with an online editable spreadsheet, to validating the integrity of the dataset with automated plots and statistics, MagIC is continually lowering the barriers to transforming dark data into transparent and reproducible datasets.

Depending on the distance of an ENA to the source of a gravitational field and its relative speed and direction this can result in a significant deflection and acceleration. In this presentation we study the impact of the gravitational effects of the Earth, Moon, and Jupiter on ENA measurements performed in Earth orbit. We show that planetary gravitational effects do not significantly affect the interstellar neutral gas parameters obtained from IBEX observations. We further study the possibility whether the He focusing cone of the Sun or Jupiter could be measured by IBEX, and whether these cones could be used as an independent measure of the interstellar He temperature. These topics are of particular importance for future missions such as IMAP, which will provide ENA images for a broader energy range and with better sensitivity and resolution.",

            "abstract": "Although the Oman ophiolite is classically regarded as being the direct analog of oceanic lithosphere created at fast spreading ridges, the geodynamic context of its formation is still highly debated. The other alternative end-member model suggests that this ophiolite entirely formed in a supra-subduction zone setting. The latter one is supported by studies on volcanic sequences whereas studies dealing on the mantle section do not involve a significant influence of subduction processes on its structure and composition.\nWe herein focus on basal peridotites from all along the ophiolite strike in order to decipher and characterize potential fluid/melt transfers relate to subduction processes. Samples were taken across the basal banded unit directly overlying the amphibolitic/granulitic metamorphic sole which represents an accreted part of the lower plate. We carried out a petrological, structural and geochemical study on these rocks and their constitutive minerals.\nOur results show that basal peridotites range from lherzolites to highly depleted harzburgites in composition. Clinopyroxenes (cpx) display melt impregnation textures and co-crystallized with HT/HP amphiboles (amph), spinels and sulfurs. Major and trace elements of the constitutive minerals indicate that these minerals represent trapped incremental partial melt after hydrous melting. Different cpx-bearing lithologies then result from varying degrees of partial melting and melt extraction. Combined with Boron isotopic data, we demonstrate that fluids responsible for hydrous melting of these ophiolitic basal peridotites are subduction-related, most likely derived from dehydration of the metamorphic sole during its formation in subduction initiation.\nFrom these observations and thermal constraints, we interpret the occurrence of these basal lherzolites as representing a freezing front developed by thermal re-equilibration (cooling) during subduction processes: subduction-related hydrous partial melts were extracted at different degrees until getting ultimately trapped, and crystallized cpx, amph and other associated minerals.\nIf our interpretation is correct, the base of the Oman ophiolite could provide the best proxy for the composition of a frozen-in, incipiently forming mantle wedge.",

From previous studies, atmosphere-only simulations have a tendency to produce higher number of cyclones compared to observations. In this study, REMO coupled with the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model or ROM, which is a regional atmosphere coupled with a global ocean model, is used to evaluate the impact of the atmosphere-ocean interaction to the tropical climate focusing on the typhoon activities. The aim is to identify the importance of the atmosphere-ocean coupling in the CORDEX Southeast Asia domain. The model domain spans 80 E to 180E and -15 S to 40 N, with a horizontal resolution of about 50 km and 27 hybrid vertical levels. The model is driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and run from the period of 1980 to 2012. To compare the influence of atmosphere-ocean coupling, the atmospheric model is also run uncoupled. Results on the simulated precipitation and temperature are compared to observations as well the changes in the tropical cyclone activity. Preliminary results indicate that the warm and wet biases over the ocean in the uncoupled simulations are reduced in the coupled simulations especially during the typhoon season. The frequency of typhoon occurrences is lower compared to the uncoupled model and is comparable to observations.",

            "abstract": "Impacts of climate change on water resources in Europe have been studied using multiple climate, hydrological and downscaling models and at multiple scales. Although results seem to differ largely between these studies, robust qualitative results have emerged at the European scale. Generally, a drying trend coupled with more intense extremes (floods & droughts) is observed in southern Europe, whereas a wetting trend coupled with less intense extremes is observed in Northern Europe. The location of the change between wetting and drying leads to uncertainty of climate change impacts in central Europe. Also, temperature-related hydrological processes lead to more robust predictions than precipitation-related processes as climate models are more consistent for temperature. For European hydrology, this leads to more robust predictions in regions with snow-dominated hydrology and where evapotranspiration dominates the water cycle. Robust predictions of changes to the seasonality of discharge are seen in snow-dominated regions (Fennoscandinavia, Alps) while robust predictions of decreases in runoff are seen for the Iberian peninsula. While uncertainty in the projections mostly comes from climate uncertainty, predictions of impacts on soil moisture and low flows can be largely dependent on the choice of hydrological model where methods to estimate evapotranspiration and runoff differ widely. While the regional-scale results show some robustness, there can be large local-scale differences even where the same catchment is considered at different scales. Furthermore, understanding of uncertainties due to correction and downscaling procedures are only beginning to emerge. Our evaluations of bias-correction indicate that uncertainties vary considerably depending on the variable. The scale of uncertainty due to bias-correction can be similar to the projected climate changes and to the uncertainty from the climate models. In this presentation we put forward a new bottom-up method for climate change impact studies where the regional-scale results and their known uncertainties are considered together with local-scale studies designed specifically for the changes to which a system must be adapted. We illustrate the value of the new method in a number of real case studies for various societal sectors.",

            "abstract": "The Divnogorie Nature Park is in the basin of the middle Don River. Tectonically, it sits on the Ostrogozhskoye Neotectonic Uplift, a recent extension of the northern wing of the Voronezh Anteclise of the Russian Platform. The neotectonic uplift amplitude of this structure is estimated at more than 200 m. A structural geomorphological study of the area has shown that the Ostrogozhskoye Uplift is an actively growing structure. This is clearly demonstrated by the following: dramatic changes in the flow direction of the rivers Don and Tikhaya Sosna, forced to bypass the growing upland; instances of damming up, which created numerous oxbow lakes and led to waterlogging in floodplains; increase in the density of the erosion grid on the upland; fall of the groundwater table (Romanovskaya, 2015). Uplifting has intensified erosion and slope wash processes, forming numerous canyon-shaped ravines, very steep slopes (>60º) and interconnected bastion-like relief forms.\nSuperimposed on the geology of the area, neotectonic movements and erosion have led to the formation of a peculiar relief (chalk outliers), microclimate and ecosystem (petrophytic steppe). Surrounded by protections in the form of steep slopes and water courses, this area is a natural fortress which has favored human habitation since the Late Paleolithic Age. In a location in the Tikhaya Sosna river basin, gully erosion has exposed a large accumulation of ancient horse (Equus caballus) bones. Now this location (50.9649ºN, 39.3031ºE) is known as the Upper Paleolithic (13.5-14 kaBP) multi-level archaeological site Divnogorie-9. About 8,000 horse bones and 65 human-made stone artifacts have been discovered here in Late Pleistocene diluvial-alluvial-colluvial deposits (Kuznetsova, 2014). The mass die-off of wild horses and their reburial at the site are most probably the result of landscape and geological impact of massive temporary water flows that will be addressed in some detail in the actual presentation of the study.\n  ",

Hydrologic impacts under a changing climate include rising seas, reduced ratio of snow to rain, earlier snowmelt and higher temperatures; all of which are being detected.\nTo improve the scientific basis for decisions and enhance the consistency of climate change approaches, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) empaneled a Climate Change Technical Advisory Group (CCTAG) for guidance on the scientific aspects of climate change, its impacts on water resources, the use and creation of planning approaches and analytical tools, and the development of adaptation responses.\nTo carry out DWR’s mission, incorporation of climate change into DWR’s planning, projects, and other activities must be consistent, science-based, and continually improved through an iterative process. Hydrologists, academicians, modelers, planners, lawyers and practitioners convened regularly to tackle these complicated issues in water management policy, including climate change impacts on extreme events. Actions taken in response to the CCTAG recommendations will move California toward more sustainable management of water and related resources. DWR will release a technical report of CCTAG guidance and perspectives in 2015.\nThe process to convene, collaborate and distribute the findings of this CCTAG will be the focus of this presentation. An academician and water resources practitioner will share their perspectives on the processes driving CCTAG’s work.",

            "abstract": "Permeable nearshore aquifers are an important biogeochemical hotspot for nitrogen (N) cycling. Located at the land-sea interface this hotspot has been shown to regulate N fluxes to coastal waters via submarine groundwater discharge. N transformations in a nearshore aquifer may result in either a net production or net removal of NO3- with the transformations controlled by complex interacting physical transport and biogeochemical kinetic processes. Oceanic forcing including tides and waves cause large quantities of seawater and chemical constituents, including dissolved oxygen and organic matter, to recirculate through the nearshore aquifer. There is currently limited understanding of the impact of the oceanic forcing on the residence time of recirculating constituents and the subsequent implications on N transformations in the aquifer. A numerical model was applied to quantify the influence of varying tidal and wave conditions on residence times and evaluate how the interactions between the coupled transport and reaction kinetics control N transformations and fluxes. Simulations were performed using the variable-density groundwater flow model SEAWAT-2005 combined with the reactive multi-component transport model PHT3D v2.10. The model simulated the transport and transformation of both marine- and land-derived chemical consitituents and considered oxic DOM mineralization, nitrification and denitrification. Simulations demonstrate that the recirculation residence times, combined with oxygen removal rates, regulate whether a nearshore aquifer will act as a net source or sink of NO3. Dimensionless Damköhler numbers calculated as the ratio of the characteristic residence time to characterisitic oxygen reaction time were determined and provide valuable insight into the residence time controls on the ultimate flux of N to the sea.",

            "abstract": "The 2015 deep-focus earthquake off the Ogasawara Islands, Japan (Mw 7.9, 680 km depth) caused strong ground motion that was felt over whole Japan with a maximum seismic intensity of 5-upper on the JMA scale. The observed seismic intensity in east Japan was larger than that in west Japan even if they were observed at the equal hypocentral distance. To understand the attenuation characteristics of strong ground motion from deep-focus earthquakes around the Ogasawara Islands, we investigate the period-dependent characteristics of their strong ground motion using response acceleration spectra (Sa) and conduct a regression analysis of the ground motion prediction equation for Sa.\nFirst, using waveforms recorded by F-net of NIED during the 2015 event, we obtained 5 % damped horizontal Sa in the period from 0.1 s to 10 s at F-net stations. In the long period band (≥ 4 s), Sa in east Japan is comparable to that in west Japan at the equal hypocentral distance. On the other hand, in the short period band (≤ 1 s), Sa in east Japan is much larger than that in west Japan at the equal hypocentral distance. We also obtained Sa at F-net stations for four other deep-focus earthquakes around the Ogasawara Islands. They also have a trend similar to that of the 2015 event.\nThen, we evaluated the ground motion prediction equation for Sa whose parameters are Mw and hypocentral distance X: log Sa = a*Mw + (R1*b1+R2*b2)*X - log X + c. In this equation, we assumed the geometric attenuation of body waves. b1 and b2 are coefficients in west and east Japan for the attenuation except for the geometric attenuation, respectively. R1 is 1 and 0 at stations in west and east Japan, respectively, and R2 is vice versa. The regression coefficients (a, b1, b2, and c) were estimated by the two-step linear regression analysis (Kataoka et al., 2008). In the long period band (≥ 4 s), there is not much difference between the values of b1 and b2. On the other hand, in the short period band (≤ 1 s), the absolute value of b2 is small compared to that of b1. This result indicates that the internal and/or scattering attenuation along the wave path from the deep Ogasawara-Islands region to east Japan is weaker than that along the wave path to west Japan. This is expected to be caused by whether there is a high-Q subducting oceanic plate along the wave path or not.",

The coefficient of variation (CV), i.e., the ratio of standard deviation to mean value for <100-nm particle number concentration (N100) in every 30 s, is introduced as a metric to distinguish horizontal and vertical transport of atmospheric particles. We first examined the CV metric using the data collected at a semi-urban site in Toronto during the summer of 2007. The 50th and 95th percentiles of CVs associated with horizontal transport were 1-13 times smaller than those during strong vertical transport. We then compared the N100, GMD55 (geometric mean diameter of <55-nm particles) and GMD100 corresponding to the 0-5th percentiles of CVs with those corresponding to the 95-100thpercentiles of CVs in five NPF events (Fig. 1). The comparative results are discussed in terms of different formation and growth rates in the vertical direction. The similar analysis was also conducted in various marine atmospheres. We found that the CV metric can improve our understanding of NPF in the vertical direction.\nFig. 1 Time series of N100, GMD55, GMD100 corresponding to 95-100th percentile (left panel) and 0-5th percentile of CVs (right panel) for N100 in five NPF events (Case 5-9).",

            "abstract": "We present an active tectonic model of the SE Alaska – SW Yukon region based principally on the integration of recent GPS velocity data and new fault-slip rates derived from geomorphology. In this region, the Yakutat collision results in complex tectonics with patterns of strain localization and strain partitioning that strongly vary across the various mountain ranges and active faults. We propose that deformation and fault activity in the St. Elias and Chugach Mountains are primarily controlled by the eastern syntaxis of the Yakutat collision, which produces a semi-radial tectonic pattern: Velocities, principal horizontal shortening rates, and maximum horizontal stress orientations rotate by 60 – 80 ° around the syntaxis, from roughly parallel to the relative Pacific – North America motion at the front of the collision to roughly orthogonal southeast of the syntaxis. The interaction between this strain pattern and major inherited tectonic structures inland of the collision zone (i.e., Denali and Duke River Faults) results in various reactivation modes of these structures. Specifically, the Denali Fault shows a very pronounced lateral variations of activity from ~12 mm/a of dextral slip rate in its central section to ~1 mm/a of mostly shortening slip rate along its southern section. This marked change of activity is associated with a possible relay system where the Duke River and Totschunda Faults accommodate a major part (8 – 12 mm/a) of the inland strain transfer directly in front of the syntaxis. This new tectonic model retains some questions, in particular regarding the mechanisms of deformation and strain transfer (1) from the syntaxis to the Duke River – Totschunda system and (2) at the junction between Totschunda and Denali Faults. Numerical models of present-day deformation may help address these issues and provide information about relative strength of the various crustal and inherited fault elements of this system.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's magnetospheric cusp provides direct access of energetic particles to the thermosphere. These particles produce ionization and kinetic (particle) heating of the atmosphere. The increased ionization coupled with enhanced electric fields in the cusp produces increased Joule heating and ion drag forcing. These energy inputs cause large wind and temperature changes in the cusp region. Measurements by the CHAMP satellite (460-390- km altitude) have shown strongly enhanced density in the cusp region. The Streak mission (325-123 km), on the other hand, showed a relative depletion.\nThe atmospheric response in the cusp can be sensitive to composition and neutral density changes. In response to heating in the cusp, air of heavier mean molecular weight is brought up from lower altitudes significantly affecting pressure gradients. This opposes the effects of temperature change due to heating and in-turn affects the density and winds produced in the cusp. Also changes in neutral density change the interaction between precipitating particles and the atmosphere and thus change heating rates and ionization in the region affected by cusp precipitation.\nIn this study we assess the sensitivity of the wind and neutral density structure in the cusp region to changes in the mean molecular weight induced by neutral dynamics, and the changes in particle heating rates and ionization which result from changes in neutral density. We use a high resolution two-dimensional time-dependent nonhydrostatic nonlinear dynamical model where inputs can be systematically altered. The resolution of the model allows us to examine the complete range of cusp widths. We compare the current simulations to observations by CHAMP and Streak.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by The Aerospace Corporation’s Technical Investment program",

            "abstract": "The plate tectonic theory allowed to split the Earth surface into 6 (Le Pichon 1968) to 52 tectonic plates (Bird 2003). These plates are separated into two groups: the first of 7 large plates and the second of numerous smaller plates (Morra et al 2013). Previous studies using the reconstruction of the past 200 My, suggest that the size of large plates is driven by mantle flow. But the tools employed are descriptive (Morra et al 2013, Sornette and Pisarenko 2003), hence ignoring forces and physical principles within the lithosphere and the mantle. The processes at the origin of small plates remain unknown.\nWe developed a new approach to explain the plate sizes. We demonstrate that the physics of convection drives it. We applied plate tectonics theory on 3D spherical convection models generating plate-like motions, which give access to a complete survey of data: velocities, viscosity and heat flow.\nOur data show that (1) the large plates depend on the dominating scale of the convective flow due to the initiation or the shutdown of subductions; (2) the smaller plates are generated thanks to large variability of regional stresses along subduction zone by slab pull and suction influenced by the geometry of trenches.\nOur results are consistent with the quick reorganizations of back-arc basins occuring synchronously with the modification of subduction zones geometry around the Pacific plate (Sdrolias et al 2004). Hence, we conclude that (1) the decreasing number of small plates in the plate reconstructions back in time is an artifact induced by their short lifetime, that is why they are artificially ignored; (2) the geometry of past trenches is simplified leading to an underestimation of the length of subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Historically the Midwestern United State was a region dominated by prairie grasses and wetlands. To make use of the rich soils underlying these fertile environments, farmers converted the land to agriculture and currently the Midwest is a region of intensive agricultural production, with agriculture being a predominant land use. The Midwest is a region of gentle slopes, tight soils, and high water tables, and in order to make the lands suitable for agriculture, farmers have installed extensive networks of ditches to drain off excess surface water and subsurface tiles to lower the water table and remove excess soil water in the root zone that can stress common row crops, such as corn and soybeans. The combination of tiles, ditches, and intensive agricultural land practices radically alters the landscape and hydrology. As part of the Minnesota River Basin Integrated Study we are simulating nested watersheds in a sub-basin of the Minnesota River Basin, Seven Mile Creek, using the physics-based watershed model GSSHA (Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis) to simulate water, sediment, and nutrients. Representative of the larger basin, more than 80% of the land in the watershed is dedicated to agricultural practices. From a process perspective, the hydrology is complicated, with snow accumulation and melt, frozen soil, and tile drains all being important processes within the watershed. In this study we attempt to explicitly simulate these processes, including the tile drains, which are simulated as a network of subsurface pipes that collect water from the local water table. Within the watershed, tiles discharge to both the ditch/stream network as well as overland locations, where the tile discharge appears to initiate gullies and exacerbate overland erosion. Testing of the methods on smaller basins demonstrates the ability of the model to simulate measured tile flow. At the larger scale, the model demonstrates ability to simulate flow and sediments. Sparse nutrient data limit the assessment of nutrient simulations. The models are being used to asses an array of potential future land use scenarios, including predevelopment and increased agricultural use. Results from these simulations will be presented. Preliminary results indicate that tile drains increase discharge and erosion in the watershed.",

The origin of this 17O excess is under debate: tropospheric and stratospheric in-situ sources as well as isotope fractionation and isotope exchange during biological N2O production are all considered to make a contribution, as might the stratospheric photolysis sink. To constrain the relative contributions of the different processes and to improve our understanding of the underlying atmospheric chemical and microbial processes, more measurements are required.\nWe have measured the 17O excess of stratospheric samples from mid-latitudes, from altitudes between 8 and 26 km. N2O was extracted cryogenically, separated from CO2 and CHF3 by a PoraPlotQ pre-column and then thermally decomposed in a gold furnace at 900 ºC. The precision for the 17O excess of a single 5 nmol N2O aliquot was ±0.3 ‰.\nThis dataset significantly enhances the limited range of oxygen triple isotope measurements in mostly lower stratospheric samples reported by Cliff et al. (1999). The average 17O excess of the stratospheric samples analysed was (-0.19 ±0.46) ‰ relative to tropospheric N2O.\nSince the 17O excess of the first measurements of stratospheric air is not significantly different to that in tropospheric air, this data suggests that the 17O excess is not of stratospheric origin. This confirms the idea that the origin of the 17O excess is not due to either stratospheric photolysis or reaction with electronically excited oxygen atoms. It suggests that the origin of the 17O excess may therefore be related to tropospheric in situ sources, e.g. NH2+NO2 as proposed by Röckmann et al., 2001, or to microbial nitrogen conversion reactions as suggested by Kaiser and Röckmann, 2005.",

Statistical methodology based on multiple linear regression is employed, and applied to monthly temperature data for the 1901-2010 period. The results presented illustrate the spatial fingerprints of individual forcing factors and their robustness (or lack thereof) among individual temperature datasets. Particular attention is devoted to the specific features of the 20th Century Reanalysis: It is demonstrated that while most of the response patterns are represented similarly in the reanalysis data and in their analysis-type counterparts, some distinctions appear, especially for the components associated with anthropogenic forcing and volcanic activity.",

However, the resulting spatial-temporal pattern of flooding and its influence on riparian vegetation has not been quantified in a spatially explicit way. Here we focused on the floodplains of the entire Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), an area that covers over 1M km^2, as a case study. The MDB is the country’s primary agricultural area with scarce water resources subject to competing demands and impacted by climate change and more recently by the Millennium Drought (1999-2009). Riparian vegetation in the MDB floodplain suffered extensive decline providing a dramatic degradation of riparian vegetation.\nWe quantified the spatial-temporal impact of rainfall, temperature and flooding patters on vegetation dynamics at the sub- continental to local scales and across inter to intra-annual time scales based on three decades of Landsat (25k images), Bureau of Meteorology data and one decade of MODIS data.\nVegetation response varied in space and time and with vegetation types, densities and location relative to areas frequently flooded. Vegetation degradation trends were observed over riparian forests and woodlands in areas where flooding regimes have changed to less frequent and smaller inundation extents. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation phenology followed primarily a ‘boom’ and ‘bust’ cycle, related to inter-annual rainfall variability. Spatial patters of vegetation degradation changed along the N-S rainfall gradient but flooding regimes and vegetation degradation patterns also varied at finer scale, highlighting the importance of a spatially explicit, internally consistent analysis and setting the stage for investigating further cross-scale relationships.\nResults are of interest for land and water management decisions. The approach developed here can be applied to other areas globally such as the Nile river basin and Okavango River delta in Africa or the Mekong River Basin in Southeast Asia.",

This anomalous character can be traced back to the existence of multiscale heterogeneity and strong correlations within the medium. Here we investigate the impact of fast heterogeneous mass transfer properties as represented by a spatially varying retardation coefficient (mass exchange between mobile and immobile regions, linear sorption-desorption reactions, variable porosity). In order to estimate the effects of spatial correlation, and disorder distribution on the average transport, we consider 2D media characterized by complex multiscale geometries and point distributions of retardation of increasing heterogeneity. Within a Lagrangian framework, we coarse-grain the Langevin equation for the transport of solute particles due to advection and diffusion in the heterogeneous medium. The large-scale transport properties are derived within a stochastic modeling approach by ensemble averaging of the coarse-grained Langevin equation . This approach shows that the effective particle motion can be described by a coupled CTRW that is fully parametrized by the distribution of the retardation coefficient and the spatial medium organization. This allows for the explicit relation of the heterogeneous medium properties to observed anomalous transport in terms of solute dispersion, breakthrough curves and spatial concentration profiles.",

            "abstract": "Foliar nitrogen (N) is know to acclimate to environmental conditions. One particular pertinent response is the general decline in foliar N following exposure to elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 (eCO2). Associated with reduced foliar N is an increased plant nitrogen-use efficiency, which contributes to the plants' sustained growth response to eCO2 in the absence of any counteracting litter N feedbacks. Flexible leaf N thus has important consequences for the mid- to long-term response of terrestrial ecosystems to eCO2.\nThe current generation of land-surface models including a prognostic N cycle generally employ heuristic, and simply mass-balancing parameterisations to estimate changes in stoichiometry given altered N and carbon (C) availability. This generation generally and substantially overestimates the decline of foliar N (and thus the increase in plant nitrogen use efficiency) observed in Free Air CO2 Enrichment Experiments (FACE; Zaehle et al. 2014). In this presentation, I develop a simple, prognostic and dynamic representation of flexible foliar N for use in land-surface models by maximising the marginal gain of net assimilation with respect to the energy investment to generate foliar area and foliar N. I elucidate the underlying assumptions required to simulate the commonly observed decline in foliar N with eCO2 under different scenarios of N availability (Feng et al. 2015).\n",

            "abstract": "This study presents a new method for representing permanent afforestation in Earth System models. Afforestation has attracted interest as an option to help to slow or reverse the growth of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the next century. However, its potential is poorly constrained with regard to land availability, rates of tree growth and carbon accumulation, and potential side effects.\nThis study aims to provide quantitative assessment of the carbon removal potential and side effects of 21st century afforestation using a dynamic global vegetation model, in contrast to the majority of previous estimates which have used bookkeeping methods.\nThe land surface model JULES was used to simulate needleleaf afforestation on abandoned agricultural land during the 21st century under two future pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). These results are compared to a control scenario in which natural succession is allowed to act on the same area of land.\nThis study finds considerable spatial variation in the final carbon sequestration potential of afforestation sites. In addition to dieback and marginal growth in many regions, many sites showed minimal additionality of forest areas compared to natural succession. The most suitable sites were in Eastern Europe, central China and central North America. There was no major difference in the general spatial pattern of suitability between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 by 2100.\nOverall, this study produced a significantly smaller estimate of the CDR potential of permanent afforestation than previous studies have. The additional carbon stored in suitable sites by 2100 was only 19 Pg C (RCP4.5) and 2.1 Pg C (RCP8.5), a mean of 68 tC/ha.\nThis research also explored the biogeophysical impacts of afforestation on surface energy balance and hydrological cycles. The decrease in albedo caused by afforestation significantly offset the radiative forcing benefits of the carbon removal, although this effect was very sensitive to input assumptions. Flooding results suggested that at realistic levels of afforestation, river water supply and flooding regimes are unlikely to be affected at regional scales. The effect of afforestation on fire risk was mixed, with many suitable sites showing little effect while in others the risk was significantly lower or higher.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of the effect of carbon-related forestland management activities on ecosystem services is difficult, because knowledge about the dynamics of coupled social-ecological systems is lacking. Different forestland management activities, such as various amount, timing, and methods of harvesting, and natural disturbances events, such as wind and fires, create shocks and uncertainties to the forest carbon dynamics. A spatially explicit model, Landis-ii, was used to model the forest succession for different harvest management scenarios at the Grandfather District, North Carolina. In addition to harvest, the model takes into account of the impact of natural disturbances, such as fire and insects, and species competition. The result shows the storage of carbon in standing biomass and in wood product for each species for each scenario. In this study, optimization is used to analyze the maximum profit and the number of tree species that each forest landowner can gain at different prices of carbon, roundwood, and interest rates for different harvest management scenarios. Time series of roundwood production of different types were estimated using remote sensing data. Econometric analysis is done to understand the possible interaction and relations between the production of different types of roundwood and roundwood prices, which can indicate the possible planting scheme that a forest owner may make. This study quantifies the tradeoffs between carbon sequestration, roundwood production, and forest species diversity not only from an economic perspective, but also takes into account of the forest succession mechanism in a species-diverse region. The resulting economic impact on the forest landowners is likely to influence their future planting decision, which in turn, will influence the species composition and future revenue of the landowners.",

            "abstract": "Cold marine sediments harbour inactive spores of thermophilic bacteria. These misplaced thermophiles are genetically similar to microorganisms detected in deep biosphere environments, leading to the hypothesis that seabed fluid flow transports thermophiles out of warm subsurface environments and into the ocean. Estuaries form the transition between the marine and the terrestrial biosphere and are influenced by tidal currents, surface run-off and groundwater seepage. Endospores from thermophilic bacteria present in estuarine sediments could therefore originate from a number of sources that may influence the estuary differently. We have therefore tested the hypothesis that this will lead to a gradient in the composition of thermophilic endospore populations in estuarine sediments. The distribution of thermophilic spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria along an estuarine gradient from freshwater (River Tyne, UK) to marine (North Sea) was investigated. Microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed changes in the thermophilic population enriched at different locations within the estuary. Certain species were only detected at the marine end, highlighting possible links to deep marine biosphere habitats such as oil reservoirs that harbour closely related Desulfotomaculum spp. Conversely, other taxa were predominantly observed in the freshwater reaches of the estuary indicating dispersal from an upstream or terrestrial source. Different endospore populations were enriched dependent on incubation temperature and spore heat-resistance. Microcosms incubated at 50, 60 or 70°C showed a shift in the dominant species of Desulfotomaculum enriched as the temperature increased. Microcosms triple-autoclaved at 121°C prior to incubation still showed rapid and reproducible sulfate-reduction and some Desulfotomaculum spp. remained active after autoclaving at 130°C. These results show that temperature physiology and biogeographic patterns can be used to reveal insights into the passive transport of microorganisms in estuarine environments.",

Spatio-temporal variability of potential drivers – hydroclimate and water use – influencing the freshwater sustainability are examined both individually as well as collectively by considering the eco-region and 4-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-4)as the spatial reference for the analysis. A detailed multivariate analysis relating the potential drivers with downstream flow anomalies indicate that changes in hydroclimate and water use adequately quantify the variability in downstream anomalies, but their signature varies significnatly across various regions of the CONUS. Results from the analysis indicate that both hydroclimatic extremes and mean annual fluxes control, but their signature alos vary across the CONUS. Among the changes in water use, irrigation water use predominantly carries the signature in explaining the downstream flow anomalies. To adequately express the sensitivity of downstream flow anomalies to hydroclimate and water use, we compute the elasticity of downstream flow anomalies to changes in hydroclimate and water use for each HUC8 regions of the US. Differences between the multivariate analysis and the elasticity estimates of freshwater sustainability are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Beginning nearly 50 years ago with a paleomagnetic study of exposed lacustrine sediments in the Mono Basin, CA (Denham and Cox, 1971), there have been subsequent studies to document paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) in the basin and to establish a chronology for that record (Vazquez and Lidzbarski, 2012). We report a paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) investigation of lacustrine sediments in the Mono Basin, CA, that extends the base of the PSV record of Lund et al. (1988) by about 20 percent. We did our investigation at two localities separated by about 4 km on the southeastern and eastern sides of Mono Lake: South Shore Cliffs (SSC) and Warm Springs (WS). The sampled interval at SSC is from 0.1 m above to 2.2 m below Wilson Creek Ash 19 in the tephrostratigraphy of Lajoie (1968), ending in loose sand. At WS, we sampled from Ash 17 to 1.0 m below Ash 19, a total of 2 m.\nAt SSC using back-to-back horizons 2-cm thick containing one to three samples each that were a.f. or thermally demagnetized, we found rapidly fluctuating PSV in the interval from ~ 0.3 to 1.0 m below Ash 19. The fluctuating PSV contains a change in declination of ~ 80˚ from 308˚ (n = 3, α-95: 6.1˚) to 29˚ (n = 3, α-95: 11.5˚) within a single hand sample that spans 14 cm. Inclination during that change in declination gradually rose from 56˚ to 63˚ and increased to 70˚ before reducing to a minimum of 29.9˚. The path of the Virtual Geomagnetic Poles when the declination is most westerly forms a narrow loop that reaches 49.7˚ N latitude near 170˚ E longitude. At WS the westerly swing in declination is absent, but the easterly declination and relatively steep inclination described above are recorded.\nA study of the relative paleomagnetic intensity (RPI) shows that the maximum RPI is ~1.5 m below Ash 19 and decreases to a minimum ~6 cm above the ash. Distinct PSV and RPI features below the Mono Lake excursion correlate well between records from the periphery of Mono Lake and those from Pyramid Lake, NV (Benson et al., 2008) and Summer Lake, OR (Negrini et al., 2014). Also, the corresponding features in the Pyramid Lake record occur above the Laschamp Excursion. This supports the hypothesis that the sediments exposed around Mono Lake above the Wilson Creek Formation basal gravel layer and its equivalent sandy deposits are younger than the age of the Laschamp Excursion (~40 ka).",

Hypotheses associated with magmatic process have been proposed for the mechanisms of these DLPs, including dehydration embrittlement, flow of magma and/or magmatic fluid and cooling of magma. DLPs are commonly characterized by weak signal on the waveforms, deficiency in high-frequency energy, long-duration coda and their rare occurrence. They are located at 10-35 km depth, which are the mid- to lower-crust and/or uppermost mantle.\nThe imaging Magma Under St Helens (iMUSH) experiment began in late June 2014, and since then the broadband seismometers have recorded six DLPs, two of which are also captured by dense array of Nodal stations. We use the iMUSH data and seismic data from nearby network stations to study the DLPs beneath St. Helens. Catalog DLPs are taken as templates to search for repeating events that might be too small to be detected otherwise. So far, we have searched for cross-station correlation detections for four template DLPs for the period 2007 to 2015. Three of the four seems to be isolated one-offs, while the fourth has at least 56 repetitions, three times more than were already in the catalog, and hints of many more. Many of the DLPs have several bursts within tens of seconds or several minutes.\nOverall the DLPs show an episodic activity with a period of roughly sixteen months. Several, but not all, episodes are temporally correlated with the subduction zone tremor activity west of St. Helens (Figure 1), which we are still investigating. We are locating these detections, and preliminary results suggest concentrated loci within a distance of one or two kilometers.\nWe will conduct correlations between all detections, search farther back in time, and search with other templates as well, to better characterize their timeline and fine-scale geometry and analyze the waveforms to understand their physical mechanisms and the complicated pattern of arrivals observed to traverse the midcrust directly under the volcano.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is likely to affect food and water security in India. India has witnessed tremendous growth in its food production after the green revolution. However, during the recent decades the food grain yields were significantly affected by the extreme climate and weather events. Air temperature and associated extreme events (number of hot days and hot nights, heat waves) increased significantly during the last 50 years in the majority of India. More remarkably, a substantial increase in mean and extreme temperatures was observed during the winter season in India. On the other hand, India witnessed extreme flood and drought events that have become frequent during the past few decades. Extreme rainfall during the non-monsoon season adversely affected the food grain yields and results in tremendous losses in several parts of the country. Here we evaluate the changes in hydroclimatic extremes and its linkage with the food grain production in India. We use observed food grain yield data for the period of 1980-2012 at district level. We understand the linkages between food grain yield and crop phenology obtained from the high resolution leaf area index and NDVI datasets from satellites. We used long-term observed data of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures to evaluate changes in the extreme events. We use statistical models to develop relationships between crop yields, mean and extreme temperatures for various crops to understand the sensitivity of these crops towards changing climatic conditions. We find that some of the major crop types and predominant crop growing areas have shown a significant sensitivity towards changes in extreme climatic conditions in India.",

            "abstract": "Several mantle peridotite massifs crop out as isolated dismembered bodies in tectonic belts along the northern margin of the Caribbean plate. Among these bodies, the Loma Caribe peridotite forms the core of the Median Belt in central Dominican Republic. This peridotite massif is mainly composed of Cpx-bearing harzburgite, harzburgite, lherzolite and (Opx-bearing) dunite, locally intruded by gabbroic rocks of Barremian age (~ 125 Ma). Mg# of olivine increases from lower values in lherzolite (90), to higher values in Cpx-harzburgite (91), harzburgite (92) and dunite (92-94). Cr# of spinel spans from 0.23 in lherzolite to 0.87 in dunite, and progressively increases from fertile to refractory lithologies. These variations overlap the mineral compositions of both abyssal and supra-subduction zone peridotites. The sample/chondrite REE concentrations of whole rocks are variable (0.002 < LREEN < 0.11 and 0.003 < HREEN < 1.02), and the HREE contents generally reflect the fertility of the samples. Similar to mineral chemistry, these trace element abundances overlap the compositions of both highly depleted supra-subduction and more fertile abyssal peridotites. Peridotites are variably enriched in the most incompatible and fluid-mobile trace elements (Cs, Rb, Ba, Th, U and Pb), and show negative anomalies of Nb and Ta. MREE/HREE fractionations in whole rocks and clinopyroxene support that these rocks are residues after initial fractional melting (~ 4%) in the garnet stability field and additional melting (~ 5-15%) in the spinel peridotite facies. The relative enrichment in incompatible and fluid-mobile elements (e.g., LILE and LREE) probably resulted from interaction of melting residues with ascending fluids/melts. We interpret the compositional variability of the Loma Caribe peridotite as reflecting different stages of generation of sub-oceanic mantle lithosphere during the Lower Cretaceous initiation of subduction beneath the Greater Antilles Paleo-arc.",

Data were collected at the end of July 2015 over a supraglacial watershed terminating in the Kangerlussuaq region of Greenland and following the Utrecht University K-Transect of meteorological stations. The aerial photography reported here were complementary observations used to support hyperspectral measurements of albedo, discussed in the Greenland Ice sheet hydrology session of this AGU Fall meeting. A compact digital camera was installed inside a pod mounted on the side of the helicopter together with gyroscopes and accelerometers that were used to estimate the relative orientation. Continuous video was collected on 19 and 21 July flights, and frames extracted from the videos are used to create a series of aerial photos. Individual geo-located aerial photos were also taken on a 24 July flight. We demonstrate that by maintaining a constant flight elevation and a near constant ground speed, a helicopter with a mounted camera can produce 3-D structure of the ablation zone of the ice sheet at unprecedented spatial resolution of the order of 5 – 10 cm. By setting the intervalometer on the camera to 2 seconds, the images obtained provide sufficient overlap (>60%) for digital image alignment, even at a flight elevation of ~170m. As a result, very accurate point matching between photographs can be achieved and an extremely dense RGB encoded point cloud can be extracted. Overlapping images provide a series of stereopairs that can be used to create point cloud data consisting of 3 position and 3 color variables, X, Y, Z, R, G, and B. This point cloud is then used to create orthophotos or large scale digital elevation models, thus accurately displaying ice structure. The geo-referenced images provide a ground spatial resolution of approximately 6 cm, permitting analysis of detailed features, such as cryoconite holes, evolving small order streams, and cracks from hydrofracturing.",

            "abstract": "Water scarcity threatens ecosystems and human health and hampers economic development. It generally depends on the ratio of water consumption to availability. We calculated global, spatially explicit water stress indices (WSIs) which describe the vulnerability to additional water consumption on a scale from 0 (low) to 1 (high) and compare them for the decades 1981-1990 and 2001-2010. Input data are obtained from a multi-model ensemble at a resolution of 0.5 degrees. The variability among the models was used to run 1000 Monte Carlo simulations (latin hypercube sampling) and to subsequently estimate uncertainties of the WSIs. Globally, a trend of increasing water scarcity can be observed, however, uncertainties are large. The probability that this trend is actually occurring is as low as 53%. The increase in WSIs is rather driven by higher water use than lower water availability. Water availability is only 40% likely to decrease whereas water consumption is 67% likely to increase. Independent from the trend, we are already living under water scarce conditions, which is reflected in a consumption-weighted average of monthly WSIs of 0.51 in the recent decade. Its coefficient of variation points with 0.8 to the high uncertainties entailed, which might still hide poor model performance where all models consistently over- or underestimate water availability or use. Especially in arid areas, models generally overestimate availability.\nAlthough we do not traverse the planetary boundary of freshwater use as global water availability is sufficient, local water scarcity might be high. Therefore the regionalized assessment of WSIs under uncertainty helps to focus on specific regions to optimise water consumption. These global results can also help to raise awareness of water scarcity, and to suggest relevant measures such as more water efficient technologies to international companies, which have to deal with complex and distributed supply chains (e.g. in food production).",

            "abstract": "We discuss a method to retrieve the multi-receiver Moho reflection response by interferometry from SH-wave coda in the 0.5-3 Hz frequency range. An image derived from a reflection response with a well defined virtual source would provide deterministic impedance contrasts, which can complement transmission tomography. For an accurate retrieval, cross-correlation interferometry requires the coda wave field to sample the imaging target and isotropically illuminate the receiver array. When these illumination requirements are not or only partially met, the stationary phase cannot be fully captured and artifacts will contaminate the retrieved reflection response. Here we conduct numerical scalar 2D finite difference simulations to investigate the challenging situation in which only shallow crustal earthquake sources illuminate the Moho and the response is recorded by a 2D linear array. We quantify to what extent the prevalence of scatterers in the crust can improve the illumination conditions and thus the retrieval of the Moho reflection. The accuracy of the retrieved reflection is evaluated for two physically different scattering regimes: the Rayleigh and Mie regime. We only use the earlier part of the scattering coda, because we have found that the later diffusive part does not significantly improve the retrieval. The density of the spherical scatterers is varied in order to change the scattering mean free path. This characteristic length scale is calculated for each model with the 2D radiative transfer equation, which is the governing equation in the earlier part of the scattering coda. The experiment is repeated for models of different geological settings derived from existing S-wave tomographies, which vary in Moho depth and reflectivity. The scattering mean free path can be approximated for real data if intrinsic attenuation is known, because the wavenumber-dependent scattering attenuation of the coherent wave amplitude is dependent on the scattering mean free path. This link makes it possible to determine in which spatial and temporal bandwidth retrieval is most optimal for a specific geological setting.",

            "abstract": "In 2016, the InSight mission will provide the very first seismic records from Mars after installing a seismometer on the surface of the Red Planet. Obtaining information on the deep 1-D seismic structure of Mars using a single geophysical station will be challenging. However, successful test inversions using body and surface waves have been presented in a preliminary study by Panning et al. (2015). Future investigations need now to focus on inversions making a complete use of the seismic waveform. An important challenge is to investigate the effects of 3-D lateral variations of seismic velocity structures on seismograms. The HOPT (Higher Order Perturbation Theory) code originally developed by P. Lognonné and E. Clévédé (Lognonné, 1991 ; Lognonné and Clévédé, 2002) and based on the perturbation theory allows for the computation of synthetic seismograms in a 3-D Earth. We adapted the code for Mars and computed surface wave synthetics in a 3-D planet, initially only considering the effects of the planet's ellipticity as well as the lateral variations in the depth of the Moho which are known through gravity measurements (e.g. Neumann et al., 2004). Additional constraints from lateral variations in topography will be the focus of future work. These synthetics can be compared to future seismic data in order to identify a suite of Martian internal structure models that best match the data. To do so, we first need to estimate the resolvable parameters concerning the Mars deep interior while considering the 3-D effects, which is the main goal of this study. Furthermore, in preparation for the InSight mission data return phase, the computation of these synthetic (but realistic) seismograms is primordial to test the softwares developed by the InSight Mars Quake and Mars Structure Services (in charge of locating the seismic events, and using them to assess the internal structure of Mars).

            "abstract": "The introduction impervious surfaces in urban areas is a key driver of hydrologic change. It is now well understood that the amount of “effective” impervious area directly connected to the storm sewer network is a better indicator of hydrologic behavior than the total amount of impervious area. Most studies in urban hydrology have focused on the relationship between impervious connectivity and stormwater runoff or other surface water flows, with the result that the effect on subsurface flow is not as well understood. In the field, we observe differences in soil moisture availability that are dependent on proximity to impervious features and significant from a root water uptake perspective, which indicates that parcel-scale subsurface and plant water fluxes may also be sensitive to fine-scaled heterogeneity in impervious surface arrangement and connectivity. We use ParFlow with CLM, a watershed model with fully integrated variably-saturated subsurface flow, overland flow, and land-surface processes, to explore the extent to which soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and deep drainage vary under various impervious surface arrangement and soil condition scenarios, as well as under a range of precipitation regimes. We investigate the effect of several impervious surface and soil characteristics, including general lot layout, downspout disconnect, and direction of driveway/sidewalk slope, and soil compaction. We show that that some impervious connectivity schemes transfer more water from impervious areas to pervious ones and promote localized recharge by developing well-defined, fast-moving wetting fronts that are able to penetrate the root zone. Enhanced infiltration is translated more directly to recharge in normal to wet years but partitioned more often to transpiration in dry years, leading to a nonlinear relationship among precipitation, runoff and recharge.",

Surging glacier is a surge-type glacier in the active phase, flowing rapidly and transporting ice masses into the down-glaciers. The WKS is located in northwestern Tibetan Plateau (TP) and is one of the driest and the coldest place around TP. Accumulation and ablation mostly occur in summer season from May to August [Zhang et al., 1989; Maussion et al., 2014]. Zhang et al. (1989) estimated the annual average precipitation and temperature near the equilibrium line altitude (5930 m) is 300 mm and -13.9 deg. C, respectively. Under this sub-polar environment, polythermal glaciers exist in the WKS [Aniya, 2008]. We detected development of two surging flow with unprecedented temporal resolution up to 11 days. The two surging initiated around 2000 and continued by 2015. Surging flow accelerated at least 200 m/year. Moreover, it seasonally fluctuated their flow speed up to 200% in early winter against those in spring to early summer. The observed seasonal modulation in the surface velocities strongly suggests the presence of surface meltwater and subsequent rerouting through englacial and subglacial drainage system under a years-long surging glacier in the sub-polar environment.",

It has been suggested that unusual space weathering or possibly adsorbed water may be the cause of that brightening. In this paper, we examine the solar wind plasma inflow into the crater using LRO LOLA topography and plasma expansion formalism, and show that plasma flux to the surface is far lower than in topside regions directly exposed to the solar wind flow. The lack of plasma along the crater floor is expected to reduce space weathering of the regolith. Ironically, the lack of plasma also reduces sputtering allowing any adsorbed water/frost to persist for longer times relative to topside regions. We will thus consider how the reduced plasma inflow affects water and other volatiles that reside on the crater floor.",

The modeling of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) over Ganga Basin, especially its variability, is very crucial as most of the agro-economical practices depend on it. The monsoon rainfall over the core monsoon zone in India which covers the large amount of area of Ganga basin is significantly correlated with the rainfall over Ganga basin. Therefore, the atmospheric moisture transport from different terrestrial sources to the sink over Ganga basin is studied for better understanding of ISMR variability (both inter–annual, and intraseasonal timescale) over Ganga Basin and core monsoon zone. We use extended version of the dynamic recycling model, which is based on Lagrangian trajectory approach to study the impact of moisture source variability on ISMR over Ganga basin during 1979–2013. The intraseasonal variation of ISMR is also observed to be significantly associated with the moisture source variability. The regions with dense vegetation cover such as Ganga basin and south-central forest region in India, manifest substantial role of land surface feedback with high recycling ratios (15-20%). It is also observed that the peak monsoon rainfall occurs during a period when all the oceanic and terrestrial sources altogether contribute significantly to the ISMR. The novelty of present work lies in understanding the role of different terrestrial sources on ISMR variability at different timescale viz., intra–seasonal to interannual. Our findings also highlight the importance of land surface feedback through evapotranspiration, in order to accurately model ISMR variability for better planning and management of the crop calendar.\nKey words: Atmospheric moisture transport, Dynamic precipitation recycling, Indian summer monsoon rainfall variability, Ganga River Basin.",

The striking recurrence pattern can be explained by the successive occurrence of slow and fast slip events that trigger LFEs, but the source characteristics of the LFEs are still poorly understood. In particular, the decadal seismic record indicates that tremor bursts containing more LFEs and lasting longer are also associated with lower-amplitude ground motion. Here, we use numerical models of rupture dynamics to investigate the physics of micro-asperities under rapid loading to explain the source characteristics of the Parkfield LFEs. We find that the peak velocity of the slip event controls the number of LFEs per burst. However, the duration of the underlying slip does not directly control the duration of the tremor burst. This implies that the LFEs are triggered and take place shortly after the slip events, in a manner similar to mainshock/aftershocks interactions. Our results bring a better understanding of the physics of triggered tectonic tremors associated with underlying slow-slip events.",

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing of sea ice thickness can be achieved by different sensors that are based on independent physical retrieval methods. Consequently, these methods differ in sensitivity for certain sea ice types and thickness ranges as well as in the spatial and temporal resolution of the geophysical product. However, estimating Arctic sea ice volume requires retrieval methods that are able to obtain thickness information across the entire sea ice thickness range. Currently, this requirement is only met by laser altimeter and radar data, such as from ICESat or CryoSat-2. Other retrieval strategies that are realized by the evaluation of surface emissivity in microwave frequencies are restricted to the thin first-year sea ice thickness range, where the upper thickness threshold is defined by the wavelength among other factors. It is however the thin thickness ranges, where altimeter-based sea ice thickness estimates show the highest relative uncertainty, since the method requires a detectable elevation of ice floes above the local sea surface.\nWe show first result of a data fusion of sea ice thickness fields obtained from CryoSat-2 freeboard and L-Band surface emission measurements of the SMOS satellite. We implemented the data fusion with an optimal interpolation between the two datasets on a weekly basis, where the parameters of the optimal interpolation are based on the sensor characteristics and the uncertainties of the sea ice thickness data fields from both sources. The differences of both data products are used to discuss the potential preferential sampling in both datasets. In addition, we use dedicated airborne and shipborne validation data in the marginal ice zone in the Barents Sea to assess the characteristics the individual and merged sea ice thickness information.",

            "abstract": "This paper quantifies, for the first time, the surface morphology and subsurface structure of deposits in the tidally-influenced fluvial zone (TIFZ) of the Columbia River, NW USA. Channel and bed morphology are quantified using multi-beam echosounding, with the subsurface sedimentology revealed using Ground Penetrating Radar and a Parametric Echosounder, combined with shallow (< 5m) cores.\nData from the landward, fluvially-dominated, tidally-altered region is characterised by medium-scale dune deposits that are indistinguishable from those of purely fluvial origin. The central minimum “energy flux divergence” (EFD) region displays a highly complex structure. This comprises classic signatures associated with the turbidity maximum that occur away from the main channel in distributaries, backwater bays, tidal creeks and bar remnants (e.g. increased proportion of silt, and prevalence of long, low-angle lateral accretion surfaces associated with fine deposition on point bars; Inclined Heterolithic Stratification). However, closer to the main channel in the landward section of the minimum EFD region an anabranching planform dominates and bar vertical grain size trends display a coarse-fine-coarse succession. These bars are characterised by coarser-grained dune deposits at their base, pervasive sand-silt in the central part of the bar with smaller sand dunes on the surface or steep bar margin sets in the bartails. The finer-grained part of this succession is interpreted as a subtle tidal influence on relatively stable bars with vertical accretion that undergoes reworking by wave action.\nIn the seaward part of the minimum EFD region, close to the main channel, long, low-angle surfaces predominate, although some steep bar margin and dune deposits are still present. Silts are found as laminae within sand deposits, and dunes in this zone are small, more symmetrical, or absent entirely.\nOverall, the sedimentology of the Columbia River TIFZ does not correspond well to other published models because of its relatively coarse grain size, anabranching planform, greater main channel flow velocities and entrenched fluvial/deltaic environment. More typical TIFZ facies described in the literature are largely restricted to embayments and in the very seaward part of the minimum EFD region.",

            "abstract": "Tests of the interactions between tectonic and climate forcing on Earth’s topography often focus on the concept of steady-state whereby processes of rock deformation and erosion are opposing and equal. However, when conditions change such as the climate or tectonic rock uplift, then surface processes act to restore the balance between rock deformation and erosion by adjusting topography. Most examples of canonical steady-state mountain ranges lie within the northern hemisphere, which underwent a radical change in the Quaternary due to the onset of widespread glaciation. The activity of glaciers changed erosion rates and topography in many of these mountain ranges, which likely violates steady-state assumptions.\nWith new topographic analysis, and existing patterns of climate and rock uplift, we explore a mountain range previously considered to be in steady-state, the Olympic Mountains, USA. The broad spatial trend in channel steepness values suggests that the locus of high rock uplift rates is coincident with the rugged range core, in a similar position as high temperature and pressure lithologies, but not in the low lying foothills as has been previously suggested by low-temperature thermochronometry. The details of our analysis suggest the dominant topographic signal in the Olympic Mountains is a spatial, and likely temporal, variation in erosional efficiency dictated by orographic precipitation, and Pleistocene glacier ELA patterns. We demonstrate the same topographic effects are recorded in the basin hypsometries of other Cenozoic mountain ranges around the world. The significant glacial overprint on topography makes the argument of mountain range steadiness untenable in significantly glaciated settings. Furthermore, our results suggest that most glaciated Cenozoic ranges are likely still in a mode of readjustment as fluvial systems change topography and erosion rates to equilibrate with rock uplift rates.",

More robust estimates of global GPP could be obtained from the atmospheric budgets of other valuable tracers, such as carbonyl sulfide (COS) or the oxygen isotopic composition (δ18O) of atmospheric CO2. However, quantifying GPP using these tracers hinges on a better understanding of how soil micro-organisms modify the atmospheric concentrations of CO18O and COS at large scales. In particular, understanding better the role and activity of the enzyme Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) in soil micro-organisms is critical.

            "abstract": "Variability in streamwater sulfate concentrations at Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), a small 41-hectare forested watershed near Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A., was assessed for the period 1996–2012. The source of sulfate at PMRW is predominantly atmospheric deposition of which about 85% is retained within the watershed. Sulfate concentrations increase with increasing streamflow due to an increasing contribution of soil water, which has higher concentrations than that of groundwater. Sulfate concentrations also increased when an intermittent stream in the upper part of the watershed with higher sulfate concentrations contributed larger portions to total streamflow. The highest streamwater sulfate concentrations were observed in hydrologic events that occurred during periods of wetting up after long periods of drought, which were most evident during July through December. These high sulfate concentrations presumably are the result of desorption of sulfate from the shallow soils that accumulated during droughts. Simple concentration-discharge models were fairly weak, with a model R2 of about 0.35, but improved to an R2 of about 0.4 when adding the ratio of streamflow between the upper part of the watershed and the outlet as an independent variable. Additional model improvements were attempted by separating the samples into various groups based on: (1) time of year that high sulfate values were observed; (2) current drought conditions, and; (3) drought conditions during the previous growing season. The largest improvements occurred when separate models were made based on the drought conditions during the previous growing season with model R2s ranging from 0.43 to 0.67 and improvement was observed across all prior drought conditions. The use of hydrologic and climatic variables and categorization led to an enhanced understanding of the factors that affect water-quality variability, and can strengthen predictions of concentrations and estimates of loads.",

            "abstract": "Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is the core of any operational weather service. The horizontal and vertical resolution of numerical weather prediction models strongly increased during the last decades. However, numerical weather prediction in complex terrain is still challenging, because the underlying physics in the majority of subgrid-scale parameterizations have been developed for flat or idealized terrain. Weather prediction in alpine countries – such as Austria or Switzerland – is not only challenged by complex topography, furthermore, for a good part of the year the ground is snow covered influencing boundary layer processes such as turbulence and radiation. Currently, most NWP models predict the formation and evolution of the seasonal mountain snow cover in a simplified way, i.e. often a single layer model. We validated the performance of the currently implemented snow cover scheme of the COSMO model (Consortium for Small-scale Modelling) in terms of the snow surface temperature, a key parameter for the evolution of the snow cover, as well as snow height. Snow surface temperature and snow height from 120 alpine weather stations located across the Swiss Alps were compared to the corresponding COSMO output. Surface temperature was found to be overestimated especially during the night (up to 10 °C, RMSE = 6.0 °C). Snow height tends to be underestimated during the ablation phase, i.e. the COSMO model becomes snow-free too early. A new multi-layer snow module, which minimizes the energy balance equation with regard to snow surface temperature and then iteratively solves the heat equation has been implemented, predicting the daily cycle of the snow surface temperature accurately (RMSE = 1.8 °C). Furthermore, by implementing densification, melt-freeze processes and water transport snow height, especially during the ablation phase, was found to be in good agreement with the observations. Our suggested snow scheme shows promising potential not only for accurately modeled snow surface temperature and snow height it has also the potential to improve the NWP performance, e.g. in predicting the near surface air temperature during snow covered periods.",

These records are di\u000efficult to interpret, however, since they document combined eff ects of deep-sea temperature and ice volume variations. Information on CO2 is expanding, but remains highly uncertain and intermittent. Attempts to determine the long-term relations between \u000eδ18O, sea level and CO2 from proxy data su ffer from paucity of data and apparent inconsistency among di fferent records. One outstanding issue is the di fference recorded in proxy CO2 data between the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (EOT) and the Middle-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), while similar levels of benthic \u000eδ18O are shown during these time periods. Here, we take a model-based approach to deconvolute the benthic \u000eδ18O signal, and reconcile knowledge on benthic δ\u000e18O, sea level, CO2 and temperature. We obtain continuous and mutually consistent 38-Myr-long simulations of these variables, by forcing a coupled ice sheet-climate model inversely with benthic \u000eδ18O observations. We show that different CO2 between the EOT and MMCO, as indicated by proxy data, can only be obtained if we impose erosion or tectonic movement of the Antarctic continent over time.",

            "abstract": "The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has developed a National Hydrologic Model (NHM) to support coordinated, comprehensive and consistent hydrologic model development, and facilitate the application of hydrologic simulations within the conterminous United States (CONUS). More than 1,700 gaged watersheds across the CONUS were modeled to test the feasibility of improving streamflow simulations in gaged and ungaged watersheds by linking statistically- and physically-based hydrologic models with remotely-sensed data products (i.e. – snow water equivalent) and estimates of uncertainty. Initially, the physically-based models were calibrated to measured streamflow data to provide a baseline for comparison. As many stream reaches in the CONUS are either not gaged, or are substantially impacted by water use or flow regulation, ancillary information must be used to determine reasonable parameter estimations for streamflow simulations. In addition, not all ancillary datasets are appropriate for application to all parts of the CONUS (e.g. - snow water equivalent in the southeastern U.S., where snow is a rarity). As it is not expected that any one data product or model simulation will be sufficient for representing hydrologic behavior across the entire CONUS, a systematic evaluation of which data products improve simulations of streamflow for various regions across the CONUS was performed. The resulting portfolio of calibration strategies can be used to guide selection of an appropriate combination of simulated and measured information for model development and calibration at a given location of interest. In addition, these calibration strategies have been developed to be flexible so that new data products or simulated information can be assimilated. This analysis provides a foundation to understand how well models work when streamflow data is either not available or is limited and could be used to further inform hydrologic model parameter development for ungaged areas.",

In our analysis we use earthquakes of magnitude (mb) > 3, recorded between 2001 and 2014, by the Northeast Telemetered Network. Our analysis is done as a two-step process: (a) estimation of the moment magnitude (Mw) of the earthquake by fitting the P-wave source spectra using a circular fault model; and (b) linear regression to the distribution of frequency of earthquakes within given ranges of moment magnitude using the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. The magnitude of completeness for the set of earthquakes used in our study was found to be (Mw) 4. Accordingly, the range of earthquake magnitude was chosen to be in increments of 0.5 between (Mw) 4.0 and 6.0. We study the b-value for both interval and cumulative frequency of earthquakes. Our estimated b-value for the entire dataset is 0.54 and 0.77, respectively. We observe a distinctive variation in the b-value for plate boundary and intra-plate earthquakes. We sub-divided the region in three zones and estimated the b-values: (i) Eastern-Himalayan zone with b-values of 0.46 (interval) and 0.71 (cumulative); (ii) Indo-Burma convergence zone with b-values of 0.30 (interval) and 0.58 (cumulative); and (iii) northeastern India (including the Shillong Plateau and Bengal Basin) with b-values of 0.31 (interval) and 0.59 (cumulative). The global average b-value is known to be ~1. b-values lower than the global average indicate that the cumulative energy released by earthquakes is lower than the accumulated energy through plate convergence. This can also be empirically related to stress accumulation in a region. Using this understanding, we infer that the intra-plate region of northeast India and the Indo-Burman plate boundary is accumulating elastic strain to be released in future large earthquakes. We also explore possible relationship between b-value and earthquake stress drop as a function of depth.",

Unlike other radiogenic isotope heterogeneities observed in oceanic basalts, largely controlled by incorporation of recycled crustal materials, it seems likely that the observed range of Os-isotope compositions in oceanic peridotites directly reflect varying degrees of ancient melt extraction from peridotitic mantle. Hence, global variations of Os-isotope compositions in oceanic peridotites may provide an important piece of information in unraveling the geochemical and geodynamic evolution of the convecting mantle. Here we present the Os-isotope variations in peridotite-serpentinite recovered from the Pacific area because the number of data available is yet scarce when compared with data from other oceans (Atlantic, Arctic and Indian Ocean). Our primary purpose is to test whether mantle domains underlying four major oceans are distinct in terms of Os isotope variations, reflecting the pattern of mantle convection or mixing efficiency. We examined 187Os/188Os ratios and highly siderophile element concentrations in serpentinized harzburgite recovered from Hess Deep in the East Pacific Rise, a mantle section in the Taitao ophiolite, Chile (Schulte et al., 2009), serpentinized harzburgite bodies in the Izu-Ogasawara and Tonga forearc (Parkinson et al., 1998), peridotite xenoliths from the Pali-Kaau vent in O'ahu island, Hawaii (Bizimis et al., 2007), and low-temperature type peridotite xenoliths from Malaita, Solomon Islands (Ishikawa et al., 2011). The results demonstrate that samples from each area display very similar Os-isotope variations with a pronounced peak in 187Os/188Os = 0.125-0.128. Moreover, the relatively larger datasets obtained from Hess Deep, Taitao and Malaita clearly exhibit the presence of secondary peak in 187Os/188Os=0.117-0.119 (Re-depletion ages ~1.5 Ga). These characteristics are almost identical to the global population mainly comprised of data from other oceans. This suggests that small-scale heterogeneities created by ancient melt extraction are homogeneously distributed over large scales within the convecting mantle.",

            "abstract": "The hillslope scale is an important transition between the field scale and the catchment scale. The water flow in the unsaturated zone of a hillslope can be highly dynamic, which can lead to dynamic changes of groundwater flow or stream outflow. Additionally, interactions among host rock formation, soil properties and recharge water from precipitation or anthropogenic activities (mining, agriculture etc.) can influence the water quality of groundwater and stream in the long term. To simulate reactive transport processes at such a scale is a challenging task. On the one hand, simulation of water flow in a coupled soil-aquifer system often involves solving of highly non-linear PDEs such as Richards equation; on the other hand, one has to consider complicated biogeochemical reactions (e.g. water-rock interactions, biological degradation, redox reactions). Both aspects are computationally expensive and have high requirements on the numerical precision and stabilities of the employed code.\nThe primary goals of this study are as follows: i) Identify the bottlenecks and quantitatively analyse their influence on simulation of biogeochemical reactions at a hillslope scale; ii) find or suggest practical strategies to deal with these bottlenecks, thus to provide detailed hints for future improvements of reactive transport simulators. To achieve these goals, the parallelized reactive transport simulator OGS#IPhreeqc has been applied to simulate two benchmark examples. The first example is about uranium leaching based on Šimůnek et al. (2012), which considers the leaching of uranium from a mill tailing and accompanied mineral dissolution/precipitation. The geochemical system is then extended to include redox reactions in the second example. Based on these examples, the numerical stability and parallel performance of the tool is analysed.\n",

            "abstract": "Distance-related errors complicate the resolution of real-time ambiguity in medium–long baseline marine surveys. Therefore, detection and recovery of cycle slips in real time is required to ensure high accuracy of global navigation satellite system positioning and navigation in marine surveys. To resolve this, an improved method was presented, where linear combinations of the triple-differenced (TD) between carriers L1 and L2 were formed for a wide lane and free ionosphere. To overcome severe ill-conditioned problems of the normal equation, the Tikhonov regularization method was used. We suggested the construction of a regularized matrix by combining a priori information of known coordinates of reference stations, followed by the determination of the corresponding regularized parameter. A float solution was calculated for the TD ambiguity. The search cycle slip (TD integer ambiguity) was obtained using the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) method. Using our method, cycle slips of several reference station-baselines with lengths of a few hundred to one thousand kilometers were detected in real-time. The results were consistent with professional software , with a success rate of 100%.",

            "abstract": "Topography exerts critical controls on many hydrologic, geomorphologic, and environmental biophysical processes. Unfortunately many watershed modeling systems use topography only to define basin boundaries and stream channels and do not explicitly account for the topographic controls on processes such as soil genesis, soil moisture distributions and hydrological response. We develop and demonstrate a method that uses topography to spatially adjust soil morphological and soil hydrological attributes [soil texture, depth to the C-horizon, saturated conductivity, bulk density, porosity, and the field capacities at 33kpa (~ field capacity) and 1500kpa (~ wilting point) tensions]. In order to test the performance of the method the topographical adjusted soils and standard SSURGO soil (available at 1:20,000 scale) were overlaid on soil pedon pit data in the Grasslands Soil and Water Research Lab in Resiel, TX. The topographically adjusted soils exhibited significant correlations with measurements from the soil pits, while the SSURGO soil data showed almost no correlation to measured data. We also applied the method to the Grasslands Soil and Water Research watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to 15 separate fields as a proxy to propagate changes in soil properties into field scale hydrological responses. Results of this test showed that the topographically adjusted soils resulted better model predictions of field runoff in 50% of the field, with the SSURGO soils preforming better in the remainder of the fields. However, the topographically adjusted soils generally predicted baseflow response more accurately, reflecting the influence of these soil properties on non-storm responses. These results indicate that adjusting soil properties based on topography can result in more accurate soil characterization and, in some cases improve model performance.",

            "abstract": "Among the experiments which explore the martian soil aboard the Curiosity Rover, SAM experiment is mainly dedicated to the search for indigenous organic compounds. To reach its goals SAM can operate in different analysis modes: Pyrolysis-GC-MS and Pyrolysis-MS (EGA). In addition SAM includes wet chemistry experiments [1] to supports extraction of polar organic compounds from solid samples that improves their detection either by increasing the release of chemical species from solid sample matrices, or by changing their chemical structure to make compounds more amenable to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). The two wet chemistry experimental capabilities of SAM provide alternatives to the nominal inert-thermal desorption/pyrolysis analytical protocol and are more aptly suited for polar components: MTBSTFA derivatization [2-3] and TMAH thermochemolysis [4-5]. Here we focus on the MTBSTFA derivatization experiment.\nIn order to build a support used to help the interpretation of SAM results, we have investigated the artifacts and backgrounds sources generated by the all analysis process: Solid sample were heated up to approximately 840°C at a rate of 35°C/min under He flow. For GC analyses, the majority of the gas released was trapped on a hydrocarbon trap (Tenax®) over a specific temperature range. Adsorbed volatiles on the GC injection trap (IT) were then released into the GC column (CLP-MXT 30m x 0.25mm x 0.25µm) by rapidly heating the IT to 300°C. Then, in order better understand the part of compounds detected coming from internal reaction we have performed several lab experiments to mimic the SAM device: Among the sources of artifact, we test: (1) the thermal stability and the organic material released during the degradation of Tenax® and carbosieve, (2) the impact of MTBSTFA and a mixture of DMF and MTBSTFA on the adsorbent, (3) the reaction between the different adsorbents (Tenax® and Carbosieve) and calcium perchlorate and then (4) the sources and molecules that may constitute organic material precursors sources.

            "abstract": "Typical petrophysical well log correlation is accomplished by manual pattern recognition leading to subjective correlations. The change in character in a well log is dependent upon the change in the response of the tool to lithology. The petrophysical interpreter looks for a change in one log type that would correspond to the way a different tool responds to the same lithology. To develop an objective way to pick changes in well log characteristics, we adapt a method of first arrival picking used in seismic data to analyze changes in the character of well logs. We chose to use the fractal method developed by Boschetti et al\n[1]\n(1996). This method worked better than we expected and we found similar changes in the fractal dimension across very different tool types (sonic vs density vs gamma ray). We reason the fractal response of the log is not dependent on the physics of the tool response but rather the change in the complexity of the log data. When a formation changes physical character in time or space the recorded magnitude in tool data changes complexity at the same time even if the original tool response is very different. The relative complexity of the data regardless of the tool used is dependent upon the complexity of the medium relative to tool measurement. The relative complexity of the recorded magnitude data changes as a tool transitions from one character type to another. The character we are measuring is the roughness or complexity of the petrophysical curve. Our method provides a way to directly compare different log types based on a quantitative change in signal complexity. For example, using changes in data complexity allow us to correlate gamma ray suites with sonic logs within a well and then across to an adjacent well with similar signatures. Our method creates reliable and automatic correlations to be made in data sets beyond the reasonable cognitive limits of geoscientists in both speed and consistent pattern recognition.\n\n[1] Fabio Boschetti, Mike D.

A GMV-led consortium is operating the Copernicus POD Service being in charge of generating precise orbital products and auxiliary data files for their use as part of the processing chains of the respective Sentinel PDGS.\nThe Sentinel-1, -2 & -3 missions have different but very demanding requirements in terms of orbital accuracy and timeliness. Orbital products in Near Real Time (latency: 30 min), Short Time Critical (1.5 days) and Non-time Critical (20-30 days) are required. The accuracy requirements are very challenging, targeting 5 cm in 3D for Sentinel-1 and 2-3 cm in radial direction for Sentinel-3.\nSentinel-3A carries, in addition to a GPS receiver a laser retro reflector and a DORIS receiver. On the one hand, the three different techniques GPS, SLR and DORIS make POD more complex but, on the other hand, it is very helpful to have independent techniques available for validation of the orbit results. The successful POD processing for Sentinel-1A is a good preparation for Sentinel-3A due to the similar demanding orbit accuracy requirements. The Copernicus POD Service is ready for Sentinel-3A and the service will process GPS and SLR data routinely and has the capacity to process DORIS in NTC and reprocessing campaigns. The three independent orbit determination techniques on Sentinel-3 offer big potential for scientific exploitation. Carrying all three techniques together makes the satellite, e.g., very useful for combining all the techniques on observation level as it could only be done for Jason-2 until now.\nThe Sentinel POD Quality Working Group strongly supporting the CPOD Service delivers additional orbit solutions to validate the CPOD results independently. The recommendations from this body guarantee that the CPOD Service is updated following state-of-the-art algorithms, models and conventions. The QWG also focuses on the scientific exploitation of the Sentinel missions.\nThe current status of the CPOD Service is presented operating Sentinel-1A and -2A and its readiness for Sentinel-3A. It is shown how the quality and the timeliness of the products are guaranteed. Possibilities for scientific exploitation of the Sentinel-3 mission also in synergy with other Earth Observation and Sentinel missions are presented.",

            "abstract": "Indonesia is situated at the southern margin of SE Asia, which comprises an assemblage of Gondwana-derived continental terranes, suture zones and volcanic arcs. The formation of SE Asia is believed to have started in Early Devonian. Its complex history involves the opening and closure of three distinct Tethys oceans, each accompanied by the rifting of continental fragments. We apply the receiver function technique to data of the temporary MERAMEX network operated in Central Java from May to October 2004 by the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam. The network consisted of 112 mobile stations with a spacing of about 10 km covering the full width of the island between the southern and northern coast lines. The tectonic history is reflected in a complex crustal structure of Central Java exhibiting strong topography of the Moho discontinuity related to different tectonic units. A discontinuity of negative impedance contrast is observed throughout the mid-crust interpreted as the top of a low-velocity layer which shows no depth correlation with the Moho interface. Converted phases generated at greater depth beneath Indonesia indicate the existence of multiple seismic discontinuities within the upper mantle and even below. The strongest signal originates from the base of the mantle transition zone, i.e. the 660 km discontinuity. The phase related to the 410 km discontinuity is less pronounced, but clearly identifiable as well. The derived thickness of the mantle-transition zone is in good agreement with the IASP91 velocity model. Additional phases are observed at roughly 33 s and 90 s relative to the P onset, corresponding to about 300 km and 920 km, respectively. A signal of reversed polarity indicates the top of a low velocity layer at about 370 km depth overlying the mantle transition zone.",

            "abstract": "With the prospects of instruments to observe rotational ground motions in a wide frequency and amplitude range in the near future we engage in the question how this type of ground motion observation can be used to solve seismic inverse problems. Here, we focus on the question, whether point or finite source inversions can benefit from additional observations of rotational motions. In an attempt to be fair we compare observations from a surface seismic network with N 3-component translational sensors (classic seismometers) with those obtained with N/2 6-component sensors (with additional colocated 3-component rotational motions). Thus we keep the overall number of traces constant. Synthetic seismograms are calculated for known point- or finite-source properties. The corresponding inverse problem is posed in a probabilistic way using the Shannon information content as a measure how the observations constrain the seismic source properties. The results show that with the 6-C subnetworks the source properties are not only equally well recovered (even that would be benefitial because of the substantially reduced logistics installing N/2 sensors) but statistically significant some source properties are almost always better resolved. We assume that this can be attributed to the fact the (in particular vertical) gradient information is contained in the additional rotational motion components. We compare these effects for strike-slip and normal-faulting type sources. Thus the answer to the question raised is a definite “yes”. The challenge now is to demonstrate these effects on real data.",

            "abstract": "Laser scanning technology (lidar) has the ability to capture three-dimensional structural information from forests. This study aimed at assessing forest structure and dynamics of logged and unlogged forests on a ranch in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon (Paragominas Municipality, Pará State) using high resolution (1 m) lidar derived data acquired in 2012 and 2014. We used the 2012 coverage (including areas logged between 2007 and 2010) to estimate canopy and ground damage: canopy gaps (defined as contiguous areas > 10 m², with height < 10 m) were mapped from a canopy height model (CHM) and ground damage was mapped using a relative density metric that calculates the proportion of returns at understory level versus total returns. Additionally, we used 2012 and 2014 coverages (including areas logged between 2007 and 2013) to identify areas of height loss by comparing the CHM from both dates. Forest turnover and gap formation was greater in areas logged between the two acquisition dates (10.4 gaps/ha and 893m² of gaps/ha). Older logged areas (2007 to 2010) presented intermediate values (9.89 gaps/ha and 346m² of gaps/ha), while unlogged areas showed the smallest values (7.10 gaps/ha and 270m² of gaps/ha). The greater amount of gaps in the older logged compared to the unlogged forests suggests that there is an increased tree mortality associated to the post-logging period. We found significant differences in the number of canopy gaps between undisturbed and logged forests (p-value<0.001), but not among logging dates (p-value>0.428). In contrast, we observed differences at the understory level among the logged areas (p-value<0.015), and no difference between unlogged forests and areas logged in 2007 (p-value>0.765). Our findings suggest that canopy damage lasts longer than ground damage, and therefore, add relevant information for long-term degradation assessments.",

            "abstract": "The concept of long-term lithological strength and its spatial variations is an issue of much debate. Despite huge efforts, a consensus among researchers remains elusive. Part of the reason for this is that continuously varying strength is an impossible scenario in block models which only allow spatially non-varying strain rates within individual blocks. However, it is possible to impose and/or invert for variable coupling coefficients along mapped block boundaries. Such coupling coefficients can either come from direct observations of strength such as boreholes or from dynamic models that fit geodetic fields provided by GPS and/or INSAR observations. The tectonically active Eastern Mediterranean region poses important hazard-related questions such as the state of coupling along the Hellenic trench and deformation along the Cyprus arc are directly linked to the lateral strength distibution of the deforming areas to the north. In this study we explore two distinct block architectures for the eastern Mediterranean region: a complex block configuration as suggested by previous GPS studies with optimized block architecture (to best fit the geodetic velocity field) and another simple configuration based on a recent geological study that delineated blocks using geological features such as demarcated ophiolitic zones, known highly strained ductile shear zones etc. We then run a series of dynamical strength inversions assuming several different values of the ratios for the long-term pore-pressure to the lithostatic pressure and brittle-ductile transition depth. For each case we run checkerboard tests and finally analyze the ramifications in terms of the spatial distribution of the misfits and the state of coupling along the Hellenic Trench and Cyprus arcs.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric production rates of cosmogenic radionuclides, such as 14C and 10Be, vary globally due to external processes, namely the solar and geomagnetic modulation of the galactic cosmic ray flux as well as solar proton events. This signature is recorded in various archives such as ice cores (10Be) and tree-rings (14C). Hence, cosmogenic radionuclides offer a means to continuously assess timescale differences between two of the most widely used timescales in paleoclimatology – the radiocarbon and the ice core timescales. Short lived solar proton events additionally provide distinct marker horizons that allow synchronization of discrete horizons at annual precision.\nWe will present a cosmogenic radionuclide based synchronization of the Greenland ice core timescale (GICC05, Svensson et al., 2008) and the radiocarbon timescale (IntCal13, Reimer et al., 2013) over the Holocene. This synchronization allows radiocarbon dated and ice core paleoclimate records to be compared on a common timescale at down to sub-decadal precision. We will compare these results to independent discrete isochrones obtained from tephrochronology and solar proton events. In addition, we will discuss implications for the accuracy and uncertainty estimates of GICC05 over the Holocene.\nReimer, P. J., Bard, E., Bayliss, A., Beck, J. W., Blackwell, P.

The MFMSPL has a similar conceptual design with the way the physical model had been constructed and observes the angular-resolved depolarized lidar returns within the FOV comparable to satellite footprints (e.g. CALIPSO).

            "abstract": "Magmatic plumbing systems, particularly in continental arcs, have long been recognized as sites of open system processes. Disequilibrium textures or zoning in phenocrysts result if crystallization is coeval with assimilation or mixing. Radiometric dating measures a crystal’s age, but not necessarily the amount of time spent at magmatic temperatures, or its residence time in the melt in which it is erupted [1]. Indeed, the relative amount of time spent by melts vs. crystals in any particular crustal reservoir may be very different.\nAt Parinacota Volcano (central Andes), eruptions transitioned from tapping of a stagnant, silicic, crystal-rich mush to a more dynamic, mafic, crystal-poor magma over ca. 30 k.y., when recharge increased and mafic magmas transited the crust much faster [2]. Bulk lava chemistry and isotopic composition during initial stages of this transition (47-28 ka) indicate that the magmatic system was compartmentalized: one part evolved to more silicic compositions consistent with fractional crystallization, whereas the other became slightly more mafic by recharge. Despite heterogeneity of host melts erupted during this change in magmatic regime, the crystal cargoes in these magmas are homogenous in terms of mineral phases present, their major and trace element chemistry, age, and recorded P-T conditions and thus are likely to be derived from the same long-lived crystal-rich reservoir.\nIn contrast to the minerals, the bulk composition of lavas varied on timescales of hundreds to thousands of years – evidence that melts reside in the system relatively briefly. In contrast, U-Th dating indicates the crystal cargo is much older (up to 350 k.y.), especially in the case of zircon. Reconciling these two lines of evidence suggests that: (1) the same cohort of crystals remains in the magma reservoir for periods of time much longer than it takes to build a volcano, (2) the presence of any given melt is ephemeral, and (3) the capacity of melts to transport crystals to the surface is limited and varies with magma flux. At Parinacota, several k.y. of mafic recharge were still not sufficient to completely purge the persistent old crystals from the reservoir(s).\n[1] Cooper & Kent (2014) Nature 506, 480-483.

            "abstract": "Aircraft initiated or intercepted lightning is one of significant issues for civilian flight operation in Japan. It is much less possible than the past that lightning strikes cause fatal aircraft accidents thanks to both of certifications of aircraft design for lightning strikes and many of weather supports for aircraft operation. However, hundreds of lightning strikes to aircrafts have still been reported in each recent year in Japan, and airlines have been forced to delay or cancel most of those flights and to cost several hundred millions of yen for repair. Especially, lightning discharges during winter in the coastal area of the Sea of Japan frequently cause heavy damages on aircrafts due to their large charge transfer. It is important in actual aircraft operation that observed meteorological parameters are converted to decision-making information. Otherwise, pilots, controllers, or operators need to learn meteorology as much as weather experts, and to owe hard work load to interpret observed meteorological data to their risk. Ideally, it is desired to automatically provide them with predicted operation risk, for example, delay time, possibility of flight cancellation, and repair cost caused by lightning.\nOur research group has just started development of tactical lightning avoidance product, where a risk index of an aircraft operation due to lightning is calculated mainly from three novel observation devices: The phased array weather radar has potential to detect thunderstorms in their early stage due to the high volume scan rate of 10 – 30 sec. A lightning mapping system, such as Broadband Observation network for Lightning and Thunderstorm, indicates electrical structure inside clouds in concert with a co-located radar data. Aircraft sounding and real-time data downlink, especially high-frequency data provided by Secondary Surveillance Radar mode S, gives in-situ measurements of wind and temperature. Especially the in-situ temperature data can indicate altitudes of electrical charge separation. An integrated data processing method to output the tactical lightning avoidance product will be developed by analyzing data obtained in an observation campaign which will have been conducted until 2017. In the presentation, overview and progress of our research and development will be described.",

Decreasing the amount of hot water applied may make farmers reduce the operation cost. To determine the appropriate amount of hot water needed for soil disinfection, HYDRUS-2D was evaluated.\nA field experiment was conducted and soil water content and soil temperature were measured at 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 cm deep when 95oC hot water was applied. Irrigation tubing equipped with drippers every 30 cm were laid at the soil surface, z=0 cm. An irrigation rate for each dripper was 0.83 cm min-1 between t=0 and 120 min, and thereafter it was zero. Temperature of irrigation water was 95oC. Total simulation time with HYDRUS-2D was 720 min for a homogeneous soil. A simulating domain was selected as x=60 cm and z=100 cm. A potential evaporation rate was assumed to be 0 cm min-1 because the soil surface was covered with a plastic sheet. The boundary condition at the bottom was free drainage and those of both sides were no-flux conditions. Hydraulic properties and bulk densities measured at each depth were used for simulation. It was assumed that there was no organic matter contained. Soil thermal properties were adopted from previous study and HYDRUS 2D.\nSimulated temperatures at 5, 10, 20 and 40 cm deep agreed well with those measured although simulated temperatures at 60, 80, and 100 cm deep were overly estimated. Estimates of volumetric water content at 5 cm deep agreed well with measured values. Simulated values at 10 to 100 cm deep were overly estimated by 0.1 to 0.3 (m3 m-3). The deeper the soil became, the more the simulated wetting front lagged behind the measured one. It was speculated that water viscosity estimated smaller at high temperature might attributed to the slower advances of wetting front simulated with HYDRUS 2-D.",

            "abstract": "The position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has been hypothesized to play a role in linking the climate of the poles to the tropics and in predicating important changes in ocean overturning, particularly on deglacial timescales. One method of tracking the paleo-position of the ITCZ is through the quantification of 230Thxs,0-normalized 232Th concentrations in marine sediments which act as proxy for aeolian dust flux. Because the ITCZ is an efficient scavenger of atmospheric particulates, changes in the latitude of maximum dust flux can yield insight into variations in ITCZ position. This technique has been successfully utilized to reconstruct the movement of the ITCZ during the last deglaciation in the eastern equatorial Pacific (McGee et al., 2007). In this study we apply a similar approach to produce a high-resolution reconstruction of ITCZ movement in the central equatorial Pacific over the last 130 kyr, including the last glacial inception, Marine Isotope Stage 4, the Last Glacial Maximum and Termination I (TI).\nWe present records of 232Th/230Thxs,0 as a proxy for continentally sourced dust at sub-millennial resolution along a latitudinal transect of three sites beneath the shifting ITCZ. We pair our new data with existing dust flux data from Antarctica, Greenland and the North Pacific to differentiate between changes in the ITCZ and variability in atmospheric dust abundance. Our data reconstruct a spatially different pattern of ITCZ movement during the last two deglaciations, which allows us to locate our records in the context of recent studies challenging our mechanistic understanding of deglacial terminations. Additionally, our data show evidence of precessional forcing in reconstructed dust fluxes, and we evaluate changes in ITCZ precipitation intensity (scavenging efficiency) and enhanced aeolian transport in tropical dust source regions as the driver of this variability.\nD.

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean plays a fundamental role in the global ocean-climate system. Increasing temperatures in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current have been observed over recent decades, but as a result of sparse historical sampling, the onset of warming and mechanism(s) remain uncertain. Here we integrate ocean and atmospheric observations with climate-sensitive tree growth on subantarctic islands to produce a unique temperature record across 4˚ of latitude in the southwest Pacific. We demonstrate a dramatic increase in climate variability across the second half of the Twentieth Century that is unprecedented over the last 140 years (coincident with an order of magnitude decline in the populations of many marine species). Reanalysis and climate modelling suggests this increased variability is a result of increasing westerly wind strength and Southern Ocean warming. Projected increases in westerly wind strength are likely to continue to have significant impacts on biota. ",

            "abstract": "Interannual variations of latent heat fluxes (LHF) and sensible heat fluxes (SHF) over the Mediterranean for the boreal winter season (DJF) show positive trends during 1958-2011. Using a combination of reanalysis and satellite-based products, the variability and trends in the heat fluxes are compared with variations in three atmospheric teleconnection patterns: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the pressure and position of the Azores High (AH) and the East Atlantic-West Russia teleconnection pattern (EAWR). Comparison of correlations between the heat fluxes and teleconnections, along with analysis of composites of surface temperature, humidity and wind fields for different teleconnection states demonstrates that variations of the AH are found to explain the heat flux changes more successfully than the NAO and the EAWR. Trends in sea level pressure and longitude of the Azores High during DJF show a strengthening, and an eastward shift. DJF Azores High pressure and longitude are shown to co-vary such that variability of the Azores High occurs along an axis defined by lower pressure and westward location at one extreme, and higher pressure and eastward location at the other extreme. The shift of the Azores High from predominance of the low/west state to the high/east state induces trends in Mediterranean Sea surface winds, temperature and moisture. These, combined with sea surface warming trends, produce trends in wintertime Mediterranean Sea sensible and latent heat fluxes.",

The National Research Council hosted a Convocation in May 2015 on this very topic, inspired by the 2012 PCAST report “Engage to Excel,” which urged the STEM education community and funding agencies to “advocate and provide support for replacing standard laboratory courses with discovery-based research courses.” The Convocation report “Integrating Discovery-Based Research into the Undergraduate STEM Curriculum” on which this session is based explores a number of critical issues: Is our current knowledge base robust enough to recommend best practices? Is offering such experiences actually beneficial for all undergraduates? What institutional changes will be required to make such opportunities available to large numbers of students? Can such programs drive institutional change? How can we manage the cost/benefit parameters of such programs? Exploring these important and connected issues is critical for allowing undergraduates to participate in meaningful and relevant research through their coursework, for faculty and administrators to examine and document the evidence for their impact, and institutions to identify variations in what works at different types of colleges and universities.",

            "abstract": "The jump to university level exams can be challenging for some students, often resulting in poor marks, which may be detrimental to their confidence and ultimately affect their overall degree class. Previous studies have found that question structure can have a strong impact on the performance of students in college level exams (see Gibson et al., 2015, for a discussion of its impact on physics undergraduates).\nHere, we investigate the effect of question structure on the exam results of geology and geophysics undergraduate students. Specifically, we analyse the performance of students in questions that have a ‘scaffolded’ framework and compare them to their performance in open-ended questions and coursework. We also investigate if observed differences in exam performance are correlated with the educational background and gender of students, amongst other factors.\nIt is important for all students to be able to access their degree courses, no matter what their backgrounds may be. Broadening participation in the geosciences relies on removing systematic barriers to achievement. Therefore we recommend that exams are either structured with scaffolding in questions at lower levels, or students are explicitly prepared for this transition. We also recommend that longitudinal studies of exam performance are conducted within individual departments, and this work outlines one approach to analysing performance data.",

            "abstract": "The NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission was successfully launched January 31st 2015, inaugurating global operational low frequency (L-band) microwave observations of land surface soil moisture and freeze-thaw dynamics with 3-day mean temporal fidelity. The novelty of SMAP is in the high quality of the geophysical observations, global monitoring of dynamic landscape freeze-thaw (FT) and soil moisture (SM) conditions, and the model-enhanced estimation of root zone soil moisture (0-100 cm) and terrestrial carbon fluxes (constrained by environmental controls). The SMAP Level 4 Carbon Product (L4_C) uses lower-level geophysical data to constrain estimates of terrestrial net CO2 exchange and addresses a key science objective of the SMAP mission, which is to understand processes that link the terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles, particularly in boreal landscapes. Here we present the L4_C calibration and validation infrastructure, which uses eddy covariance tower flux observations. A metric of L4_C product success is to estimate NEE in northern (≥45°N) boreal and arctic biomes to within 30 gCm-2yr-1 or ~1.6 gCm-2 d-1 RMSE, similar to the level of uncertainty for tower observations. We present initial L4_C product comparisons against independent observations from a global network of 33 in situ tower sites, 8 of which are considered primary sites in the high latitudes (≥45°N). Although only primary sites are used to determine product success, all sites are integrated into diagnostic plots to evaluate land cover heterogeneity between local tower footprints and overlying L4_C grid cells, algorithm handling and data quality, thus providing a framework for evaluating environmental constraints on ecosystem productivity and respiration. In addition to mission success, we examine the added value of including FT and SM to constrain terrestrial carbon flux estimates.",

The impact of Greenland ice sheet mass loss on the ongoing global sea level rise has raised concern and a better understanding of the reaction of the ice sheet to a future warmer climate is needed. Yet, observational records of surface melting have so far only been in the form of stake readings or short-term discharge measurements. Here we present continuous, long-term observations of discharge from pro-glacial lake Tasersiaq in West Greenland (66.3°N, 50.4°W) whose drainage basin extends over around 8500 km2 of which around 80% is ice covered (by Greenland Ice Sheet and local glaciers). The discharge time series covers the period from 1975 to 2014 and gives insight into the hydrological system’s reaction to climatic forcing, e.g. a clear impact from major volcanic eruptions is observed. Over the entire data period a significant positive trend of 0.06 km3/yr in annual discharge is seen, where the median annual discharge is 2.50 km3. In addition to the trend in annual discharge a large and increasing year-to-year variability is observed. We examine both discharge trend and variability in the context of atmospheric circulation patterns and indicators of climate variability.",

Overestimate of the first aerosol indirect effect in current GCM is partly related to the uncertainties associated with the cloud spectral dispersion. Empirical, semi-empirical and analytical expressions of spectral shape parameters are examined within the cloud microphysical scheme in NCAR CAM5 (Community Atmosphere Model, version 5.0). Simulated values of cloud effective radius are compared with MODIS and CERES retrievals in low level clouds to verify the dispersion parameterizations. As a result, the first aerosol indirect effect is globally reduced by 15% with the empirical method but enhanced by 9% with the analytical method. Impacts of different dispersion parameterizations on model simulated cloud, radiation and precipitation characteristics are also evaluated against various observations.",

These techniques can be further applied to determine 13C-D clumped isotope effects of methyl fragments, therefore need accurate equilirbium Δi values to calibrate experimental measurements. In this study, we calculate temperature depandences of 13C-D clumped isotope signatures in methyl of several organic compounds including ethane, propane, acetic acid, etc. Our calculation are performed at CCSD/6-311+G(3df,3pd) by using Gaussian 03 program with no scale treament.\nOur results show that the Δi values of 13C-D clumping in methyl fragments of different organic compounds yield similar signals (~5.5‰ at 25˚C, slightly lower than Δi value of 13C-D clumping in methane). For testing the calculated accuracy, theoretical treaments beyond the harmonic level by including several higher-order corrections to the Bigeleisen-Mayer equation are used. Contributions from higher-order corrections (e.g., AnZPE, AnEXC, VrZPE, VrEXC, QmCorr and CenDist) are estimated to repire the ignorings of the Bigeleisen-Mayer equation (the anharmonic effects of vibration, vibration-rotation coupling, quantum mechanics and centrifugal distortion for rotation, etc.) for the calculation of partition function ratios. The results show that the higher-order corrections contribute ~0.05‰ at 25˚C, which is similar to the contribution for calculating 13C-D clumped isotope signature of methane. By comparing our calculated frequencies to the measured ones, the uncertainty of our calculation of Δi values 13C-D clumping in methyl fragments is considered to be within ~0.05‰ at room temperature.",

            "abstract": "In recent years climate change has emerged as a source of vulnerability for agro-livestock smallholders in Nepal where people are mostly dependent on rain-fed agriculture and livestock farming for their livelihoods. There is a need to understand and predict the potential impacts of climate change on agro-livestock farmer to develop effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. To understand dynamics of this vulnerability, we assess the farmers’ perceptions of climate change, analysis of historical and future projections of climatic parameters and try to understand impact of climate change on livestock system in Gandaki River Basin of Central Nepal.\nDuring the period of 1981-2012, as reported by the mountain communities, the most serious hazards for livestock system and agriculture are the increasing trend of temperature, erratic rainfall patterns and increase in drought. Poor households without irrigated land are facing greater risks and stresses than well-off people. Analysis of historical climate data also supports the farmer perception. Result shows that there is increasing trend of temperature but no consistent trend in precipitation but a notable finding is that wet areas are getting wetter and dry areas getting drier. Besides that, there is increase in percentage of warm days and nights with decrease in the cool nights and days. The magnitude of the trend is found to be higher in high altitude. Trend of wet days has found to be increasing with decreasing in rainy days. Most areas are characterized by increases in both severity and frequency of drought and are more evident in recent years. The summers of 2004/05/06/09 and winters of 2006/08/09 were the worst widespread droughts and have a serious impact on livestock since 1981. Future projected change in temperature and precipitation obtained from downscaling the data global model by regional climate model shows that precipitation in central Nepal will change by -8% to 12% and temperature will change by 1.9 0C to 3 0C in 2031-2060 compared to the baseline period 1970-2000. Since there will be an increase in temperature and most of the area will experience decreasing rainfall we can predict that there will be increasing vulnerability on livestock system in central Nepal in future which is already facing a serious impact.",

Each of these campaigns have approximately two hundred vertical soundings of CO2 within the lower troposphere (surface to about 5 km) at 6-8 different sites in each of the urban area. In this study, we used structure function analysis, which are a useful way to quantify spatial and temporal variability, by displaying differences with average observations, to evaluate the variability of CO2 in the 0-2 km range (representative of the planetary boundary layer). These results can then be used to provide guidance in the development of science requirements for the future ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons) mission to measure near-surface CO2 variability in different urban areas. We compare the observed in-situ CO2 variability with the variability of the CO2 column-averaged optical depths in the 0-1 km and 0-3.5 km altitude ranges in the four geographically different urban areas, using vertical weighting functions for potential future ASCENDS lidar CO2 sensors operating in the 1.57 and 2.05 μm measurement regions. In addition to determining the natural variability of CO2 near the surface and in the column, radiocarbon and anthropogenic pollution tracers are used to examine the variation of emission sources among these urban sites.",

Lake sediments provide important archives of terrestrial climate change, and represent an important tool for reconstructing paleohydrology, paleoclimate, paleoenvironment, and paleoaltimetry. Unfortunately, while multiple methods for constraining marine temperature exist, quantitative terrestrial proxies are scarcer – tree rings, speleothems, and leaf margin analyses have all been used with varying degrees of accuracy. Clumped isotope thermometry has the potential to be a useful instrument for determining terrestrial climates: multiple studies have shown the fraction of 13C—18O bonds in carbonates is inversely related to the temperature at which the rocks formed. We have been measuring the abundance of 13C18O16O in the CO2 produced by the dissolution of carbonate minerals in phosphoric acid in modern lake samples and comparing results to independently known estimates of lake water temperature. Here we discuss an extensive calibration dataset comprised of 132 analyses of 97 samples from 44 localities, including microbialites, tufas, and micrites endogenic carbonates, freshwater gastropods, bivalves, microbialites, and ooids.",

            "abstract": "One advantage of analytical models, in which analytic expressions are used for the various components of the subduction system, is the efficient exploration of parameter space and identification of the physical mechanisms controlling a wide breadth of slab kinematics. We show that, despite subtle differences in how plate interfaces and boundary conditions are implemented, results for single subduction from a 3-D semi-analytical model for subduction FAST (Royden & Husson, 2006; Jagoutz et al., 2015) and from the numerical finite-element model CitcomCU (Moresi & Gurnis, 1996, Zhong et al., 2006) are in excellent agreement when plate coupling (via shear stress on the plate interface) takes place in the FAST without the development of topographic relief at the plate boundary. Results from the two models are consistent across a variety of geometries, with fixed upper plate, fixed lower plate, and stress-free plate ends. When the analytical model is modified to include the development of topography above the subduction boundary, subduction rates are greatly increased, indicating a strong sensitivity of subduction to the mode of plate coupling. Rates of subduction also correlate strongly with the asthenospheric pressure drop across the subducting slab, which drives toroidal flow of the asthenosphere around the slab. When the lower plate is fixed, subduction is relatively slow and the pressure drop from below to above the slab is large, inhibiting subduction and slab roll-back. When the upper plate is fixed and when the plate ends are stress-free, subduction rates are approximately 50% faster and the corresponding asthenospheric pressure drop from below to above the slab is small, facilitating rapid subduction. This qualitative correlation between plate coupling processes, asthenospheric pressure drop, and rates of subduction can be extended to systems with more than one subduction zone (Holt et al., 2015 AGU Fall Abstract).\nJagoutz, O., Royden, L., Holt, A. & Becker, T.

Here we study by means of resistive, compressible MHD simulations the behavior of current sheets whose inverse aspect ratio scales with the Lundquist number S as S-1/3, known to give rise to fast, ideal reconnection, with an evolution and growth that are independent of S. In the linear phase we retrieve the expected eigenmodes and the growth rate, which can be as high as γ ≈ 0.6 τA-1, where τA is the ideal Alfvénic time set by the macroscopic scales. The nonlinear stages are characterized by the coalescence of magnetic islands and by secondary reconnection events, obeying the same critical scaling with the local S, leading to the production and ejection of plasmoids on increasingly shorter timescales. Preliminary simulations of the ideal tearing mode are presented also for magnetically dominated plasmas, in the relativistic MHD regime.",

This technique is based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the simultaneously received direct (line-of-sight) and coherently ground reflected signals.\nIn this contribution, forward and inverse modeling of SNR observations is presented for GLONASS-MR, extending GPS-MR to multiple GNSS. The coupling of the surface and antenna responses from short-delay near-grazing incidence multipath from CDMA and FDMA satellite navigation systems are simulated using an electromagnetic forward model. The inverse model is used to estimate parameter corrections responsible for observation residuals to estimate snow depth. The correlation between snow depth retrievals using GPS L2C signal and GLONASS R2-C/A signal is excellent, with r2 value of 0.990.\nIn a related approach, dual-frequency SNR-based GNSS-MR, which is based on linear combination of SNR observables, is used to estimate snow depth. This ionospheric delay free method synthesizes longer carrier wavelengths (“widelaning” or delta-k) to isolate the direct power contribution in environmental retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Accurate seismic source locations and their geometries are important to improve ground-based system monitoring; however, a few number of Ground Truth (GT) events are available in most regions within Eurasia and Middle East. In this study GT event locations were found for several earthquakes in the Middle East and Africa, including Saudi Arabia and Tanzania, with location errors of less that 5 km. These events were acquired through analyzing several local and near-regional waveforms for hundreds of earthquakes in these areas. A large number of earthquakes occurred beneath the Harrat Lunayyir in northwest Saudi Arabia in 2009. From the 15 Lunayyir GT events recorded on three-component seismographs, 5 with Mw between 3.4 and 5.9 were used for successfully obtaining source parameters. A moment tensor inversion was applied on filtered surface wave data to obtain the best-fitting source mechanism, moment magnitude, and depth. The uncertainty in the derived parameters was investigated by applying the same inversion to selected traces and frequency bands. Focal mechanism for these earthquakes demonstrates normal faulting with a NW-SE trend for all of the events except one, which has a NE-SW trend. The shallow 3 km depth obtained for all the events is consistent with previous studies of dyke intrusion in the area. Spectral analysis of S waves and source parameters for these earthquakes are in progress to find static stress drop, corner frequency and radiated energy.",

In the framework of this project a number of research flights were performed within and above the Inn Valley in order to assess the three-dimensional turbulence structure. At the same time additional (to the usual program) surface-based observations using scintillometers were performed. Wavelet analysis (as well as traditional Fourier analysis) was used to assess the airborne 100 Hz data. The surface-based turbulence data underwent the usual post-processing and quality control with special attention required due to complex terrain. Good agreement between wavelet and Fourier-derived turbulence integral statistics is obtained.\nIn this contribution we present first results on the three-dimensional flow and thermodynamic structure of the valley atmosphere under predominantly fair-weather (convective) conditions on three days in the late summer of 2013. The morning flights are mostly characterized through a relatively shallow (some few hundred meters) turbulent boundary layer while in the afternoon the boundary layer top is higher - but does not reach the height of the surrounding crests.\nThe spatial characteristics of turbulent fluxes (heat and momentum) as well as those of TKE are presented. Due to the east-west orientation of the valley the northern (south-facing) slopes experience stronger heat fluxes and TKE production throughout the day. The same applies to the surface heat fluxes. If the latter (from a surface site on the northern slope) are used to scale vertical TKE profiles throughout the valley atmosphere reduced scatter is obtained when compared to employing the true surface value, i.e. that at the foot of the actual profile. This is similar, albeit less pronounced, as reported from the Riviera Valley in southern Switzerland.",

            "abstract": "We discuss how, in a collisionless magnetized plasma, a sheared velocity field may lead to the anisotropization of an initial Maxwellian state. By including the full pressure tensor dynamics in a fluid plasma model, we show, analytically and numerically, that a sheared velocity field makes an initial isotropic state anisotropic and non-gyrotropic [1], i.e., makes the plasma pressure tensor anisotropic also in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. The propagation of transverse magneto-elastic waves in the anisotropic plasma affects the process of formation of a non-gyrotropic pressure and can lead to its spatial filamentation. This plasma dynamics implies in particular that isotropic MHD equilibria cease to be equilibria in presence of a stationary sheared flow. Similarly, in the case of turbulence, where small-scale spatial inhomogeneities are naturally developed during the direct cascade, we may expect that isotropic turbulent states are not likely to exist whenever a full pressure tensor evolution is accounted for. These results may be relevant to understanding the agyrotropic pressure configurations which are well documented in solar wind measurements and possibly correlated to plasma flows (see e.g. Refs.[2,3]), and which have also been measured in Vlasov simulations of Alfvenic turbulence [4].\n[1] D.

The authors have developed process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model (2014, 2015, etc.), which includes feedback between hydrologic-geomorphic-ecological processes. In this study, NICE was further developed to couple with various biogeochemical cycle models in biosphere, those for water quality in aquatic ecosystems, and those for carbon weathering. The NICE-biogeochemical coupling model incorporates connectivity of the biogeochemical cycle accompanied by hydrologic cycle between surface water and groundwater, hillslopes and river networks, and other intermediate regions. The model also includes reaction between inorganic and organic carbons, and its relation to nitrogen and phosphorus in terrestrial-aquatic continuum. The coupled model showed to improve the accuracy of inundation stress mechanism such as photosynthesis and primary production, which attributes to improvement of CH4 flux in wetland sensitive to fluctuations of shallow groundwater. The model also simulated CO2 evasion from inland water in global scale, and was relatively in good agreement in empirical relation (Aufdenkampe et al., 2011) which has relatively an uncertainty in the calculated flux because of pCO2 data missing in some region and effect of small tributaries, etc. Further, the model evaluated how the expected CO2 evasion might change as inland waters become polluted with nutrients and eutrophication increases from agriculture and urban areas (Pacheco et al., 2013). This advanced eco-hydrologic and biogeochemical coupling model would play important role to re-evaluate greenhouse gas budget of the biosphere, and to bridge gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches (Battin et al., 2009; Regnier et al., 2013).",

            "abstract": "To better understand the effects of anhydrite precipitation on mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems, we conducted 2-D numerical simulations of two-phase hydrothermal circulation in a NaCl-H2O fluid at the East Pacific Rise 9°50’N. The simulations were constrained by key observational thermal data and seismicity that suggests the fluid flow is primarily along axis with recharge focused into a small zone near a 4th order discontinuity. The simulations considered an open-top square box with a fixed seafloor pressure of 25 MPa, and nominal seafloor temperature of 10 °C. The sides of the box were assumed to be impermeable and insulated. We considered two models: a homogeneous model with a permeability of 10-13 m2 and a heterogeneous model in which layer 2A extrusives were given a higher permeability. Both models had a fixed bottom temperature distribution and initial porosity of 0.1. Assuming that anhydrite precipitation resulted from the decrease in solubility with increasing temperature as downwelling fluid gets heated, we calculated the rate of porosity decrease and sealing times in each cell at certain time snapshots in the simulations. The results showed that sealing would occur most rapidly in limited regions near the base of the high-temperature plumes, where complete sealing could occur on decadal time scales. Though more detailed analysis is needed, it appeared that the areas of rapid sealing would likely have negligible impact on the overall circulation pattern and hydrothermal vent temperatures. The simulations also indicated that sealing due to anhydrite precipitation would occur more slowly at the margins of the ascending plumes. The sealing times in the deep recharge zone determined in these simulations were considerably greater than estimated from 1D analytical calculations, suggesting that with a 2D model, focused recharge at the EPR 9°50’N site may occur, at least on a decadal time scale.",

All types of citizen science endeavors face challenges around data access and management, around relationships with scientists and project managers, and around making their scientific accomplishments visible as they accumulate over time. Among the most universal and ongoing challenges for all types of citizen science, however, “is attracting and retaining enough participants to make achievement of project goals possible.” (Crowston and Prestopnik\nOne known reason for this issue is the reality that individual projects and project types exist in “silos” – as self-segregated groups with particular shared interests (Dickinson et al. 2010).

How do we support participation in, and management of, multiple projects; continuity in, and sharing of, a broad and accessible citizen science community; and related social components?\nThis presentation will provide a brief overview of the known barriers to this \"utopia\" and a snapshot of efforts underway to address many of these barriers.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are one of the fundamental controls of Earth’s climate past, present and future. Significant research effort has been expended attempting to produce accurate and precise reconstructions of GHG concentrations through the geologic past. As Earth System modellers, policy makers and the wider public increasingly rely on paleo-CO2 reconstructions to ground-truth and inform climate models capable of predicting future conditions, reliable estimates have never been more important.\nRecently doubts have begun to emerge about the accuracy and precision of the key biomarker-based tool for CO2 reconstruction - based on measuring compound specific alkenone δ13C values - in part due to discrepancies between values calculated using this proxy and records generated utilising the boron isotopic composition of planktic foraminifera. Meanwhile, increasing efforts are being expended to investigate other potentially important GHGs such as CH4 during critical intervals in the Cenozoic.\nHere we present new, coupled alkenone δ13C – boron δ11B CO2 records across a full glacial-interglacial cycle from identical samples at ODP Site 999 in the Caribbean Sea. This allows comparison between the two palaeo-CO2 proxies currently most frequently used, with more direct measurements of atmospheric GHGs from ice cores. Our results suggest that current alkenone-based CO2 estimates may require reassessment – especially at lower levels of atmospheric pCO2. We discuss the implications of this work for our understanding of atmospheric pCO2 evolution through the Cenozoic in the context of new CO2 records from the Eocene. We also introduce new efforts to ground-truth numerical model-derived changes in CH4 with lipid biomarker evidence for methane processing from globally-distributed terrestrial Eocene deposits, and discuss the impact and importance of CH4 on global climate.",

            "abstract": "High resolution spatially extended values of climate variables play a central role in the assessment of climate and projected future climate in ecosystem modeling. The ground based meteorological network remains a key resource for deriving these spatially extended climate variables. We report on the production, and applications, of new anomaly based fine scale spatial interpolations of key climate variables at daily and monthly time scale, across the Australian continent. The methods incorporate several innovations that have significantly improved spatial predictive accuracy, as well as providing a platform for the incorporation of additional remotely sensed data. The interpolated climate data are supporting many continent-wide ecosystem modeling applications and are playing a key role in testing optimality hypotheses associated with plant functional types (PFTs). The accuracy, and robustness to data error, of anomaly-based interpolation has been enhanced by incorporating physical process aspects of the different climate variables and employing robust statistical methods implemented in the ANUSPLIN package. New regression procedures have also been developed to estimate “background” monthly climate normals from all stations with minimal records to substantially increase the density of supporting spatial networks. Monthly mean temperature interpolation has been enhanced by incorporating process based coastal effects that have reduced predictive error by around 10%. Overall errors in interpolated monthly temperature fields are around 25% less than errors reported by an earlier study. For monthly and daily precipitation, a new anomaly structure has been devised to take account of the skewness in precipitation data and the large proportion of zero values that present significant challenges to standard interpolation methods. The many applications include continent-wide Gross Primary Production modeling and assessing constraints on light and water use efficiency derived from the TERN OzFlux network. Redundancy analysis (RDA) has also been used to explain plant trait variance in tropical forest dynamics. Aggregates of ANUClimate data, including annual mean solar radiation, temperature and moisture index, performed well predicting biophysical trait observations (35% of variance).",

            "abstract": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) contribute to about 90% of the emitted VOC globally with isoprene being one of the most abundant BVOC (Guenther 2002). Intensive efforts in studying and understanding the impact of BVOC on atmospheric chemistry were undertaken in the recent years. However many uncertainties remain, e.g. field studies have shown that in wooded areas measured OH reactivity can often not be explained by measured BVOC and their oxidation products (e.g. Noelscher et al. 2012). This discrepancy may be explained by either a lack of understanding of BVOC sources or insufficient understanding of BVOC oxidation mechanisms. Plants emit a complex VOC mixture containing likely many compounds which have not yet been measured or identified (Goldstein and Galbally 2007). A lack of understanding BVOC sources limits bottom-up estimates of secondary products of BVOC oxidation such as SOA. Similarly, the widespread oversimplification of atmospheric chemistry in simulation experiments, using single compound or simple BVOC mixtures to study atmospheric chemistry processes limit our ability to assess air quality and climate impacts of BVOC. We will present applications of the new extension PLUS (PLant chamber Unit for Simulation) to our atmosphere simulation chamber SAPHIR. PLUS is used to produce representative BVOC mixtures from direct plant emissions. We will report on the performance and characterization of the newly developed chamber. As an exemplary application, trees typical of a Boreal forest environment were used to compare OH reactivity as directly measured by LIF to the OH reactivity calculated from BVOC measured by GC-MS and PTRMS. The comparison was performed for both, primary emissions of trees without any influence of oxidizing agents and using different oxidation schemes. For the monoterpene emitters investigated here, we show that discrepancies between measured and calculated total OH reactivity increase with increasing degree of oxidation. Implications for field studies and needs for future research are discussed.",

However, the quantification of regolith production rate in temperate climates encountered some limitations when analyzing only superficial samples in the first meter of soil (Rihs et al, 2011). Here, we propose to combine the analysis of U-Th-Ra disequilibrium with the cosmogenic in situ Be in a weathering profile extending from the top soil to the granitic fractured bedrock at 2 m of depth to better estimate both production and denudation rate of regolith.\nThe weathering profile is located on the top of the watershed and was sampled with a high spatial resolution (15 samples). Whole-rock data show trends of variation for major and trace element concentrations and for U-Th-Ra disequilibria, which are different in the upper part of the regolith (0-80 cm) and in the deeper part of the fractured saprolith and/or bedrock (100cm-200cm). U-series isotopes in the surface of the profile are difficult to interpret in terms of weathering rate, while the disequilibria in the deeper weathered bedrock show a smooth trend of variation. The modeling of the U-Th-Ra data in this deeper part of the profile, performed with a nuclide gain and loss model, leads to a regolith production rate of 35 ± 10 T/km²/year. In addition, a numerical optimization for nonlinear inverse problem has been performed to estimate the exposure age and the mean denudation rate at the summit from the Be data. The results show that the exposure age of the profile is about 20 000 years and the mean denudation rate is 37 ± 15 T/km²/year. The consistency between the regolith production rate and the soil denudation rate suggests therefore that in such a temperate context, the long-term mass balance of soil developed on granitic bedrock would be close to a steady-state.",

Here we analyzed causes and scale of Siberian pine and fir mortality in Altai-Sayan and Baikal Lake Regions and West Siberian Plane based on in situdata and remote sensing (QuickBird, Landsat, GRACE).\nGeographically, mortality began on the margins of the DNC range (i.e., within the forest-steppe and conifer-broadleaf ecotones) and on terrain features with maximal water stress risk (narrow-shaped hilltops, convex steep south facing slopes, shallow well-drained soils). Within ridges, mortality occurred mainly along mountain passes, where stands faced drying winds. Regularly mortality was observed to decrease with elevation increase with the exception of Baikal Lake Mountains, where it was minimal near the lake shore and increased with elevation (up to about 1000 m a.s.l.).\nSiberian pine and fir mortality followed a drying trend with consecutive droughts since the 1980s. Dendrochronology analysis showed that mortality was correlated with vapor pressure deficit increase, drought index, soil moisture decrease and occurrence of late frosts. In Baikal region Siberian pine mortality correlated with Baikal watershed meteorological variables. An impact of previous year climate conditions on the current growth was found (r2 = 0.6). Thus, water-stressed trees became sensitive to bark beetles and fungi impact (including Polygraphus proximus and Heterobasidion annosum).\nAt present, an increase in mortality is observed within the majority of DNC range. Results obtained also showed a primary role of water stress in that phenomenon with a secondary role of bark beetles and fungi attacks. In future climate with increased drought severity and frequency Siberian pine and fir will partly disappear from its current range, and will be substituted by drought-tolerant species (e.g., Pinus silvestris, Larix sibirica).",

Hum. Evol.). The cause of the disappearance (e.g. climate change, volcanic catastrophe or human competition) has not been established. Here, we present a new 92,000-year long speleothem δ13C record for Liang Luar cave, 800m South of Liang Bua. Our record acts as a proxy for local environmental and vegetation health throughout H. floresiensis’ occupation of the area.\nThe Liang Luar speleothem δ13C record is primarily a record of vegetation productivity and soil respiration rates, highlighting local ecological responses to changing regional and global climate forcings such as temperature, atmospheric pCO2 and precipitation amount. Changes in speleothem δ13C can largely be considered an environmental response to climate change.\nEvents that caused significant harm to the local environment and H. floresiensis are likely to be outside the natural range of variability: being quick enough or extreme enough that adaptation to new conditions is not possible. We identify disturbances to the vegetation system using two indicators in the speleothem record. 1) Abrupt positive δ13C excursions which indicate periods of reduced vegetative activity. 2) A loss of correlation between the δ13C and δ18O records, indicating that precipitation is no longer a dominant control on vegetation productivity. The largest (8‰) and longest (7 kyr) abrupt positive excursion, the 68 kyr event, sees positive speleothem δ13C values, due to increased bedrock contribution and/or C4 vegetation at this time. Crucially a H. floresiensis occupation interval dates to this period.\nThe largest abrupt deterioration in vegetation (positive δ13C excursion) between 17 and 10 kyr BP is a 1 in 5kyr occurrence - An event of a magnitude that was likely encountered and survived by H. floresiensis multiple times during the last 90kyr. The mechanism/s that led to the disappearance of H. floresiensis must have been highly selective, and did not have a major impact on the local environment. This seemingly rules out volcanism and climate change as potential agents, leaving us with an intriguing puzzle as to what caused the recent extinction of Homo floresiensis.",

The model is separated into multiple tectonic blocks, for which we estimate the first order rheological properties and the impact on the dynamics of the collision system. This is done by performing systematic simulations with different rheologies to minimize the misfit to observational constraints such as the GPS-velocity field.\nThe simulations are performed with the parallel staggered grid FD code LaMEM using a numerical resolution of at least 512x512x256 cells to resolve dynamically important shear zones reasonably well.\nA fundamental part of this study is the reconstruction of the 3D present-day geometry of Tibet and the adjacent regions. Our interpretations of crust and mantle lithosphere geometry are jointly based on a globally available shear wave tomography (Schaeffer and Lebedev, 2013) and the Crust 1.0 model (Laske et al. http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/crust1.html). We regionally refined and modified our interpretations based on seismicity distributions and focal mechanisms and incorporated regional receiver function studies to improve the accuracy of the Moho in particular.\nResults suggest that we can identify at least one “best-fit” solution in terms of rheological model properties that reproduces the observed velocity field reasonably well, including the strong rotation of the GPS velocity around the eastern syntax of the Himalaya. We also present model co-variances to illustrate the trade-offs between the rheological model parameters, their respective uncertainties, and the model fit.\nSchaeffer, A.J., Lebedev, S., 2013.

            "abstract": "The change from fossil to renewable energy sources is demanding an increasing amount of storage capacities for electrical energy. A promising technological solution is the storage of hydrogen in the subsurface. Hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis using excessive electrical energy and subsequently converted back into electricity by fuel cells or engine generators. The development of this technology starts with adding small amounts of hydrogen to the high pressure natural gas grid and continues with the creation of pure underground hydrogen storages.\nThe feasibility of hydrogen storage in depleted gas reservoirs is investigated in the lighthouse project H2STORE financed by the German Ministry for Education and Research. The joint research project has project members from the University of Jena, the Clausthal University of Technology, the GFZ Potsdam and the French National Center for Scientic Research in Nancy. The six sub projects are based on laboratory experiments, numerical simulations and analytical work which cover the investigation of mineralogical, geochemical, physio-chemical, sedimentological, microbiological and gas mixing processes in reservoir and cap rocks.\nThe focus in this presentation is on the numerical modeling of underground hydrogen storage. A mathematical model was developed which describes the involved coupled hydrodynamic and microbiological effects. Thereby, the bio-chemical reaction rates depend on the kinetics of microbial growth which is induced by the injection of hydrogen. The model has been numerically implemented on the basis of the open source code DuMuX. A field case study based on a real German gas reservoir was performed to investigate the mixing of hydrogen with residual gases and to discover the consequences of bio-chemical reactions.",

Because it is on the subducting side of the plate interface, New Caledonia is considered to be stable to first order and not to undergo rapid deformation. However, moderate seismicity is recorded close to the plate interface, in the southern part of the main land and along the Loyalty ridge. In addition, the main island and Loyalty ridge are subjected to long-term vertical deformation due to the flexure of the plate entering subduction.\nA geodetic network was installed since the early days of GPS (~1990) and has been further developed and occasionally measured since. Due to the low number of global GNSS recording stations in the early 1990s, the positioning accuracy that can be achieved with these data is poor compared to present-day standards, and expected movements are slow (possibly less than 1 mm/yr). However, the >20 year length of the time series may allow us to determine the current deformation field in New Caledonia and Loyalty Ridge.\nWe pay special care in using older GNSS data for characterizing ground motions, reprocessing all available data using a range of different processing strategies and products. We calculated daily positions from double-differenced ionosphere-free carrier phase data in a global network using the GAMIT software and combined and aligned the results on the ITRF2008 using the CATREF software, according to the processing strategy developed as part of the current ULR6 (www.sonel.org) reprocessing campaign for IGS. We compare the double difference results with those obtained in PPP mode using JPL GIPSY software as well as CNES GINS software and different products (MIT, JPL and GRG orbits and clocks provided in the framework of the IGS2 reprocessing campaign). We present both the results for New Caledonia and an analysis of the applicability of these different processing strategies to older GNSS datasets.",

More recently NCI collocated 10 Petabytes of 34 major national and international environmental, climate, earth system, geophysics and astronomy data collections to create the National Environmental Research Interoperability Data Platform (NERDIP). Spatial scales of the collections range from global to local ultra-high resolution, whilst sizes range from 3PB down to a few GB. The data is highly connected to both NCI HPC and cloud resources via low latency internal networks with massive bandwidth.\nNow that the collections are collocated on a single data platform, the ‘Hype’ and expectations around potential use cases for the NERDIP are high. Not unexpected issues are emerging such as access, licensing issues, ownership, and incompatible data standards. Many communities are standardised within their domain, but achieving true interdisciplinary science will require all communities to move towards open interoperable data formats such as NetCDF4/HDF5. This transition will impact on software using proprietary or non-open standards.\nBut before we reach the ‘Plateau of Productivity’, there needs to be greater ‘Enlightenment’ of users to encourage them to realise that this unprecedented Earth system science platform provides a rich mine of opportunities for discovery and innovation for a diverse range of both domain-specific and interdisciplinary investigations including climate and weather research, impact analysis, environment, remote sensing and geophysics and develop new and innovative interdisciplinary use cases that will guide those architecting the system and help minimise the amplitude of the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’ and ensure greater productivity and uptake of the collections that make NERDIP unique in the next generation of Data-intensive Science.",

It’s because arc-continent collision occurs in the western Taiwan, resulting in the orogeny has formed a fold-and-thrust belt, developing a series of thrusts aligned in north-south direction. The thrust faults, locating in the central island, are the oldest and have almost inactive. Westward to the island, the faults become younger, dipping angles are smaller, and motions were stronger. On the west side, the foot of the Taiwan Western Foothill is considered the youngest thrust faults located along west Taiwan. Scholars recognized them as so-called the deformation front, and they also believed that the deformation front is located in between the compressive terrain uplifted area and the extensional subsidence area. Therefore, this front line is on the boundary of two different tectonic zones. This study investigates the trace of the deformation front in Miaoli area. Previous studies suggested that the west side of Miaoli collision zone should be fault-bounded, and is located in the seabed. However, in the geological map, there is no geologic evidence that appears on land and so-called active faults related with this deformation front. In the near coast seafloor, according to the reflection earthquakes data from the Institute of Oceanography of NTU, we can only see the offshore strata have been uplifted, and the data also shows that seabed is only covered by thin layer of sediments. This study indicates that in offshore place within three kilometers, shallow formations show a special layer of slime which was extruded to be corrugated transversely. Accordingly, we believe that this slime layer should be pressurized and filled with muddy water. Such features should be further investigated with other geological and geophysical survey data to check if they belong to the structural product of the deformation front.",

The principal aim of this study is the characterization of the groundwater flow field, both in velocity and direction. The results of the geophysical survey are described and compared to several simulated datasets conducted on a 3D model simulating flow, transport and electrical current. In this manner it is possible to assess the information content of the Mise-á-la-Masse dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics. The study shows how a combination of three-dimensional time-lapse modelling of flow, tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of Mise-á-la-Masse measurements during saline tracer tests. This approach can thus revive the use of Mise-á-la-Masse as a practical, low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring, particularly for shallow aquifers, providing critical information concerning the natural groundwater flow direction and velocity.",

            "abstract": "Dust particles are an important driver of ice nucleation and glaciation in mixed-phase clouds. With that they influence precipitation and the hydrological cycle. Dust particles mostly originate from natural source regions, like deserts, and consist of different minerals, e.g. clay, feldspar, quartz. Soil dust particles, which originate from agricultural sites also consist of a small fraction of organic matter. It has been shown in different studies that this small fraction of organic matter influences the ice nucleating ability of the dust particles. Soil dusts have been found to be more efficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs) compared to mineral dusts. Currently global climate models do not consider a difference between soil dust and desert dust or the source of dust particles. Since soil dust is becoming increasingly important due to the increase of agricultural areas, we make a first attempt to quantify the importance of soil dust as an INP on a global scale in present and possible future conditions.\nFor our study we use a version of the global climate-aerosol model ECHAM6-HAM2, where it is possible to differentiate between soil dust and desert dust emissions. Furthermore, new parameterizations to describe the ice nucleation capability of desert and soil dusts are implemented. We present how the different parameterization schemes in combination with the dust type influence the freezing process and thus the properties of mixed-phase clouds, precipitation and their climate impact.",

The basic idea behind these infrastructures is the provision of services supporting scientists to search, visualize and access data, to collaborate and exchange information, as well as to publish data and other results. Especially the management of research data is gaining more and more importance. In geosciences these developments have to be merged with the enhanced data management approaches of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI).\n The Centre for GeoInformationTechnology (CeGIT) at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences has the objective to establish concepts and standards of SDIs as an integral part of research infrastructure architectures. In different projects, solutions to manage research data for land- and water management or environmental monitoring have been developed based on a framework consisting of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) components. The framework provides basic components supporting the import and storage of data, discovery and visualization as well as data documentation (metadata).\n In our contribution, we present our data management solutions developed in three projects, Central Asian Water (CAWa), Sustainable Management of River Oases (SuMaRiO) and Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) where FOSS components build the backbone of the data management platform. The multiple use and validation of tools helped to establish a standardized architectural blueprint serving as a contribution to Research Infrastructures. We examine the question of whether FOSS tools are really a sustainable choice and whether the increased efforts of maintenance are justified. Finally it should help to answering the question if the use of FOSS for Research Infrastructures is a success story.",

As for nine rain gauges in IzuOshima Island, precipitation amount exceeded the threshold of the special warning for 3 hours. However, the special warning was not announced because it did not satisfy \"heavy rainfall over the threshold value is recorded at more than 10 points\". It is suggested that the special warning at islands is hard to be announced. Therefore we propose to apply GSMaP which can be used not only over land but over ocean for the special warning. We calculated the threshold of the special warning by using GSMaP data and compared it with that by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).\nGSMaP has the following characteristics.\n・GSMaP estimates precipitation every hour with the resolution of 0.1 degrees grid.\n・GSMaP is not good at orographic rainfall , but it is good at rainfall over the Tropics and ocean.\n・GSMaP covers almost all over the world between 60 degrees north and south.\nThe standard of JMA is as follows.\n・The amount of rainfall in 3 hours exceed 50-year value at 10 points in the spread of the prefecture degree.\n・The amount of rainfall in 48 hours exceed 50-year value at 50 points in the spread of the prefecture degree.\nWe calculated the amount of 50-year rainfall by GSMaP and compared it with the threshold value of JMA. But there are only 9-year GSMaP data used in this study. The number of sample is too little to calculate return period. We have also added the data at the surrounding grids. We tried to increase the number of samples in this way. GSMaP has several problems. One of that’s GSMaP mistakes snow for rainfall. So we grasped the characteristics of such case. And we made the mask to take such case. When we calculate with the mask, the abnormal values has decreased. We improved stability of calculation return period with these ways.",

            "abstract": "Understanding, quantifying and attributing the impacts of climatic extreme events and variability is crucial for societal adaptation in a changing climate. However, climate model simulations generated for this purpose typically exhibit pronounced biases in their output that hinders any straightforward assessment of impacts. To overcome this issue, various bias correction strategies are routinely used to alleviate climate model deficiencies most of which have been criticized for physical inconsistency and the non-preservation of the multivariate correlation structure. We assess how biases and their correction affect the quantification and attribution of simulated extremes and variability in i) climatological variables and ii) impacts on ecosystem functioning as simulated by a terrestrial biosphere model.\nOur study demonstrates that assessments of simulated climatic extreme events and impacts in the terrestrial biosphere are highly sensitive to bias correction schemes with major implications for the detection and attribution of these events. We introduce a novel ensemble-based resampling scheme based on a large regional climate model ensemble generated by the distributed weather@home setup[1], which fully preserves the physical consistency and multivariate correlation structure of the model output. We use extreme value statistics to show that this procedure considerably improves the representation of climatic extremes and variability. Subsequently, biosphere-atmosphere carbon fluxes are simulated using a terrestrial ecosystem model (LPJ-GSI) to further demonstrate the sensitivity of ecosystem impacts to the methodology of bias correcting climate model output.\nWe find that uncertainties arising from bias correction schemes are comparable in magnitude to model structural and parameter uncertainties. The present study consists of a first attempt to alleviate climate model biases in a physically consistent way and demonstrates that this yields improved simulations of climate extremes and associated impacts.\n\n[1] http://www.climateprediction.net/weatherathome/",

            "abstract": "The rise in seismicity in Oklahoma since 2008 provides an unusual opportunity to study fluid migration and the interaction of fluids with faults. One unique area in north-central Oklahoma is a current seismic gap between large clusters in northern and central Oklahoma, providing a window into the temporal evolution of local seismicity. The gap in seismicity occurs across the NNE-SSW trending Nemaha uplift, with long faults relatively well-oriented in the regional stress field. Wastewater disposal occurs both within and on either side of the gap, and seismicity approached both sides of the uplift in 2014. To record seismicity and seismic migration through time within the uplift and along the bounding faults on either side, we deployed a ten station array of broadband sensors in April 2015. Our goal is to detect possible seismic signals related to fluid pressure migration and to ultimately increase our understanding of the fault response to perturbations in fluid pressure. Here we present local earthquake locations from the first months of data and initial focal mechanisms. We detect higher numbers of earthquakes happening within the Nemaha uplift than recorded in existing catalogs. The seismicity is typically <M2 and occurs near injection wells, suggesting that increased fluid pressure within the fault zone is characterized by higher frequencies of low magnitude events. This pattern of seismicity may represent deformation on small faults as the pressure perturbation migrates into the Nemaha uplift from either side and away from wells within the uplift.",

EIS combines narrow-angle and wide-angle cameras (NAC and WAC) designed to address high-priority Europa science and reconnaissance goals. It will: (A) Characterize the ice shell by constraining its thickness and correlating surface features with subsurface structures detected by ice penetrating radar; (B) Constrain formation processes of surface features and the potential for current activity by characterizing endogenic structures, surface units, global cross-cutting relationships, and relationships to Europa's subsurface structure, and by searching for evidence of recent activity, including potential plumes; and (C) Characterize scientifically compelling landing sites and hazards by determining the nature of the surface at scales relevant to a potential lander.\nThe NAC provides very high-resolution, stereo reconnaissance, generating 2-km-wide swaths at 0.5-m pixel scale from 50-km altitude, and uses a gimbal to enable independent targeting. NAC observations also include: near-global (>95%) mapping of Europa at ≤50-m pixel scale (to date, only ~14% of Europa has been imaged at ≤500 m/pixel, with best pixel scale 6 m); regional and high-resolution stereo imaging at <1-m/pixel; and high-phase-angle observations for plume searches.\nThe WAC is designed to acquire pushbroom stereo swaths along flyby ground-tracks, generating digital topographic models with 32-m spatial scale and 4-m vertical precision from 50-km altitude. These data support characterization of cross-track clutter for radar sounding. The WAC also performs pushbroom color imaging with 6 broadband filters (350-1050 nm) to map surface units and correlations with geologic features and topography.\nEIS will provide comprehensive data sets essential to fulfilling the goal of exploring Europa to investigate its habitability and perform collaborative science with other investigations, including cartographic and geologic maps, regional and high-resolution digital topography, GIS products, color and photometric data products, a geodetic control network tied to radar altimetry, and a database of plume-search observations.",

Across the Caribbean, many MIS 5e reefs are exposed above modern sea level, and have been studied extensively to understand sea level and ice sheet dynamics during an interglacial climate. This study investigates potential evidence for sub-orbital sea-level oscillations in the limestone Falmouth Formation from the northern and southwestern coastlines of Jamaica, a tectonically active island on the northern boundary of the Caribbean Plate.\nVertical exposures of MIS 5e reefs contain multiple facies transitions that are sometimes associated with sharp unconformities. Outcrops at East Rio Bueno contain a distinct change in coral taxonomy from an assemblage of in situ Montastraea spp., Siderastrea and Diploria sp. encrusted by coralline algae, next to a repeated succession of Porites furcata, Acropora cervicornis, coralline algae and Porites astreoides, to in situ P. furcata. This is overlain by a fining-upwards sequence of coral rubble, a laterally persistent layer of small in situ Siderastrea and a ~1-m thick caprock. Near Oracabessa, a unit dominated by Acropora palmata clearly transitions into in situ Montastraea spp., Siderastrea, Colpophyllia natans, and Diploria sp. overlain by A. cervicornis. An abrupt vertical displacement of the sequence, indicating faulting, was observed at Oracabessa. Along the south coast, transitions in coral assemblages were also noted upsection. Common facies observed include in situ A. palmata and/or rubble, with a trend of reduction in algal encrustation upsection, capped by head corals and a regressive beach unit.\nThe structure and composition of reefs preserved in the Falmouth Formation provide detailed information about sea-level behavior during MIS 5e, that will be used to test the hypothesis that sub-orbital sea-level oscillations occurred during the MIS 5e highstand. Evidence of tectonic activity along portions of the northern coastline indicates that those areas are unreliable for determining absolute past sea-level position.",

            "abstract": "Metabolic pathway activities at low temperature are not well understood, despite the fact that the processes are relevant for many soils globally and seasonally.\nTo analyze soil metabolism at low temperature, isotopomeres of position-specifically 13C labeled glucose were applied at three temperature levels; +5, -5 -20 oC. In additon, one sterilization treatment with sodium azide at +5 oC was also performed. Soils were incubated for 1, 3 and 10 days while soil samples at -20 oC were additionally sampled after 30 days. The 13C from individual molecule position in respired CO2 was quantifed. Incorporation of 13C in bulk soil, extractable microbial biomass by chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE) and cell membranes of different microbial communities classified by 13C phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) was carried out.\nOur 13CO2 data showed a dominance of C-1 respiration at +5 °C for treatments with and without sodium azide, but total respiration for sodium azide inhibited treatments increased by 14%. In contrast, at -5 and -20 oC metabolic behavior showed intermingling of preferential respiration of the glucose C-4 and C-1 positions. Therefore, at +5 °C, pentose phosphate pathway activity is a dominant metabolic pathway used by microorganisms to metabolize glucose. The respiration increase due to NaN3 inhibition was attributed to endoenzymes released from dead organisms that are stabilized at the soil matrix and have access to suitable substrate and co-factors to permit their funtions. Our PLFA analysis showed that incorporation of glucose 13C was higher in Gram negative bacteria than other microbial groups as they are most competitive for LMWOS. Only a limited amount of microbial groups maintained their glucose utilizing activity at -5 and -20 °C and they strongly shifted towards a metabolization of glucose via both glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways indicating both growth and cellular maintenance. This study revealed a remarkable microbial acitivity at low temperatures which differs significantly from our observations at ambient temperature, which could be unraveled based on position-specific labeling.",

            "abstract": "The National Weather Service (NWS) has been working for several years on the development of the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS). The objective of HEFS is to provide ensemble river forecasts incorporating the best precipitation and temperature forcings at any specific time horizon. For the current implementation, this includes the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2).\nOne of the core partners that has been working with the NWS since the beginning of the development phase of HEFS is the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) which is responsible for the complex water supply system for New York City. The water supply system involves a network of reservoirs in both the Delaware and Hudson River basins.\nAt the same time that the NWS was developing HEFS, NYCDEP was working on enhancing the operations of their water supply reservoirs through the development of a new Operations Support Tool (OST). OST is designed to guide reservoir system operations to ensure an adequate supply of high-quality drinking water for the city, as well as to meet secondary objectives for reaches downstream of the reservoirs assuming the primary water supply goals can be met. These secondary objectives include fisheries and ecosystem support, enhanced peak flow attenuation beyond that provided natively by the reservoirs, salt front management, and water supply for other cities.\nSince January 2014, the NWS Northeast and Middle Atlantic River Forecast Centers have provided daily one year forecasts from HEFS to NYCDEP. OST ingests these forecasts, couples them with near-real-time environmental and reservoir system data, and drives models of the water supply system. The input of ensemble forecasts results in an ensemble of model output, from which information on the range and likelihood of possible future system states can be extracted. This type of probabilistic information provides system managers with additional information not available from deterministic forecasts and allows managers to better assess risk, and provides greater context for decision-making than has been available in the past. HEFS has allowed NYCDEP water supply managers to make better decisions on reservoir operations than they likely would have in the past, using only deterministic forecasts.",

We also developed a Minimum cloud Information Deviation Profiling Method (MIDPM) as a method for a construction of 3D cloud field with MODIS/AQUA and CPR/CloudSat data. We then selected a  best-matched radar reflectivity factor profile from the library for each of off-nadir pixels of MODIS where CPR profile is not available, by minimizing the deviation between library MODIS parameters and those at the pixel.\n In this study, we have used three cloud microphysical parameters as key parameters for the MIDPM, i.e. effective particle radius, cloud optical thickness and top of cloud temperature, and estimated 3D cloud radiation budget. We examined the discrepancies between satellite observed and mode-simulated radiances and three cloud microphysical parameter’s pattern for studying the effects of cloud optical and microphysical properties on the radiation budget of the cloud-laden atmospheres.",

Since the basin has been regulated between 1973-1979 the catchment area was reduced from 146km² to 35 km². There are currently plans for further expansion by also incorporating Skykjedalsvatnet, the last major remaining lake in the basin of Simaelva. In Simadal there are known to be large amounts of ground water, a greater understanding of how the groundwater interacts the river water is desirable in terms of water flow, residence time and water chemistry.\nThroughout the autumn of 2013 and winter of 2014 loggers were placed at various measuring points to log temperature and water levels. This included six loggers that measure temperature and pressure, as well as three loggers that measure only temperature. The goal with these loggers was to locate springs and monitor water level changes over a one-year period. In order to further investigate the water quality of the different measurement points, monthly water samples as well as pH-, and conductivity measurements were conducted. The water samples were analyzed for major ions as well as metal ions. The latter was based on earlier reported high copper levels. Flow measurements have been made in the upper and lower parts of Simadal during dry periods. The work has also included the accomplishment of Quaternary mapping; analysis of aerial photography; and using GPR.\nOur main concern has been to map the water resources in Simadal by registering groundwater and springs in sediments and rock faces. Furthermore, it has been desirable to draw lines to a larger regional knowledge based water management. It seems to be important to maintain a certain minimum of water of good quality, both for the ecology of the river in general, but perhaps especially considering the sustainable sea trout populations found in Simaelva today. Previous chemical, hydrogeological and fish biology surveys of Simadal have been conducted which we aim to complement.",

Recent studies have led to new conceptual and quantitative models for sedimentary architecture in fluvial deposits over a range of scales that are relevant to CO2 injection and storage, led to new geocellular modelling approaches for representing this architecture, and led to new computational studies of CO2 plume dynamics during and after injection. The processes of CO2 trapping depend upon a complex system of non-linear and hysteretic characteristic relationships including how relative permeability and capillary pressure vary with brine and CO2 saturation. New computational studies of capillary trapping in conglomeratic reservoirs strongly suggest that representing small-scale (decimeter to meter) textural facies among different rock types, including their organization within a hierarchy of larger-scale stratification, representing differences in characteristic relationships between rock types, and representing hysteresis in characteristic curves can all be critical to understanding trapping processes. In this context, CO2trapping was evaluated in conglomeratic reservoirs with fluvial architecture including different rock types with different and hysteretic characteristic curves and with capillary pressure defined for each rock type using two different conventional approaches, i.e. Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten. The results show that in these reservoirs the capillary trapping rates are quite sensitive to differences between the Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten approaches, and that heterogeneity and hysteresis in characteristic relationships must both be represented in either case.",

            "abstract": "The study of the chemical composition of aerosol particles in the Amazon forest represents a step forward to understand the strong coupling between the atmosphere and the forest. For this reason submicron aerosol particles were investigated in the Amazon forest, where biogenic and anthropogenic aerosol particles coexist at the different seasons (wet/dry). The measurements were performed at the ATTO station, which is located about 150 km northeast of Manaus. At ATTO station the Aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM, Aerodyne) and the Multiangle absorption photometer (MAAP, Thermo 5012) have been operated continuously from March 2014 to July 2015. In this study, long-term measurements (near-real-time, ~30 minutes) of PM1 chemical composition were investigated for the first time in this environment.The wet season presented lower concentrations than the dry season (~5 times). In terms of chemical composition, both seasons were dominated by organics (75 and 63%) followed by sulfate (11 and 13%). Nitrate presented different ratio values between the mass-to-charges 30 to 46 (main nitrate fragments) suggesting the presence of nitrate as inorganic and organic nitrate during both seasons. The results indicated that about 75% of the nitrate signal was from organic nitrate during the dry season. In addition, several episodes with elevated amount of chloride, likely in the form of sea-salt from the Atlantic Ocean, were observed during the wet season. During those episodes, chloride comprised up to 7% of the PM1. During the dry season, chloride was also observed; however, with different volatility, which suggested that Chloride was present in different form and source. Moreover, the constant presence of sulfate and BC during the wet season might be related to biomass burning emissions from Africa. BC concentration was 2.5 times higher during the dry season. Further characterization of the organic fraction was accomplished with the positive matrix factorization (PMF), which revealed four different organic aerosol components with very distinct chemical characteristics for the dry season and three for the wet season.",

Therefore, radioactive wastes must be isolated from the living environment for millennia. A deep geological disposal entails a combination of four parts: vitrified waste form, imaginary zone, buffer zone and excavation-affected zone. The buffer zone constituted by bentonite clay provides a high level of containment of the radioactivity in the wastes over a very long time period. Analytical solution is an efficient tool for the performance evaluation of the buffer zone. This study develops a new analytical model to diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinate for describing radionuclide transport in the buffer zone. The derived solution is compared against the previous solution to illustrate the validity of previous solution which was derived using a diffusion equation in Cartesian coordinates.",

            "abstract": "Large subduction earthquake have repeatedly occurred along the Sumatra and Andaman subduction zones where the Indo-Australia plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian plate. We have analyzed earthquake data from local seismic network along the Sumatra region that provided by the Meteorology Climatology Geophysical Agencies of Indonesia (MCGAI), giving a reliable P-wave velocity model by using joint inversion of picked P-wave travel time using VELEST and a re-scanned single channel seismic reflection of Sumatra cruise I and II. As much as 1,503 events are being analyzed, that is from two years and three months of data recording (2009/04 – 2011/07). The VELEST and DD technique are used to relocate all events by forcing the obtained velocity model. It is found that the surface deformation and earthquake cluster are strongly influenced by the impact of an N – S subparalel fracture zone along the Indo-Australia plate. This also explains the seismic gaps along the Sumatra and Andaman subduction zones.\nSo far, the intriguing seismogenic behaviour and forearc structure are not well explained by the existing models. Therefore, the planned IODP Expedition 362 is trying to ground truth the scientific questions. The aftershock earthquake data are huge, but they will provide a gateway to help the understanding of this shallow megathrust slip and reduce its devastated harzards.",

Only a single hindcast was done on the 7-km mesh, but an ensemble hindcast composed of 6 members, which were initialized at different dates with one day intervals, were achieved on the 14-km mesh. Several sensitivity tests were performed on the 14-km mesh to examine influences from time evolution of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The main conclusion from those sensitivity tests will be discussed.

            "abstract": "Pollen exposure and prevalence of allergenic diseases have increased in many parts of the world during the last 30 years, with exposure to aeroallergen grass pollen expected to intensify with climate change, raising increased concerns for allergic diseases. The primary contributing factors to higher allergenic plant species presence are thought to be climate change, land conversion, and biotic mixing of species. Conventional methods for monitoring airborne pollen are hampered by a lack of sampling sites and heavily rely on meteorology with less attention to land cover updates and monitoring of key allergenic species phenology stages. Satellite remote sensing offers an alternative method to overcome the restrictive coverage afforded by in situ pollen networks by virtue of its synoptic coverage and repeatability of measurements that enable timely updates of land cover and land use information and monitoring landscape dynamics and interactions with human activity and climate. In this study, we assessed the potential of satellite observations of urban/peri-urban environments to directly inform landscape conditions conducive to pollen emissions. We found satellite measurements of grass cover phenological evolution to be highly correlated with in situ aerobiological grass pollen concentrations in five urban centres located across two hemispheres (Australia and France). Satellite greenness data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were found to be strongly synchronous with grass pollen aerobiology in both temperate grass dominated sites (France and Melbourne), as well as in Sydney, where multiple pollen peaks coincided with the presence of subtropical grasses. Employing general additive models (GAM), the satellite phenology data provided strong predictive capabilities to inform airborne pollen levels and forecast periods of grass pollen emissions at all five sites. Satellite phenology offer promising opportunities of improving public health risk management through dissemination of timely data for use in public health action and alerts and to minimise the impact of these common chronic conditions.",

            "abstract": "In this work we present HYDROSCAPE, an innovative streamflow routing method based on the travel time approach, and modeled through a fine-scale geomorphological description of hydrological flow paths. The model is designed aimed at being easily coupled with weather forecast or climate models providing the hydrological forcing, and at the same time preserving the geomorphological dispersion of the river network, which is kept unchanged independently on the grid size of rainfall input. This makes HYDROSCAPE particularly suitable for multi-scale applications, ranging from medium size catchments up to the continental scale, and to investigate the effects of extreme rainfall events that require an accurate description of basin response timing. Key feature of the model is its computational efficiency, which allows performing a large number of simulations for sensitivity/uncertainty analyses in a Monte Carlo framework. Further, the model is highly parsimonious, involving the calibration of only three parameters: one defining the residence time of hillslope response, one for channel velocity, and a multiplicative factor accounting for uncertainties in the identification of the potential maximum soil moisture retention in the SCS-CN method.\nHYDROSCAPE is designed with a simple and flexible modular structure, which makes it particularly prone to massive parallelization, customization according to the specific user needs and preferences (e.g., rainfall-runoff model), and continuous development and improvement. Finally, the possibility to specify the desired computational time step and evaluate streamflow at any location in the domain, makes HYDROSCAPE an attractive tool for many hydrological applications, and a valuable alternative to more complex and highly parametrized large scale hydrological models.\nTogether with model development and features, we present an application to the Upper Tiber River basin (Italy), providing a practical example of model performance and characteristics.",

Lower thermospheric temperatures will be determined from the spectral shape of the molecular oxygen atmospheric emission band around λ=762nm.\nTwo identical MIGHTI interferometers, oriented on the spacecraft to view a common atmospheric volume, obtain orthogonal line of sight wind information. Both instruments use the Doppler Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne (DASH) approach with low order Echelle gratings optimized for the red, green, and near infrared wavelengths detected by MIGHTI.\nIn March 2015 the MIGHTI design was formally finalized at the Critical Design Review and the integration and test of an engineering unit was completed.

By using a three-dimensional dipole wave model, We study how ULF waves are affected by such north-south asymmetry. Firstly, we present how odd and even harmonics of both toroidal and poloidal modes are excited respectively when N-S asymmetry gradually increases. Our initial results are compared to the previous studies of magnetoseismology. Secondly, we show how ULF waves are excited by assuming various asymmetric field-aligned models. While magnetic geometry remains symmetric, asymmetry is introduced owing to field-aligned inhomogeneity and/or differential ionospheric conductivities. It is shown that field-aligned asymmetry highly enhances the damping process of poloidal modes and reduces their lifetime by the mismatch between symmetric bounce-drift motion and asymmetric field-aligned mode structure. The time-dependent feature is examined at different locations including the equatorial region. In addition, we discuss about the minimal conditions that support the excitation of the poloidal modes associated with wave-particle interaction.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms drive the transformations of carbon compounds in the terrestrial subsurface, a key reservoir of carbon on earth, and impact other linked biogeochemical cycles. Our current knowledge of the microbial ecology in this environment is primarily based on 16S rRNA gene sequences that paint a biased picture of microbial community composition and provide no reliable information on microbial metabolism. Consequently, little is known about the identity and metabolic roles of the uncultivated microbial majority in the subsurface. In turn, this lack of understanding of the microbial processes that impact the turnover of carbon in the subsurface has restricted the scope and ability of biogeochemical models to capture key aspects of the carbon cycle.\nIn this study, we used a culture-independent, genome-resolved metagenomic approach to decipher the metabolic capabilities of microorganisms in an aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River, near Rifle, CO, USA. We sequenced groundwater and sediment samples collected across fifteen different geochemical regimes. Sequence assembly, binning and manual curation resulted in the recovery of 2,542 high-quality genomes, 27 of which are complete. These genomes represent 1,300 non-redundant organisms comprising both abundant and rare community members. Phylogenetic analyses involving ribosomal proteins and 16S rRNA genes revealed the presence of up to 34 new phyla that were hitherto unknown. Less than 11% of all genomes belonged to the 4 most commonly represented phyla that constitute 93% of all currently available genomes. Genome-specific analyses of metabolic potential revealed the co-occurrence of important functional traits such as carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation and use of electron donors and electron acceptors. Finally, we predict that multiple organisms are often required to complete redox pathways through a complex network of metabolic handoffs that extensively cross-link subsurface biogeochemical cycles.",

The 79°N Glacier is feed by two branches, one southern coming from the North East Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) and one northern branch.\nWe have applied a flux routing type of hydrological model to this area prior to an airborne ice penetrating radar campaign that has been carried out in June 2015. Flux routing scheme can be used to distribute the basal water down the static hydraulic potential. In this study, local sinks in the potential field were filled using a priority flooding approach, which allows a more realistic continuation of water flow across the sinks.\nOne distinct sink was found in the NEGIS branch, indicating a potential lake location. In the northern branch, the water flux appeared to be concentrated with a clear transition to a potentially dry area. We show the subglacial water fluxes for constant basal melt rates, as well as for spatially varying melt rates taken from the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). Using the PISM output allows assessing the likely drainage pathways with a more realistic availability of water. The airborne campaign was covering cross sections over these two locations, of which we will present the radar sections.",

TOROS2 *1Istanbul University, Turkey, kanli@istanbul.edu.tr, 2Geological and Geophysical Institute of Hungary,3MinGeo, Hungary\nThe Ferenc Channel is one of the main irrigation and ship channel in south of Hungary, existing from 1801. The water level is controlled by the Deák Ferenc Sluice in the channel which was constructed in 1875. At that time, the sluice was unique in Europe with its two channels and brick-walls. The west channel was used for controlling the amount of water and the east channel was used for shipping. In the study, before starting to the restoration and reinforcement plannings at the sluice, non-destructive geophysical investigations were executed. In the first stage, ultra-high frequency seismic (80 kHz) and acoustic (5 kHz) investigations of the floor slab were carried out from a boat on the water level. Due to the water level was approximately 2 m, we could use the advantage of the water ensuring very good coupling with seismic sensors for high frequency seismic and acoustic measurements. In the second stage, resistivity measurements were carried out in the eastern part of the sluice which was used as the shipping channel. Three profiles were measured to map the resistivity distribution of the slab. In the third stage, for better understanding the stability conditions of the walls and easy to compare with the data of GPR measurements, the wall of the sluice were investigated by a simple seismic direct wave method using seismic P-waves for mapping seismic velocities. The last stage of the survey was the GPR measurements that were carried out both on the walls and on the slab of the sluice. During the investigation, the channels were empty and without water. The integrated survey and the interpretation of the results showed us that there were some faults, cracks and voids in the slab existed in the whole grossness of the slab and the brick walls were builded from inhomogenous construction material. Integrated geophysical surveys provided optimum solutions for planning restoration and reinforcement work on this ancient and very old building structure.

The most recent solar minimum brought to light gaps in the current understanding of the relationship between ionospheric structure and solar irradiance. The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observes the high-latitude ionosphere using coherent scatter High Frequency (HF) radars. SuperDARN has been operational over one and a half solar cycles, and so provides an invaluable dataset for studying long-term ionospheric variability at the northern and southern poles. This study explores the influence of solar and magnetospheric forcing on HF ground-backscatter. Ground-backscatter, the backscatter that returns from a reflection point on the ground rather than from an ionospheric irregularity, provides a measure of the ionospheric density along the propagation path of the radar signal. By exploring the conditions that inhibit or enhance the propagation of ground-backscatter, we improve our understanding of the state of the bottomside ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Air pollution is the number one environmental cause of premature deaths in Europe. Despite extensive regulations, air pollution remains a challenging issue, especially in urban areas. For studying air quality in the Berlin-Brandenburg region of Germany the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is set up and evaluated against meteorological and air quality observations from monitoring stations as well as from a field campaign conducted in 2014 (incl. black carbon, VOCs as well as mobile measurements of particle size distribution and particle mass). The model setup includes 3 nested domains with horizontal resolutions of 15km, 3km, and 1km, online biogenic emissions using MEGAN 2.0, and anthropogenic emissions from the TNO-MACC-II inventory.\nThis work serves as a basis for future studies on different aspects of air pollution in the Berlin-Brandenburg region, including how heat waves affect emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from urban vegetation (summer 2006) and the impact of selected traffic measures on air quality in the Berlin-Brandenburg area (summer 2014).\nThe model represents the meteorology as observed in the region well for both periods. An exception is the heat wave period in 2006, where the temperature simulated with 3km and 1km resolutions is biased low by around 2°C for urban built-up stations.\nFirst results of simulations with chemistry show that, on average, WRF-Chem simulates concentrations of O3 well. However, the 8 hr maxima are underestimated, and the minima are overestimated. While NOx daily means are modeled reasonably well for urban stations, they are overestimated for suburban stations. PM10 concentrations are underestimated by the model. The biases and correlation coefficients of simulated O3, NOx, and PM10 in comparison to surface observations do not show improvements for the 1km domain in comparison to the 3km domain.\nTo improve the model performance of the 1km domain we will include an updated emission inventory (TNO-MACC-III) as well as the interpolation of the emission data from 7km to a 1km resolution.",

            "abstract": "It has been established that the Sweet-Parker current layer in high Lundquist number reconnection is unstable to the super-Alfvénic plasmoid instability. Past two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that the plasmoid instability leads to a new regime where the Sweet-Parker current layer changes into a chain of plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets, and the averaged reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of the Lundquist number. In this work, three-dimensional simulations with a guide field shows that the additional degree of freedom allows plasmoid instabilities to grow at oblique angles. We present a scenario in which large-scale oblique tearing modes overlap with each other, break flux surfaces, and stir up a spectrum of smaller-scale tearing modes, leading eventually to self-generated turbulent reconnection. The averaged reconnection rate in the self-generated turbulent state is of the order of a hundredth of the characteristic Alfvén speed, which is similar to the two-dimensional result but is an order of magnitude lower than the fastest reconnection rate reported in recent studies of externally driven three-dimensional turbulent reconnection. Kinematic and magnetic energy fluctuations both form elongated eddies along the direction of local magnetic field, which is a signature of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Both energy fluctuations satisfy power-law spectra in the inertial range. The anisotropy of turbulence eddies is found to be nearly scale-independent, in contrast with the prediction of the Goldreich-Sridhar (GS) theory for anisotropic turbulence in a homogeneous plasma permeated by a uniform magnetic field. The effect of varying the magnitude of the toroidal field on the critical balance condition underlying the GS theory is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The northern part of the South China Sea is characterized by wide-spread occurrence of bottom simulating reflectors (BSR), indicating the presence of marine gas hydrates. Because the area covers both the tectonically inactive passive margin and the northern termination of the Manila Trench subduction zone while sediment input is broadly similar, this area provides an excellent opportunity to study the influence of tectonic processes on the dynamics of gas hydrate systems. Long-offset multi-channel seismic data show that movement along thrust faults and blind thrust faults caused anticlinal ridges on the active margin, while faults are absent on the passive margin. This coincides with high-hydrate saturations derived from ocean bottom seismometer data and controlled source electromagnetic data, and conspicuous high-amplitude reflections in P-Cable 3D seismic data above the BSR in the anticlinal ridges of the active margin. On the contrary, all geophysical evidence for the passive margin points to normal- to low-hydrate saturations. Geochemical analysis of gas samples collected at seep sites on the active margin show methane with heavy δ13C isotope composition, while gas collected on the passive margin shows highly depleted (light) carbon isotope composition. Thus, we interpret the passive margin as a typical gas hydrate province fuelled by biogenic production of methane and the active margin gas hydrate system as a system that is fuelled not only by biogenic gas production but also by additional advection of thermogenic methane from the subduction system. The location of the highest gas hydrate saturations in the hanging wall next to the thrust faults suggests that the thrust faults represent pathways for the migration of methane. Our findings suggest that the most promising gas hydrate occurrences for exploitation of gas hydrate as an energy source may be found in the core of the active margin roll over anticlines immediately above the BSR and that high-amplitude reflections in the seismic reflection data may be a good proxy for these targets.",

            "abstract": "Seismological observations of the ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) suggest the presence of partial melts above the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Knowledge of the melting relations in the lower mantle is a key to understanding the chemical differentiation at the base of the mantle. While melting relations of mantle materials at relatively low pressures (below 30 GPa) have been extensively studied using a multi-anvil apparatus (e.g. Ito et al., 2004 Phy. Earth Planet. Inter.), melting experiments at higher pressures are still limited. Only a few model compositions, such as peridotite and mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), were studied under the CMB conditions using a laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC) (e.g. Fiquet et al., 2010 Science, Andrault et al., 2014 Science). Since chemical heterogeneity of both major elements (Mg, Si, Fe, Al...) and minor ones (e.g. alkalis and volatiles) should have a large effect on the melting behavior, the melting phase diagrams as a function of composition are fundamental to understand the nature of the ULVZs. For melting relations in a binary system MgO-MgSiO3, which is a major component in the lower mantle, previous experiments were performed up to only 26 GPa (Liebske and Frost, 2012 Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.). Further studies at higher pressures corresponding to the deep lower mantle conditions are required. In this study, we have determined the melting relations in the MgO-MgSiO3 system above 30 GPa using a LHDAC. Glasses of several different compositions in the MgO-MgSiO3 system (from 37 to 45 mol% SiO2) were used as starting materials. A double-sided CO2 laser heating system was used to heat the sample directly. The recovered samples were polished and analyzed by a dualbeam focused ion beam (FIB) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), respectively. The eutectic compositions and the liquidus phases were determined on the basis of chemical and textural analysis of the quenched samples. Our results show that the eutectic composition at 30 GPa is about 42%, consistent with previous results by Liebske and Frost (2012). It becomes about 41% at 60 GPa, and more MgO-rich with increasing pressure. The present result should provide a baseline for a better understanding of the effects of other components on the melting relations of the mantle materials at deep mantle conditions.",

            "abstract": "Flood, a hydrological extreme, is a dominant and frequent phenomena over the eastern Ganga Plains comprising of alluvial plains of Bihar and adjoining Nepal Himalaya. Flood affects major parts of Bihar where Gandak and Koshi are the major tributaries of Ganga River causing inundation during the monsoon season. Due to heavy rainfall in the Eastern Himalaya and adjoining regions, the river discharge increases several folds causing severe flood in plains. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived data at 250 m resolution (year 2000-2015) have been used to identify flood water and calculate daily water fraction (water cover) using model adopted from previous studies. During the monsoon season, cloud cover in daily images is found to be extremely high leading to lot of gaps in the form of missing data. To account for missing grid cell values, an adaptive polynomial filter (Savitzky-Golay) have been used to fit the time series of daily data for each grid cell. The missing values in daily images have been filled with calculated values to create daily time series of flood water. Landsat data at 30 m grid resolution have been used to verify flood water detection algorithm used in this study. Time series analysis of satellite derived data reveal a strong spatial and temporal variation in the extent, duration and frequency (inter-annual and intra-annual) of flooding event over the study region. Statistical analysis of IDF (intensity, duration, and frequency) and trend have been carried out to identify regions which show greater flood risk. Reoccurrence interval and length of flooding event in the study region is found to be high compared to other river basins in the western India. Based on the historical occurrence of flood, the study area have been classified into different flood hazard zones where flood mitigation and management need to be prioritized. MODIS based flood monitoring and mapping model used in this study can be used for monitoring and assessment of flooding events in near-real time over the study region.",

            "abstract": "Subduction on Earth is one-sided, where one oceanic plate sinks beneath the overriding plate. However, subduction zones in most numerical models tends to develop two-sided subduction, where both plates sink to the mantle. In this study, we use numerical model to find out how the existence of low viscosity wedge (LVW) can enable single-sided subduction and affects the flow in the subduction system.At the mantle wedge, water released from dehydrated oceanic crust serpentinized the mantle, which forms the LVW. LVW is an important part of the subduction system and provides efficient lubricant between the subducting slab and overriding lithosphere.\nSingle-sided subduction can be generated in numerical models by different techniques, including prescribed plate velocity, non-Newtonian rheology, and free surface. These techniques either requires kinematic boundary condition, which produce mantle flow inconsistent with the buoyancy, or costs great amount of computational resources when solving nonlinear equations. In this study, we tried to generating single-sided subduction with Newtonian viscosity and free slip surface. A set of tracers representing hydrated oceanic crust are placed near the surface. As the tracers subducted with the lithosphere, we assume that the oceanic crust becomes dehydrated and serpentinizes the mantle wedge above. A parameterized LVW is placed above the subducted tracers in the models. We test with different upper/lower depth limits of the LVW and the viscosity of the LVW. Both overriding plate and subducting plate's surface velocity relative to the trench is calculated in order to determine whether the subduction is one-sided.\nResults of our numerical models show that not only the low viscosity wedge above the slab is essential for the formation of one-side subduction, a low viscosity layer in between two tectonic plates is also needed to provide the slab efficient lubricant after the subduction started. On the other hand, the plate's age, which effects the plate's thickness and viscosity, strongly influence the speed of subduction. ",

            "abstract": "Global warming is enhanced at high northern latitudes where the Arctic surface air\ntemperature has risen at twice the rate of the global average in recent decades - a\nfeature called Arctic amplification. This recent Arctic warming signal likely results\nfrom several factors such as the albedo feedback due to a diminishing cryosphere,\nenhanced poleward atmospheric and oceanic transport, and change in humidity. Moreover, Arctic\nsummer sea-ice extent has declined by more than 10% per decade since the start of\nthe satellite era (e.g. Stroeve et al., 2012), culminating in a new record low in\nSeptember 2012.\nEurasian snow cover changes have been suggested as a driver for changes in the\nArctic Oscillation and might provide a link between sea ice decline in the Arctic\nduring summer and atmospheric circulation in the following winter. However, the\nmechanism connecting snow cover in Eurasia to sea ice decline in autumn is still\nunder debate.\nOur analysis focuses on sea ice decline in the Barents-Kara Sea region, which allows\nus to specify regions of interest for FLEXPART forward and backwards moisture\ntrajectories. Based on Eularian and Lagrangian diagnostics from ERA-INTERIM, we\ncan address the origin and cause of late autumn snow depth variations in a dense\n(snow observations from 820 land stations), unutilized observational datasets over the\nCommonwealth of Independent States.\nOpen waters in the Barents and Kara Sea have been shown to increase the diabatic\nheating of the atmosphere, which amplifies baroclinic cyclones and might induce a\nremote atmospheric response by triggering stationary Rossby waves (Honda et al.\n2009).\nIn agreement with these studies, our results show enhanced storm activity originating\nat the Barents and Kara with disturbances entering the continent through a small\nsector from the Barents and Kara Seas. Maxima in storm activity trigger increasing uplift, often\naccompanied by positive snowfall and snow depth anomalies.\nWe show that declining sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas acts as moisture source\nfor enhanced Siberian snow cover as a result of changed tropospheric moisture\ntransport. Transient disturbances enter the continent from the Barents and Kara Seas\nregion, related to anomalies in the planetary wave pattern and move southward along\nthe Ural mountains.",

            "abstract": "The mass of hydrocarbons that have migrated through tight-gas-sandstone systems before the permeability reduces to trap the hydrocarbon gases provides critical information in the hydrocarbon potential analysis of a basin. The noble gas content (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) of the groundwater has a unique isotopic and elemental composition. As gas migrates through the water column, the groundwater-derived noble gases partition into the hydrocarbon phase. Determination of the noble gases in the produced hydrocarbon phase then provides a record of the type of interaction (simple phase equilibrium or open system Rayleigh fractionation).\nThe tight-gas-sand reservoirs of the Rocky Mountains represent one of the most significant gas resources in the United States. The producing reservoirs are generally developed in low permeability (averaging <0.1mD) Upper Cretaceous fluvial to marginal marine sandstones and commonly form isolated overpressured reservoir bodies encased in even lower permeability muddy sediments. We present noble gas data from producing fields in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming; the the Piceance Basin, Colorado; and in the Uinta Basin, Utah. The data is consistent from all three basins. We show how in each basin the noble gases record open system gas migration through a water column at maximum basin burial. The data within an open system model indicates that the gas now in-place represents the last ~10% of hydrocarbon gas to have passed through the water column, most likely prior to permeability closedown.",

            "abstract": "Urban precipitation enhancement has been identified over many cities in India by previous studies conducted. Anthropogenic effects such as change in land cover from hilly forest areas to flat topography with solid concrete infrastructures has certain effect on the local weather, the same way the greenhouse gas has on climate change. Urbanization could alter the large scale forcings to such an extent that it may bring about temporal and spatial changes in the urban weather. The present study investigate the physical processes involved in urban forcings, such as the effect of sudden increase in wind velocity travelling through the channel space in between the dense array of buildings, which give rise to turbulence and air mass instability in urban boundary layer and in return alters the rainfall distribution as well as rainfall initiation. A numerical model study is conducted over Mumbai metropolitan city which lies on the west coast of India, to assess the effect of urban morphology on the increase in number of extreme rainfall events in specific locations. An attempt has been made to simulate twenty extreme rainfall events that occurred over the summer monsoon period of the year 2014 using high resolution WRF-ARW (Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research WRF) model to assess the urban land cover mechanisms that influences precipitation variability over this spatially varying urbanized region. The result is tested against simulations with altered land use. The correlation of precipitation with spatial variability of land use is found using a detailed urban land use classification. The initial and boundary conditions for running the model were obtained from the global model ECMWF(European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast) reanalysis data having a horizontal resolution of 0.75 °x 0.75°. The high resolution simulations show significant spatial variability in the accumulated rainfall, within a few kilometers itself. Understanding the spatial variability of precipitation will help in the planning and management of the built environment more efficiently.",

            "abstract": "Two Alvin dives (AL 4771 and 4774) transected the seafloor directly above the two largest Off-Axis Melt Lenses (O-AML) east of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis at 9 39’N and 9 54’N. In 2008, a 3D high-resolution seismic reflection survey (MGL-0812) discovered O-AMLs 3-7 km from the EPR at 2-3 km below the seafloor. Several other O-AML in the crust have been subsequently detected in several locations up to 20 km from the spreading axis at fast and intermediate spreading ridges; understanding their impacts is increasingly important. During the dives, no currently active hydrothermal venting or fresh lava was seen, suggesting that these features do not constantly power off-axis geological activity. However, the seafloor appears much younger at small volcanic seamounts in the 9 39’N than at the 9 54’N site. At 9 39’N, we used Alvin to explore the off-axis volcanic mound complex, reaching the summit of the three largest mounds. Although no evidence for on-going hydrothermal or volcanic activity was detected, the seafloor wore a thin sediment layer of ~10cm and thin Mn-coatings on 9 rock samples, suggesting volcanism more recently than would be expected based on the spreading-rate age of the crust. At 9 54’N, the Alvin trackline started south of a prominent abyssal hill, which has an unusual D-shape over 1 km wide in the center, crossed the abyssal hill, visited two local hummocks on top, and then attempted to find volcanic activity on the near slope of EPR axis by going as far west was possible during the dive. Heavy sediment everywhere on the abyssal hill, to the depth of push cores (~30 cm) and probably much deeper in many areas and 4 rock samples from the abyssal hill were quite weathered with little glass intact, suggest that this site is unaffected by the underlying O-AML. Upslope toward the EPR west of the abyssal hill, 4 rocks collected appear somewhat younger, and sediment became thinner. In addition, 3 CTD tow-yos over each O-AML found no evidence of active hydrothermal vents at either site. While these results do not support the idea of on-going and widespread volcanic activity associated with O-AMLs, a comprehensive survey may reveal smaller pockets of activity. A viable alternative is that off-axis activity is sparse and sporadic, perhaps focused by faults that tap into O-AML heat, and that O-AMLs warrant further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphic monitoring of river restoration projects is a critical component of measuring their success. In smaller streams, with depths less than 2 meters, one of the more difficult variables to map at high-resolution is bathymetry. In larger rivers, bathymetry can be measured with instruments like multi-beam sonar, bathymetric airborne LiDAR, or acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCP). However, these systems are often limited by their minimum operating depths, which makes them ineffective in shallow water. Remote sensing offers several potential solutions for collecting bathymetry, spectral depth mapping and photogrammetric measurement (e.g. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) multi-view photogrammetry). In this case study, we use SfM to produce both high-resolution above water topography and below water bathymetry for two reaches of a stream restoration project on the Middle Fork of the John Day River in eastern Oregon and one reach on the White River in Vermont. We collected low-allitude multispectral (RGB+NIR) aerial photography at all of the sites at altitudes of 30 to 50 meters. The SfM survey was georeferenced with RTK-GPS ground control points and the bathymetry was refraction-corrected using additional RTK-GPS sample points. The resulting raster data products have horizontal resolutions of ~4-8 centimeters for the topography and ~8-15 cm for the bathymetry. This methodology, like many fluvial remote sensing methods, will only work under ideal conditions (e.g. clear water), but it provides an additional tool for collecting high-resolution bathymetric datasets for geomorphic monitoring efforts.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests and savannas are among the most important biomes on Earth, supporting more than half of all plant and animal species on the planet. Despite growing interest in biogeochemical processes that affect tropical forest dynamics, many, including biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), are still poorly understood. Free-living N-fixers are thought to play a key role in tropical ecosystems, alleviating N and P limitation, supporting above and below ground biomass production, as well as carbon storage in plants and soil, but this influence has yet to be quantified. Of particular interest, the spatial distribution and identity of free-living BNF under disturbance regimes that commonly lead to the conversion of forests to savannas is currently unknown. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we measured free-living BNF quantifying rates of N fixation under contrasting fire regimes in the Amazon-Cerrado transition of central Brazil. Samples were collected in 4 ha of floodable forests affected by fire and 1 ha of unburned (seasonally flooded) forest located at the Araguaia State Park, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Free-living N-fixation rates were measured by both 15N2 (98 atom% 15N) and acethylene reduction assay (ARA). Samples were incubated in the field and left in the dark at room temperature for 12 hours. In the next few weeks we will quantify N fixation rates that will be presented in the upcoming AGU meeting.",

            "abstract": "Transport along riparian and hyporheic flowpaths is generally believed to integrate the responses of streams and aquifers to dynamic hydrological forcing. Although it is generally expected transport along these flow paths is time-variable, such dynamic responses have seldom been demonstrated. Further, we do not understand how hydrological forcing interacts with local geologic setting (i.e., valley and streambed morphology) We conducted a series of four stream solute tracer injections in each of two watersheds with contrasting valley morphology in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, monitoring tracer concentrations in the stream and in a network of shallow wells in each watershed. Time series analyses were used to deconvolve transport along subsurface flowpaths from transport in the stream channel. We found time-invariant hyporheic transport in the narrow, bedrock-constrained valley and near large roughness elements (e.g., steps, logs) in the wider valley bottom despite order of magnitude changes in discharge, suggesting geologic controls dominate hyporheic transport in these locations. In contrast, we observed increases in mean arrival time and temporal variance with decreasing discharge at the riparian-hillslope transition, suggesting hydrological dynamics control transport in these locations. We pose several mechanisms by which dynamic hydrology and geologic setting interact that may explain the observed behavior. We interpret time-invariant transport as an indication that discharge in the surface stream is a poor predictor of exchange along the stream-hyporheic-riparian-hillslope continuum in headwater valleys. As such, models able to account for the transition from geologically-dominated processes in the near-stream subsurface to hydrologically-dominated processes near the hillslope are required to predict transport and fate in valley bottoms of headwater mountain streams.",

            "abstract": "Multidecadal droughts are a prominent feature of the Common Era paleoclimate record in the American West, particularly during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. These megadroughts represent an important out-of-sample target for validating the ability of Coupled General Circulation Models to adequately characterize drought risk over the near-term future. Such model validations, however, require a substantially improved understanding of the atmosphere-ocean state during megadroughts. Here we use spatiotemporal tree-ring reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere hydroclimate to infer the atmosphere-ocean dynamics that underlie megadroughts, and find that these features are consistently associated with ten-to-thirty year periods of frequent cold conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, a prominent hypothesis that there were multiple centuries of persistently La Niña-like conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly is inconsistent with our analysis of the tree-ring reconstructions. Instead, warm conditions in the Atlantic likely played a necessary role in amplifying drying during this period. These results provide a framework for evaluating the performance of General Circulation Models, which simulate megadroughts under a range of different atmosphere-ocean states, including stochastic atmospheric variability, and clarify the dynamical mechanisms that will determine the risk of megadroughts in the future.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic changes associated with earthquakes have been investigated previously. Our research group has also employed the magnetometers for seismomagnetic observations since March 2004.\nOur observation site happened to be situated at an epicentral distance of 26 km from the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake ofM7.2, NE Japan. In this earthquake, we have reported successful observation of “co-faulting\" Earth’s magnetic field changes (Okubo et al., 2011 EPSL). Magnetic fields began to change almost simultaneously with the onset of the earthquake rupture and grew before the first P wave arrival. Such magnetic signals are most probably generated by the changing stress field due to earthquake rupturing, i.e. the piezomagnetic effect.\nOn the other hand, this observation result suggested that the geomagnetic variation signal accompanying fault movement, whose sources are the piezomagnetic effects, is very small. The observed change of geomagnetic field might be approximately less than several hundred pico-tesla.\nTherefore, to obtain more observation data of “co-faulting\" magnetic field change, development of a higher-sensitive magnetometer system is very important. Then, our research group tried to develop the HTS-SQUID (high-temperature-superconductor based superconducting-quantum-interference-device) magnetometer systems for high-resolution observation of Earth’s magnetic field. Since March 2012 we have introduced long-term precise geomagnetic observations using the HTS-SQUID magnetometer system Unit No.1 (mark I) at Iwaki observation site (IWK) in Fukushima, Japan. Additionally, since October 2014, we have also introduced the new HTS- SQUID magnetometer system Unit No.2 (mark II). The sampling interval of the magnetometers is 0.02 sec (50Hz). The system clock has been synchronized by use of GPS signals. A high-resolution accelerometer is also installed at observation point.\nIn this study, we show the observation results of geomagnetic field changes associated with the earthquake using our high-resolution HTS-SQUID magnetometer systems. Further efforts in the future would support a feasibility of a new system for a super-early warning of destructive earthquakes with the combined seismic-magnetic measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Community Land Model (CLM) land surface model has been used widely to evaluate biogeophysical responses to land cover and land use change. Here, we compare surface attributes collected from eddy covariance towers clusters to uncoupled point CLM (PTCLM) simulations. The tower clusters collect surface energy fluxes over adjacent forested and deforested land surface types located within 10-km of each other in temperate eastern North America. Summer surface albedo is very well simulated over cropland, C-3 grassland, and broadleaf deciduous temperate forests. In winter, modeled snow cover persists longer in spring than at the tower sites, resulting in higher average winter and spring albedo. Latent heat does not vary significantly among the three tower sites. PTCLM underestimates forest latent heat and overestimates cropland and grassland summer latent heat.\nWe evaluate temperature differences between forested and deforested sites due to changes in surface albedo, energy redistribution due to changes in surface roughness, and energy redistribution due to changes in latent and sensible heat partitioning (e.g., Bowen ratio). Surprisingly, temperature differences resulting from radiative forcing due to changes in surface albedo are relatively minor at the tower sites and generally too high in PTCLM. We conclude that the increased surface roughness of forests contributes strongly to nocturnal cooling over deforested tower sites in winter and daytime warming in summer. The importance of biogeophysical coupling between the land surface and atmosphere on energy redistribution due to surface roughness is explored using high-resolution (28-km) Variable Resolution Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) simulations.",

            "abstract": "Arctic and subarctic regions play important roles in the global carbon balance. However, nitrogen (N) deficiency is a major constraint for organic carbon sequestration in the High Arctic. Hence, the identification of the relative contributions from different N-sources is critical for understanding the constraints that limit tundra growth.\nThe stable nitrogen composition of the three main N-sources and numerous plants were analyzed in ten tundra types in the Fuglebekken catchment (Hornsund Fjord, Svalbard, 77°N 15°E). The percentage of the total tundra N-pool provided by seabirds’ feces (colonially breeding, planktivorous Alle alle), ranged from 0–21% in Patterned-ground tundra to 100% in Ornithocoprophilous tundra. The total N-pool utilized by tundra plants in the studied catchment was built in 36% by birds, 38% by atmospheric deposition, and 26% by N2-fixation. The results clearly show that N-pool in the tundra is significantly supplemented by nesting seabirds. Thus, if they experienced substantial negative environmental pressure associated with climate change, it would adversely influence the tundra N-budget [1].\nThe growth rates and the sediment thickness (<15 cm) in different tundra types varied considerably but the tundra age was similar, <450 cal BP. The only exception was Ornithocoprophilous tundra with very diverse ages ranging from 235 to 2300 cal BP and thickness up to 110cm. The growth rates for this tundra (62 cm core, 18 AMS 14C dates) were high (1.5-3.0 mm/yr) between 1568 and 1804 AD and then substantially declined for the period between 1804 and 1929 AD (0.2 mm/yr). These findings deliver an additional argument, that the organic matter accumulation is driven not only directly by climatic conditions but also by birds’ contribution to the tundra N-pool.\n[1] Skrzypek G, Wojtuń B, Richter D, Jakubas D, Wojczulanis–Jakubas K, Samecka–Cymerman A, 2015.

Therefore, understanding surface carbon sources and sinks is important when seeking to estimate the impact of CO2 on the environment and climate. CarbonTracker, developed by NOAA, is an inverse modeling system that estimates surface carbon fluxes using an ensemble Kalman filter with atmospheric CO2 measurements as constraints. In this study, we analyze the characteristics of CO2 distribution in the metropolitan area of South Korea. The CO2 concentration increases due to respiration near the surface during the night, and reaches a maximum at sunrise. Soon after sunrise, the CO2 mixing ratio decreases rapidly due to the entrainment of lower-CO2 aloft, photosynthetic uptake and turbulent mixing in CBL (Convective Boundary layer). A advection could also play a role as well but this is likely minor relative to the other contributing ones. The CO2 mixing ratio reaches a minimum around the late afternoon. As a result of this diurnal variation, the monthly mean CO2 decreases with height from the ground to the top of CBL.",

            "abstract": "Determination of sediment transfer time during transport in the alluvial plains is a critical issue to correctly understand the relationship between climate, tectonics and Earth surface evolution. The residence time of river sediments may be constrained by analyzing the U series nuclides fractionations (e.g. [1] and [2]), which are created during water rock interactions by the ejection of the daughter nuclides of the grain (α-recoil) and the preferential mobilization of nuclides in decay damaged crystal structure.\nHowever, recent studies on sediments from the Gandak river, one of the main Ganga tributary, highlighted the difficulties to obtain reproducible data on bulk sediments, due to the nuggets distribution of U-Th enriched minor minerals in the samples (Bosia et al., unpublished data).\nWe therefore decided to analyze the U and Th isotopic systematic at a grain-scale for Himalayan sediments from the Gandak river. This has been tested by performing in situ depth profiles of 238U-234U-230Th and 232Th on zircons and monazites (50-250 μm) by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) at the CRPG, Nancy, France. The first results point the occurrence of 238U-234U-230Th disequilibria in the outermost parts of both monazite and zircon minerals with a return to the equilibrium state in the core of the grains. The relative U and Th enrichment is however slightly different depending on considered minerals, suggesting possible adsorption processes of 230-Th.\nCoupled to a simple model of U and Th mobility during water-mineral interactions, these data should help to constrain the origin of 238U-234U-230Th disequilibria in these minerals. Moreover, the results of the study should be relevant to discuss the potential of this approach to constrain the residence time of zircons and monazites in the Gandak alluvial plain.\n[1] Chabaux et al., 2012, C.

            "abstract": "Long-term research conducted at multiple scales is critical to assessing the effects of key long term drivers (e.g., global population growth; land-use change; increased competition for natural resources; climate variability and change) on our ability to sustain or enhance agricultural production to meet future global demand for agricultural products (e.g., food; feed; fiber; fuel). To address this need, the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in collaboration with a broad group of partners, identified and reorganized existing long-term research infrastructure (i.e., benchmark watersheds; experimental ranges; research farms) into a Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) network, the only long-term research network focused specifically on US agro-ecosystems. In 2014, the initial network of 10 sites was expanded to 18 sites, including 3 sites led wholly or in part by non-USDA entities. Later this year, the LTAR network will make the first near real-time data sets from all 18 sites available on the web. This talk will focus briefly on LTAR establishment history, but primarily on LTAR’s current status and next steps, including plans for a final network expansion to complete coverage of key farm resource regions in the continental US. In the broader context of this symposium, this talk will set the stage for discussions of complementary long-term research networks (e.g., LTER; NEON) and potential future collaborations to address questions of mutual interest.",

            "abstract": "Life and climate evolved dramatically during the early Neoproterozoic - sedimentary rocks from this period record both the diversification of eukaryotic life as well as large scale fluctuations of the carbon cycle and paleogeography during the lead up to Cryogenian glaciation. Understanding global change leading up to this glaciation is critical for interpreting the conditions that initiated dramatic climate and geochemical oscillations. The Tonian-Cryogenian Tambien Group (Tigray region, northern Ethiopia) is a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentary succession deposited in an arc proximal basin that culminates in the Negash diamictite interpreted to represent the ca. 717-662 Ma Sturtian Glaciation. The presence of intercalated tuffs suitable for high precision U-Pb geochronology makes these sedimentary rocks an ideal target to temporally constrain physical and isotopic stratigraphic data sets of the early Neoproterozoic. The lower Tambien Group has been temporally constrained and used to establish global synchroneity of large scale carbon isotopic change ca. 800 Ma (Swanson-Hysell et al., 2015). We report the discovery of extensive exposures of upper Tambien Group successions southeast of the town of Samre within a newly mapped fold-thrust belt. Stratigraphic study across these exposures opens an opportunity to document environmental change across the basin during the apparently conformable transition from a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform into the Negash diamictite of the Sturtian Glaciation. The presence of ashes within the sediments holds the promise of combining high-precision dates with chemostratigraphic data to constrain global change before and during the onset of Snowball Earth glaciation.",

            "abstract": "Climate projections for the 21st century predict substantial changes in temperature and in the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation for large regions on the planet. Reductions in water availability resulting from decreased precipitation and increased water demand by the atmosphere can negatively affect plant metabolism, reduce carbon uptake, and limit services of entire ecosystems. Future increases in temperature and in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations may help offset some of these impacts on vegetation. In particular, plants may adjust their water use efficiency (WUE, plant production per water loss by evapotranspiration) in response to changing environmental conditions. We assessed an ensemble of thirteen models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and analyzed future changes in climate variables, carbon mass in vegetation, vegetation primary productivity and WUE. The analysis considered two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the period 2006-2099 and compared projections to historical values (1850–2005). Results include differences between historical and projected conditions for global, regional and latitudinal distributions of model outputs, for both RCPs. We observed significant intermodel variability when representing changes in WUE over the century, including high model sensitivity to different greenhouse concentration scenarios. Model agreement varied with RCP (higher agreement for RCP4.5), as well as regionally (higher agreement in Southeast Asia, lower agreement in arid areas, including the Sahara and Western Australia). The majority of models point to an increase in GPP and WUE for most of the planet under both concentration pathways, with changes ranging from zero to 100% of their historical values. These increases were observed to be consistently higher for RCP8.5. In addition, higher increases in GPP and WUE are predicted to occur over higher latitudes in the northern hemisphere (boreal areas), with WUE usually following GPP in changes. Modeling results show also decreases in productivity and WUE (from zero to -50%) mostly in the tropics, affecting tropical forests in Central America and in the Amazon.",

To understand where the tail energy is stored and released, temporal evolution of the current density was analyzed based on the THEMIS multi-point magnetic field data from 2007 to 2013. Field-aligned current density was always smaller than the cross-tail current density. A typical cross-tail current density in the near-Earth tail (X=-8 to -12 RE) was found to be ~2 nA/m^2, while in some cases, the current density increased above 4 nA/m^2. In the tail outside X~ -10 RE, the high current density was observed before the onset and decreased gradually during the expansion phase, being consistent with the previous studies. However, in the inner edge of the tail (X~ -8 RE), the current density was also high in quiet times. In addition to that it increased temporally after the onset for a few to several minutes. These properties suggest that the tail energy is released outside X~ -10 RE and that new current system, which may be related to the aurora formation, is formed after the onset within X~ -8 RE.",

The Reynolds decomposition technique determines at-a-point shear stresses at each measurement height, while the Law-of-the-Wall yields a single boundary layer estimate based on fitting a logarithmic velocity profile through the array data.\nAnalysis reveals significant inconsistencies between estimates derived from the two methods, on both a whole-event basis and as time-series. Despite a near-perfect fit of the Law-of-the-Wall, the point estimates of Reynolds shear stress vary greatly between heights, calling into question the assumed presence of a constant stress layer. A comparison with simultaneously measured sediment transport finds no relationship between transport activity and the discrepancies in shear stress estimates. Results do show, however, that Reynolds shear stress measured nearer the bed exhibits slightly better correlation with sand transport rate.\nThe findings serve as a major cautionary message to the interpretation and application of single-height measurements of Reynolds shear stress and their equivalence to Law-of-the-Wall derived estimates, and these concerns apply widely to boundary layer flows in general.",

            "abstract": "Peridotites in the upper Austroalpine Ulten zone (Eastern Italy) sample the subduction-modified Variscan mantle wedge. Metasomatism of peridotites during four stages of mantle wedge evolution includes: (1) Intrusion of alkaline melts from an inner, subduction-modified wedge and cryptic enrichment of spinel lherzolites (SL); (2) Reaction with siliceous crustal melts after pressure increase, generating coarse-grained garnet amphibole peridotites (GAP); (3) Crystallisation of abundant amphibole (± apatite and dolomite) from residual hydrous fluids during and/or after peak metamorphism recorded by fine-grained GAP; [4] Subsequent influx of crustal fluids, causing retrograde formation of spinel chlorite amphibole peridotites (SAP) [1-5]. SL and coarse GAP are apparently more fertile, whereas fine GAP and SAP retain the most depleted major-element characteristics. Overall, samples fall on partial melting trends consistent with extraction of low degrees of melt (F≤0.15) at 2-1 GPa.\nSL and coarse GAP have ±flat PGE patterns normalised to Primitive Upper Mantle (PUM), or show small decreases or increases from compatible to incompatible PGE. This suggests retention of primary sulphide liquid at low degrees of melting, during which PGE concentrations are little fractionated [6]. Indeed, broad positive correlations between the PGE suggest a common host, likely sulphide, observed in the samples as assemblages of pn ± po and cpy. Most fine-GAP share these patterns, indicating robustness against massive hydrous fluid influx, while Os/Ir > PUM argue against strong Os scavenging by highly oxidising hydrous fluids. Nevertheless, elevated Ru/IrPUM in a subgroup of samples may indicate a role for spinel addition under oxidising conditions. Most samples have 187Os/188Os >PUM, despite sub-PUM Re/Os, which requires addition of, or isotopic equilibration with, 187Os-rich crustal components, most likely via the precipitation of metasomatic sulphide.\n[1] Nimis and Morten (2000) J Geodyn 30: 93-115; [2] Rampone and Morten (2001) J Petrol 42: 207-219; [3] Tumiati et al.

The existing outcrop dataset has significant georeferencing issues including overestimation and generalisation of areas of rock exposure. The existing method for automated rock and snow differentiation, the Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) has trouble delineating rock and ice due to misclassification in the shaded regions of images and cannot delineate illuminated rock from clouds. This study presents a new method for identifying rock exposures from Landsat 8 data that excludes areas of snow (both illuminated and shaded), clouds and liquid water, achieving much higher accuracies than existing data and methods. The new methodology has been applied to the entire Landsat 8 coverage of the Antarctic continent (North of 82°40’) to produce a new rock outcrop dataset for Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Submarine volcanism is ubiquitous in active tectonic settings of the earth, but due to depth and hazardousness of these environments the study is a challenge. In May 2014, we performed a cruise in the Aegean Sea aimed to investigate the high-temperature (>200°C) hydrothermal system of Kolumbo active underwater volcano, 7 km northeast off Santorini. Last explosive eruption occurred in 1650 A.D. and killed ~70 people, so plainly the eruptive potential is real.\nWe sampled gases discharged from seven chimneys located at ~500 m b.s.l. and we investigated their composition. The chemistry indicates that these consist of almost pure CO2 with a small atmospheric contamination. The δ13C-CO2 varies from 0 to 1.5‰ and shows a positive correlation with the concentration of He, H2, CO and CH4 as the result of chemical and isotope fractionation due to variable extents of gas-water interaction. The 3He/4He varies from 7.0 to 7.1 Ra, coherently with the fact that this ratio does not suffer any fractionation due to gas-water interaction. These values are surprisingly higher (more than 3 units Ra) than the measurements performed in gases and rocks from Santorini (Rizzo et al., 2015). They are in the typical range of arc volcanoes worldwide (7-9 Ra; Hilton et al., 2002; Di Piazza et al., 2015), indicating that the 3He/4He ratios measured at Kolumbo are likely the result of direct mantle degassing in a general extensive regime. More importantly, these ratios are the highest in all the South Aegean volcanism, which leads to consider homogeneous (and MORB-like) the He isotope composition of the mantle below the central part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc and eastward up to Nisyros, which until this study showed the highest ratios (6.2Ra; Shimizu et al., 2005).\nOur results strongly emphasize the role of tectonics in the transfer of fluids from the mantle toward the surface. The complicated geodynamics status of the Aegean-Anatolian region, plays a key role in generating crustal stretching and rising up magma-bodies from the mantle into the crust.",

            "abstract": "Fine particular matter (PM2.5) is a major contributor to poor air quality in East Asia, with detrimental effects on air quality and climate. The elemental and isotopic composition of PM2.5 is powerful proxy for identifying emission sources, understanding atmospheric processing, and mitigating emissions of PM2.5. Here, we present a time-series of the elemental and isotopic composition of PM2.5 in East Asia, sampled at a periurban site (Mt. Taehwa, South Korea, August - October 2014) and over the Yellow Sea (onboard RV Gisang 1, November 2014). We measured the radiocarbon (14C) content of total carbon (TC) and elemental carbon (EC) with accelerator mass spectrometry and the carbon and nitrogen elemental and stable isotopic composition of bulk PM2.5 with isotope ratio mass spectrometry. At Mt. Taehwa, EC was depleted in 14C (fM-EC=0.224±0.071 (ave±SD, n=6)). The bulk PM2.5 was enriched in 14C above natural levels (fM-TC=1.19±0.47, n=9), with a δ13C of -25.6±0.5 (n=7), and a δ15N of 14.6±3.8 (n=4), and was strongly enriched in nitrogen (C:N=2.8±1.4, n=16). Over the Yellow Sea, bulk PM2.5 was depleted in 14C (fM-TC=0.57±0.07, n=5), with a δ13C of -24.2±0.8 (n=3), and a δ15N of 5.2±4.3 (n=3); EC was too small for 14C analysis.\n Our results confirm that periurban Mt. Taehwa site is exposed to combustion plumes of fossil fuels, especially from on-road sources. PM2.5 over the Yellow Sea turned out to be a mixture of fossil and biogenic emissions and experience more intense atmospheric processes. This isotope-based source apportionment of PM2.5 is a first step to characterize major sources of aerosols at Taehwa Research Forest, which was established to examine interactions of megacity and biogenic emissions and their impact on air quality.",

Despite the increasing use of laboratory experiments in teaching meteorology, however, we are aware that many teachers and students do not have access to suitable apparatus and so cannot benefit from them.

            "abstract": "We compare the solar and interplanetary events associated with two large solar energetic particle (SEP) events on 26 May 2012 and 3 November 2011. Both SEP events were detected at three longitudinally widely separated locations by STEREO A and B spacecraft (more than 100 deg away from Earth) and the Wind and SOHO spacecraft near Earth. In Earth view, the November 2011 eruption occurred far behind the east limb at N09E154, whereas the May 2012 eruption occurred closer to the west limb at N15W121, suggesting that SEPs accelerated during the 2012 event might have easier access to Earth. Even though the 2012 event was more intense in the GOES >10 MeV proton channel (peak intensity 14 pfu) than the 2011 event (peak intensity 4 pfu), we find that the latter event was more intense at higher energies (> 40 MeV). Also, the initial rise at lower energies was slightly faster for the 2011 event as measured by SOHO/ERNE. In addition, the CME associated with the May 2012 event was faster with an estimated space speed of ~2029 km/s than that in the November 2011 event (1188 km/s). STEREO/EUVI images of the associated post-eruption arcades (PEAs) indicate that their orientations were different: the PEA of the May 2012 event had a high inclination (north-south), while the inclination of the PEA of the 2011 event was more moderate. Differences in the flux rope orientation may also have effect on the longitudinal extent of the SEP events. These observations suggest that the dependence of solar proton intensities on the observer's longitudinal distance from the solar source is more complex than traditionally assumed.",

            "abstract": "Deltas are low-lying coastal areas that form where rivers flow into the ocean. Hosting dense populations, featuring rich biodiversity and being hot spots of both agricultural and industrial production, they are considered of great economic and ecological importance.\nLong-term sustainability of deltas is increasingly under threat due to the consequences of natural and man-made hazards, including large-scale human interventions such as dam construction and extraction of underground resources. Understanding prevailing vulnerabilities in these deltaic systems is becoming increasingly important for the development of spatially-targeted adaptation options at the sub-delta scale (coastal regions, floodplains etc.) which is imperative for the sustainability and in some cases even for the survival of deltaic social-ecological systems (SES).\nWe developed an inclusive SES-centered framework for vulnerability assessments, allowing for different sets of vulnerability indicators to be identified which can then be combined for deltas globally in a modular way. The modular structure allows being responsive to the specific multi-hazard settings of a given delta SES while also considering the interactions between the hazards in one given location. It therefore represents a departure from the usual fixed set of indicators used in existing vulnerability assessments. We present (1) the methods applied for indicator development, including local stakeholder consultations and a systematic literature review, as well as (2) the resulting modular set of indicators to be used in future spatially explicit vulnerability assessments. The approach aims to provide a ʾblueprintʿ for delta vulnerability assessments worldwide. Due to its modular structure it fosters both transferability and reproducibility.\nThis work is part of a global project on ‘Catalyzing action towards sustainability of deltaic systems (DELTAS)’ funded by the Belmont Forum and the 2015 Sustainable Deltas Initiative, endorsed by ICSU.",

Yet BVOCs also impact atmospheric chemistry processes, and lead to e.g. the built up of secondary organic aerosols. Abiotic stresses, such as drought, however highly influence plant physiology and subsequently BVOCs emission rates. In this study, we investigated the effect of drought stress on BVOCs emission rates of Scots pine trees, a de novo and pool emitter, under controlled climate chamber conditions within a dynamic enclosure system consisting of four plant chambers. Isotopic labeling with 13CO2 was used to detect which ratio of emissions of BVOCs derives from actual synthesis and from storage organs under different treatments. Additionally, the synthesis rate of the BVOCs synthesis can be determined.\nThe experiment consisted of two campaigns (July 2015 and August 2015) of two control and two treated trees respectively in four controlled dynamic chambers simultaneously. Each campaign lasted for around 21 days and can be split into five phases: adaptation, control, dry-out, drought- and re-watering phase. The actual drought phase lasted around five days. During the campaigns two samples of BVOCs emissions were sampled per day and night on thermal desorption tubes and analyzed by a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer and a flame ionization detector. Additionally, gas exchange of water and CO2, soil moisture, as well as leaf and chamber temperature was monitored continuously. 13CO2 labeling was performed simultaneously in all chambers during the phases control, drought and re-watering for five hours respectively. During the 13CO2 labeling four BVOCs emission samples per chamber were taken to identify the labeling rate on emitted BVOCs.\nFirst results show a decrease of BVOCs emissions during the drought phase and a recovery of emission after re-watering, as well as different strength of reduction of single compounds. The degree of labeling with 13CO2 differed between the emitted compounds, indicating different sources (pool / de novo) within the plant.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is separating the Eurasian and Anatolian plates representing a right-lateral transform plate boundary accommodating 20-30 mm annual slip. During the last seismic cycle the NAFZ has produced a series of large earthquakes that started in 1939 in Eastern Anatolia and has propagated westward towards the Istanbul-Marmara region. Here an up to 150 km long segment below the Sea of Marmara remains the only NAFZ segment that was not activated since 1766 representing a seismic gap hosting the potential for a magnitude up to 7.5 earthquake.\nHere we present a hypocenter catalogue for the Marmara section of the NAFZ which is a challenge since the fault is located offshore permitting no long-term on- or near fault stations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion applied on a characteristic function derived from higher order statistics as well as autoregressive forward prediction to automatically pick P- and S-onset times, we consistently analyze extensive waveform data provided by permanent seismic broadband stations of a combined regional seismic network with unprecedented station distribution.\nThe quality of automatically determined travel times is carefully examined by comparing them to manual reference picks which were determined with a scheme emphasizing highest possible consistency and precision. The high accuracy obtained for the travel times results in an improved hypocenter catalog with fewer but well-located events that allow to image the major fault branches of the NAFZ below the Sea of Marmara.\nThe large network aperture with lacking stations immediately above the seismicity along the fault and insufficient azimuthal station density prevents inversion for focal mechanisms of most single events. Therefore we form spatial seismicity clusters and calculate composite fault plane solutions. Resolving fault-zone geometry and kinematics allow to identify the currently active fault branches and to determine the currently ongoing processes along this key segment of the NAFZ.",

            "abstract": "As novel sensor types and new platforms are deployed to monitor the global oceans, the volumes of scientific and environmental data collected in the marine context are rapidly growing. In order to use these data in both the traditional operational modes and in innovative “Big Data” applications the data must be readily understood by software agents. One approach to achieving this is the application of both World Wide Web and Open Geospatial Consortium standards: namely Linked Data1 and Sensor Web Enablement2 (SWE). The British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) is adopting this strategy in a number of European Commission funded projects (NETMAR; SenseOCEAN; Ocean Data Interoperability Platform - ODIP; and AtlantOS) to combine its existing data archiving architecture with SWE components (such as Sensor Observation Services) and a Linked Data interface. These will evolve the data management and data transfer from a process that requires significant manual intervention to an automated operational process enabling the rapid, standards-based, ingestion and delivery of data. This poster will show the current capabilities of BODC and the status of on-going implementation of this strategy.",

            "abstract": "There are numerous approaches for estimating soil moisture. Examples include direct estimates with soil moisture probes and radar estimates of soil moisture, or indirect estimates based on modelling the water balance equation. Each has their advantages and disadvantages and for the most part these are related to the spatial support over which the measurements are made. In this work we define the spatial support as the vertical and horizontal area over which the estimate is made. In the case of soil moisture probes we effectively have a point horizontal support as in most cases the measurement volume is quite small, and in most cases sensors are arrayed vertically giving discrete point measurements throughout the soil profile. In terms of mapping soil moisture, probes are generally sparse in density. Radar estimates of soil moisture offer full spatial coverage and have a horizontal supports up to 20-40 km, however their vertical support is the first few cms of the soil profile. One major issue is how to combine observation from a range of different supports into a single prediction model. We address this here by presenting an approach which allows estimates of model parameters for datasets of different supports in both vertical and horizontal dimensions, and subsequent prediction with this data at any support vertically and horizontally. The approach is based on area-to-point kriging with residual maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. We use a case study from the Murrumbidgee catchment with two types of soil moisture estimates; point measurements from soil moisture probes which measure at 5 depths in the soil profile to 1.0 m, and a whole-profile estimate of soil moisture from a water balance model driven by remotely sensed components of ET from the MODIS 16 product and rainfall from TRMM.",

            "abstract": "Mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks such as stress-strain-relations are essential for understanding dynamic processes within the Earth’s crust. The measurement of in-situ lattice strain in bulk samples is possible with diffraction methods, e.g. with neutrons. The advantage of neutron diffraction is their high penetration depth, which enables to gather a statistically relevant number of grains by diffraction. The neutron time-of-flight diffraction at the strain diffractometer EPSILON which is located at the pulsed neutron source IBR-2M (JINR Dubna, RUS) enables the detection of the complete diffraction pattern up to λ = 7.1 Å (d = 5.1 Å).\nUniaxial cyclic deformation experiments were carried out up to 50 MPa (three steps) on a macroscopically isotropic sandstone from Kuhbach / Lahr (Germany). The aim of the present study is to model diffraction patterns for different applied stress-levels, based on the zero-stress diffraction pattern and known elastic properties of Quartz single crystals. The as received model-predictions are compared to observations, both, in the direction of maximum stress (along the cylindric axis) and perpendicular to it.\nThe results show that the shape of the grains has an influence on the macroscopic elastic behavior of the rock whereas the microscopic strain is affected in a different manner. The model is based on spherical quartz grains. The spheres are divided into slices. By removing some slices, the shape of sand grains is approximated. The reaction of each slice through the applied stress is modelled. Together with the relative volume of each slice and it´s elastic behavior, the diffraction pattern is predicted for different applied loads.\nMeasured and modelled diffraction-patterns at different applied loads are in good agreement.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical observations of the inner core today improve our understanding not just of the processes occurring in the core at the present, but also those that have occurred in the past. As the inner core freezes it may record clues as to the state of the Earth at the time of growth, although the texture of the inner core may also be modified through post-solidification mechanisms. The seismic structure of the inner core is not simple; the dominant pattern is one of anisotropic and isotropic differences between the Eastern and Western 'hemispheres' of the inner core. Additionally, there is evidence for an innermost inner core, layering of the uppermost inner core, and possibly super-rotation of the inner core relative to the mantle.\nMost body wave studies of inner core structure use PKP-PKIKP differential travel times to constrain velocity variations within the inner core. However, body wave studies are inherently limited by the geometry of fixed sources and stations, and thus there are some areas of the inner core that are relatively under-sampled, even in today’s data-rich world. Here, we examine the differential travel times of the different branches of P′P′ (PKIKPPKIKP and PKPPKP), comparing the arrival time of inner core sensitive branch, P′P′df, with the arrival times of branches that only reach the outer core. By using P′P′ we are able to exploit alternative ray geometries and sample different regions of the inner core to those areas accessible to studies which utilize PKIKP.\nWe use both linear and non-linear stacking methods to make observations of small amplitude P’P’ phases. These measurements match the broad scale hemispherical pattern of anisotropy in the inner core.",

These may vary the electron density distribution and cause changes in the reflection and absorption of HF radio signals. Other consequences include the formation of enhanced convective flows and irregularity features which may contribute to Doppler clutter. While there has been much discussion on the ionospheric signatures of magnetic storms at high latitudes, this presentation focuses on effects detected using mid- and low-latitude HF radars which examine field lines mapping to the vicinity of the ring current. Characteristic features include travelling ionospheric disturbances, high velocity flows and sustained irregular and quasi-sinusoidal 5 - 20 mHz waves recorded near the plasmapause. Such observations provide new insight on complex M-I coupling dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Magma compositions vary widely within many eruptions of ocean island volcanoes, particularly those in the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands. The 23 November 2014 to 7 February 2015 eruption of Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands was the first eruption in either the Canaries or the Cape Verdes to be monitored by multiple satellite instruments that measured infrared emissions of the eruption and so enabled continuous quantitative estimation of magma effusion rates and their variation through time. It is also the first eruption in the Cape Verdes for which seismic tremor intensity, indicative of magma ascent dynamics, was continuously recorded. Effusion rates were highest, peaking at about 20 m3/s, in the first five days of eruption but later asymptotic decay in effusion rate was interrupted around 9 and 16 December by pulses of increased effusion. Activity was mainly mildly explosive from December 31, accompanied by intensified seismic tremor. A final pulse of low-rate lava effusion occurred from 17 to 22 January. These data provide a new framework within which to relate compositional variations in the eruption to variations in magma ascent and effusion. We collected a suite of samples whose dates of emplacement have been determined from the date of incandescence of each sample site in high-resolution thermal infrared emissivity maps collected by satellite during the eruption. The samples are highly porphyritic and strongly alkaline in composition, as is typical of Fogo magmas. The first- (November 23/24) and last- (January) erupted magma batches show evidence for hybridization with more evolved magma batches, and the 9 and 16 December magma pulses may be distinct from the magma erupted during the main phase of the eruption. We present data on the samples that allow us to examine the hypothesis that the effusion rate variations were controlled by tapping of different parts of the magma reservoir or reservoirs during the eruption.",

            "abstract": "Until recently much science communication focused on press conferences and results, “Eureka”-moments issued from podiums. Recent documentaries, however, such as PARTICLE FEVER and THE YEAR OF PLUTO go behind the scenes to show long years of effort, and occasional failures, revealing a more honest—and more engaging—picture of how science is actually done. Audiences respond when researchers show a more human face, and candid moments of stress and exhaustion as well as exhilaration make eventual results more meaningful. This presentation will offer evidence that this approach is also effective on contested topics such as climate change, where long-term relationships between journalists and researchers can help structure communications that avoid distracting controversies. A cameraman spends a full week with ornithologist George Divoky on remote Cooper Island, Alaska: the resulting video podcast informs a stage play in London, and George goes on the road with POLAR-PALOOZA across America and internationally, sharing stories about the birds he studies and the polar bears he has to increasingly avoid, as climate change brings them onshore in search of food. POLAR-PALOOZA also introduced Richard Alley and other Arctic and Antarctic scientists to a team of producers and directors, resulting in a 3-part PBS series and museum outreach that is able to present climate change science in an authoritative and apolitical way. That leads, in turn, to leading researchers including video and more visually-dynamic approaches in communicating their work to the public. An upcoming public television series, THE CROWD & THE CLOUD, will devote one program to insights about climate change gained over decades of interaction between producers and scientists. Many mainstream media outlets have cut back on science coverage and released their dedicated “beat” reporters. However a wealth of new channels offer venues for this approach, and falling prices for high quality cameras and editing systems mean production barriers are minimal. Long term relationships between sources and producers rather than one-off exchanges can generate more authentic information, conveyed in more engaging formats, which is essential to better understanding of GMOs, AI, GEC, and other key scientific and social topics.",

We used this model to predict the solar wind plasma parameters as well as the interplanetary magnetic field components at Pluto and along the New Horizons trajectory during the whole calendar year of 2015 including the closest approach on July 14. The simulation is run in the solar equatorial plane in the heliographic inertial frame (HGI). The inner boundary conditions along a circle of 1 AU radius are set by near-Earth solar wind observations (hourly OMNI data), assuming that the global solar wind distribution does not change much during a Carrington rotation (27.2753 days). Our 2-D multi-fluid MHD code evolves one ion fluid and two neutral fluids, which are the primary interstellar neutral atoms and the interstellar neutral atoms deflected in the outer heliosheath between the slow bow shock and the heliopause. Spherical expansion effects are properly taken into account for the ions and the solar magnetic field. The inflow parameters of the two neutral fluids (density, temperature, and velocity components) are set at the negative X (HGI) boundary at 50 AU distance, which are taken from previous 3-D global multi-fluid MHD simulations of the heliospheric interface in a much larger simulation box (1500x1500x1500 AU). The inflow velocity vectors of the two neutral fluids define the so-called hydrogen deflection plane. The solar wind ions and the interstellar neutrals interact through charge exchange source terms included in the multi-fluid MHD equations, so the two neutral populations are evolved self-consistently. We validate our model with the available plasma data from New Horizons as well as with Voyager 2 plasma and magnetic field observations within the heliocentric distance of 50 AU. Our new time-dependent 2-D multi-fluid MHD model is generally applicable for solar wind predictions at any outer planet (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) or spacecraft in the outer heliosphere where charge exchange between solar wind ions and interstellar neutrals play an important role.",

            "abstract": "Mountain glaciers around the world, particularly in Alaska, are experiencing significant surface mass loss from rapid climatic shifts and constitute a large proportion of the cryosphere’s contribution to sea level rise. Surface albedo acts as a primary control on a glacier’s mass balance, yet it is difficult to measure and quantify spatially and temporally in steep, mountainous settings. During our 2013 field campaign in Denali National Park to recover two surface to bedrock ice cores, we used an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec4 Standard Resolution spectroradiometer to measure incoming solar radiation, outgoing surface reflectance and optical grain size on the Kahiltna Glacier and at the Kahiltna Base Camp. A Campbell Scientific automatic weather station was installed on Mount Hunter (3900m) in June 2013, complementing a longer-term (2008-present) station installed at Kahiltna Base Camp (2100m). Use of our in situ data aids in the validation of surface albedo values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite imagery. Comparisons are made between ASD FieldSpec4 ground measurements and 500m MODIS imagery to assess the ability of MODIS to capture the variability of surface albedo across the glacier surface. The MODIS MCD43A3 BRDF/Albedo Product performs well at Kahiltna Base Camp (<5% difference from ASD shortwave broadband data), but low biases in MODIS albedo (10-28% relative to ASD data) appear to occur along the Kahiltna Glacier due to the snow-free valley walls being captured in the 500m MODIS footprint. Incorporating Landsat imagery will strengthen our interpretations and has the potential to produce a long-term (1982-present) validated satellite albedo record for steep and mountainous terrain. Once validation is complete, we will compare the satellite-derived albedo record to the Denali ice core accumulation rate, aerosol records (i.e. volcanics and biomass burning), and glacier mass balance data. This research will ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the relationship between glacier albedo, surface processes, and regional glacier hydroclimate.",

In the historical record, in 1916/1917 there was an double seismic event occurred at the similar location, which seriously damaged this mountain area. It became seismically quiescent until 2013, again occurred double seismic sequences led by two large earthquakes of M6.2 and 6.5 in March and June respectively. The geometries of above-mentioned two clusters for all aftershocks of ML > 2.0 are concordant with the focal mechanism derived from main shocks. Spatially they show two separated low angle east-dipping fault planes, implying two different asperities, but roughly distributed in similar attitude. According to previously published model, an active structure under the well-known decollement of Taiwan mountain belts is suggested by background seismicities. The proposed fault planes of this study may be its extension or connecting another one in the deeper depth.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from African agricultural systems are thought to comprise a large portion of total emissions from the continent, however these estimates have been calculated using emission factors (EF) from other regions due to the lack of field studies in Africa, which results in large uncertainties for these estimates. Field measurements from western Kenya calculating emissions over a year in 59 different sites found that GHG emissions from typical smallholder farms ranged from 2.8 to 15.0 Mg CO2-C ha-1, -6.0 to 2.4 kg CH4-C ha-1 and -0.1 to 1.8 kg N2O-N ha-1, and were not affected by management intensity. The lack of a response in N2O emissions to N fertilization suggests that the EF currently used in national inventories overestimates N2O emissions from typical smallholder agriculture. Another study measuring N2O and CH4 emissions from manure deposited by grazing cattle found that the N2O EF ranged from 0.1 to 0.2%, while the CH4 EF ranged from 0.04 to 0.14 Kg CH4-C per 173 kg animal. These suggest that the current IPCC EF overestimate agricultural soil and manure GHG emissions for Kenya, and likely for much of East Africa.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal snow cover is the primary water resource precursor for human use and environmental sustain along the extratropical Andes Cordillera. This research provides high-resolution distributed estimates of end-of-winter and spring snow water equivalent over a 152,000-km2 domain, based on remotely sensed snow cover and a simplified snowpack energy balance model. Important data for model validation was obtained through a sustained effort aimed at monitoring snow conditions throughout the domain from newly installed sensors and snow surveys. Peak SWE estimates show an overall coefficient of determination R2 of 0.61 compared to observations at 12 automatic snow water equivalent sensors distributed across the model domain between latitudes 30º S and 37º S, with R2 values between 0.32 and 0.88. Estimated patterns of snow accumulation reflect appropriately the dominant effect of elevation, and suggest that the current government operational snow observation network may be inadequate under future climate change scenarios. Several insights can be obtained by analyzing the shortcomings of the modeling results when compared with high-resolution time series of energy and mass balance, as well as with distributed SWE observations obtained at experimental catchments. The results presented here have the potential of informing applications such as seasonal forecast model assessment and improvement, regional climate model validation, as well as evaluation of observational networks and water resource infrastructure development.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric nanoparticles constitute the greatest portion of ambient aerosol loading by number. A major source of atmospheric nanoparticles is new particle formation (NPF), a gas to particle conversion process whereby clusters nucleate from gas phase precursors to form clusters on the order of one or a few nanometers and then grow rapidly to climatically relevant sizes. A substantial fraction of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are thought to arise from NPF. In order to better predict the frequency, growth rates, and climatic impacts of NPF, knowledge of the chemical mechanisms by which nucleated nanoparticles grow is needed. The two main contributors to particle growth are (neutralized) sulfate and carbonaceous matter. Particle growth by sulfuric acid condensation is generally well understood, though uncertainty remains about the extent of base neutralization and the relative roles of ammonia and amines. Much less is known about carbonaceous matter, and field measurements suggest that nitrogen-containing species are important. In this presentation, recent work by our group will be described that uses a combination of ambient measurements, laboratory experiments and computational work to study carbonaceous matter in growing nanoparticles. These studies span a range of particle sizes from the initial adsorption of molecules onto a nanometer-size ammonium bisulfate seed cluster to reactions in particles that are large enough to support condensed-phase chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Constraining past ice mass changes, identifying their cause(s) and determining rigorous error estimates, is important for closing the sea level budget and as an input for and test of numerical models. Despite the progress that has been made over the last decade, significant differences remain for estimates of the mass evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet. These estimates often yield conflicting results with non-overlapping error bars, while the commonly adopted use of different forward models to isolate and remove the effects of glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) and surface mass balance (SMB) processes introduces another source of uncertainty which is hard to quantify. To address both these issues, we present a statistical modeling approach that utilises a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model, alongside novel dimensional reduction methods to allow the solution to remain tractable in the presence of the large number (> 10^7) of observations. We solve simultaneously for GIA, surface processes, elastic rebound, firn compaction and ice dynamics.\nOver 2003-2013, Antarctica has been losing mass at a rate of -82+-23 Gt/yr. West Antarctica is the largest contributor with -114+-10 Gt/yr, mainly triggered by high thinning rates of glaciers draining into the Amundsen Sea Embayment. The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a dramatic increase in mass loss in the last decade, with a mean rate of -25+-6 Gt/yr, and significantly higher values for the most recent years following the destabilization of the Southern Antarctic Peninsula around 2010. The total mass loss is partly compensated by a significant mass gain of 57+-20 Gt/yr in East Antarctica due to positive SMB anomalies and an interesting small dynamic component. We compare our time series of SMB anomalies with those from RACMO-2.3, obtaining good agreement for the large-scale patterns, although differences arise at a basin scale. Also, a data-driven GIA solution is obtained which could be used to constrain and validate existing and future forward models.",

            "abstract": "It has been known that submarine fans are diverse in constitutive architectural elements. Leveed channels are common architectural elements of submarine fans but some of submarine fans lack such self-constructive channels. Also, frontal splays that develops at the end of channels cannot be observed in all of submarine fans. Several researches suggested that this diversity of submarine fans is originated from attributes of sediment supply such as ratio between sand and mud. However, quantitative investigation of these phase changes in types of submarine fans has not been explored yet.\nHere, this study aims to consider deterministic parameters that govern types of submarine fans, using a theoretical model that assumes submarine channel are in equilibrium condition. The model is based on the 4 equation model of turbidity currents that considers conservation of turbulent kinetic energy. The equilibrium profile is here defined as profiles where turbidity currents are bypassing or depositing uniformly. 1D momentum conservation is considered, and grain-size distribution is approximated to two size classes: channel-forming sands and levee-forming muddy sediments. Widths of channel and levees are calculated from empirical hydraulic geometry. The model predicts length of leveed channels in the equilibrium condition and hydraulic conditions at downstream end of the channels.\nAs a result, depending on boundary condition at upstream end of channels, three possible cases were recognized: (A) submarine channels in which levee-forming muddy sediments are run out at the end of channel, (B) submarine channels in which sandy sediments are run out, and (C) no possible equilibrium profiles that satisfy empirical hydraulic geometry for given boundary conditions. It can be interpreted that these types of results correspond to submarine channels with/without frontal splays and submarine fans without leveed channels. Essentially three parameters are significant to determine types of submarine channels: sand/mud ratio of supplied sediments, discharge of turbidity currents and rate of aggradation of channels. Although application of this research is reconnaissance, our model may be useful to estimate flow conditions from topographic features of submarine fans and distribution of lithofacies from limited information.",

All of these programs sought/seek to support high quality STEM education for majors and non-majors in lower- and upper-division undergraduate courses. The current IUSE-EHR program is described in a 2-year solicitation that includes two tracks: Engaged Student Learning, and Institutional & Community Transformation. Each track has several options for funding level and project duration. A wide range of activities can be proposed for funding, and the program recognizes the varying needs across STEM disciplines.\nGeoscientists and other potential IUSE proposers are strongly encouraged to form collaborations with colleagues that conduct educational research and to propose projects that build upon the educational knowledge base in the discipline as well as contribute to it. Achieving this may not be immediately obvious to many geoscientists who have interests in improving student learning in their courses, but are not fluent in the scholarship of education in their field. To lower the barriers that have historically prevented larger numbers of geoscientists from developing their ideas into competitive education-related proposals, we have explored strategies for building and leveraging partnerships, sought to identify available resources for proposers, and explored a range of strategies for engaging and supporting larger numbers of potential geoscience proposers.",

In this paper we first demonstrate the current status of our new network followed by the initial scientific results. The lightning jump algorithm was applied to our total lightning data to study the relationship between total lighting activity and hazardous weather events such as gust fronts and tornadoes over land reported by the JMA (Japanese Meteorological Agency) in 2014. As a result, a clear increase in total lighting flash rate as well as lightning jumps are observed prior to most hazardous weather events (~20 min) indicating potential usefulness for early warning in Japan. Furthermore we are going to demonstrate the relationship of total lightning activities with meteorological radar data focusing particularly on Japanese Tornadic storms.",

            "abstract": "Disparate models have been proposed for the origin of A-type rhyolites--a volumetrically minor part of modern terrestrial magmatism. But understanding the origin of A-type granites and rhyolites has significance for understanding the formation of the Earth's first silicic crust and for planetary magmatism--small volumes of such granitic materials have been found in lunar rocks, martian and asteroidal meteorites, and have been speculated to have formed on Venus. On other planets, vertical tectonics and plume-like mantle convection dominate, not the recycling of wet, oxidized plates of lithosphere as on Earth. Thus, understanding the origins of A-type silicic magma is important on multiple levels. Voluminous A-type rhyolite were produced on the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone hotspot track and provide the opportunity to better understand these important silicic magmas.\nDetailed petrologic studies suggest that most Snake River Plain rhyolites ultimately formed by partially melting of previously emplaced basaltic intrusions rather than by fractional crystallization of basalt or melting of Archean crust. This hypothesis is favored because of the bimodal association of rhyolite and basalt without linking intermediate compositions. In addition, incompatible element ratios (e.g., La/Nb, Pb/Ce), a lack of old zircon antecrysts, low-U inherited zircon, high εNd and εHf values, high eruption temperatures (1050°C to 850°C), low fO2 (near QFM), and H2O (as low as 1.5%), link the rhyolites to a plume-derived basaltic parent through partial melting with lesser incorporation of the Archean to Mesozoic crust that underlies the plain. Moreover, the contrast with wetter, lower temperature rhyolites that must have formed by direct crustal melting (e.g., Arbon Valley Tuff) strengthens this interpretation.\nMany of the rhyolites also have low δ18O values that must be produced in two stages: first by partial melting of already hydrothermally altered basalt, and subsequently in single volcanic centers, by progressive cannibalism of hydrothermally altered intracaldera rhyolites like those identified in many calderas and the Kimberly drill core. The oxygen and Hf isotopic diversity of zircon found in most units is one of the principle evidences for this pervasive recycling.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that mass loss from Southeast Greenland is a significant percentage (~50%) of total ice loss from the entire Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). The greatest contributors to SE GrIS mass loss are the marine-terminating outlet glaciers Helheim and Kangerlussuaq. Since the early 2000s, the behavior of Kangerlussuaq Glacier can be characterized as a simple diffusion thinning event, with dramatic thinning commencing at the calving front in 2004 and then diffusing upglacier. Helheim Glacier, however, experienced a dramatic thinning event (~50 m) in 2004 with an abrupt cessation in 2006, followed by a sequence of thickening/thinning events of lesser magnitude from 2006 - 2012. This complex behavior is further investigated using multi-sensor surface elevation data over a broad region (~200 km2) of the glacier trunk during the period of 1981 - 2012. This dataset provides a highly accurate record of elevation changes for Helheim Glacier, and demonstrates that the onset of the rapid thinning event occurred over most of the glacier trunk rather than at the calving front. At the commencement of the rapid thinning event, Helheim Glacier’s calving front appeared to be grounded. This is in contrast to Kangerlussuaq Glacier and Jakobshavn Isbræ, which were approaching flotation prior to their rapid thinning events in 2004 and 1999, respectively. Additionally, the new dataset reveals curvilinear bands (≥1 km long, ≥100 m wide) of significant elevation change (≥10 m) compared to the surrounding ice, corresponding to lateral shear zones and tributary confluence junctions. Ice velocity data will also be examined at similar temporal and spatial scales as the elevation dataset to reconstruct an accurate timeline of events for Helheim Glacier and better determine the cause of the observed complex behavior.",

            "abstract": "Glyoxal (CHOCHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are among the most important carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere. Given their short lifetime (typically a few hours) and since they are mainly produced by the oxidation of biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), they are very good proxy for detecting active VOCs chemistry which can be responsible for the formation of pollutants such as tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols. Both CHOCHO and HCHO are also directly released by biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion. Measuring these species is therefore of major importance for air quality monitoring, especially given the scarcity of available observational data sets.\nIn this presentation, CHOCHO and HCHO vertical profiles and corresponding column densities are retrieved from ground-based MAX-DOAS (Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) measurements in the Beijing city center and at the suburban site of Xianghe located at 60km East of Beijing. The periods covered by the observations are June 2008-April 2009 in Beijing and March 2010-December 2014 in Xianghe. We first investigate the capability of the MAX-DOAS technique to measure these species in such highly-polluted environment. Then the diurnal and seasonal cycles of CHOCHO and HCHO near-surface concentrations and vertical column densities as well as the corresponding CHOCHO/HCHO ratios (RGF) are examined on a long-term basis at both locations. This RGF ratio is often used as an indicator of changes in the atmospheric VOC mixture. Finally, these diurnal and seasonal cycles are further assessed using simulations from the 3D chemistry transport model IMAGES and observations from the OMI and GOME-2 satellite nadir sensors.",

            "abstract": "We present a new plate tectonic reconstruction for the drift of Madagascar away from East Africa using the new Sandwell and Smith gravity dataset (V23.1). Detailed interpretation of free-air and Bouguer anomalies, together with gravity gradients, has allowed interpretation of the extinct mid ocean ridge and associated fracture zone lineaments from the Western Somali Basin. Combined with temporal constraints from previous ocean magnetic anomaly interpretations, this analysis produces a reconstruction that supports Reeves’ (2014) tight fit of Gondwana fragments. Furthermore, it sheds light on the nature of the Davie Fracture Zone (DFZ) and the position of the continent-ocean boundary (COB) in the region.\nThe model predicts that the COB lies along the Rovuma Basin; and that offshore Tanzania is most likely a segmented and obliquely rifted margin, not a transform continental margin along the DFZ as previously thought. This places the COB up to several hundred kilometres farther inboard than previous interpretations, which is supported by new seismic evidence of oceanic crust inboard of the DFZ. We show the DFZ to be a major ocean-ocean fracture zone formed by the coalescence of several smaller fracture zones during a change in plate motions as Madagascar escaped from Africa.\nThis new geodynamical understanding has important implications for petroleum industry activities in East Africa, as the expected heat flow varies dramatically between oceanic and continental crust.\nReeves, C., 2014.

We here report on the mantle convection code ASPECT (the Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion) that is developed to be a community tool with a focus on bringing modern numerical methods such as adaptive meshes, large parallel computations, algebraic multigrid solvers, and modern software design.\nWe will comment in particular on two aspects: First, the more recent additions to its numerical capabilities, such as compressible models, averaging of material parameters, melt transport, free surfaces, and plasticity. We will demonstrate these capabilities using examples from computations by members of the ASPECT user community. Second, we will discuss lessons learned in writing a code specifically for community use. This includes our experience with a software design that is fundamentally based on a plugin system for practically all areas that a user may want to describe for the particular geophysical setup they want to simulate. It also includes our experience with leading and organizing a community of users and developers, for example by organizing annual “hackathons”, by encouraging code submission via github over keeping modifications private, and by designing a code for which extensions can easily be written as separate plugins rather than requiring knowledge of the computational core.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere during the last three decades show a weak but positive trend in almost all months. These changes seem to be attributable to an enhancement of the meridional flow in the areas of the Ross and Weddell Seas and changes in the Ekman transport due to a more positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), favored by the depletion of Antarctic stratospheric ozone.\nAt the same time, climate model studies forced with observed Antarctic ozone changes suggested the ozone hole to be responsible for a sea ice retreat, explained by a warming of the Antarctic near coastal waters as a result of enhanced ocean upwelling due to the same mechanism (e.g. stronger westerlies in the positive SAM phase).\nIn our study we find however that the Antarctic ozone depletion in spring does not only lead to stronger westerlies, but also to a strengthening of the Amundsen Sea Low, causing locally a stronger southerly flow and resulting in an enhanced export of sea ice in summer and autumn, and subsequently to a positive trend in the sea ice extent, as observed.\nFor this purpose, two simulations with the coupled atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model EMAC-O (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry with MPIOM ocean) have been analyzed and compared, one representing transient climate and ozone change, and one including only ozone depleting substances as driver.",

There is a broad spectrum of methods applied for measuring soil water content in the field either deployed in situ or non-invasively from the surface. For many reasons the latter is preferred in field studies. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of the rare methods that measure the water content directly. Whereas others, e.g. geophysical methods, make use of proximal relationships for determination of soil water content. We applied a new single-sided NMR sensor to non-invasively measure in-situ soil moisture profiles at several points along two transects in a floodplain. The field site exhibits variations in soil water content due to morphology, e.g. flood channels and alluvial fan structures. Furthermore we applied at the same transects (1) in situ methods: soil sampling for gravimetrical analysis and TDR and (2) non-invasive methods: electromagnetical induction, mobile cosmic-ray neutron sensing with a rover and gamma-ray spectrometry. We will present results that confirm agreement of NMR and gravimetrical analysis from soil sampling and discuss issues that arise when using non-unique proxy methods and relationships for determination of soil water content.",

            "abstract": "The concept of a “category 2 center”—i.e., one that is closely affiliated with UNESCO, but not legally part of UNESCO—dates back many decades. However, only in the last decade has the concept been fully developed. Within UNESCO, the International Hydrological Programme (IHP) has led the way in creating a network of regional and global water-related centers.\nICIWaRM—the International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management—is one member of this network. Approved by UNESCO’s General Conference, the center has been operating since 2009. It was designed to fill a niche in the system for a center that was backed by an institution with on-the-ground water management experience, but that also had strong connections to academia, NGOs and other governmental agencies. Thus, ICIWaRM is hosted by the US Army Corps of Engineers’ Institute for Water Resources (IWR), but established with an internal network of partner institutions.\nThree main factors have contributed to any success that ICIWaRM has achieved in its global work:\nA focus on practical science and technology which can be readily transferred. This includes the Corps’ own methodologies and models for planning and water management, and those of our university and government partners.\nCollaboration with other UNESCO Centers on joint applied research, capacity-building and training. A network of centers needs to function as a network, and ICIWaRM has worked together with UNESCO-affiliated centers in Chile, Brazil, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Japan, China, and elsewhere.\nPartnering with and supporting existing UNESCO-IHP programs. ICIWaRM serves as the Global Technical Secretariat for IHP’s Global Network on Water and Development Information in Arid Lands (G-WADI). In addition to directly supporting IHP, work through G-WADI helps the center to frame, prioritize and integrate its activities.\nWith the recent release of the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is clear that implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all governmental levels is an international priority. This underscores the continued need for internationally focused institutions that can combine the engineering, natural science, and social science aspects of IWRM.",

            "abstract": "A process-based understanding of weathering in actively eroding mountain belts is vital to understand how linkages between erosion and weathering affect global biogeochemical cycles on a range of timescales. Here we present surface water chemistry data from Southern Taiwan that demonstrates the impact of variable erosive processes on weathering budgets on a large range of scales, from tens of metres to large catchments (>50km2). Southern Taiwan is an excellent example of a number of gradients in erosive processes, with relief and median slope increasing from the southernmost small hills to mountainous threshold-hillslopes with up to 2.5km of relief approximately 100km to the north. Furthermore, Typhoon Morakot (2009) triggered extremely extensive landsliding in some catchments within this zone, allowing distinctions to be drawn between average topographic characteristics of catchments and the erosive processes (i.e. mass wasting) at work therein. Landslides play an important role in localising weathering in deposits with high internal surface area and slow throughflow of fluids, creating sites of rapid weathering which can be a first order control on catchment solute budgets in watersheds where landslides deposits and scars exceed 2% of drained area. Variation in the detailed chemistry of landslide seepages – particularly the carbonate/silicate weathering balance – indicates that this process has a different impact on inorganic weathering-driven carbon cycling than slower erosive processes; a strong positive correlation between landslide-affected area and Ca2+:Si ratios on catchment scale suggests rapid erosion is not strongly coupled to CO2 drawdown. Rapid oxidation of sulphides – ubiquitous in many rapidly eroding mountain belts – within highly fragmented landslide deposits, and associated sulphuric-acid driven weathering, further complicates the effect landsliding has on the carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Subaqueous fans are distributive channel systems that form in a variety of settings including offshore marine, sub-lacustrine, and reservoirs. These distributive systems create complex sedimentation patterns through repeated avulsion to fill in a basin. Here we ran a series of experiments to explore the intrinsic controls on avulsion cycles on subaqueous fans. Experiments are a convenient way to study these systems since the time-scale of fan development is dramatically shortened compared to natural settings, all boundary conditions can be controlled, and the experimental domain can be instrumented to monitor the pertinent hydraulic and morphologic variables. Experiments in this study used saline underflows and crushed plastic sediment fed down an imposed slope covered in the sediment. Avulsion cycles are a central feature in these experiments which are characterized by: (1) channel extension and stagnation; (2) bar aggradation and hydraulic jump initiation; (3) upstream retreat; and (4) flow avulsion. Looking at and analyzing these cycles yield the following conclusions: (1) distributive channels cease progradation due to a drop in sediment transport capacity in an expanded region ahead of the channel; (2) mouth bar aggradation leads to a large flow obstacle to cause the hydraulic jump feedback; (3) hydraulic jump regions are a significant locus of deposition; and (4) the upstream retreat rate is a function of sediment supply and the strength of the jump. We found that simple one-dimensional hydraulic principles such as the choked flow condition and the sequent depth ratio help to explain hydraulic jump initiation and emplaced lobe thickness respectively.",

            "abstract": "Solar prominences exhibit a range of eruptive-like dynamic activity, including in some cases the confined or 'failed' ejection of prominence material from the solar atmosphere. Many prominences exhibit a partial eruption in which some mass escapes while the remaining mass drains back to the photosphere. This process may involve the formation of an X-type neutral line in this region, which allows disconnection of part of the prominence material. In a previous study (Gilbert et al. 2000) it was found that this separation tends to occur in the height range from 1.20 to 1.35 Rsun. More recently, the separation point in these types of partial eruptions has been observed to occur at much larger heights. We investigate a selection of these higher partial eruptions, exploring the characteristics of the prominences and their associated CMEs to better understand the dynamical processes in the solar atmosphere associated with eruption.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring long-term biomass dynamics in global drylands is of great importance for global carbon cycle modeling and has been done extensively based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) observations. However, there are limitations from both the characteristics of NDVI (e.g. atmosphere and cloud contamination, saturation in densely vegetated areas, and affected by varying vegetation species compositions) and sensor related artifacts (e.g. orbital drifts, sensor changes). Being sensitive to the vegetation water content and not affected by clouds, the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) derived from satellite passive microwave observations can be an alternative to NDVI for monitoring biomass dynamics in drylands, yet further evaluations based on ground measurements are needed. In this study, we assess the capability of a long-term VOD dataset (1992–2011) to capture the temporal and spatial variability of in situ measured biomass data (herbaceous and woody foliage mass) in the semi-arid Senegalese Sahel. The GIMMS3g (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies, 3rd generation) NDVI dataset is included for comparison purpose. Both VOD and NDVI reflect the temporal and spatial pattern of the ground data very well, however, the phenological metrics leading to the best correlations differ between VOD and NDVI. While the annual sum and maximum perform best for VOD, the growing integrals have the highest correlations for NDVI. Furthermore, VOD proves to be robust against typical NDVI drawbacks (species compositions, and saturation effects). Overall, in spite of the coarse resolution, the study shows that satellite passive microwave observation based VOD is an efficient proxy for estimating biomass production of the entire vegetation layer in the Sahel and potentially in other dryland areas.",

            "abstract": "Known hydrothermal activity along the Mid–Atlantic Ridge is mostly high–temperature venting, controlled by volcano–tectonic processes confined to ridge axes and neotectonic zones ~15km wide on each side of the axis (e.g. TAG or Snake Pit). However, extensive exploration and discoveries of new hydrothermal fields in off–axis regions (e.g. Lost City, MAR) show that hydrothermalism may, in some areas, be dominated by off–axis venting. Little is known about nature of such systems, including whether low–temperature “diffuse” venting dominates rather than high–temperature black-smokers. This is particularly interesting since such systems may transport up to 90% of the hydrothermal heat to the oceans.\nIn this study we use Icelandic hot springs as onshore analogues for off–shore hydrothermal activity along the MAR to better understand volcano-tectonic controls on their occurrence, along with processes supporting fluid circulation. Iceland is a unique laboratory to study how new oceanic crust cools and suggests that old crust may not be as inactive as previously thought. Our results show that Tertiary (>3.3 Myr) crust of Iceland (Westfjords) has widespread low–temperature hydrothermal activity. Lack of tectonism (indicated by lack of seismicity), along with field research suggest that faults in Westfjords are no longer active and that once sealed, can no longer support hydrothermal circulation, i.e. none of the hot springs in the area occur along faults. Instead, dyke margins provide open and permeable fluid migration pathways. Furthermore, we suggest that the Reykjanes Ridge (south of Iceland) may be similar to Westfjords with hydrothermalism dominated by off–axis venting. Using bathymetric data we infer dyke positions and suggest potential sites for future exploration located away from neotectonic zone. We also emphasise the importance of biological observations in seeking for low-temperature hydrothermal activity, since chemical or optical methods are not sufficient.",

            "abstract": "Convergent plate tectonic boundaries where a denser oceanic lithosphere is deposited on top of a less dense continent in an obduction process represent enigmatic regions with unexplained origin. So far, numerical and experimental studies in regional settings have been mostly employed in order to decipher which parameters control the obduction to happen and favor its feasibility. However, plate motions are driven by forces that originate in the interior of the Earth. Regional models neglect this large scale dynamics while imposing prescribed and forced compression of the system. In this study, we investigate obduction in global mantle convection models using 2D thermo-chemical numerical simulations in spherical annulus geometry. The convection models are characterised by Earth-like plate tectonics and include mobile continents. At the convergent boundaries in between oceanic and continental lithosphere, obduction is allowed to occur due to imposed free surface conditions. We investigate the setting favorable for the emplacement of denser rock on top of the lighter continent and the impact of large scale forces on obduction. We then vary critical parameters of continental strength and the thickness of the continental edges to infer how these influence the system and compare its first order characteristics with available geological record.",

            "abstract": "The ATSR Dual View (ADV) and ATSR Single View (ASV) aerosol retrieval algorithms have been developed for use with the Along Track Scanning Radiometer ATSR-2 which flew on the ERS-2 satellite (1995-2003) and the Advanced ATSR (AATSR) which flew on the ENVISAT satellite (2002-2012) (both from the European Space Agency, ESA). The ATSR instruments provide two views: one near-nadir and the other at 55 degrees forward. Each view provides the radiances at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in 7 wavebands from the visible (VIS) to the thermal infrared (TIR) which are used for the retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties. The dual view algorithm provides information on the aerosol properties over land with a quality which is similar to that of other satellites. Using the dual view, no prior knowledge is needed on surface properties to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) which thus can be used in the atmospheric correction to provide the surface reflectance as an independent parameter. Over ocean the AOD is retrieved in a single view, also with a quality similar to that of other instruments. The ATSR-2/AATSR combination provides a time series of 17 years, which will be further expanded with those from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on the ESA/EU GMES Sentinel-3 mission planned to be launched in the autumn of 2015. The retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties in the same scene can be used to obtain information on aerosol-cloud interaction. In the presentation an overview will be presented of the aerosol and cloud remote sensing activities in Helsinki, in particular algorithm improvement to deal with differences in aerosol loading, aerosol type and reflectance of the underlying surface. Procedures developed for areas where many independent validation data are available but where the AOD is relatively low (USA, Europe) are revisited for their use over areas with much higher AOD. An initial analysis will be presented to illustrate the spatial and temporal variations in different parts of the world, contrasting the temporal behaviour over different continents.",

            "abstract": "Total solar eclipse observations are snapshots of the instantaneous dynamic state of the corona, and each observation never fails to yield surprises. Occurring at the declining phase of solar cycle 24, the 20 March 2015 total solar eclipse was no exception. Images taken through narrow bandpass filters centered on the Fe XIV 530.3 nm and Fe XI 789.2 nm coronal emission lines, showed a corona dominated by strong Fe XIV emission, with a peak ionization temperature of 1.8 MK, and with weak Fe XI emission at 1.1 MK, present mostly over the two poles. Simultaneous imaging spectroscopy through a dual channel high-resolution spectrometer, centered on these two wavelengths, revealed Doppler red shifts exceeding 1000 km/s in the extended corona, covering a distance range of up to 1.5 solar radii above the solar surface. These redshifts together with the observed Doppler broadening could be assigned to specific coronal structures, which were observed simultaneously in high resolution white light images. By comparing these observations with contemporaneous observations from SDO, SWAP/Proba2 and LASCO/C2 and C3, the dynamics of the coronal plasma, as well as its thermodynamics, could be mapped in a region of space, untenable to present-day observatories. These latest eclipse observations underscore the unique scientific opportunities accessible with similar instrumentation during the all-american 21 August 2017 total solar eclipse.",

            "abstract": "Convective flow in the mantle and the motions of tectonic plates produce deformation of the Earth’s interior, and the rock fabric produced by this deformation can be discerned using anisotropy of seismic wavespeed. This deformation is particularly prevalent within the oceanic asthenosphere, including near seafloor-spreading centers as new plates are formed via corner flow, and within a weak asthenosphere that lubricates large-scale plate-driven flow and/or accommodates smaller-scale convection. Seismic models of oceanic upper mantle are conflicting regarding the relative importance of these deformation processes. Seafloor-spreading fabric is very strong just beneath the Moho at relatively local scales. At ocean-basin scales, the strongest fabric in the asthenosphere, and the relative importance of density-driven flow and plate-induced shear is ambiguous. Using Rayleigh waves recorded across the NoMelt ocean-bottom seismograph (OBS) array in the central Pacific, we provide a unique high-resolution constraint on seismic anisotropy within the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system in the middle of a plate. Shear-velocity and conductivity profiles delineate a dry, high-velocity lid overlying a damp, weak asthenosphere. Azimuthal anisotropy is strongest within the lid, with fast direction coincident with seafloor spreading, consistent with Pn observations. Minimum azimuthal anisotropy occurs within the lowest-velocity (weakest) portion of the asthenosphere, and below which it increases to a secondary maximum. In no depth range does the fast direction correspond to apparent plate motion. The results suggest that the dominant deformation in the oceanic mantle occurs during corner flow at the ridge axis, and via pressure- and/or buoyancy-driven flow within the asthenosphere, possibly within a non-Newtonian low-viscosity channel. Shear associated with motion of the plate over the underlying asthenosphere, if present, is weak compared to these processes.",

These light elements place important constraints on the depth of the primordial magma ocean(s), the chemical potentials of many of these elements in coexisting phases during differentiation, the temperature of the inner core boundary, and the composition of the bulk Earth.\nThe P-wave velocity, Earth's mass deficit, and depth of the inner core boundary place two important constraints on the chemical composition of the core, but there are multiple trade-offs which cannot be resolved using seismology alone.\nIn this study, we use a large experimental partitioning dataset to build activity-composition models for light elements in metallic melts in equilibrium with oxide and silicate phases (both solid and liquid). We avoid the use of epsilon models, which commonly fail at solute concentrations above a few weight percent. Instead we employ a modified subregular solution model, using intermediate species to calculate excess free energies of mixing. Flexible models like these are required to fit the experimental data which spans 0 – 100 GPa and 1500 – 5500 K. Several heuristics are used to reduce the number of free parameters where they are not independently constrained.\nWe use our models to investigate the conditions of core formation and the chemical composition of the Earth's core using the approach of Rubie et al.

The two earthquakes struck a densely populated region, causing 26 fatalities and significantly damaging the economy of the region. We image the rupture history of these events, by separately and jointly inverting strong motions, GPS displacements and High-Rate GPS data. The region of interest is a sedimentary basin (the Po Plain) surrounded by the northern Apennines; and it is characterized by a significant presence of fluid and strong heterogeneities leading to remarkable site effects and liquefaction phenomena; for these reasons we adopt an ad-hoc velocity profiles at each station, by inverting in a low-intermediate frequency band (0 - 0.25 Hz). We use a two-stage non-linear inversion technique that, rather than simply looking at the best model, extracts the most stable features of the earthquake rupture that are consistent with the data and gives an estimate of the variability of each model parameter. During the first stage, an algorithm based on the heat-bath simulated annealing generates an ensemble of models that efficiently sample the good data-fitting regions of parameter space. In the second stage the algorithm performs a statistical analysis of the ensemble providing us the best-fitting model, the average model, and the associated standard deviation, coefficient of variation, moda and median distributions. The goal of our work is to constrain the earthquake rupture history and to assess the associated model uncertainty, to better understand the mechanics of the causative fault as well as the observed ground shaking.",

            "abstract": "Stream temperature controls important aspects of the riverine habitat, such as the rate of spawning or death of many fish species, or the concentration of numerous dissolved substances. In the current context of accelerating climate change, the future evolution of stream temperature is regarded as uncertain, particularly in the Alps. This uncertainty fostered the development of many prediction models, which are usually classified in two categories: mechanistic models and statistical models. Based on the numerical resolution of physical conservation laws, mechanistic models are generally considered to provide more reliable long-term estimates than regression models. However, despite their physical basis, these models are observed to differ quite significantly in some aspects of their implementation, notably (1) the routing of water in the river channel and (2) the estimation of the temperature of groundwater discharging into the stream. For each one of these two aspects, we considered several of the standard modeling approaches reported in the literature and implemented them in a new modular framework. The latter is based on the spatially-distributed snow model Alpine3D, which is essentially used in the framework to compute the amount of water infiltrating in the upper soil layer. Starting from there, different methods can be selected for the computation of the water and energy fluxes in the hillslopes and in the river network. We relied on this framework to compare the various methodologies for river channel routing and groundwater temperature modeling. We notably assessed the impact of each these approaches on the long-term stream temperature predictions of the model under a typical climate change scenario. The case study was conducted over a high Alpine catchment in Switzerland, whose hydrological and thermal regimes are expected to be markedly affected by climate change. The results show that the various modeling approaches lead to significant differences in the model predictions, and that these differences may be larger than the uncertainties in future air temperature. It is also shown that the temperature of groundwater discharging into the stream has a marked impact on the modeled stream temperature at the catchment outlet.",

            "abstract": "The number of forest fires and accompanying human injuries and physical damages has been increased by frequent drought. In this study, forest fire danger zone of Korea is estimated to predict and prepare for future forest fire hazard regions. The MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) model is used to estimate the forest fire hazard region which estimates the probability distribution of the status. The MaxEnt model is primarily for the analysis of species distribution, but its applicability for various natural disasters is getting recognition. The detailed forest fire occurrence data collected by the MODIS for past 5 years (2010-2014) is used as occurrence data for the model. Also meteorology, topography, vegetation data are used as environmental variable. In particular, various meteorological variables are used to check impact of climate such as annual average temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation of dry season, annual effective humidity, effective humidity of dry season, aridity index. Consequently, the result was valid based on the AUC(Area Under the Curve) value (= 0.805) which is used to predict accuracy in the MaxEnt model. Also predicted forest fire locations were practically corresponded with the actual forest fire distribution map. Meteorological variables such as effective humidity showed the greatest contribution, and topography variables such as TWI (Topographic Wetness Index) and slope also contributed on the forest fire. As a result, the east coast and the south part of Korea peninsula were predicted to have high risk on the forest fire. In contrast, high-altitude mountain area and the west coast appeared to be safe with the forest fire. The result of this study is similar with former studies, which indicates high risks of forest fire in accessible area and reflects climatic characteristics of east and south part in dry season.\nTo sum up, we estimated the forest fire hazard zone with existing forest fire locations and environment variables and had meaningful result with artificial and natural effect. It is expected to predict future forest fire risk with future climate variables as the climate changes.",

            "abstract": "During the Late Pleistocene, present day Walker Lake, Nevada was part of Lake Lahontan, an extensive lake covering large portions of northwestern Nevada, USA. The water level of Lake Lahontan has fluctuated significantly over time, reaching maximum high stands during the last glacial maxima (MIS stages 2 and 4). Fossil stromatolites are found sixty meters above the present day shoreline of Walker Lake. Like other lacustrine sedimentary features, stromatolites are laminated and may preserve a geochemical record of their environment of formation. As accretionary growth structures, stromatolites also have the potential to preserve in situ lake conditions that constrain water depth. Preliminary petrographic analysis of Walker Lake stromatolites suggests that they have undergone minimal diagenesis and appear to contain predominantly abiogenic features. Using radiocarbon dating, we found a formation age from ~41,460 to ~35,680 (calibrated YBP, IntCal13) over 14 cm, placing the age of formation within late MIS 3--a time noted for severe climatic shifts including Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. Clumped isotope (Δ₄₇) analysis revealed large temperature fluctuation of the surrounding water column during formation of the stromatolites. Using geochemical data of conservative trace metals we modeled the fluctuation of volume of Walker Lake to be almost 50% over the course of the ~5780 years of stromatolite accretion. The Walker Lake stromatolites formed under dynamic temperature and lake level conditions. Based on both the fine laminations and overall complexity of macrostructure, the Walker Lake stromatolites show more similarities to stromatolites formed in the Proterozoic then to modern day stromatolites. Therefore, the Walker Lake stromatolites offer an interesting and unique analog for studying stromatolite formation, climate dynamics and water chemistry in the Proterozoic.",

The stations of the array, nicknamed WIZARD, were deployed mainly north and east of the Deep Fault Drilling Program (DFDP) borehole site in Whataroa Valley (DFPD-2). WIZARD complemented the station distribution of the Southern Alps Microearthquake Borehole Array (SAMBA) operated by VUW, situated south and west of DFDP-2. Three additional temporary stations were deployed to the north and east of WIZARD by GNS Science, and four GeoNet permanent stations fell within the footprint of our study area. The main goals of the WIZARD project are to image the crustal structure in the region surrounding the DFDP-2 site, relocate earthquakes as precisely and accurately as possible, and determine focal mechanisms for the larger earthquakes, in order to characterize the Alpine Fault and its geometry at depth. Some previous studies had identified the area covered by WIZARD to be largely aseismic, but we have in fact located roughly 500 earthquakes underneath WIZARD. A new automatic S-wave picker proved to be very effective for rapidly increasing the size of our S-wave arrival dataset. Our tomographic inversion results show that significant velocity contrasts in both Vp and Vs (hanging wall fast) appear to delineate the Alpine Fault at depth in most of our study region, dipping typically about 60 degrees SE, and some focal mechanisms show oblique slip. However, we are not able to identify earthquakes that are actually occurring on the Alpine Fault with certainty based only on our location results.",

            "abstract": "Nitrification is the link between reduced and oxidized forms of inorganic nitrogen, and is therefore a crucial step in the estuarine nitrogen cycle. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms catalyze the rate-limiting step of ammonia oxidation to nitrite and thus play key roles in the biogeochemical cycling nutrient-rich estuaries. Yet, few studies have measured nitrification rates in tandem with ammonia oxidizer functional gene (amoA) expression, abundance, and diversity in estuary waters. Here, we present a multi-year data set on the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of nitrification in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, the largest estuary on the North American west coast, collected throughout all regions of the estuary from 2012 to 2014. Data on microbial community distributions use functional gene-based PCR assays to assess the diversity, abundance, and mRNA expression of ammonia oxidizers, while stable isotope tracer experiments were used to measure nitrification rates. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) typically outnumbered ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) throughout the sampled gradient, though the relative abundance of AOB was often greater in brackish regions. mRNA expression of amoA appeared to largely track DNA abundance, but suggested only a fraction of the ammonia-oxidizing community was typically active. AOA were always numerically dominant in the Sacramento River, where average nitrification rates were highest, suggesting the AOA communities in this river are responsible for a relatively constant nitrification hotspot. Additionally, depth profiles of nitrification rates suggested high biogeochemical activity near the sediment-water interface in samples with abnormally high turbidity, indicating similar but transient nitrification hotspots in bottom waters containing resuspended sediments. This work increases our knowledge of the ecology and dynamics of ammonia oxidizers in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, with time series data allowing for the putative identification of regions of persistent or transiently high nitrogen cycling rates.",

            "abstract": "The emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province during the late Triassic and early Jurassic is implicated in the end-Triassic mass extinction and is associated with dramatic increases in atmospheric pCO2. Changes in the isotopic composition of CO2 as recorded on land and in the ocean have been observed in many sections worldwide, but the timing and causes of the changes are debated. Recent high-resolution ash bed dating (Schaltegger et al., 2008; Schoene et al., 2010; Guex et al., 2012; Wotzlaw et al., 2014) from a continuous Rhaetian-Hettangian section near Levanto, Peru, provide an opportunity to understand the duration of these carbon cycle disruptions, and ammonite biostratigraphy allows comparison to other sections. We measured % organic carbon and % inorganic carbon along with δ13Corganic and δ13Ccarbonate at the section near Levanto. We find a series of δ13Corganic excursions that are similar to those found in other Triassic-Jurassic successions, both from the Tethyan (St. Audrie’s Bay, UK) and Panthalassic oceans (Kennecott Point, CAN), pointing to the global extent of these changes. At Levanto, we can identify a brief, initial positive carbon isotope excursion followed first by a sharp negative excursion that coincides with the last appearance of Triassic ammonites, and then a more extended positive carbon isotope excursion that extends into the initial Jurassic recovery. Using the ash bed dates from Levanto, we are able for the first time to estimate robustly the duration of each carbon isotope excursion across the Triassic-Jurassic interval. These estimates of durations aid in our understanding of timing and causes of carbon cycle perturbations associated with the emplacement of CAMP and its relation to mass extinction.",

            "abstract": "Experiments were performed under various reducing conditions to evaluate the transport behavior of technetium-99 (99Tc) in the presence of sandy clay loam soil from the Savannah River Site (SRS) and goethite, magnetite, and iron sulfide, which were selected for their increasing reducing potential. The experiments were conducted to investigate how redox reaction equilibria and rates affect the overall mobility of 99Tc as it transitions between the mobile Tc(VII) and immobile Tc(IV). Under oxygen-rich conditions, batch sorption isotherms measured for TcO4- across the concentration range 0.5 to 50 μg/L were linear with distribution coefficients (Kd) of 0.78 mL/g or lower, with decreasing sorption for goethite, magnetite, and iron sulfide, respectively. Addition of Na2S resulted in a marked increase in apparent 99Tc sorption to the solid phase, with Kd of 43 mL/g, 35 mL/g, and 29 mL/g, following the same mineral trend as previously. The increased Kd values are possibly due to reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV), resulting in the formation of TcO2(s). SRS soil batch sorption isotherms measured for TcO4- across the same concentration range were also linear, with Kd of 0.7 mL/g for unadjusted pH, 5.1 mL/g for pH of around 6, and 6.7 mL/g for pH of around 4. Kinetic batch sorption tests showed less than 10% 99Tc sorption in an oxidizing environment and greater than 95% sorption in a reducing environment, with both reactions occurring on the order of minutes. In contrast, desorption experiments initiated by transferring the samples from a reducing environment (0.1% H2(g)/99.9% N2(g)) to atmospheric conditions resulted in a slow desorption step on the order of days. Column experiments conducted with the SRS sands indicate a retardation factor of 1.17 for 99Tc under oxygen rich conditions. Additional column experiments are being conducted to evaluate 99Tc transport dependencies on transitions between oxygen rich and poor conditions.",

            "abstract": "Large volcanic eruptions can have major impacts on global climate affecting both atmospheric and ocean circulation through changes in atmospheric chemical composition and optical properties. The residence time of volcanic aerosol from strong eruptions is around 2-3 years and attention has consequently focused on their short-term impacts, and in particular on tropical eruptions. The long-term, ocean-mediated response has been less studied and large uncertainties remain. Moreover, studies have largely focused on tropical eruptions; high-latitude eruptions have drawn less attention because their impacts have been thought to be merely hemispheric rather than global and no study has hitherto investigated the long-term effects of such eruptions. Here we use a climate model to show that large summer high-latitude eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere could cause an El Niño-like anomaly in the equatorial Pacific during the first 8-9 months after the start of the eruption owing to a strong hemispheric cooling (Fig. 1). The hemispherically asymmetric cooling shifts the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone southwards, triggering a weakening of the trade winds over the western and central equatorial Pacific that begets an El Niño-like anomaly. The eruption also leads to a strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the first twenty-five years after the eruption, followed by a weakening lasting at least 35 years. The long-lived changes in the AMOC strength also alter the variability of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (Fig. 2).",

            "abstract": "Cone-in-cone is an enigmatic structure. Similar to many fibrous calcite veins, cone-in-cone is generally formed of calcite and present in bedding-parallel vein-like accumulations within fine-grained rocks. Unlike most fibrous veins, cone-in-cone contains conical inclusions of host-rock material, creating nested, parallel cones throughout. A long-debated aspect of cone-in-cone structures is whether the calcite precipitated with its conical form (primary cone-in-cone), or whether the cones formed afterwards (secondary cone-in-cone). Trace dolomite within a calcite cone-in-cone structure from the Cretaceous of Jordan supports the primary hypothesis. The host sediment is a siliceous mud containing abundant rhombohedral dolomite grains. Dolomite rhombohedra are also distributed throughout the cone-in-cone. The rhombohedra within the cones are randomly oriented yet locally have dolomite overgrowths having boundaries that are aligned with calcite fibers. Evidence that dolomite co-precipitated with calcite, and did not replace calcite, includes (i) preferential downward extension of dolomite overgrowths, in the presumed growth-direction of the cone-in-cone, and (ii) planar, vertical borders between dolomite crystals and calcite fibers. Because dolomite overgrows host-sediment rhombohedra and forms fibers within the cones, it follows that the host-sediment was included within the growing cone-in-cone as the calcite precipitated, and not afterward. The host-sediment was not injected into the cone-in-cone along fractures, as the secondary-origin hypothesis suggests. This finding implies that cone-in-cone in general does not form over multiple stages, and thus has greater potential to preserve the chemical signature of its original precipitation. Because cone-in-cone likely forms before complete lithification of the host, and because the calcite displaces the host material against gravity, this chemical signature can preserve information about early overpressures in fine-grained sediments.",

            "abstract": "The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region is one of the most advanced economic districts in China, which has experienced remarkable economic development and urbanization in the past two decades. Accompanied with the rapid economy development and urbanization, the PRD region encountered both severe nitrogen pollution and deposition. In this study, the characteristics of nitrogen deposition and impacts of urbanization on nitrogen deposition in the PRD region were investigated by combining the methods of field study and numerical model.\nAccording to the field measurements, the total dry and wet atmospheric deposition of reactive N at a urban site (SYSU) was up to 55.0 kg ha-1 yr-1 in 2010, slightly lower than the results at a rural forest site (DHS) (57.6 kg ha-1 yr-1). Wet deposition was the main form of the total deposition (64-76%). Organic nitrogen (ON) was found to be dominant in the total N deposition, with a contribution of 53% at DHS and 42% at SYSU. NH4+-N and NO3--N accounted for a similar portion of the total N deposition (23-29%). Atmospheric nitrogen deposition was further simulated by using the improved WRF-Chem model. The simulated N deposition flux was high in the north of PRD (i.e., Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhaoqing) and relative low in the east (Huizhou) and south (Zhuhai), with an average N deposition flux of about 24 kg ha-1 yr-1 for the whole PRD. The distribution of N dry deposition was mainly controlled by the concentration of reactive N compounds and precipitation governed the wet deposition distribution. The modeling results also indicate that the PRD area is the source region in which the emissions exceed the deposition while the outside area of the PRD is the receptor region in which the deposition exceeds emissions.\nThe impact of emission change and land use change due to urbanization was also investigated using the WRF-Chem model. The results showed that atmospheric N deposition exhibits a direct response to emission change while the land use change impacts the atmospheric N deposition indirectly mainly through the modification of precipitation. As a result of great challenges in reduction of the reactive N emission, a scenario of rising N deposition in the PRD cannot be discarded in the future.",

            "abstract": "This paper focuses on the evolution of the fracture permeability due to water-granite long-term interactions when deionized water flows through the fracture surface. Laboratory-scale batch experiments have been conducted by Yasuhara et al (2011), wherein artificial fractures are subject to a mechanical confining pressure, variable differential hydraulic pressures and different applied temperatures. The aqueous geochemical system involved in the chemical weathering of granite is investigated in the first place which is a mixture of several kinetic reactions corresponding to mineral dissolution and a series of equilibrium reactions corresponding to potential derivatives in the aqueous solution. As fracture surfaces are in contact under confining stress, mineral dissolution rates may be different at hydrostatically stressed open pore and at asperity contacts under non-hydrostatic stress. Especially at asperity contacts, intergranular pressure solution may accelerate mineral dissolution rates whose driving force is represented as the chemical potential difference between a stressed contact and a hydrostatically stressed open pore (Taron and Elsworth (2010)). To better understand dominant mechanisms in the system, a reactive transport model including both the free-face reactions and the pressure solution is developed in the open-source simulator OpenGeoSys. Fracture aperture is updated as a result of the mass removal from the open-pore walls and the contacting asperities. The study presents impacts of mineral composition and their spatial distribution on the permeability evolution.\n",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover (MSL) are proxies for field geologists on Mars, taking high resolution imagery of rock formations and landscapes which is analysed in detail on Earth. Panoramic digital cameras (PanCam on MER and MastCam on MSL) are used for characterising the geology of rock outcrops along rover traverses. A key focus is on sedimentary rocks that have the potential to contain evidence for ancient life on Mars. Clues to determine ancient sedimentary environments are preserved in layer geometries, sedimentary structures and grain size distribution. The panoramic camera systems take stereo images which are co-registered to create 3D point clouds of rock outcrops to be quantitatively analysed much like geologists would do on Earth.\nThe EU FP7 PRoViDE project is compiling all Mars rover vision data into a database accessible through a web-GIS (PRoGIS) and 3D viewer (PRo3D). Stereo-imagery selected in PRoGIS can be rendered in PRo3D, enabling the user to zoom, rotate and translate the 3D outcrop model. Interpretations can be digitised directly onto the 3D surface, and simple measurements can be taken of the dimensions of the outcrop and sedimentary features. Dip and strike is calculated within PRo3D from mapped bedding contacts and fracture traces. Results from multiple outcrops can be integrated in PRoGIS to gain a detailed understanding of the geological features within an area.\nThese tools have been tested on three case studies; Victoria Crater, Yellowknife Bay and Shaler. Victoria Crater, in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars, was visited by the MER-B Opportunity Rover. Erosional widening of the crater produced <15 m high outcrops which expose ancient Martian eolian bedforms. Yellowknife Bay and Shaler were visited in the early stages of the MSL mission, and provide excellent opportunities to characterise Martian fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary features. Development of these tools is crucial to exploitation of vision data from future missions, such as the 2018 ExoMars Rover and the NASA 2020 mission.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 312377 PRoViDE.",

            "abstract": "Rain-on-snow (ROS) is a typical flood type in montane catchments with temperate climates in many parts of the world and their frequency will most likely increase under changing climate conditions. These flood events have been notoriously hard to predict due to their complex nature and the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal data that could be used for model evaluation and detailed investigations of how a ROS event actually develops in a catchment.\nThe presented study will focus on the spatio-temporal variability of the snow cover distribution, snowmelt energy dynamics, and runoff generation during two ROS events in December 2012 by using hourly measurements of 30 standalone snow monitoring stations set-up in a mesoscale montane catchment in the Black Forest region of southwestern Germany. A multiple linear regression analysis using elevation, aspect, and land cover as predictors for the snow water equivalent distribution within the catchment was applied on an hourly basis. The generated snowmelt water, liquid precipitation, as well as the total retention storage of the snow cover were considered in order to estimate the amount of water potentially available for runoff.\nThe study shows in a very high spatial and temporal resolution how the observed ROS floods developed in the catchment. It became evident that the distributed retention capacity of the snow cover is a crucial mechanism during ROS. Due to higher amounts of snow and increased rainfall in the higher parts of the catchment, elevation was the most important terrain feature for runoff generation. South-facing terrain contributed more water to runoff than north-facing slopes, and only slightly more runoff was generated at open compared to forested areas. The results highlight the importance of the combination of snowmelt together with liquid precipitation for the generation of flood runoff during ROS events and the large temporal and spatial variability of the relevant processes.",

            "abstract": "Novel isotope systems have the potential to provide new insights into biogeochemical cycling in Earth’s evolving oceans. However, much recent paleo-redox work has been done without extensive consideration of sample preservation or paleoenvironmental setting. Neoproterozoic reef complexes from South Australia provide a perfect setting to test geochemical redox proxies (e.g. uranium isotopes and trace metal chemistry) within a well-defined sedimentological and petrographic context. These reefs developed significant frameworks over ~1km of steep platform relief from the seafloor, and contain a variety of carbonate components including primary dolomite marine cements. Analysis of a variety of components within these reefs reveals significant variation in uranium isotope composition and trace metal chemistry between components, even within a single sample. Marine cements, which precipitated directly from seawater, have much lower contamination element concentrations (e.g. Al, Zr, Th) than depositional micrites, and appear to represent the best archive of ancient ocean conditions. These cements have high levels of Fe, Mn in shallow and deep reef facies (e.g. 2-3wt% Fe), but only Fe-oxide inclusions in peritidal settings. This distribution suggests ferruginous conditions under a surficial chemocline in this Neoproterozoic seawater. Uranium isotopes from pristine marine cements have relatively heavy values compared to modern seawater (median = -0.22 δ238U). These values are essentially unfractionated from riverine inputs, which we interpret as tracking extensive near quantitative low-T reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) by abundant soluble iron in seawater. Depositional components and late stage cements have a much lighter and more variable U isotope compositions (-0.71 to -0.08 δ238U). This work highlights the need for fundamental petrographic constraints on the preservation of depositional geochemical signatures in the future use and development of sedimentary redox proxies.",

            "abstract": "Identification and evaluation of sources of aeolian mineral dust is a critical task in the simulation of dust. Recently, time series of space based multi-sensor satellite images have been used to identify and monitor changes in the land surface characteristics. Modeling of windblown dust requires precise delineation of mineral dust source and its strength that varies over a region as well as seasonal and inter-annual variability due to changes in land use and land cover. Southwest USA is one of the major dust emission prone zone in North American continent where dust is generated from low lying dried-up areas with bare ground surface and they may be scattered or appear as point sources on high resolution satellite images. In the current research, various satellite derived variables have been integrated to produce a high-resolution dust source mask, at grid size of 250 m, using data such as digital elevation model, surface reflectance, vegetation cover, land cover class, and surface wetness. Previous dust source models have been adopted to produce a multi-parameter dust source mask using data from satellites such as Terra (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - MODIS), and Landsat. The dust source mask model captures the topographically low regions with bare soil surface, dried-up river plains, and lakes which form important source of dust in southwest USA. The study region is also one of the hottest regions of USA where surface dryness, land use (agricultural use), and vegetation cover changes significantly leading to major changes in the areal coverage of potential dust source regions. A dynamic high resolution dust source mask have been produced to address intra-annual change in the aerial extent of bare dry surfaces. Time series of satellite derived data have been used to create dynamic dust source masks. A new dust source mask at 16 day interval allows enhanced detection of potential dust source regions that can be employed in the dust emission and transport pathways models for better estimation of emission of dust during dust storms, particulate air pollution, public health risk assessment tools and decision support systems.",

            "abstract": "Although the Lichi mélange has been studied intensively over the last decade, its enigmatic nature has generated debates regarding its origin and evolution. Two prominent models have been proposed to explain the Lichi melange: the olistostrome model with slumping sediments and the tectonic collision model with intensive shearing. Neither model can explain what causes the interpreted slumping and complex faulting processes for the sediments. Here, we study the Lichi melange using a time-space equivalence approach, in which the tectonics of the offshore continuation of the Lichi mélange should represent an earlier stage in its evolution. Our study of marine multichannel seismic data suggested that the backthrusts in the accretionary prism propagate arcward above and within the deforming forearc and arc basement to incorporate the sediment and basement materials into the rear of the accretionary prism. Therefore, we proposed the “retrowedge evolution model” whose novel key feature is that the irregular topography of the arc basement affects the taper angle of the retrowedge. The retrowedge has a greater taper than the minimum taper of the prowedge, so the slope can be steeper, and thus favors gravitational failure. Such processes would generate complex faulting and slumping processes in the backthrusted forearc ridge and basin. In sum, this retrowedge model reconciles the mixture of slumping and faulting processes found in the Lichi mélange.",

            "abstract": "By doing topographical surveys in a reservoir, we can calculate siltation volume in the period of two measurements. It becomes basic requirement to provide more precise siltation value especially when the differential GPS positioning method and the multi-beams echo sounders have been prevailed; however, there are two problems making the result become challenging when doing the siltation-survey in reservoir. They are both relative with the difficulty in keeping survey accuracy to the area of side slope around the boundary of reservoir. Firstly, the efficiency or accuracy of horizontal positioning using the DGPS may decrease because of the satellite-blocking effect when the surveying ship nears the bank especially in the canyon type of reservoir. Secondly, measurement can only be acquired in the area covered by water using the echo sounder, such that the measuring data of side slope area above water surface are lack to decrease the accuracy or seriously affect the calculation of reservoir water volume. This research is to hold the terrain accuracy when measuring the reservoir side slope and the Sun Moon Lake Reservoir in central Taiwan is chosen as the experimental location. Sun Moon Lake is the most popular place for tourists in Taiwan and also the most important reservoir of the electricity facilities. Furthermore, it owns the biggest pumped-storage hydroelectricity in Asia. The water in the lake is self-contained, and its water supply has been input through two underground tunnels, such that a deposit fan is formed when the muds were settled down from the silty water of the Cho-Shui Shi. Three kinds of survey are conducted in this experiment. First, a close-range photogrammetry, around the border of the Sun Moon Lake is made, or it takes shoots along the bank using a camera linked with a computer running the software Pix4D. The result can provide the DTM data to the side slope above the water level. Second, the bathymetrical data can be obtained by sweeping the side-slope using the multi-beam sounder below the water surface. Finally, the image of the side-scan sonar is taken and merges with contour lines produced from underwater topographic DTM data. Combining those data, our purpose is by creating different 3D images to have good visualization checking the data of side-slope DTM surveys if they are in well qualified controlled.",

            "abstract": "Field observations and numerical modeling of ground temperatures are the main tools for understanding current and projecting future permafrost changes in the rapidly warming Arctic. Traditionally, most studies have focused on vertical fluxes of heat through the ground. Groundwater can transport heat in both lateral and vertical directions but its influence on ground temperatures at local scales in permafrost environments is not well understood. In this study field observations from a subarctic fen located within the sporadic permafrost zone are combined with numerical simulations for investigating coupled water and thermal fluxes. Ground temperature profiles and groundwater levels were observed in boreholes at the Tavvavuoma study site in northern Sweden. Based on these observations, one- and two-dimensional simulations down to 2 m depth across a gradient of permafrost conditions both within and surrounding the fen, were set up. To quantify the influence of groundwater flows on the ground temperature, two-dimensional scenarios representing the fen under various groundwater fluxes were developed. The observations suggest that lateral groundwater flows significantly affect ground temperatures. This is corroborated by modeling results that show seasonal ground ice melts 1 month earlier when a lateral groundwater flux is present. Further, although the thermal regime may be dominated by vertically conducted heat fluxes during most of the year, isolated high groundwater flow events can be potentially important for ground temperatures. Sporadic permafrost environments contain substantial portions of unfrozen ground, often with active groundwater flow paths such as fens. Knowledge of this heat transport mechanism is therefore important for understanding permafrost dynamics in these environments.",

            "abstract": "Late Cenozoic deformation zones in Japan may be divided into two types: (1) arc-arc collision zones like those of Izu and the Hokkaido axial zone, and (2) reactivated back-arc marginal rift (BMR) systems. A BMR develops during a secondary rifting event that follows the opening of a back-arc basin. It forms close to the volcanic front and distant from the spreading center of the basin. In Japan, a BMR system developed along the Sea of Japan coast following the opening of the Japan Sea. The BMR appears to be the weakest, most deformable part of the arc back-arc system. When active rifting in the marginal basins ended, thermal subsidence, and then mechanical subsidence related to the onset of a compressional stress regime, allowed deposition of up to 5 km of post-rift, deep-marine to fluvial sedimentation. Continued compression produced fault-related folds in the post-rift sediments, in thin-skin style deformation. Shortening reached a maximum in the BMR system compared to other parts of the back-arc, suggesting that it is the weakest part of the entire system. We examined the structure of the BMR system using active source seismic investigation and earthquake tomography. The velocity structure beneath the marginal rift basin shows higher P-wave velocity in the upper mantle/lower crust which suggests significant mafic intrusion and thinning of the upper continental crust. The syn-rift mafic intrusive forms a convex shape, and the boundary between the pre-rift crust and the mafic intrusive dips outward. In the post-rift compressional stress regime, the boundary of the mafic body reactivated as a reverse fault, forming a large-scale wedge thrust and causing further subsidence of the rift basin. The driver of the intense shortening event along the Sea of Japan coast in SW Japan was the arrival of a buoyant young (15 Ma) Shikoku basin at the Nankai Trough. Subduction stalled and the backarc was compressed. As the buoyant basin cooled, subduction resumed, and the rate of shortening in the marginal rift decreased. The Izu collision zone provides another example of BMR deformation where a BMR zone that formed behind the Izu-Bonin arc was strongly deformed during collision, creating an asymmetric structure around the Izu-Bonin indenter. Localization of intense deformation in the BMR zone again suggests it is the weakest part of the system.",

            "abstract": "Global re-analyses suffer from inhomogeneities, as they process data from networks under development. However, the large-scale component of such re-analyses is mostly homogeneous; additional observational data add in most cases to a better description of regional details and less so on large-scale states. Therefore, the concept of downscaling may be applied to homogeneously complementing the large-scale state of the re-analyses with regional detail – wherever the condition of homogeneity of the large-scales is fulfilled.\nTechnically this can be done by using a regional climate model, or a global climate model, which is constrained on the large scale by spectral nudging. This approach has been developed and tested for the region of Europe, and a skillful representation of regional risks – in particular marine risks – was identified. While the data density in Europe is considerably better than in most other regions of the world, even here insufficient spatial and temporal coverage is limiting risk assessments. Therefore, downscaled data-sets are frequently used by off-shore industries.\nWe have run this system also in regions with reduced or absent data coverage, such as the Lena catchment in Siberia, in the Yellow Sea/Bo Hai region in East Asia, in Namibia and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Also a global (large scale constrained) simulation has been. It turns out that spatially detailed reconstruction of the state and change of climate in the three to six decades is doable for any region of the world.\nThe different data sets are archived and may freely by used for scientific purposes. Of course, before application, a careful analysis of the quality for the intended application is needed, as sometimes unexpected changes in the quality of the description of large-scale driving states prevail.",

            "abstract": "The net effects of soil erosion by water, as a sink or source of atmospheric CO2, are decisively affected by the spatial re-distribution and stability of eroded soil organic carbon (SOC). The deposition position of eroded SOC, into terrestrial or aquatic systems, is actually decided by the transport distances of soil fractions where the SOC is stored. In theory, the transport distances of aggregated soil fractions are related to their settling velocities under given layer conditions. Yet, little field investigation has been conducted to examine the actual movement of eroded soil fractions along hillslopes, let alone the re-distribution pattern of functional SOC fractions.\nEroding sandy soils and sediment were sampled after a series of rainfall events from different topographic positions along a slope on a freshly seeded cropland in Jutland, Denmark. All the soil samples from difference topographic positions along the slope were fractionated into five settling classes using a settling tube apparatus. The SOC content, 13C signature, and C:N ratios of all settling fractions were measured. Our results show that: 1) the spatial distribution of soil settling classes along the slope clearly shows a coarsening effect at the deposition area immediately below the eroding slope, followed by a fining trend on the deposition area at the slope tail. This proves the validity of the conceptual model in Starr et al. 2000 to predict SOC redistribution patterns along eroding hillslopes. 2) The isotopically enriched 13C on the slope back suggests greater decomposition rates possibly experienced by eroded SOC during transport, while the pronounced respiration rates at the slope tail indicate a great potential of CO2 emissions after deposition. Overall, our results illustrate that immediate deposition of fast settling soil fractions, and the thus induced preferential deposition of SOC at foot slope and potential CO2 emissions during transport, must be appropriately accounted for in current soil carbon balances. To achieve this, a SOC erodibility parameter based on the actual settling velocity distribution of eroded fractions (aggregated or not aggregated) is urgently needed to better parameterize soil erosion models with respect to SOC spatial redistribution.",

            "abstract": "The North American monsoon (NAM) is the principal driver of summer severe weather in the Southwest U.S. Monsoon convection typically initiates during daytime over the mountains and may organize into mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Most monsoon-related severe weather occurs in association with organized convection, including microbursts, dust storms, flash flooding and lightning. A convective resolving grid spacing (on the kilometer scale) model is required to explicitly represent the physical characteristics of organized convection, for example the presence of leading convective lines and trailing stratiform precipitation regions. Our objective is to analyze how monsoon severe weather is changing in relation to anthropogenic climate change. We first consider a dynamically downscaled reanalysis during a historical period 1948-2010. Individual severe weather event days, identified by favorable thermodynamic conditions, are then simulated for short-term, numerical weather prediction-type simulations of 30h at a convective-permitting scale. Changes in modeled severe weather events indicate increases in precipitation intensity in association with long-term increases in atmospheric instability and moisture, particularly with organized convection downwind of mountain ranges. However, because the frequency of synoptic transients is decreasing during the monsoon, organized convection is less frequent and convective precipitation tends to be more phased locked to terrain. These types of modeled changes also similarly appear in observed CPC precipitation, when the severe weather event days are selected using historical radiosonde data. Next, we apply the identical model simulation and analysis procedures to several dynamically downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 models for the period 1950-2100, to assess how monsoon severe weather may change in the future with respect to occurrence and intensity and if these changes correspond with what is already occurring in the historical record. The CMIP5 models we are downscaling (HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-LR) will be included as part of North American COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX). Results from this project will be used for climate change impacts assessment for U.S. military installations in the region.",

            "abstract": "The Adriatic microplate (Adria) is a key player in the geodynamics of the Western Mediterranean area because it separates two major plates, Africa and Europe, that have been converging since Late Cretaceous time. Today, Adria comprises only continental lithosphere and is surrounded by zones of distributed deformation along convergent boundaries (Alps, Apennines, Calabrian Arc, Dinarides-Hellenides,) and back-arc basins (Liguro-Provencal, Tyrrhenian). For a long time, Adria was thought to be a promontory of Africa and thus to have moved coherently with Africa. However, recent re-evaluation of geological and geophysical data from the Alps yields an independent motion path for Adria that features a significant change in the direction and rate of its motion relative to both Africa and Europe since late Cretaceous time.\nTo evaluate this, we first compare existing plate reconstructions of the Western Mediterranean to develop a best-fit model for the motion of Africa, Iberia and the Corsica-Sardinia block relative to Europe. We then use two motion models for Adria in which Adria moved either coherently or independently of Africa since late Cretaceous time. The model for independent Adria motion is further constrained by new estimates of extension and shortening in the Western Mediterranean and Northern Apennines based on field observations and recently published Moho depth maps, seismic profiles along the Gulf of Lion - Sardinian passive margins and the Northern Apennines.\nInitial results suggest that Miocene extension and opening of the Liguro-Provencal basin exceeds Miocene-to-Recent shortening related to roll-back subduction in the Northern Apennines; we attribute this to counter-clockwise rotation of the Adriatic plate with respect to Europe. Combined with the previously published estimates of shortening in the Alps, this counter-clockwise motion is predicted to have produced significantly less post-Paleogene, orogen-normal shortening in the Dinarides than previously thought. This modified motion path for Adria raises the question of what forces drive the motion of Adria; so far, the most likely explanation invokes a combination of trench suction and slab pull along the northern borders of Adria in Late Cretaceous-Paleogene time, transitional to Africa push since Early Miocene time.",

The morphologies and textures of quartz show crustiform colloform banding, massive and breccias. Microthermometric measurements were made on quartz-hosted two phases (liquid + vapor) inclusions; mean homogenization temperature range from 150°C to 340°C and ice-melting temperatures range from -0.2° to 1.6°C indicating that inclusion solutions are dilute and contain 0.35 to 2.7 equivalent wt. % NaCl. Furthermore, δ18O and δ13C values from calcite range from 3.7 to 26.6 ‰ and -7.5 to 0.3‰, respectively. The presence of platy calcite and adularia indicate that boiling condition existed.

            "abstract": "Building high-resolution models of elastic properties from the Earth's lithosphere is essential to improve our understanding of tectonic processes in the deep crust and the upper mantle. Up to now, conventional imaging methods such as traveltime tomography and receiver function analysis suffer either from a lack of spatial resolution in the tomographic velocity model or from inaccuracies of the reflectivity images. Nowadays, deployment of dense networks of broadband stations and advances in high-performance computing open new perspectives to overcome these limitations by applying full-waveform inversion (FWI) to teleseismic wavefields. FWI consists in using the full information content in the data by fitting the full seismograms, namely, the phase and amplitude of each arrival transmitted across or reflected from the lithospheric heterogeneities. Combining the transmission and reflection propagation regimes (or the forward- and backward scattering regimes) in the FWI is a key issue to achieve the desired spatial resolution in lithospheric imaging and to uncouple the signature of multiple classes of parameters such as P and S wavespeeds and density in the seismic wavefields.\nIn this study, we illustrate the promises and pitfalls of teleseismic FWI for high-resolution lithospheric imaging with a synthetic case study representative of the South-Western Alps. Three-dimensional elastic full waveform modeling in the lithospheric target located below the receiver array is performed with the spectral element method. A grid injection method is used to inject the teleseismic wavefield computed in a global axisymmetric earth at the boundaries of the lithospheric target. Model parameter updates involving the P and S wavespeeds as well as density are performed in the lithospheric target by quasi-Newton local optimization where the gradient of the misfit function is computed with the adjoint-state method. The footprint of several experimental factors such as noise, parameter leakage, unknown temporal source function, inaccurate initial model and non-even source/receiver acquisition on the FWI results will be discussed. We shall also assess a preliminary lithospheric FWI model of the South-Western Alps inferred from CIFALPS dataset against previous geophysical investigations of the area.",

Even after about 4 years since the FNDPP accident significant activities of the radionuclides have been observed over severely contaminated areas. Re-suspension of radioactive cesium from the soil and vegetation to the atmosphere has been one of significant paths for its diffusion after the accident. Although the quantitative understanding of the re-suspensions is important for the prediction of future transition of radionuclides, its mechanism, identification of aerosol species which bring radioactive cesium, and the resuspension flux have not been understood in Fukushima.\nWe are continuously measuring atmospheric concentration of Cs-134/137 radioactivity at Tsushima, Namie-town, located about 30km northwest from FNDPP with high-volume air samplers. It showed clear seasonal variation: it increase from April to June, and decreased from September to December. In winter and spring, it was weakly but positively correlated with the surface wind speed. On the contrary, it did not depend on the wind speed in summer and autumn. It also has different diurnal variation: higher activities were observed in daytime in winter/spring, while the activities were obviously higher in nighttime in summer/autumn. The size distribution of aerosols contributing to the Cs-134/137 re-suspension has been measured using cascade impactors attached with high-volume air samplers, and it also shows different features in winter/spring and summer/autumn. These results indicate that the mechanism of the Cs-134/137 re-suspension is different with the season in Fukushima. Scanning electron microscope observation showed that most of suspended coarse particles were soil particles in spring and biogenic particles in autumn. Details on the Cs-134/137 re-suspension mechanisms revealed by our observations and contribution of biogenic emission will be presented in the meeting.",

Komatiitic olivines are compared to olivines from a Devonian-Carboniferous mantle peridotite (Finero, Italy) and contemporary ocean Island basalts (OIB, from St. Helena, South Atlantic Ocean).\nThe olivine major element chemistry was determined using a JEOL JXA-8900 Superprobe at the University of Maryland. Trace element contents were determined using a Photon Machines Analyte G2 193 nm Excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Nu Instruments AttoM single collector ICP-MS at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Medium resolution mass discrimination (m/Δm = 2500, at 5% peak intensity) was leveraged to separate isobaric interferences and support accurate quantitation of elemental abundances.\nThe results show that olivines from komatiites are largely depleted in FRTM, Ga and Ge relative to the composition of the primitive mantle (FRTMPM-norm = ~0.01 - 1). All komatiitic olivines have similar mantle-normalized trace element patterns, regardless of age and/or locality. Olivines from the Finero mantle peridotite and the St. Helena OIB are similarly depleted. However, compared to komatiites, grains from Finero are enriched in Ge and distinctly depleted in Ti, V, Cr, and Ga, whereas olivines from St. Helena have overall flatter normalized trace element patterns. The distinct patterns show that olivine chemistry can be used to identify and understand the source and evolution of mantle-derived rocks. Furthermore, variable redox sensitive element ratios (e.g. V, Sc), and chalcophile element abundances (e.g. Cu) indicate a potential use of olivine FTRM chemistry to constrain mantle redox conditions and the sulfur saturation history of a magma.",

            "abstract": "According to classical plume theory, the Tristan da Cunha hotspot is thought to have played a major role in the rifting of the South Atlantic margins and the creation of the aseismic Walvis Ridge by impinging at the base of the continental lithosphere shortly before or during the breakup of the South Atlantic margins. To understand the tectonic processes of the opening of the South Atlantic, the formation of the Walvis ridge and to understand, whether Tristan da Cunha is the cause or the consequence of the rifting, a network of 26 ocean-bottom magnetotelluric stations (OBMT) (cooperation between GEOMAR Germany and the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo) and 24 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers was in operation during February 2012 and January 2013 within the framework of the project ISOLDE during the second phase of the SPP 1375. To complement the ocean-bottom network and the existing stations on Tristan da Cunha, one magnetotelluric land station and two land seismometers were installed on Nightingale Island.\nMarine magnetotelluric data is often contaminated with different levels of non-stationary noise originating from water waves, passing ships and tilt movements of the instruments. In traditional data processing, such noisy segments are removed from the time series before processing. As a consequence only a portion of data remains for response function estimation and accordingly no information about longer periods (deeper structure) remains. However, since the focus of this study is melt anomalies in the upper mantle, long period estimators of the response function are vital. To investigate which processing method yields the more reliable estimates between tens to 100 000 seconds (i.e. penetration depth from a few kilometers to approximately 600 to 800 km) for our recorded data, we applied and compared different sophisticated preprocessing and processing methods (e.g., pre-whitening, one-stage BIRRP, advanced two-stage BIRRP and multivariate EMD methods). In the poster, we present a comprehensive comparison and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different methods.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of migrating and nonmigrating tidal propagation from the troposphere and stratosphere into the mesosphere/lower thermosphere and upper thermosphere has much improved over the past few years. Yet, space-borne diagnostics of tides from single satellites like TIMED are limited to > monthly mean averages because of the slow orbit precession and the resulting local solar time coverage. Ground-based observations and whole atmosphere models on the other hand strongly suggest a short-term tidal variability on the order of a factor of two within a few days. This paper attempts to address this challenge by presenting a different approach than the conventional wavenumber/frequency Fourier fits to the satellite data: tides are diagnosed from the vertical/longitudinal structure of ascending-descending orbit node differences. This so-called “tidal deconvolution” method is applied to SABER temperature observations over one solar cycle. The resulting diurnal amplitudes and phases have an effective time resolution of approximately one week and are compared to short-term tidal diagnostics based on Fourier fits to multiple satellites and results from the NOGAPS-ALPHA, WACCM and eCMAM30 models for various tidal components. Preliminary results suggest that tidal components forced by tropical convection respond strongly to convective precipitation changes associated with the Madden-Julian-Oscillation while other nonmigrating tides show clear signatures of wave-wave interaction.",

            "abstract": "Numerous modelling papers have considered the contribution of mass flow to nutrient uptake by a single plant root, but few have evaluated its contribution at the scale of an entire root system. We derive equations for nitrogen (N) influx per unit root surface area (J) and N uptake by a single root (U) as functions of soil nitrogen supply, root-length density (RLD) and the velocity of water at the root surface (vo). This model of N uptake by a single root can be used to evaluate N uptake by an entire root system if spatial distributions are known for soil N supply, root biomass and water-uptake velocity.\nIn this paper we show that spatial distributions of RLD and vo can be estimated simultaneously under an optimisation hypothesis (MaxNup, McMurtrie et al. 2012), according to which total root mass and total water uptake are distributed vertically in order to maximise total N uptake. The MaxNup hypothesis leads to equations for optimal vertical profiles of RLD, vo, J and U, maximum rooting depth and the fraction of total available soil nitrogen taken up by the root system. Predicted values of vo are enhanced at depths where nitrogen influx per unit root surface area (J) is more sensitive to vo and diminished at depths where J is less sensitive to vo. Predicted vo is largest at the base of the root system where RLD is lowest, and is smallest in upper soil layers where RLD is highest. MaxNup thus predicts that water uptake will be distributed preferentially to soil depths where it will enhance nitrogen uptake U; this tendency will amplify the sensitivity of total N uptake to total water uptake, compared with strategies where vo is the same for all roots, or where vo is elevated for roots in upper soil layers.\n",

            "abstract": "The mixing state of black carbon is uncertain yet has a significant influence on the efficiency with which a particle absorbs light. In turn, this may make a significant contribution to the uncertainty in global model predictions of the black carbon radiative budget. Previous modelling studies that have represented this mixing state using a core-shell approach have shown that aged black carbon particles may be considerably enhanced compared to freshly emitted black carbon due to the addition of co-emitted, weakly absorbing species. However, recent field results have demonstrated that any enhancement of absorption is minor in the ambient atmosphere. Resolving these differences in absorption efficiency is important as they will have a major impact on the extent to which black carbon heats the atmospheric column.\nWe have made morphology-independent measurements of refractory black carbon mass and associated weakly absorbing material in single particles from laboratory-generated diesel soot and black carbon particles in ambient air influenced by traffic and wood burning sources and related these to the optical properties of the particles.\nWe compared our calculated optical properties with optical models that use varying mixing state assumptions and by characterising the behaviour in terms of the relative amounts of weakly absorbing material and black carbon in a particle we show a sharp transition in mixing occurs. We show that the majority of black carbon particles from traffic-dominated sources can be treated as externally mixed and show no absorption enhancement, whereas models assuming internal mixing tend to give the best estimate of the absorption enhancement of thickly coated black carbon particles from biofuel or biomass burning. This approach reconciles the differences in absorption enhancement previously observed and offers a systematic way of treating the differences in behaviour observed.",

            "abstract": "A high-resolution emission inventory of Jiangsu Province was developed for 2012, using the bottom-up method with the best available domestic emission factors and activity data incorporated. Information of over 6,000 point sources including geographical location, fuel type, burner type and removal efficiency were investigated from various available data sources. The point sources were estimated to account for 83.9%, 71.2%, 63.7% and 54.5% of the total SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions respectively. Improvement of this provincial emission inventory was assessed by comparisons with emission estimation at national level. For SO2 from power plants, NOx from transportation and PM2.5 from industry, correlation coefficients were 0.703, 0.814 and 0.335, indicated other than power plants and transportation, there was an improvement in estimation of small industrial pollution sources which were usually estimated as area sources in national emission inventory. Correlation analysis of NOx emission and tropospheric NO2 vertical column density measured by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were also conducted. The correlation coefficient rose from 0.52 to 0.57 after revisions on geographical locations of 20 large point sources. Such result indicated the local source information from Environmental Statistics should be carefully examined before it can be applied for emission inventory development. In order to assess the improvement in spatial distribution and emission estimation on air quality modeling, the provincial and national emission inventory were input to Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) simulations. Simulations performed better when emissions were updated from Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) to provincial inventory, indicating the necessity of improved spatial and temporal distribution of emissions on air quality modeling, especially for gaseous pollutants. For SO2, the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) decreased from 53.9% to -29.3% and from 81.3% to 52.3% respectively. NMB of NO2 decreased from 22.0% to -4.6%. For PM2.5 and O3, the predicted concentrations from both of the two simulations were lower than observations in heavy polluted days. This might be attributed to the deficiency of secondary pollution mechanisms in air quality model.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand the evolution of the Martian crust and mantle, we need to acquire and analyze samples of igneous rocks other than the basaltic and ultramafic lithologies represented by the majority of Martian meteorites. Recent results from the Curiosity Rover demonstrate that diverse rock types exist in some Martian sedimentary environments in the form of conglomerate components or float, some of which shed light on the nature of early Martian crust (e.g., Sautter et al., 2015). We are developing investigation strategies for the in-situ instruments that will be flown on the Mars 2020 rover. These instruments will be used to inform the sampling campaigns required for future sample return missions. To achieve this, we applied PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry), an instrument for the Mars 2020 rover mission, to the meteorite NWA 7533. This meteorite is a pairing of NWA 7034, known informally as “Black Beauty”, a new type of Martian meteorite that is broadly similar to the average composition of the Martian crust. This type of meteorite is essentially a ‘conglomerate’, with many diverse rock types, including mafic, feldspathic, and exotic rock fragments such as feldspar-ilmenite-phosphate clasts, as observed using higher-spatial resolution and higher sensitivity laboratory instruments (e.g., Agee et al., 2013; Humayun et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2015). Using PIXL, we analyzed a mm-scale cut and polished surface and applied algorithms developed by the PIXL team to semi-autonomously define and group regions containing similar lithological components (Thompson et al., 2015). PIXL data rapidly reveal distinctive zircon-bearing lithologies and feldspar-ilmenite-phosphate clasts similar to the detailed petrographic and mineralogical observations. Results suggest that PIXL readily identifies lithologies with minerals and elements (e.g., Rb and Sr) that are important for geochronology studies.",

            "abstract": "The remobilization of legacy contamination stored in floodplain sediments remains a threat to ecosystem and human health, particularly with potential changes in global precipitation patterns and flooding regimes. Vehicular and industrial emissions are often the dominant, recognized source of anthropogenic trace metal loadings to ecosystems today. However, loadings from early industrial activities are poorly characterized and potential sources of trace metal inputs. While potential trace metal contamination from these activities is recognized (e.g., the historical use of lead arsenate as a pesticide), the magnitude and distribution of legacy contamination is often unknown. This presentation reconstructs a lake sediment record of trace metal inputs from an oxbow lake in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Sediment cores were analyzed for major and trace metal chemistry, carbon to nitrogen ratios, bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility. Sediment trace metal chemistry in this approximately 250 year record (180 cm) record changes in land use and industry both in the 19th century and the 20th century. Of particular interest is early 19th century loadings of arsenic and calcium to the lake, likely attributable to pesticides and lime used in tanning processes near the lake. After this period of tanning dominated inputs, sediment barium concentrations rise, likely reflecting the onset of coal mining operations and resulting discharge of acid mine drainage to surface waters. In the 20th century portion of our record (70 -20 cm), patterns in sediment zinc, cadmium, and lead concentrations are dominated by the opening and closing of the nearby Donora Zinc Works and the American Steel & Wire Works, infamous facilities in the history of air quality regulation. The most recent sediment chemistry records periods include the enactment of air pollution legislation (~ 35 cm), and the phase out of tetraethyl leaded gasoline (~30 cm). Our study documents the impact of early industry in the Southwestern Pennsylvania region, as well as early industrial coal production/consumption on legacy trace metal contamination. This record suggests that some early industrial processes can rival more recent metal fluxes and should be carefully considered in modern assessments of legacy sediment metal contamination.",

We used twenty Landsat Thematic Mapper data sets collected between 1984 and 2011 and four Landsat Operational Land Imager data sets collected between 2013 and 2015 to examine the effect of Sandy on the New Jersey Atlantic coastal marshes between Sandy Hook and Cape May. Landsat data was unavailable between the 2011 failure of Landsat TM and the launch of Landsat OLI in April of 2013.\nPreliminary results suggest that most of the New Jersey marshes were relatively stable with some interannual variation between 1984 and 2005. Between 2006 and 2015, marsh area generally declined, with the greatest decline occurring in the small discontinuous marshes north of Barnegat Light. The marshes which were closest to where Sandy made landfall seem to have sustained less damage than the marshes north of Barnegat Light. The marshes west of the lagoon bar systems between Seaside Heights and Sandy Hook, that bore the brunt of Sandy’s storm surge (from 1.5 to 2.6 meters) and the greatest wave action (Blake et al, 2013), display an increase in pond area within the marshes. As stated above, recent increases in pond size and area as well as the overall decline in marsh coverage began before Hurricane Sandy. This suggests that the even the most at-risk marshes were not as affected by Sandy’s storm surge and waves as the barrier islands.",

Typical fertilizer application rates range from 30-120 kg N ha-1, and have the potential to introduce large amounts of N to ecosystems of the Amazon basin, which can alter greenhouse gas flux and nutrient transport to groundwater and streams.\nLittle data on the fate of added fertilizers are available in the tropics in general, especially in this critical region of agricultural expansion. Therefore, we established a field-scale experiment to evaluate the fate of N fertilizer on Tanguro Ranch in Mato Grosso, Brazil, a region of rapidly expanding soy-maize double cropping. We measured greenhouse gas fluxes (N2O, CO2, and CH4), soil N content, losses to groundwater, and corn productivity across five levels of fertilizer addition (0-200 kg N ha-1) throughout an entire growing season.\nWe found that N2O flux increased with fertilizer addition, but was only significantly higher at 200 kg N ha-1. Surface soil N content increased after fertilizer addition, but decreased within weeks, and was quickly observed in subsurface soil water. Modeling results that scale these findings to the state of Mato Grosso suggest that this land use transition could create a substantial new source of N2O and CO2 to the atmosphere and has the potential to leach N fertilizer into groundwater and downstream. It is important to maintain forest code policies that minimize these impacts.",

Consequently a novel model is needed to develop for the purpose of such a challenge. This study used conditions of climate prediction and scenario suggested by IPCC working group to simulate hydrological situation for the study area under serious climate change. The simulated uncertainty is assumed by artificially moving the boundary of the uncertainty towards worse. The well-accepted hydrological kinetic model is utilized to examine the water deficit risk. Furthermore this study further analyzed the robustness and opportuness by IGDT method to find out better adaption plan for the water resource management if the uncertainty becomes larger.",

            "abstract": "We present an analysis of a recently compiled list of magnetic clouds observed by the MESSENGER and Venus Express spacecraft. Despite their planetary focus, both spacecraft spent significant amounts of time in the solar wind, allowing transient solar wind structures such as magnetic clouds to be observed. The clouds were observed at a range of heliocentric distances (at 0.72 AU by Venus Express, and from 1 to 0.3 AU by MESSENGER) over the course of a significant fraction of a solar cycle (2006 to 2013 by Venus Express, and 2007 to 2012 by MESSENGER). Neither spacecraft carried a dedicated solar wind plasma instrument, and so the clouds have been identified using magnetic field data only: a coherent rotation of the magnetic field direction lasting for at least four hours that coincides with a field strength above that of the ambient solar wind were the primary identification criteria. The approximate orientations of the magnetic clouds relative to the solar equatorial plane have been found. We consider the frequency distribution of these orientations, and their dependence on heliocentric distance and the solar magnetic field configuration. We also use these observations, in conjunction with observations at 1 AU, to estimate the likelihood that two spacecraft will encounter the same magnetic cloud as a function of the spacecraft’s azimuthal separation.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault crosses the Marmara Sea with a direction of E-W. There are many large earthquakes repeatedly along the fault with a linkage each other. Due to recent large eastern Aegean earthquake with M6, the Marmara Sea is the “blank zone”. Japan and Turkey have a SATREPS collaborative study to clarify the structural characters, construct fault models, simulate the strong motion and tsunami, evaluate these risks with hazard maps and educate disaster prevention for local governments and residents. Our activity is one of the most basic studies, and the objectives are to clarify hypocenter locations, monitor the move, and construct fault models referring seismic/magnetotelluric structures, geodetic nature and trenching works. The target area is from western Marmara Sea to the off Istanbul area along the north Anatolian Fault.\nWe deployed ten Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBSs) between the Tekirdag Basin and the Central Basin in September, 2014. Then, we added five Japanese OBSs and deployed them at the western end of the Marmara Sea and the eastern Central Basin to extend observed area in March, 2015. The OBS has a three-component velocity sensor with a natural frequency of 4.5 Hz and a hydrophone. Japanese team have clarified seismicity around Japan using the OBS. The magnitude of the detected events is 1.0-1.5. We retrieved all 15 OBSs in July, 2015 and deployed them again on the same locations after data copy and battery maintenance.\nWe started OBS data analysis combined with land stations data. Now we detect events automatically using these data and succeeded detection of over one thousand around the north Anatolian Fault. The tentative results show heterogeneous seismicity. The western and central basins have relative high seismicity and the seismogenic zone becomes thicker rather than previous estimation. Then we will evaluate hypocenter locations with high resolution and discuss the shape of faults in each segment and their linkage.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is considered to be a fundamental factor controlling biodiversity in marine ecosystems, but precisely what role temperature plays in modulating diversity is still not clear. The deep ocean, lacking light and in situ photosynthetic primary production, is an ideal model system to test the effects of temperature changes on biodiversity. Here we synthesize current knowledge on temperature–diversity relationships in the deep sea. Our results from both present and past deep-sea assemblages suggest that, when a wide range of deep-sea bottom-water temperatures is considered, a unimodal relationship exists between temperature and diversity (that may be right skewed). It is possible that temperature is important only when at relatively high and low levels but does not play a major role in the intermediate temperature range. Possible mechanisms explaining the temperature–biodiversity relationship include the physiological-tolerance hypothesis, the metabolic hypothesis, island biogeography theory, or some combination of these. The possible unimodal relationship discussed here may allow us to identify tipping points at which on-going global change and deep-water warming may increase or decrease deep-sea biodiversity. Predicted changes in deep-sea temperatures due to human-induced climate change may have more adverse consequences than expected considering the sensitivity of deep-sea ecosystems to temperature changes.",

            "abstract": "There is a broad consensus among data centers and scientific publishers on Force 11's 'Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles'. To put these principles into operation is not always as straight forward.\nThe focus for CMIP6 data citations lies on the citation of data created by others and used in an analysis underlying the article. And for this source data usually no article of the data creators is available ('stand-alone data publication'). The planned data citation granularities are model data (data collections containing all datasets provided for the project by a single model) and experiment data (data collections containing all datasets for a scientific experiment run by a single model).\nIn case of large international projects or activities like CMIP, the data is commonly stored and disseminated by multiple repositories in a federated data infrastructure such as the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). The individual repositories are subject to different institutional and national policies. A Data Management Plan (DMP) will define a certain standard for the repositories including data handling procedures.\nAnother aspect of CMIP data, relevant for data citations, is its dynamic nature. For such large data collections, datasets are added, revised and retracted for years, before the data collection becomes stable for a data citation entity including all model or simulation data. Thus, a critical issue for ESGF is data consistency, requiring thorough dataset versioning to enable the identification of the data collection in the cited version. Currently, the ESGF is designed for accessing the latest dataset versions. Data citation introduces the necessity to support older and retracted dataset versions by storing metadata even beyond data availability (data unpublished in ESGF).\nApart from ESGF, other infrastructure components exist for CMIP, which provide information that has to be connected to the CMIP6 data, e.g. ES-DOC providing information on models and simulations and the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (DDC) storing a subset of data together with available metadata (ES-DOC) for the long-term reuse of the interdisciplinary community. Other connections exist to standard project vocabularies, to personal identifiers (e.g. ORCID), or to data products (including provenance information).",

This work discusses various approaches to investigating pore structure (both geometry and topology) of several mudrocks of leading U.S. plays (Barnett, Bakken/Three Forks, and Utica), and the presence and connection of mixed wettability associated with compositional phases. Results show that these mudrocks have very limited edge-accessible pore spaces. This is shown from low pore connectivity behavior of fluid imbibition, steep decline of edge-accessible porosity from vacuum saturation, the heterogeneous presence of only trace amount of diffusing tracers beyond a few mm from a sample edge, and limited connected pathways from high-pressure injection of traced n-decane at 414 MPa. As mudrocks contain distinct hydrophobic organic materials (e.g., kerogen), as well as hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic minerals, different nano-sized tracers in two wettability fluids (API brine and n-decane) were developed to interrogate their pore spaces and connectivity. For two molecular tracers in n-decane with the sizes of 1.393 nm×0.287 nm×0.178 nm for 1-iododecane and 1.273 nm×0.919 nm×0.785 nm for trichlorooxobis (triphenylphosphine) rhenium, much less penetration was observed for wider molecules of organic-Re in these mudrocks with median pore-throats of around 5 nm, indicating the entangling of nano-sized molecules in nanopore spaces of mudrocks. The sparse nanopore space connection within the mudrock matrix, implicated by mixed wettability, could lead to limited movement of nano-sized hydrocarbon molecules and fracture-matrix interactions in fractured reservoirs, and consequently steep initial production decline and low recovery.",

Recent studies have proposed that aqueous processing of water-soluble compounds like glyoxal and IEPOX can help explain the abundance of organosulfates, higher oxygen to carbon ratios, and SOA abundance. A comprehensive set of ambient gas- and aerosol-phase data was collected during June and July of 2013 as part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) at the Centreville, AL ground site. Both gas-phase photochemistry and aqueous-phase aerosol chemistry were modeled using a zero-dimensional box model. While it has been suggested that glyoxal can contribute to aqueous aerosol through the formation of acids and higher-molecular-weight compounds, it did not produce enhanced aqSOA concentrations. Instead, processing of aqueous glyoxal resulted in the production of gas-phase acids. AqSOA consisted almost entirely of epoxide processing products, mainly from the processing of IEPOX to methyl tetrol, and the organosulfate. In addition, the pinene oxides contributed to the formation of aqSOA, through the formation of organosulfates, diols, and organonitrates. These data are consistent with the abundance of IEPOX and pinene oxide organonitrate derived SOA seen at this site.",

            "abstract": "We report a study of 3-years occurrence variability of concentric gravity waves (CGWs) in the mesopause observed by IMAP/VISI instrument. CGWs are fascinating to be studied because of its unique characteristic that shows the direct coupling between lower and upper atmosphere. The Visible and near-Infrared Spectral Imager (VISI) of the IMAP mission was launched successfully on July 21, 2012 with H-IIB/HTV-3 and installed onto the International Space Station (ISS). IMAP/VISI is now operated in the night side hemisphere with a range of +/- 51 deg. in geographic latitude and measuring three airglow emissions of OI (630 nm), OH Meinel (730 nm) and O2 (762 nm) with a typical spatial resolution of 16 – 50 km in the nadir direction. In this study, we analyzed 3 years data taken by IMAP/VISI from October 2012 to June 2015. We found total 172 CGWs events in the O2 (762nm) airglow emissions out of 4853 data paths in 2013, 92 events out of 4809 data paths in 2014 and 46 events from 2112 data paths in 2015. The monthly occurrence probability shows a similar trend for each year, a clear seasonal dependence with the peak around March-April and August-September. The weak background winds in the middle atmosphere during the equinoxes are likely responsible for the seasonal dependence. We calculated the horizontal wavelength and radius maximum by fitting the circular wavefronts to a circle. The source of CGWs then identified from meteorological satellite data around the estimated center. The horizontal wavelength was found varying from 44-300 km and radius maximum up to 3000 km, showing that CGWs can affect large area in mesopause. In most cases, the CGWs appeared as arc-like shape instead of full circle. It indicates that the background wind filter allows the wave to propagate in a particular direction and filter out the other directions. The detailed discussion on horizontal wavelength distribution, the sources and background profiles influence on the variability of the CGWs occurrence will be presented in the seminar.",

            "abstract": "Water availability is a key factor for biogeochemical processes and determines microbial activity and functioning, and thereby organic matter decomposition in soils by affecting the osmotic potential, soil pore connectivity, substrate diffusion and nutrient availability. Low water availability during drought periods therefore directly affects microbial activity. Recurring drought periods likely induce shifts in microbial structure that might be reflected in altered responses of microbial turnover of organic matter by extracellular enzymes. To study this we measured a set of potential extracellular enzyme activity rates (cellobiohydrolase CBH; leucine-amino-peptidase LAP; phosphatase PHOS; phenoloxidase POX), in grassland soils that were exposed to extreme experimental droughts during the growing seasons of up to five subsequent years.\nDuring the first drought period after eight weeks of rain exclusion all measured potential enzyme activities were significantly decreased. In parallel, soil extractable organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations increased and microbial community structure, determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, changed. In soils that were exposed to two and three drought periods only PHOS decreased. After four years of drought again CBH, PHOS and POX decreased, while LAP was unaffected; after five years of drought PHOS and POX decreased and CBH and LAP remained stable. Thus, our results suggest that recurring extreme drought events can cause different responses of extracellular enzyme activities and that the responses change over time. We will discuss whether and to what degree these changes were related to shifts in microbial community composition. However, independent of whether a solitary or a recurrent drought was imposed, in cases when enzyme activity rates were altered during drought, they quickly recovered after rewetting. Overall, our data suggest that microbial functioning in mountain grassland is sensitive to drought, but highly resilient even after five years of drought.",

            "abstract": "While you might not be able to dispose of a body with hydrofluoric acid (HF), as fans of Breaking Bad know HF will break silicon-oxygen bonds. These dual properties make HF a powerful tool in investigations of soil organic matter (SOM).\nWhen a soil sample is treated with HF, any low molecular weight OM that was bound to mineral surfaces will be released into solution allowing study of the amount and composition of this stable SOM pool. In the work presented here, we take advantage of this property of HF to explore if different forms of SOM are becoming stabilized to mineral surfaces in terrestrial and marine environments. Difference spectra obtained from solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis of bulk and 10% HF treated soil samples suggest that in aerobic terrestrial environments alkyl-C and aryl-C compounds can dominate the mineral stabilized fraction. However, in anoxic coastal environments this fraction is dominated by O-alkyl C.\nDemineralization of soil samples with HF is often necessary for removing paramagnetic interferences and concentrating carbon prior to obtaining NMR spectra. The working assumption using dilute HF is that the resultant SOM chemistry determined by NMR spectroscopy has not been significantly biased by the HF treatment process. This assumption has been validated in several studies but also refuted in others. A second goal of this study was to revisit this critical assumption by looking at carbon loss and resulting 13C NMR chemistry from a diverse set of soils and organic materials using HF in 2% and 10% concentrations. We found that 10% HF resulted in slightly greater loss of C than 2% HF but in cases where a preferential shift in chemistry was observed it was observed in both the 2% and 10% treatments.\nThe implications of both of these findings will be discussed in the context of understanding the sources, stability and potential loss mechanisms of mineral stabilized SOM.",

            "abstract": "Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is a well-established Quaternary dating method that is conventionally used to determine the time when sedimentary grains were last exposed to daylight. Recently, a very different approach to this concept has helped develop a new technique to estimate the length of time a rock surface was exposed to daylight. When a rock surface is first exposed to daylight the charge population (and so the latent luminescence signal) trapped in its constituent minerals (e.g. quartz and feldspar) starts to decrease. This charge had accumulated due to previous exposure to natural ionizing radiation. As the surface is exposed to light for longer periods, the latent luminescence signal is reduced farther into the rock. In a rock surface which has been exposed to light for a prolonged period (decades to millennia), the remaining luminescence will be zero (fully bleached) at the surface and then increase, initially exponentially, before approaching saturation at a depth where charge detrapping due to light penetration is negligible compared to the rate of charge trapping due to the environmental dose rate. By modelling the characteristic shape of luminescence resetting with depth into rock surfaces, Sohbati et al. (2012) proposed a new surface-exposure dating technique based on OSL. Here we further develop the current model to include the effect of erosion rate on luminescence-depth profiles. By fitting the model to local known-age calibration samples, we first determine the site-specific resetting rates of the luminescence signal at rock surfaces. We then use the calibration values in a numerical model to derive the steady-state erosion rate for rocks of different mineralogy and different geological settings. The preliminary erosion rates obtained from glacial and landslide granite boulders from the Chinese Pamir Plateau are ~1 mm.ka-1, whereas active streambeds of Permian sandstone in the Grabens district of Canyonlands National Park, Utah, are eroding at rates of >10 mm.ka-1, consistent with the existing denudation rates derived from cosmogenic nuclides.",

Previous research has primarily focused on scaling of flood peaks, flood processes in catchments, and diagnosis of major events. This research seeks to fill in the gaps between the different studies, by understanding flooding mechanisms across a range of drainage basin size, accounting for precipitation patterns, antecedent soil moisture, and snow. In this study, we use over 250 sub-basins in the Ohio River basin with 60 years of observed precipitation and streamflow and simulated soil moisture and snow with a land surface model. We find that large basins sizes typically have stronger correlation with longer precipitation durations rather than shorter, and vice versa. Soil moisture plays a significant role in determining flooding, but snowmelt also influences the flood generation. Finally, we identify if characteristic precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions lead to floods over different basins sizes. These results have the potential to increase our understanding of flood generation across a range of basin scales, which can then be used to better inform flood predictions under climate change.",

            "abstract": "High resolution model forcings are required to adequately simulate snow accumulation, melt, and streamflow in mountain environments. Wind, especially the high winds that induce snow redistribution and drive turbulent heat fluxes during rain-on-snow events, have been shown to play a vital role in these processes. Yet wind observations are sparse and rarely capture the large variability present in alpine regions. High resolution (1-10km) climate data is becoming more readily available but even these data are too coarse to properly represent alpine snow processes. Much attention has been focused on downscaling precipitation and air temperature for fine resolution modeling. However there is very little in the literature that has addressed techniques for deterministically downscaling wind speeds. This work addresses means of downscaling large-scale wind products for high-resolution operational modeling purposes. Though both dynamical and statistical means are available for downscaling purposes, the time constraints imposed by operational modeling restricts this work to the latter. The statistical downscaling is done by means of terrain parameters that determine topographic position related to wind exposure and shelter. First, raw hourly wind data from ~2km and ~7km resolution weather forecasts were compared to observations at well over 100 sites located throughout the Swiss Alps. As might be expected, there was a large range of scatter between model-predicted and observed winds, and predictions at high wind sites were biased low. Terrain parameters derived from a 25m resolution DEM aptly identified high and low wind speed sites and climate model biases related to the higher resolution terrain structure. The statistical downscaling differentiated windward and leeward slopes not resolved in the climate models, reduced modeling errors, and substantially reduced biases at the all-important high wind sites.",

            "abstract": "The northern Netherlands has been regarded aseismic until the first earthquakes started in 1986, after more than 25 years of gas production from the one of the largest on-shore gas-fields in the World, the Groningen field, and accompanying smaller gas fields. Due to the shallow sources, at approximately 3 km depth, even small magnitude events cause considerable damage to buildings in the region. Since the largest recorded event in the Groningen field in 2012 with ML= 3,6, more than 30.000 damage claims were received by the mining company. Since 1995 a seismic monitoring network is operational in the region, consisting of 8 200m deep boreholes with 4 levels of 3C 4,5 Hz geophones. The network was designed for a location threshold of ML=1,5 over a 40x 80 km region. Average station separation was 20 km. At the end of 2014, 245 events have been recorded with ML ≥ 1,5, out of a total of 1100.\nSince 2003 a new mining law is in place in the Netherlands, which requires for each gas field in production a seismic risk analysis. Initially, due to the small number of events for specific fields, a general hazard (PSHA) was calculated for all gas-fields and a maximum magnitude was estimated at ML = 3,9. Since 2003 an increase in the activity rate is observed for the Groningen field, leading to the development of new models and a re-assessment of parameters like the maximum magnitude. More recently these models are extended to seismic risk, where also the fragility of the regional buildings is taken into account. Understanding the earthquake process is essential in taking mitigation measures. Continued research is focused on reducing the uncertainties in the hazard and risk models and is accompanied by an upgrade of the monitoring network.\nIn 2014 a new dense network was designed to monitor the Groningen gas field in this region (30*40 km) with an average separation of 4 km. This allows an improved location threshold (M>0,5) and location accuracy (50-100m). A detailed P- and S- velocity model is available for the region. In total 70 new 200m deep boreholes will be operational in 2015. At each borehole an accelerometer will be placed at the surface. In addition two deep downhole tools (3 km depth) are operational since 2013 and 4 broad-band sensors (STS-5) at 100m depth will be installed, covering the gas field.",

            "abstract": "Watershed transit time distributions (TTDs) are a powerful tool for understanding and modeling hydrologic transport. Lumped TTD models in the literature often estimate transit times by assuming that all water in the storage zone has an equal probability of being \"selected\" into discharge, such that the proportion of young water in discharge tends to decrease as total catchment storage increases. Recent work however used a novel ranked StorAge Selection (rSAS) modeling framework to identify an \"inverse storage effect\" at a small watershed in Plynlimon, Wales, in which the proportion of young water in discharge increases with catchment storage, presumably as the result of new storage occurring preferentially in more mobile zones. In this study we test the hypothesis that this inverse storage effect has significant implications on the estimated sensitivity of watershed transit times to rainfall variability. Three sets of rainfall scenarios are fed into a hydrological model coupled to the rSAS lumped transport model to estimate the relationship between rainfall variability and the fraction of young water (<2 months old) in discharge. The rainfall scenarios include (1) historic rainfall with incrementally smoothed variability, (2) stochastically generated rainfall with ranges of parameterized variability, and (3) future rainfall projections from downscaled GCMs under different emissions scenarios. We present model results quantifying the fraction of young water at different time scales (e.g., seasonally, yearly) that can be attributed to different aspects of rainfall variability (e.g., within-event rainfall distribution, seasonality) while controlling for total rainfall intensity and the strength of the inverse storage effect. Initial findings suggest that failure to account for the inverse storage effect at our study site could lead to significant underestimation of the influence of historic and plausible future rainfall variability on watershed transit times.",

In this study we successfully carried out a fully coupled fine-scale CLM-PFLOTRAN soil biogeochemical (BGC) RT model simulation on Titan at 2.5mx2.5m resolution for the Area C of 100mx100m in the NGEE-Arctic Intensive Study Sites, Barrow, AK. The Area spatially varies in terms of plant function types (PFT) and soil thermal-hydraulic properties associated with locally polygonal landscape features. The spatially explicit CLM-PFLOTRAN coupled RT model allows soil N nutrient mobility driven either by diffusion or by advection or both. The modeling experiments are conducted with three soil nutrient N (NH4+ and NO3-) mobility mechanisms within the CLM-PFLOTAN: no transport, diffusion only, and diffusion and advection in 3-D soils.\nIt shows that CLM-PFLOTRAN model simulated higher SOM C density in both lower troughs and neighbored areas when transport mechanism allowed, compared to no-transport, although with similar ranges (about 0.1~20 kgC m-3). It also simulates slightly higher LAI (0.16~0.84 vs. 0.11~0.85) in growing season, especially in lower troughs and neighbored regions. It's likely because CLM-PFLOTRAN can explicitly simulate transport of nutrients and others both vertically and laterally. So it can more mechanically mimic plant root N extract caused relatively low concentration in root zone and thus allow transport from surrounding high N concentration regions. The lateral mobility also implies that N nutrient can transport from initially high-production columns to the neighbored low-production area where then production could be improved. The results suggest that taking account of locally mobility of soil N nutrients may be critical to plant growth and thus long-term soil organic carbon stocks in this polygonal coastal tundra ecosystem at fine scale. It also implies that regional or global scale modelings should consider vertical transport (2D) due to shallow soil root zones, for which a feature in CLM-PFLOTRAN is available as well.",

            "abstract": "The study of heat transport in porous media is important for applications such as the use of temperature as environmental tracer, geothermal energy, fuel cells, etc. In recent years, there have been several advances in computational techniques that have allowed to investigate different processes in porous media at the pore-scale through detailed numerical simulations that considered synthetic porous media formed by regular grains and pore bodies arranged in different geometrical configurations. The main objective of this research is to investigate the influence of pore configurations on flow velocity and heat transport in 2D saturated porous media. We use OpenFOAM to solve flow and heat transport equations at the pore-scale. We performed detailed pore-scale numerical simulations in synthetic 2D porous media generated from regularly placed and randomly distributed circular solid grains. For each geometrical configuration we performed numerical simulations to compute the flow field in order to calculate properties such as as tortuosity, mean velocity and hydraulic conductivity, and to identify Lagrangian coherent structures to charaterize the velocity fields. We then perform heat transport simulations to relate the properties of the velocity fields and the main heat transport mechanisms. The analysis of the simulations results showed that in all the simulated configurations effective flow properties become valid at scales of 10 to 15 pore bodies. For the same porosity and boundary conditions we obtained that as expected tortuosity in the random structure is higher than in the regular configurations, while hydraulic conductivity is smaller for the random case. The results of heat transport simulations show significant differences in temperature distribution for the regular and random pore structures. For the simulated boundary and initial conditions, heat transport is more efficient in the random structure than in the regular geometry. This result indicates that the simulated pore-geometry can have a large influence on effective parameters such as torutosity and heat transport parameters derived from results of pore-scale simulations, hence the generalization of those results to general pore geometries may be difficult or impossible.",

Out of the ALOS-2's four mission objectives, the forest observation program of the JAXA's crucial science program monitors globally the natural forest coverage and its temporal variation, which is being decreased due to the increased human activity since the last century. Use of the L-band SAR for the forest monitoring is more advantageous than the other method because of its all weather observation capability at the cloudy and the rainy area in the pan tropical regions. Using all the archives of PALSAR (2007-2010), JAXA has created the L-band SAR based forest/non-forest dataset and opened to the public (2014), as that the global forest area has the 38,000,000km2 agreeing with the Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) at less than 5% discrepancy. ALOS was terminated on April 22 2011 after the five years mission operation. In year 2014, the forest monitoring activity using the PALSAR-2 has been resumed and achieved the 79% of the global land observation using the PALSAR-2. In 2015, the remaining 21 % would be observed from summer season (starting from June). Use of 2014-2015 all PALSAR-2 archives will be compiled to clarify the decadal forest cover change of 2007-2014/15. In this presentation, the updated forest coverage using the PALSAR-2 will be introduced.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous uptake of dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5, to aerosol is one of the most important reactions controlling the global budget of nitrogen oxides, with subsequent impacts on oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl radical. Nearly all global chemical models assume that this uptake proceeds through hydrolysis to produce nitric acid, effectively a terminal sink for nitrogen oxides. However, recent field studies have shown that the yield of nitryl chloride, ClNO2, from N2O5 uptake is significant in many locations. Because ClNO2 photolyzes subsequent to its nighttime production to recycle NO2 and produce atomic chlorine, a potent oxidant, the impact of heterogeneous N2O5 uptake and the role of ClNO2 on the scale and distribution of oxidants need to be re-assessed. Here we present simulations using CAM-Chem incorporating halogen chemistry (tropospheric and stratospheric, including geographic and time varying VSLs precursor emissions) along with different assumptions for the magnitude and spatial distribution of ClNO2 yields from N2O5. The model shows the largest effects of ClNO2 production on tropospheric ozone during northern hemisphere late winter and early spring. Simulations are compared to observations from recent field campaigns, including ClNO2 and N2O5 from the Wintertime INvestigation of Transport, Emissions and Reactivity (WINTER) study on the NSF / NCAR C-130 aircraft on the U.S. East Coast in February and March of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Most of the studies on rifted margins have shown that the classical predictions of models assuming a “homogeneous” mantle lithosphere without some inheritance are unable to capture the observed large variety of magmatic budgets as a function of extension. More recently, new ideas and concepts have been developed to understand the evolution of the mantle lithosphere in hyper-extended magma-poor rifted margins that are mainly based on observations from the present-day Iberia-Newfoundland and ancient Alpine Tethys rifted margins and the Pyrenean systems. In contrast to the classical assumption assuming a simple, isotropic mantle lithosphere, these new models integrate observations from exposed and drilled mantle rocks and propose that the mantle lithosphere evolved and was modified during an extensional cycle from post-orogenic collapse through several periods of rifting to embryonic oceanic (ultra-) slow seafloor spreading. But it is, at present, unclear how far these ideas can be generalized and if they can explain the nature of mantle rocks observed across Western Europe and, in a more general way, at Atlantic type rifted margins.\nWe review the available mantle data from Western Europe, i.e. ophiolite massifs, xenoliths and dredged samples, revisit the available terminology concerning mantle massifs and xenoliths and compile the available data to identify different mantle domains. We define chemical and petrological characteristics of mantle domains based on clinopyroxene and spinel compositions and compile them on present-day and paleo-geographic maps of Western Europe. Finally we link the observed distribution of mantle domains to the post-Variscan extensional cycle and link domains to processes related to the late post-Variscan extension, the rift evolution and refertilization associated to hyper-extension and the development of embryonic oceanic domains.",

To facilitate comparisons and examine the same time period, the profiles were truncated at 300 m. The ground surface temperature (GST) histories for the last 500 years were inverted from the subsurface temperature anomalies using singular value decomposition for a model of 10 temperature changes along time-intervals of increasing duration. The inversion retains four singular values and accounts for the data acquisition time difference. The reference surface temperature and geothermal gradient were estimated by linear regression to the deepest 100 meters with a 95% confidence interval. Additionally, a Monte-Carlo method was used to find the range of solutions within a maximum subsurface anomaly error determined by the root mean square between the model and the data. The GST history results for North America, given by the mean and 95% confidence interval, reveal in most cases, a warming up to 1°C - 2.5°C during the last 100-150 years.",

            "abstract": "The subglacial topography of Antarctica is critical input data for ice sheet models and for understanding the geological, geomorphic and glacial history of the continent. Recent compilations of direct measurements using radar and gravity, published as Bedmap (version 2 is current), have improved the coverage, resolution and visualization of the sub-ice-sheet bedrock, but many regions remain poorly mapped. Here we present a new technique that uses continent-wide ice sheet surface morphology from satellite imagery data (a series of MODIS mosaics), surface topography, and surface ice flow velocity to estimate the elevation of the Antarctic bed. The analysis is based upon an inversion of the driving stress equation with corrections for temperature and plasticity. We test a number of versions of the input data sets at various resolutions to find data and scaling that best replicate well-mapped areas of Bedmap2, or match Radio Echo Sounding data not incorporated in Bedmap. Results comparing Bedmap2 cells over East Antarctica to a modelled output based upon the MOA mosaic and ice velocity, show a 0.81 r2 correlation with a standard deviation of 898m. The technique works best in areas of moderate flow and thin to moderate ice thickness. In such areas, especially where present RES data is lacking or sparse, the model provides hitherto unrevealed detail. These data could be used to supplement existing Bedmap models, improve geomorphological knowledge of the continent, target areas for detailed field survey, and inform field survey design. The Recovery Glacier region, highlighted below, is an example of such an area.",

            "abstract": "Springtime Asian dust storms events, typically originating in the Gobi Desert or Taklamakan Desert, produce particles that can be carried aloft eastward for thousands of miles. As a result, the radiative properties of these particles can significantly affect global climate. Here, we determine the optical properties of particles identified as Asian dust at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, (MLO) based on the composition and actual shapes of individual particles. Samples of particulate material <10 µm in size were collected at MLO, between March 15 and April 26, 2011. Air mass back trajectories and satellite imagery showed that a subset of the aerosol sampled during this period likely originated from the Asian mainland while most of the aerosol probably did not. Samples were first analyzed by automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, whereby particles were sorted into compositionally-distinct particle types. Two particle types, identified as dolomite and calcite were determined to have originated from Asia. A third type, anhydrite, also aloft in the free troposphere, was not associated with Asian dust. Individual particles were analyzed compositionally and their shapes modeled spatially using focused ion-beam (FIB) SEM and FIB tomography. Particle 3-D representations were then input to the discrete dipole approximation method to determine their optical properties for 589 nm light. Calculations revealed that the single scattering albedo (SSA) for the Asian dust particles (0.79 to 0.94) straddled the critical SSA for cooling vs. warming (0.86), with the lowest SSA (0.79) attributed to a small amount of soot (1.7 % by volume) attached to a dolomite particle. SSA for the free troposphere anhydrite particles (0.90 to 0.93) was well above the critical SSA. For the three particle types, SSA for the actual-shaped particles was higher than equivalently-sized spheres, cubes, or tetrahedra. For the fraction of backscattered light from particles, DDA results for equivalently-sized spheres, cubes, or tetrahedra were much larger, surprisingly, than for the actual-shaped particles: from 2-times larger for tetrahedra to as much as 14-times larger for spheres.",

For these compositions, we establish some link between the variation of the viscosity, the configurational entropy as the function of chemical composition and the Q species obtained from the Raman spectroscopy.

Theoretical considerations and empirical observations show that, in the magnitude range between 3 and 5, MW and ML scale 1∶1. Whilst for smaller magnitudes this 1∶1 scaling breaks down (Bethmann et al. 2011). For accomplishing this task we analyzed the source parameters of about 1500 (30.000 waveforms) well-located small earthquakes occurred in the Upper Tiber Valley (Northern Apennines) in the range of -1.5≤ML≤3.8. In between these earthquakes there are 300 events repeatedly rupturing the same fault patch generally twice within a short time interval (less than 24 hours; Chiaraluce et al., 2007). We use high-resolution short period and broadband recordings acquired between 2010 and 2014 by 50 permanent seismic stations deployed to monitor the activity of a regional low angle normal fault (named Alto Tiberina fault, ATF) in the framework of The Alto Tiberina Near Fault Observatory project (TABOO; Chiaraluce et al., 2014). For this study the direct determination of MW for small earthquakes is essential but unfortunately the computation of MW for small earthquakes (MW < 3) is not a routine procedure in seismology. We apply the contributions of source, site, and crustal attenuation computed for this area in order to obtain precise spectral corrections to be used in the calculation of small earthquakes spectral plateaus. The aim of this analysis is to achieve moment magnitudes of small events through a procedure that uses our previously calibrated crustal attenuation parameters (geometrical spreading g(r), quality factor Q(f), and the residual parameter k) to correct for path effects. We determine the MW–ML relationships in two selected fault zones (on-fault and fault-hanging-wall) of the ATF by an orthogonal regression analysis providing a semi-automatic and robust procedure for moment magnitude determination within a region characterized by small to moderate seismicity. Finally, we present for a subset of data, corner frequency values computed by spectral analysis of S-waves, using data from three nearby shallow borehole stations sampled at 500 sps.",

We obtained digital still images and microbathymetery at an altitude of 3 m from the seafloor by using stereo cameras and a BlueView system mounted on Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Hercules during the NA054 cruise on E/V Nautilus (Sept. - Oct. 2014). The seafloor images were processed to construct 2-D photo mosaics of the survey area using Standard Hercules Imaging Suite. We systematically classified the photographed seafloor geology based on the distribution of seafloor morphology and the observable rock fragment and outcrop sizes. The center of the crater floor shows a smooth, coherent texture with little variation in sea floor morphology. From immediately outside this area toward the crater rim, we observe an extensive area covered with outcrops, small rocks, and sediment: and within this area, (1) the north section is partially covered by uneven outcrops with elongated lineaments and a course, rugged seafloor with individual rock fragments observable; (2) the middle section contains high variability and heterogeneity in seafloor morphology in a non-systematic manner; and (3) overall, the southern most section displays subdued seafloor features both in space and variability compared to the other areas. The distributions of rock fragments were classified into four distinct sizes. We observe: (i) little variation in size distribution near the center of the crater floor; and (ii) rock fragment size increasing toward the rim of the crater. To obtain a better understanding of the link between variation in seafloor morphology, rock size distribution, and other in situ processes, we compare our observations on the digital photo mosaic to bathymetry data and ROV visuals (e.g. vents and bacterial mats).",

Located along the Eastern Mediterranean (Beirut), the pilot aquifer consists of karstified limestone of Cretaceous age overlain by Upper Tertiary and Quaternary unconsolidated deposits. The model used the advanced pilot-points parameterization coupled with PEST to characterize spatial heterogenieity. Historically simulated water levels were relied upon to reduce potential numerical instabilities induced by insensitive parameters in transient calibration. The latter demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity in the middle parts of the aquifer and along western coastlines with specification of a high hydraulic conductivity and low storativity in fault networks. The response of the aquifer to seasonal stresses such as climate cycles, pumping rates and recharge rates was manifested as high fluctuations in potentiometric surface due to potential fast flow pathways along faults. The final distribution of saltwater intrusion supports two mechanisms 1) lateral encroachment of recent seawater into the western zone of the aquifer which is of most concern due to high horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the wave direction and 2) upconing in the northwest and southwest of the aquifer due to large vertical hydraulic conductivities that tend to exacerbate the vertical movement of salinity.",

This study utilizes single particle mass spectrometry, along with aerosol physical and chemical measurements and meteorological measurements to show that the dramatic change in aerosol properties is strongly related to regional meteorology and anthropogenically-influenced chemical processes in California’s Central Valley.

            "abstract": "Unlike most subduction environments that exist mostly or entirely offshore, the Nicoya Peninsula’s location allows for unique land-based observations of the entire down-dip extent of coupling and failure along the seismogenic megathrust. Because of this geometry and approximately 50-year repeat cycle of mid-magnitude 7 earthquakes there, numerous geophysical studies were focused on the peninsula. Most notably of these are the dense seismic and GPS networks cooperatively operated by UC Santa Cruz, Georgia Tech, U. South Florida, and OVSICORI, collectively called the Nicoya Seismic Cycle Observatory (NSCO). The megathrust environment beneath Nicoya is additionally characterized by strong along-strike transitions in oceanic crust origin and geometries, including massive subducted seamounts, and a substantial crustal suture well documented in recent work by Kyriakopoulos et al. [JGR, 2015].\nUsing GPS data collected from campaign and continuous sites going back approximately 20 years, a number of studies have imaged components of the seismic cycle, including late-interseismic coupling, frequent slow-slip events, coseismic rupture of a moment magnitude 7.6 earthquake in 2012, and early postseismic response. The derived images of interface locking and slip behavior published for each of these episodes use different model geometries, different weighting schemes, and modeling algorithms limiting their use for fully characterizing the transitions between zones. Here, we report the first unified analysis of the full continuum of slip using the new locally defined 3D plate interface model. We focus on evaluating how transitions in plate geometry control observed locking, slip, and quantifying how well pre-seismic images of megathrust locking and slow-slip events dictate coseismic and postseismic behavior.\nWithout the long-term and continuous geodetic observations made by the NSCO, this work would not have been possible.",

            "abstract": "Using the Superparameterized Community Atmosphere Model, the authors investigate the importance of (i) the influences of extratropical and circumnavigating waves, (ii) the wind-evaporation feedback and (iii) the radiative-convective feedback to the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). A common issue with mechanism-denial studies is the interference from mean state changes in the simulations when processes are turned off in the model. In the present study, time-invariant forcing and nudging on an effective time scale longer than the intraseasonal time scale are implemented to maintain the mean state. Forced by perpetual February sea surface temperature, the control simulation is integrated for 15 years, and produces satisfactory climatology. The influence of extratropical waves on the MJO is first examined by relaxing the prognostic variables outside the tropics towards the controlled mean state. When the mean state is not maintained, the MJO activity decreases as the Hadley circulation weakens, consistent with a previous study. However, when the mean state is maintained to be the same as that of the control, the MJO activity does not decrease with the suppression of extratropical waves and remains as strong as that in the control. The results are not sensitive to the latitudes beyond which the extratropical waves are suppressed. To further assess the influence of circumnavigating waves on the MJO, the prognostic variables are relaxed towards the controlled climatology all over the globe except within 40°S-30°N, 0°E-90°W, so that the MJO initiation and propagation are confined in the box. In this experiment, strong MJO activity is produced over the tropical Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, and the results suggest that the essential processes for the existence of the MJO are internal to these regions. In the last two experiments, the wind-evaporation and radiative-convective feedback are turned off by prescribing surface flux and radiative heating to the climatology of these fields from the control simulation, respectively, and it is found that the wind-evaporation feedback slows down the MJO, while the radiative-convective feedback amplifies the MJO. The present results illustrate the importance of maintaining the mean state in MJO mechanism-denial studies.",

            "abstract": "In the Northeastern U.S., the most costly damages from intense storm events were impacts to road–stream crossings. In steep post-glacial terrain, erosion by floodwater and entrained sediment is the largest destructive force during intense storms, and the most likely driver of major morphological changes to riverbanks and channels. Steam power analysis is a tool that can successfully quantify floodwater energy that caused damage afterward, however, prediction of which reaches or watersheds may experience future impacts remains uncertain. We must better determine how states with thousands of river miles may better prioritize flood mitigation studies, crossing replacements, or other infrastructure upgrades for future flood resilience within resource constraints. This challenged us to develop a statewide–scale scientific method for screening waterways and translating the results into effective policies for river corridor management. Here we present a method based on stream power analysis using widely–available 10–m DEMs and stream flow data to identify locations with extreme high or low stream power values (i.e., >300 W⁄m2 or <60 W⁄m2) or abrupt changes in these values. We used this information to identify potential areas of erosion or deposition in the Deerfield River watershed in Massachusetts and Vermont, then compared it to areas where damage occurred during Tropical Storm Irene. We show that areas of increasing (with respect to distance downstream) and high stream power are prone to landslides, bank failures, and other pulse sediment inputs in flood events. These are also the focal points of wood input to rivers, which combined with increased sediment load, makes culverts in these reaches especially prone to failure. Integration of this information into state databases allows communities to prioritize and make land–use decisions that are informed by the fluvial geomorphic workings of the larger watershed, but that have powerful local implications. Outreach and educational programs focused on stream power and fluvial systems for river practitioners and politicians at all levels align communities’ attitudes about their rivers and result in ecologically sound, more flood resilient policies and practices.",

It was also the beginning of long-term recovery to prepare for next tsunami attack in the future. In this presentation, I would like to review the recovery process from the following five elements: quantification of tsunami hazards, public education, evacuation model, land-use planning, and real-time tsunami warning. It should be noted that there are lessons from the 2011 event at two different levels: national level and prefecture levels. In relation to the quantification of tsunami hazard and real-time tsunami warning, it followed a big change in tsunami policy at national level such as setting up two levels of tsunami scenarios for tsunami preparedness and mitigation: Level 1 tsunami (L1) and Level 2 tsunami (L2). L1 is the tsunami risk with 50 year return period, and L2 is the one with 1,000 year return period. As for public education, evacuation model, and land-use planning, There existed a big difference for what happened in the northern half of the coast and the southern half. Northern half of the coast belongs to Iwate Prefecture whose geography is rias coast. People in the Rias coast of Iwate Prefecture has been hit many times by tsunami on the average of about 50 years. With these many experiences, they succeeded in reducing the number of mortality down to 4,000 in comparison with 20,000 at the 1886 tsunami disaster. Most of the Southern half belongs to Miyagi Prefecture whose geography is coastal plain. People in the coastal plain in Miyagi Prefecture has little experience with tsunami disaster and end up with 14,000 deaths due to tsunami attack. The differences in the past tsunami experiences in these two prefectures resulted in big differences in public education, evacuation model, and land-use planning.",

            "abstract": "The shallow parts of subduction megathrust faults are typically thought to be aseismic and incapable of propagating seismic rupture. The 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, however, ruptured all the way to the trench, proving that in some locations rupture can propagate through the accretionary wedge. An improved understanding of the structural character and physical properties of accretionary wedges is therefore crucial to begin to assess why such anomalously shallow seismic rupture occurs. Despite its importance, we know surprisingly little regarding the 3D geometry and kinematics of thrust network development in accretionary prisms, largely due to a lack of 3D seismic reflection data providing high-resolution, 3D images of entire networks. Thus our current understanding is largely underpinned by observations from analogue and numerical modelling, with limited observational data from natural examples.\nIn this contribution we use PSDM, 3D seismic reflection data from the Nankai margin (3D Muroto dataset, available from the UTIG Academic Seismic Portal, Marine Geoscience Data System) to examine how imbricate thrust fault networks evolve during accretionary wedge growth. Previous studies have reported en-echelon thrust fault geometries from the NW part of the dataset, and have related this complex structure to seamount subduction. We unravel the evolution of faults within the protothrust and imbricate thrust zones by interpreting multiple horizons across faults and measuring fault displacement and fold amplitude along-strike; by doing this, we are able to investigate the three dimensional accrual of strain. We document a number of local displacement minima along-strike of faults, suggesting that, the protothrust and imbricate thrusts developed from the linkage of smaller, previously isolated fault segments. We also demonstrate that the majority of faults grew upward from the décollement, although there is some evidence for downward fault propagation. Our observations reveal that fault segmentation is not restricted to the NW and we propose that segmentation and linkage is in fact the norm for imbricate thrust zone faults. The complex fault interactions documented here have implications for hydraulic compartmentalisation and pore fluid pressure along the shallow parts of the megathrust.",

We here explore the potential role of atmospheric circulation changes around the Amundsen Sea, themselves possibly forced by tropical SSTs, an explanation that has been recently advanced.\n As a first check on this hypothesis, we compare the atmospheric circulation trends simulated by atmospheric GCMs coupled with an ocean or with imposed SSTs (AMIP experiment from CMIP5); the latter being in theory able to reproduce changes caused by natural SST variability. While coupled models simulate in aggregate trends that project on the SAM structure, strongest in summer, the AMIP simulations add in the winter season a pronounced Amundsen Sea Low signature (and a PNA signature in the northern hemisphere) both consistent with a Niña-like trend in the tropical Pacific.\nWe then use a specific coupled GCM setup, in which the surface winds over the tropical Pacific are strongly nudged towards the observed ones, including their interannual variability. The model then simulates a trend in the Amundsen-Sea Low in winter, as well as a dipole in sea-ice cover (but no global increase). Further analysis shows that the sea-ice dipole is forced by surface heat flux anomalies in early winter, then maintained by ice-albedo feedbacks.",

A total of 230 farmers, 6 traditional authorities and 5 administrators belonging to 32 villages were interviewed. Most of local people (95.1-96.7%) believe that climate change is occurring, and cited general increases in average temperatures, fluctuating rainfall regimes and extended drought periods as some of their observations. They explain the increasing changes and vulnerability of savannas ecosystems through the longer time spent and distance covered to collect medicinal plants and forest food; decreasing productivity and availability of fodder, fuel wood, forest food and medicinal plant, changing uses of forest food and medicinal plant species. The views of farmers were generally shared by the traditional authorities and administrators. Adaptation actions employed by local communities are tree planting, protection of forestry resources, migration, awareness raising, conservation of soil and water resources.",

            "abstract": "At many subduction zones, pore water geochemical anomalies at seafloor seeps and in shallow boreholes indicate upward fluid flow and chemical transport from depths of several km. Identifying the source regions and flow pathways of these fluids is a key step toward quantifying volatile fluxes through forearcs, and in understanding their potential connection to loci of excess pore pressure along the plate boundary. Here, we focus on observations of pore water freshening (reported in terms of [Cl]), elevated [B], and light δ11B. Pore water freshening is generally thought to result from clay dehydration, whereas the B and δ11B signatures are interpreted to reflect desorption of isotopically light B from pelitic sediments with increasing temperature.\nWe develop a model to track the coupled effects of B desorption, smectite dehydration, and progressive consolidation within the underthrusting sediment section. Our model incorporates established kinetic models of clay dehydration, and experimental data that define the temperature-dependent distribution coefficient (Kd) and fractionation of B in marine sediments. A generic sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the relative timing of heating and consolidation is a dominant control on pore water composition. For cold slabs, freshening is maximized because dehydration releases bound water into low porosity sediment, whereas B concentrations and isotopic signatures are modest because desorption is only partially complete. For warmer slabs, [B] and [Cl] signals are smaller, because heating and desorption occur shallower and into larger porosities, but the predicted δ11B signal is larger. The former scenario is typical of non-accretionary margins where the insulating sediment layer on the subducting plate is commonly <1 km thick. This result provides a quantitative explanation for the global observation that [Cl] depletion and [B] enrichment signals are generally strongest at non-accretionary margins. Application of our multi-tracer approach to the Costa Rica, N. Japan, N. Barbados, and Mediterranean Ridge subduction zones illustrates that clay dehydration and B desorption are viable mechanisms for the generation of observed geochemical signatures, including pore water freshening of over 50%, [B] up to 10x seawater values, and δ11B as low as 17‰.",

            "abstract": "Floods are the products of complex interactions between the highly variable spacetime structure of extreme rainfall with land surface and drainage network features at various scales. Precise description of these interactions has proven elusive, mainly due to the lack of sufficient spacetime rainfall information and relatively short and sparse observational records. Rainfall remote-sensing data archives are now reaching sufficient length to examine these interactions in greater detail. Long-standing precipitation-based flood hazard estimation practices such as design storms and Probable Maximum Precipitation rely on simplified assumptions to describe the interactions between extreme rainfall and flood response. In this study, the validity of these assumptions are explored using RainyDay, a probabilistic stochastic storm transposition framework developed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center for generating large numbers of rainfall “scenarios” using rainfall remote sensing data, each with realistic probability, intensity, and spacetime structure. RainyDay is coupled with NCEP Stage IV multisensor precipitation data and the Iowa Flood Center Model, an uncalibrated multiscale distributed hydrologic modeling platform. We study the relationship between simulated rainfall and peak discharge probability and intensity for a wide range of exceedance probabilities and for a number of nested subwatersheds of Turkey River in Northeastern Iowa, ranging in drainage area from 10 km2 to 4300 km2. The results demonstrate some interesting implications for the relationship between Probable Maximum Precipitation and the Probable Maximum Flood at a range of basin scales and highlight possible deficiencies in the standard approaches to compute these quantities. Satellite-based precipitation estimates with global coverage allow the extension of such understanding to data-poor regions.",

            "abstract": "The Mi-1 event occurs roughly at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. The ~1‰ oxygen isotope shift records a transient glaciation event with an unclear driver. A new multi-proxy record from ODP Site 744 on the southern tip of the Kerguelan Plateau is the highest latitude site recording the Mi-1 event and is likely a sensitive recorder of Antarctic Circumpolar Current changes. Core 744A-12 (~28-22.9 Ma) has several short (kyr-scale) hiatuses, but using a combination of paleomagnetic reversals, astrochronology, and stable isotope stratigraphy a robust age model has been constructed. Oxygen and carbon isotopes from both benthic foraminifera and bulk sediment (~18-kyr resolution) depict a series of changes in bottom water. Sediment sand fraction counts show two intervals of possible increased productivity. Large diatom valves (> 63 µm) increase towards the Mi-1 event in pulses paced by obliquity. Benthic foraminifera, another proxy for productivity, increase prior to the Mi-1 event. While an increase in diatoms or benthic forams could suggest higher productivity, they can also be a sign of changes within the lysocline, as benthic forams are more hearty to dissolution and diatoms are immune to carbonate dissolution. Using a foram fragmentation index, we identify substantial changes within the lysocline, however the diatom pulses are not synchronous with these changes, suggesting they are independent of lysocline changes, and are in fact robust recorders of pulsed increases in productivity. There are then two likely explanations: one, an increase in upwelling, bringing up a more CO2, nutrient-rich water mass, or two, an expansion of the Antarctic Polar Front northwards away from Antarctica, bringing its more silicate-dominated sediments. The change in oceanographic situation occurred ~40-kyr prior to the onset of Mi-1 event, suggesting that a combination of current reconfiguring and orbital nodes may explain this transient event.",

            "abstract": "Building broadband multi-parameter lithospheric models is one of the quest of earthquake seismology. Nowadays, deployment of dense arrays of broadband stations and advances in high-performance computing open new perspectives to achieve this goal by full waveform inversion (FWI) of teleseismic data. Compared to traveltime tomography, broadband images can be obtained by FWI when wavefields that are forward-scattered (i.e., transmission regime) and backward-scattered (reflection regime) by lithospheric heterogeneties to be imaged are involved in the inversion. In teleseismic setting, incident wavefields impinge the boundaries of the lithospheric target and propagate up to the surface where they are recorded by the stations, giving rise to the transmitted part of the recorded wavefield. The incident wavefield is also reflected back into the lithospheric target by the free surface acting as P- and S-waves secondary sources. The resulting wavefield is reflected by the lithospheric reflectors before being recorded by the stations, giving rise to the second-order reflection part of the recorded wavefield. While the transmitted part of the wavefield allows one to achieve a resolution close to that obtained by traveltime tomography, involving the reflected part of the wavefield in the FWI is amenable to the short-wavelength updates, hence broadaning the wavenumber spectrum of the lithospheric models toward high wavenumbers. Another benefit to involve the reflection regime in FWI is to increase the sensitivity of the FWI to the density parameter.\nIn this study, we first discuss the feasibility of the density reconstruction in addition to that of the P- and S-waves velocities by FWI of teleseismic wavefields with a realistic synthetic study representative of the western Alps. The density reconstruction implies the extraction of information given by small amplitude secondary wavefields from the data that may be drastically affected by noise and trade-off between model parameter update and inaccurate temporal source signature. To overcome this latter issue, we describe a method that makes FWI independent to source signature. This approach, originally designed for exploration geophysics applications, is adapted to earthquake seismology.",

            "abstract": "Empirical work over the past decade supports the notion that a high level of spatial thinking skill is critical to success in the geosciences. Spatial thinking incorporates a host of sub-skills such as mentally rotating an object, imagining the inside of a 3D object based on outside patterns, unfolding a landscape, and disembedding critical patterns from background noise. In this study, we focus on sense of scale, which refers to how an individual quantified space, and is thought to develop through kinesthetic experiences. Remote sensing data are increasingly being used for wide-reaching and high impact research. A sense of scale is critical to many areas of the geosciences, including understanding and interpreting remotely sensed imagery.\nIn this exploratory study, students (N=17) attending the Juneau Icefield Research Program participated in a 3-hour exercise designed to study how a field-based activity might impact their sense of scale and their conceptions of pixels in remotely sensed imagery. Prior to the activity, students had an introductory remote sensing lecture and completed the Sense of Scale inventory. Students walked and/or skied the perimeter of several pixel types, including a 1 m square (representing a WorldView sensor’s pixel), a 30 m square (a Landsat pixel) and a 500 m square (a MODIS pixel). The group took reflectance measurements using a field radiometer as they physically traced out the pixel. The exercise was repeated in two different areas, one with homogenous reflectance, and another with heterogeneous reflectance. After the exercise, students again completed the Sense of Scale instrument and a demographic survey.\nThis presentation will share the effects and efficacy of the field-based intervention to teach remote sensing concepts and to investigate potential relationships between students’ concepts of pixels and sense of scale.",

In Mohave Valley along the California-Arizona-Nevada border, exposures of the Bouse Formation are observed ~400 m above the modern river elevation, which has been interpreted as evidence of tectonic uplift following a regionally extensive marine incursion and integration of the ancestral Colorado River by capture. However, recent investigations instead favor a “top-down” process of river integration by sequential infilling of freshwater lakes that does not require subsequent tectonic uplift. Accurate interpretation of the Bouse Formation’s depositional environment is needed to test these models and ultimately, constrain the timing and mechanism of southwestern Colorado Plateau uplift.\nTo further constrain interpretations of depositional environment, we present new clumped isotope analyses with major and trace element geochemistry and scanning electron microscopy of carbonate samples from the Bouse Formation in Mohave Valley. Here the Bouse Formation contains three distinct facies: basal marl and limestone overlain by thick beds of calcareous claystone interbedded with siltstone and sandstone and locally overlain by tufa. Bulk geochemistry of all facies is consistent with a similar freshwater source yet each facies is isotopically distinct, potentially indicating a strong influence of facies-specific fractionation processes. Carbonate formation temperatures measured in tufa samples are variable, suggesting multiple generations of calcite precipitation. Formation temperatures from basal marl and claystone samples are generally consistent with near-surface lake temperatures, broadly supporting a lacustrine depositional environment and “top-down” process of ancestral Colorado River integration. More broadly, our results quantify the variability in carbonate formation temperatures with different lacustrine facies and emphasize the importance of accurate field interpretation in paleoclimatic and paleotectonic reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Associated with the common use of the quite useful triangular representation of the P, B, and T axes plunges introduced by Frohlich (1992; 2001), there is a tendency to assume that the plunge of these axes is related to the obliquity of the slip vector in a simple manner. The goal of this poster is to illustrate that this is not the case.\nThis geometrical relationship can be analyzed on the unit sphere built around the P, B, and T axes frame. This frame is fixed with respect to the fault plane and slip frame made of the slip vector, the B axis, and the normal to the plane (they are deduced from each other by a 45° rotation around B). It can then be shown that the trajectories of the vertical direction are great and small circles on that unit sphere for constant rake and dip, respectively (Célérier, 2010). This is used to draw the level curves of rake and dip in Frohlich's diagram.\nThese diagrams show that whereas dip-slip faulting is compatible with vertical P or T axes, it does not require it, but rather requires horizontal B axes. They also show that strike-slip faulting does not require vertical B axes, but P and T axes with equal plunges. This also reveals that focal mechanisms where P, B, and T axes all have moderate plunge correspond to two very different types of nodal planes: one is steeply dipping with oblique slip and the other is moderately dipping with strike-slip. Moderately dipping strike-slip faults are thus among these events.",

            "abstract": "One of the issues with legacy oceanographic data formats is that the only tool available for describing what a measurement is and how it was made is a single metadata tag known as the parameter code. The British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) has been supporting the international oceanographic community gain maximum benefit from this through a controlled vocabulary known as the BODC Parameter Usage Vocabulary (PUV). Over time this has grown to over 34,000 entries some of which have preferred labels with over 400 bytes of descriptive information detailing what was measured and how.\nA decade ago the BODC pioneered making this information available in a more useful form with the implementation of a prototype vocabulary server (NVS) that referenced each 'parameter code' as a URL. This developed into the current server (NVS V2) in which the parameter URL resolves into an RDF document based on the SKOS data model which includes a list of resource URLs mapped to the 'parameter'. For example the parameter code for a contaminant in biota, such as ‘cadmium in Mytilus edulis’, carries RDF triples leading to the entry for Mytilus edulis in the WoRMS and for cadmium in the ChEBI ontologies. By providing links into these external ontologies the information captured in a 1980s parameter code now conforms to the Linked Data paradigm of the Semantic Web, vastly increasing the descriptive information accessible to a user.\nThis presentation will describe the next steps along the road to the Semantic Web with the development of a SPARQL end point1 to expose the PUV plus the 190 other controlled vocabularies held in NVS. Whilst this is ideal for those fluent in SPARQL, most users require something a little more user-friendly and so the NVS browser2 was developed over the end point to allow less technical users to query the vocabularies and navigate the NVS ontology. This tool integrates into an editor that allows vocabulary content to be manipulated by authorised users outside BODC.\nHaving placed Linked Data tooling over a single SPARQL end point the obvious future development for this system is to support semantic interoperability outside NVS by the incorporation of federated SPARQL end points in the USA and Australia during the ODIP II project.\n1https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/sparql\n2 https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/codes_and_formats/vocabulary_search/",

            "abstract": "Farmers in Burkina Faso are among the most exposed to climate change/ climate variability, as their livelihoods are greatly linked to climate hazards. Rainfall and in some extent temperature are among the inputs farmers use to take decisions in their farming activities. A better understanding of factors that shape farmers’ perceptions of climate change and decision to adapt farming practices is needed to take appropriate measures. In the current study farmers’ perception of climate change and climate variability- specifically, changes in rainfall and temperature- were compared to historical recorded climate data. Primary data was collected through village focus-group surveys and household surveys. Nine Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted in the study areas’ villages; 450 households were also selected randomly from three locations and sampled out through a multi-stage sampling procedure. Secondary data on the historical precipitation and temperature of Burkina Faso from 1960 to 2012 was obtained from the National Meteorological Service of Burkina Faso (DGM) and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and temperature anomalies methodology have been used to assess anomalies in rainfall and temperature covering a period of 48 years, from 1964 to 2011; and Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen slope estimator to assess the significance of the trends and the Theil-Sen slope estimator is used to identify their magnitude. The analysis of farmers’ perceptions of climate change indicates that most farmers perceived a declining trend of precipitation and an increasing trend of temperature in all areas. Results from recorded climate data’s analysis, revealed contrasting evidence, while that farmers’ perception of temperature match with historical data, their perception of rainfall evolution were not always corroboted by scientific evidence.",

            "abstract": "The Early Cretaceous is a time of significant transformation with the continued break-up of Pangea, the emplacement of several LIPs, and a climatic shift from a cool greenhouse to a warm greenhouse. The timing of these major events and their relationship to seawater geochemistry (as recorded in isotope records) is critical for understanding changes in global biogeochemical cycles during this time. Within this context, recent revisions to the Cretaceous portion of the geologic timescale necessitate a reevaluation of the Cretaceous S isotope record as recorded in marine barite (Paytan et al., 2004). We present a revised Early Cretaceous S isotope record and present new δ34Sbarite data that extend the record further back in time and provide more detail during two major S isotope shifts of the Early Cretaceous. The new data maintain the major ~5‰ negative shift but raise questions on the timing and structure of this perturbation. Furthermore, recently updated estimates for global rates of marine microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) (Bowles et al., 2014) and sulfate burial during the Phanerozoic (Halevy et al., 2012) require notable revisions in the fluxes and isotopic values used to model the global S cycle. We present a revised global S cycle box model and reconstruct the evolution of the Early Cretaceous S isotope record primarily through perturbations in volcanic and hydrothermal fluxes (e.g., submarine LIPs). Changes to the weathering and pyrite burial fluxes and the global integrated fractionation factor for MSR are also used to modulate, balance, and smooth the LIP-driven perturbation. The massive evaporite burial during the Late Aptian post dates the major -5‰ shift and has little affect on the modeled S isotope composition of seawater sulfate, despite causing a major drop in sulfate concentration. The S cycle box model is coupled to a Sr cycle box model to provide additional constraints on the magnitude and timing of perturbations within the S isotope record.",

            "abstract": "Near-surface wind predictions are important for a number of applications, including transport and dispersion, wind energy forecasting, and wildfire behavior. Researchers and forecasters would benefit from a wind model that could be readily applied to complex terrain for use in these disciplines. Unfortunately, near-surface winds in complex terrain are not handled well by traditional modeling approaches. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are increasingly being applied to simulate atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows, especially in wind energy applications; however, the standard functionality provided in commercial CFD models is not suitable for ABL flows. Appropriate CFD modeling in the ABL requires modification of empirically-derived wall function parameters and boundary conditions to avoid erroneous streamwise gradients due to inconsistences between inlet profiles and specified boundary conditions. This work presents a new version of a wind model, WindNinja, developed for wildfire applications in complex terrain. The new version offers two options for flow simulations: 1) the native, fast-running mass-consistent method available in previous versions and 2) a CFD approach based on the OpenFOAM toolbox and optimized for ABL flows. The model is described and evaluations of predictions with surface wind data collected from a recent field campaign at a tall isolated mountain are presented. CFD models have typically been evaluated with data collected from relatively simple terrain (e.g., low-elevation hills such as Askervein and Bolund) compared to the highly rugged terrain found in many regions, such as the western U.S. Here we provide one of the first evaluations of a CFD model over real terrain with ruggedness approaching that of landscapes characteristic of the western U.S. and other regions prone to wildfire. A comparison of predictions from the native mass-consistent method and the new CFD method is provided.",

The polarization analysis of the three-component seismograms is utilized to distinguish between P and S waves through a sliding time window. When applying the short term average/long term average (STA/LTA) method to the polarized data, we also construct a new characteristics function that can sensitively reflect the changes of signals’ amplitude and frequency, providing a better detection for the phase arrival. Then an improved combination method of the higher order statistics and the Akaike information criteria (AIC) picker is applied to the refined signal to lock on the arrival time with a higher degree of accuracy. We test our techniques to the aftershocks of the Ms8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, where hundreds of three-component acceleration records with magnitudes of 4.0 to 6.4 are treated. In comparison to the analyst picks, the results of the proposed detection algorithms are shown to perform well and can be applied from a single instrument within a network of stations for the large seismic events in the Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS).",

            "abstract": "Since the beginning of the millennium, artificial intelligence techniques as cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) have been incorporated into land-system simulations to address the complex challenges of transitions in urban areas as open, dynamic systems. The study presents a hybrid modeling approach for modeling the two antagonistic processes of urban sprawl and urban decline at once. The simulation power of support vector machines (SVM), cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) are integrated into one modeling framework and applied to the largest agglomeration of Central Europe: the Ruhr. A modified version of SLEUTH (short for Slope, Land-use, Exclusion, Urban, Transport, and Hillshade) functions as the CA component. SLEUTH makes use of historic urban land-use data sets and growth coefficients for the purpose of modeling physical urban expansion. The machine learning algorithm of SVM is applied in order to enhance SLEUTH. Thus, the stochastic variability of the CA is reduced and information about the human and ecological forces driving the local suitability of urban sprawl is incorporated. Subsequently, the supported CA is coupled with the MAS ReHoSh (Residential Mobility and the Housing Market of Shrinking City Systems). The MAS models population patterns, housing prices, and housing demand in shrinking regions based on interactions between household and city agents. Semi-explicit urban weights are introduced as a possibility of modeling from and to the pixel simultaneously. Three scenarios of changing housing preferences reveal the urban development of the region in terms of quantity and location. They reflect the dissemination of sustainable thinking among stakeholders versus the steady dream of owning a house in sub- and exurban areas. Additionally, the outcomes are transferred into a digital petri dish reflecting a synthetic environment with perfect conditions of growth. Hence, the generic growth elements affecting the future face of post-industrial cities are revealed. Finally, the advantages and limitations of linking pixels and people by combining AI and machine learning techniques in a multi-scale geosimulation approach are to be discussed.",

Photolysis of formaldehyde is a highly-significant production pathway for HOx, a key radical family in tropospheric ozone production. For much of the year, regional formaldehyde concentrations are determined by the photochemical oxidation of virtually all VOCs. In the winter, however, a rapid decline in biogenic VOC emissions makes direct anthropogenic emissions of formaldehyde more relevant on a regional scale. Few regional measurements of formaldehyde during the winter season exist to permit study of the relative significance of primary and secondary formaldehyde. We will present analysis of the sources of formaldehyde observed in the eastern United States winter during the Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emission, and Reactivity (WINTER) 2015 campaign. The WINTER 2015 campaign provided a unique dataset of VOC precursors, oxidants, and other trace species, permitting the identification of primary and secondary formaldehyde. We will also discuss the diurnal and regional dependences of wintertime formaldehyde concentrations as well as comparisons with other recent airborne campaigns (e.g. DISCOVER-AQ).",

            "abstract": "This work studied the behavior of radar reflectivity (Ze) of Cloud Profiling Radar on board CloudSat with variation in the properties of low-level water clouds, such as the effective droplet radius (re), geometrical thickness (Dcld), and liquid water path (LWP), over the northwest Pacific and China. The changes in the distribution of maxZe (the largest Ze within a cloud layer) were examined in terms of variation in the cloud parameters such as small, mid and large categories, while maxZe had monomodal distributions regarding variation in re and Dcld, that appeared bimodal in the small category of LWP. It was confirmed that the small category of LWP contained both non-precipitating clouds in the incipient stage and raining clouds in the dissipating stage. Next, optically measured particle size was combined with LWP derived from the microwave measurement to classify the precipitation type. Applying maxZe and Dcld to the analysis of classified precipitation types corroborated the importance of Dcld for examining the occurrence of precipitation. Finally, the position of maxZe relative to the cloud top was investigated using a measure of the probability of precipitation (POP) according to variation in re in order to get better understanding of the vertical distribution of precipitation amount. The results showed that the Pacific and China had ‘bow’ and ‘funnel’ shapes, respectively. The emergence of these shapes according to the variation in re was interpreted as the enhancement of Ze due to droplet collisional growth and the attenuation of Ze by the presence of large particles. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of smaller particles (nearly10 μm in radius) reinforced the idea of rapid, efficient particle growth in the lower part of the cloud. Detailed results will be given in the presentation.",

Sequential data assimilation techniques, such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF; Evensen, 1994), estimate the instantaneous state of a dynamic system in a time-forward fashion by updating the model of a system whenever observations become available. The EnKF method uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate the covariance matrix in the Kalman filter and also tracks model parameters concurrently at a fraction of the computational cost of the Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960) and Extended Kalman Filter (Schmidt, 1966). In this investigation, we build upon Gregg and Pettijohn (2015) to test the performance of the EnKF for assimilating multiple, disparate ground deformation datasets (InSAR, GPS, leveling, and EDM) to provide model forecasts of a volcano exhibiting rapid variations in surface deformation. Specifically, the EnKF is applied to a hypothetical volcano experiencing both inflation and deflation to determine how quickly the EnKF is able to respond to changes in the magma chamber source given a particular set of surface observations. Of interest is how the EnKF responds to limitations imposed by the spatial and temporal resolution of the observations as well as data uncertainties. A series of synthetic tests is run to compare EnKF functionality with individual and multiple dataset assimilation. As the EnKF is model-independent, we test the performance of the EnKF with both time-forward viscoelastic finite element models as well as classic elastic analytical models.\n",

Here we present ASP simulations of the evolution of biomass burning aerosol from South Carolina prescribed fires in October and November of 2011. This data set contains more detailed measurements of the non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) in the smoke than the data sets previously used to develop and test ASP, allowing for a more detailed evaluation of the model’s gas- and particle-phase chemistry. We also assess the potential impact of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from glyoxal and isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) on the growth of biomass burning aerosols by incorporating the simpleGAMMA (Gas-Aerosol Model for Mechanism Analysis) model into ASP.

            "abstract": "Laser-based dynamic compression provides new opportunities to study the structures and properties of geological materials to ultrahigh pressure conditions reaching 1 terapascal and beyond. By controlling the shape and duration of the incident laser pulse, either shock or ramp (shockless) loading can be produced. Samples can be compressed for ~10s of nanoseconds on spatial scales of ~1 millimeter. Diagnostics include velocity interferometry from which the stress-density response of the material can be determined and X-ray diffraction from which lattice-level structural information is obtained. Our experiments are being carried out at a suite of facilities including the Omega Laser (U. of Rochester), Linear Coherent Light Source (LCLS), and National Ignition Facility (Livermore). Using ramp compression we have constrained pressure-density states in a variety of materials including iron, magnesium oxide, and carbon. X-ray diffraction has been used as a diagnostic to probe the B1-B2 phase transition in MgO under both ramp and shock loading to multi-megabar pressures. We have also examined this same phase transition at more modest pressures on sodium chloride at the LCLS, observing both the B1-B2 transition upon compression and its back transformation upon release. X-ray diffraction measurements have also been used to study the melting curves and high-pressure phase stability of transition metals and alloys, including compositions relevant to the cores of Earth and super-Earth planets.",

Collection 6 specifically addresses the needs of the MODIS science community by targeting the scenarios that have historically confounded snow detection and introduced errors into the snow-cover and fractional snow-cover maps even though MODIS snow-cover maps are typically 90 percent accurate or better under good observing conditions, Collection 6 uses revised algorithms to discriminate between snow and clouds, resolve uncertainties along the edges of snow-covered regions, and detect summer snow cover in mountains. Furthermore, Collection 6 applies modified and additional snow detection screens and new Quality Assessment protocols that enhance the overall accuracy of the snow maps compared with Collection 5. Collection 6 also introduces several new MODIS snow products, including a daily Climate Modelling Grid (CMG) cloud gap-filled (CGF) snow-cover map which generates cloud-free maps by using the most recent clear observations..\nThe MODIS Collection 6 sea ice extent and ice surface temperature algorithms and products are much the same as Collection 5; however, Collection 6 updates to algorithm inputs—in particular, the L1B calibrated radiances, land and water mask, and cloud mask products—have improved the sea ice outputs. The MODIS sea ice products are currently available at NSIDC, and the snow cover products are soon to follow in 2016\nNSIDC offers a variety of methods for obtaining these data. Users can download data directly from an online archive or use the NASA Reverb Search & Order Tool to perform spatial, temporal, and parameter subsetting, reformatting, and re-projection of the data.",

            "abstract": " As our knowledge of Earth’s geologic history grows, we require more robust methods of sharing immense amounts of data. Various databases across numerous disciplines have been widely utilized to offer extensive information on very specific pieces of both Earth’s history and its current state, ie. fossil record, rock composition, proteins, etc. In order to gain a deeper understanding of our planet’s past we must combine the resources present in our online communities. These databases could be a powerful force in identifying previously unseen correlations if used in tandem rather than as separate entities. Creating a unifying site that provides links to these databases will aid in our ability as a collaborative scientific community to utilize our findings on a larger scale. The Deep-Time Data Infrastructure is currently underway as part of a larger effort to accomplish this goal. DTDI works not to build a new database, but to integrate existing resources. This research is the beginning step in the DTDI program. To create this infrastructure, all current geologic and related databases had to be identified and their schema recorded. Using variables from their combined records, we are able to determine the best way to integrate them using common factors. The Deep-Time Data Infrastructure will allow geoscientists to bridge gaps in data and further our understanding of our planet’s history.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate has been detected in Mars surface sediments and aeolian deposits by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover (Stern et al., 2015). This detection is significant because fixed nitrogen is necessary for life, a requirement that drove the evolution of N-fixing metabolism in life on Earth. The question remains as to the extent to which a primitive N cycle ever developed on Mars, and whether N is currently being deposited on the martian surface at a non-negligible rate. It is also necessary to consider processes that could recycle oxidized N back into the atmosphere, and how these processes may have changed the soil inventory of N over time. The abundance of fixed nitrogen detected as NO from thermal decomposition of nitrate is consistent with both delivery of nitrate via impact generated thermal shock early in martian history and dry deposition from photochemistry of thermospheric NO, occurring in the present. Processes that could recycle N back into the atmosphere may include nitrate reduction by Fe(II) in aqueous environments on early Mars, impact decomposition, and/or UV photolysis. In order to better understand the history of nitrogen fixation on Mars, we look to cycling of N in Mars analog environments on Earth such as the Atacama Desert and the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. In particular, we examine the ratio of nitrate to perchlorate (NO3-/ClO4-) in these areas compared to those calculated from data acquired on Mars.",

The magnitude of the field-aligned potential drop is likely developed by photoelectrons themselves so as to equilibrate electron fluxes with the ion fluxes. Another statistical analysis using the thermal ion measurements by the Akebono satellite at solar maximum implies that contribution of O+ ions to the total ion flux in the polar cap is small owing to almost zero upward bulk velocity at least below ~7000 km altitude during geomagnetically quiet periods. Thus, the polar wind ion flux is dominated by H+ ions, and the H+ ion flux has been predicted to be regulated by the production rate in the topside ionosphere. The combination of these results indicates that it is the source region of H+ ions in the topside ionosphere and not the photoelectron flux that control the polar wind outflow.",

To achieve this mission, IRIS EPO combines content and research expertise of consortium membership with educational and outreach expertise of IRIS staff to create a portfolio of programs, products, and services that target a range of audiences, including grades 6–12 students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and the general public. IRIS also partners with UNAVCO and other organizations in support of EarthScope where the facilities are well-suited for sustained engagement of multiple audiences.\nExamples of research-related EPO products and services include the following resources. Tools developed in collaboration with IRIS Data Services provide public and educational access to data, and to a suite of data products. Teachers can stream seismic data from educational or research sensors into their classroom, and the Active Earth Monitor display, designed for visitor centers, universities and small museums, provides views of recent data along with animations that explain seismology concepts, and stories about recent research. Teachable Moment slide sets, created in collaboration with the University of Portland within 24 hours of major earthquakes, provide interpreted USGS tectonic maps and summaries, animations, visualizations, and other event-specific information so educators can explore newsworthy earthquakes with their students. Intro undergraduate classroom activities have been designed to introduce students to some grand challenges in seismological research, while our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program pairs students with seismology researchers throughout the Consortium and provides the opportunity for the students to present their research at a national meeting.\nEPO activities are evaluated via a combination of internal and external assessments, with an emphasis on formative evaluation and regular review by an advisory committee of community members. Results from our assessments inform the program's decision-making process, which has allowed IRIS to significantly enhance its EPO activities over time.",

The contaminated sediment discharged from the river to the ocean settles down to the seabed of the coastal area around the river mouth. Some part of the settled sediment is transported to the offshore region and the contamination of the coastal area is expected to decay gradually. Estimation of the environmental half-life of the contaminated sediment is important for the assessment of the safety of the edible fish in the Fukushima coastal area. Thus we need to calculate the sediment transport in the coastal area induced by various ocean phenomena, such as tidal current, river current, wave and wind-induced current. We have estimated the effect of several kinds of ocean phenomena on the coastal sediment transport, and found that the wind-induced current and the wave-induced suspension are the most dominant phenomena, while contributions from tidal current and the river flow is negligible.",

Although several estimations exist on the flow of sediments by large rivers from the continent to the Ocean, the role of continental sedimentary basins and fluvial environments (large rivers, megafans) acting as major sedimentary sinks is still partially understood. This assessment is additionally complicated by the human activities that contributed to modify the original rates of production, trapping and transference of sediments at continental scales. South America is an ideal place to discuss these aspects because it contains a) the longest mountain chain of the planet, the Andes; b) the longest and more extensive foreland systems, c) huge lowlands/plains, d) the largest rivers, e) the largest megafans, f) major intracratonic, continental platform and aulacogen sedimentary basins. The analysis of some of the most active sedimentary basins of the continent can help to improve our perspective on what can be preserved and how much sediment is being stored by fluvial systems.\nIn this presentation I assess the biggest source areas and the larges trapping systems at continental scale with focus on megarivers and megafans, as well us I discuss some study cases of sediment budgets in large rivers that were intensively modified by human disturbances in recent times (dams, deforestation, etc).",

Using the Twentieth Century Reanalysis project version 2 data for the period of 1922 to 2012, we present a mechanism by which the multidecadal variations in the C-E European summer temperature are governed by a quasi-geostrophic (QG) atmospheric response to the AMV related surface heat fluxes. Our results suggest that the QG response causes temperature variations over the C-E European region and it is also responsible for the variations in precipitation over the British Isles and north-western Europe on multidecadal timescales. We further investigate the relation between AMV and European summer climate in the coupled model MPI-ESM and we find that the model is able to simulate a QG response. However, the spatial location of the response differs from the reanalysis which could be due to the differences in the observed and simulated North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Therefore, further experiments are done to understand the differences in the atmospheric response between the reanalysis and the MPI-ESM through idealized SST-sensitivity experiments with the atmospheric component of MPI-ESM. The atmospheric model is forced by the observed AMV type of SST pattern to better understand the impact of SST biases in the coupled model on the response.",

Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research\nTristan da Cunha Island is one of the hot spots in the Atlantic Ocean. The discussion about its source have not reached consensus yet whether it is in shallow asthenosphere or deeper mantle, because of lack of the geophysical observations in the area. A marine magnetotelluric (MT) experiment was conducted together with seismological observations in the area in 2012–2013 by collaboration between Germany and Japan, in order to give further constraints on the physical state of the mantle beneath the area. A total of 26 seafloor stations were deployed around the Tristan da Cunha islands and available data were retrieved from 23 stations. The MT responses were estimated for those available sites. The detailed data processing will be presented by Chen et al. in this meeting. In this study, we report on the topographic effect on the observed MT responses. During the cruises for seafloor instruments deployment and recovery, detailed bathymetry data were collected around the stations by onboard multi-narrow beam echo sounding (MBES) system. We compiled the MBES data and ETOPO1 data to incorporate the local and regional topography. Then, we applied iterative topographic effect correction and one-dimensional (1-D) conductivity structure inversion. The MT responses of each station were simulated by three-dimensional (3-D) forward modeling. Preliminary results show the overall feature of the observed MT responses at some stations were qualitatively well explained by the seafloor topography included in the conductivity structure model over the 1-D mantle structure. An extreme example is the station near the Tristan da Cunha Island. The impedance phases varies ~300 degrees in shorter period range which is reconstructed by the 3-D forward modeling. Some implications on the lateral variation in the conductivity of the upper mantle will be discussed by demonstrating the residuals between the MT responses corrected for the topographic effect and the 1-D forward response.",

Perennial grasses eliminate the need for tillage and increase belowground biomass, both critical to the conservation of soil organic matter and soil carbon sequestration. The effect of C4 perennial grasses on particulate organic matter (POM) was evaluated in Illinois, where native switchgrass and a sterile hybrid of the Asian grass Miscanthus were planted at the University of Illinois Energy Farm in 2008. During 6 years after establishment of perennial crops, POM was compared with plots growing a corn-corn-soy rotation typical of the area and a 26-species restored prairie. POM concentrations increased for all crops between 67 and 79% over 6 years, with the greatest increases in prairie and miscanthus soils. POM concentrations were highest at the 0-10 cm depth, however POM accrued faster in the 10-30 cm depth. Isotopic analyses of POM material showed that after 6 years, POM carbon consisted of 22-33% C4 material under perennial monoculture crops, indicating the incorporation of newly-established plant material to the POM fraction. As POM carbon is primarily plant-derived, increases in POM reflect increases in organic matter inputs as well as the cessation of tillage. While increases in POM under annual row crops reflect the incorporation of aboveground organic matter by tillage, POM increases in untilled perennial crops mirror increases in belowground biomass and the formation large soil aggregates, structures which protect POM carbon from microbial degradation and result in longer residence times for soil carbon. Therefore untilled soils under long-term perennial crop production provide an important environment for the storage and protection of carbon.",

            "abstract": "Outputs from Global Climate Models (GCM) are increasingly used to assess the impacts of climate change on water resources, however it is often necessary to correct biases in GCM predictions relative to available observations. Bias correction should be based on over 20 years of observational data in order to reproduce long-term trends (e.g. yearly and monthly trend and less frequent extreme events). In previous studies, reanalysis data has been used instead of observation data when bias correction method is applied for outputs from GCM in the world and a data scarce area like observation data is under 20 years. Reanalysis data has biases between the observation data in local scale since it has been reproduced for global scale. However, bias correction method for reanalysis data has not been clarified for local scale. Therefore, this study aims to develop the bias correction method for re-analysis data based on observation data. Our application compared 6 hourly precipitation and monthly temperature data from an Australian site with the ERA-Interim (ERA) provided by ECMRWF reanalysis data. Initially, patterns in the 6 hourly precipitation data from the ERA were poorly predicted (r = 0.34), however, monthly precipitation and temperature were in good agreement (r: 0.79 and 0.996, respectively). Moreover, monthly precipitation events, average precipitation and standard deviation of precipitation in observation are associated with monthly precipitation in ERA (CC: 0.7011, 0.8168 and 0.7523, respectively). Therefore, we applied a bias correction method to correct the bias within ERA. Firstly, we corrected monthly precipitation and temperature and estimated monthly precipitation events, average and standard deviation of precipitation based on relationship observation and reanalysis data. Then, we corrected average and standard deviation of precipitation using them that was estimated. Finally, we corrected precipitation applying cdf method to reproduce low frequency large precipitation. As a result, it is revealed that precipitation and temperature pattern can be corrected using relationship monthly precipitation and temperature in re-analysis data and monthly precipitation events, average and standard deviation of precipitation and monthly temperature in observation.",

            "abstract": "Dipolarization fronts are often associated to reconnection jets in the magnetotail current sheet and are sites of important energy dissipation and particle energization. Since the launch on March 12th and until the 9th of July 2015, the MMS constellation has been moving from dawn to dusk in a string of pearls formation. Although particle instruments were rarely operating and only FIELDS instrument suite was often gathering data, the MMS spacecraft have detected numerous dipolarization fronts, in particular on May 15th. Since 9th of July, the MMS evolved into a tetrahedral configuration with an average inter-satellite distance of 160 km and was still able to detect dipolarization fronts in the dusk magnetotail. As the Larmor radius of thermal protons is about 500 km in this region and dipolarization fronts have a typical thickness of the order of the Larmor radius, such a separation allows us to investigate in detail the microphysics of dipolarization fronts. In this study, we focus in particular on low-frequency electromagnetic wave activity related to the fronts and discuss possible mechanisms of particle heating and acceleration both at large scales (string of pearls configuration) and at kinetic scales (tetrahedral configuration).",

            "abstract": "Sliding dynamics of Greenland ice sheet are governed by basal conditions. The characteristics of the bed – for example, whether it consists of bedrock, deformable till, or some intermediary – are therefore key to interpreting historical ice volume variations, as well as understanding present and future responses of the ice sheet to warming climate. Here we report on the thermal and sediment characteristics of the ice-bed interface along an inward running transect of western Greenland ice sheet. We employ direct measurement of basal conditions in a network of 36 boreholes drilled through the ablation zone of the ice sheet. The holes vary from 100 m deep and located 1 km from the margin, to ~850 m deep and 46 km inland. We synthesize a suite of different measurements aimed at characterizing the bed conditions, including: bed penetrometer experiments; measurement of meter scale water pressure gradients, both natural and induced; sediment sampling; probing with an instrumented drill; borehole photography; in situ dye tracing; and, temperature and tilt sensors in basal ice.\nThe emergent view of bed and near-bed conditions is as follows: (a) a temperate layer of basal ice generally grows in thickness towards the margin, although with a high degree of spatial variability due to complex flow around topography. The warm basal layer is only ~10 m thick at 46 km inland, whereas near the margin the entire ice depth of ice is temperate; (b) sediment is commonly entrained into the lowermost few meters of ice, although rarely in high concentrations or with large grain sizes; (c) the bed has a strongly heterogeneous sediment cover consisting mainly of sand and gravel. Most clay particles, and perhaps some silt particles, have been flushed; (d) the sediment is decimeters thick in places, but not meters thick. Some locations have virtually no sediment whatsoever; (e) water pressure gradients imply that Darcy flow through permeable till layer is not a primary mechanism for water transport; (f) the observed relationship between water flux and effective pressure suggests that water does not flow through canals cut into sediment; (g) the drainage system behaves as a hard bed, with pressure gradients dictated by drainage system elements (e.g., cavities, orifices, conduits) that have developed with respect to bed topography.",

Although these sites have been described in full using classical methods (e.g., Baranova and Grinenko, 1989; Baranova et al., 1970; Biske, 1970; Dorofeev, 1969; Grinenko et al., 1989; Nikitin, 2006, 2007), geochemical proxy techniques have not yet been applied. Here we report the first stable isotope analyses of fossil wood from northeastern Siberia: 512 high-resolution intra-ring analyses of carbon isotopes (IRA-δ13C) in 6 specimens of Miocene wood from the Finish Creek site, located near Cherskiy, Sakha Republic, Russia. Using our model for reconstructing the ratio of summer to winter precipitation (Ps/Pw) from IRA-δ13C (Schubert and Jahren, 2011, GCA), we quantified the seasonal precipitation in far northeastern Siberia (~69 oN) during the Miocene. Although the median value for Ps/Pw during the Miocene was similar to today (Ps/Pw = ~2), we observed much greater variability in Ps/Pw during the Miocene than today. Specifically, years with Ps/Pw < 1/2 occurred ~4 times more frequently during the Miocene than today. When taken with independent estimates of mean annual precipitation based on nearest living relatives (581 to 1206 mm; Popova et al., 2012), our Miocene values for Ps/Pw suggest at least 2.8 times greater winter precipitation during the Miocene relative to today, and at least 5.5 times greater winter precipitation than today in ~10% of years sampled (6-month winter precipitation averages ~70 mm/yr today). Our result differentiates the Siberian Arctic Miocene from the Canadian Arctic Eocene which featured wet summers in the Eocene Arctic of Canada using similar methods, highlighting spatial and temporal variability in the Arctic paleoclimate record of the middle Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite (S-NPP) is a Fourier transform spectrometer for atmospheric sounding. CrIS on S-NPP started to provide measurements in 1305 channels in its normal mode since its launch on November 2011 to December 4, 2014, and after that it was switched to the full spectral resolution (FSR) mode, in which the spectral resolutions are 0.625 cm-1 in all the MWIR (1210-1750 cm-1), SWIR (2155-2550 cm-1) and the LWIR bands (650-1095 cm-1) with a total of 2211 channels. While the NOAA operational Sensor Data Record (SDR) processing (IDPS) continues to produce the normal resolution SDRs by truncating full spectrum RDR data, NOAA STAR started to process the FSR SDRs data since December 4, 2014 to present, and the data is being delivered through NOAA STAR website (\nftp://ftp2.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/xxiong/\n). The current FSR processing algorithm was developed on basis of the CrIS Algorithm Development Library (ADL), and is the baseline of J-1 CrIS SDR algorithm.\nOne major benefit to use the FSR data is to improve the retrieval of atmospheric trace gases, such as CH4, CO and CO2 . From our previous studies to retrieve CH4 using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), it was found the uncertainty in the CH4 absorption band is up to 1-2%. So, in this study we computed the radiance using the community radiative transfer model (CRTM) and line-by-line model, with the inputs of “truth” of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles from ECMWF model (and/or RAOB sounding) and CH4 profiles from in-situ aircraft measurements, then convoluted with the response function of CrIS. The difference between the simultaed radiance and the collocated CrIS FSR data is used to exam the uncertainty in these strong absorption channels.Through the improved fitting to the transmittance in these channels, it is expected to improve the retrieval of CH4 using CrIS on S-NPP and J-1. This presentation will introduce the processing of CrIS FSR data at NOAA and our effort to improve the retrieval of CH4 using CrIS. These results can be used for other hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors.",

Accurate knowledge of methane bubble size is important to calculating atmospheric methane emissions from in-land waters. By routing bubbles past pairs of optical detectors, the sensor accurately measures bubbles sizes for bubbles between 0.01 mL and 1 mL, with slightly reduced accuracy for bubbles from 1 mL to 1.5 mL. The sensor can handle flow rates up to approximately 3 bubbles per second. Optional sensor attachments include a gas collection chamber for methane sampling and volume verification, and a detachable extension funnel to customize the quantity of intercepted bubbles. Additional features include a data-cable running from the deployed sensor to a custom surface buoy, allowing us to download data without disturbing on-going bubble measurements.\nWe have successfully deployed numerous sensors in Upper Mystic Lake at depths down to 18 m, 1 m above the sediment. The resulting data gives us bubble size distributions and the precise timing of bubbling events over a period of several months. In addition to allowing us to characterize typical bubble size distributions, this data allows us to draw important conclusions about temporal variations in bubble sizes, as well as bubble dissolution rates within the water column.",

            "abstract": "The Nahuelbuta Mountains are a coastal range of modest height (peak elevation 1.3km ASL) in Southern Chile (38 deg. S). Rain gauge observations reveal a strong orographic enhancement of rainfall over the Nahuelbuta. The interior of the mountains receives about 3.5 m annual rainfall, in contrast to nearby lowland locations that receive about 1 m. The small horizontal scale of the Nahuelbuta (~40km) indicates that orographic precipitation enhancement is potentially sensitive to the effects of aerosol loading and shallow convection.\nThe Chilean Coastal Orographic Precipitation Experiment Pilot Project (CCOPE-2015) was conducted over the Nahuelbuta during the Austral winter of 2015 (May-Aug). Field observations during CCOPE-2015 were collected to improve understanding of orographic precipitation processes over coastal mountain ranges, particularly the role of aerosols, shallow convection, and shallow “non-bright-band” rainfall. Observations collected included: (1) surface rainfall from a network of 10 data logging rain gauges, (2) vertical precipitation profiles from a pair of K-band Micro Rain Radars, (3) rain drop size distributions from an optical disdrometer, (4) aerosol number concentration and size distribution measurements from a condensation particle counter and an Ultra High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer, and (5) upstream wind and thermodynamic profiles from radiosonde launches. Mesoscale model simulations and satellite remote sensing provided additional context.\nAn overview of observations collected during CCOPE-2015 will be presented. The character of precipitation over the Nahuelbuta will be contrasted between different precipitation regimes (shallow warm rain, deep synoptically forced, and shallow convection). Additionally, the performance of satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimates over the Nahuelbuta will be assessed.",

            "abstract": "The dominant factors influencing hydroclimatic extreme events in Europe vary considerably across both time and space. Therefore, it is difficult to discern the dominant processes that govern floods and droughts in Europe. However, by focusing on large-scale physical processes that span beyond the catchment scale and on associated scale interactions, new insights can be gained on the resulting regional spatial patters.\nBy assembling and thoroughly analysing a new unique database, with over 5000 discharge gauging stations in Europe, with key physical principles in mind, a better understanding of the driving processes underlying hydroclimatic extreme events is obtained. For example, by taking into account different time scales, different regimes of the extreme hydrological patterns are identified and linked to large-scale climatic controls.\nThe improved understanding of how hydroclimatic extremes respond to their underlying controls in space and time paves the way for progress in the estimation of regimes and changes in floods and droughts.",

            "abstract": "Until cost-effective in-situ sensors are available for biological parameters, nutrients and metals, automated samplers will continue to be the primary source of reliable water quality measurements. Given limited samples bottles, however, autosamplers often obscure insights on nutrient sources and biogeochemical processes which would otherwise be captured using a continuous sampling approach. To that end, we evaluate the efficacy a novel method to measure first-flush nutrient dynamics in flashy, urban watersheds. Our approach reduces the number of samples required to capture water quality dynamics by leveraging an internet-connected sensor node, which is equipped with a suite of continuous in-situ sensors and an automated sampler. To capture both the initial baseflow as well as storm concentrations, a cloud-hosted adaptive algorithm analyzes the high-resolution sensor data along with local weather forecasts to optimize a sampling schedule. The method was tested in a highly developed urban catchment in Ann Arbor, Michigan and collected samples of nitrate, phosphorus, and suspended solids throughout several storm events. Results indicate that the watershed does not exhibit first flush dynamics, a behavior that would have been obscured when using a non-adaptive sampling approach.",

            "abstract": "Mineral surfaces provide sites for carbon stabilization in soils, protecting soil organic matter (SOM) from microbial degradation. SOM distributed across mineral surfaces is expected to be patchy and certain minerals undergo re-mineralization under dynamic soil conditions, such that soil minerals surfaces can range from fresh to thickly-coated with SOM. Our research investigates the intersection of microbiology and geochemistry, and aims to build a mechanistic understanding of plant-derived carbon (C) association with mineral surfaces and the factors that determine SOM fate in soil. Plants are the primary source of C in soil, with roots exuding low-molecular weight compounds during growth and contributing more complex litter compounds at senescence. We grew the annual grass, Avena barbata, (wild oat) in a 99 atom% 13CO2 atmosphere in soil microcosms incubated with three mineral types representing a spectrum of reactivity and surface area: quartz, kaolinite, and ferrihydrite. These minerals, isolated in mesh bags to exclude roots but not microorganisms, were extracted and analyzed for total C and 13C at multiple plant growth stages. At plant senescence, the quartz had the least mineral-bound C (0.40 mg-g-1) and ferrihydrite the most (0.78 mg-g-1). Ferrihydrite and kaolinite also accumulated more plant-derived C (3.0 and 3.1% 13C, respectively). The experiment was repeated with partially digested 13C-labled root litter to simulate litter decomposition during plant senescence. Thus, we are able evaluate contributions derived from living and dead root materials on soil minerals using FTIR and 13C-NMR. We find that mineral-associated C bears a distinct microbial signature, with soil microbes not only transforming SOM prior to mineral association, but also populating mineral surfaces over time. Our research shows that both soil mineralogy and the chemical character of plant-derived compounds are important controls of mineral protection of SOM.",

With observations from the Wind spacecraft we could observe STs near Earth over a period of 20 years. Now we also have measurements by the STEREO spacecraft, which observe at 1 AU as they separate from Earth by 22.5 degrees per year. Hence we have an unprecedented opportunity to study the STs at the far side of the Sun at 1 AU, and examine their distribution over solar cycle activity (~ 8 years). We show their properties per year at STEREO, and compare them with Wind’s results. The occurrence of STs is found to be anti-correlated with that of ICMEs (STs are frequently observed in the solar minimum while the ICMEs are fewer). We then model some flux-rope type STs by non-force free models, both analytical and numerical ones. Most of the fitting results show that the cross-section of the small flux ropes tends to be elliptical. Finally we show how their orientations are distributed at 1 AU.",

            "abstract": "Henrietta Island in De Long archipelago (East-Siberian sea) still remains poorly studied geologically but last investigations show that its volcano-sedimentary sequences can help reconstruct tectonic evolution of East Russian Arctic in Early Paleozoic stage. The deposits lying on Precambrian basements are deformed to varying degrees and intruded by mafic dykes.The study was carried out on two basaltic lava flows whose 40Ar/39Ar age is 520.6±9.5 Ma. Previously the age of these basalts was assumed Cretaceous. According to available data the underlaying sediments contain zircons with Cambrian and Ordovician ages but all boundaries between these basalts and other strata are tectonic. So we suppose the age of basalts as Middle Cambrian but more precise geochronological data are required. All magnetic measurements were performed at the Laboratory of Geodynamics and Paleomagnetism of Institute of Petroleum Geology and Geophysics (Novosibirsk). Basalt samples has relatively high magnetic susceptibility values varying from 5x10-4 to 180x10-4SI units. NRM values range is from 3 to 170 mA/m. Petromagnetic parameters including also coercive characteristics point at the good potentially preserving primary magnetization. Stepwise thermal demagnetization permits to isolate characteristic components of magnetization and calculate mean directions in two lava flows: 1. Ds=294.3°, Is=29.1°, K=81.1, α95=5.1; 2. Ds=301.0°, Is=28.3°, K=34.4, α95=7.9). The mean paleomagnetic pole has coordinates: Plat=20.9°, Plong = 42.6°, dp/dm=14.3/7.9. Paleolatitude was defined as 15.3° but the question of the hemisphere for De Long Islands is open yet. In case of south hemisphere in Middle Cambrian according to available paleomagnetic data De Long islands could be placed close to Taimyr margin of Siberia and in case of northern hemisphere they may be located near south (in present-day coordinates) margin of Siberia.\nThe work was supported by grant RFBR 14-05-31399 and Russian Research Fund 14-37-00030.",

            "abstract": "The savannah biome is a hotspot for biodiversity and wildlife conservation in Africa and recently got in the focus of research on carbon sequestration. Savannah ecosystems are under strong pressure from climate and land-use change, especially around populous areas like the Mt. Kilimanjaro region. Savannah vegetation consists of grassland with isolated trees and is therefore characterized by high spatial variation of canopy cover, aboveground biomass and root structure. The canopy structure is a major regulator for soil ecological parameters and soil-atmospheric trace gas exchange (CO2, N2O, CH4) in water limited environments. The spatial distribution of these parameters and the connection between above and belowground processes are important to understand and predict ecosystem changes and estimate its vulnerability. Our objective was to determine spatial trends and changes of soil parameters and relate their variability to the vegetation structure. We chose three trees from each of the two most dominant species (Acacia nilotica and Balanites aegyptiaca) in our research area. For each tree, we selected transects with nine sampling points of the same relative distances to the stem. At these each sampling point a soil core was taken and separated in 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depth. We measured soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage, microbial biomass C and N, Natural δ13C, soil respiration, available nutrients, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) as well as root biomass and -density, soil temperature and soil water content. Concentrations and stocks of C and N fractions, CEC and K+ decreased up to 50% outside the crown covered area. Microbial C:N ratio and CO2 efflux was about 30% higher outside the crown. This indicates N limitation and low C use efficiency in soil outside the crown area. We conclude that the spatial structure of aboveground biomass in savanna ecosystems leads to a spatial variance in nutrient limitation. Therefore, the capability of a savanna ecosystem to act as a C sink is directly and indirectly dependent on the vegetation structure.",

            "abstract": "Tomographic images of the Earth’s lowermost mantle are dominated by two equatorial and nearly antipodal regions of large-scale reductions in seismic S-wave velocities beneath the central Pacific and Africa. These Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) are much less constrained in tomographic P-wave models. This discrepancy, together with other geophysical data, led to the interpretation of LLSVPs as thermo-chemical piles, but models of purely thermal LLSVPs might also be able to explain the geophysical data.\nData from seismic arrays and high-resolution processing techniques are able to precisely determine the slowness vector of incoming seismic energy and therefore to extract velocity and directivity information from the seismic data directly.\nHere we use records of P and Pdiff from the medium aperture, short-period, vertical component Yellowknife array (YKA) located in northern Canada and S/Sdiff from stations of the Canadian POLARIS network. Using seismicity from the western Pacific rim allows good sampling of the lowermost mantle in the region of the Pacific LLSVP and the northern Pacific. The slowness information extracted from the array data using the high-resolution F-statistic allows detailed mapping of the LLSVP boundary and indicates a sharp boundary and velocity reductions of several percent. The data also indicate a second region of strongly reduced seismic velocities to the north of the Pacific LLSVP beneath the Sea of Okhotsk that does not seem to be connected to the main LLSVP, and which is not consistently resolved in S-wave tomography models.\nWe observe very strong focussing and defocussing effects along the LLSVP boundary that indicate strong and small-scale heterogeneities in the vicinity of the LLSVP boundary beyond what can be explained by LLSVP material. This detection allows further insight into the structure and dynamics of the LLSVP. Using seismic wave propagation simulations we are aiming to resolve both structure and shape of these newly detected heterogeneities.",

            "abstract": "Evergreen rain forests and savannas are the two major vegetations of tropical land ecosystems, in terms of land area, biomass, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles and rates of land use change. Mechanistically understanding ecosystem functioning on such ecosystems is still far from complete, but important for generation of future vegetation scenarios in response to global changes. Leaf photosynthetic rates is a key processes usually represented on land surface-atmosphere models, although data from tropical ecosystems is scarce, considering the high biodiversity they contain. As a shortcut, models usually recur to relationships between leaf nutrient concentration and photosynthetic rates. Such strategy is convenient, given the possibility of global datasets on leave nutrients derived from hyperspectral remote sensing data. Given the importance of Nitrogen on enzyme composition, this nutrient is usually used to infer photosynthetic capacity of leaves. Our experience, based on individual measurements on 1809 individual leaves from 428 species of trees and shrubs naturally occurring on tropical forests and savannas from South America, Africa and Australia, indicates that the relationship between leaf nitrogen and its assimilation capacity is weak. Therefore, leaf Nitrogen alone is a poor predictor of photosynthetic rates of tropical vegetation. Phosphorus concentrations from tropical soils are usually low and is often implied that this nutrient limits primary productivity of tropical vegetation. Still, phosphorus (or other nutrients) did not exerted large influence over photosynthetic capacity, although potassium influenced vegetation structure and function. Such results draw attention to the risks of applying universal nitrogen-photosynthesis relationships on biogeochemical models. Moreover, our data suggests that affiliation of plant species within phylogenetic hierarchy is an important aspect in understanding leaf trait variation. The lack of a strong single predictor of leaf photosynthesis indicates that the importance of other factors such as secondary compounds, mesophyll conductance, Rubisco activation state, etc might be more influential than anticipated.",

The key component to this system is a set of commercially available slim-hole 3-C sondes carrying 15 Hz geophones deployable in open and cased boreholes with diameters as small as 57 mm. The system is currently hosted on a 4-conductor wireline with digital information streamed to the surface recording unit. We have further incorporated these sondes into a mobile passive monitoring unit that includes a number of redundancies such as a multiple Tbyte network accessible RAID hard-drive system (NAS) and a self-designed uninterruptible power supply. The system can be remotely controlled via the internet. The system is currently deployed covering a range of depths from 2850 m to 2910 m. Ambient temperatures at this depth are approximately 110 °C with onboard tool temperatures running at 115 °C. Data is continuously streamed to the NAS for archiving, approximately 11 GBytes of data is recorded per day at the sampling period of 0.5 ms. The lack of noise at this depth allows short data snippets to be flagged with a simple amplitude threshold criteria. The greatly reduced data volume of the snippets allows for ready access via the internet to the system for ongoing quality control. Spurious events, mostly small amplitude tube waves originating at or near the surface, are readily discounted. Active seismic measurements are carried out simultaneously but these require that an appropriately accurate independent GPS based time synchronization be used. Various experiences with event detection, orientation of sondes using both explosives and seismic vibrator, potential overheating of the surface electronics, and issues related to loss of shore power provide for a detailed case study. Aquistore, managed by the Petroleum Technology Research Centre, is Canada’s first dedicated CO2 storage project, and is an integral component of SaskPower’s Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Demonstration project - the world’s first fully integrated CCS demonstration project from a coal-fired power plant.",

The remnant heat of the Taiwan orogeny has long been considered to drive the circulation of hydrothermal fluids in the Chingshui geothermal field. However, recent studies based on magnetic anomalies and helium isotopic ratios suggest that the heat might instead be derived from igneous bodies. By examining isotope data of calcite veins and scaling in geothermal wells, this study aimed to clarify the fluid origin and possible heat source accounting for the geothermal fluids in the Chingshui geothermal field.\nCarbon and oxygen isotope analyses indicate that veins from outcrops and scalings in geothermal wells have high and low d values, respectively. Data for veins in drilled cores fall in between outcrop veins and scalings values. Such an isotopic pattern could be interpreted as the mixing of two end member fluids. The clumped isotope analysis of calcite veins from the outcrops yielded precipitation temperatures of up to 232 ± 16 ℃ and a reconstructed d18O fluid value of 9.5 ‰(magmatic fluid: 6-11 ‰; metamorphic fluid: 5-28 ‰ by Taylor, 1974). The inferred d18O values of hot fluids for the vein formation are significantly different from that of meteoric water in Chingshui area (around -5.4 ‰) as well as the scaling in geothermal wells (around -7.6 ‰).\nPrevious study of magnetotelluric image demonstrated two possible fluid reservoirs at different depths (Chen et al. 2012). Our isotope data combined with these lines of evidence suggest that the scaling in geothermal wells could be derived from fluids originating from the shallower reservoir. In contrast, the veins present at outcrops could have been formed from 18O-enriched, deeply-sourced fluids related to either metamorphic dehydration or magmatic processes.",

            "abstract": "To understand the cloud evolution during tropical cyclone formation, cloud features for more than 100 named tropical cyclones over the Atlantic are examined from the tropical wave to the tropical cyclone stage using the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR). We focus on a time window from 3 days before genesis to 1 day after genesis, where the diagnoses for the pre-genesis evolution are carried out in the framework of the marsupial paradigm and the post-genesis analysis using the NHC best-tracks. The 20 dBZ echo-top height is used in combination with the near surface rain rate to identify the different types of convection: i) shallow convection; ii) mid-level convection and iii) deep convection. The frequency of occurrence for each precipitation type is calculated, and the relative contributions of different types of precipitation to the total rain rate are examined with respect to the center. Precipitation was found to increase in coverage and intensity near the wave-pouch center approaching genesis. Stratiform precipitation is prevalent from day -3 to day +1, but convective precipitation persistently increases near the inner-core. Mid-level convection occurs more frequently than deep convection from day -3 to day +1 and makes a larger contribution to the total precipitation than deep convection. It is also shown that stratiform precipitation, mid-level convection and deep convection all contribute to the substantial increase in rain-rate.",

            "abstract": "“Blue carbon”, a term used for carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal wetlands, has received increasing attention recently as a potential option for mitigating future climate change. While coastal mangrove is considered as one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems of the world, there is a need to better characterize and compare the magnitude of carbon storage among mangroves in different geographical regions. In this study, we quantified the spatial variability of soil carbon stocks in a subtropical mangrove wetland in Hong Kong, and examined the effects of land cover change on soil carbon storage. Bare mudflats contained significantly lower amount of carbon than mangroves in the top 1 m soils (94.7 vs. 130.7-163.8 Mg C ha-1), indicating the importance of vegetation in enhancing C sequestration. Moreover, we observed higher soil C storage in sites dominated by Avicennia marina than those dominated by Kandelia obovata. Conversion of natural mangroves into freshwater marshes and brackish ponds with shallow islands significantly reduced the amount of C stored in the top 30 cm soils by 24-58%, when compared to sites dominated by mangrove trees. Our findings suggest that consideration should be given to plant species and land cover type in determining the overall magnitude of carbon stocks in subtropical mangrove soils.",

            "abstract": "In high latitude ecosystems, active layer soils thaw during the growing season and are situated on top of perennially frozen soils (permafrost). Permafrost affected soil profiles currently store a globally important pool of carbon (1330-1580 PgC) due to cold temperatures constraining the decomposition of soil organic matter. With global warming, however, seasonal thaw is expected to increase in speed and extend to deeper portions of the soil profile. As permafrost soils become part of the active layer, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) previously stored in soil organic matter will be released via decomposition. In this experiment, the dynamic relationship between N mineralization, C mineralization, and C quality was investigated in moist acidic tundra soils. Soils from the active layer surface down through the permafrost (80cm) were incubated aerobically at 15°C for 225 days. Carbon dioxide fluxes were fit with a two pool exponential decay model so that the size and turnover of both the quickly decomposing C pool (Cfast) and the slowly decomposing C pool (Cslow) could be assessed. Soil extractions with 2M KCl were performed at six time points throughout the incubation so that dissolve inorganic N (DIN) and dissolved organic C (DOC) could be measured. DIN was readily extractable from deep permafrost soils throughout the incubation (0.05 mgN/g dry soil) but in active layer soils DIN was only produced after Cfast had been depleted. In contrast, active layer soils had high levels of DOC (0.65 mgC/g dry soil) throughout the incubation but in permafrost soils, DOC became depleted as Cfast reduced in size. The strong contrasts between the C and N cycling in active layer soils versus permafrost soils suggest that the deeper thaw will dramatically increase N availability in these soil profiles. Plants and soil microbes in the tundra are currently N limited so our findings imply that deepening thaw will 1) provide N necessary for increased plant growth and 2) stimulate losses of active layer soil C.",

            "abstract": "Coupled global climate models have been used to provide future climate projections as major objective tools based on physical laws that govern the dynamics and thermodynamics of the climate system. However, while climate models in general predict declines in Arctic sea ice cover (i.e., ice extent and volume) from late 20th century through the next decades in response to increase of anthropogenic forcing, the model simulated Arctic sea ice demonstrates considerable biases in both the mean and the declining trend in comparison with the observations over the satellite era (1979-present). The models also show wide inter-model spread in hindcast and projected sea ice decline, raising the question of uncertainty in model predicted polar climate.\nIn order to address the model uncertainty in the Arctic sea ice projection, we analyze the Arctic sea ice extent under the context of surface air temperature (SAT) as simulated in the historical, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 experiments by 27 CMIP5 models. These 27 models are all we could obtain from the CMIP5 archive with sufficient gird information for processing the sea ice data. Unlike many previous studies in which only limited number of models were selected based on metrics of modeled sea ice characteristics for getting projected ice with reduced uncertainty, our analysis is applied to all model simulations with no discrimination. It is found that the changes in total Arctic sea ice in various seasons from one model are closely related to the changes in global mean SAT in the corresponding model. This relationship appears very similar in all models and agrees well with that in the observational data. In particular, the ratio of the total Arctic sea ice changes in March, September and annual mean with respect to the baseline climatology (1979-2008) are seen to linearly correlate to the global mean annual SAT anomaly, suggesting unanimous projection of the sea ice extent may be possible with this relationship. Further analysis is underway to understand how the patterns of the projected sea ice changes are related to the model biases, and whether there are common characteristics in these patterns among models.",

            "abstract": "In 2013, Congress passed the Helium Stewardship Act requiring the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to undertake a national helium gas resource assessment to determine the nation’s helium resources. An important initial component necessary to complete this assessment was the development of a comprehensive database of Helium (He) concentrations from petroleum exploration wells. Because Helium is often used as the carrier gas for compositional analyses for commercial and exploratory oil and gas wells, this limits the available helium concentration data. A literature search in peer-reviewed publications, state geologic survey databases, USGS energy geochemical databases, and the Bureau of Land Management databases provided approximately 16,000 data points from wells that had measurable He concentrations in the gas composition analyses. The data from these wells includes, date of sample collection, American Petroleum Institute well number, formation name, field name, depth of sample collection, and location. The gas compositional analyses, some performed as far back as 1934, do not all have the same level of precision and accuracy, therefore the date of the analysis is critical to the assessment as it indicates the relative amount of uncertainty in the analytical results. Non-proprietary data was used to create a GIS based interactive web interface that allows users to visualize, inspect, interact, and download our most current He data. The user can click on individual locations to see the available data at that location, as well as zoom in and out on a data density map. Concentrations on the map range from .04 mol% (lowest concentration of economic value) to 12% (highest naturally occurring values). This visual interface will allow users to develop a rapid appreciation of the areas with the highest potential for high helium concentrations within oil and gas fields.",

The homogeneous samples produced by our methods lead to exceptionally even heating both spatially and temporally that produced high-quality equations of state for nickel and stishovite. The Fe and Pt mutual equations of state may be well characterized and we show recent progress in fabricating samples consisting of a layered stack of Pt/SiO2/Fe/SiO2 in which the SiO2 serves to prevent the alloying of Fe and Pt. Finally, by exploiting state-of-the art nanofabrication techniques, we explore a wider range of the potential applications of such samples including high-pressure, high-temperature diffusion, melting, and thermal conductivity. Using the TempDAC code, we investigate the ideal sizes and ratios of the sample, heating laser diameter, and x-ray spot size while quantifying the effect of x-ray misalignment.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which human activity impacted the landscape, vegetation and fauna of Madagascar remains under debate. Since the early 1920's, the prevailing hypothesis has been that the savannah grasslands that now cover 70% of Madagascar were the result of deforestation, which has also been tied to the disappearance of much of the island’s endemic megafauna. Other studies suggest that Madagascar's grasslands are largely natural and that megafaunal extinctions may be climatically induced, leading some authors to question the entire narrative of extensive alteration of the landscape by early human activity. We collected two stalagmites, M14-AB2 and M14-AB3, from Anjohibe Cave in northwestern Madagascar (15.55°S, 46.89°E, 100 masl). Age models were constructed using 8 U/Th age determinations from AB2 and 10 from AB3. The samples began to grow at ~500 CE and were active at the time of collection. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios were measured on 266 samples from AB2 and 173 samples from AB3, yielding sub-decadal temporal resolution. A rapid, more than 10 per mil increase in stalagmite carbon stable isotope ratios documents an almost complete transformation of the landscape from one with a flora dominated by C3 plants to a C4 grassland system. This transformation, well replicated in both stalagmites, occurred at approximately 890 +/- 20 CE and was complete in 100 years. Further, relatively constant oxygen isotope ratios across the carbon isotope transition demonstrate that landscape alteration was not related to changes in climate. We hypothesize that the transformation was caused primarily by expansion of the use of fire by early inhabitants of Madagascar to promote agriculture and the growth of grass as fodder for cattle. The resulting loss of forest habitat very likely increased environmental pressures on Madagascar's megafauna and accelerated their disappearance.",

            "abstract": "Ecohydrological processes in the root zone act as a dynamic interface between the atmosphere and the deeper soil layers, modulating the conditions that drive chemical weathering along the soil profile. Among these processes, soil moisture dynamics respond to intermittent rainfall pulses and to runoff and evapotranspiration losses. In addition, carbon dioxide (CO2) and its associated acidity are introduced into the soil moisture via root and microbial respiration. The coupling of soil moisture and CO2 dynamics in the root zone acts as an important controller of the critical zone development through the chemical weathering and water chemistry exported through runoff and percolation. Due to spatial and temporal variability and non-linearity, modeling these coupled root zone soil moisture and CO2 dynamics presents a number of challenges. In this talk, a lumped, macroscopic approach to modeling soil moisture, CO2 transport, and chemical weathering in the critical zone is introduced. The model considers a homogeneous soil column, therefore simplifying known spatial heterogeneities, and focuses on temporal variability resulting from non-linear processes and stochastic rainfall forcing. First, at short time-scales, the deterministic temporal evolution of soil moisture, dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, and alkalinity is analyzed using a dynamical system approach. Second, at longer inter-annual time-scales where rainfall stochasticity becomes an important driver of the system behavior, the system is analyzed probabilistically and its average behavior described using a novel macroscopic approach. This averaging of the nonlinear stochastic dynamics results in a closure problem that is addressed through a first-order approximation of non-linear fluxes, including the correlation between soil moisture and solutes. The model provides a method to assess how changes in external forcing or system properties propagate into and alter critical zone structure and function, and to isolate the main feedbacks between the system components and the role of the governing parameters.",

These data have been extremely useful but, depending on the users, not always the easiest to use. Recently, with release 33 and 34, GLAS data have been produced in an HDF5 format. The NSIDC User Services Office has found that most users find this HDF5 format to be more user friendly than the original binary format. Some of the advantages include being able to view the actual data using HDFView or any of a number of open source tools freely available for users to view and work with the data. Also with this format NSIDC DAAC has been able to provide more selective and specific services which include spatial subsetting, file stitching, and the much sought after parameter subsetting through the use of Reverb, the next generation Earth science discovery tool.\nThe final release of GLAS data in 2014 and the ongoing user questions not just about the data, but about the mission, satellite platform, and instrument have also spurred NSIDC DAAC efforts to make all of the mission documents and information available to the public in one location.

            "abstract": "Hydration-dehydration of mantle rocks affects the viscosity of the mantle wedge and plays a prominent role in subduction zone tectonics, facilitating marble cake-type instead of large-slice dynamics. An accurate structural and petrologic investigation of serpentinites from orogenic belts, supported by their long-lived structural memory, can help to recognize pressure-sensitive mineral assemblages for deciphering their P-prograde and -retrograde tectonic trajectories. The European Alps preserve large volumes of the hydrated upper part of the oceanic lithosphere that represents the main water carrier into the Alpine subduction zone. Therefore, it is important to understand what happens during subduction when these rocks reach P-T conditions proximal to those that trigger the break-down of serpentine, formed during oceanic metamorphism, to produce olivine and clinopyroxene. Rodingites associated with serpentinites are usually derived from metasomatic ocean floor processes but rodingitization can also happen in subduction environments.\nMultiscale structural and petrologic analyses of serpentinites and enclosed rodingites have been combined to define the HP mineral assemblages in the Zermatt-Saas ophiolites. They record 3 syn-metamorphic stages of ductile deformation during the Alpine cycle, following the ocean floor history that is testified by structural and metamorphic relics in both rock types. D1 and D2 developed under HP to UHP conditions and D3 under lower P conditions. Syn-D2 assemblages in serpentinites and rodingites indicate conditions of 2.5 ± 0.3 GPa and 600 ± 20°C.\nThis interdisciplinary approach shows that the dominant structural and metamorphic imprint of the Zermatt-Saas eclogitized serpentinites and rodingites developed during the Alpine subduction and that subduction-related serpentinite de-hydration occurred exclusively at Pmax conditions, during D2 deformation. In contrast, in the favourable rodingite bulk composition (Ca-rich), hydrated minerals such as vesuvianite are stable up to the estimated P-climax conditions.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake source dimension is one of the most fundamental source parameters but remains difficult to be directly constrained. Many of the key questions in earthquake physics such as earthquake self-similarity are subject to heavy debate due to lack of reliable observations of earthquake source size. Taking advantage of the recent developments of large-scale regional seismic arrays (e.g. USArray) and seismic waveform interferometry, we propose to examine earthquake source dimensions through data-mining the waveform coherency as a function of inter-station distances. Systematic analysis of deep earthquakes show that relatively small earthquakes (M~6) are highly coherent across the USArray over inter-station distances >10 wavelengths and up to 4 Hz, indicating a minimal 3D structural effect on the waveform coherency. However, the inter-station coherence of M>7 earthquakes falls off with faster decay rates for larger magnitudes. For the same earthquake, the coherence pattern depends on the orientation of station pairs that can be explained by the directivity effect. We hypothesize that these patterns are governed by a finite source effect. We verified this hypothesis by establishing the analytical solution of inter-station coherency of a 1D rupture embedded in a 2D medium. We derived a multi-variable relationship to systematically measure the earthquake source dimension based on the coherency function. Rupture dimension, determined through back-projection studies, validates our case study for deep earthquakes in the sea of Okhotsk.. The coherency pattern revealed an elongated rupture on sub-horizontal fault plane of 87 km × 26km on the sub-horizontal fault plane of the for 2008 M7.8 earthquake, while a rupture of 10 km × 60 km occurred in the sub- vertical fault plane for of the 2013 M7.3 event. Future studies will explore the interstation coherency as a function of angular separation between stations. Establishment of a 2D coherency pattern may potentially further constrain other source properties, such as aspect ratio and rupture speed that remain difficult to determine by conventional approaches.",

            "abstract": "In order to save agricultural water, the famous FAO's \"more crop per drop\" has been taken literally in many arid or semi-arid places around the world and policies that aim improving \"efficiencies\" (irrigation efficiency…) have been implemented, often leading to the promotion of water saving technologies.\nIn 1865, studying coal consumption, W.S. Jevons highlighted that improving coal use efficiency could, as a paradox, lead to higher global coal use. Many economists later extended this idea to resource saving technologies in general, showing that, due to the \"rebound effect\", the adoption of more efficient technologies, in terms of use of resources, could lead to a higher global consumption of this resource if this adoption didn't go with adjustment measures.\nRegarding these considerations, the emerging question is to which extent water saving technologies (i.e. that aim improving water related efficiencies) are appropriate to save water at large scale. Our study addresses this question through the analysis of the conversion from surface to drip irrigation in Triffa's irrigated perimeter (Morocco).\nWe aim addressing this question using the detailed analysis of two data sets. First, available data were collected for every farm within the study area from the local administrations. Second, interviews were conducted with farmers to complete the dataset and to characterize their behavior. This allowed assessing water related efficiencies at farm scale. Subsequently, models were implemented to link efficiencies with general attributes and thereby identify the main drivers of water related efficiencies in the study area. Finally, these models were used to upscale farm-scale assessment to the perimeter scale.\nOur results show that, under current conditions, moving from surface to drip irrigation leads to higher global water withdrawal. However, the aforementioned \"rebound effect\" does not allow explaining the higher pressure because of contextual specificities. Deeper analysis suggests that economic but also social and psychological issues need to be considered in this transition process. To fully achieve the expected results from moving to drip irrigation, those issues must be dealt with and the transition to drip irrigation must go hand in hand with stewardship programs and appropriate farmers capacity building.",

            "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of signal amplitudes of worldwide VLF transmitters is a powerful tool to study the lower ionospheric condition. Although, lower ionospheric perturbations prior to some of the major earthquakes have been reported for years, their occurrence and coupling mechanism between the ground and overlaying ionosphere prior to the earthquakes are not clear yet. In this paper, we carried out a statistical analysis based on the nighttime averaged signal amplitude data from the UEC’s VLF/LF transmitter observation network. Two hundred forty three earthquakes were occurred within the 5th Fresnel zone of transmitter-receiver paths around Japan during the time period of 2007 to 2012. These earthquakes were characterized into three different groups based on the Centroid-Moment-Tensor (CMT) solution such as reverse fault type, normal fault type and stress slip type. The ionospheric anomaly was identified by a large change in the VLF/LF amplitude during nighttime. As a result, we found the ionospheric perturbations associated with both ground and sea earthquakes. Remarkably, the reverse fault type earthquakes have the highest occurrence rate of ionospheric perturbation among the three types both for sea (41%) and ground events (61%). The occurrence rates for normal type fault are 35% and 56% for sea and ground earthquakes respectively and the same for stress slip type are 39% and 20% for sea and ground earthquakes respectively. In both cases the occurrence rates are smaller than the reverse fault type. The clear difference of occurrence rate of the ionospheric perturbations may indicate that the coupling efficiency of seismic activity into the overlaying ionosphere is controlled by the pressure in the earth’s crust. This gives us further physical insight of Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere (LAI) coupling processes.",

The volumetric transport of this inland flow is in part controlled by mixing processes and the entrainment of Cold Intermediate Water. The present study assesses the conditions for the LC internal mixing in the upper 200 m. Two high resolution transects were conducted across the channel, one near the LC mouth (at the shelfbreak), and another further inshore at the Cabot Strait. These transects comprised two data types, CTD measurements from a Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) that yielded a high resolution density sampling, and velocity profiles from a 75 kHz shipboard ADCP. The energetic internal mixing at the mouth was evident in frequent areas of inverse stratification. These inverses were much less numerous in the Cabot St. The gradient Richardson number (Ri) was estimated on the transects and it was found that at the mouth more than 50% of the sampled area was characterized by Ri < 0.25. Energetic interior overturnings at the mouth could be caused by the internal wave energy convergence into the channel. The ADCP measurements and the geostrophic velocity estimate revealed a rich submesoscale eddy field at the mouth in the upper layer of the water column with a vorticity shear at ~80 m depth. The observed vortical features could further enhance the internal wave breaking.",

            "abstract": "Forming the boundary between the Anatolian and Arabian plates in Turkey, the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) is a major tectonic structure in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Together with its conjugate, the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), it accommodates the westward motion of the Anatolian plate with respect to Eurasia. Although it has been associated only with small-to-moderate sized earthquakes in the instrumental period and relatively quiet compared to the North Anatolian Fault, the EAF produced devastating large (M > 7) earthquakes in the historical time (Ambraseys et al., 1998). Analysis of historical seismicity (Nalbant et al., 2001) suggests that a seismic gap exists between the Lake of Hazar and Bingöl, referred here as to Palu seismic gap (PSG) We estimate the interseismic velocity field along the BSG using the Persistent Scatterer InSAR technique (Hooper, 2008). ENVISAT ASAR data acquired between 2003 and 2010 on three adjacent descending and overlapping tracks (T035, T264 and T493) are use to map the interseismic strain accumulation. The results reveal that the 100-km-long section of the Palu segment is exhibiting aseismic creep at the surface. The creep rate varies along the fault reaching, at some places, to the far field GPS-based plate velocity (i.e., 10 ± 0.3 mm/y; Reilinger et al., 2006), implying that significant portion of the elastic strain has been released aseismically. Preliminary modelling with elastic dislocations suggests that some sections of the fault may be creeping from surface down to the entire seismogenic crust. Geology of the fault zone is dominated by ophiolitic and volcanic rocks characterized by weak phyllosilicate minerals, suggesting that aseismic slip is promoted by minerals with low frictional properties. Furthermore, to monitor the surface creep, a GPS network has been established along the Palu segment. One survey has so far been realized and we expect the reliable results in 2 years (supported by TUBITAK no: 114Y250 project).",

The full characterization of the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere coupled system necessitates measurements with higher spatial/temporal resolution and from multiple locations simultaneously. This becomes extremely challenging in the current state of shrinking budgets. Traditionally, including a science-grade magnetometer in a mission necessitates very costly integration and design (sensor on long boom) and imposes magnetic cleanliness restrictions on all components of the bus and payload. Recent advances in Smallsat and Cubesat developments offer a pathway for the proliferation of measurements. However, the Cubesat bus is a small volume in which to include all traditional bus components and payload, and the low cost of such programs makes the acquisition of clean Geomagnetic field observations a challenge. This work presents our approach of combining multiple sensitive onboard sensors with an innovative algorithm approach that enables high quality magnetic field measurements in Cubesats.",

            "abstract": "Northern Chile (NC), located along the west coast of South America between 28°S-20°S, hosts the driest place on Earth, Quillagua in the Atacama Desert (annual mean precipitation of 0.05 mm for 1969-2000 period). Nonetheless, an extreme precipitation event affected the region on 24-26 March 2015 with 1-day accumulated precipitation exceeding 40 mm in several locations and 4 mm in Quillagua, producing floods and resulting in casualties and significant damage. Two favorable conditions existed during the event: (i) a specific synoptic condition dominated by a cut-off low (COL) pressure system off the coasts of NC and (ii) positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over eastern tropical Pacific favored by the onset of El Niño pattern. The main issue of the present study is to disentangle the relative role of SST anomaly and the COL in explaining this extreme precipitation event. The event is investigated using a regional climate model and its sensitivity to SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific is tested. The ICTP-RegCM4 model is applied in a nested configuration with two domains at 60- and 10-km resolutions using different convective precipitation schemes. Boundary conditions are provided by ERA-Interim and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and different temporal SST input fields (weekly and daily) are used. Results indicate that simulations driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis and daily SST data realistically represent the precipitation distribution and associated convective systems over NC under the mixed convective scheme. The precipitation maxima appeared to be in the coastal areas and propagate inland, following the location of the COL center that allowed northerly moisture transport towards the Atacama Desert. In order to test sensitivity of precipitation to SST, the warm anomaly of SST in the eastern tropical Pacific is removed, which leads to a cooler SST forcing in the sensitivity experiment. The cooler SST simulation reproduced a very similar COL dynamics, however, suppressed the precipitation by 60-80% over NC and 100% in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert due to the decreased availability of precipitable water. The results indicate that the warm coastal SST anomaly favored by the onset of El Niño was instrumental to the extreme precipitation event by providing an anomalous source of water vapor.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in distributed physically-based snow (and hydrological) models have moved these modeling tools into the operational arena. High resolution operational products that can account for the hydrologically-relevant heterogeneities in snow accumulation and melt (ca. 100m grid scale) are now being delivered to water managers in two select river basins of the American West. This comes at a time when simpler solutions based on historic trends are struggling to cope with modern-day weather scenarios that are quite different from those previously encountered. This marks a significant advancement in modeling capabilities and provides water managers with tools robust to climate and landscape changes. However, these models have higher data requirements, tend to be more sensitive to input data errors, and remain computationally intensive compared to simpler, parametrized approaches. In operational settings, where time is limited, the number of possible model runs is necessarily constrained. Data assimilation techniques and probabilistic forecasts though require numerous model realizations to establish the sound statistical foundations they are based upon. Whereas simpler solutions (e.g. conceptual, lumped, degree-day) are compatible with these latter ensemble procedures, the physically-based solutions currently are not. Recent work has modernized and enhanced the parameterized approaches as well and these are no longer the basic tools they once were. This research looks at the advantages and limitations of the most modern operational tools in use, and the research challenges that lie ahead. Operational models developed and applied by the WSL/SLF in Switzerland and the USDA-ARS NWRC in the western U.S. will be highlighted in this presentation.",

Differences in the spatial distribution of clouds and the related impact on surface temperature and climate dynamics have been recently emphasized in quasi-equilibrium General Circulation Models (GCM). However, much less attention has been paid to the temporal variation of cloud presence and thickness. Clouds in fact shade the solar radiation during the daytime, but also acts as greenhouse gas to reduce the emission of longwave radiation to the outer space anytime of the day. Thus it is logical to expect that even small differences in timing and thickness of clouds could result in very different predictions in GCMs. In this study, these two effects of cloud dynamics are analyzed by tracking the cloud impacts on longwave and shortwave radiation in a minimalist transient thermal balance model of the land surface. The marked changes in surface temperature due to alterations in the timing of onset of clouds demonstrate that capturing temporal variation of cloud at sub-daily scale should be a priority in cloud parameterization schemes in GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Sub-glacial sediment conditions can have a major control on glacier flow yet these are difficult to measure directly. We present active source seismic reflection experiments that imaged sub-glacial sections at Jakobshavn Isbræ, West Greenland and at the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) location. At Jakobshavn Isbræ we re-processed an existing 9.8 km-long high-resolution seismic line using an iterative approach to determine seismic velocities for enhancing sub-glacial imaging. The seismic profile imaged sediments ranging in thickness between 35 and 200 meters, and the underlying bedrock. Based on the geometry of the reflections we interpret three distinct seismic facies: a basal till layer, accreted sediments and re-worked till. The basal till and accreted sediments vary in thickness from less than 5 m to nearly 100 m thick and are interpreted as the zone of most recent deposition. A reflection polarity reversal observed at a low topographic region along the ice-sediment interface suggests the presence of liquid water spanning approximately 200 m along the profile. At NEEM we acquired a 5.8 km long-offset shot gather. Seismic imaging revealed two prominent reflections at the base of the ice. The upper reflection is interpreted at the base of ice – top of till interface whereas the lower reflection is interpreted as the base of till - top of bedrock. The thickness of the subglacial sediment section at NEEM is estimated to approximately 50 m using seismic imaging. The NEEM ice core drilled through the upper part of this section and ceased drilling before reaching bedrock.",

            "abstract": "An obvious product of the scientific research process is data. Today’s geoscience research efforts can rapidly produce an unprecedented volume of multidisciplinary data that can pose management challenges for the facility charged with curating that information. How do these facilities achieve efficient data management in a high volume, heterogeneous data world? Partnerships are critical, especially for small to mid-sized data management offices, such as those dedicated to academic research communities. The idea of partnerships can encompass a wide range of collaborative relationships aimed at helping these facilities meet the evolving needs of their communities. However, one basic and often overlooked partnership in the data management process is that of the information manager and the Principal Investigator (PI) or data originator. Such relationships are critical in discerning the best possible management strategy, and in obtaining the most robust metadata necessary for reuse of multidisciplinary datasets. Partnerships established early in the data life cycle enable efficient management and dissemination of data in high volumes and heterogeneous formats.\nThe Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was created to fulfill the data management needs of PIs funded by the NSF Ocean Sciences Biological and Chemical Sections, and Division of Polar Programs. Since its inception, the Office has relied upon the close relationships it cultivates between its data managers and PIs in order to provide effective data management for a wide variety of ecological and biogeochemical oceanographic data. This presentation will highlight some of the successful partnerships BCO-DMO has made with individual and collaborative investigators, as well as those with other data managers representing specific research communities.",

            "abstract": "Land-use and its spatial pattern and dynamics strongly influence water resources and demand which are the crucial elements to be considered in water management. The core of integrated water resources management consists of coordinating water supply and demand in a given socio-economic-ecological context and guided by a set of objectives (for example: sustainability, equity, impact awareness, stakeholder involvement). Fulfilling the coordinating function requires reliable information on the water balance components today and future developments which are under the strong influence of land-use dynamics. The information needs to be gained by simulation runs based on hydrological modeling tools with high resolution input regarding land-use (and further features of the basin relevant to runoff generation and precipitation). This research combines the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and an advanced procedure for spatio-temporal land-use mapping that considers and integrates the intra annual variation within a single map and hence better represents an area with different level of urbanization and multiple crop rotations. Due to its relevant impact on the water balance special attention is paid to aspects of irrigation. The study reveals that an increasing pumping rate of groundwater for irrigation is the main reason for decreasing the groundwater contribution to streamflow and subsequently a lowering in discharge and water yield. On the other hand, annual surface runoff is increased significantly by an expansion in built up areas over the decades in the respective parts of the study area. On the UKC scale, the impact of land-use change on the water balance until 2021 is small. However, the impact on water resources is clearly visible and significant at sub-catchment level (increase: surface runoff; decrease: percolation; decrease: groundwater contribution to streamflow and increase: actual evapotranspiration), where expanding urban areas and intensification of groundwater irrigated areas were observed and assessed as the major drivers. This information enhances the understanding of land-use changes and their relevant drivers, and facilitates the introduction of best water and land-use management practices and conceiving of supportive infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "The Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 127 – 110 ka) is increasingly being investigated as a possible analogue for future climate change. Quantified estimates of LIG temperatures suggest global mean temperatures were approximately 2˚C warmer than the pre-industrial period, similar to the RCP2.6 scenario for the end of the twenty-first century. Importantly this period is associated with a global sea level between 6.6 and 9.4 m higher than present day, of which a significant component most probably derived from Antarctica. However, the contribution from the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) remains highly uncertain. To investigate the stability of the WAIS we report new results from the Patriot Hills blue ice area, located close to the modern day grounding line of the Institute Ice Stream in the Weddell Sea Embayment. A multi proxy study of the ice (including water stable isotopes and atmospheric gas concentrations) provides a unique record of changing WAIS extent over the last glacial-interglacial cycle. We present evidence for the presence of LIG ice at Patriot Hills and discuss the implications for Antarctic ice sheet stability and global sea level rise during super-interglacials.",

Although very hard considering the complexity of the solar atmosphere, this approach is becoming possible now through combination of instruments such as IRIS and Hinode, and with proper guiding from advanced numerical simulations and forward modeling. In this talk I will review recent examples of this approach, focusing on a particular, recently published, case study, that serves as a pathfinder in the search for the dominant coronal heating mechanism. In this case, resonant absorption, a long hypothesised wave-related energy conversion mechanism is spotted in action for the first time, and is characterised by a peculiar 3D motion of the plasma. With the help of 3D MHD numerical simulations and forward modeling the observational signatures of resonant absorption are characterised, matching very well the observational results. The process through which this mechanism can lead to observed significant heating in the solar corona is further identified: the resonant flow becomes turbulent following dynamic instabilities and heats the plasma. I will show how this resonance + instability process is expected in different scenarios of the solar atmosphere (the corona, prominences and spicules) and can potentially explain several observed features that remain so far unexplained.",

            "abstract": "This study presents polarimetric radar observation of evaporation and investigates the impacts of evaporation on rain rate at the surface. Assuming that raindrops are horizontally-oriented oblates, an evaporation model is constructed to examine the sensitivity of initial rain drop size distribution (DSD) to the surface polarimetric observables and the related surface rain rate. Due to the evaporation process, radar reflectivity (Z) decreases toward the surface. However, the differential reflectivity (Zdr) increases since the depletion of small raindrops enhances the mean size in DSDs, while a decrease of Zdr is also found due to temperature gradient of the atmosphere. Two cases of evaporation processes observed by a polarimetric radar and micro rain radar are shown to offer a detail insight into the evaporation process and the related DSD evolution. The first event where an initial Zdr below the melting layer is observed above 1.5 dB undergoes relatively weak evaporation and can be observed by the decrease of small raindrop concentration toward the surface, since the relatively larger mean size of the DSD leads to a slow evaporation process. In the other precipitation event with a low initial Zdr below 0.5 dB, all raindrops evaporate before reaching the surface. Subsidiary cooling effects brought up by evaporation illustrate that small raindrops are efficient cooling producer. Based on the simulation and observation results, a retrieval scheme which relates the Zdr aloft to the surface rain rate is proposed in this study to mitigate the uncertainties in rainfall retrievals during evaporation.",

            "abstract": "We study the forces acting on the Eurasian plate and the resulting present-day deformation. We use mechanically balanced models based on plate contact forces (continental collision, plate boundary friction at transform faults and subduction contacts, and slab roll-back forces), lithospheric body forces (from lateral variations in topography, density structure) and mantle convective tractions including dynamic topography. These forces drive Eurasia in the direction of absolute motion and fit observed horizontal stress directions to first order. We employ plane stress spherical finite elements and linear visco-elastic rheology to compute the lithosphere-averaged mechanical response. We consider the influence of including the major active faults in these models. Here we focus on intra-plate deformation in the Tibetan Plateau. We assume five different compositions for the upper and lower crust and one for the upper mantle, and we use geotherms and crustal thickness maps to constrain depth-dependent rheology profiles and to estimate vertically averaged viscosities.\nPredicted velocities show to be very sensitive to the reference point: Eurasia consists of cratonic regions surrounded by more recently active “mobile belts”. Using the Siberian or the East European craton as a reference gives significantly different deformation solutions. Best-matching velocities are obtained using Eurasia’s “center of deformation”, defined on the basis of force moments and located in the southeastern Siberian craton. Comparison with horizontal GPS velocities shows a good correlation in velocity directions and magnitudes in the Tibetan Plateau, Tarim Basin and Tien Shan. Strain rate and vertical axis rotation rates also provide a good fit.\nVelocity field and clockwise rotation pattern in Southeast Asia are highly dependent on the vertically averaged horizontal viscosity distribution contrast and its geometry. Faults do not significantly affect the predicted surface velocity field. Furthermore, deformation turns out to be very sensitive to the edge force distribution. In our best-fitting model, the magnitude of the India-Asia collision force is at least four times larger than any other force in the plate and indicates that the Tibetan Plateau deforms due to the largest line force in the planet (10-12 TN/m).",

These areas, known as the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), are located beneath the Pacific and Africa. This study focusses on the African LLSVP and mapping its northern and western boundaries using P- and S-waves and aims to infer the structural changes across this boundary. Tomographic models agree on the location and large-scale features of the lateral boundaries of the African LLSVP. However how to define the boundary of a LLSVP, commonly interpreted as a thermochemical pile, is still debated. Different tomographic models also disagree on the westward extent of the African LLSVP and its connection to the potential source region of the Icelandic hotspot. We analyse data from deep earthquakes in South America ( 5.5 magnitude and 100km depth) collected at broadband receivers across Africa and Europe to provide extensive coverage of the African LLSVP beneath the Atlantic ocean. The data-set provides the largest lateral coverage of the expected north-western boundary. Using Pdiff and PcP travel-time residuals we develop a model of the position of the western and north-western boundaries of the African LLSVP and detect smaller scale features located in the vicinity of the boundary. Pdiff results combined with P and PcP data allow us to constrain the height of the African LLSVP and the sharpness of the boundaries, allowing better characterisation of this dominant feature of the lowermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "The Lusi mud eruption is located in the Sidoarjo area, Indonesia and is continuously erupting hot mud since its birth in May 2006. A comprehensive combined electrical resistivity and self-potential (SP) survey was performed in the 7 km2 area inside the Lusi embankment that had been built to contain the erupted mud and to prevent flooding of the surrounding roads and settlements.\nThe goal of the geophysical survey is to map the near-surface occurrence of the Watukosek fault system, upon which LUSI resides, delineate its spatial pattern and monitor its development. We completed six lines of measurements combining resistivity measurement using Wenner configuration and SP measurements using roll-along technique. Three subparallel lines were located either to the north and to the south of the main crater. Each line was approximately W-E oriented extending for ~1.26 km.\nThe surveyed regions consist of dried mud breccia (containing clayey-silty-sandy admixture with clast up to ~ 10 cm in size). The thickness of the dry walkable mud is approximately 2-3 m and the deeper layer consist of water saturated mud that could be vulnerable to a liquefaction scenario in case of significant seismic activity in the region.\nThe resistivity data were inverted into 2-D resistivity images with a maximum exploration depth of almost 200 m. The resistivity images consistently reveal a region of about 300 m in width (between 30-90 m depth) characterized by anomalous resistivities, which are lower than the value observed in the surounding area. The position of these anomalies is also supported by the SP data, which suggests that their origin is related to fluid flow path in the subsurface. Thus the combined resistivity and SP results allow inference of an improved model of the Watukosek fault system.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic global warming is mainly driven by a continuing increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases abundances. Precise knowledge of the variable atmospheric concentrations is of utmost importance for the quantification of sinks and sources of these gases. For global observations of column-averaged dry air mole fractions of greenhouse gases, satellite-borne instruments (e.g. GOSAT or OCO-2) are used. These instruments are validated against a network of ground-based high resolution Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers. This network, called TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), provides column-averaged abundances with reference precision and accuracy. However, these instruments are expensive, logistically demanding and stationary, so TCCON is less adequate for the quantification of sinks and sources on a regional scale.\nRecently the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology developed a portable FTIR spectrometer (EM27/SUN) together with Bruker Optics, Ettlingen. In addition to filling in the spatial gaps of the existing TCCON network for better global coverage, a set of these spectrometers can be arranged for detecting localized sinks and sources of greenhouse gases on a regional level, e.g. major cities or fracking areas. Due to their long lifetime, CO2 and CH4 emissions of these sources only introduce a small enhancement to the accumulated atmospheric background abundance. Therefore, high precision and stability are a prerequisite for the measurements.\nWe present a rigorous calibration procedure for a quintuple of EM27/SUN spectrometers. Moreover, we show results from a test campaign conducted 2014 in the major city of Berlin, Germany. We demonstrate that the CO2 emissions of Berlin can be clearly identified in the observations. Measurement results are compared with a simple dispersion model. Finally, a comparison between Berlin data and data from a recent campaign in the megacity Paris is shown.",

To examine the prevalence of natural gas leaks downstream in distribution systems, we mapped methane leaks across 595, 750, and 247 road miles of three U.S. cities—Durham, NC, Cincinnati, OH, and Manhattan, NY, respectively—at different stages of pipeline replacement of cast iron and other older materials. We compare results with those for two cities we mapped previously, Boston and Washington, D.C. Overall, cities with pipeline replacement programs have considerably fewer leaks per mile than cities without such programs. Similar programs around the world should provide additional environmental, economic, and consumer safety benefits.",

            "abstract": "Rapid urbanization processes and the need of identifying urban materials demand urban planners and the remote sensing community since years. Urban planners cannot overcome the issue of up-to-date information of urban materials due to time-intensive fieldwork. Hyperspectral remote sensing can facilitate this issue by interpreting spectral signals to provide information of occurring materials. However, the complexity of urban areas and the occurrence of diverse urban materials vary due to regional and cultural aspects as well as the size of a city, which makes identification of surface materials a challenging analysis task. For the various surface material identification approaches, spectral libraries containing pure material spectra are commonly used, which are derived from field, laboratory or the hyperspectral image itself. One of the requirements for successful image analysis is that all spectrally different surface materials are represented by the library. Currently, a universal library, applicable in every urban area worldwide and taking each spectral variability into account, is and will not be existent. In this study, the issue of unknown surface material spectra and the demand of an urban site-specific spectral library is tackled by the development of a learning spectral archive tool. Starting with an incomplete library of labelled image spectra from several German cities, surface materials of pure image pixels will be identified in a hyperspectral image based on a similarity measure (e.g. SID-SAM). Additionally, unknown image spectra of urban objects are identified based on an object- and spectral-based-rule set. The detected unknown surface material spectra are entered with additional metadata, such as regional occurrence into the existing spectral library and thus, are reusable for further studies. Our approach is suitable for pure surface material detection of urban hyperspectral images that is globally applicable by taking incompleteness into account. The generically development enables the implementation of different hyperspectral sensors.",

            "abstract": "This work develops a self-parametrized Bayesian inversion to infer the spatiotemporal evolution of tsunami sources (the initial sea-surface displacement) due to megathrust earthquakes. The approach provides uncertainty estimates about the spatial and temporal evolution of rupture and does not depend on assumptions about the megathrust fault or seafloor deformation. In particular, we study the effect of spatial and temporal parametrization complexity of the source with trans-dimensional parametrizations. The inversion is based on a trans-dimensional self-parametrization of the sea surface in both space and time and accounts for model-selection ambiguity associated with the spatiotemporal discretization. The spatial displacement pattern is parametrized by Voronoi nodes that include parameters for latitude, longitude, displacement magnitude, and rupture velocity. Hence, the sea surface is parametrized by a self-adapting irregular grid which matches the local resolving power of the data and provides parsimonious solutions for complex source characteristics. Rupture onset is causally constrained by solving the Eikonal equation on the rupture velocity field. The source-time function of the rupture at each subfault is parametrized as a parsimonious triangle sequence, such that scaling parameters for triangles are only included when required by the data. Regularization is not required, rather Bayesian sampling is applied to quantify the posterior probability for the spatiotemporal model. Predictions are based on Greens-function libraries computed by the tsunami propagation model JAGURS for cases that include linear dispersion effects. The method is examined with both simulated and observed tsunami-waveform data recorded on high-quality sensors (ocean-bottom pressure sensors, GPS gauges, and DART buoys). The observed waveforms are from the great 2011 Tohoku (Japan) earthquake and appear sensitive to rupture velocity but resolution of the source-time function is limited.",

            "abstract": "The Pahrump Hills region of Gale crater is a ~12 m thick section of sedimentary rock in the Murray formation, interpreted as the basal geological unit of Mount Sharp. The Mars Science Laboratory, Curiosity, arrived at the Pahrump Hills in September 2014 and performed a detailed six-month investigation of the sedimentary structures, geochemistry, and mineralogy of the area. During the campaign, Curiosity drilled and delivered three mudstone samples (targets Confidence Hills, Mojave 2, and Telegraph Peak) to its internal instruments, including the CheMin XRD/XRF. Results from CheMin show that these samples have variable amounts of plagioclase, pyroxene, iron oxides, jarosite, phyllosilicates, cristobalite, and X-ray amorphous material. The presence of jarosite in all samples indicates these rocks were affected by acid-sulfate alteration, and the mineralogical and geochemical trends observed through the section may give more insight into this process. Geochemical data measured by APXS show enrichment in Si and depletion in Mg moving up section. CheMin data show that cristobalite is more abundant up section, whereas pyroxene and phyllosilicates are more abundant at the bottom of the section. Based on mineralogical and geochemical trends and diagenetic features observed in the Pahrump Hills, we hypothesize that the sediments were altered in-situ by acid-sulfate fluids moving down from the top of the section to leach mobile elements, dissolve the minerals most susceptible to acidic alteration, and precipitate secondary silica at the top of the section. Alternative interpretations of the observed mineralogical and geochemical data are possible, including the hypothesis that the redox conditions of the body of water in which the sediments were deposited changed over time.",

            "abstract": "The influence of water on the rheological properties of enstatite, the second principal constituent of the upper mantle, was investi­gated by performing high-temperature creep experiments under both hydrous and anhydrous conditions. Samples were fabricated from fine powered Bamble enstatite (Mg0.85Fe0.15SiO3) from Norway. Deformation experiments were carried out using a gas-medium apparatus at a confining pressure of 300 MPa and temperatures between 1123 and 1473 K. For experiments conducted under hydrous conditions, samples were encapsulated with a talc sleeve, which supplied water by the dehydration near 1075 K. Under our experimental conditions, deformation was dominated by diffusion creep as indicated by a stress exponent of ~1 for both anhydrous and hydrous conditions. Furthermore, our data yields activation energies of ~200 and ~400 kJ/mol for hydrous and anhydrous conditions, respectively. These values are smaller than those reported for enstatite deformed in the dislocation creep regime (820 kJ/mol, Mackwell, 1992; 600 kJ/mol, Lawlis, 1997). Importantly, our results demonstrate a strong influence of water on the diffusion creep of enstatite. Samples deformed under hydrous conditions crept ~1.5 order of magnitude faster than those deformed under anhydrous conditions at similar differential stresses and temperatures. This water-weakening effect is more than ten times greater than determined for olivine. Such results provide critical constraints needed for understanding the rheological behavior of Earth’s interior.",

However in such averaging schemes (e.g., Voigt-Reuss-Hill), it is difficult to take into account all of the mineralogical and chemical complexities; we therefore undertook elasticity study of a natural mantle rock sample at high pressures and temperatures. In this study, a series of polycrystalline aggregates of peridotite KLB-1 (from Kilbourne Hole, New Mexico) were hot-pressed at pressures of 3-15 GPa and temperatures of 1200-1400°C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Electron Microprobe Analysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the texture, grain size, and composition of these well-sintered specimens. For the first time in history, the P and S wave velocities of a pyrolitic multiphase aggregate were directly measured at mantle transition zone pressures and temperatures using ultrasonic interferometry. Based on the phase fractions from EPMA and the P and S wave velocities from in situ measurement at high pressure and high temperature, the velocities of the KLB-1 peridotite along 1200-1400 oC adiabatic mantle geotherms were obtained and compare well with the seismic models of western North America, the region where these peridotite KLB-1 samples were collected. The comparison with regional seismic models of western North America (e.g., GCA and TNA/TNA2) as well as global seismic models (PREM and AK135) place unprecedented constraints on the composition, temperature and density profiles for the upper mantle in this region, which can help us understand the nature of thermal and tectonic processes of the Rio Grande Rift.",

            "abstract": "Cool science is an art contest where K12 students create placards (7” x 22”) to educate the public about climate change. Students are prompted to create their artwork in response to questions such as: What is the evidence for climate change? How does climate change impact your local community? What can you do to reduce the impacts of climate change? In each of three years, 500-600 student entrees have been submitted from more than 12 school districts across Massachusetts. A panel of judges including scientists, artists, rapid transit representatives, and educators chooses elementary, middle, and high school winners. Winners (6), runners-up (6), and honorable mentions (12) and their families and teachers are invited to an annual Cool Science Award Ceremony to be recognized and view winning artwork. All winning artwork is posted on the Cool Science website.\nThe winning artwork (2 per grade band) is converted into placards (11” x 28”) and posters (2.5’ x 12’) that are placed on the inside (placards) and outside (posters) of buses. Posters are displayed for one month. So far, Cool Science was implemented in Lowell, MA where over 5000 public viewers see the posters daily on the sides of Lowell Rapid Transit Authority (LRTA) buses, making approximately 1,000,000 impressions per year.\nCool Science acts to increase climate literacy in children as well as the public, and as such promotes intergenerational learning. Using art in conjunction with science learning about climate change appears to be effective at engaging not just traditionally high achieving science students, but also those interested in the creative arts. Hearing winners’ stories about how they created their artwork and what this contest meant to them supports the idea that Cool Science attracts a wide diversity of students. Parents discuss climate change with their children. Multiple press releases announcing the winners further promotes the awareness of climate change throughout school districts and their communities. Pre- and post-surveys of LRTA riders suggests that public viewers of winning artwork increase their awareness that climate change is happening, that climate change is human caused, and that they want to learn more. Using student voices (artwork) appears to be an effective way to communicate climate change issues to public audiences.",

            "abstract": "InSAR-based studies of the seismic cycle have focused primarily on the interferometric phase observations, which place constraints on the amount of uplift or subsidence of the ground surface. Recently, coseismic InSAR coherence has also been used to rapidly identify urban damage, surface ruptures, cracking, and soil liquefaction. Here we demonstrate that time-variable correlation and amplitude data contain additional information about surficial processes and material properties that may affect ground deformation and seismic hazard. In the use of correlation for hazard response, distinguishing the coseismic signal from other changes in surface properties associated with variations in soil moisture content, vegetation and snow cover, and wind is critical. Building SAR-based catalogues of ground properties will therefore improve the reliability of rapid response and aid in the designing of future SAR missions to better map surface ruptures, off-fault deformation, and coseismic damage.\nIn this project, we characterize the seasonal variations in the soil moisture content in the Northern Chilean Coastal Cordillera and Southern California. The extreme climate of the Atacama Desert characterized by hyperaridity and coastal fog during the non-summer months creates an ideal landscape for exploring surface properties. We produce interferograms using L-band ALOS data (λ = 23.6 cm) that span 46 days to three years and have perpendicular baselines less than 1500 m. We observe a strong seasonal dependence on correlation that extends to the maximum elevation of the fog penetration. Interferograms with only austral summer acquisitions are more correlated than interferograms with one or both acquisitions in the autumn, winter or spring, even when the summer interferograms span multiple years. We propose that the seasonal dependence is due to small changes in the radar path length caused by variable soil moisture content in the very shallow subsurface. We further consider local variations in correlation surrounding aeolian dunes, quebradas or ravines, cities, and salars. We extend our work to include the Owens Valley and Death Valley in California.",

            "abstract": "The latest measurements of the librations of Enceladus suggest that it could have a global subsurface ocean or a non-hydrostatic core (Thomas et al. 2014). Further observations should constrain the properties of the ice shell, and similar insights are expected from future investigation of Europa and Ganymede.\nDetailed models of the librations and tides are therefore required to properly interpret these measurements in terms of interior structure. Here we compare the `classical', separate tide and libration models (where spherical symmetry is assumed to compute the tides, Van Hoolst et al. 2013) with our combined tide+libration model (Trinh et al. 2013), both extended to account for non-hydrostatic structure.\nEven with a global ocean, different mechanisms act to prevent Enceladus's shell from moving independently from the rest. Among those, pressure coupling across the flattened boundaries of the ocean requires special care if the shape is not fully relaxed. We discuss how it should be modelled in the classical approach to be consistent with the combined model.",

            "abstract": "This contribution reports the spectral characterization of a 30-m long lateritic regolith profile over khondalite near Koraput, Eastern India. The area forms a part of the Archaean Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, comprising high grade metamorphic rocks such as khondalites, charnockites, migmatites and granite gneisses. The area has been deeply weathered under tropical conditions leading to the development of thick laterite horizon. Samples were collected from the lateritic profile at intervals of 1-2 m. Fresh or slightly altered khondalite are exposed at the bottom and grade into laterite upwards. Reflectance spectra were collected using FieldSpec3 spectroradiometer in the VNIR-SWIR region. An Al-OH absorption feature at 2208 nm occurs throughout the profile. A blue shift of this feature related to the progressive leaching of Al and enrichment of Fe is observed in the top 5 m of the profile. An absorption feature at 2165 nm occurs throughout revealing a mixture of kaolinite, illite and smectite. Several Fe absorption features, possibly because of crystal field splitting, are observed at shorter wavelengths, particularly, 482-495 nm and 675-685 nm. Another Fe absorption feature due to intervalence charge transfer is observed around 416-428 nm. Absorption features at 2250 nm and 2263 nm suggest the presence of jarosite in the top 5 m of the profile. An absorption feature at 936 nm is observed in the top 12 m of the profile, which indicates progressive Fe enrichment. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy in the TIR – MIR region support the above interpretations of the VNIR-SWIR spectra. Goethite shows distinct absorption features at 3000 nm and 6800-7000 nm. An absorption feature at 13000 nm reveals the presence of kaolinite and 15600 nm absorption feature confirms jarosite. Further, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) helped in identification and quantification of major mineral phases present in each sample. XRD results showed gradual decrease in kaolinitic content and successive increase in goethite content from bottom to the top of the laterite profile, an observation that is consistent with the spectral features. The implications of the mineralogical and geochemical variations along the profile for the process of regolith formation in the area are discussed.",

Our investigation area represents the second largest watershed of Tahiti called Punaruu. The largest industrial zone of Tahiti occupies the minor low valley of this catchment and is particularly impacted by dredging of the stream and rock removals since several decades whereas the major high part is naturally well preserved. This study aims to identify the main infiltration areas of the aquifers of this industrial zone as well as the areas at low elevations to be protected from potential pollutions. During the period between May 2013 and July 2015, we have collected rainwater samples from five rain gauges located at elevations ranging from 0 to 1420 m. We have also performed water sampling from the main rivers and three springs up to altitudes of 800 m as well as six pumping boreholes in the industrial zone. Chemical (major elements) and stable isotopic (δ18O and δ2H) analyses have been done from all these water samples and help us to constrain a conceptual model of groundwater circulation within such a complex discontinuous volcanic structure.",

            "abstract": "The analytical expression for the Jacobian is a key component to achieve fast and robust convergence of the nonlinear Newton-Raphson iterative solver. Accomplishing this task in practice often requires a significant algebraic effort. Therefore it is quite common to use a cheap alternative instead, for example by approximating the Jacobian with a finite difference estimation. Despite its simplicity it is a relatively fragile and unreliable technique that is sensitive to the scaling of the residual and unknowns, as well as to the perturbation parameter selection. Unfortunately no universal rule can be applied to provide both a robust scaling and a perturbation. The approach we use here is to derive the analytical Jacobian for the coupled set of momentum, mass, and energy conservation equations together with the elasto-visco-plastic rheology and a marker in cell/staggered finite difference method.\nThe software project LaMEM (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model) is primarily developed for the thermo-mechanically coupled modeling of the 3D lithospheric deformation. The code is based on a staggered grid finite difference discretization in space, and uses customized scalable solvers form PETSc library to efficiently run on the massively parallel machines (such as IBM Blue Gene/Q).\nCurrently LaMEM relies on the Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) nonlinear solver, which approximates the Jacobian-vector product using a simple finite difference formula. This approach never requires an assembled Jacobian matrix and uses only the residual computation routine. We use an approximate Jacobian (Picard) matrix to precondition the Krylov solver with the Galerkin geometric multigrid. Because of the inherent problems of the finite difference Jacobian estimation, this approach doesn't always result in stable convergence. In this work we present and discuss a matrix-free technique in which the Jacobian-vector product is replaced by analytically-derived expressions and compare results with those obtained with a finite difference approximation of the Jacobian.\nThis project is funded by ERC Starting Grant 258830 and computer facilities were provided by Jülich supercomputer center (Germany).",

            "abstract": "Forest ecosystems in the Southeastern US have high rates of productivity but are underutilized as a medium for the mitigation of atmospheric CO2. In the lower Atlantic coastal plain, three pine species (longleaf [Pinus palustris], loblolly [P. taeda] and pond [P. serotina]) are the dominant overstory trees in a variety of wetland and upland ecosystems. These forest types can exist in close proximity throughout coastal plain landscapes, but exhibit contrasting patterns of productivity, pyrogenic C emissions, and mortality, thereby creating contrasting patterns of C assimilation and long-term C storage. Here, we combine field-based estimates of forest C storage and pyrogenic C emissions with LiDAR-based estimates of forest canopy heights in three contrasting forest ecosystems to 1) model their respective patterns of forest growth, mortality, and decomposition, 2) estimate the contribution of pyrogenic C fluxes to the ecosystem C budget, 3) estimate their potential upper bounds of forest C storage, and 4) model the impacts of current forest management practices and disturbance regimes on long-term forest C storage. Our results suggest that even though longleaf pine forests store comparatively little C in soil or belowground biomass, these forests nevertheless have the highest capacity for long-term C storage, in part due to their longevity. By contrast, while pond pine ecosystems have the highest capacity for long-term belowground C storage, they also have the lowest capacity for long-term aboveground C storage, one that is rarely achieved due to infrequent, high-severity disturbance regimes. Loblolly pine forests, while capable of higher growth rates than either longleaf or pond pine when in early stages of succesion, lack the long-term C storage capabilities of longleaf pine due to earlier senescence. Pyrogenic C emissions in these ecosystems are dominated by the combustion of ground and duff materials and occur over timescales ranging from rapid combustion in fire-maintained longleaf pine forests to smoldering events that can last for weeks in pond pine Pocosins. However, timber harvesting remains the dominant driver of C storage throughout the landscape, with very few forests realizing their full potential for long-term C storage.",

The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) comprises over 35, HF (8-12 MHz) over-the-horizon radars used to study ionosphere dynamics and HF propagation. It is well known that SuperDARN radars experience a loss of backscatter during geomagnetic storm events, yet details of the reasons why this occurs are not clear. Loss of HF backscatter during geomagnetic storms is often attributed to D region absorption. However, the data shows that during intense geomagnetic storms, SuperDARN radars return high signal/noise ratio, backscatter from ranges out to ~800 km, inconsistent with loss due to absorption in the D region. Examples of SuperDARN backscatter during large storms will be presented and discussed together with HF ray-tracing, ionosonde and riometer data. Data from Kodiak in the north and Bruny Island in the south hemisphere are compared. These reveal properties of the ionosphere as the storm progresses and show hemisphere similarities and differences. Possible backscatter loss mechanisms will be discussed, given the evidence derived from the experimental data.",

To achieve this goal, an ad hoc measurements campaign is on-going with ground-based instruments located in the footprints of the Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly and of the Equatorial Ionospheric Trough in Vietnam and Indonesia.\nThe campaign started on the 1st of March 2015, timing to monitor the Saint Patrick storm effects on the ionosphere by means of ionosondes, double frequency hardware and software defined radio GNSS receivers, ground based and spaceborne magnetometers and Langmuir probe. Such multi-instrumental and multi-parametric observations of the region enables an in-depth investigation of the ionospheric response to the largest geomagnetic storm of the current solar cycle. The observations record positive and negative ionospheric storms, sporadic E layer and spread F conditions, scintillations enhancement and inhibition, TEC gradients. The ancillary information on the local magnetic field allows to highlight the variety of ionospheric perturbations happened during the main and the long recovery phase of the storm.\nThe paper presents the outcomes of the investigation evidencing the peculiarities of a region not yet extensively reported in the open literature.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic aromatic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and substituted benzenes often become more toxic following atmospheric oxidation. Photolysis of these pollutants in ice can be much faster than that in aqueous solution, which might lead to higher carcinogenic loadings in snow-covered regions. In this work we investigate two things. First, we investigate whether toluene, which has been detected at very elevated concentrations near hydraulic fracturing operations, can undergo photolysis at ice surfaces. Toluene in aqueous solution does not absorb sunlight, so photolysis has not been considered a potential atmospheric fate. However, benzene was recently demonstrated to undergo a significant red shift in its absorbance at ice surfaces, leading to photolysis under environmentally-relevant conditions. Here we show that toluene also undergoes photolysis at ice surfaces. In a second set of experiments, we have investigated the effects of organic matter on the photolysis kinetics ofPAHs in ice and at ice surfaces. We found that very small loadings of hydrophobic organics such as octanol can significantly suppress PAH photolysis kinetics in ice, but that the primary effect of the more soluble fulvic acid is competitive photon absorption. Our results show that photochemistry of anthropogenic pollutants can follow very different mechanisms and kinetics in ice than in aqueous solution, and that the photochemical fate of these pollutants depends strongly on the composition of the snow. These results have implications for pollutant fate and human health in a wide range of snow-covered environments including remote areas, cities, and regions near gas and oil extraction operations.",

            "abstract": "Brazilian hydroelectric plants (HP) generate ~85% of the total electricity in the country (138 GW). More than half of the number largest reservoirs are located in the Southeast/Midwest region, where ~50% of the population (~100 million) lives. The 2014 drought raised several questions about the resilience of the water sources when several urban centers, including Brazilian’s largest metropolis (São Paulo, 20 million people), had their water supply threatened. Such drought also affected reservoirs of hydroelectric plants. This study assesses how the storage and, thus the electricity generation, in 14 of the largest reservoirs were affected by drought events within the past 20 years. We computed the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to identify rainfall anomalies throughout the analyzed period. To evaluate the impacts on surface water, we assessed the changes in total (surface+ subsurface) runoff and soil moisture from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and in Total Water Storage (TWS) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data. We evaluated the anomalies and significance of the changes in reservoir storage (RS) and electricity generation. The results show that severe dry years (-1.5 < SPI <-2.0) reduce reservoir storage (RS) by up to ~60% of its total capacity. Both electricity generation and reservoir storage showed strong negative trends between 2011 and 2014. Our results also indicate that within the past 20 years, two major depletions in reservoir storage occurred: 2001 and 2014. However, due to lower soil moisture in 2013 compared to that in 2000, distinct impacts were observed on the reservoirs with much stronger impacts on reservoir storage in 2014 relative to those in 2001. No meaningful changes in runoff were shown by GLDAS during the 2014 drought. The observed depletion in the RS in 2014 was similar to that in the TWS, as shown by GRACE data. In 2014, the electricity production by the HP declined by ~20%. As a result, the electricity generated by such source decreased to ~70% of the total production, compared to 82% and 93% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. This analysis highlights the vulnerability of surface water resources and electricity generation to extreme droughts and underscores the need to develop coping mechanisms to enhance drought resilience in the future.",

            "abstract": "The Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT, 38-28 Ma) was a period of global cooling and increased nutrient delivery to the ocean. It is associated with the onset of permanent ice sheet on Antarctica, and the beginning of a highly productive polar ecosystem, dominated by diatoms and favoring short, efficient food chains. In a highly efficient, large phytoplankton-dominated ecosystem, we would expect to see higher abundances of consumers, as fewer trophic steps means more carbon available to upper trophic level groups. Here we use the accumulation rate of ichthyoliths (fish teeth and dermal scales) to measure the relative export production of fish through this time period of changing climate. Records from the South Atlantic gyre (DSDP Site 522) the South Pacific Gyre (DSDP Site 596) and the Southern Ocean (DSDP Site 689) show a 50% reduction in ichthyolith accumulation rate in the vicinity the Eocene Oligocene boundary. However, this drop in fish production occurs just after the E/O in the Atlantic, 4 million years before the E/O in the Pacific and 6 million years prior to the E/O in the Southern Ocean. Since the EOT is generally associated with an increase in productivity and diatom blooms in the Southern Ocean and tropical Pacific, we would expect that the abundance of fish would increase across the transition. Our results are surprisingly the inverse of this expectation, and suggest that the transition from greenhouse to icehouse did not produce increase in forage fish or even a response of any kind during the climatological transition into the icehouse world. Indeed, it seems that ichthyolith accumulation rate and primary productivity are not perfectly linked, and it may be that ichthyolith accumulation is responding more to another factor, such as ocean temperature or prey availability that is not linked to the increased diatom production during the EOT.",

            "abstract": "The flow of the Victoria Nile, and the productivity of the dams along it, is determined by the level of Lake Victoria, which is primarily dictated by the rainfall and temperature variability over the Lake Victoria Basin. Notwithstanding the indisputable decline of water resources over the lake basin during the Long Rains of March - May, there is a strong indication based on IPCC climate projections that this trend, which has persisted for several decades, will reverse in the next few decades. This phenomenon has come to be known as the Eastern-Central African climate change paradox and could have profound implications on sustainable development for the next few decades in Lake Victoria Basin.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the climate variability associated with the East African Climate Change Paradox for the recent decades. This research analyzes observations to understand the sources of variability and potential physical mechanisms related to the decline in precipitation over Eastern Africa. We then investigate the hydrological factors involved in the decline of Lake Victoria levels in the context of the decline in rainfall.\nWhile East Africa has been experiencing persistent decline of the Long Rains for multiple decades, this same decline is not seen in annual rainfall. The remaining seasons show an increase in rainfall which is compensating for the decline of the Long Rains. It is possible that the Long Rains season is shifting in such a way that the season starts earlier, in February, and ending sooner. The corresponding annual Lake Victoria levels modeled using observed rainfall do not decline in the recent decades, except when the Long Rains seasonal variability is considered without variability from other seasons. This shift could impact hydroelectric power planning on a monthly or seasonal time scale, and could potentially have a large impact on agriculture, since it would shift the growing season in the region.",

            "abstract": "Observational evidence, including offshore moraines and marine sediment cores infer that at the Last Glacial maximum (LGM) the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) grounded out across the Davis Strait into Baffin Bay, with fast flowing ice streams extending out to the continental shelf break along the NW margin. These observations lead to a number of questions as to weather the GIS and Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) coalesced during glacial maximums, and if so, did a significant ice shelf develop across Baffin Bay and how would such a configuration impact on the relative contribution of these ice sheets to eustatic sea level (ESL).\nMost previous paleo ice sheet modelling simulations of the GIS recreated an ice sheet that either did not extend out onto the continental shelf or utilised a simplified marine ice parameterisation to recreate an extended GIS, and therefore did not fully include ice shelf dynamics.\nIn this study we simulate the evolution of the GIS from 220 kyr BP to present day using IMAU-ice; a 3D thermodynamical ice sheet model which fully accounts for grounded and floating ice, calculates grounding line migration and ice shelf dynamics. There is few observational estimates of long-term (yrs) sub marine basal melting rates (mbm) for the GIS. Therefore we investigate a range of relationships to constrain the spatial and temporal parameterisation of mbm within IMAU-ice related to changes in paleo water depth, driven by changes in relative sea level and ocean temperature.\nWe will present results of how changes in the mbm directly impacts on the ice sheet dynamics, timing and spatial extent of the GIS at the glacial maximums, but also on the rate of retreat and spatial extent at the Last interglacial (LIG) minimum. Initial results indicate that with the inclusion of ice shelf dynamics, a larger GIS is generated which is grounded out into Davis strait, up to a water depth of -750 m, but the total contribution to LIG ESL is reduced by up to 0.6 m.",

            "abstract": "Two history matching models are proposed for subsurface characterization based on the simulated annealing method with unconditional geostatistical simulation and a radial basis function network as random walk transition kernels. For verification, the developed models and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) based history matching are comparatively applied to two synthetic cases. In Case 1, history curves at 16 observation wells and the statistical information on the targeted properties are fully informed while, in Case 2, only the hydraulic measurements are available. Through in-depth comparisons, it is concluded that the developed models as well as the EnKF based history matching model show reasonable prediction accuracy with full information on spatial statistics of Case 1, whereas the prediction accuracies of the models are severely deteriorated with reduced information in Case 2. For both cases, the developed simulated annealing (SA) based history matching model with a radial basis function network has the highest predictability and the EnKF model shows similar prediction accuracy. However, from the perspective of the prediction stability, the EnKF model is found to be inferior to the developed models. This inferiority of the EnKF model is attributed to the sensitivity of the model to the composition of the initial ensemble.",

            "abstract": "Clouds cover more than 60% of the globe with high impacts on incoming solar irradiance on the ground as well as the radiative energy transfer in the Earth–atmosphere system. Several method for detecting clouds from sky images have been developed, and digital signals available from the JPEG image have nonlinear relationship with the corresponding spectral radiances, which may lead to cloud misclassifications. In this work, a method for cloud discrimination from sky images in RAW format taken from a commercial digital camera is developed. The method uses the clear sky index (CSI). In order to take into account the spectral response in red–green–blue (RGB) channels of the camera as well as lens characteristics, these characteristics are first inferred very accurately with a laboratory experiment. Spectral radiance is represented in a simple form with spectra of incoming solar radiation at the top of atmosphere and ozone transmittance and a polynominal with three coefficients that include the intensity index, the molecular index (MI) and the small particle index (SPI). These coefficients can be obtained from the digital RGB RAW counts by linear transformation. The MI and the SPI can be converted to the CSI, which takes different value from that at clear sky and cloudy pixels. Simultaneous observations with the lidar and the digital camera at Tohoku University show that the CSI can discriminate cloud and clear sky at every pixel with correct discrimination rate more than 90%. Furthermore, spectral distribution of sky radiance can also be estimated at every pixel, and estimated ones are consistent with those from spectrometer and those from radiative transfer simulations under various sky conditions in a wavelength range of 430–680 nm with mean biases lower than 3% and bias standard deviations smaller than 1%.",

We first use the LMDZ5 AGCM of the\nLaboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique coupled to a slab ocean, with realistic\nzonal asymmetries and seasonal cycle. Two anomalous surface heatings\nreproducing the impact of an idealized AMOC strenghtening are imposed: (a)\nuniform heating over the North Atlantic basin, and (b) concentrated heating in\nthe Gulf Stream region; in both cases a compensating uniform cooling in the Southern\nOcean is applied. The magnitude of the heating, and of the implied northward\ninter-hemispheric heat transport, are within the range of current natural\nvariability.\nBoth simulations show global effects, which can be interpreted as a\ncompensation by the atmosphere of the anomalous oceanic heat transport: the\nIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts north toward the heating\nanomalies. This shift is accompanied by a northward shift of the jets and storm\ntracks in both hemispheres, consistent with anomalous soutward heat transport\nby transient eddies in the subtropics.\nIn the extra-tropics, the clear-sky radiative response tends to damp the\nprescribed anomalies, while the cloud response acts as a large positive\nfeedback on the oceanic forcing, mainly due to the low-cloud induced shortwave\nanomalies. In the tropics, the clear-sky response is dominated instead by\nhumidity changes and reinforces the ITCZ movements.\nWe then use a fully coupled GCM in glacial conditions, in which a freshwater\nflux (\"hosing\") is added in the North Atlantic to weaken the AMOC. We still\nobserve a strong compensation between the ocean and atmosphere heat transports,\nas well as a southward shift of the ITCZ, and of the Southern Hemisphere jet\nand storm tracks.

            "abstract": "The Red sSea extensional system started approximately 22+3 Ma. Although, there is evidence that lithospheric weakening and associated incipient extension may have taken place since 30 Ma. There is oceanic crust found in the southern part of the rift, while the northern-most part still involves continental stretching. Meantime magnetic anomalies have been observed for the southern rift, the northern rift is characterized by several deeps where magnetic anomalies have been observed as well as an indication of the transition from continental to oceanic rifting. GPS stations along the Red Sea are consistent with kinematics implied from the magnetic anomalies - an opening rate in the southern part of ~ 15 mm/yr relative to Eurasia fixed while the opening rate in the is ~8 mm/yr. This significant decreasing of the opening rate towards the north implies complexity within the Red Sea extensional system.\nOur purpose here is to place the Red Sea extensional kinematics within the regional tectonics context by combining constraints on the rate or style of extension within the Red Sea with tectonic activities on the adjacent continental regions. To accomplish this, we will model the extensional kinematics through time by comparing recent kinematics based on the geophysical observations with ones that based on geological observations. In terms of present-day geophysical observations, we have GPS and magnetic anomalies data, and crustal and lithospheric thickness. Geological observations primarily come from stratigraphic and structural data sets.\nOur overall target is to construct a tectonic model that links the timing of the change in the style and extensional rate with the tectonic activities in Afar, Gulf of Aden, Zagros, Dead Sea fault and Anatolian region.",

            "abstract": "Strength and inland penetration of the oceanic westerly flow over Europe control a large part of the temperature variability over most of the continent. Reduced westerlies, linked to high-pressure anomalies over Scandinavia, induce cold conditions in winter and warm conditions in summer. Here we propose to define the onset of these two seasons as the calendar day where the daily circulation/temperature relationship over Western Europe switches sign. According to this meteorologically-based metrics assessed from several observational datasets, we provide robust evidence for an earlier summer onset by ~10 days between the 1960s and 2000s. Results from model ensemble simulations dedicated to detection-attribution show that this calendar advance is incompatible with the sole internal climate variability and can be attributed to anthropogenic forcings. Late winter snow disappearance over Eastern Europe affects cold air intrusion to the West when easterlies blow, and is mainly responsible for the observed present-day and near-future summer advance. Our findings agree with phenological-based trends (earlier spring events) reported for many living species over Europe, for which they provide a novel dynamical interpretation beyond the traditionally evoked global warming effect. Based on business-as-usual scenario, a seasonal shift of ~25 days is expected by 2100 for summer onset, while no clear signal arises for winter onset.",

            "abstract": "The confluence of 3-Dimensional printing, low-cost solid-state-sensors, low-cost, low-power digital controllers (e.g., Arduinos); and open-source publishing (e.g., Github) is poised to transform environmental sensing. The Open-Source Published Environmental Sensing (OPENS) laboratory has launched and is available for all to use. OPENS combines cutting edge technologies and makes them available to the global environmental sensing community. OPENS includes a Maker lab space where people may collaborate in person or virtually via on-line forum for the publication and discussion of environmental sensing technology (Corvallis, Oregon, USA, please feel free to request a free reservation for space and equipment use). The physical lab houses a test-bed for sensors, as well as a complete classical machine shop, 3-D printers, electronics development benches, and workstations for code development. OPENS will provide a web-based formal publishing framework wherein global students and scientists can peer-review publish (with DOI) novel and evolutionary advancements in environmental sensor systems. This curated and peer-reviewed digital collection will include complete sets of “printable” parts and operating computer code for sensing systems. The physical lab will include all of the machines required to produce these sensing systems. These tools can be addressed in person or virtually, creating a truly global venue for advancement in monitoring earth’s environment and agricultural systems. In this talk we will present an example of the process of design and publication the design and data from the OPENS-Permeameter. The publication includes 3-D printing code, Arduino (or other control/logging platform) operational code; sample data sets, and a full discussion of the design set in the scientific context of previous related devices.

            "abstract": "The search for sustainability and resilience requires the integration of natural science with social science, as well as the joint production of knowledge and solutions by science and society. In this context, international science coordination initiatives, like Future Earth, have increasingly stressed the need to perform more integrated and more socially relevant research. This contribution has the objective to highlight the potential role of a research coordination initiative, the Global Land Programme (GLP), to provide guidance for more integrative research. The need to perform integrative research is particularly true for land systems, which include dynamic interactions among social and natural drivers that are often multifunctional. Thus, their governance and management is particularity complex and involve highly diverse stakeholders. A key aspect of integrative research is co-production of knowledge, understood as the interactive production of knowledge by both academics and non-academics, that leads to new forms of solutions-oriented knowledge. We relied on experiences of co-production of knowledge on land systems from the GLP network, and drove seven lessons learnt: 1) the importance of including several learning loops in the process, 2) the importance of long-term relationships, 3) the need to overcome the distinction between basic and applied science, 4) the opportunities offered by new communication technologies, 5) the need to train professionals in both breadth and depth, 6) the access to knowledge, and 7) the need to understand better the roles of scientists and decision-makers. These lessons were used to define action-research priorities for enhancing co-production of knowledge on land systems in GLP projects and working groups. As a conclusion, we argue that research coordination initiatives have the potential to provide analysis and guidance for more integrative research. This can be done by performing synthesis and self-reflection activities that feed back into research and action.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, the atmosphere of Mars is commonly assumed to be much different than in the early times of its evolution. Especially, the escape of water and carbon dioxide is thought to have formed its shape during millions of years. Also the Sun emitted a higher EUV flux in former times, influencing the particle environment around Mars.\nWe study the escape of oxygen and carbon from the early Martian atmosphere for different EUV fluxes with a Monte-Carlo model. We consider different possible sources of hot oxygen and carbon atoms in the thermosphere, e.g. dissociative recombination of O2+ , CO+ and CO2+ , photodissociation of O2 and CO, and other reactions like charge transfer. From the calculated production rate profiles we can get insights into the importance of the different source reactions. The resulting energy distribution functions at the exobase level are used to study the exospheric densities and the escape of hot oxygen and carbon. We discuss the escape rates of those atoms and the importance of different source processes compared to the present situation at Mars.\nThis work receives funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P 24247.",

This was done through application of fuzzy c-mean clustering to back-trajectory data combined with emission flux and residence time weighted aerosols analysis. WinMon mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom exponent (AE) at Kol were respectively slightly higher than and nearly equal to that at Kgp. Out of six source region clusters over Indian subcontinent and two over Indian oceanic region, the cluster mean AOD was the highest when associated with the mean path of air mass originating from the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the Arabian sea (AS) clusters at Kol and that from the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP)cluster at Kgp. Spatial distribution of weighted AOD fields showed the highest potential source of aerosols over the IGP, majorly over upper IGP (IGP-U), lower IGP (IGP-L) and eastern region (ER) clusters. The emission flux contribution potential (EFCP) of fossil fuel (FF) emissions at surface (SL) of Kol/Kgp , elevated layer (EL) of Kol, and of biomass burning (BB) emissions at SL of Kol were majorly from IGP-U, IGP-L and IGP-U/L clusters respectively. The EFCP of FF/BB emissions at Kgp-EL/SL, and that of BB at EL of Kol/Kgp were mainly from ER and Africa (AFR) clusters respectively. Though the AFR cluster was constituted of significantly high emission flux source potential of dust emissions, the EFCP of dust from NWI was comparable to that from AFR at Kol SL/EL.",

            "abstract": "The sensitivity of water isotope ratios in precipitation to climate variations in the Southern Hemisphere is investigated with an intermediate complexity isotope model (ICM) that includes updated equilibrium and kinetic fractionation factors for temperatures below zero. NCEP2 reanalysis data, with permutations to the surface temperature and humidity fields, are used as model boundary conditions. Decreases in ocean surface relative humidity result in increased 17Oexcess and dexcess, with a uniform response over the ocean and Antarctic continent. The response of 17Oexcess to a global temperature change is insignificant over the ocean, but there is a strong 17Oexcess response over the ice sheet, particularly in East Antarctica. The simulated seasonal cycle in 17Oexcess for East Antarctica is positively correlated with δ18O and of large magnitude (~50 per meg), in agreement with observations at Vostok. The seasonal cycle in 17Oexcess for West Antarctica is predicted to be smaller in magnitude (~12 per meg) and of opposite sign. The 17Oexcess seasonal cycle over the ocean is only ~3 per meg for the West Antarctic sector and ~8 per meg for the East Antarctic sector, neither of which are large enough to explain the full seasonal changes over the ice sheet produced by the ICM or observed in ice cores. The sensitivity of 17Oexcess to local site temperature, and both the modern spatial distribution and seasonal variability of 17Oexcess and dexcess over the ice sheet, reflect the proportion of equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during snow formation. To simulate the present-day 17Oexcess observations requires that the sensitivity of supersaturation to temperature to be relatively high. Evaporative recharge is also found to be an important process that reduces the variability of 17Oexcess and dexcess over the ocean. Evidence is provided that the simulation of kinetic fractionation during snow formation may require the inclusion of a term that accounts for turbulence.",

            "abstract": "A soil’s shear resistance is mainly dependent upon the magnitude of effective stress. For small to medium height slopes (up to 10m) in clay soils the total stress acting along potential failure planes will be low, therefore the magnitude of effective stress (and hence soil shear strength) will be dominated by the pore-water pressure. The stability of slopes on this scale through periods of increased precipitation is improved by the generation of negative pore pressures (soil suctions) during preceding, warmer, drier periods. These negative pore water pressures increase the effective stress within the soil and cause a corresponding increase in shearing resistance.\nThe relationships between soil water content and pore water pressure (soil water retention curves) are known to be hysteretic, but for the purposes of the majority of slope stability assessments in partially saturated clay soils, these are assumed to be consistent with time. Similarly, the relationship between shear strength and water content is assumed to be consistent over time. This research presents a laboratory study in which specimens of compacted Glacial Till (typical of engineered slopes within the UK) were subjected to repeated cycles of wetting and drying to simulate seasonal cycles. At predetermined water contents, measurements of soil suction were made using tensiometer and dewpoint potentiometer methods. The undrained shear strength of the specimens was then measured using triaxial strength testing equipment.\nResults indicate that repeated wetting and drying cycles caused a change in the soil water retention behaviour. A reduction in undrained shear strength at corresponding water contents along the wetting and drying paths was also observed. The mechanism for the change in the relationship is believed to be a deterioration in the soil physical structure due to shrink/swell induced micro-cracking. The non-stationarity of these relationships has implications for slope stability assessment.",

            "abstract": "In the Grenville Province of Southern Ontario, the Central Metasedimentary Belt boundary thrust zone (CMBbtz) is a crustal-scale tectonic boundary between the older, granulite-facies Central Gneiss Belt to the NW and the younger, amphibolite-facies Central Metasedimentary Belt to the SE. Although there are a range of tectonic models for the CMBbtz, most workers agree it is a major tectonic boundary that accommodated ductile thrusting and crustal shortening during the Ottawan phase of the Grenville Orogeny (~1080-1020 Ma). Some studies suggest that ductile thrusting in the CMBbtz was roughly synchronous with synorogenic extensional collapse below an orogenic lid. Previous geochronological studies also provide evidence of earlier deformation and/or metamorphic events in the CMBbtz, although the relation between deformation in the CMBbtz to the Elzeviran (~1230 Ma) and Shawinigan (~1180 Ma) orogenies is unclear. Our study is the first to report in situ electron microprobe monazite (mnz) dates from amphibolite-grade ortho- and para-gneisses of the CMBbtz. Our results are broadly consistent with other chronometers. We present dates from 132 age-domains within 83 mnz grains in 14 samples. Although our data provide strong evidence for deformation and metamorphism along the length of the CMBbtz during the Ottawan (1080-1020 Ma), we also report two other clusters of ages: 1140-1110 Ma and 1230-1170 Ma. The latter cluster falls between the widely accepted ranges for the Elzeviran and Shawinigan orogenies. In addition, some individual outcrops, particularly those in Killaloe and Minden, show mnz ages spanning over 200 m.y., and the setting and compositions of individual monazite domains allow us to link mnz growth to episodes of garnet growth during multiple events. Together these data indicate an unexpectedly continuous and long-lived period of deformation and metamorphism in the CMBbtz.",

            "abstract": "The global rise in population-driven water scarcity and recent appreciation of strong dynamic coupling between human and natural systems has called for new approaches to predict the future sustainability of regional and global water resources systems. The dynamics of coupled human-water systems are driven by a complex set of social, environmental, and technological factors. Present projections of water resources systems range from a finite carrying capacity regulated by accessible freshwater, or `peak renewable water,’ to punctuated evolution with new supplied and improved efficiency gained from technological and social innovation. However, these projections have yet to be quantified from observations or in a comprehensive theoretical framework. Using data on global water withdrawals and storage capacity of regional water supply systems, non-trivial dynamics are identified in water resources systems development over time, including power-law growth and punctuated equilibria. Two models are introduced to explain this behavior: (1) a delay differential equation and (2) a power-law with log-periodic oscillations, both of which rely on past conditions (or system memory) to describe the present rate of growth in the system. In addition, extension of the first model demonstrates how system delays and punctuated equilibria can emerge from coupling between human population growth and associated resource demands. Lastly, anecdotal evidence is used to demonstrate the likelihood of power-law growth in global water use from the agricultural revolution 3000 BC to the present. In a practical sense, the presence of these patterns in models with delayed oscillations suggests that current decision-making related to water resources development results from the historical accumulation of resource use decisions, technological and social changes, and their consequences.",

Homogeneous locator is a homogeneous function and point based algorithm that uses magnetic field intensity and its first and second order tensors. If using all magnetic data points for inversion of the locations of magnetic dipole sources, more solutions than actual targets will be produced. Also, interference from neighboring magnetic sources and noise will deteriorate the situation and make the locating task even more difficult. To improve such a situation, we investigated and compared various cases with different levels of interference and noise, and using a combination of the homogeneous locator and the positions of extreme values for inversion. Results show that (1) if the interference and noise levels are low, using magnetic and its first and second tensor values at the positions where the first vertical derivative of the magnetic field has extreme values – either maximum or minimum as inputs to the homogeneous locator resulted in the best results – accurate horizontal and vertical locations and structure indices; (2) if the interference and noise level are high, using magnetic and its first and second tensor values at the positions where the magnetic field intensity has extreme values as inputs to the homogeneous locator resulted in the best horizontal locations, but still using the values at the positions where the first vertical derivative of the magnetic field has extreme values produce the best vertical locations and structure indices. We applied the verified scheme to the field data for UXO detection and aeromagnetic data of Minnesota for geological structure study and the results are compared to Euler deconvolution and sole homogeneous locator method.",

OlyMPUS leverages the semantics and reasoning capabilities of ODISEES to provide data producers with a semi-automated interface for producing the semantically rich metadata needed to support ODISEES’ data discovery and access services. It integrates the ODISEES metadata search system with multiple NASA data delivery tools to enable data consumers to create customized data sets for download to their computers, or for NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility registered users, directly to NAS storage resources for access by applications running on NAS supercomputers.\nA core function of NASA’s Earth Science Division is research and analysis that uses the full spectrum of data products available in NASA archives. Scientists need to perform complex analyses that identify correlations and non-obvious relationships across all types of Earth System phenomena. Comprehensive analytics are hindered, however, by the fact that many Earth science data products are disparate and hard to synthesize. Variations in how data are collected, processed, gridded, and stored, create challenges for data interoperability and synthesis, which are exacerbated by the sheer volume of available data. Robust, semantically rich metadata can support tools for data discovery and facilitate machine-to-machine transactions with services such as data subsetting, regridding, and reformatting. Such capabilities are critical to enabling the research activities integral to NASA’s strategic plans. However, as metadata requirements increase and competing standards emerge, metadata provisioning becomes increasingly burdensome to data producers. The OlyMPUS system helps data providers produce semantically rich metadata, making their data more accessible to data consumers, and helps data consumers quickly discover and download the right data for their research.",

We are working on the comprehensive study using multiple approaches that integrate observations extracted from remote sensing with traditional approaches (surficial geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, GIS, and hydrologic modeling) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the response of a large-scale Irtysh River Basin hydrologic system to a variety of climatic and anthropic forcing parameters. Global warming over the study area could cause higher temperatures, increased evaporation, decreased precipitation, and droughts. On the other hand, the impacts could be just the opposite, increased precipitation rates and floods. Anthropic forcing influences over the Irtysh River Basin could result from impoundment of surface water by dams or decreased flow due to water diversion projects and excessive groundwater extraction from the surrounding aquifers. The ultimate objective of these investigations will be a predictive capability that can relate forcing by climate change and anthropic activities to anticipated hydrologic system responses. UNESCO-IHP network and cooperation support can very helpful for this complex research work. The current research findings will be shared during the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Eureka Valley-Joshua Flat-Beer Creek (EJB) pluton in eastern California is surrounded by a ~1.3 km wide intensely deformed concordant aureole of metasedimentary rocks. South of the pluton, the Harkless Quartzite can be mapped from where it is located outside the aureole, with its regional strike through the transition into the aureole and concordancy with the pluton. The transition into concordancy, which is fairly abrupt, occurs over a distance of less than 100 m. Across this transition the bedding rotates close to 90° to become subvertical. Here the metasedimentary formations in the aureole have undergone 65% shortening. A suite of Harkless Quartzite samples was collected starting at 2.3 km south of the pluton, across the transition into concordancy at 1.3 km, and to within 450m from the pluton contact. Microstructurally, the transition is defined by changes in the dominant recrystallization mechanisms. At 2.3 km from the pluton, subgrain rotation recrystallization (SGR) plus grain boundary migration (GBM) operate together and many sedimentary grains (rounded grain boundaries) exist. As the pluton is approached, SGR decreases, GBM increases, and rounded grain boundaries slowly disappear. The abrupt transition into concordancy is marked by the final disappearance of SGR and rounded grain boundaries and extensive GBM. The transition is not completely smooth, and other variables such as pinning and amount of fluid inclusions seem to have a strong local affect on the dominant recrystallization mechanism. We suspect that the onset of extensive GBM allows for the diffusion of water into the crystal lattice which results in the drastic weakening and rotation of metasedimentary formations into concordancy.",

            "abstract": "It is believed that the iron-rich Earth’s core contains some amounts of light elements on the basis of the density deficit of 7 % compared to pure iron. The identification of the kinds and amounts of the light elements in the core places constraints on the origin, formation, and evolution of the Earth because dissolution of light elements into an iron-rich core should place important constraints on the thermodynamic conditions (pressure (P), temperature (T), and oxygen fugacity) of the equilibration between liquid silicate and liquid iron during the core formation. Among potential light elements, silicon has been attracting attentions because it is abundant in the mantle, partitioned into both solid and liquid irons, and very sensitive to the oxygen fugacity.\nAn important phase relation in iron alloy is a transition between the face-centred cubic (FCC) structure and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. This boundary is a key to infer the stable structure in the inner core and is used to derive thermodynamic properties of the phases (Komabayashi, 2014). In the Fe-Si system, previous reports were based on experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DAC), which might have included large termperature uncertainties.\nWe have revisited this boundary in the system Fe-Si using an internally resistive-heated DAC combined with synchrotron X-ray diffraction at the beamline ID27, ESRF. The internally-heated DAC (Komabayashi et al., 2009; 2012) provides much more stable heating than the laser-heated DAC and much higher temperature than externally resistive-heated DAC, which enables us to place tight constraints on the P-T locations of the boundaries. Also because the minimum measurable temperature is as low as 1000 K due to the stable electric heating, the internal heating is able to examine the low temperature phase stability which was not studied by the previous studies. We will report the P-T locations of the boundaries and evaluate the effect of Si on the phase relation of Earth’s core materials.\n  ",

            "abstract": "The OCO-2 instrument was successfully launched on July 2, 2014 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The instrument reached its observational orbit about three weeks later. The spacecraft is at the head of the A-train satellites and began collecting operational data on Sept 5, 2014. OCO-2 makes measurements in three modes: nadir, glint and target. Target observations are designed to provide large amounts of data in a small area near a ground validation site. The instruments of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) provide the ground validation data for the OCO-2 XCO2 observations and comparisons to TCCON form the basis of the OCO-2 validation plan.\nThere are now 27 locations at which OCO-2 can perform target observations and CCON sites make up 23 of those possible target locations. For its first year in orbit, OCO-2 operated in nadir mode for 16 days and then in glint mode for 16 days. Each 16-day cycle spans 233 orbits. On July 1, 2015, OCO-2 changed to an observational mode of alternating nadir and glint measurements on an orbit-by-orbit basis. By December 2015, this operational mode may be modified such that orbits that measure only over ocean will always observed in glint mode.\nIn this presentation we will provide information on the observations made by OCO-2 during its first 15 month in operations. We will show maps of the OCO-2 ground tracks and XCO2 data, calendars illustrating the observational schedule and statistics on the target observations taken. We will provide more information on what is involved in making target observations and how it affects the standard operational data acquisition patterns. Changes to the standard observational patterns of OCO-2 and to the list of locations for target observations will be discussed as well. We will provide an overview of some of the validation related analysis being done using nadir and glint mode OCO-2 data in addition to an overview on validation analyses that do not directly utilize TCCON data.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater inflow due to convective rains or river runoff produces lenses of freshened water in the near surface layer of the ocean. These lenses are localized in space and typically involve both salinity and temperature anomalies. Due to significant density anomalies, strong pressure gradients develop, which result in lateral spreading of freshwater lenses in a form resembling gravity currents. Gravity currents inherently involve three-dimensional dynamics. The gravity current head can include the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows with vertical density inversions. In this work, we have conducted a series of numerical experiments using computational fluid dynamics tools. These numerical simulations were designed to elucidate the relationship between vertical mixing and horizontal advection of salinity under various environmental conditions and potential impact on the pollution transport including oil spills. The near-surface data from the field experiments in the Gulf of Mexico during the SCOPE experiment were available for validation of numerical simulations. In particular, we observed a freshwater layer within a few-meter depth range and, in some cases, a density inversion at the edge of the freshwater lens, which is consistent with the results of numerical simulations. In conclusion, we discuss applicability of these results to the interpretation of Aquarius and SMOS sea surface salinity satellite measurements. The results of this study indicate that 3D dynamics of the near-surface layer of the ocean are essential in the presence of freshwater inflow.",

            "abstract": "As an intrinsic factor in national security, the global economy, food and energy production, and human and ecological health, fresh water resources are increasingly being considered by an ever-widening array of stakeholders. The U.S. intelligence community has identified water as a key factor in the Nation’s security risk profile. Water industries are growing rapidly, and seek to revolutionize the role of water in the global economy, making water an economic value rather than a limitation on operations. Recent increased focus on the complex interrelationships and interdependencies between water, food, and energy signal a renewed effort to move towards integrated water resource management. Throughout all of this, hydrologic extremes continue to wreak havoc on communities and regions around the world, in some cases threatening long-term economic stability.\nThis increased attention on water coincides with the “second IT revolution” of cyber-infrastructure (CI). The CI concept is a convergence of technology, data, applications and human resources, all coalescing into a tightly integrated global grid of computing, information, networking and sensor resources, and ultimately serving as an engine of change for collaboration, education and scientific discovery and innovation. In the water arena, we have unprecedented opportunities to apply the CI concept to help address complex water challenges and shape the future world of water resources – on both science and socio-economic application fronts. Providing actionable local “water intelligence” nationally or globally is now becoming feasible through high-performance computing, data technologies, and advanced hydrologic modeling. Further development on all of these fronts appears likely and will help advance this much-needed capability. Lagging behind are water observation systems, especially in situ networks, which need significant innovation to keep pace with and help fuel rapid advancements in water intelligence.",

            "abstract": "The Vector-Vorticity Dynamical core (VVM) developed by Jung and Arakawa (2008) has important advantages for the use with the anelastic and unified systems of equations. The VVM predicts the horizontal vorticity vector (HVV) at each interface and the vertical vorticity at the top layer of the model. To guarantee that the three-dimensional vorticity is nondivergent, the vertical vorticity at the interior layers is diagnosed from the horizontal divergence of the HVV through a vertical integral from the top to down. To our knowledge, this is the only dynamical core that guarantees the nondivergence of the three-dimensional vorticity.\nThe VVM uses a C-type horizontal grid, which allows a computational mode. While the computational mode does not seem to be serious in the Cartesian grid applications, it may be serious in the icosahedral grid applications because of the extra degree of freedom in such grids. Although there are special filters to minimize the effects of this computational mode, we prefer to eliminate it altogether.\nWe have developed a new dynamical core, which uses a Z-grid to avoid the computational mode mentioned above. The dynamical core predicts the curl of the HVV and diagnoses the horizontal divergence of the HVV from the predicted vertical vorticity. The three-dimensional vorticity is guaranteed to be nondivergent as in the VVM.\nIn this presentation, we will introduce the new dynamical core and show results obtained by using Cartesian and hexagonal grids. We will also compare the solutions to that obtained by the VVM.",

            "abstract": "At high frequencies, the acceleration spectral amplitude decreases rapidly; this has been modeled with the spectral decay factor κ (Anderson and Hough, 1984). Its site-specific component, κ0, an index of site attenuation in the upper crust, is used widely today in ground motion prediction and simulation. Here we use accelerometric data from the EUROSEISTEST valley, a geologically complex and seismically active region in Greece. The strong motion array consists of 14 surface and 6 downhole stations. Site conditions across the stations vary greatly, ranging from soft sediments to hard rock (NEHRP class D to A). We use the results to improve our physical understanding of κ0 and propose a conceptual model of κ0 with Vs. This model comprises two new notions. On the one hand, and contrary to existing correlations, we observe that κ0 stabilizes for high Vs values. This may indicate the existence of regional κ0 values for hard rock. If so, we propose that borehole measurements (which have almost never been used up to now for κ0) may be useful in determining these values. On the other hand, we find that material damping in the soil column, as expressed through travel times, does not suffice to account for the total κ0 measured at the surface. We propose that, apart from material damping, additional site attenuation may be caused by scattering from small-scale variability in the profile. If this is so, then geotechnical damping measurements may not suffice to infer the overall attenuation underneath a site; but starting with a regional value (possibly measured from a downhole station) and adding damping, we might define a lower bound for site-specific κ0. More precise estimates would necessitate seismological site instrumentation.",

            "abstract": "Studies of earthquake-induced landsliding typically consider slope stability during high-magnitude ground shaking events only. During such events, downslope movement of the landslide mass occurs when seismic ground accelerations are sufficient to overcome shear resistance at the landslide shear surface. This approach does not consider the potential effects that sequences of low-magnitude ground shaking events can have on material strength and, hence, coseismic slope stability. Since such events are more common in nature relative to high-magnitude shaking events, it is important to constrain their geomorphic effectiveness. Using an experimental laboratory approach, we present results that address this key issue. We used a bespoke geotechnical testing apparatus, the Dynamic Back-Pressured Shear Box, that permits realistic simulation of earthquake ground-shaking conditions within a hillslope. We tested both cohesive and granular materials that displayed ductile behaviour under standard strain-controlled monotonic shear tests. We applied dynamic stresses of varying amplitude, frequency and sequence, and monitored the resultant strain response to determine which factors, when combined, created notable deviations from standard monotonic shear behaviour. We observed that multiple dynamic stress/shaking events that are largely insufficient to cause large strains (and hence are conventionally deemed geomorphologically ineffective) can affect material stiffness such that the future behaviour of the sediment/landslide differs considerably from that observed in standard monotonic shear tests. In other words, low-magnitude ground shaking events can be effective precursory geomorphic processes. Critically, the sequence of ground-shaking events is an important control; where shaking conditions cause progressive densification of sediment, the frictional strength of the material subsequently increases. In turn, the resultant strain response to high-magnitude ground shaking events decreases. Our results have important implications for studies of long-term landscape evolution, in which modelled hillslopes are repeatedly subjected to multiple earthquake events but that currently lack appropriate empirically-constrained strength parameters.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is one of the main water reservoirs used for irrigation in regions of scarce water resources. For this reason, crop irrigation is expected to have a direct influence on this reservoir. To understand the time evolution of the groundwater table and its storage changes, it is important to delineate irrigated crops, whose evaporative demand is relatively higher. Such delineation may be performed based on classical classification approaches using optical remote sensing. However, it remains a difficult problem in regions where plots do not exceed a few hectares and exhibit a very heterogeneous pattern with multiple crops. This difficulty is emphasized in South India where two or three months of cloudy conditions during the monsoon period can hide crop growth during the year.\nAn alternative approach is introduced here that takes advantage of such scarce signal. Ten different crops are considered in the present study. A bank of crop models is first established based on the global modeling technique [1]. These models are then tested using original time series (from which models were obtained) in order to evaluate the information that can be deduced from these models in an inverse approach. The approach is then tested on an independent data set and is finally applied to a large ensemble of 10,000 time series of plot data extracted from the Berambadi catchment (AMBHAS site) part of the Kabini River basin CZO, South India.\nResults show that despite the important two-month gap in satellite observations in the visible band, interpolated vegetation index remains an interesting indicator for identification of crops in South India.\n[1] S.

            "abstract": "In the study of paleoclimate, the past several decades have seen large strides in the advancement of proxies designed to reconstruct changes in sea surface temperature (SST); however, techniques for reconstructing ocean salinity are less well developed. The ratio of Ba/Ca in planktic foraminiferal tests has shown initial promise as a tool for reconstructing salinity in continental margin sites near river mouths. In these environments, Ba/Ca shows an inverse correlation with salinity, and often a less clear correlation to nutrients or indicators of productivity, as is more typical in open-ocean settings. An ideal area in which to apply and test foraminiferal Ba/Ca as a proxy for freshwater input is the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP), where temperatures are relatively stable, but large variations in precipitation are today driven by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and strength of the Australian-Indonesian monsoon. Foraminiferal Ba/Ca in sediments proximal to a river mouth should therefore reflect changes in riverine input, which in turn reflect variations in precipitation on different timescales. We present here planktic foraminiferal δ18O, Ba/Ca, and Mg/Ca records spanning the last glacial-interglacial transition from marine sediment cores in the Gulf of Papua, located in the WPWP.\nThe δ18O records show an increase in the magnitude of glacial-interglacial (G-IG) δ18O change (∆18O) moving away from the coastline and the mouth of the primary local freshwater source, the Fly River. The reduced amplitude in G-IG ∆18O in the cores closer to shore, manifested by more negative δ18O values before ~20 kyr ago, is likely due to freshwater input from the Fly River, with the effects diminishing with distance from the Fly River source. Temperature and sea level are also changing over the deglaciation, however, contributing to the signal recorded in the calcite δ18O. We use planktic Mg/Ca analyses and independent records of sea level change to isolate the component of foraminiferal δ18O that is due to salinity, which we then compare to the Ba/Ca records. With continued work toward proxy development, Ba/Ca has the potential to provide insight into past changes in precipitation in the WPWP in response to large or rapid climate change.",

            "abstract": "Storage of supercritical CO2 in deep saline geologic formation is under study as a means to mitigate potential global climate change from green house gas loading to the atmosphere. Leakage of CO2 from these formations poses risk to the storage permanence goal of 99% of injected CO2 remaining sequestered from the atmosphere,. Leaked CO2 that migrates into overlying groundwater aquifers may cause changes in groundwater quality that pose risks to environmental and human health. For these reasons, technologies for monitoring, measuring and accounting of injected CO2 are necessary for permitting of CO2 sequestration projects under EPA’s class VI CO2 injection well regulations. While the probability of leakage related to CO2 injection is thought to be small at characterized and permitted sites, it is still very important to protect the groundwater resources and develop methods that can efficiently and accurately detect CO2 leakage. Methods that have been proposed for leakage detection include remote sensing, soil gas monitoring, geophysical techniques, pressure monitoring, vegetation stress and eddy covariance measurements. We have demonstrated the use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) for monitoring of subsurface contaminant plumes. The adaptability of this technology for leakage monitoring of CO2 through geochemical changes in the shallow subsurface is explored. For this technology to be viable, it is necessary to identify geochemical indicators such as pH or electrical conductivity that have high potential for significant change in groundwater in the event of CO2 leakage. This talk presents a conceptual approach to use WSNs for CO2 leakage monitoring. Based on our past work on the use of WSN for subsurface monitoring, some of the challenges that need to be over come for this technology to be viable for leakage detection will be discussed.",

The general objective of this experiment is to improve our understanding of the pressure, temperature and stress changes in the rock mass due to hydraulic stimulation. In this context, the main goal is to investigate the effect of hydro-shearing on the local stress variation as well as transient and permanent permeability changes with comprehensive thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) and acoustic emission monitoring. This experiment is designed such that stimulation processes are recorded in a dataset that is unique in THM coupled processes and induced seismicity research.\nIn preparation to the hydro-shearing experiments, the experimental rock volume has been studied in detail using geological tunnel mapping, optical televiewer in existing boreholes, hydraulic tests, geophysical imaging and review of the extensive literature on experiments at the Grimsel Test Site. The geophysical investigations include reflection and transmission ground penetrating radar (GPR) and seismic measurements between the tunnels to image shear zones and reveal heterogeneity of the rock mass. The orientation and magnitude of the principal stresses of the rock volume and its surroundings has been analyzed using hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic tests on pre-existing fractures and overcoring. The hydraulic fracturing tests for stress measurements were monitored using a 32-channel acoustic emission monitoring system and a regional seismic monitoring network. Here, we present the results of the pre-investigations and stress measurements, and give an outlook for the hydro-shearing experiments planned for spring 2016.",

Recent evidence from marine sediment and terrestrial glaciovolcanic sequences suggests that the EAIS underwent periodic retreat and collapse in response to warmer climates during the late Neogene (14 to 3 million years ago).\nMummified prostrate trees recovered from palaeosols at Oliver Bluffs in the Beardmore Glacier region, Transantarctic Mountains (85° S), represent a rare insight into the terrestrial palaeoclimate during one of these periods of retreat. Prostrate trees are an understudied but useful tool for interrogating endmember (e.g. periglacial) environments at high altitudes and latitudes.\nWe present exciting new palaeoclimate data from the sequence at Oliver Bluffs. δ18O analysis of tree ring cellulose suggests that Antarctic summer palaeoprecipitation was enriched relative to today (-25 to -5‰ for ancient, -35 to -20‰ for modern); consistent with our isotope-enabled general circulation model simulations. The MBT/CBT palaeothermometer gives a summer temperature of 3-6ºC, consistent with other palaeobotanical climate indices.\nThese geological and model data have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of the hydrological cycle during this time period.

Scenarios that integrate qualitative storylines and quantitative biophysical models can create a vivid picture of these potential futures but the integration process is not straightforward. We present – using the Yahara Watershed in southern Wisconsin (USA) as a case study – a method for developing quantitative inputs (climate, land use/cover, and land management) to drive a biophysical modeling suite based on four provocative and contrasting narrative scenarios that describe plausible futures of the watershed to 2070. The modeling suite consists of an agroecosystem model (AgroIBIS-VSF), hydrologic routing model (THMB), and empirical lake water quality model and estimates several biophysical indicators to evaluate the watershed system under each scenario. These indicators include water supply, lake flooding, agricultural production, and lake water quality. Climate (daily precipitation and air temperature) for each scenario was determined using statistics from 210 different downscaled future climate projections for two 20-year time periods (2046-2065 and 2081-2100) and modified using a stochastic weather generator to allow flexibility for matching specific climate events within the scenario narratives. Land use/cover for each scenario was determined first by quantifying changes in areal extent every decade for 15 categories at the watershed scale to be consistent with the storyline events and theme. Next, these changes were spatially distributed using a rule-based framework based on land suitability metrics that determine transition probabilities. Finally, agricultural inputs including manure and fertilizer application rates were determined for each scenario based on the prevalence of livestock, water quality regulations, and technological innovations. Each scenario is compared using model inputs (maps and time-series of land use/cover and nutrient inputs, climate metrics) and outputs (maps and time-series of biophysical indicators).",

Despite this importance, large-scale models, used for climate projections, are not able to accurately represent MBL clouds and disagree on the magnitude of their feedback in a warming climate. Observations from the Marine Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) field campaign were used to investigate the relationships between thermodynamic structure and MBL cloud properties. MAGIC was the first ship-based deployment of the Second ARM Mobile facility (AMF2), making measurements from the Horizon Lines Spirit cargo ship as it traveled from Los Angeles, CA to Honolulu, HI and back from October 2012 through September 2013. Our analysis concentrates on observations from regular radiosonde launches from AMF, vertically pointing Ka-band ARM cloud radar observations and coincident scenes from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). MBL cloud mesoscale structure is quantified from satellite observations via the effective cloud diameter for a GCM-sized grid-box centered on the Spirit and related to boundary layer thermodynamic structure and cloud boundary statistics. Preliminary results suggest a bimodal relationship between lower tropospheric stability and MBL cloud mesoscale structure.",

            "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that large late Holocene temperature variations during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950-1250 CE) and Little Ice Age (LIA, 1450-1850 CE) were associated with changing climate patterns in North America (NA). However, significant questions remain regarding the timing, magnitude, spatial patterns, and mechanisms of MCA and LIA climate variability and its relationship to regional hydroclimate, particularly at multi-decadal and centennial timescales. To address these issues, we are synthesizing temperature and precipitation proxy data from continental North America and adjacent ocean regions. Challenges in this effort include: 1) the range of sensitivities of different proxy types to environmental variables, 2) difficulty in reconstructing accurate temperature and rainfall values from proxy data, and 3) a paucity of records, particularly in the central and northern portions of the continent, with adequate temporal resolution and timespan. Excluding some proxy types and records with multi-decadal or lower resolution significantly reduces spatial coverage. Our approach involves a broad selection of lithological, geochemical, and biological proxies from a wide range of environments, including several types of terrestrial sedimentary depositional settings, coastal marine sediments, ice cores, and speleothems, in an effort to capture the full range of temperature and hydroclimate variations.\nIn this presentation, we present preliminary results from over 200 records spanning the last 2000 years, a subset of a larger effort to synthesize climate records in NA during the entire Holocene. We identify continent-wide spatial climate patterns during the MCA and LIA, and we compare the differences between the MCA and LIA in our proxy-diverse synthesis to other paleodata-based syntheses and model simulations of these time periods.",

Structure from Motion photogrammetry offers a compelling vehicle for geomorphic change detection in fluvial environments. This process can produce arbitrarily high resolution, geographically registered spectral and topographic coverages from a collection of overlapping digital imagery from consumer cameras. Cuneo Creek has had three historically observed episodes of rapid aggradation (1955, 1964, and 1997). The debris flow deposits continue to be major sources of sediment sixty years after the initial slope failure. Previous studies have monitored the sediment storage volume and particle size since 1976 (in 1976, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1998, 2003). We reoccupied 3 previously surveyed stream cross sections on Sept 30, 2014 and March 30, 2015, and produced photogrammetric point clouds using a pole mounted camera with a remote view finder to take nadir view images from 4.3 meters above the channel bed. Ground control points were registered using survey grade GPS and typical cross sections used over 100 images to build the structure model. This process simultaneously collects channel geometry and we used it to also generate surface texture metrics, and produced DEMs with point cloud densities above 5000 points / m2. In the period between the surveys, a five year recurrence interval discharge of 20 m3/s scoured the channel. Surface particle size distribution has been determined for each observation period using image segmentation algorithms based on spectral distance and compactness. Topographic differencing between the point clouds shows substantial channel bed mobilization and reorganization. The net decline in sediment storage is in excess of 4 x 10^5 cubic meters since the 1964 aggradation peak, with associated coarsening of surface particle sizes. These new methods provide a promising rapid assessment tool for measurement of channel responses to sediment inputs.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this project is to make knowledge about regional climate modeling accessible to anyone in any location, regardless of their resources. We accomplish this through the development of a free online course, which introduces novice model users to an educational version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (e-WRF). These courses are grounded in education theory and have been described in detail at prior AGU meetings (Kelsey et al. 2014, Walton et al. 2014, Yarker & Mesquita 2013).\nResearch indicates that effective dialogue is an important component for successful learning to occur and displays the following elements: asking complex questions, deep discussion, and use of evidence to construct arguments (Benus et al. 2013). These can happen between the student and tutor, but peer-to-peer interaction is especially important as well as the most difficult aspect of social constructivism to meet, especially in an online setting. In our online courses, standard course forums were underutilized and generally only used to ask the tutor clarifying questions or troubleshoot error messages. To rectify this problem, we began using social media to facilitate conversation and notice vast improvement in peer-to-peer communication. Moreover, we created a community of over 700 regional climate modelers from around the world, sharing information, asking questions, and creating research projects relating to climate change.\nData was gathered by qualitatively analyzing forum and Facebook posts and quantitatively analyzing survey data from participants in both courses. Facebook participants posted on the group more often about a wider variety of topics than the forum participants. Additionally, there were statistically significant increase (‘student’ t test and Mann-Whitney test) in the elements of effective dialogue. We conclude that social media can serve as a possible tool in the development of online learning, especially for difficult concepts like regional climate modeling. Not only are participants more active on social media than forums, it can provide a community that supports participants; not only as they take the course, but after it is over and they are working on their own individual research projects as well.",

            "abstract": "Wintertime cold air outbreaks (CAOs) over the eastern United States (US) are often linked to the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and accompanied by enhanced northerly flow from Canada. However, this relationship is not one-to-one and the physical mechanism responsible for this upstream influence has not been previously determined. Here we perform a near-surface heat budget analysis in conjunction with piecewise potential vorticity inversions to identify the underlying physical mechanism. For the events of interest, several days prior to CAO onset, the NAO pattern intensifies and retrogresses westward from its canonical position. During this time, the NAO pattern induces lower-tropospheric easterly flow extending from the North Atlantic into Canada, leading to the formation of a prominent near-surface warm air anomaly over northeast Canada. The newly created warm air anomaly, in turn, induces enhanced northwesterly flow over the eastern US seaboard and, counterintuitively, contributes to the establishment of cold air anomalies and CAO onset over the eastern US. Thereafter, however, the Canadian warm air anomaly invades southeastern and central Canada, thereby eliminating the cold air within the original source region and effectively shutting off the CAO event. Thus, the lower-tropospheric warm anomaly over Canada serves to (a) physically connect the NAO to the US CAO events and (b) regulate the duration of the CAO event.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can cause rapid loss of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt by pitch angle scattering, especially for >2 MeV electrons. The rapid pitch angle scattering is limited to the low pitch angle electrons and cannot affect ~90 degree electrons. However, normal pitch angle distribution (PAD) of electron flux with peaks at 90 degree pitch angle is generally observed in the outer radiation belt. Magnetosonic (MS) waves in the outer radiation belt can scatter ~90 degree pitch angle electrons to lower pitch angles and lead to the formation of electron’s butterfly PAD. This paper studies the combined effect of EMIC waves and MS waves on the loss of the outer belt relativistic electrons during a minor storm on 16 November 2013 by combining Van Allen Probe measurements with test particle simulations. During the pre-storm period strong MS waves were observed by Probe A. Meanwhile normal PAD of 2.1 MeV electrons was measured by relativistic electron and proton telescope (REPT) on Probe A. When Probe B orbit was passing through the same area during the storm main phase, MS waves still existed but with weak intensity, while strong EMIC wave with ~1 nT amplitude were observed. Butterfly pitch angle distribution of 2.1 MeV electrons was seen to be formed at L = ~5-6. Four hours later, stronger EMIC waves were measured by Probe A and the fluxes of 2.1 MeV electrons at L=~5-6 showed great losses at all pitch angle sectors. The computed pitch angle diffusion rates show that the MS waves can produce the observed butterfly pitch angle distributions (flux peaks at 50-60 degree) for 2.1 MeV electrons. This indicates that ~90 degree pitch angle electrons are scattered to lower pitch angle by MS waves to form the butterfly PAD, and the observed strong EMIC waves then can resonate effectively with these butterfly distributed electrons and cause the electron loss in ~hours. Therefore, we suggest that although MS waves themselves cannot cause electron loss, they play a significant role by scattering ~90 degree pitch angle electrons to lower degrees, providing source particles to react with EMIC waves and then are lost from the outer radiation belt. Thus, by combining the effects of both MS waves and EMIC waves, we can explain not only the loss of the low pitch angle electrons, but also the loss of the electron core population.",

            "abstract": "The standard precipitation retrieval algorithm for the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core satellite of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is revised for version 04 (V04) and will be published in early 2016. In the current version (version 03; V03), as in the standard algorithm for the Precipitation Radar (PR) on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), relations between specific attenuation and effective radar reflectivity factor (k-Ze relations) are used to constrain the drop size distribution parameters. In V04, relations between rain rate and mass weighted mean diameter (R-Dm relations) are used instead of k-Ze relations. As both k and Ze are frequency dependent, in the DPR algorithm, k-Ze relations are prepared for KuPR (13.6GHz) and KaPR (35.5GHz). For KuPR, the same k-Ze relations with PR are used, but k-Ze relations were newly prepared for KaPR and they are not validated well. On the other hand, both R and Dm are frequency independent. R-Dm relations are calculated for PR as shown in Kozu et al. (2009), and they can be used both for KuPR and KaPR. Moreover, the same R-Dm relations are used at any height as long as “non-breakup and non-coalescence” is hold. We have measured (R, Dm) data by a disdrometer in Nagasaki, Japan and compared them with an R-Dm relation applied for stratiform rainfall (R=epsilon**4.6*0.401*Dm**6.131). As the average of epsilon is 0.97, in this comparison, it is suggested that R-Dm relation is not biased largely. Other measurement dataset under different precipitation climates should be used. Though R-Dm relations are dependent only on precipitation types in V04, we need to study the dependence of R-Dm relations on regions and seasons.",

            "abstract": "Brines rich in N2, H2, CH4 and He hosted within Precambrian crustal rocks are known to sustain microbial life [1]. The geological systems containing these brines have the potential to isolate organisms over planetary timescales and so can provide unique insight into the diversity and evolution of terrestrial life [1-3]. Long considered geological outliers, the prevalence of systems containing these ancient, deep fracture waters is only now being revealed. Recent studies demonstrate the Precambrian crust which accounts for ~70% of total crustal surface area has a global hydrogen production comparable to marine systems [2]. In addition to H2-producing reactions (e.g. radiolysis and serpentinization), a diversity of CH4-producing reactions also occur in these systems through both microbial and water-rock interactions [1, 2]. However, the role these Precambrian systems have in global hydrogen and carbon cycles is poorly understood. For this we need good constraints on the origins, residence times and degree of microbial activity of the fluids within these systems as well as the degree of interaction with external systems. Fortunately, noble gases are ideal for this role [1,3].\nPrevious noble gas analysis of N2, H2, CH4 and He-rich fluid samples collected at 2.4 km depth from a Cu-Zn mine in Timmins, Ontario, identified isolated fracture fluids with the oldest residence times ever observed (>1.1 Ga) [3]. This study has been significantly expanded now to fluids from an even greater depth (3 km) at Timmins, and from two new mines in the Sudbury Basin. Preliminary data from the deeper Timmins level indicate a new closed system with 136Xe/130Xe ratios 93% above modern air values (20% at 2.4 km) and an early atmosphere 124Xe/130Xe signal approaching the age of the host rock (~2.7 Ga) [4]. In comparison, the Sudbury system indicates exchange with an external source, being highly enriched in helium (30% gas volume) but with a low fissiogenic 136Xe/130Xe excess (10-38% above air). Through xenon and other noble gas data we present comparisons of mean fluid residence ages and fluid evolution for these closed and open systems.\n[1] Lippmann-Pipke et al. (2011) Chem.

            "abstract": "We present porewater methane and sulfate concentrations, and the isotope composition of carbon dioxide from 18 sites in areas of reported high methane water column concentrations on the Siberian shelf. Echosounder imaging and video imagery of the benthic environment were used to detect potential bubble emission from the sea bottom and to locate high methane emission areas. In areas where bubble flares were identified by acoustic echsounder imaging, recovered sediment cores provided evidence for slightly elevated porewater methane concentrations 10 cm below the sediment surface relative to sites without flares. Throughout the recovered sediment depth intervals porewater concentrations of methane were more than a factor 300 below the gas saturation limit at sea surface pressure. In addition, surface sediment video recordings provided no evidence for bubble emissions in the investigated methane hotspot areas although at nearby sites bubbles were detected higher in the water column. The conflicting observations of acoustic indications of rising bubbles and the absence of bubbles and methane oversaturation in any of the sediment cores during the whole SWERUS cruise suggest that advective methane seepage is a spatially limited phenomenon that is difficult to capture with routine ship-based core sampling methods in this field area.\nRecovery of a sediment core from one high-activity site indicated steep gradients in dissolved sulfate and methane in the first 8 cm of sediment pointing to the presence of anaerobic methane oxidation at a site with a high upward flux of methane. Based on the decrease of methane towards the sediment surface and the rates of sulfate reduction-coupled methane oxidation, most of the upward-transported methane was oxidized within the sediment. This conclusion is further supported by the stable isotope composition of dissolved carbon dioxide in porewaters and the precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals only found in sediment at this site. Overall, these results from the SWERUS expedition point to the well-described presence of sedimentary anaerobic microbial methane oxidation acting as a lid to prevent methane emission to the bottom waters of the Siberian shelf. Caution has to be exercised to apply these results in a wider spatial context for the Siberian shelf.",

            "abstract": "A new method is presented to objectively characterize and explore the differences in the space-time evolution of equatorial Pacific SSTAs observed during El Nino events. An application of this method to the 21 El Nino events during 1949-2013 captured two leading orthogonal modes, which explain more than 60% of the inter-event variance. The first mode distinguishes a strong and persistent El Nino from a weak and early-terminating El Niño. A similar analysis applied to the 22 La Nina events during 1949-2013 also revealed two leading orthogonal modes, with its first mode distinguishing a resurgent La Nina from a transitioning La Nina. This study shows that the four main phases of springtime El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) evolution (persistent versus early-terminating El Nino, and resurgent versus transitioning La Nina) are linked to distinctive spatial patterns of the probability of U.S. regional tornado outbreaks. In particular, the outbreak probability increases significantly up to 27% over the Ohio Valley, Upper Midwest and Southeast when a La Nina persists into the spring and is followed by another La Nina (i.e., resurgent La Nina). The probability also increases significantly up to 38%, but mainly in the South, when a two-year La Nina transitions to an El Nino (i.e., transitioning La Nna). These changes in outbreak probability are shown to be largely consistent with remotely forced regional changes in the large-scale tropospheric circulation, low-level vertical wind shear, moisture transports and extratropical storm activity.",

            "abstract": "Quaternary climate change between glacial-interglacial cycles is commonly thought to induce variations in catchment denudation rates. However, measurements of temporal variations in fluvial denudation are often lacking. Here we present an integration of existing and new cosmogenic nuclide measurements from European river terraces with the output from a (T159, ECHAM5) global atmospheric general circulation model of climate change during glacial and interglacial periods. Cosmogenic nuclide concentrations were measured from river terraces spanning 12 degrees of latitude in unglaciated, tectonically quiescent settings.\nResults from new cosmogenic nuclide measurements provide 9 new terrace ages (50 analyses). An additional 25 analyses provides catchment wide paleodenudation rates from terraces. From 0.5-2.0 Ma these data indicate low, and constant (11 +/- 5 mm/kyr) fluvial paleodenudation rates, regardless of the catchment latitude. Modern fluvial denudation rates increase to 20-50 mm/kyr. However, previous higher-fidelity studies of terraces formed since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) suggest a factor of 1.5-3 higher denudation rates during the LGM compared to modern. Results from paleoclimate simulations of the LGM, middle Holocene, and modern suggest precipitation rates were 100-500 mm/yr drier than the modern across Europe during glacial periods. Mid-Holocene precipitation rates were ~100 mm/yr drier (SW Europe) to ~200 mm/yr wetter (central Europe) than modern. Predicted LGM temperatures indicate periglacial conditions in some areas. Thus, despite moderate changes in predicted precipitation between glacial and interglacial cycles, there is no clear signal of these cycles in cosmogenic-derived denudation rates between 0.5-2 Ma. In contrast, catchments with higher-fidelity records since the LGM document higher denudation rates during glacial times. We suggest this difference is driven by periglacial, not fluvial, processes. These results have two implications. (1) Variations in temperature and periglacial processes, rather than precipitation modulate catchment denudation rates over glacial interglacial cycles, and (2) The integration time scale of, and uncertainties in, paleodenudation rates between 0.5-2 Ma mask any glacial-interglacial variations in denudation.",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~55.5 Ma) is recognized globally in marine sediments by a carbonate dissolution zone, the extinction or turnover of benthic taxa, and a radiation of planktic excursion taxa, all accompanied by a rapid-onset, negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE). The cause and nature of the massive carbon release leading to this extreme climate event remains under debate. Regardless of cause, the environmental and ecosystem changes centered on the PETM are the subject of much study because they provide an analog to modern deteriorating conditions associated with the ongoing rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nWe present evidence from sediments of the South Dover Bridge core, deposited on the U.S. mid-Atlantic shelf, for an ocean acidification event in the latest Paleocene that coincides with a relatively small (-2‰) negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) that precedes the larger (-4‰) Paleocene-Eocene CIE onset. Planktic foraminifers during this pre-onset event (POE) show post-deposition dissolution in which the coarsely cancellate and muricate wall textures characteristic of many Late Paleocene species have been dissolved away, leaving smooth, thin-walled specimens often with collapsed chambers. In addition, we document biotic responses in benthic, planktic, and terrestrial communities to the POE, including shifts in foraminifer and pollen assemblages and adaptations in calcareous nannofossil species in response to environmental perturbations.\nA complete recovery is evident between the POE and CIE in both the carbon isotopic signal and in the biotic response, providing additional evidence not only for a pulsed carbon release, but also for a more rapid rate of carbon release than is suggested by a single pulse over a longer period of time. The timing, nature and magnitude of ecological changes during the less extreme POE shallow water acidification event may help to define the ecological tipping point of shallow marine ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "One of the indicators of a warming Arctic region is an intensification of the hydrological cycle, with increasing permafrost and glacial melt and possibly more precipitation resulting in higher river runoff. Indeed, a significant increase of nearly 10% in annual river flux has been observed in 13 major rivers throughout the entire Arctic region over the last 30 years. However, direct measurements are extremely sparse for 100’s of smaller-scale tundra river systems, as well as for proglacial rivers around the Greenland Ice Sheet margin. Observations at in-situ gauging stations are hampered by seasonal ice coverage, break-up and freeze-up dynamics, unstable banks, and difficult access. To overcome such difficulties, we develop remote-sensing based river discharge measurement techniques using a variety of satellite sensors, including reflectance in the near-infrared band of MODIS, LANDSAT, and brightness temperature from the passive microwave sensors AMSR-E and AMSR-2. We use varying inundation of the river channel and floodplain throughout a season to quantify the changing Arctic river flux. A new approach to detect river ice break up in spring has been developed, and is now undergoing validation. To calibrate the remote sensing signal to daily river discharge, we employ either in-situ short observation records, or a numerical distributed hydrological model driven by daily reanalysis climate data. Quantitative reconstructions of meltwater fluxes in rivers along the Greenland Ice Sheet margin obtained so far show a dampened response of these rivers to Greenland Ice Sheet melt. Techniques are now deployed to map river dynamics along the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea coasts, and show shifts in break-up dynamics and flooding patterns. Once calibrated, satellite-based reconstructions have the potential to lengthen short observational records to a ~15 year timespan.",

            "abstract": "Mountaintop removal coal mining (MTM) in the Central Appalachians has expanded over the last 40 years to cover ~7% of this mountainous landscape. MTM operations remove mountaintops and ridges with explosives and machinery to access underlying coal seams. Much of this crushed rock overburden is subsequently deposited into nearby valleys, creating valley fills that often bury headwater streams. In contrast to other disturbances such as forest clear-cutting, perturbations from MTM can extend hundreds of meters deep into the critical zone and completely reshape landscapes. Despite the expansiveness and intensity of the disturbance, MTM has only recently begun to receive focused attention from the hydrologic community and the effect of MTM on the hydrology of impacted watersheds is still not well understood. We are using a two-pronged approach consisting of GIS analysis to quantify spoil volumes and landscape change, together with empirical analysis and modeling of rainfall and runoff data collected in two sets of paired watersheds. We seek to investigate how MTM affects basic hydrologic metrics, including storm peakflows, runoff response times, baseflow, statistics of flow duration curves, and longer-term water balances. Each pair consists of a mined and an unmined watershed; the first set contains headwater streams (size ~100ha), the second set consists of 3rd order streams, draining ~3500ha. Mining covers ~ 95% of the headwater watershed, and 40% of the 3rd-order watershed. Initial GIS analysis indicates that the overburden moved during the mining process could be up to three times greater than previously estimated. Storm runoff peaks in the mined watersheds were muted as compared to the unmined watersheds and runoff ratios were reduced by up to 75% during both wet and dry antecedent conditions. The natural reference watersheds were highly responsive while the additional storage in the mined watersheds led to decreased peak flows during storms and enhanced baseflow during dry periods.",

            "abstract": "The proportion of carbon (C) allocated to tree stems is an important determinant of the C sink-strength of global forest ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms controlling stem growth is essential for parameterization of global vegetation models and to accurately predict C sequestration of forest ecosystems. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of intra-annual variations in stem growth of tropical forest ecosystems, which could be especially prone to projected climatic changes. We here present high-resolution data (≤ 6 µm; ≥ 1 min) from a novel monitoring network of wireless devices for automated measurement of expansion and contraction in tree diameter using a membrane potentiometer, as well as point dendrometers on phloem and xylem to analyze diurnal changes in stem growth. Our results indicate that diurnal changes in stem diameter were associated with sap flow and related to seasonal variations in daytime temperature and water availability, such that daily maximum stem growth was positively related to temperature during the wet season but showed the opposite trend during the onset of the dry season. We show that high-resolution monitoring of stem growth of tropical trees is crucial to determine the response to intra-annual climate variation and therefore will be key to accurately predict future responses of tropical aboveground C storage, and should be of special interest for tropical ecosystem research and earth system science.",

            "abstract": "U/Ca ratios were measured in a subset (n ≈ 30) of well preserved scleractinian fossil corals previously described by Gothmann et al. (2015) in order to investigate Cenozoic changes in seawater [U]. He/U dating studies and measurements of 234U/238U and δ238/235U provide constraints on fossil coral U preservation. He/U ages also demonstrate the ability of well preserved coral aragonite to retain most of its radiogenic He over million year timescales.\nWe find that fossil coral U/Ca has increased by a factor of ~4 between the Early Cenozoic and today. This number is calculated from the change in seawater [Ca2+] implied by brine inclusions and other proxies, and the assumption that the U/Ca in shallow water corals equals the seawater ratio. The change cannot be attributed to a dependence of coral U uptake on seawater pH or [CO32-] (e.g., Inoue et al., 2011), which would lead to a decrease in U/Ca going forward in time. Instead, we suggest that seawater [U] has increased since the Early Cenozoic. Possible explanations for the inferred change include: (1) a small decrease in uranium uptake in suboxic and anoxic sediments over the Cenozoic, (2) a decrease in the rate of low-temperature hydrothermal alteration, and associated U uptake, over the Cenozoic, and (3) a decrease in U removal from seawater resulting from an increase in UO2-CO3 complexation, as originally suggested by Broecker (1971).\n",

            "abstract": "Orbital timescale East Asian monsoonal intensity throughout the Holocene shows a first order decreasing trend in the subtropical southeastern Asian sector. This long-term trend is also extended to a variety of paleoclimate records from various regions of the globe. But, the shorter-term paleoclimatic episodes such as millennial-timescale events are in a much debate for their regional presences and periodities. Here we report a stalagmite δ18O record from Baek-ryong Cave in the central Korean Peninsula that shows the changes in East Asian monsoon intensity since the last 5,000 years. The general pattern of the stalagmite δ18O record can be divided into 3 orders changes. Most long-term variation in the δ18O record is orbital scale increasing trend from the bottom to the top of the stalagmite sample with about 0.8 ‰ differences between maximum and minimum δ18O values. Middle-term variations are most apparent and show about 1,000 years-scale quasi-cyclic variations with about 0.6~1.0 ‰ changes, and lastly, short-term variations are multi-decadal scale fluctuations with about 0.20 ‰ changes. The middle-term cyclic variations are very obvious based on the separation from the range of standard deviation. The variations also display a similarity with many of stalagmite δ18O records from subtropical Chinese regions in their overall trends and prominent millennial-scale cold/dry events since mid-Holocene. These results indicate that the δ18O record was controlled mainly by the changes in East Asian monsoon intensity possibly with minor contribution of atmospheric temperature effect. We interpreted that these millennial-scale variations in East Asian monsoon have been affected by changes in solar forcing and North Atlantic overturning circulations. Also, we suggest that 1,000 years quasi-cyclic dry events were at least regional episodes since the mid-Holocene.  ",

We demonstrate the usability of the ECMWF-SEPS and discuss the challenges and areas of opportunities when issuing forecasts generated with this methodology.\nA simple bias-correction and downscaling technique, namely linear scaling, is applied to the raw inputs to remove the bias intrinsic in ensemble prediction systems and to downscale the data to a scale appropriate for hydrological modelling. The forecasts of the meteorological variables are analysed for accuracy and reliability by comparing them to meteorological observations. Additionally, weather ensembles will be generated using the nearest-neighbour resampling technique with the purpose of exploring additional possibilities of hydrometeorological system input for complementing situations where the SEPS is lacking skill.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that submesoscale processes greatly influence the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer. These processes have a substantial impact, in particular, on the transport of momentum, buoyancy, and passive tracers such as carbonate chemical species, nutrients, and plankton. It has been suggested that the vertical transfer of both active buoyancy and passive tracers can be described by the same vertical flux profile, thus permitting the use of one flux profile when parameterizing the effects of submoescale processes on tracer transport. Within the submesoscale range, however, both partly geostrophic fronts and eddies, which act to restratify the mixed layer, and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence, which acts to enhance vertical mixing, are simultaneously active, thus giving rise to complex multiscale interactions between turbulence and tracer dynamics. In this talk, large eddy simulations spanning the range of scales from 20km down to 5m are used to examine the role of multiscale turbulent mixing on both an active buoyancy tracer and several nonreactive passive ocean tracers from interior and sea-surface sources. The simulations include the effects of both small-scale wave-driven Langmuir turbulence and larger submesoscale eddies. Tracer properties are characterized using spatial fields and statistics, multiscale fluxes, and spectra. Results show that while submesoscale eddies transport buoyancy upward to extract potential energy, the same is not true of passive tracers. Instead, the suppression of turbulent vertical mixing in active submesoscale regions leads to suppressed entrainment of tracers, implying weaker transport by submesoscale activity. These results along with implications for the development of reduced order tracer models will be discussed.",

Strong gravity wave (GW) activity occurred in sporadic intervals lasting a few days. Large-amplitude mountain waves were detected during periods with high tropospheric wind speeds perpendicular to the Southern Alps. During the strongest event (29 July to 1 August) mountain wave amplitudes in excess of 15 K occurred at 40 km altitude, resulting in GW potential energy density enhancements exceeding one order of magnitude. The quasi-stationary large-amplitude waves often break and dissipate in the stratosphere and do not reach mesospheric altitudes. Secondary GWs radiated in this process account for a significant shift in the wave spectrum toward smaller scales. In addition, a substantial number of small-scale secondary GWs are generated as a result of propagating primary GWs interacting with tides. In the mesosphere, largest mountain wave amplitudes occur during conditions of weak to moderate tropospheric forcing (wind speeds in the range 2-12 m/s) and sufficiently strong stratospheric wind speeds (> 10 m/s) to allow vertical propagation.",

The ESDIS DOI registration system has registered over 2000 DOIs with over 1000 DOIs held in reserve until all required information has been collected. By working towards the goal of assigning DOIs to the 8000+ data collections under its management, ESDIS has taken the first step towards facilitating the use of data citations with those products.\nWhen registering DOIs, ESDIS requires certain DOI elements be collected for the DOI landing page as recommended by NASA’s Earth Science Data System Working Group (ESDSWG). The landing page provides sufficient information to 1) identify NASA data as referenced in a science publication, 2) credit data creators and distributors, and 3) access the data itself enabling the trace-ability and reproducibility of the data. However, the required elements for this DOI landing page are also the core required elements for forming an Earth science data citation.\nData citations are getting significant attention from the scientific community and data centers alike. So to encourage the citing of Earth science data products, each product DOI landing page displays a sample data citation and makes the required citation elements available to DataCite for use in its Data Citation generation tool. This paper will describe that process.\nESDIS data centers are constantly developing technologies to better serve the Earth science user community such as Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure (GIOVANNI), Land and Atmospheric Near Real-Time Capability for EOS (LANCE), and advanced tools that support virtual data collections, and virtual data products. These all provide easier access to data and make possible the creation of data products with user specified parameters. However, assigning digital identifiers to such products present a unique challenge to ESDIS. This paper will also discuss possible approaches for assigning DOIs to products produced by these special tools and services.",

One is cold surges with an amplification of the Siberian High originating from the upper-tropospheric propagation of the wave-train from northwestern Eurasia into East Asia - wave-train type. The other is cold surges with an amplification of Siberian High induced by atmospheric blocking, which is caused by retrograded High anomalies from the North pacific into Siberia - blocking type. In this study, indices for identifying the two types of cold surges using 300 hPa geopotential height were developed and distinct large-scale upper-tropospheric circulation, Siberian High, and temperature anomalies associated with the two types of cold surges were investigated. It is newly suggest that the blocking type cold surges persist 2 to 3 days longer than wave-train type cold surges with stronger negative temperature anomalies. The predictability of the two types of cold surges were investigated from hindcast dataset of NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS). The blocking-type cold surges are found to be more predictable compared to the wave-train type cold surges.

            "abstract": "Karst topography has been well recognized to include high velocity, turbulent subterranean fluid pathways that are strongly coupled by fractures and openings to surface streams where water and sediment is exchanged. Recent research has focused on the fate and transport of organic carbon in surface dominated fluvial systems, but we find that little knowledge has been reported with regards to the transport and fate of terrestrially-derived sediment organic carbon within karst subterranean pathways. This study investigates the hypothesis that karst pathways could act as biologically active conveyors of sediment organic carbon that temporarily store sediment, turnover carbon at higher rates than would be considered otherwise, and recharge relatively depleted sediment organic carbon back to the surface stream within the fluvial system. Mixed research methods are applied within a mature karst network in the Bluegrass Region, Kentucky, USA, and methods included high resolution measurements of water and sediment characteristics for surface streams, carbon and stable carbon isotope measurements of transported sediment, and numerical modeling of water and sediment pathways. A modeling framework coupling physical and biogeochemcial processes of transport and decomposition is developed for use in mature fluviokarst watersheds. Results of this study show that phreatic nature of karst conduits results in the subsurface deposition of labile, storm-injected sediment which is subsequently decomposed by heterotrophic bacteria. Results of this study show a 40% depletion of organic content that corresponds with the depletion and outgassing of 0.06 metric tCkm-2yr-1 of organic carbon delivered to the subsurface conduit. This result is in contrast to surfacewater dominated streams in the Bluegrass Region for which research has shown that organic carbon can undergo a 50% enrichment from the time it enters the stream until the time it exits.",

            "abstract": "A cloud-resolving model (CRM) is an atmospheric numerical model that can numerically resolve clouds and cloud systems at 0.25~5km horizontal grid spacings. The main advantage of the CRM is that it can allow explicit interactive processes between microphysics, radiation, turbulence, surface, and aerosols without subgrid cloud fraction, overlapping and convective parameterization. Because of their fine resolution and complex physical processes, it is challenging for the CRM community to i) visualize/inter-compare CRM simulations, ii) diagnose key processes for cloud-precipitation formation and intensity, and iii) evaluate against NASA’s field campaign data and L1/L2 satellite data products due to large data volume (~10TB) and complexity of CRM’s physical processes.\nWe have been building the Super Cloud Library (SCL) upon a Hadoop framework, capable of CRM database management, distribution, visualization, subsetting, and evaluation in a scalable way. The current SCL capability includes (1) A SCL data model enables various CRM simulation outputs in NetCDF, including the NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) and Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model, to be accessed and processed by Hadoop, (2) A parallel NetCDF-to-CSV converter supports NU-WRF and GCE model outputs, (3) A technique visualizes Hadoop-resident data with IDL, (4) A technique subsets Hadoop-resident data, compliant to the SCL data model, with HIVE or Impala via HUE’s Web interface, (5) A prototype enables a Hadoop MapReduce application to dynamically access and process data residing in a parallel file system, PVFS2 or CephFS, where high performance computing (HPC) simulation outputs such as NU-WRF’s and GCE’s are located. We are testing Apache Spark to speed up SCL data processing and analysis.\nWith the SCL capabilities, SCL users can conduct large-domain on-demand tasks without downloading voluminous CRM datasets and various observations from NASA Field Campaigns and Satellite data to a local computer, and inter-compare CRM output and data with GCE and NU-WRF.",

Also, the structure of the jets vary between the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean Basins. Seasonal progression also has an impact on the structure and shape of the polar and subtropical jets. During the Winter in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, a more diffuse jet structure occurs during La Nina while a more focused jet structure is favored in El Niño periods.

            "abstract": "The current era of satellite remote sensing has provided unprecedented opportunities for monitoring the terrestrial hydrologic cycle. In the present study, we evaluated three global satellite precipitation products (TRMM 3B42 V7, 3B42 RT and CMORPH) during 2003-2012 for multi-scale hydrologic applications, including annual water budgeting, monthly and daily streamflow simulation, and extreme floods modeling, via a distributed hydrological model (GBHM) in the Yangtze River basin. This regional evaluation is first performed at temporal scales ranging from annual to daily via comparisons with ground precipitation observations in order to understand the error characteristics associated with the satellite precipitation products. Then the work focuses on evaluation of the hydrologic simulations forced with the three products. The results show 3B42 V7 data generally has a better performance in annual water budgeting and monthly streamflow simulation, but this superiority is not guaranteed for daily simulation, especially for floods monitoring. It is also found that, for annual water budgeting, the positive (negative) bias of 3B42 RT (CMORPH) estimates have been mainly propagated into the simulated runoff, while the simulated evapotranspiration tends to be more sensitive to negative bias. Regarding streamflow simulation, both near-real-time products show region-dependent bias: 3B42 RT tends to overestimate streamflow in the upper Yangtze River; in contrast, CMORPH shows serious underestimation in those downstream sub-basins. Screened at 394 selected flood events, the results indicate that 3B42 RT and CMORPH have competitive performances for near real-time floods monitoring in the upper Yangtze, but for those downstream sub-basins, 3B42 RT outperforms CMORPH. Furthermore, the inability of all satellite products to capture some key features of the 2012 July extreme floods reveals the deficiencies associated with them, which will limit their hydrologic utility in floods monitoring. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential usages of latest satellite precipitation products for hydrological applications in the Yangtze River, and further promotes better utilization of future GPM-era data in operational predictions.",

            "abstract": "The North American Monsoon (NAM) season, which encompasses the months of July through September, is associated with an increase in severe weather throughout much of the southwest Contiguous US (CONUS). Transient inverted troughs (IVs) are upper tropospheric disturbances that result in both synoptic scale and mesoscale enhancement of convection in the NAM region. Thus IVs often result in organized convection, which takes the form of squall lines and mesoscale convective systems. Organized convection during the NAM results in severe weather hazards, including severe straight line winds, blowing dust, and flash flooding. Previous work has suggested that long-term changes in IV climatology are dependent on strengthening of the monsoon ridge, a semiperminant anticyclone that is climatologically centered over the southwest CONUS during the NAM season. This previous work considered IV trends from WRF dynamically downscaled NCEP/NCAR reanalysis I from 1951 to 2010. Using the same objective tracking methodology, where IVs are located and tracked as 250 hPa potential vorticity anomalies, long-term trends in IV track density climatology are analyzed from four dynamically downscaled GCMs. The impacts of these changes in IV track density climatology are considered through further dynamical downscaling of the WRF simulations to the convection resolving scale. The long-term precipitation trends from days with favorable thermodynamic regimes for organized convection are considered through these high-resolution simulations. We consider the consistency of the dynamically downscaled GCMs at reproducing the NAM ridge and the IV track density climatology during overlapping time periods from the reanalysis (1981-2010). The performance of these downscaled GCM solutions is highly dependent upon the ability of the forcing GCM to realistically simulate the climatology and position of the monsoon ridge. These findings are used to discern the relative roles of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on IV climatology and subsequent effects on monsoon season precipitation in the southwest CONUS.",

            "abstract": "Leaf scattering spectrum is the only optical variable that conveys information about leaf biochemistry. It cannot be directly measured from space because the radiation measured by the sensor is affected by the canopy structure and the atmosphere. Multiangle remote sensing data provide information critical to account for such effects, including structural contributions to measurements of leaf optics. Some radiation is scattered at the surface of leaves, which contains no information on the leaf interior. This represents an additional confounding factor, unless it can be accounted for. Polarization measurements are useful to quantify leaf surface characteristics because radiation scattered at the surface of leaves is partly polarized whereas that from the leaf interior is not. This poster presents analyses of surface reflectance data from Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) and the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Our results indicate that 1) sensitivity of spectral reflectance corrected for canopy structure effects to foliar nitrogen (N) content is negatively related to the leaf degree of linear polarization (DOLP); 2) polarized canopy BRF (pBRF) in oblique directions can account up to 52% of reflected radiation; 3) pBRF varies with species, suggesting that leaf surface properties cannot be neglected when interpreting BRF; 4) canopy reflects radiation specularly in all directions. In general our results suggest that hyperspectral, multiangle and polarimetric data are required to monitor leaf biochemistry from space.",

            "abstract": "Magma-crustal carbonate interaction and subsequent decarbonation can provide an additional source of CO2 release to the exogenic system superimposed on mantle-derived CO2. Carbonate assimilation at present day volcanoes is often modeled by limestone consumption experiments [1-4]. Eruptive products, however, do not clearly display the characteristic ultracalcic melt compositions produced during limestone-magma interaction [4]. Yet estimated CO2outflux [5] and composition of volcanics in many volcanic systems may allow ~3-17% limestone- or dolostone-assimilated melt contribution. Crystallization may retain ultracalcic melts in pyroxenite cumulates.\nTo extend our completed study on limestone assimilation, here we explore the effect of varying composition from calcite to dolomite on chemical and thermal decarbonation efficiency of crustal carbonates. Piston cylinder experiments at 0.5 GPa and 900-1200 °C demonstrate that residual mineralogy during interaction with magma shifts from CaTs cpx and anorthite/scapolite in the presence of calcite to Di cpx and Fo-rich olivine with dolomite. Silica-undersaturated melts double in magnesium content, while maintaining high (>30 wt.%) CaO values. At high-T, partial thermal breakdown of dolomite into periclase and CO2 is minimal (<5%) suggesting that in the presence of magma, CO2 is primarily released due to assimilation. Assimilated melts at identical P-T conditions depict similarly high volatile contents (10-20 wt.% by EMPA deficit at 0.5 GPa, 1150 °C with hydrous basalt) with calcite or dolomite. Analysis of the coexisting fluid phase indicates the majority of water is dissolved in the melt, while CO2 released from the carbonate is preferentially partitioned into the vapor. This suggests that although assimilated melts have a higher CO2 solubility, most of the CO2can easily degas from the vapor phase at arc volcanoes, possibly more so at volcanic plumbing systems traversing dolomite [8].\n[1]Conte et al 2009 EuJMin (21) 763-782; [2]Iacono-Marziano et al 2008 CMP (155) 719-738; [3]Mollo et al 2010 Lithos (114) 503-514; [4]Carter and Dasgupta 2015 EPSL (427) 202-214; [5]Burton et al 2013 RevMinGeochem (75) 323-254; [6]Balassone et al 2013 Lithos (160-161) 84-97; [7]Di Rocco et al. 2012 JPet (53) 2307-2332; [8]Del Moro et al 2001 JVGR (112) 15-24.",

This fabric is defined by a diverse set of observations, including (1) a magnetic lineament extending from offshore Prince Patrick Island to the bend in the Canada Basin Gravity Low that separates higher magnetic amplitudes to the northwest from a region of more subdued anomalies to the southeast; (2) the orientation of the 600-km long Northwind Escarpment along the edge of the Canada Basin; (3) a large, linear, positive magnetic anomaly that parallels Northwind Escarpment; (4) negative flower structures along the base of the Northwind Escarpment identified in seismic reflection profiles; (5) the edges of a linear, 150-km-long by 20-km-wide by 2000-m deep, basin in the Chukchi Plateau; (6) the sub-parallel ridges of Sever Spur along the Canadian margin north of Prince Patrick Island; (7) an oblong gravity low interpreted to indicate thick sediments beneath an inferred rift basin at 78oN in ~3600 m water depth; (8) the offshore extensions of the Canning sinistral and Richardson dextral fault zones; (9) the offshore extension of the D3 magnetic terrain of Saltus et al. (2011); and (10) the association of dredged rocks of the Chukchi Borderland with the Pearya terrane ~2000 km northeast of its present location (Brumley et al., 2015). Ongoing deformation of the Beaufort margin by impingement of the Brooks Range tectonic front is recorded by modern seismicity along the Canning and Richardson fault zones, which imply that deformation is accommodated by slip along the northeast-trending fabric. Together, these features are interpreted to indicate long-lived northeast-southwest oriented tectonic fabric in the development of the Canada Basin from initial rifting to modern deformation of the Beaufort margin. The approximately east-west trending seafloor-spreading of the central Canada Basin appears to be enclosed by and not affected by this fabric. This synthesis, although speculative, suggests that the opening of the Canada Basin may have involved considerable wrench faulting in addition to the more generally accepted rotational model of opening.

AMSR2 is designed as a follow-on from the successful Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – EOS that ceased formal operations in 2011. The standard SD product for AMSR2 has been updated in two ways. First, the detection algorithm identifies various observable geophysical targets that can confound SD / SWE estimation (water bodies [including freeze/thaw state], rainfall, high altitude plateau regions [e.g. Tibetan plateau]) before detecting moderate and shallow snow. Second, the implementation of the Dense Media Radiative Transfer model (DMRT) originally developed by Tsang et al. (2000) and more recently adapted by Picard et al. (2011) is used to estimate SWE and SD. The implementation combines snow grain size and density parameterizations originally developed by Kelly et al. (2003). Snow grain size is estimated from the tracking of estimated air temperatures that are used to drive an empirical grain growth model. Snow density is estimated from the Sturm et al. (2010) scheme. Efforts have been made to keep the approach tractable while reducing uncertainty in these input variables. Results are presented from the recent winter seasons since 2012 to illustrate the performance of the new approach in comparison with the initial AMSR2 algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal experiments were performed at 410, 420 and 450°C between 180-450 bar to investigate anhydrite (CaSO4) solubility and Ca isotope fractionation in the liquid-vapor stability field of the NaCl-H2O system. Experiments were conducted in flexible gold reaction cells and a fixed volume Ti reactor to reach all pressures between the critical curve and three-phase boundary. During isothermal decompression at 410°C, anhydrite solubility in the liquid phase increases (1 to 9 mmol/kg Ca), whereas the solubility decreases in the vapor phase (130 to < 10 umol/kg Ca). At 410°C and 290-270 bar, the partition coefficient, log Km = log (mv / ml), for Ca decreases from -1.35 to -2.46, and that of SO4 decreases from -1.76 to -2.82. At 420°C the Ca:SO4 ratio of the starting solution was 2:1, and the pH25°C decreases in the liquid and increases in the vapor upon decompression. Ca hydrolysis in the liquid and complex interactions between undetermined aqueous species in the vapor could explain this pattern. At 410 and 450°C, the experiments started with a Ca:SO4 ratio of 1:1. Along the 410°C isotherm, pH25°C initially increases in both the liquid and vapor, potentially caused by precipitation of an H+ bearing salt, such as NaHSO4. 30-40 bar below the critical curve there is a sudden decrease in pH25°C as the putative salt phase may become unstable and dissolve. At 450°C, pH25°C decreases in the vapor and increases in the liquid, as HCl and H2SO4 partition into the vapor. Ca isotope data at 420°C between 375-300 bar indicate that the vapor is isotopically light relative to the liquid. At lower pressures both phases approach the isotopic composition of the coexisting anhydrite, suggesting that dissolved Ca speciation becomes more structurally similar to anhydrite. This study furthers our understanding of elemental partitioning and isotopic fractionation in mineral-fluid systems with implications for mass transfer reactions at/near the magma-hydrothermal boundary at mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "Measuring atmospheric oxidants is central to the development of an improved understanding of tropospheric chemistry. The hydroxyl radical (OH) and the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) are two important atmospheric oxidants that are present in only trace amounts, and yet these radicals are responsible for a significant fraction of daytime tropospheric oxidation. Atmospheric detection of OH and HO2 is often accomplished using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) as part of the Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE) technique. The OH radical is detected directly using 308 nanometer laser light, and the HO2 radical is detected through reaction with NO to produce OH. The LIF-FAGE instruments, the Ground Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS) and the Airborne Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (ATHOS), developed by our group at the Pennsylvania State University, have been operated in laboratory experiments and field campaigns for more than two decades. Recent discoveries of chemical interferences in LIF-FAGE instruments have highlighted the need for accurate, updated calibrations for each instrument in order to standardize measurements of OH and HO2. In this presentation, we will investigate the extent to which certain chemical species frequently found in forest air may interfere with the measurement of OH and HO2 for GTHOS/ATHOS. We will discuss the results from laboratory studies involving interferences found for OH and for HO2, including the recent suggestion that NO3 can cause interference for FAGE-type HOx measurements. Our results may contribute to the improvement of inter-instrument agreement and reproducibility of complex diurnal forest data sets.",

Major challenges remain, namely the completion of the network where most of the remaining stations have either environmental, logistical and/or political issues to surmont (89% of the stations have already been built) and the sustainment of a reliable and state-of the-art network covering 4 technologies - seismic, infrasound , hydroacoustic and radionuclide. To have a credible and trustworthy verification system ready for entry into force of the Treaty, the CTBTO is protecting and enhancing its investment of its global network of stations and is providing effective data to the International Data Centre (IDC) and Member States. Regarding the protection of the CTBTO’s investment and enhanced sustainment of IMS station operations, the IMS Division is enhancing the capabilities of the monitoring system by applying advances in instrumentation and introducing new software applications that are fit for purpose. Some examples are the development of noble gas laboratory systems to process and analyse subsoil samples, development of a mobile noble gas system for onsite inspection purposes, optimization of Beta Gamma detectors for Xenon detection, assessing and improving the efficiency of wind noise reduction systems for infrasound stations, development and testing of infrasound stations with a self-calibrating capability, and research into the use of modular designs for the hydroacoustic network.",

Here we report on early results from the Energetic Ion Spectrometer (EIS) instrument on each of the MMS Spacecraft. EIS provides nearly all-sky energetic ion energy, angle and elemental compositional distributions for < 20 keV for protons and 45 keV for oxygen ions, up to > 1 MeV. It also measures energetic electrons from 25 keV to > 0.5 MeV in support and coordination with the electron-focused Fly’s Eye Energetic Particle Spectrometer (FEEPS). During the early phase of the MMS mission, while the full complement of instruments was being commissioned prior to the prime mission phase beginning 1 September 2015, EIS observed dynamic energetic particle injections at the root of the magnetotail between the post-midnight regions and dawn in association with numerous dipolarization fronts and related processes. Here we report on coordinated measurements between MMS’s EIS instrument and EIS’s sister instrument on the Van Allen Probes, RBSPICE, to further address the relationship between dynamic injections and depolarization fronts in the magnetotail and injections observed deep within the magnetosphere’s ring current regions. We also report preliminary result on using energetic particle gradients and anistotropies to diagnose magnetopause structures near mission-identified reconnection sites.",

            "abstract": "We study the large solar energetic particle (SEP) events that were detected by GOES in the > 10 MeV energy channel during December 2006 to March 2014. Using multi-spacecraft observations from STEREO A, B and SOHO, we are able to determine accurately the solar particle release (SPR) time of SEP electrons and protons. We first compute connection angles (CA) between the solar events and magnetic foot-points connecting to each spacecraft. By choosing the smallest CA, we derive the electron and proton SPRs using electron fluxes from the SOHO Electron Proton and Helium Instrument (EPHIN), proton fluxes from the SOHO Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron instrument (ERNE), and from the High Energy Telescope (HET) on STEREO. It is found that: 1) the 0.25 MeV-0.7 MeV electron SPRs are ~10 min earlier than 2.64 MeV - 10.4 Mev electron SPRs; 2) the proton SPRs inferred from high-energy channels (> 50 MeV) are similar to electron SPRs; 3) the proton SPRs inferred from lower energy channel (10 - 16.9 MeV) can be either ~ 7 min earlier than or delayed from the electron SPRs for tens of minutes to hours, especially for SEPs with large pre-event background flux levels. In this study, we evaluated the effects of large scattering and high background levels on SPRs and made suggested corrections for the background effect on SPR times. We also find that for some large SEP events, the observed EPHIN electron and ERNE proton intensity profiles show a double-peak feature. The onset of the first peak corresponds well to the associated Type III and metric Type II onset and tends to be nearly scattering-free.",

Using hurricane best track data from JTWC and TPC we investigate the decadal variations of TC activities. Our research indicates that the variability of TC frequency of different ocean basins (North Indian Ocean (NIO), Northwest Pacific Ocean (WP), Northeast Pacific Ocean (NEP), North Atlantic Ocean (NA) and South Hemisphere (SH)) all have significant decadal periods, and these decadal signals have something connect with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which acting as the background, modulating and influencing the synoptic scale weather systems. Through diagnosing the oceanic and atmospheric circulation in different stages of PDO, we find that, as the PDO signal transmits through the Pacific Ocean, the atmospheric circulation changes accordingly all over the tropical ocean. And they influence the dynamic conditions in the troposphere and promote or restrain the tropical cyclone activities in these areas. In another word, in the positive phase of PDO, there are much more (less) TC activities observed over the NEP (NA, WP, NIO, SH), which very likely due to the favorable (unfavorable) environmental factors, such as higher (lower) SST, weaker (stronger) vertical wind shear, higher (lower) relative humidity in the middle level of troposphere, and low level positive (negative) vorticity in the local area. Meanwhile, what should be noted is that the primary environmental factor could be very different in different ocean basin.\nKeywords: tropical cyclone, decadal variability, PDO",

            "abstract": "The event of 1604 Quanzhou earthquake induced a moderate tsunami with no significant damage report. However, the tsunami propagated over the Taiwan Strait and arrived in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Considering that half of the tsunami source region was in the inland area and the earthquake magnitude (Mw=7.5~8.0) was moderate, the tsunami signal was relatively large. This phenomenon also indicated that the tsunami was able to reach Taiwan with a small energy decaying rate. In this paper, we reconstructed the scenario which matched the historical records of the 1604 Quanzhou event, and further analyzed the sensitivity of location and magnitude to the wave height in Taiwan. We discovered that moving the source region offshore, the tsunami wave height increased on the north-western coast of Taiwan with dense population nowadays. In order to have thorough understanding of the potential threat tsunami can pose to the west coast of Taiwan, we performed impact intensity analysis (IIA). The IIA covered the region of Taiwan Strait and entire part of the South China Sea. The results showed that the potential tsunami threat of the northern part of the coast came mainly from the Quanzhou area, and the southern part would face the threat from the north segment of Manila Trench and the submarine landslide originating from the southwestern continental slope.",

            "abstract": "Water Management in the U.S. Southwest is under increasing scrutiny as many areas endure persistent drought. The impact of these prolonged dry conditions is a product of regional climate and hydrological conditions, but also of a highly engineered water management infrastructure and a complex web of social arrangements whereby water is allocated, shared, exchanged, used, re-used, and finally consumed.\nWe coupled an agent-based model with a regional hydrological model to understand the dynamics in one richly studied and highly populous area: southern Arizona, U.S.A., including metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson. There, multiple management entities representing an array of municipalities and other water providers and customers, including private companies and Native American tribes are enmeshed in a complex legal and economic context in which water is bought, leased, banked, and exchanged in a variety of ways and on multiple temporal and physical scales.\nA recurrent question in the literature of adaptive management is the impact of management structure on overall system performance. To explore this, we constructed an agent-based model to capture this social complexity, and coupled this with a physical hydrological model that we used to drive the system under a variety of water stress scenarios and to assess the regional impact of the social system's performance. We report the outcomes of ensembles of runs in which varieties of alternative policy constraints and management strategies are considered. We hope to contribute to policy discussions in this area and connected and legislatively similar areas (such as California) as current conditions change and existing legal and policy structures are revised. Additionally, we comment on the challenges of integrating models that ostensibly are in different domains (physical and social) but that independently represent a system in which physical processes and human actions are closely intertwined and difficult to disentangle.",

Strong relations were observed between total precipitation for a given storm, deep (70 cm below surface) antecedent soil moisture content and the volume of runoff. However, the strength of the relations varied based on occurrence during the growing (April – September; 172 storms) or dormant (October – March; 125 storms) period. In general, soil moisture responded at a minimum of 15 cm depth for all but 18 events. In addition, we found storms that initiated a response of deep soil moisture (70 cm below surface) to be an important factor relating to storm runoff and water yield. Seventy percent of the dormant period storms generated a response at 70 cm depth compared to 58% of growing period storms. A stronger relation between soil moisture and water yield was noted during the dormant period and indicated that all storms that produced a water yield >12% occurred when deep pre-event soil moisture was >20%. Similar patterns were also present during the growing season with occasional intense thunderstorms also generating higher water yields even in the absence of high soil moisture. The importance of deep soil moisture likely reflects the overall status of watershed storage conditions.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial bedforms such as ripples and plane bed are formed by interactions between flows and processes of sediment transport. Sedimentary structures formed by bedforms, hence, are clues to reconstruct paleo-flow conditions. For analysis of sedimentary structures, bedform existence diagrams have been proposed on the basis of laboratory and field observations, and have been widely used. To utilize the bedform existence diagrams for analysis of sedimentary structures, boundary lines of bedform stability regions are significant.\nThis study provides boundary lines of bedform stability regions defined as discriminant functions of dimensionless parameters. In previous studies, the lines were described manually without quantitative examination. Thus, previous studies that apply these diagrams to sedimentary structures lack sufficient statistic basis. To this end, this study obtained boundary lines as polynomial equations of dimensionless parameters.\nFirst of all, we defined a new bedform existence diagram using three parameters in dimensionless form. Some of diagrams in previous studies were not expressed in sufficient form. This study produces a new bedform stability diagram, which defines bedform stability regions by three dimensionless parameters: dimensionless grain size D*, Shields mobility parameter τ* and Froude number Fr.\nOn the basis of the diagram described above, discriminant functions are derived by following procedures. At first, a polynomial function with arbitrary coefficients which divides parametric space is supposed as a candidate of a discriminant function. Then, the ratio of data points of bedform experiments that was judged incorrectly by the polynomial function is calculated. At last, in order to minimize the ratio, coefficients of polynomial function is optimized.\nThe discriminant functions of bedforms obtained in this study can serve quantitative paleo-flow analysis of sedimentary structures. Their form is Fr = ƒ(D*, τ*). This function can be recast in the form U = ƒ(D, h), where U = flow velocity; D = sediment particle size; h = flow depth. Thus, when we obtain the data of sediment particle size and flow depth from sedimentary structures, we can estimate paleo-flow velocity. The discriminant functions are useful and objective for estimation of paleo-flow conditions.",

            "abstract": "Radiogenic 40Ar stored in white mica may be disturbed or reset by a variety of processes including deformation, recrystallization and diffusion. Ductile shear zone mylonites are ideal for examining the effects of deformation and dynamic re-/neo-crystallization on white mica at temperatures for which thermal diffusion of Ar is inefficient. Here we investigate Ar behaviour in white mica from Late Silurian syn-tectonic granitoids emplaced into the trailing edge of the Ganderian microcontinent, Newfoundland Appalachians. Subsequent regional metamorphism and development of the broad Wing Pond shear zone are interpreted to record Acadian orogenesis, resulting from the docking of Avalonia to Ganderia (composite Laurentian margin) by sinistral-oblique transpressional collision. The suture was later reactivated as a lower temperature, narrow dextral-sense shear zone. The window for sinistral and dextral slip is constrained by emplacement of the syn-tectonic granitoids and a post-tectonic pluton that stitches the Dover fault at 377±4 Ma.\nIn this study we combine in situ 40Ar/39Ar analyses with deformation temperatures from quartz c-axis fabrics to investigate the influence of deformation on Ar retention in white mica for differing structural positions. Zircon U-Pb ages indicate granitoid emplacement ca. 430-425 Ma. Monazite U-Pb ages that span ca. 429 - 403 Ma are interpreted to record recrystallization during high temperature metamorphism and deformation. High spatial-resolution in situ 40Ar/39Ar laser analyses of white mica range from ca. 403 Ma to 390-375 Ma (depending on sample) such that ages reflect the structural field relationships. Relatively low deformation temperatures, single-grain age transects inconsistent with Dodsonian diffusion, and localization of older and younger age domains at thin section scale argue for deformation-induced loss of 40Ar. These data demonstrate the potential of spatially-controlled 40Ar/39Ar age data in elucidating thermal and deformational histories of deformed and metamorphosed rocks.",

I will first summarize the dynamics behind the two-timescale response and how it can help reconcile diverging views on the relationship between ozone depletion and Antarctic sea ice changes. Using numerical experiments, I will then show that knowledge of the two-timescale response can be used to predict how the coupled climate responds to a time-varying ozone distribution, such as one of depletion and recovery. These ideas will then be used to evaluate how 1) ozone depletion might have contributed to recent observed decadal Antarctic sea-ice trends and 2) the ozone-driven signal can emerge from natural variability. Finally, implications for the ability of coupled climate models to reproduce observed sea-ice trends will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Storing water in times of excess for use in times of shortage is an essential water-management tool, especially in climates typified by precipitation in one season and demand in another. The three primary water storage mechanisms in the Western US, and much of the world in fact, are: seasonal snow pack, surface water reservoirs, and groundwater aquifers. In California, nearly every major river has one or more large dam and reservoir and current focus has shifted toward off-stream storage. In addition to California’s surface reservoirs, groundwater aquifers provide huge volumes of water storage that are heavily utilized during times of drought. With California’s new Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) substantial attention is presently focused on developing strategies for using groundwater storage more effectively in conjunction with surface-storage reservoirs. However, compared to surface water storage, we need to think differently and develop new frameworks if we want to manage groundwater storage sustainably. Despite its immense capacity, groundwater storage is harder to manage because there are physical constraints to how fast water can be put into and withdrawn from aquifers, its boundaries are not as well defined as those of a surface reservoir, and it is part of a dynamic, porous media flow system where the Theis concepts of capture govern. Therefore, groundwater does not behave as a level pool like surface water reservoirs, which has several implications for effective management: 1) extraction/injection locations can have substantial impacts on the system, 2) interactions with the surface water systems can be nonlinear and complex and 3) hydraulic effects can continue long after pumping/injection has stopped. These nonlinear spatial and temporal responses, coupled with long time scales, makes management of groundwater storage much different than surface water storage. Furthermore, failure to fully understand these issues can lead to mismanagement of groundwater storage with long-term implications on surface water/groundwater interactions. This work uses numerical models of groundwater flow to quantify capture from pumping and demonstrate issues of sustainable groundwater storage while using Lake Tahoe for a comparative analogy.",

Modeling the observations of the scattering poalrization in spectral lines requires the solution of polarized radiative transfer equation. Although solution is easier in one-dimenion, to be more realistic we must go for multi-dimensional geometries. In particular Ca II K line is appropriate for chromospheric diagnostics as it contains information on the less understood topics such as (1) scattering mechansim called partial frequency redistribution, (2) effect of magnetic field on line polarization in the chromosphere through Hanle effect, and (3) spatial structuring of the chromosphere that cause modifications in line polarization.

Since we cannot directly observe processes occurring at depth, we rely on models and experiments to constrain the rheological behavior of partially molten rocks. Here, we present the results of an experimental investigation of the role of viscous anisotropy on melt segregation in partially molten rocks through Poiseuille flow experiments. Partially molten rock samples with a composition of either forsterite or anorthite plus a few percent melt were prepared from vacuum sintered powders and taken to 1200ºC at 0.1 MPa. The partially molten samples were then extruded through a channel of circular cross section under a fixed pressure gradient at 1200o to 1500oC. The melt distribution in the channel was subsequently mapped through image analyses of optical and backscattered electron microscopy images. In these experiments, melt segregates from the center toward the outer radius of the channel with the melt fraction at the outer radius increasing to twice that at the center. These results are consistent with base-state melt segregation as predicted by Takei and Holtzman (JGR, 2009), Takei and Katz (JFM, 2013) and Allwright and Katz (GJI, 2014) for sheared partially molten rocks for which viscosity is anisotropic due to the stress-induced, grain-scale alignment of melt.",

            "abstract": "Peat-forming regions are significant components of the earth system in terms of carbon exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere. While attention has been given to processes controlling carbon accumulation in major peatland/lowland regions at high latitudes, less is known about the processes controlling soil carbon accumulation rates in other globally abundant peat-forming ecosystems, such as lowland arctic forests. These systems are potentially important for two reasons: (1) Many lowland forest peatlands exist at the interface between uplands and aquatic systems; the onset and rate of peat accumulation, as well as the composition of peat mosses, may therefore alter the biogeochemical properties of lakes and streams; (2) soil carbon accumulation might differ from rates observed from the larger open peatlands, offering additional insights to the vulnerability of high-latitude peat to climatic change. We collected and dated 25 peat cores from eight lake sites in an 18,000-km2 low-arctic region of Manitoba Canada and measured areal carbon accumulation rates, charcoal concentration (as a proxy for fire severity), and plant macrofossils (as a proxy for vegetation change). The distribution of basal radiocarbon dates indicates that the oldest peat initiation occurred 7,000-8,000 B.P. in post-glacial landscapes, but peak peat formation occurred < 3,000 B.P., presumably as landscape paludification rose with increased net moisture during Neoglacial cooling. In locations where peat initiation occurred before 6,000 B.P., the initial communities were variable (bog-poor fen-moderate rich fen), whereas most sites initiating after 6,000 B.P. formed (and remained) as bogs, suggesting increasing dominance of Sphagnum peatmosses as paludification progressed. Carbon accumulation rates were consistently low (10-30 gm-2y-1), with no clear correlation to fire. Also absent was rapid accumulation early in the peatland development characteristic of early successional fens. These results indicate that peat formation and accumulation in lowland forests may respond differently to internal and exogenous drivers compared to larger peatland landscapes and that widespread Sphagnum initiation after 6,000 B.P. may have the potential to alter aquatic biogeochemistry since the mid Holocene.",

            "abstract": "The development and configuration of the subglacial hydraulic system under the ablation zone of the western Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) modulates seasonal surface-melt-driven perturbations in ice surface velocity. Following the onset of the summer melt season, elevated ice velocities gradually decrease, suggestive of inefficient drainage transitioning to an efficient channelized drainage system. This ice velocity pattern is observed throughout much of the ablation zone; however, recent work suggests that the development of ice-incised subglacial channels may be limited at higher elevations. This apparent incompatibility has yet to be extensively explored. In order to examine the role of subglacial channelization in determining the seasonal ice velocity pattern, we compare GPS-derived ice surface velocities from 2011 and modeled subglacial channel development using moulin locations, supraglacial melt production, and realistic ice and bed conditions from the Paakitsoq Region of the GrIS. In particular, we focus on the duration of early melt season high-pressures and associated elevated ice velocities. We find that in near-terminus regions, the duration of modeled high pressures agrees with high GPS-observed ice velocities. Farther inland, this relationship weakens, suggesting that the observed deceleration may not be solely driven by subglacial channelization and is instead driven by other mechanisms. Our results also suggest that seasonal surface ice-velocity patterns are not solely indicative of local transitions in subglacial drainage between distributed and channelized networks.",

            "abstract": "A comparison was made between various stable isotope measurement techniques for the purpose of quantifying each methods capability for use in hydrocarbon analyses applicable to fields such as geochemistry, agriculture, forensics and authenticity testing. Measurement techniques include: (1) Cavity Ring-down spectrometry (CRDS) using a Picarro 2120-A interfaced with a combustion module (CM) to facilitate conversion of hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water (2) Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) using a Thermo 253 IRMS with gas chromatographic separation prior to combustion to carbon dioxide or high temperature pyrolysis to hydrogen for isotope ratio measurement. Also, off line combustion to carbon dioxide and water with further reduction to hydrogen and dual-inlet measurement by IRMS. IRMS techniques have proven track records for measurement accuracy and precision but require independent analyses of carbon and hydrogen since one needs to oxidize carbon but reduce water to hydrogen prior to measurement or pyrolyze hydrocarbons directly into hydrogen after gas chromatographic separation. Cavity ring-down spectrometry can measure carbon dioxide and water simultaneously eliminating the need for two separate measurements of carbon and hydrogen isotopes. Although the CRDS suffers from memory effects following combustion and transfer of gases early on, new technology has reduced this to acceptable levels for accurate determinations of carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios. In this study, various hydrocarbon materials were used over an extended period of time to determine the best combination of sample size, replicate analyses and combustion column composition and life. The data presented here indicates isotopic measurements by CM-CRDS, for both solid and volatile liquid samples, compare well with GC/IRMS and off-line dual inlet methods of analysis.",

J Hall, and W. Martin, Geobiology, 2010, 8, 355). Key catalysts/surfaces at the ocean crust boundary would have interacted with these dissolved gases, giving rise to larger biomolecules and ultimately life. Among the catalysts found at present in hydrothermal system, Ni3Fe (Awaruite) and NiFe (Tetrataenite) stand out because they convert simple di and triatomic molecules to more complex structures; for example, Awaruite has been shown to produce NH3 from hydrogen and nitrogen precursors (Alexander Smirnov, Douglas Hausner, Richard Laffers, Daniel R Strongin, and Marton AA Schoonen, Geochemical Transactions, 2008, 9:5).\nThe goal of this study is to examine the role of iron nickel clusters with Awaruite and Tetrataenite stoichiometries in converting atomic nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia. Using a basin-hopping algorithmic procedure, the global minima of Awaruite and Tetrataenite clusters with up to 35 atoms have been identified along with their affinity to nitrogen and hydrogen attachment has been examined (i.e. atom position, cluster edges, and surface sites). Preliminary results indicate that atomic nitrogen attaches onto mixed iron nickel cluster surface sites, with distinct discontinuities in the binding energy profile at magic cluster number positions. We also studied the effects of cluster composition on the affinity of nitrogen and hydrogen to attach to Ni13-xFex with up to x=13. These results, for both scenarios (size and compositional variation), indicate that nano-sized iron-nickel clusters would drive the initial transformation of nitrogen and hydrogen toward NH3, with important implications for the chemistry of Earth's early atmosphere.",

Prime science observations began in September 2015 when orbit apogee had moved to the dusk sector at magnetopause distances. Signatures of magnetotail dynamics were observed during payload and fleet commissioning. The electrodynamic context of the magnetotail events at MMS as well as observations at the dusk and afternoon magnetopause is assessed using correlative observations from low Earth orbit and ground-based instruments including the Active Magnetosphere and Polar Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), SuperMAG, and SuperDARN. Substorm current onsets are prevalent in AMPERE data and are highly correlated with magnetotail injections and dipolarizations observed by MMS. To better constrain how the MMS magnetotail observations are related to global processes, we also examine the occurrence and prevalence of similar ionospheric onset signatures when MMS was at high altitudes in the magnetotail but observed no local signatures of injections or dipolarizations. For MMS magnetopause observations, we explore the relationship of magnetic reconnection signatures at MMS with the convection patterns derived from AMPERE and ionosphere observations to establish the relationship of the local MMS observations and global magnetospheric convective state.",

            "abstract": "A basic understanding of how trace elements are incorporated in silicate melts is critical to assess our understanding of trace element partitioning during the early stages of planetary formation and large scale magmatic processes. Although it is well known that melt compositional changes affect the partitioning of trace elements, the degree to which these ratios are influenced by pressure-induced modifications in melt structure is poorly constrained due to the difficulty of collecting structural information on bonding environments in-situ.\nHere we present results from in-situ diamond anvil cell (DAC) X-ray diffraction experiments on the local environment of neodymium in depolymerised (basaltic) silicate melts at pressures up to 60 GPa. High temperature conditions were generated through laser heating DACs and high quality structural data was collected up to >6 Å. We explore the effect of pressure on trace element speciation in both melt and glass phases. Our in-situ data on the bonding environment provides much needed insight into the influence of melt structure on trace element behaviour, and will allow more realistic models of trace elements partitioning within the mantle.",

            "abstract": "The SP Mountain area of the San Francisco Volcanic Field, AZ, has been used as an analog mission development site for NASA since 1998. This area consists of basaltic cinder cones, lava flows and maar craters that have been active since mid-Miocene, with the youngest events occurring within the last 10,000 years. The area has been used because its geologic and topographic resemblance to lunar and Martian terrains provides an ideal venue for testing hardware and science operations practices that might be employed on planetary surfaces, as well as training astronauts in field geology. Analog operations have often led to insights that spurred new scientific investigations. Most recently, an investigation of the 7504 cone was initiated due to perceptions that Apollo-style traverse plans executed during the Desert RATS 2010 mission had characterized the area incorrectly, leading to concerns that the Apollo traverse planning process was scientifically flawed. This investigation revealed a complex history of fissure eruptions of lava and cinders, cinder cone development, a cone-fill-and-spill episode, extensive rheomorphic lava flow initiation and emplacement, and cone sector collapse that led to a final lava flow. This history was not discernible on pre-RATS mission photogeology, although independent analysis of RATS 2010 data and samples develped a “75% complete solution” that validated the pre-RATS mission planning and Apollo traverse planning and execution. The study also pointed out that the development of scientific knowledge with time in a given field area is not linear, but may follow a functional form that rises steeply in the early period of an investigation but flattens out in the later period, asymptotically approaching a theoretical “complete knowledge” point that probably cannot be achieved. This implies that future human missions must be prepared to shift geographic areas of investigation regularly if significant science returns are to be forthcoming.",

The high geomagnetic activity not just influenced the high MLAT longitude, but also in middle MLAT longitude. However, the influence in Kelan was quite different from Millstone Hill, which most significant variation was a large westward zonal wind (~ 200 m/s).

            "abstract": "Wind farms are an important resource for electrical generation in the Central U.S., however with each installation there are many poorly documented interactions with the local and surrounding environment. The impact of wind farms on surface microclimate is largely understood conceptually using numerical or wind tunnel models or ex situ satellite-detected changes. Measurements suitable for calibration of numerical simulations are few and of limited applicability but are urgently needed to improve parameterization of wind farm aerodynamics influenced by the diurnal evolution of the boundary layer. Among large eddy simulations of wind farm wakes in thermally stable stratification, there are discrepancies on the influence of turbine-induced mixing on the surface heat flux. We provide measurements from seven surface flux stations, vertical profiling LiDARs located upwind and downwind of turbines, and SCADA measurements from turbines during the 2013 Crop Wind Energy Experiment (CWEX-13) as the best evidence for the variability of turbine induced heat flux within a large wind farm. Examination of ambient conditions (wind direction, wind veer, and thermal stratification) and on turbine operation factors (hub-height wind speed, normalized power) reveal conditions that lead to the largest modification of heat flux. Our results demonstrate the highest flux change from the reference station to be where the leading few lines of turbines influence the surface. Under stably stratified conditions turbine-scale turbulence is highly efficient at bringing warmer air aloft to the surface, leading to an increase in downward heat flux. Conversely we see that the combination of wakes from several lines of turbines reduces the flux contrast from the reference station. In this regime of deep wind-farm flow, wake turbulence is similar in scale and intensity to the reference conditions. These analysis tools can be extended to other turbine SCADA and microclimate variables (e.g. temperature) to improve basic understanding of turbine-turbine and total wind farm wake interactions. Forthcoming tall-tower measurements will provide additional opportunities for comparison of simulated wind and thermal profiles in non-wake, and waked flow conditions.",

No aquifer maps are available from government agencies and a review of the available literature and discussions with experts suggests several contradicting views on the structure of fracture aquifers.\nUsing data from over a hundred borewell camera scans in a milli-watershed covering 6 sq km, we tested multiple hypothesis on possible structures.

The population for 2050 is forecasted to grow by 2.3 billion people, resulting in close to a 40% increase in food demand (Alexandratos, Bruinsma 2012). This will severely increase pressure on the earth and on crop harvesting processes to incorporate carbon emissions reduction strategies. Optimal land use analysis and innovation can provide feasible solutions for these problems.\nA key environmental feature around which land use systems should be carefully planned and maintained is the Mississippi River, the largest watershed system in the United States. Along head of the Lower Mississippi Watershed lie several farming communities including Cairo, Illinois. The primary land use for the area inhabited by these communities consists of soybeans, corn, and pasture. These crops have varying carbon storage capacities, economic and social benefits, and environmental consequences. In order to maximize social, economic, and environmental benefits and sustainability, these crops were analyzed over time, spatial correlation, and crop size area.\nWhen considering risks of carbon emissions, economic decline, landscape erosion and harmful runoff, a localized switchgrass buffer remains a feasible solution. Its strengths as a native, reliable plant with high carbon sequestration and biomass harvest potential yield it to be more prevalently implemented at the head of the Lower Mississippi Watershed. However, there are multiple factors that must be considered before implementing broad agricultural policies and practices. Thorough analyses should be performed frequently to assess the effects of major land use change and can be used to identify the optimized applications for farmers and communities.",

            "abstract": "The Lau Backarc Spreading Center (LBSC) and the Tonga Arc are an exemplary location for studying melt production and migration in a complex subduction system. The LBSC is an archetype of backarc spreading centers, but displays significant variation along strike and is composed of three primary segments, the Central Lau Spreading Center, the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC), and the Valu Fa Spreading Center (VFSC). Magma geochemistry varies with decreasing distance to the arc from north to south, with increasing concentrations of water and fluid-mobile elements in the south.\nThis study uses body wave tomography to investigate the mantle structure and processes associated with these surficial along-strike variations. We invert more than 50,000 arrival times from local events recorded by 51 ocean bottom seismometers and 16 broadband land stations in 2009-2010, arrivals from a previous experiment in 1994, and teleseismic arrivals for P- and S-wave velocity models.\nThese body wave velocity models show distinct low velocity regions within the upper 100 km beneath the volcanic arc and ELSC, but these separate anomalies merge beneath the VFSC, indicating a common source for arc and backarc magmas in the south. At depths greater than 50 km, we find slower velocities beneath the ELSC than beneath the VFSC, consistent with previous studies suggesting greater in situ-melt concentration beneath the ELSC. This has been interpreted as resulting from faster and more efficient melt extraction in the south due to the higher water contents (Wei et al., 2015). A dominant first-order feature at depths greater than 100km is a north-south low velocity zone beneath the ELSC that extends to at least 300km depth, tilting westward with increasing depth. This suggests that the melt source region for the ELSC occurs along the upper part of a rising mantle flow pattern sourced at depths of at least 300 km depth in the far backarc region.",

            "abstract": "An elongated depression was located in an ENE-WSW direction between the southern margin of the forearc basin and the outer ridge off Kumano. A terminal basin that captures all sediments supplied from outside is developed within this depression, making it an adequate site to study paleoseismology using seismogenic turbidites.\nPrevious study results reveal the Cs-137 and Pb-210 that the upper 17-cm mud layer was deposited immediately after the 2004 off Kii Peninsula earthquakes (Ashi et al., 2015, JpGU Meeting abstract). We herein investigate the characteristics of marine seismogenic turbidites based on various measurements including their compositions, X-ray CT images, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS). We observed a very thin fine-grained sand layer of 6 mm thick at 17 cm below seafloor and a volcanic ash layer of 15 cm thick at 5.1 m. The X-ray CT image shows seven silty clay laminations thinning upwards at 6 -15 cm below seafloor with homogeneous clay based silt above it, and several foraminifera-enriched layer below 1.7 m. The AMS parameters decrease upwards in the interval showing parallel/cross laminations and the lowest value is measured in the overlying silt layer. Moreover, the paleocurrent directions showed the NW-SE flow direction. These results indicate that the upper 17 cm layer beginning from the very fine-grained sand can be interpreted to be formed by a low density reflected gravity flow between the SE and NW dipping slopes of the basin. Structural observations by X-ray CT scanner reveal characteristic structures yielding various orientation oblique to bedding plane at the mud layer 17 cm below seafloor, suggesting that the structure is likely formed by coseismic deformation accompanied by the earthquake in 2004 or earlier ones. Magnetic fabrics derived from AMS measurements and the structure observed by X-ray CT scanner also agree to this picture.",

Initial characterization of these areas is essential in order to establish a baseline against which to assess potential future changes due to climate and anthropogenic change. In the Caribbean, over 37,500 sq km of previously unmapped seafloor were mapped with a high resolution multibeam revealing rugged canyons along shelf breaks, intricate incised channels, and complex tectonic features. 12 ROV dives, in the 300-6,000 m depth range, visually explored seamounts, escarpments, submarine canyons, and the water column revealing diverse ecosystems and habitats. Discoveries include large assemblages of deep sea corals, range extensions, and observations of several rare and potentially new organisms - including a seastar that had not been documented since its holotype specimen. In the Pacific, over 50,000 sq km of seafloor were mapped in high-resolution, revealing long linear ridge and tectonic fracture zone features, both peaked and flat-topped seamounts, and numerous features that appear to be volcanic in origin. To better understand ecosystem dynamics in depths greater than 2,000 m, the deepest ever ROV surveys and sampling were conducted in remote Pacific island marine sanctuaries and monuments. Novel observations include range extensions and exploration of dense deep sea coral and sponge habitat. Baseline habitat characterization was also conducted on seamounts within the Prime Crust Zone (PCZ), an area with the highest expected concentration of deep-sea minerals in the Pacific. The Hawaiian operations marked the first ever ROV sampling effort conducted onboard Okeanos, and several geological and biological samples are now available at museums and sample repositories in addition to all digital data available through the National Archives.",

            "abstract": "A novel microwave radiometric technique, wideband autocorrelation radiometry (WiBAR), offers a deterministic method of remotely sensing the propagation time τdelay of microwaves through low loss layers at the bottom of the atmosphere. Terrestrial examples are the snow and lake ice packs. This technique is based on the Planck radiation from the surface beneath the pack which travels upwards through the pack towards the radiometer; such a signal we call a direct signal. On the other hand, part of this radiation reflects back from the pack’s upper interface then from its lower interface, before traveling towards the radiometer’s antenna. Thus, there are two signals received by the radiometer, the direct signal and a delayed copy of it. The microwave propagation time τdelay through the pack yields a measure of its vertical extent. We report a time series of measurements of the ice pack on Lake Superior from February to April 2014 to demonstrate this technique. The observations are done at frequencies from 7 to 10 GHz. At these frequencies, the volume and surface scattering are small in the ice pack. This technique is inherently low-power since there is no transmitter as opposed to active remote sensing techniques. The results of this paper is to present the WiBAR technique and show that the microwave travel time within a dry snow pack and lake ice pack can be deterministically measured for different thicknesses using this technique.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies of the seismically slow feature (a.k.a. “divot”) in the mantle beneath southern New England have relied upon low-resolution surface wave tomography to determine its shape. Using higher-resolution teleseismic P and S wave travel times, we find that it is much smaller, much sharper-edged and much stronger than has previously been inferred. The feature causes a clear, spatially coherent “late” anomaly, of up to 1 s for P waves and 3 s for S waves. Located in the asthenosphere, it is centered at a depth of ~200 km beneath central New Hampshire (43.62N, 72.02W). When modeled as Gaussian in shape, it measures about 150 km horizontally and 190 km vertically and has a minimum compressional wave speed 0.43 km/s below the AK135 global model. These parameters have been estimated by comparing the observed travel time anomalies with those determined by 3D ray tracing through hypothetical models, and especially by matching parallax and maximum delay. S and P wave travel time anomalies scale across the Quebec-New England region with an average ratio of 3.51 +/- 0.74 (95% confidence). The lack of anomalously high ratios for ray paths crossing the center of the feature argues against the presence of melt. No “fading” of the feature’s travel time anomaly is detected for earthquakes with shallow rays, suggesting it is not due to seismic anisotropy with a sub-vertical slow axis. The strength of the shear wave anomaly is comparable to that of the much larger slow anomaly beneath Southern California (up to 9%), which suggests that, like Southern California, it has a thermal origin. Previous authors have argued for a connection between it and the Great Meteor hotspot, which crossed New Hampshire at 109 Ma. Our improved model places it exactly on the hotspot track. However it is far too small, sharp-edged, and strong to be a relic thermal anomaly from hot material emplaced at 109 Ma. We propose it represents a modern asthenospheric “hot zone”, whose location has been steered by the much older hotspot track",

In Asia, there are large uptake regions such as forests in boreal and temperate regions. In this study, to diagnose the surface CO2 flux in the globe and Asia, CO2 observations were assimilated in the CarbonTracker developed by NOAA. The CarbonTracker is an inverse modeling system that estimates the surface CO2 flux using an ensemble Kalman filter with atmospheric CO2 measurements as a constraint. First, the capability of CarbonTracker as an analysis tool for estimating surface CO2 flux in Asia was investigated. Different from the CarbonTracker developed by NOAA, a nesting domain centered on Asia was used with additional observations in Asia. In addition, a diagnostic tool to calculate the effect of individual CO2 observations on estimating the surface CO2 flux was developed using the analysis sensitivity to observation and information content in the CarbonTracker framework.\nThe results showed that CarbonTracker works appropriately for estimating surface CO2 flux. The nesting domain centered in Asia produces a detailed estimate of the surface CO2 fluxes and exhibited better agreement with the CO2 observations in Asia. Additional observations provide beneficial impact on the estimated surface CO2 flux in Asia and Europe. The analysis sensitivity showed seasonal variations with greater sensitivities in summer and lower sensitivities in winter. Strong correlation exists between the information content and the optimized surface CO2 flux.",

            "abstract": "While numerous studies have demonstrated a significant contribution of super-micron particles to the total aerosol mass for many regions with large aerosol loading, comparatively little is known about the importance of these particles in relatively clean areas common to much of the globe. To investigate their potential importance, we take advantage of datasets collected from ground-based observations during recent field campaigns supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) and Atmospheric System Research (ASR) Programs. These campaigns were designed to provide a comprehensive dataset that can be used to investigate important climate science questions, including those related to aerosols, for many regions around the world using the unique capabilities of the ARM Mobile Facility (AMF;\nhttp://www.arm.gov/sites/amf\n). The AMF datasets integrate observations from numerous instruments for sampling aerosol and cloud and radiative properties, including the Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR), a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), a three-wavelength nephelometer, and a Single Particle Mass Spectrometer (SPLAT II). The latter was used to characterize the size, composition, and density of individual particles in the size range from 50 to 3,000 nm. We analyze column and near-surface data from these instruments to explore the possible importance of super-micron particles to aerosol microphysical and optical properties. We find that their contribution to the climate-relevant total scattering and absorption can be quite large (50% and 30%, for scattering and absorption, respectively). These large contributions occur even in areas with low-to-moderate aerosol loading (total scattering < 50 Mm-1) located far from major sources. We discuss the expected implications from our results to the evaluation and improvement of regional and global climate models.",

In the future, mean annual precipitation is predicted to decrease in California, although frequency of heavy precipitation events may increase. To reconstruct annual precipitation history in Southern California, including both the magnitude and recurrence intervals, we analyze sediment from two Late Holocene (past ~150 years and past ~2 ka) and five Pleistocene (~400-450 ka [MIS 11 and 12] and ~735 ka [MIS 18]) cores collected in Santa Barbara Basin using data from XRF core scans for elements associated with the terrigenous siliciclastic detrital fraction of core sediment (Al, Fe, K, Rb, Si, Ti, Zr). We develop a floating annual age model for each core through identification of the annual signal in the siliciclastic detrital fraction. Siliciclastic detrital element concentrations increase in sediment associated with precipitation events and floods, and decrease in sediment associated with droughts. Variability in the concentrations of these elements can thus be used as a precipitation and river runoff proxy. We investigate changes in annual detrital sediment input during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial climate states, and changes due to rapid climate change (centennial to millennial time scales). Power spectral analysis of our annually tuned time series reveals precipitation periodicities associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (15-25, 50-70 years) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (2-7 years) that are dissimilar to common tidal perigee and nodal periods. These results provide information on the nature and response of precipitation patterns due to past changes in climate forcing, which will improve climate predictions for this region, especially interannual and decadal variability that impact climate on human timescales (i.e. <100 years).",

Regional scale analyses that link terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across spatial scales are needed to understand the mechanisms of response and tradeoffs among different ecosystem services. We coupled the terrestrial ecosystem model, PnET, with a river network model, FrAMES, to explore how terrestrial and aquatic conditions simultaneously respond to variation and changes in climate and land use. We applied the coupled model to the Merrimack R. watershed, NH/MA, USA, to understand how impacts vary at different nested basin scales. The coupled PnET-FrAMES predicts variables relevant to key ecosystem services including snow pack, runoff, woody biomass accumulation, net carbon sequestration, nitrogen runoff, discharge, conductivity, water temperature, aquatic denitrification, and nitrogen flux. We used statistically downscaled high and low emission scenarios of GCMs (GFDL CM2.1) to explore projected future responses to 2100. Some variables were more sensitive (snowpack, runoff, net carbon sequestration, water temperature) than others (woody biomass, conductivity, nitrogen concentration) to interannual climate variability. Water quality and terrestrial ecosystem responses were more sensitive to land use changes. Water quality responses are buffered in large rivers due to the dilution capacity of forested areas of the watersheds, but this dilution capacity is altered by future climate changes. Coupled terrestrial-aquatic models at regional scales using downscale climate projections will be essential for planning adaption and mitigation strategies in response to future climate and land use change.",

These biophysical perturbations subsequently change radiation budget at land surface and land-atmosphere exchange in water and energy, and ultimately influence local/regional climate. Here, we combine long-term in situ field measurements, remote sensing observations, and regional earth system modeling to improve our understanding of changes in biophysical climate regulation services from converting native grassland to perennial bioenergy crops. In the US Midwest, albedo change as a result of cultivating native grassland for cellulosic bioenergy feedstocks could enhance the net greenhouse gases (GHGs) mitigation benefit of cellulosic bioenergy production (116.5 MgCO2 ha-1) by 20% over a time horizon of 50 years. With an integrated climate-agroecosystem model, parameterized with in situ and remote sensing data, we further demonstrate that cultivating native grassland may result in noticeable difference in simulated regional climate (e.g. precipitation, temperature, and radiation budget), highlighting the importance of additionally including biophysical climate services in evaluating land-based climate mitigation activities, such as bioenergy production.",

            "abstract": "The persistence of non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs) in the subsurface has led to the development of several remediation technologies to address this environmental problem. One such group of technologies (in situ thermal treatment) uses heat to volatilize contaminants. Subsurface temperature measurements are often used to monitor progress and optimize contaminant removal. However, when NAPL and water are heated together, gas is created at a temperature lower than the boiling point of either liquid (co-boiling), which can affect temperature observations.\nTo examine the effect of co-boiling on observed temperatures and NAPL mass removal, a series of heated laboratory experiments were performed using single and multi-component NAPLs. The experiments consisted of glass jars filled with a mixture of sand, water, and NAPL mixed to obtain an approximately uniform NAPL distribution within the jar. The experiments were heated from the outside and interior temperatures were measured using a thermocouple. The tests showed that local-scale temperature measurements are unreliable in indicating the end of co-boiling and may not indicate complete mass removal. This is because a well-defined co-boiling plateau does not exist when heating a multi-component NAPL and the temperature is dependent on the proximity of NAPL to the monitoring point.\nTo further investigate temperature distributions and the potential to use gas production as a complementary indicator of NAPL removal, a 2D finite-difference mass transport model was used that incorporated heat transport, latent heat, phase change, and a multicomponent gas phase and used a macroscopic invasion percolation (MIP) model to simulate gas movement. Latent heat was calculated by multiplying specific latent heat, which is an intrinsic property of a substance, by the amount of liquid mass being vaporized and its incorporation into the model allowed for the simulation of co-boiling plateaus (during single component NAPL boiling). The developed model was used to examine the spatial distributions of gas production and temperature during heating of water and NAPL, for a variety of NAPL source configurations, to better understand the processes occurring during thermal remediation activities and how to improve the interpretation of measured temperatures.",

            "abstract": "High resolution satellite imagery, field spectral measurements using a portable ASD spectrometer, and 2013 hyperspectral AVIRIS imagery were used to evaluate the age of the Martinez Mountain Landslide (MML) near the Salton Sea, in order to determine the relative ages of adjacent alluvial fan surfaces and the potential for additional landslides, debris flows, and floods. The Salton Sea (SS) occupies a pluvial lake basin, with ancient shorelines ranging from 81 meters to 113 meters above the modern lake level. The highest shoreline overlaps the toe of the 0.24 – 0.38 km3 MML deposit derived from hydrothermally altered granites exposed near the summit of Martinez Mountain. The MML was originally believed to be of early Holocene age. However, AVIRIS mineral maps show abundant desert varnish on the top and toe of the landslide. Desert varnish can provide a means of relative dating of alluvial fan (AF) or landslide surfaces, as it accumulates at determinable rates over time. Based on the 1) highest levels of desert varnish accumulation mapped within the basin, 2) abundant evaporite playa minerals on top of the toe of the landslide, and 3) the highest shoreline of the ancestral lake overtopping the toe of the landslide with gastropod and bivalve shells, we conclude that the MML predates the oldest alluvial fan terraces and lake sediments exposed in the Coachella and Imperial valleys and must be older than early Holocene (i.e. Late Pleistocene?). Thus, the MML landslide has the potential to be used as a spectral endmember for desert varnish thickness and thus proxy for age discrimination of active AF washes versus desert pavements.\nGiven the older age of the MML landslide and low water levels in the modern SS, the risk from future rockslides of this size and related seiches is rather low. However, catastrophic floods and debris flows do occur along the most active AF channels; and the aftermath of such flows can be identified spectrally by montmorillonite crusts forming in recently flooded channels, as well as coarse-grained hyper-concentrated flow deposits that leave sorted (dark) heavy mineral concentrate behind. These observations, as well as supporting spectroscopic and change detection studies, will allow us to evaluate such hazards in this and similar inter-montane pluvial basins around the world.",

            "abstract": "The UK Turf2Surf project asks when, where and how coupling between C, N & P cycles occurs within terrestrial, freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. C-N-P cycling and fluxes are followed through two UK catchments, the Conwy and Ribble, which are Centre for Ecology and Hydrology catchment observatories for landscape scale research from source to sea. The Conwy is typical of non-industrialised areas with few discrete agricultural and industrial sources while the Ribble has a mixed urban and agricultural landscape. Both have areas of upland and moor with peats in the Conwy. Field and laboratory experiments track the incorporation of terrestrial C, N & P into the riverine ecosystems of the catchments and measure changes in C-N-P stoichiometry and cycling along the stream networks from uplands to the river-estuary transition zone (RETZ).\nWe present results focussed on the riverine systems. Flume mesocosms at 18 sites investigated in-stream nutrient processing and algal response to increased C, N & P concentrations (singly and combined). River reach experiments at 14 sites across land use and DOC gradients examined whole ecosystem metabolic response to C, N & P additions. Pore-water sampling with DET (diffusive equilibrium in thin films) gel probes at 5 sites quantified N & P fluxes and distributions across the sediment-water interface. Laboratory mesocosm experiments with streamwater from a variety of land uses (and DOC levels) studied the fate and cycling of stream organic matter subjected to controlled light/dark treatments, and the addition of N & P and a biocide.\nResults indicate that the study streams are N limited in the headwaters, but become progressively N & P co-limited near the RETZ. DOC processing in streams transitions from primarily photochemical degradation in headwaters (releasing N & P) to biotic aquatic DOC production (consuming N & P) downstream. Increasing C supply leads to increasing average ecosystem respiration irrespective of N & P status. Residence time provides a key constraint on the magnitude of C, N & P processing within stream reaches. These results have been incorporated into a conceptual model of C-N-P cycling in streams that describes dynamic changes in nutrient coupling, C-N-P stoichiometry, and DOC processing from the terrestrial-freshwater interface through to the RETZ.",

            "abstract": "Peninsular India is a stable cratonic region remote from active convergence yet it exhibits high, strongly asymmetric relief with a clear long-wavelength (\n>\n1000 km) eastward tilt from the Western Ghats escarpment (\n∼\n1000 -- 1500\\,m amsl) down to the floodplains of the Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari and Cauvery rivers. Offshore, oceanic residual depth measurements mirror this asymmetry and show excellent spatial correlation with upper mantle shear wave velocity anomalies identified in tomography models. South Indian topography deviates strongly from isostatic expectations and the\n9.3\n+3.8\n−2.2\nkm effective elastic thickness of the region generates flexural wavelengths considerably shorter than would be required for a flexural driving mechanism. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the long-wavelength tilt of the Indian Peninsula is supported by convective circulation in the Earth's upper mantle.\nTo investigate the evolution of this physiography we have jointly inverted 530 longitudinal river profiles to determine uplift rates as a function of space and time, calibrating our models against independent geological constraints including thermochronologic data, palaeosurface incision and sediment flux histories. Our results suggest that the tilt grew slowly from 40 Ma -- 25 Ma (\n≤\n0.02 mm a\n−1\n) but developed rapidly from 25 Ma onwards (\n≤\n0.2 mm a\n−1\n). This Neogene acceleration is reflected in the large-scale stratal architecture of the Indian margins with the development of regional unconformities on the western margin coinciding with a switch from progradation to aggradation on the eastern margin. The onset of rapid uplift predates the intensification of the Indian monsoon at 8 Ma suggesting that rock uplift rather than climate change is primarily responsible for the modern-day relief of the peninsula, although we note that a positive feedback is likely to exist between Western Ghats relief and precipitation patterns. As a result, we propose that late Cenozoic dynamic topography is responsible for the long-wavelength tilt of the Indian Peninsula.",

            "abstract": "DigitSeis is a new open-source, interactive digitization software written in MATLAB that converts digital, raster images of analog seismograms to readily usable, discretized time series using image processing algorithms. DigitSeis automatically identifies and corrects for various geometrical distortions of seismogram images that are acquired through the original recording, storage, and scanning procedures. With human supervision, the software further identifies and classifies important features such as time marks and notes, corrects time-mark offsets from the main trace, and digitizes the combined trace with an analysis to obtain as accurate timing as possible. Although a large effort has been made to minimize the human input, DigitSeis provides interactive tools for challenging situations such as trace crossings and stains in the paper. The effectiveness of the software is demonstrated with the digitization of seismograms that are over half a century old from the Harvard-Adam Dziewoński observatory that is still in operation as a part of the Global Seismographic Network (station code HRV and network code IU). The spectral analysis of the digitized time series shows no spurious features that may be related to the occurrence of minute and hour marks. They also display signals associated with significant earthquakes, and a comparison of the spectrograms with modern recordings reveals similarities in the background noise.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing need for increased integration across the data and model resources that are disseminated on the web to advance their reuse across different earth science applications. Meaningful reuse of resources requires semantic metadata to realize the semantic web vision for allowing pragmatic linkage and integration among resources. Semantic metadata associates standard metadata with resources to turn them into semantically-enabled resources on the web. However, the lack of a common standardized metadata framework as well as the uncoordinated use of metadata fields across different geo-information systems, has led to a situation in which standards and related Standard Names abound. To address this need, we have designed SAS to provide a bridge between the core ontologies required to annotate resources and information systems in order to enable queries and analysis over annotation from a single environment (web). SAS is one of the services that are provided by the Geosematnic framework, which is a decentralized semantic framework to support the integration between models and data and allow semantically heterogeneous to interact with minimum human intervention. Here we present the design of SAS and demonstrate its application for annotating data and models. First we describe how predicates and their attributes are extracted from standards and ingested in the knowledge-base of the Geosemantic framework. Then we illustrate the application of SAS in annotating data managed by SEAD and annotating simulation models that have web interface. SAS is a step in a broader approach to raise the quality of geoscience data and models that are published on the web and allow users to better search, access, and use of the existing resources based on standard vocabularies that are encoded and published using semantic technologies.",

            "abstract": "The Greater Blue Earth River Basin (GBERB), a tributary to the Minnesota River, produces very large loads of suspended sediment. Most of the watershed is flat, poorly drained, till and glacial lake deposit that are now almost entirely in row crops with pervasive subsurface drainage tiling. The lower part of the watershed is deeply incised in response to a baselevel fall of 60 m on the Minnesota River. Agricultural conversion of the uplands in the past 200 years is correlated with accelerated sediment delivery from the watershed. The balance of sediment sources has shifted from field erosion to near-channel erosion with the advent of soil conservation and increased river discharge over the past 70 years. Solution of the sediment loading problem will require some combination of direct reduction in sediment erosion and reduction in peak river discharges via distributed water storage.\nTo support decision-making by watershed stakeholders, we developed a watershed simulation model to evaluate reductions in GBERB sediment loading in response to different water and sediment management. The model uses a reduced complexity approach to (i) provide real-time evaluation of model uncertainty, (ii) accommodate existing information from soil mapping, stream gaging, sediment fingerprinting, and high-resolution topography, and (iii) incorporate near-channel sediment supply, which is the largest source of sediment and is not adequately represented by other watershed models. We apply a topographic filter to spatially distribute information on sediment sources to quantify the fraction of sediment sources delivered to the watershed outlet. A corresponding sediment delivery ratio is then used to discount reductions in sediment erosion from management actions. We use stream gaging records to develop a relation between peak river discharges and sediment loading from near-channel sources. This relation is used to indicate the reduction in sediment supply from upland water storage and reduce peak flows through the incised valleys in the lower watershed. The model uses as input the extent and effectiveness of management actions to reduce soil erosion, store water to reduce river peak flows, and directly address sediment inputs from near-channel sources.",

            "abstract": "As a major element, magnesium is of interest for investigating large scale processes governing the formation and evolution of rocky planetary bodies. Determining the Mg isotope composition of the Earth and other planetary bodies has hence been a topic of interest ever since mass-dependent fractionation of ‘non-traditional’ stable isotopes has been used to study high-temperature processes.\nPublished results, however, suffer from disagreement on the Mg isotope compositions of the Earth and chondrites [1-5], which is attributed to residual matrix effects. Nonetheless, most recent studied have converged towards a homogeneous (chondritic) Mg isotope composition in the Solar System [2-5].\nHowever, in several of the recent studies there is a hint of a systematic difference of about 0.02-0.06‰ in the 26Mg/24Mg isotope compositions of chondrites and Earth. Such difference, however, is only resolvable by taking standard errors, which assumes robust data for homogenous sample sets. The discrepancies between various studies unfortunately undermine the confidence in such robustness and homogeneity.\nThe issues with matrix effects during isotopic analyses can be overcome by using a double spike approach. Such methodology generally requires three isotope ratios to solve for three unknowns, a requirement that cannot be met for Mg. However, using a newly developed approach, we present Mg isotope compositions obtained by critical mixture double spiking. This new approach should allow greater confidence in the robustness of the data and hence enable improvement of.\nPreliminary data indicate that chondrites have a resolvable ~0.04‰ lighter 26Mg/24Mg than (ultra)mafic rocks from Earth, Mars and the eucrite parent body, which appear indistinguishable from each other. It seems implausible that this difference is caused by magmatic process such as partial melting or crystallisation. More likely, Mg isotopes are fractionated by a non-magmatic process during the formation of planets, e.g. by vapour-condensate fractionation.\n[1] Wiechert and Halliday, 2007. EPSL 256, 360-371.

            "abstract": "Low-lying coastal landscapes are at risk as sea level rises. Future projections suggest that 50 cm to 100 cm sea-level rise is imminent by the end of the century. One of the responses to increasing sea level is salt-water intrusion of freshwater-dependent ecosystems with long-term negative impacts on ecosystem services. This effect is further exacerbated by the presence of human-modified artificial drainages, which serve as gateways through which salt water penetrates inland areas. We present a novel conceptual model to investigate the vulnerability of low-lying, freshwater-dependent landscapes to saltwater intrusion. The saltwater intrusion vulnerability index (SIVI) is determined by the ratio of protected elevation above sea level to the log transformed local drainage area as a proxy for freshwater subsidies. As an index, SIVI represents the balance between vulnerability to salt-water exposure on one hand and the potential for freshwater flushing on the other. To this end, we use a high resolution Lidar-derived digital elevation model (DEM) to derive protected elevation, whereas the local drainage area is derived using a downscaled 100-m DEM to reflect the natural drainage and flushing potential in the absence of man-made structures. Thus, SIVI will serve as a guiding tool to determine the potential for salt-water intrusion, initially in coastal North Carolina, but eventually in similarly low-lying coastal regions. It will also aid understanding of the natural and human influences on observed patterns of salt-water intrusion and subsequent implications for ecosystem productivity, biodiversity and associated ecological processes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract:\nThe quantification of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions in models, continues to be a challenge (IPCC, 2013). In this scenario two-moment bulk microphysical scheme is used to understand the aerosol-cloud interactions in the regional model COSMO (Consortium for Small Scale Modeling). The two-moment scheme in COSMO has been especially designed to represent aerosol effects on the microphysics of mixed-phase clouds (Seifert et al., 2006). To improve the model predictability, the radiation scheme has been coupled with two-moment microphysical scheme. Further, the cloud microphysics parameterization has been modified via coupling COSMO with MUSCAT (MultiScale Chemistry Aerosol Transport model, Wolke et al., 2004). In this study, we will be discussing the initial result from the online-coupled COSMO-MUSCAT model system with modified two-moment parameterization scheme along with COSP (CFMIP Observational Simulator Package) satellite simulator. This online coupled model system aims to improve the sub-grid scale process in the regional weather prediction scenario. The constant aerosol concentration used in the Seifert and Beheng, (2006) parameterizations in COSMO model has been replaced by aerosol concentration derived from MUSCAT model. The cloud microphysical process from the modified two-moment scheme is compared with stand-alone COSMO model. To validate the robustness of the model simulation, the coupled model system is integrated with COSP satellite simulator (Muhlbauer et al., 2012). Further, the simulations are compared with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) satellite products.",

Programs that partner graduate students with K-12 educators serve the dual purpose of training future educators and providing K-12 students with unique opportunities and perspectives. The benefits of this type of partnership include providing students with enhanced educational experiences and positive student-mentor relationships, training STEM graduate students in effective teaching strategies, and providing teachers with a firsthand resource for scientific information and novel educational materials. Many high school students have had little exposure to science beyond the classroom. Frequent interactions with “real-life” scientists can help make science more approachable and is an effective strategy for promoting science as a career.\nHere I describe my experiences and several lessons designed as a NSK GK-12 fellow. For example, a month-long unit on biogeochemical principles was framed as a crime scene investigation of a fish kill event in Hood Canal, Washington, in which students were given additional pieces of evidence to solve the mystery as they satisfied checkpoints in their understanding of key concepts. The evidence pieces included scientific plots, maps, datasets, and laboratory exercises. A clear benefit of this investigation-style unit is that students were able to learn the material at their individual pace. This structure allowed for a streamlined integration of differentiated materials such as simplified background readings or visual learning aids for struggling students or more detailed news articles and primary literature for more advanced students.\nAlthough the NSF GK-12 program has been archived, educators and researchers should pursue new partnerships, leveraging local and state-level STEM outreach programs with the goal of increasing national exposure of the societal benefits of such synergistic activities.",

            "abstract": "As part of the CMIP5 experiments, many climate models incorporated new gridded products of land-use and land-use change that were harmonized to ensure a continuous transition from the historical to the future data in a consistent format for all models (Hurtt et al. 2011). These Land-Use Harmonization (LUH) data products include all annual transitions between cropland, pasture, urban and natural land, including wood harvest, shifting cultivation, and the recovery of secondary vegetation at half-degree (fractional) spatial resolution; these transitions are then used by climate models to compute the climate forcings associated with both historical and future land-use change. The next generation of LUH products is currently under development and has been selected as an official required forcing dataset for upcoming CMIP6 experiments. At the same time, satellite remote sensing of the terrestrial biosphere has also evolved; new NASA remote-sensing-based maps of global forest extent and change are now available (Hansen et al. 2013) and can be used as an added constraint in the LUH process. Harmonizing this remote sensing data with the LUH data generates new gridded maps of land-use transitions that are based on, and consistent with, observations of actual forest cover change and which can be used in coupled carbon-climate simulations to improve the representation of land-use related climate forcings. This is a major computational challenge involving 143 billion 30m Landsat pixels, and the simulation of over 20 billion LUH unknowns, in addition to challenges arising from the differing treatment of forested area in the observed and simulated data. The incorporation of this remote sensing data has lead to the development of new algorithms to better represent anthropogenic forest disturbance in the LUH, particularly for shifting cultivation and wood harvesting which are key sources of spatial uncertainty in the LUH forest extent and change maps. This not only further improves fidelity with the remote sensing data during the contemporary time period, but also improves the LUH historical reconstructions and future projections. These algorithms will be a key feature of the new LUH datasets being produced as part of the LUMIP for the CMIP6 experiments.",

            "abstract": "General Circulation Models (GCM) play an important role in assessing the impacts of climate change at global scale; however, coarser resolution limits their direct application at regional scale. To understand the climate variability at regional scale, different downscaling techniques (such as dynamical and statistical) have been developed which use the GCM outputs as boundary condition to produce finer resolution climate projections. Although, both dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques have proven to be able to capture the climate variability at regional scale; there are certain uncertainties lying in their projections especially for a region like India which have complex terrain and climatic pattern. Here, the uncertainties, resulting from the use of multiple GCM and downscaling models, are quantified with the assessment of impacts on regional crop yield. Two crop models with different complexity-Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) and Infocrop, are used, forced by dynamically (CORDEX, COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment) and statistically (Kannan and Ghosh, 2011; Salvi et al., 2013) downscaled data derived from multiple GCM’s. Advantage of these crop models is their ability to capture complexity of Indian condition. Yields of major crops in India, such as, rice, wheat and maize have been considered in the crop model and the impacts of climate change are assessed on their yields. The uncertainties in projected crop yields are also quantified, which must be incorporated for deriving vulnerability and risk maps for crop-climate assessments. This may further help to determine different crop management practices in order to reduce adverse impacts of climate change in future.",

            "abstract": "In the past, significant research efforts have been directed towards understanding how severe geomagnetic storms affect the near-Earth space environment. From this research, we have learned that many technologies are affected by these severe space weather events. The 2015 St. Patrick's Day geomagnetic storm has provided a great opportunity to analyze three selected space weather phenomena that adversely impact modern technologies; (1) Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs), (2) increased thermospheric mass density, and (3) the occurrence of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs).\nThe serious effects of GICs on power grids in the high-latitude regions is well known. Recent research has indicated that the equatorial region is also susceptible to increased GIC activity due to the equatorial electrojet. Thus, an examination of the equatorial magnetometer data during the St. Patrick's Day storm will be presented.\nIt is also well understood that during geomagnetic storms, the thermospheric mass density at a given altitude increases due to the increase in Joule heating in the high-latitude regions. As a consequence of this, low-Earth orbiting satellites and space debris experience increased atmospheric drag. Changes in atmospheric drag causes orbits to be perturbed, resulting in less accurate orbit predictions. An investigation of the orbits of several low-Earth orbiting satellites will be presented and discussed in the context of collision avoidance, as part of the ongoing space debris problem.\nFinally, Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) are a common phenomenon in the nighttime low-latitude ionosphere. EPBs are known to cause random fluctuations (i.e., scintillations) in the amplitude and phase of trans-ionospheric radio signals. While EPBs have been reported during both geomagnetically quiet and disturbed periods, research clearly indicates that the occurrence of EPBs is dependent on the geomagnetic activity level. The occurrence of EPBs around the world will be presented using data from both ground- and space-based EPB detection platforms. The results will be interpreted in the context of the disturbed ionosphere-thermosphere state and the subsequent impacts on the Generalized Rayleigh-Taylor plasma instability during the St. Patrick's Day storm.",

One platform to reach audiences outside the science community is through museum displays on 'Science on a Sphere' (SOS). Developed by NOAA, SOS is a giant globe, linked with computers and multiple projectors and can display data and animations on a sphere.\nCSDMS has developed and contributed model simulation datasets for the SOS system since 2014, including hydrological processes, coastal processes, and human interactions with the environment. Model simulations of a hydrological and sediment transport model (WBM-SED) illustrate global river discharge patterns. WAVEWATCH III simulations have been specifically processed to show the impacts of hurricanes on ocean waves, with focus on hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy. A large world dataset of dams built over the last two centuries gives an impression of the profound influence of humans on water management. Given the exposure of SOS, CSDMS aims to contribute at least 2 model datasets a year, and will soon provide displays of global river sediment fluxes and changes of the sea ice free season along the Arctic coast.\nOver 100 facilities worldwide show these numerical model displays to an estimated 33 million people every year. Datasets storyboards, and teacher follow-up materials associated with the simulations, are developed to address common core science K-12 standards. CSDMS dataset documentation aims to make people aware of the fact that they look at numerical model results, that underlying models have inherent assumptions and simplifications, and that limitations are known. CSDMS contributions aim to familiarize large audiences with the use of numerical modeling as a tool to create understanding of environmental processes.",

Rapid development of hydropower, accompanied by new and improved road networks, has resulted in swift changes in land-use and land cover in Ecuador’s tropical Andes, all of which underscore the need for detailed information on flow and sediment production from these river systems. National and regional payment for the protection of ecosystem services (PES) programs seek to target critical areas, such as these, for watershed conservation, but are often informed by minimal information on sustainable flows and impacts of land use activities. As part of a program to inform conservation and sustainable water management in the region, we established a hydrological monitoring station in southern Ecuador on the Mazar River, a tributary of the Paute River Basin, situated on the eastern Andean cordillera. The station is equipped with sensors to continuously monitor stream stage and turbidity and an automated sampler for event-based collection of stream water samples, providing high frequency data that reduces the uncertainty of observations. Here, we report observations of continuous runoff and turbidity over the first year of observation, present relationships between turbidity and concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and total particulate phosphorus (TP), and provide estimates of annual loads of TSS and TP. Runoff was highly variable over the monitoring period with flows ranging from less than 3 m3/s during baseflow to nearly 80 m3/s during the flood of record. During measured storm events, TSS exceeded 1000 mg/l with maximum measured concentrations exceeding 13 g/l during storm peaks. Turbidity was highly correlated with TSS, which was in turn highly correlated with TP, providing a robust data set for load estimation. We compare our results to other montane rivers in the tropical Andes and comment on the value of high frequency monitoring for load estimation. Our results provide important information for downstream hydropower operators on flow variability and demonstrate the importance of extreme events in the annual export of sediment and sediment-bound phosphorus in this system.",

            "abstract": "The C.E. 1707 Hōei event is often considered the worst-case scenario for a Nankai Trough earthquake and tsunami impacting southwestern Japan, and recent estimates of the earthquake’s magnitude have exceeded MW 9. However, when paired with tsunami simulations, previously published earthquake models for the event fail to match sedimentological and historical records of 1707 tsunami height in Shikoku and Kyushu. Specifically, models do not produce a sufficiently large tsunami in the northern Bungo Channel and Seto Inland Sea without also over-predicting tsunami heights along the open Pacific coastlines of Shikoku and Kyushu. Here, we apply a newly developed rupture model that uses present-day patterns of geodetically imaged interseismic coupling to inform patterns in coseismic slip. Along the southwestern extent of the plate interface (the Hyuga-nada area), there is a region of weak coupling up-dip along the trench axis and a region of strong coupling down-dip beneath Shikoku and Kyushu. Following this pattern, the new earthquake model produces less coseismic uplift offshore and greater subsidence in an inland region that includes the Bungo Channel. This combination of regional subsidence and a tsunami wave more focused to the Bungo Channel results in inundation patterns more consistent with historical and sedimentological observations in the Hyuga-nada area. We also run the tsunami simulation on a high-resolution grid around Lake Ryuuoo, a back-barrier lake in the northern Bungo Channel that contains a marine overwash deposit from the 1707 tsunami. We apply a simple sediment transport model to demonstrate that the coupling-based rupture scenario produces flow over Lake Ryuuoo’s barrier capable of transporting the maximum grain size observed in the lake’s 1707 deposit. These findings suggest that spatial trends in our present-day coupling model are more consistent with inundation patterns observed for large tsunamis generated by coseismic rupture along the Nankai Trough.",

            "abstract": "To create a framework for adapting to climate change, decision makers operating at the urban-wildland interface need to define climate vulnerabilities in the context of site-specific opportunities and constraints relative to water supply, land use suitability, wildfire risks, ecosystem services and quality of life. Pepperwood’s TBC3.org is crafting customized climate vulnerability assessments with selected water and natural resource agencies of California’s Sonoma, Marin, Napa and Mendocino counties under the auspices of Climate Ready North Bay, a public-private partnership funded by the California Coastal Conservancy. Working directly with managers from the very start of the process to define resource-specific information needs, we are developing high-resolution, spatially-explicit data products to help local governments and agency staff implement informed and effective climate adaptation strategies.\n Key preliminary findings for the region using the USGS’ Basin Characterization Model (at a 270 m spatial resolution) include a unidirectional trend, independent of greater or lesser precipitation, towards increasing climatic water deficits across model scenarios. Therefore a key message is that managers will be facing an increasingly arid environment. Companion models translate the impacts of shifting climate and hydrology on vegetation composition and fire risks. The combination of drought stress on water supplies and native vegetation with an approximate doubling of fire risks may demand new approaches to watershed planning. Working with agencies we are exploring how to build capacity for protection and enhancement of key watershed functions with a focus on groundwater recharge, facilitating greater drought tolerance in forest and rangeland systems, and considering more aggressive approaches to management of fuel loads. Lessons learned about effective engagement include the need for extended in-depth dialog, translation of key climate adaptation questions into deliverable metrics and indicators, and the need to take time to digest and formulate results in terms of adaptive management actions. Agencies also express a benefit in using Climate Ready results to raise public awareness of the resource challenges that may lay ahead.",

            "abstract": "Arctic tundra vegetation has generally exhibited a “greening” trend for at least the past three decades. However, these temporal trends in tundra vegetation are highly heterogeneous in space across different arctic regions, as well as showing variability over time. The factors controlling this variability are likely numerous with complex interactions, however, a first approach is to examine how vegetation dynamics relate to trends in temperature. We used a 32-year record (1982-2013) of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperatures from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors onboard NOAA satellites (GIMMS 3g dataset) to analyze observed changes in both aboveground tundra vegetation and surface temperatures. We divided the circumpolar dataset into two continental regions (North America and Eurasia), as well as by tundra subzone (A-E) sensu the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM). We 1) compared temporal trends in both MaxNDVI (peak values) and TI-NDVI (seasonally integrated values) with those of the Summer Warmth Index (SWI – sum of mean monthly temperatures > 0 °C); 2) assessed how the detrended interannual variabilities in NDVI compared to those of SWI; and 3) analyzed current and prior year SWI, as well as prior year NDVI, as controls on current year NDVI. Interannual coefficients of variation for SWI were 2.0 – 2.5 times greater than those for NDVI, and the temporal trendlines for NDVI were much “tighter” with greater r² values than those for SWI. Interannual variability in NDVI was greatest in the “Mid-Low” Arctic, whereas interannual variability in SWI was greatest in the most southern Arctic. Surprisingly, the observed relative rates of change in NDVI were greater than those of SWI for the warmer subzones for both North America and Eurasia. Finally, the change in NDVI from one year to the next was only weakly correlated with current year SWI. These results suggest that 1) there are clearly factors other than temperature that are yielding high vegetation biomass responses, 2) the responses of arctic tundra vegetation to temperature, and the interannual variabilities of vegetation and temperature, differ between continents and among tundra subzones, and 3) interannual variability in temperature is a weak control of interannual variability in vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Dehydration of subducting plates should hydrate the shallow overlying mantle wedge where mantle is cold. In the shallow mantle wedge hydrous phases, notably serpentines, chlorite, brucite and talc should be stable to form a significant reservoir for H2O. Beneath this cold nose thermal models suggest only limited slab dehydration occurs at depths less than ca. 80 km except in warm subduction zones, but fluids may flow updip from deeper within the subducting plate to hydrate the shallow mantle. We estimate the total water storage capacity in cold noses, at temperatures where hydrous phases are stable, to be roughly 2-3% the mass of the global ocean. At modern subduction flux rates its full hydration could be achieved in 50-100 Ma if all subducting water devolatilized in the upper 100 km flows into the wedge; these estimates have at least a factor of two uncertainty.\nTo investigate the extent to which wedge hydration actually occurs we compile and generate seismic images of forearc mantle regions. The compilation includes P- and S-velocity images with good sampling below the Moho and above the downgoing slab in forearcs, from active-source imaging, local earthquake tomography and receiver functions, while avoiding areas of complex tectonics. Well-resolved images exist for Cascadia, Alaska, the Andes, Central America, North Island New Zealand, and Japan. We compare the observed velocities to those predicted from thermal-petrologic models. Among these forearcs, Cascadia stands out as having upper-mantle seismic velocities lower than overriding crust, consistent with high (>50%) hydration. Most other forearcs show Vp close to 8.0 km/s and Vp/Vs of 1.73-1.80. We compare these observations to velocities predicted from thermal-mineralogical models. Velocities are slightly slower than expected for dry peridotite and allow 10-20% hydration, but also could also be explained as relict accreted rock, or delaminated, relaminated, or offscraped crustal material mixed with mantle. The absence of wholesale hydration of forearcs globally can be taken as evidence that most forearcs are too young to be substantially hydrated, that most subducted water bypasses the forearc and is released deeper, or that most fluid passing through the mantle nose does not react with the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Many factors contribute to the quality of airborne gravity data measured with LaCoste and Romberg-type sensors, such as the Micro-g LaCoste Turnkey Airborne Gravity System used by the National Geodetic Survey’s GRAV-D (Gravity for the Redefinition of the American Vertical Datum) Project. For example, it is well documented that turbulence is a big factor in the overall noise level of the measurement. Turbulence is best controlled by avoidance; thus flights in the GRAV-D Project are only undertaken when the predicted wind speeds at flight level are ≤ 40 kts. Tail winds are known to be particularly problematic.\nThe GRAV-D survey operates on a number of aircraft in a variety of wind conditions and geographic locations, and an obvious conclusion from our work to date is that the aircraft itself plays an enormous role in the quality of the airborne gravity measurement. We have identified a number of features of the various aircraft which can be determined to play a role: the autopilot, the size and speed of the aircraft, inherent motion characteristics of the airframe, tip tanks and other modifications to the airframe to reduce motion, to name the most important. This study evaluates the motion of a number of the GRAV-D aircraft and looks at the correlation between this motion and the noise characteristics of the gravity data. The GRAV-D Project spans 7 years and 42 surveys, so we have a significant body of data for this evaluation. Throughout the project, the sensor suite has included an inertial measurement unit (IMU), first the Applanix POSAv, and then later the Honeywell MicroIRS IMU as a part of a NovAtel SPAN GPS/IMU system. We compare the noise characteristics of the data with measures of aircraft motion (via pitch, roll, and yaw captured by the IMU) using a variety of statistical tools. It is expected that this comparison will support the conclusion that certain aircraft tend to work well with this type of gravity sensor while others tend to be problematic in general.",

            "abstract": "The great promise of Virtual Observatories is the ability to perform complex search operations across the metadata of a large variety of different data sets. This allows the researcher to isolate and select the relevant measurements for their topic of study.\nThe Virtual ITM Observatory (VITMO) has many diverse geophysical datasets that cover a large temporal and spatial range that present a unique search problem. VITMO provides many methods by which the user can search for and select data of interest including restricting selections based on geophysical conditions (solar wind speed, Kp, etc) as well as finding those datasets that overlap in time. One of the key challenges in improving discoverability is the ability to identify portions of datasets that overlap in time and in location. The difficulty is that location data is not contained in the metadata for datasets produced by satellites and would be extremely large in volume if it were available, making searching for overlapping data very time consuming.\nTo solve this problem we have developed a series of light-weight web services that can provide a new data search capability for VITMO and others. The services consist of a database of spacecraft ephemerides and instrument fields of view; an overlap calculator to find times when the fields of view of different instruments intersect; and a magnetic field line tracing service that maps in situ and ground based measurements to the equatorial plane in magnetic coordinates for a number of field models and geophysical conditions.\nThese services run in real-time when the user queries for data. These services will allow the non-specialist user to select data that they were previously unable to locate, opening up analysis opportunities beyond the instrument teams and specialists, making it easier for future students who come into the field.",

            "abstract": "The San Andres rift (SAR) is an active, 015°-trending, bathymetric and structural rift basin that extends for 346 km across the Nicaraguan platform and varies in bathymetric width from 11-27 km and in water depth from 1,250 to 2,500 m. We used four 2D regional seismic lines tied to two offshore, industry wells located west of the SAR on the Nicaraguan platform to map normal faults, transfer faults, and possibly volcanic features with the rift. The Colombian islands of San Andres (26 km2) and Providencia (17 km2) are footwall uplifts along west-dipping, normal fault bounding the eastern margin of the rift. Mapping indicates the pre-rift section is Late Cretaceous to Oligocene in age and that the onset of rifting began in the early to middle Miocene as shown by wedging of the Miocene and younger sedimentary fill controlled by north-south-striking normal faults. Structural restorations at two locations across the rift shows that the basin opened mainly by dip-slip fault motions producing a total, east-west extension of 18 km in the north and 15 km in the south. Structural restoration shows the rift formed on a 37-km-wide, elongate basement high - possibly of late Cretaceous, volcanic origin and related to the Caribbean large igneous province. Previous workers have noted that the SAR is associated with province of Pliocene to Quaternary seamounts and volcanoes which range from non-alkaline to mildly alkaline, including volcanic rocks on Providencia described as andesites and rhyolites. The SAR forms one of the few recognizable belts of recorded seismicity within the Caribbean plate. The origin of the SAR is related to Miocene and younger left-lateral displacement along the Pedro Banks fault to the north and the southwestern Hess fault to the south. We propose that the amount of left-lateral displacement that created the rift is equivalent to the amount of extension that formed it: 18-20 km.",

However, we have a limited understanding of microbial metabolic processes such as nutrient uptake rates, substrate preferences, or how microbes and microbial metabolism are distributed throughout the three-dimensional pore network of the soil. Here we use a novel combination of imaging techniques with quantum dots (QDs, engineered semiconductor nanoparticles that produce size or composition-dependent fluorescence) to locate bacteria in the three-dimensional pore network of a soil aggregate. First, we show using confocal and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopies that bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas protogens) actively take up and internalize CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs conjugated to biologically relevant substrates. Next, we show that cells bearing QDs can be identified using fluorescence imaging with hard x-rays at 2ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Finally, we demonstrate that the Se constituent to the QDs can be used to label bacteria in three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions of natural soil at 0.5 nm spatial resolution using hard x-rays at 2ID-E at the APS. This is the first time soil bacteria have been imaged in the intact soil matrix at such high resolution. These results offer a new way to experimentally investigate basic bacterial ecology in situ, revealing constraints on microbial function in soil that will help improve connections between pore-scale and ecosystem-scale processes in models.",

A global daily analysis cannot be achieved with measurements made in situ alone, so incorporation of satellite retrievals is needed. To achieve this, we must develop an understanding of the relationships between traditional (land and marine) surface air temperature measurements and retrievals of surface skin temperature from satellite measurements, i.e. Land Surface Temperature, Ice Surface Temperature, Sea Surface Temperature and Lake Surface Water Temperature. These relationships can be derived either empirically or with the help of a physical model.\nHere we discuss the science needed to produce a fully-global daily analysis (or ensemble of analyses) of surface air temperature on the centennial scale, integrating different ground-based and satellite-borne data types. Information contained in the satellite retrievals would be used to create globally-complete fields in the past, using statistical models of how surface air temperature varies in a connected way from place to place. As the data volumes involved are considerable, such work needs to include development of new “Big Data” analysis methods.\nWe will present plans and progress along this road in the EUSTACE project (2015-June 2018), i.e.: \n• providing new, consistent, multi-component estimates of uncertainty in surface skin temperature retrievals from satellites; \n• identifying inhomogeneities in daily surface air temperature measurement series from weather stations and correcting for these over Europe; \n• estimating surface air temperature over all surfaces of Earth from surface skin temperature retrievals; \n• using new statistical techniques to provide information on higher spatial and temporal scales than currently available, making optimum use of information in data-rich eras.\nInformation will also be given on how interested users can become involved.",

            "abstract": "The Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) is an international continental scale effort led by Brazil to understand how land use change and climate change affects the role of Amazonia in the Earth system. During the first decade of studies (1998-2007), LBA researchers generated new understanding of Amazonia and published over 1000 papers. However, most LBA participants agree that training and education of a large cohort of scientists, especially students from Brazil, was the greatest contribution of LBA. I analyzed bibliographic data from the NASA supported component project known as LBA-ECO. This component covered a large cross-section of the LBA subject areas highlighting land use and land cover change, carbon cycling, nutrient cycling and other aspects of terrestrial and aquatic ecology. I reviewed the complete bibliography of peer-reviewed papers reported by LBA-ECO researchers (\nhttp://www.lbaeco.org/cgi-bin/web/investigations/lbaeco_refs.pl\n). The researchers reported 691 contributions from 1996 through 2013 of which 24 were theses that were removed them from further analysis. Of 667 papers and book chapters, I tallied the first authors separating categories for Brazilians, all students, and Brazilian students. Numerically, LBA-ECO production of papers peaked in 2004. Publication by Brazilians, students, and Brazilian students generally followed the same pattern as publication in general. However, student and Brazilian student contributions as first authors showed clearly increasing proportions of the papers from project initiation through peak publication. Brazilian student participation as first authors averaged more than 20% of all publications from 2003 to 2010 and more than half of all student publications had Brazilians as first authors. Foreign researchers, some initially reluctant to invest in Brazilian students, almost universally adapted the belief that the greatest legacy of LBA would be the contribution to building a cadre of environmental researchers and professionals for the Amazon region. This belief was transformed into a commitment through pressure by NASA management and through the leadership of the LBA-ECO research team leading to LBA’s greatest legacy.",

A Global Navigation Satellite System network, KivuGNet (Kivu Geodetic Network), has operated since 2009 for monitoring and research of the deformation of Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo volcanoes as well as tectonic deformation in the region. We detected an inflationary signal from the position time series observed in the network using our detection method, which is a combination of Kalman filtering and principal component analysis. The inflation occurred in October 2010 and lasted for about 6 months prior to the 2011 eruption at Nyamulagira volcano. The pre-eruptive inflationary signal is much weaker than the co-eruptive signal, but our method successfully detected the signal. The maximum horizontal and vertical displacements observed are ~14 mm and ~10 mm, respectively. A Mogi point source at a depth > 10 km can explain the displacement field suggesting a relatively deep source for the magma chamber. Continuous monitoring of the volcanic activity is essential for understanding the eruption cycle and assessing potential volcanic hazards.",

Mantle derived chromium-bearing spinel suggests that its high pressure phase may be existing at deep mantle but however its high pressure elastic property is not well understood yet. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies of magnesiochromite and chromite using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell were performed at GSECARS, Advanced Photon Source, to explore their high pressure phases and elastic property. Our results on magnesiochromite showed dissociation of MgCr2O4 to Cr2O3+MgO at ~15 GPa and to modified Ludwigite (mLd)-type Mg2Cr2O5+Cr2O3 below and above ~1500 K, respectively. At above 20 GPa, only a single phase CaTi2O4-type structure of MgCr2O4 was observed at 1400-2000 K. Pressure-volume data of CaTi2O4 type structure of MgCr2O4 fitted to Birch-Murnaghan equation of state yield zero-pressure volume (V0) = 264.4(8) Å3, bulk modulus (K0) = 185.4(4) GPa, and pressure derivative (K0’) = 4; and mLd-type Mg2Cr2O5 yields: V0 = 338.9(8) Å3, K0 = 186.5(6) GPa, K0’ = 4. For CaTi2O4 type structure of natural chromite, our fitted P-V data show V0 = 261(1) Å3, K0 = 175.4(2) GPa, and K0’ = 4.",

            "abstract": "This research quantified long-run hydrological persistence in two important regions for the California water supply system using a relatively new approach in hydrology, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). EMD is a user-adaptive method that identifies non-stationary persistence, as Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), prevalent in hydrological data but often not represented in current water supply modeling. The primary objectives of this research included: 1) examination of variability, patterns of persistence, and the degree of cross-correlations among annual and monthly inflows in these two regions, 2) identification of potential sources of persistence in inflows, particularly modes of climate variability, and 3) to provide water supply managers with suggestions to incorporate these methods into water supply modeling. Results indicate that inflows are highly variable, highly cross-correlated within each region and between the two regions, and moderately correlated to long-run patterns of persistence. Average annual IMF periodicities of >10 years contributed to a considerable amount of variance in annual inflows for the two regions (27.05% and 14.92% for the Oroville and Shasta/Trinity inflows, respectively) and exhibited the strongest moderate (on average 0.50) correlations to climate IMFs of similar length. Monthly correlations of inflows to climate indices were generally weak, but also exhibited the strongest correlations in IMFs with average periodicities of >10 years. This research underscores the need to utilize uncorrelated sources of water, such as desalination, into water management plans and to incorporate long-run persistence into water supply scenario modeling to increase reliability, especially during prolonged periods of hydrologic downturns. The EMD analytical method is a powerful and approachable tool that can be adapted for water supply managers to use as a precursor to this future scenario modeling.",

            "abstract": "The sources of ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the Alberta oil sands (OS) region have not previously been well characterized. In the summer of 2013, airborne measurements of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO2+NO) and ozone were made in the Athabasca OS region between August 13 and September 7, 2013. Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and whole air samples were used to measure VOCs. A box model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3), was constrained by measured chemical species and meteorological parameters and used to simulate the evolution of an OS plume. In doing so, an improved understanding of the chemical factors controlling the radical budget and the evolution of ozone in oil sands plumes is achieved. Our results indicate that approximately 20% of the in-plume generated OH radicals are derived from primary sources (HCHO, O3 and HONO photolysis). The remaining OH is derived from the recycling of hydroperoxyl radical (HO2). The HO2 and alkyl peroxyl radical (RO2) chemistry leads to 35% of the ozone formation in the plume, while the main sink for ozone in the plume was via reactions with alkenes (anthropogenic and biogenic). The results of this work will help to characterize ozone formation and the factors influencing its atmospheric fate in the oil sands region.",

            "abstract": "Many Asian large rivers originate from glaciers over the Tibetan Plateau. The changes of glaciers in this region have a significant impact on water supply. In recent years, the Karakoram Anomaly, i.e., the glaciers in Karakoram remained stable and even expanded in contrast to the receding of the glaciers nearby and worldwide, has attracted much attention. There have been many attempts to explain this phenomenon. In order to better understand the causes of this phenomenon, the spatial pattern of the variations of the glaciers in the whole Tibetan Plateau should be explored on a longer time scale. During the Little Ice Age (LIA), the glaciers over the Tibetan Plateau advanced and formed easily recognizable end and lateral moraines, which could be used to identify the extents of glaciers. Using remote sensing images and aerial photos, along with field works, we recognized the distributions of the LIA’s moraines of about 2000 glaciers over the Tibetan Plateau. It was found that the glacier areas have reduced by larger than 25% in the southeast Tibetan Plateau and the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau while less than 10% in the northwest Tibetan Plateau (including the Karakoram) since the LIA. A similar spatial pattern of the shrinkages of the glaciers was also revealed over the past decades. It’s noted that the summer freezing level is much higher than the glacier median elevation in the southeast Tibetan Plateau while much lower in the northwest Tibetan Plateau, and the summer freezing level showed a decreasing trend in the northwest Tibetan Plateau (including the Karakoram) while increasing in the southeast Tibetan Plateau over the past decades. These imply that the summer freezing level play an important role in the spatial variations of the glaciers over the Tibetan Plateau.",

We also recorded in situ temperatures of the water column based on probe (CTD) profiles. The δ18O and δ13C values measured in the core top samples matches with the tow results. The equilibrium δ18O of calcite calculated from known temperature and δ18O of water column allowed us to compare the observed δ18O of formaminieral shell with the expected equilibrium values. Our comparison of carbonate composition in the samples between 10°N till 40°S showed excellent match with the expected equilibrium δ18O values established from the water collected at depth range of ~75-200m, however beyond 40°S the disequilibrium was pronounced with heavier δ18O (enriched by ~1.5‰) recorded in the carbonate as compared with the expected equilibrium δ18O values established from water. This observation was further verified with δ13C measurement of shell carbonates comparing with the equilibrium δ13C of calcite calculated with known temperature and δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column. The δ13C of the shell carbonate was found heavier as compared to the expected equilibrium δ13C. Both δ18O and δ13C showed simultaneous enrichment signature in the region beyond 40°S suggesting role of processes such as leaching along with dissolution of shell carbonate in a relatively acidic condition.",

The climate system is characterized by complex phenomena that are imperfectly observed and even more imperfectly simulated. Climate data is Big Data, yet the magnitude of data and climate model output increasingly overwhelms the tools currently used to analyze them. Computational innovation is therefore needed.\nMachine learning is a cutting-edge research area at the intersection of computer science and statistics, focused on developing algorithms for big data analytics. Machine learning has revolutionized scientific discovery (e.g. Bioinformatics), and spawned new technologies (e.g. Web search). The impact of machine learning on climate science promises to be similarly profound.\nThe goal of the novel interdisciplinary field of Climate Informatics is to accelerate discovery in climate science with machine learning, in order to shed light on urgent questions about climate change. In this talk, I will survey my research group’s progress in the emerging field of climate informatics. Our work includes algorithms to improve the combined predictions of the IPCC multi-model ensemble, applications to seasonal and subseasonal prediction, and a data-driven technique to detect and define extreme events.",

NCEP has developed coupled CFS (version 2, CFSv2) and carried out CFS reanalysis (CFSR), which includes a coupled model with the NCEP global forecast system, a land model, an ocean model (GFDL MOM4), and a sea ice model. In this work, we present the NCEP coupled model, the CFSv2 sea ice component that includes a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model and a simple “assimilation” scheme, how sea ice has been assimilated in CFSR, the characteristics of the sea ice from CFSR and CFSv2, and the improvements of sea ice needed for future CFS (version 3) and the CFSR.",

            "abstract": "Effective stress, defined as the load transmitted from particle to particle in the solid framework of a rock, plays a significant role in controlling mechanical compaction and thus reservoir quality in sandstones.\nMechanical compaction in sandstones takes place through rearrangement and ductile/ brittle deformation of framework grains during progressive burial. It is primarily dependent on the magnitude and evolution of effective stress during burial, and on the nature and textural properties of framework grains (mineralogy, grain size/shape, sorting…) and pore-filing solid cements when present.\nHere, we propose a method to directly evaluate maximum effective stress in sandstone reservoirs by quantifying the brittle deformation of quartz grains evidenced through the development of microfractures. Quartz microfracturing is documented and quantified by examining thin sections of core samples under SEM CL microscopy.\nPrevious published experimental studies and observations made on natural samples indicate that quartz burial-induced microfracturing in sandstones is mainly affected by effective stress, but also reflects other factors such as grain size, sorting and proportion of ductile grains (clays, micas…).\nIn order to investigate the quantitative impact of such factors altogether, we have conducted compaction experiments (>30 tests) on 10 types of sands at 25°C, under dry conditions and pressures up to 55 Mpa. The resulting compressed sands were studied by optical microscopy to quantify fractured quartz grains. Results were processed using R statistical computing language via a multi input model to define a simple equation that provides correction constants for each influencing factor. The resulting equation will then be used to calculate the maximum effective stress recorded by a sandstone reservoir during its burial history, based on the petrographic/mineralogical characteristics (thin section point-counting) and the fractured-grain ratio (obtained by SEM CL) of the sandstone.\nThe validity of the relationship between fractured-grain ratio and maximum paleo-effective stress will be tested on North Sea reservoirs covering a wide range of present pore pressure conditions.",

            "abstract": "In this study, the effect of climate change on temperature extremes over Turkey is investigated in high resolution climate model simulations driven by a global model outputs. MPI-ESM2 earth system model simulations are downscaled to first 50 km coarse resolution over Med-CORDEX domain and then 10 km high resolution over Turkey by regional climate model, RegCM4.3. The simulations cover the periods of 1970-2000 for the reference and 2015-2100 for the future with proposed changes under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) and 8.5 (RCP8.5).\nHigh resolution gridded surface climate dataset is of great value for the validation phase of the high resolution climate models and the daily temperature observations are interpolated to regular grids which coincide with the simulation’s grids by using PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) approach. High resolution regional climate model performance is evaluated for the reference period by using gridded observations for both averages and extremes of temperature. The RegCM coupled with MPI-ESM2 shows negative biases over most of Turkey. Hence monthly mean value bias correction is applied to temperature simulations of reference and 2015-2100 periods. Extreme temperature climate indices such as FD0, SU25, TX10p, TN10p, TX90p, TN90p, TX35, WSDI, CSDI and DTR are calculated and compared to reference period. Bias corrected high resolution simulations show good agreement with the observations.\nThe climate indices are calculated for the intervals of 2015-2040,2041-2070,2071-2100, for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. FD0, TN10p, TX10p and CSDI indices decrease through the end of century for both scenarios and the most dramatic changes occur on the eastern and central part of Turkey. The rate of decrease is more pronounced in RCP8.5 scenario. On the other hand, the indices of SU25, TX90p, TN90p, TX35 and WSDI increase till 2100. 30 year averages of SU25 and SU35 over all Turkey increase from 64 days and 7 days to 131 days and 29 for RCP4.5 and to 157 days and 51 for RCP8.5, respectively. However, the rate of change for warm climate indices does not show uniform distribution. Especially, the changes on the regions of southern Anatolia along the Aegean and Mediterranean Sea are large while there is almost no change on the regions along the Black Sea coast",

The ~6.2 Ma Risco Bayo and Huemul plutons in the Chilean Andes (~36°S) exhibit a similar compositional spectrum and footprint to the active Laguna del Maule rhyolitic volcanic field nearby. The plutons comprise distinct lithological domains-each on the order of a few km3: gabbro to granite in Risco Bayo and granodiorite to leucogranite in Huemul. Whole rock variations and 87Sr/86Sr ratios highlight the importance of AFC processes during pluton assembly. Mixing and mingling of magma batches is observed geochemically and in the field as abundant mafic enclaves. U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS zircon ages of 6.36 to 6.18 Ma in Risco Bayo granodiorite and Huemul miarolitic leucogranite overlap with their 40Ar/39Ar biotite ages of ~6.24 Ma, suggesting coeval zircon saturation, emplacement, and rapid cooling of two compositionally and structurally distinct domains. A granodiorite domain within Huemul has a more protracted crystallization history and zircons with lower REE than in the adjacent miarolitic leucogranite, suggesting pluton construction by pulses on 10 to 100 kyr timescales. Al-in-hornblende barometry constrains emplacement to 3-4 km depth. Observations from Laguna del Maule (extrusion/intrusion rates, spatio-temporal pattern of mafic/rhyolitic volcanism, etc.) provide volcanic parallels with which to help interpret pluton assembly. AMS fabrics suggest possible upward migration of magma associated with decompression. Late Miocene silicic ignimbrites nearby are also being investigated to determine if they represent erupted products from the Risco Bayo-Huemul plutonic system.",

            "abstract": "The boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates in NE Asia is ‘shifty.’ It is sometimes drawn through the Sea of Japan, sometimes through the Hokkaido axial zone, or not at all. The boundary may or may not extend through central Japan along the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL). How to explain this uncertainty? Geodetic models suggest that NE Japan moves independently from Eurasia, but the inferred plate boundary cannot be constrained geologically or seismologically. Available published data provides other constraints. A series of destructive (M>7) intraplate earthquakes in the Japan Sea with E-thrusting focal mechanisms was thought to be evidence of nascent subduction, but the 1983 Nihonkai-Chubu (M7.7) earthquake, was shown to have occurred on the boundary between thick oceanic crust and island-arc crust of central Japan. These earthquakes appear to result from reactivation of inherited structures that formed during back-arc opening, rather than from subduction. Furthermore, seismic images show no crustal discontinuities that could be interpreted as a plate boundary. As for the ISTL, available geological and seismological evidence indicates that the southern ISTL marks a W-dipping deformation boundary related to the collision of the Izu-Bonin arc with SW Japan (15 Ma). Although indented by the collision, the geological structure/basement of SW Japan are continuous across the ISTL, making it an unlikely plate boundary. The northern ISTL has a different origin, as an E-dipping boundary fault for a Neogene rift basin. The fault has been inactive in the late Quaternary and, again, does not constitute a major geological discontinuity in the basement. Hence, the problem: geodetic models imply a plate boundary between Japan and Eurasia, but published geological and seismological evidence does not support placing it in the Japan Sea or at the ISTL. If, as studies show, almost half of the convergence between North America and Eurasia is taken up in Hokkaido and across N Japan, the small amount of remaining convergence may be difficult to distinguish given the large elastic response in the upper plate (N Honshu) after the 2011 Tohoku-oki (M9.0) earthquake, and strong coupling at the megathrust. To draw such a plate boundary on tectonic maps implies a degree of certainty about its location which is unfounded.",

Achieving these levels of emissions reductions will require dramatic changes in the U.S. electricity generating infrastructure: almost all of the fossil-generation fleet will need to be replaced with low-carbon sources and society would have to maintain a high build rate of new capacity for decades. Because the build rate of new electricity generating capacity may be limited, the timing of regulation is critical—the longer the U.S. waits to start reducing emissions, the faster the turnover in the electricity sector must occur in order to meet the same target. We investigate the relationship between climate policy timing and infrastructure turnover in the electricity sector. How long can we wait before constraints on infrastructure turnover in the electricity sector make achieving our climate goals impossible? We show that delaying climate change policy increases average construction rates by 25% to 85% and increases maximum construction rates by 50% to 300%. We also show that delaying climate policy has little effect on the age of retired plants or the stranded costs associated with premature retirement. We show that as we delay policy action, some goals won’t be possible for attain. For example, unless we enable emissions reductions today, reducing cumulative emissions between now and 2040 by 50% when compared to a no-policy scenario is not possible.",

            "abstract": "Deep Convective Clouds (DCCs) have key role in the tropical region. Despite they only have small spatial coverage, but they account most of the total precipitation in these region which often make flooding. There are such of aviation accidents caused by strong vertical wind, hailing, icing and lightning inside the clouds. Pollutions caused by biomass burning and land degradation can change the aerosol properties as well as cloud properties, therefore will influence the radiation and formation of the DCCs. Those are the major reasons that better understanding of DCCs formation and life cycle are necessary.\nBetween Sept. 01 – Oct. 14, ACRIDICON (Aerosol, Cloud, Precipitation, and Radiation Interactions and Dynamics of Concevtive Clouds Systems) campaign was conducted over Amazonia. It is suitable area to be the site-study due to has strong contrast environtment (pristine and polluted), regular convection activities and stable meteorological condition. In this study we focus on the 2 satellite validation missions designed to fly collocated but in different altitude with A-TRAIN constellation. In order to study DCCs-solar radiation interaction, we use SMART (Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation Measurements System) installed on HALO (High Altitude and Long-Range Research Aircraft) which measures spectral Irradiance (F) and Radiance (I) at the wavelength between 300–2200 nm corresponding to satellite. Due to the limitation in spatial and temporal, airborne measurements only give snapshots of atmosphere condition and DCCs formation, therefore we use multi-satellite data as DCCs have high vertical and horizontal distance, long temporal development and complex form.\nThe comparison of AQUA MODIS and SMART Radiance at 645 nm (non-absorbing) in the clear-sky condition gives strong agreement, but in the multilayer-cloud condition gives worse and results in high underestimation (-86%) in SMART data especially at lower altitude. The bias is caused by interference from clouds above flight which can be observed by CLOUDSAT. High surface reflectivity (over land) and 3D effect become the challenges since they have strong influence for the radiation measurement in this case. Finally, using GOES-13 at visible wavelength in 30 minutes temporal resolution obviously can depict DCCs evolution and phase transition.",

            "abstract": "Climate reconstructions based on tree-ring variability at an individual site are typically based on measurements from 20-100 trees. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, reconstructions are typically based on the mean tree-ring growth across all timeseries. However, there is the possibility that individual trees respond somewhat differently to growing conditions and that additional information exists within a given collection of tree-ring growth records beyond the mean. We begin by comparing timeseries of mean detrended tree-ring width variability to timeseries of the standard deviation, and higher moments of tree-ring width across individual tree-ring series for stations in the International Tree-Ring Databank. Strong correlations exist between mean tree-ring growth and the standard deviation of tree-ring growth across records, indicating that variability in tree-ring width in a given year is not normally distributed. Non-normally distributed tree ring responses to temperature, for example, implies that the distribution of tree-ring growth may record information about the distribution of temperature, in addition to the the mean growing season temperature. We evaluate the feasibility of reconstructing temperature distributions, with a focus on extreme high temperatures, by comparing the distribution of daily-resolution instrumental observations with the distribution of tree-ring growth records. Any progress herein has the potentially to generally increase the interpretability, and hence value, of tree ring chronologies.",

            "abstract": "Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) is a valuable paleoclimate resource due to the climatic sensitivity of its annually-resolved rings. Recent work has shown that low growing season temperatures limit tree growth at the upper treeline ecotone. The presence of precisely dated remnant wood above modern treeline shows that this ecotone shifts at centennial timescales; in some areas during the Holocene climatic optimum treeline was 100 m higher than at present. A recent model from Paulsen and Körner (2014, doi:10.1007/s00035-014-0124-0) predicts global potential treeline position as a function of climate. The model develops three parameters necessary to sustain a temperature-limited treeline; a growing season longer than 94 days, defined by all days with a mean temperature >0.9 °C, and a mean temperature of 6.4 °C across the entire growing season. While maintaining impressive global accuracy in treeline prediction, these parameters are not specific to the semi-arid Great Basin bristlecone pine treelines in Nevada. In this study, we used 49 temperature sensors arrayed across approximately one square kilometer of complex terrain at treeline on Mount Washington to model temperatures using topographic indices. Results show relatively accurate prediction throughout the growing season (e.g., July average daily temperatures were modeled with an R2 of 0.80 and an RMSE of 0.29 °C). The modeled temperatures enabled calibration of a regional treeline model, yielding different parameters needed to predict potential treeline than the global model. Preliminary results indicate that modern Bristlecone pine treeline on and around Mount Washington occurs in areas with a longer growing season length (~160 days defined by all days with a mean temperature >0.9 °C) and a warmer seasonal mean temperature (~9 °C) than the global average. This work will provide a baseline data set on treeline position in the Snake Range derived only from parameters physiologically relevant to demography, and may assist in understanding climate refugia for this species.",

            "abstract": "We are assessing variability in mercury species in porewater, groundwater, and surface water at Sage Lot saltmarsh along the south shore of Cape Cod, MA. This relatively undisturbed coastal marsh is part of the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Reserve and is surrounded by undeveloped wooded uplands. The marsh substrate is comprised of an organic-rich peat layer that reaches a maximum thickness of ~2 m at the water’s edge and overlays the regional sand groundwater aquifer. We collected porewater depth profiles within the peat layer along an approximately 120 m transect perpendicular to the shoreline (see figure). Total mercury (HgT) concentrations in porewater ranged from 2 to 6 pM in filtered (< 0.2 µm) water and from 10 to 20 pM in unfiltered water. Mercury concentrations in groundwater collected from a well installed about 20 m upgradient from the marsh were an order of magnitude higher (~ 130 pM and 170 pM in filtered and unfiltered water, respectively). Although ~70% of this mercury occurred in the presumably mobile (< 0.2 µm) fraction, the elevated groundwater concentrations did not appear to enhance HgT within the peat layer. Groundwater in sand immediately below the sand-peat interface, however, typically had HgT concentrations similar to those observed in peat, suggesting porewater infiltration to the underlying aquifer. We also collected time series surface water samples over tidal flooding and draining cycles. Filtered and unfiltered surface water HgT were similar to concentrations observed in peat porewater and did not change in response to the tidal cycle. Preliminary data suggests methylmercury (MeHg) in filtered porewater was about 1 pM (i.e., ~20% MeHg), indicating enhanced mercury methylation within the anoxic peat layer. If the similarity between peat porewater and marsh surface water HgT concentrations is a result of hydraulic exchange between the porewater and offshore water, the saltmarsh may be an important source of bioavailable mercury to the local ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "In Taiwan, groundwater resource plays a vital role in regional water supply because the quantity of groundwater pumpage has exceeded 1/3 of the total quantity of water supply. However, without proper management of groundwater usage, series environmental impacts such as land subsidence and seawater intrusions have occurred. To achieve the goal of sustainable management of groundwater resource, an accurate estimation of groundwater recharge is required.\nThis study proposes to integrate PCRaster with maps of land use and surface soil and rainfall records to determine the spatial and temporal variations of groundwater recharge. PCRaster is a kind of raster based GIS software and its scripting interface is easy to create a spatio-temporal recharge estimation model. In the first step, the map of land use is re-grouped into three categories, impermeable zones, permeable zones and water bodies. For impermeable zones, the recharge quantities are assumed as zeros. Two kinds of estimating equations, a rainfall-infiltration equation and a saturated recharge equation, are respectively used to calculate the recharges of permeable zones and water bodies. The map of surface soil is used to define the spatial distribution of soil parameters in two equations. The temporal records of rainfall define the temporal variable in the rainfall-infiltration equation.\nThe study area is Pingtung Plain which is 1,229 km2 in southern of Taiwan. In the process of estimation, the size of cells is 20 meters by 20 meters. The horizontal of estimation is during 1999 to 2010. The accumulated recharge is about 20.11 billion m3. (1.67 m3/yr). The annual recharge in 2008 is 1.89 billion m3. The annual recharges vary from 1.3 to 2.1 billion m3 because of different hydrological conditions. The infiltrated recharge in May and November in 2008 respectively are 430 (22.73%) and 67 (3.53%) million m3.",

            "abstract": "A dense GPS network throughout Japan as well as several seafloor stations have recorded significant horizontal and vertical postseismic displacements following the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. We use these observations to constrain finite element models of viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip that take into account the complex geometry of both the Pacific and Philippian Sea Plate subduction zones. Our results suggest that postseismic deformations can be explained primarily by viscoelastic relaxation of coseismic stresses associated with a very heterogeneous rheologic structure influenced by the regional thermal structure and the stress state. Significant afterslip, generally considered to be the primary postseismic mechanisms following subduction zone earthquakes, appears to be limited to two specific zones within the deeper slab interface, where the two most prominent aftershocks occurred. Observed postseismic subsidence in the volcanic arc region of northern Japan is best explain by a shallow low viscosity zone consistent with high heat flow. Significant westerly seafloor displacements can be accounted for by viscoelastic flow either within a narrow asthenospheric channel below the Pacific plate (as previously reported) or within the lower half of the bending portion of the slab, indicative of low-temperature plasticity (Peierls mechanism). Results also indicate significant postseismic flow within the cold nose of the mantle wedge (temperatures less than 700°C), suggesting the low temperature plasticity may be active throughout the highly stresses regions of subduction zones. A muted postseismic response in the southern reaches of the coseismically-stressed region is consistent with the influence of the presence of strong, but thin subducting Philippian Sea Plate.",

            "abstract": "Light elements have been suggested to be present in the liquid iron cores of the terrestrial planets and moons based on seismological and geochemical observations. It is therefore critical to determine precisely the phase diagrams for Fe-X (X=S, Si, C, O, H, etc.) alloying liquids in order to constrain the light element abundances in planetary cores, and to understand the dynamics and chemical evolution of the planets. Our goal is to refine the phase diagrams of Fe-S, Fe-Si and Fe-C at high pressures. We have successfully determined, at pressures up to 7 GPa, the temperatures of both solidus and liquidus of Fe alloys, with various S, Si and C contents, using ultrasonic wave velocity measurements in multi-anvil apparatus. During the heating of the experiment, we observe the solidus through the disappearance of the P-waves signal when the sample is partially molten, and the liquidus through the appearance of the signal from the liquid when the sample is entirely molten. Those observations have been confirmed during in-situ synchrotron experiments on Fe-5wt%C, Fe-10wt%C, Fe-5wt%Si and Fe-25wt%Si, using the ultrasonic measurements in conjunction with x-ray diffraction at the GSECARS Beamline 13-ID-D. In fact the ultrasonic interferometry allow to determine the solidus and liquidus temperatures more precisely than the x-ray diffraction. Traditional quench experiments used to determine phase relations require a large number of experiments. It is particularly challenging when the phase loop is narrow such as the case of the Fe-Si system. This new off-line in situ technique is a powerful tool to study partially or entirely molten samples without access to a synchrotron radiation source.",

            "abstract": "Although many developed countries have well-established systems for river monitoring and flood early warning systems, the population affected in developing countries by flood events is unsettled. Even more, future climate development is likely to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events and therefore bigger impacts on the population can be expected.\nThere are different types of flood forecasting systems, some are based on hydrologic models fed with rainfall predictions and observed river levels. Flood hazard maps are also used to increase preparedness in case of an extreme event, however these maps are static since they do not incorporate daily changing conditions on river stages. However, and especially in developing countries, data on river stages are scarce. Some of the reasons are that traditional fixed monitoring systems do not scale in terms of costs, repair is difficult as well as operation and maintenance, in addition vandalism poses additional challenges. Therefore there is a need of cheaper and easy-to-use systems for collecting information on river stage and discharge. We have developed a mobile device application for determining the water stage and discharge of open-channels (e.g. rivers, artificial channels, irrigation furrows). Via image processing the water level and surface velocity are measured, combining this information with priori knowledge on the channel geometry the discharge is estimated.\nRiver stage and discharge measurement via smart phones provides a non-intrusive, accurate and cost-effective monitoring method. No permanent installations, which can be flooded away, are needed. The only requirement is that the field of view contains two reference markers with known scale and with known position relative to the channel geometry, therefore operation and maintenance costs are very low. The other advantage of using smartphones, is that the data collected can be immediately sent via SMS to a central database. This information can be easily gathered for its use within models and redistributed, using the same channels, among interested stakeholders and the community.",

            "abstract": "In the period 2008-2015 Dutch marine and oceanographic research was organized in a single, large national program, under the name ‘Sea and Coastal Research’ (Dutch acronym: ZKO). This ZKO program consisted of some 57 different projects, covering all major oceanographic disciplines. The research areas ranged from the Dutch coast and the Wadden Sea to the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\nFrom the outset the ZKO program comprehensively  addressed data management. As such a data policy was written requiring open access to all data resulting from the program. All project PIs signed to agree with this data policy. In addition, a separate project was funded to establish the ZKO data facility and to preserve ZKO data for future re-use. The ZKO data facility is part of the data center of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ). The NIOZ data center in turn is actively involved in the cyberinfrastructures of the Netherlands National Oceanographic Data Committee (NL-NODC) and the pan-European SeaDataNet project. As a result, an unprecedented level of standardization was achieved, ensuring that the ZKO data are preserved and made available through global systems.\nThis presentation will provide a concise overview of the ZKO program in The Netherlands. The emphasis will be on how the data management of the program was organized and what lessons can be learned from the chosen approach. Finally, the links with national and international oceanographic cyberinfrastructures will be highlighted and it will be shown how data from ZKO funded projects is made available to a global audience.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause has a large density asymmetry across the current sheet. To study effects of the density asymmetry on the ion and electron dynamics, plasmas with a significant (~10) density asymmetry are created in the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) [1]. The density asymmetry affects the ion flow pattern by changing the in-plane electrostatic field such that the potential decrease on the high-density side becomes much smaller than that on the low-density side [2]. The ion inflow stagnation point is shifted toward the low-density side and the maximum ion outflow velocity is observed on the low-density side. The density asymmetry also makes the electron temperature profile asymmetric, which has a higher temperature near the low-density-side separatrices. The bulk electron heating is proportional to the total incoming magnetic energy per particle. The electron energization process during asymmetric reconnection is studied via numerical simulations. By comparing 2D simulations with corresponding 3D simulations, we find that the overall energization process does not depend on variations along the third dimension. Where and how electrons are energized during asymmetric reconnection will be discussed by using data from 2D numerical simulations. Finally, the scaling of the reconnection rate and the ion outflow speed given by the Cassak and Shay 2007 [3] is tested by systematically varying the density ratio. The measured ion outflow speed is about 40% of the theoretical values and the measured reconnection rate agrees with the scaling only with the measured density in the exhaust region.\n[1] M.

Formal data assimilation using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion reduces the optimization\nvariable space, while enabling candidate solutions to implicitly honor both hard (well) data and prior\ngeologic characterizations. Minimization of the mismatch in pressure response between synthetic\n`true' and history matched models is performed using particle swarm optimization. Our results\nindicate that, given the prior geologic characterization, as little as six to 12 months of pressure\nmonitoring data may be sufficient to reasonably locate a leak and to quantify leakage, including future\nleakage over extended periods. We find that the accuracy in predicting leak locations improves with\nadditional monitoring wells and suggest that three to four wells may be sufficient for reasonable\nlocation estimates. No significant benefit is seen in the cases considered when using multilevel versus\nsingle-level wells for monitoring in the overlying aquifer. Finally, we find that adding white noise, with\nmagnitude consistent with current pressure monitoring techniques, generally reduces error in\nsolutions, which is likely due to a regularization effect.

            "abstract": "Basaltic eruptions often are relatively quiescent, producing lava flows and small strombolian eruptions. On the other hand, andesitic eruptions often are much more violent, sometimes plinian. In both cases the eruptions are typically driven by the exsolution of volatiles, primarily H2O, CO2, S and halogens. We seek to understand the origin of these differences in the “average” eruption styles of basaltic and more-silicic magmas. We hypothesize that the topological properties of bubble foams created during vesiculation play an important role in controlling the explosivity of eruptions. As the bubble fraction increases during vesiculation a competition develops between the falling strength of the magma and its increasing permeability. If the permeability increases sufficiently to release trapped magmatic gases before the fragmentation threshold is reached the eruption will be quiescent, whereas if the permeability does not reach a critical threshold value the magma can fragment, producing a violent eruption. To test this hypothesis, we performed 4-D (x, y, z, and time) X-ray microtomography on the TOMCAT beamline at the Swiss Light Source during 1-atm. vesiculation of previously hydrated melts of basaltic, andesitic and dacitic compositions at temperatures reaching 1200 °C. We find that bubble inter-connectivity is significantly higher in basaltic melts than in andesitic and dacitic melts. This higher inter-connectivity in basaltic systems results in higher permeabilities than in andesitic magmas at similar porosities and reduces the probability of violent basaltic eruptions. We attribute the higher bubble inter-connectivity in basaltic melts to their low viscosities, which in some cases are orders-of-magnitude below those of more-silicic melts. We suggest that characterization of the inter-connectivity of a volcano's previous eruptive products (e.g., scoria, pumice, etc.) may provide insight into the explosivity of its future eruptions.",

Lessons learned by comparing the forecast accuracy determined during an event to modified applications of the models after-the-fact provide improved methods for real-time forecasting for future events. Variables such as source definition, data assimilation, and model scaling factors are examined to optimize forecast accuracy. Forecast accuracy is also compared for direct forward modeling based on earthquake source parameters versus accuracy obtained by assimilating sea level data into the forecast model.

            "abstract": "In Indonesia, peatlands are a major and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions due to increasing pressure from oil palm and pulp wood plantations. We are using a combination of field measures, laboratory experiments, and remote sensing to investigate relationships among land use, climatic factors and biogeochemical controls, and their influence on trace gas fluxes from tropical peat soils. Analysis of soils collected from peat sites on two major islands indicated substantial variation in peat substrate quality and nutrient content among land uses and geographic location. We conducted laboratory incubations to test the influence of substrate quality and nutrient availability on CO2 production from peat decomposition. Differences in peat characteristics attributable to land use change were tested by comparison of forest and oil palm peat samples collected from the same peat dome in Kalimantan. Regional differences in peat characteristics were tested by comparison of samples from Sumatra with samples from Kalimantan. We conducted additional experiments to test the influence of N and P availability and labile carbon on CO2 production. Under moisture conditions typical of oil palm plantations, CO2 production was higher from peat forest samples than from oil palm samples. CO2 production from Sumatra and Kalimantan oil palm samples was not different, despite apparent differences in nutrient content of these soils. N and P treatments representative of fertilizer application rates raised CO2 production from forest samples but not oil palm samples. Labile carbon treatments raised CO2 production in all samples. Our results suggest that decomposition of peat forest soils is nutrient limited, while substrate quality controls decomposition of oil palm soils post-conversion. Though fertilizer application could accelerate peat decomposition initially, fertilizer application may not influence long-term CO2 emissions from oil palm on peat.",

            "abstract": "The Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP) onboard the Suomi NPP satellite is design to measure ozone profiles with a high vertical resolution (~2 km) and dense spatial sampling (~1° latitude). The LP sensor represents a new generation of the US ozone profile instruments with the plan for a follow-up limb instrument onboard the Joint Polar Satellite System 2 (JPSS-2) in 2021. In this study we will examine the suitability of using LP profiles to continue the EOS climate ozone profile record from the SAGE and MLS datasets. First of all, we evaluate the accuracy in determining the LP tangent height by analyzing measured and calculated radiances. The accurate estimation of the tangent height is critical for limb observations. Several methods were explored to estimate the uncertainties in the LP tangent height registration, and the results will be briefly summarized in this presentation. Version 2 of LP data, released in May 2014, includes a static adjustment of ~1.5 km and a dynamic tangent height adjustment within each orbit. A recent analysis of Version 2 Level 1 radiances revealed a 100 m step in the tangent height that occurred on 26 April 2013, due to a switch to two star trackers in determining spacecraft position. In addition, a ~200 m shift in the tangent height along each orbit was detected. These uncertainties in tangent height registrations can affect the stability of the LP ozone record. Therefore, the second step in our study includes a validation of LP ozone profiles against correlative satellite ozone measurements (Aura MLS, ACE-FTS, OSIRIS, and SBUV) with the focus on time-dependent changes. We estimate relative drifts between OMPS LP and correlative ozone records to evaluate stability of the LP measurements. We also test the tangent height corrections found in the internal analysis of Version 2 measurements to determine their effect on the long-term stability of the LP ozone record.",

            "abstract": "There are numerous studies that show well-resolved Fe isotope fractionations in igneous materials from different planetary bodies. Potential explanations for these fractionations include a non-chondritic bulk planetary Fe isotopic composition, and equilibrium fractionation between Fe-alloys or minerals and silicate melts during planetary differentiation, mantle melting, or fractional crystallization. This is further complicated by the fact that these processes are not mutually exclusive, making the interpretation of Fe isotope data a complex task. Here we present new experimental results investigating the effect of C on Fe isotope fractionation between molten peridotite and an Fe-alloy.\nExperiments were conducted at 1 GPa and 1850° C for 0.5 – 3 hours on a mixture of an 54Fe-spiked peridotite and Fe-metal with and without Ni metal in an end-loaded piston cylinder at the Geophysical Laboratory. Carbon saturation was achieved with a graphite capsule, and resulted in C contents of the Fe-alloy in our experiments ranging from 3.8 – 4.9 wt. %. The metal and silicate phases from half of each experiment were separated manually and dissolved in concentrated acids. Iron was separated from matrix elements by anion exchange chromatagraphy. Iron-isotopic compositions were determined with the Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS at GL. The other half of each experiment was used for quantitative microbeam analysis. Equilibrium was assessed with a time series and the three-isotope exchange method.\nThe Ni-free experiments resulted in no resolvable Fe isotope fractionation between the Fe-C-alloy and molten silicate. This is in contrast to the results of Shahar et al. (2015) which showed a fractionation for Δ57Fe of ~0.18 ‰ between a peridotite and an Fe-alloy with a similar S abundance to C in these experiments. The one experiment thus far that contained Ni (~4 wt. % in the alloy) showed a resolvable fractionation between the Fe-Ni-C alloy and silicate of ~0.10 ‰. Shahar et al. found a similar magnitude fractionation to our Ni bearing experiment in experiments with no C or S. The difference in temperature (1650° C in Shahar et al. vs. 1850° C here) may be partially responsible for these discrepancies. Ongoing experiments will further investigate the effects of C and other light elements on Fe isotope fractionation during core segregation.",

These projects focus on multi-decadal reanalyses of the global climate system. To ensure data quality and provide end users with information about uncertainties in these products, the 4th work package of ERA_CLIM2 deals with the quality assessment of the products including quality control and error estimation.\nIn doing so, the monthly totals of the ERA-20C reanalysis are compared to two corresponding Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) products; the Full Data Reanalysis Version 7 and the new HOMogenized PRecipitation Analysis of European in-situ data (HOMPRA Europe).\nERA-20C reanalysis was produced based on ECMWFs IFS version Cy38r1 with a spatial resolution of about 125 km. It covers the time period 1900 to 2010. Only surface observations are assimilated namely marine winds and pressure. This allows the comparison with independent, not assimilated data.\nThe GPCC Full Data Reanalysis Version 7 comprises monthly land-surface precipitation from approximately 75,000 rain-gauges covering the time period 1901-2013. For this paper, the version with 1° resolution is utilized.\nFor trend analysis, a monthly European subset of the ERA-20C reanalysis is investigated spanning the years 1951-2005. The European subset will be compared to a new homogenized GPCC data set HOMPRA Europe. The latter is based on a collective of 5373 homogenized monthly rain gauge time series, carefully chosen from the GPCC archive of precipitation data.\nFor the spatial and temporal evaluation of ERA-20C, global scores on monthly, seasonal and annual time scales are calculated. These include contingency table scores, correlation, along with spatial scores such as the fractional skill score. Unsurprisingly regions with strongest deviations are those of data scarcity, mountainous regions with their luv and lee effects, and monsoon regions. They all exhibit strong biases throughout their series, and severe shifts in the means.\nThe new HOMPRA Europe data set is useful in particular for trend analysis. Therefore it is compared to a monthly European subset of the ERA-20C reanalysis for the same period, i.e. the years 1951-2005, to study the ERA-20C capability in reproducing observed trends across Europe.",

It is known that Kelvin waves induce large temperature variations in the TTL. We investigated the temperature variations in the TTL using both numerical data produced by the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) and various observational data including satellite data (the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate; COSMIC), the reanalysis data of different resolution (ERA-40-interim, NCEP-CFSR, MERRA, YOTC-ECMWF), and radiosonde data for the Cooperative Indian Ocean experiment on intra-seasonal variability in the Year 2011 (CINDY).\nWe found that all the data shows that the temperature variations become larger over the mountainous regions of the Indonesian maritime continent than over the oceanic regions and that the large temperature variations are associated with Kelvin waves. As, the horizontal resolution of the reanalysis becomes higher, the standard deviations of the TTL temperature near the mountains became larger. When Kelvin waves passed over the Indonesian maritime continent, the amplitude of temperature becomes about 2 K larger over the mountainous regions. The power spectrum for the periods between 7 days and 12 days was larger over the mountainous regions compared with that over the ocean. The sensitivity study using the stretch-NICAM shows that the height of mountains clearly affect the amplitude of temperature near the TTL.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we use the Community Earth System Model to investigate the effects of employing cool roofs (i.e. increasing roof albedo from 0.15 to 0.9) on urban, regional, and global climates. After increasing the roof albedo, urban heat islands are reduced significantly over the globe during summer, and those at low latitudes during winter; the annual- and global-mean urban minus rural air temperature decreases from 1.6 K to 1.2 K. We mainly focus on changes in energy fluxes and climates in four regions: the United States, China, India, and Europe. For each region, solar radiation reflected by surface increases proportionally to the estimated albedo increase induced by roof albedo change. Without considering clouds, the increase in reflected solar radiation at surface leads to proportional increase in outgoing shortwave radiation at top of the atmosphere, suggesting a radiative cooling effect of cool roofs. On the other hand, the variations of cloud forcing in the model are more significant than the influence of cool roofs on energy balance at top of the atmosphere in some areas. Aerosols are known to partially offset the effects of cool roofs by absorbing solar radiation, and also reflecting radiation back to surface. However, we find that additional aerosol forcing is only 5-10% of the increase in reflected solar radiation at surface. Previous studies disagree in cool roof’s influence on global climate. We find that its influence on global mean temperature is negligible; the temperature decreases by 0.0015 K, with a high uncertainty of 0.026 K.",

We performed a validation of the data from GOSAT and GEOS–Chem with total column observations (TCCON). Satellite data and model simulation results show very similar seasonal variation and spatial distribution with well-known difference with TCCON data. The analysis of the long-range transport and high concentration (HC) events using surface/satellite observations and modeling results was conducted. During the HC events, the concentrations of CO2 and other air pollutants such as SO2 and CO are higher than that of all episodes. It means that CO2 known as a globally well-mixed gas may also play as a finger-print of human activity with unique regional characteristics like other air pollutants. The comprehensive analysis, in particular with GOSAT CO2 observation data, shows that CO2 plume with high concentration can be long-range transported with 1-2 days duration with regional scale. This analysis with satellite data and modeling conducted in this study can help better understanding of the behavior of CO2 and its impact on climate change and the carbon cycle.",

The ILRS analysts adopted a revision of the internal standards and procedures in developing our contribution to ITRF2014 from our eight Analysis Centers. Anticipating the release of ITRF2014 we worked on designing and executing tests using data and products unique to ILRS. In addition to the data contributed to ITRF2014, ILRS has several other targets, in lower and higher orbits, the SLR tracking data of which are used as independent data for the evaluation process. Since SLR data are primarily sensitive to the origin and scale definition of the TRF model, these model attributes are the best to be validated using SLR data. LAGEOS and ETALON data collected outside the span of data used in ITRF2014 can also evaluate the quality of the estimated velocity vectors. The use of independent SLR data evaluates the model throughout the period that such data are available. SLR data from low altitude missions can validate the performance of the model from the late ‘70s all the way to present (using e.g. STARLETTE and LARES data).

In order to provide a better assessment of the VIIRS LSA data, this study performed comprehensive validation and evaluation in four aspects: 1) Comparing VIIRS LSA with global field measurements including Surfard, BSRN, GC-net, etc. Result shows VIIRS albedo has an overall bias of 0.004 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.024 against those ground sites. 2) Inter-comparing VIIRS LSA with albedo derived from other data source to see the discrepancies of albedo estimation among different sensors. Result shows that VIIRS LSA has a high agreement with high resolution albedo maps derived from Landsat data (bias = 0.003, RMSE = 0.019), and the 16-day mean VIIRS albedo agrees well with MODIS blue-sky albedo (bias = 0.001 and RMSE = 0.019). 3) Establishing a long-term monitoring tool for VIIRS LSA to regularly detect the global albedo change and related disturbances.

Although previous studies suggested the dependences of air-sea fluxes on surface waves and sea spray, how these processes modify air-sea fluxes under TC conditions has never been investigated based on in-situ observations. Using continuous meteorological and surface wave data from a moored buoy in the northern South China Sea, this study examined the effects of surface waves and sea spray on air-sea fluxes during the passage of typhoon Hagupit. The mooring is located within about 40 kilometers of the center of typhoon Hagupit. It is found that surface waves could increase momentum flux to the ocean by about 15%, and that sea spray could enhance both sensible and latent heat fluxes to the atmosphere, making Hagupit gain 500 W/m2 more heat flux from the ocean. These results have significant implication for understanding TC-ocean interaction and improving TC intensity forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Light competition is a fundamental organizing principle of forest ecosystems, and interactions between forest structure and light availability provide an important constraint on forest productivity. Tropical forests maintain a dense, multi-layered canopy, based in part on abundant diffuse light reaching the forest understory. Climate-driven changes in light availability, such as more direct illumination during drought conditions, therefore alter the potential productivity of forest ecosystems during such events. Here, we used multi-temporal airborne lidar data over a range of Amazon forest conditions to explore the influence of forest structure on gross primary productivity (GPP). Our analysis combined lidar-based observations of canopy illumination and turnover in the Ecosystem Demography model (ED, version 2.2). The ED model was updated to specifically account for regional differences in canopy and understory illumination using lidar-derived measures of canopy light environments. Model simulations considered the influence of forest structure on GPP over seasonal to decadal time scales, including feedbacks from differential productivity between illuminated and shaded canopy trees on mortality rates and forest composition. Finally, we constructed simple scenarios with varying diffuse and direct illumination to evaluate the potential for novel plant-climate interactions under scenarios of climate change. Collectively, the lidar observations and model simulations underscore the need to account for spatial heterogeneity in the vertical structure of tropical forests to constrain estimates of tropical forest productivity under current and future climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Contourites are sediments deposited or substantially reworked by thermohaline-induced deepwater bottom currents. The study of contourites with growing interests is widely conducted in seismic stratigraphy, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, and hydrocarbon exploration. However, the sedimentary dynamic process producing contourites in the deepwater environment is still poorly understood. This research presents an interdisciplinary approach from long-term in situ mooring and tripod observations, multi-beam seabed morphology, seismic stratigraphy, to IMAGES (Marion Dufresne) piston coring and ODP (JOIDES Resolution) drilling studies on the formation of a contourite drift on the lower slope of the northern South China Sea. The contourite drift with ~520 m thick is distributed in water depths ranging from 1650 m to 2500 m and has been accumulated since 1.5 Ma in early Pleistocene. The nowadays contour currents in the northern South China Sea were observed with velocities generally ranging in 0-2 cm/s with a dominant flow direction of ~250º (southwestward/along-slope). However, the relatively stable contour currents were disturbed by several bursts of increased velocities up to 8-11 cm/s, each lasting 2-3 weeks and followed by a direction reversal, which were caused by passing-through of deep-reaching mesoscale eddies. The along-slope sediment transport is induced by both mesoscale eddy and contour currents, and these suspended sediments are mainly derived from Taiwan according to provenance analysis of sediments traps equipped on moorings. Seismic stratigraphy and core sample analysis (oxygen isotope stratigraphy, clay mineralogy, and grain size) reveal a long sedimentary history with strong influence of deepwater currents that have carried the majority of Taiwan-sourced sediments moving westward since early Pleistocene. The glacial-cyclic terrigenous input from various surrounding drainage systems and their transport processes from fluvial source to deep-sea sink are semi-quantitatively reconstructed. The results highlight the significance of contour currents on the long-term evolution of the contourite drift and the sea-level-change controlled glacial-cyclic sedimentary dynamic processes since early Pleistocene in the northern South China Sea.",

The main objective of the “Brazilian Study and Monitoring of Space Weather (Embrace) Program” is to proceed with data collection and maintenance of Space Weather observation, modeling processes of the Sun-Earth on a global and regional scale, provide information in real time and make Space Weather forecast, and provide diagnostics of their effects on different technology systems through the collection of satellite data, surface and computational modeling. Advantage was taken on the long lasting expertise of the local scientific community, specially regarding local phenomena, such as the equatorial ionosphere and effects of the South American Magnetic Anomaly. Since April 2012, weekly briefings are held where scientists discuss and evaluate in a comprehensive manner all the chains of events from the sun, interplanetary space, earth magnetosphere, radiation belts, ionosphere, upper atmosphere, and reaching the effects on ground. One unique aspect of Embrace program is the strong emphasis on ionospheric and upper atmospheric disturbances. Recently, strong focus on radiation belt variability is progressively been included. Another important particularity of this program is the use of cosmic ray observations to develop nowcasting and forecasting of solar wind structures. In this work, we present an overview of activities and contributions related to the EMBRACE Program.",

            "abstract": "Postseismic deformation indicates a viscoelastic response of the lithosphere. It is critical, then, to identify and estimate the extent of postseismic deformation in both space and time, not only for its inherent information on crustal rheology and earthquake physics, but also since it must considered for plate motion models that are derived geodetically from the “steady-state” interseismic velocities, models of the earthquake cycle that provide interseismic strain accumulation and earthquake probability forecasts, as well as terrestrial reference frame definition that is the basis for space geodetic positioning. As part of the Solid Earth Science ESDR System) SESES project under a NASA MEaSUREs grant, JPL and SIO estimate combined daily position time series for over 1800 GNSS stations, both globally and at plate boundaries, independently using the GIPSY and GAMIT software packages, but with a consistent set of a prior epoch-date coordinates and metadata. The longest time series began in 1992, and many of them contain postseismic signals. For example, about 90 of the global GNSS stations out of more than 400 that define the ITRF have experienced one or more major earthquakes and 36 have had multiple earthquakes; as expected, most plate boundary stations have as well. We quantify the spatial (distance from rupture) and temporal (decay time) extent of postseismic deformation. We examine parametric models (log, exponential) and a physical model (rate- and state-dependent friction) to fit the time series. Using a PCA analysis, we determine whether or not a particular earthquake can be uniformly fit by a single underlying postseismic process – otherwise we fit individual stations. Then we investigate whether the estimated time series velocities can be directly used as input to plate motion models, rather than arbitrarily removing the apparent postseismic portion of a time series and/or eliminating stations closest to earthquake epicenters.",

Measurements of the parallel electric fields responsible for electron acceleration, and wave activity associated with reconnection onset and electron scattering require precise knowledge of the magnetic field amplitude and phase. The fluxgate and searchcoil magnetometers on MMS are sensitive to low- and high-frequency field fluctuations, respectively. In the middle frequency range, we optimize sensitivity by merging the two datasets to create a single magnetic field data product. We analyze frequency-dependent amplitude and phase relationships between the two instruments to determine how they should be joined. The result is a product with the time resolution and Nyquist frequency of the searchcoil, but with the fluxgate's ability to measure the DC magnetic field. This dataset provides improved phase information suitable for determining parallel electric fields during magnetic reconnection events. Its enhanced sensitivity also makes it ideal for resolving thin current layers and uncovering low-amplitude wave activity, such as EMIC waves related to substorm injections and Alfven or lower hybrid waves related to reconnection.",

Shells of different size were collected between 2011 and 2013. δ18Oshell values of all samples show a sinusoidal pattern, which correlate with annual hydrographical cycles, as well as with δ18Owater values, reflecting different sources of water during dry and wet season. Seasonal minima and maxima in δ18Oshell values agreed well with δ18Owater values, which ranged between -3.7 ‰ and +2.6 ‰, while discharge ranged between 293 and 8868 m3 s-1 during the reference time interval (between August 2009 and December 2013). The relationship between discharge and δ18Owater values fits a logarithmic regression (R2=0.76), which we used to calculate discharge after reconstructing δ18Owater values from δ18Oshell data. Because of the logarithmic relationship between discharge and δ18Owater values, δ18Owater values are not sensitive to the average to high discharge range, but δ18Owater values shift significantly towards higher values during low flow conditions, which allows the reconstruction of dry period discharge. Comparing observed discharge data with calculated values indeed show that shell data can mainly be used as records of low discharge situations, and suggest that shell growth may regularly cease during high discharge (above 4000-5000 m3 s-1). Overall, our data indicate that freshwater bivalve shell isotope data hold high potential to reconstruct long-term patterns in riverine hydrological conditions.",

            "abstract": "Tide gauges and satellite-based radar altimeter measurements provide evidence that the global mean sea level (GMSL) has been rising during the last two centuries and that this rate has been accelerating since the early 1900's, reaching 2.0±0.3 mm/year over 1971-2010 and 3.2±0.4 mm/year over 1993-2012 (Church et al. 2013). Ocean thermal expansion was identified as one of the main contributors, accounting for about 40% of the GMSL rise over 1971-2010 and 30% over 1993-2012 (Church et al. 2013).\nThe influence of external forcings and of climate internal variability (CIV) on the climate system and more specifically on the global mean thermosteric sea level (GMTSL) remains unclear while its understanding is essential to project sea level rise. Idealized simulations of the climate system, with none or a chosen combination of forcings, provide some information on the pattern and amplitude of the GMTSL response. However, climate models significantly underestimate the CIV and therefore its effects.\nThis study aims at assessing each forcing and CIV contributions to GMTSL changes, using a new detection and attribution method based on additive decomposition. Developed by Ribes et al. (2015), this approach dismisses the usual linear regression and proposes a symmetric treatment of the magnitude and pattern of the climate response to each forcing. Besides, more realistic estimates of the CIV than those provided by climate models are tested to gain more confidence in the results. We use CMIP5 large ensemble of forced and unforced simulations to estimate the GMTSL response to natural, anthropogenic, greenhouse gas and other forcings. Observational datasets are then used to constrain this first estimate to a more accurate result. Uncertainties may be further reduced by applying this method to a bivariate case. In this latter approach, we investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of thermosteric sea level changes and will present some results at a regional scale.",

            "abstract": "We use multi-spacecraft observations by MMS and Cluster in the magnetotail and 3D PIC simulations to investigate conversion of electromagnetic energy at the front of a plasma jet. In PIC simulations the plasma jets (fast localized plasma flows) are produced by magnetic reconnection, while in observations we study bursty bulk flows (BBFs). Jet fronts are known to have a sharp increase of magnetic field (referred to as dipolarization fronts in the magnetospheric physics) as well as sharp gradients in plasma density and temperature. These sharp gradients at the front generate broadband turbulence in the lower-hybrid frequency range, which have amplitudes several times larger than the convective field, wave potential comparable to electron thermal energy, and perpendicular wavelength of the order of several electron gyro-scales. Despite the large wave amplitudes, we find only moderate dissipation due to these waves in the front reference frame, which goes into heating of electrons. We find that the major dissipation is happening in the Earth (laboratory) frame and it is related to reflection and acceleration of ions from the jet front. This dissipation operates at scales of the order several ion inertial lengths, and the primary contribution to E*J is coming from the convective electric field of the front (E=Vfront_x B) and the current flowing at the front.",

            "abstract": "Different vegetation indices derived from satellites were often used as a proxy of vegetation activity to monitor and evaluate the impacts of drought and heat wave on ecosystem carbon fluxes (gross primary production, respiration) through the production efficiency models (PEMs). However, photosynthesis is also regulated by a series of physiological processes which cannot be directly observed through satellites. In this study, we analyzed the response of drought and heat wave induced GPP and climate anomaly from 15 Euroflux sites and the corresponding vegetation indices from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite. Correlation analysis suggests that the vegetation indices are more responsive to GPP variation in grasslands and open shrublands, but less responsive in forest ecosystems. Physiology control can be up to 20% of the total GPP during the drought period without changing the canopy structure. At temporal scale for each site, VPD and vegetation indices can be used to track the GPP for forest and non-forest, respectively. However, different stand characteristics should be taken into consideration for forest ecosystems. Based on the above findings, a conceptual model is built to illuminate the physiological and canopy control on the GPP during the drought period. Improvement for future PEMs should incorporate better indicators to deal with drought conditions for different ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) in a warming climate is of critical interest to scientists and the general public in the context of future sea-level rise. The mass balance of the GIS has been increasingly negative over recent decades, with a conservative estimate of ice sheet mass loss of 2000 Gt yr-1 over the 1988-2014 period. Snow accumulation, the critical input to surface mass balance, varies through time and regionally around Greenland and from the coast to interior, but is constrained by relatively few observations. An improved understanding of temporal and spatial snow accumulation variability will thus reduce uncertainties in GIS mass balance models and sea-level rise projections. Here we quantify spatial and temporal variations in snow accumulation in central and southwest Greenland using data from NASA’s Operation IceBridge Accumulation Radar. We estimate depth-density and depth-age relationships using a Herron-Langway density model and Nye flow model, which are iteratively calculated at 50 km intervals along each radar line. We then trace isochrones to calculate spatial and temporal variability in average snow accumulation along several flight paths throughout central and southwestern Greenland. Depth-density, depth-age, and snow accumulation calculations are calibrated at Summit using data from the GISP2, Katie, and SM07C ice cores. Accumulation results will be verified by a series of snow pits, shallow firn cores, and ice-penetrating radar profiles collected on the Greenland Traverse for Accumulation and Climate Studies (GreenTrACS) through southwest Greenland during spring 2016 and 2017.",

            "abstract": "This study presents a detailed analysis of the ground motion in Central Mexico based on numerical simulations, as well as broadband and strong ground motion records. We describe and evaluate a velocity model for Central Mexico derived from noise and regional earthquake cross-correlations, which is used throughout this research to estimate the ground motion in the region. The 3D crustal model includes a geotechnical structure of the Valley of Mexico (VM), subduction zone geometry, and 3D velocity distributions. The latter are based on more than 200 low magnitude (Mw < 4.5) earthquakes and two years of noise recordings. We emphasize the analysis on the ground motion in the Valley of Mexico originating from intra-slab deep events and temblors located along the Pacific coast. Also, we quantify the effects Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and the low-velocity deposits on the ground motion. The 3D octree-based finite element wave propagation computations, valid up to 1 Hz, reveal that the inclusion of a basin with a structure as complex as the Valley of Mexico dramatically enhances the regional effects induced by the TMVB. Moreover, the basin not only produces ground motion amplification and anomalous duration, but it also favors the energy focusing into zones of Mexico City where structures typically undergo high levels of damage.",

            "abstract": "Coastal and equatorial upwelling in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) are responsible for about 10% of the ocean’s total production. The deep, cold, nutrient-rich waters supplied by upwelling originate in high latitudes, linking changes at high latitudes to the tropics. The Pliocene/Pleistocene transition which started around 2.7-3 million years ago (Ma) marked a period of higher variability in biological production and sea surface temperatures dominated by glacial/interglacial cycles. In addition, secular changes in the development of both Walker and Hadley cells appear to have impacted the strength of equatorial upwelling. However, the large positive production excursions, such as those found from 1.6 to 2.2 Ma, remain only moderately well characterized and both changes in high latitude nutrient supply and regional upwelling strength are implicated. ODP Site 846 is located in the heart of the EEP upwelling cold tongue and has ideal characteristics for examining these links and excursions. We present high-resolution (~0.5 ky) X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) chemical profiles of Ca, Si, Ba, Mn, Fe, Al, and Ti, as well as a total nitrogen (TN%) record for the last 5 million years from ODP Site 846. We use these high resolution profiles in conjunction with other regional data to assess biogeochemical processes in the EEP over the last 5 million years. CaCO3 and SiO2 are the two dominant biogenic components and account for more than 95% of the sediment. BaSO4 and the discrete TN% measurements record total productivity. MnO and Fe2O3 are redox-sensitive species and are particularly suited to tracing dissolution related to excess bottom-water metabolic processes driven by high export production at the high-alkalinity Site 846. Al2O3 and TiO2 are tracers of terrigenous input. A transition between low amplitude and high amplitude carbonate cycles occurs at 2.8 Ma, coinciding with the Pliocene/Pleistocene transition to higher amplitude glacial cycles. Notable excursions from the baseline high carbonate system occur between 3.8 and 4.2 Ma, between 1.6 and 2.2 Ma, at 0.75 Ma, and within the last 0.1 Ma. These excursions are explored, and causes include heavy contributions from productivity-driven dissolution, some extended instances of CCD-driven dissolution and shifts in overlying productivity towards diatoms.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes are capable of triggering seismic, aseismic and hydrological responses at long-range distances. In particular, recent studies have shown that microearthquakes are mostly triggered in volcanic/geothermal regions. However, it is still not clear how widespread the phenomenon is, and whether there are any causal links between large earthquakes and subsequent volcanic unrest/eruptions. In this study we conduct a systematic search for remotely triggered activity at the Piton de la Fournaise (PdlF) and Changbaishan (CBS) volcanoes. The PdlF is a shield volcano located on the east-southern part of the Reunion Island in Indian Ocean. It is one of the most active volcanoes around the world. The CBS volcano is an intraplate stratovolcano on the border between China and North Korea, and it was active with a major eruption around 1100 years ago and has been since dormant from AD 1903, however, it showed signals of unrest recently. We choose these regions because they are well instrumented and spatially close to recent large earthquakes, such as the 2004/12/26 Mw9.1 Sumatra, 2011/03/11 Mw9.0 Tohoku, and the 2012/04/11 Mw8.6 Indian Ocean Earthquakes. By examining continuous waveforms a few hours before and after many earthquakes since 2000, we find many cases of remote triggering around the CBS volcano. In comparison, we only identify a few cases of remotely triggered seismicity around the PdlF volcano, including the 2004 Sumatra earthquake. Notably, the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquake and its M8.2 aftershock did not trigger any clear increase of seismicity, at least during their surface waves. Our next step is to apply a waveform matching method to automatically detect volcano-seismicity in both regions, and then use them to better understand potential interactions between large earthquakes and volcanic activities.",

This makes the life of people highly vulnerable to availability of the water resources as soil moisture is one of the major fundamental variables in global hydrological cycles. The day-to-day variability in soil moisture on field to global scales is an important quantity for early warning systems for events like flooding and drought. In addition to the extreme situations the accurate soil moisture retrieval are important for agricultural irrigation scheduling and water resource management. The present study proposes a method to determine the effective soil hydraulic parameters directly from information available for the soil moisture state from the recently launched SMAP (L-band) microwave remote sensing observations. Since the optimized parameters are based on the near surface soil moisture information, further constraints are applied during the numerical simulation through the assimilation of GRACE Total Water Storage (TWS) within the physically based land surface model. This work addresses the improvement of available water capacity as the soil hydraulic parameters are optimized through the utilization of satellite-retrieved near surface soil moisture. The initial ranges of soil hydraulic parameters are taken in correspondence with the values available from the literature based on FAO. The optimization process is divided into two steps: the state variable are optimized and the optimal parameter values are then transferred for retrieving soil moisture and streamflow. A homogeneous soil system is considered as the soil moisture from sensors such as AMSR-E/SMAP can only be retrieved for the top few centimeters of soil. To evaluate the performance of the system in helping improve simulation accuracy and whether they can be used to obtain soil moisture profiles at poorly gauged catchments the root mean square error (RMSE) and Mean Bias error (MBE) are used to measure the performance of the simulations.",

We sampled the Heihe river water along the middle section during base flow and high discharge (irrigation periods), as well as groundwater scattered in the middle HRB. δ13C-DIC, nitrate, and cation were measured to constrain water and carbon sources. Considering positive correlations of δ13C-DIC with Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations and the distribution of maize in the midstream areas, the weathering of silicates with CO2 from C4 plants was the main source of DIC in the Heihe river. During base flow and high discharge, river water δ13C-DIC had similar values (-2.26‰ for average) at the mountain exit and sharply fell to averages of -4.36‰ at the baseflow and -5.80‰ at high discharge, as the river enters the midstream plain where larger fluxes of groundwater discharging to the river water were observed. δ13C-DIC values during high discharge than during baseflow conditions can be attributed to lower inputs of groundwater and stronger soil respiration in the growing season. A negative correlation between δ13C-DIC and nitrate at high discharge indicated stronger influences of soil respiration on river water DIC through irrigation return flows. The binary mixing model using groundwater and mountain exit as end-members was used to evaluate longitudinal variation in the fraction of groundwater contributing to river water. The proportion of groundwater increased from the boundary of the diluvial fan (about 20% at high discharge and 45% at base flow) to the exit edge of the middle basin (about 45% at high discharge and 60% at base flow).",

Bottom-up inventories indicate California’s fossil fuel CO2 emissions are currently about 100 Mt C per year, but different inventories show discrepancies of ±15% in the state-wide total, and some larger discrepancies in various sub-regions of the state. We are developing a top-down framework for investigating fossil fuel and biospheric CO2 fluxes in California using atmospheric observations and models. California has a relatively dense collaborative network of greenhouse gas observations run by several universities, government laboratories and Earth Networks. Using this collaborative network, we conducted three field campaigns in 2014-15 to sample flasks at 10 tower sites across the state. Flasks were analysed for atmospheric CO2 and CO concentrations and for stable isotopes and radiocarbon in CO2. The flask observations of radiocarbon in CO2 allow patterns of fossil fuel-derived and biospheric CO2 to be distinguished at relatively high resolution across the state. We will report initial results from the observations showing regional gradients in fossil fuel-derived CO2 and fluctuations from changing weather patterns. We will compare the observations of fossil fuel-derived CO2 to predictions from several bottom-up inventories and two atmospheric models. Linking the flask data with observations from OCO-2, TCCON, aircraft flights and ground-based in situ analyzers, we will examine the variation in total CO2 and its drivers over California. Further analysis is planned to integrate the data into an inversion framework for fossil fuel and biospheric CO2 fluxes over California.",

            "abstract": "Tristan da Cunha is a volcanic island in the South Atlantic located very close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Generally, it is accepted to be the location of a mantle plume, which has been active at least since the breakup of Gondwana at 130 Ma, the time when the Paraná/Etendeka flood basalts were emplaced. Furthermore, it is associated with the formation of the Walvis Ridge and the Rio Grande Rise, and therefore it’s one of the key examples of a hot spot track linking a flood basalt province to an active ocean island volcano. However, global tomography models are contradicting about the origin of Tristan da Cunha: Whether it is a deep mantle plume or caused by shallow plate tectonics. To gain a better understanding, we deployed 24 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers, 26 ocean-bottom electromagnetic stations and 2 seismological land stations in January 2012 with the German research vessel Maria S. Merian. We acquired continuous seismological data for one year and recovered the instruments in January 2013.\nWe use cross-correlated travel time residuals of teleseismic earthquakes to perform a finite-frequency tomography to resolve the P wave velocity upper mantle structure beneath the island. Here we show our preliminary results of the 3-D velocity perturbations in the upper mantle: We do not image a plume-like structure directly beneath the island. Instead we observe a low velocity region in the southwest of our array that might be related to a local mantle upwelling (mantle plume).\nAdditionally we show the local seismicity in the Tristan da Cunha region.\nChen et al. and Baba et al. will present the first results on the magnetotelluric experiment and Ryberg et al. will present the crustal structure around the Tristan da Cunha hotspot.",

            "abstract": "We present 3-D P- and S-wave velocity (Vp and Vs) models and new hypocenter locations for the Charlevoix seismic zone (CSZ) based upon local travel time tomography. Prominent velocity anomalies and the distribution of earthquakes are discussed in relation to known structural features produced by Iapetan rifting and a large Devonian meteor impact. The CSZ is located along the St. Lawrence River about 100 km downstream from Quebec City, Canada. A 7 station permanent network, augmented by temporary stations, records more than 200 earthquakes annually. The inversion dataset consists of 1,329 earthquakes providing 8,540 P-wave and 8,304 S-wave arrival times. Velocity model resolution is adequate to a depth of at least16 km as indicated by recovery of synthetic checkerboard models. Low Vp and Vs are associated with the impact structure to a depth of 12 km. A prominent high Vp feature is present north of the impact structure and high Vp and Vs extend below the impact at depths exceeding 12 km. Following inversion, hypocenter location errors are less than 0.2 km horizontally and 0.4 km vertically. Hypocenters form a semicircle delineating the eastern margin of the impact structure. Northeast of the impact, hypocenters cluster into planes in several locations, suggesting the presence of distinct, seismogenic faults. The planes trend NE, in the same direction as the Iapitan rift faults, and dip to the SE. One steeply dipping plane is located below the north shore of the St. Lawrence River and extends to a depth of at least 30 km. Two other planes with shallower dips are located below the river and extend to depths of 12 and 15 km. All three planes are disrupted when they encounter the impact but the north shore plane appears to continue through and below the impact zone. The presence of through-going Iapetan faults within the impact structure is an important constraint for 3-D stress models developed to explain the spatial distribution of seismicity in the CSZ. We identify individual fault segments and their relationship to the impact structure using a pattern recognition method called optimal anisotropic dynamic clustering that reconstructs the 3D structure of a fault network using the spatial locations of earthquakes.",

A month-long field sampling campaign will be conducted in Barrow, AK, at the confluence of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, from August to September 2015. Total suspended particulate (TSP) aerosol samples will be collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) climate research facility in Barrow, AK, USA. Samples will be analyzed for organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) on a Sunset carbon analyzer utilizing the NIOSH 5040 method. Samples will also be analyzed for water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) using a water extraction method and subsequent analysis on a Shimadzu Total Carbon Analyzer. Optical properties of the aqueous extracts will also be measured using an Agilent ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer. OC, EC and WSOC concentrations will then be compared to aerosol samples collected at the same location in summer 2012, prior to the onset of exploratory drilling in the Chukchi Sea. Back trajectory (BT) analysis will be performed for each sampling campaign to help assess the impact of source region on the carbonaceous aerosol budget and to identify any changes in source region between the two campaigns. A comparison of samples from the same location and season both prior to and post drilling will allow for a more accurate characterization and tracking of the potential impacts of new aerosol emission sources in the region.",

            "abstract": "Our current proxies for pCO2 suggest Neogene levels were relatively constant (~300 ± 100 ppm) except for the middle Miocene Climatic Optimum with estimates approaching 400 ± 100 ppm. Yet, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet became a polar ice sheet and permanent feature on Earth while large-scale Northern Hemisphere ice sheets waxed and waned with scant differences in pCO2. Three possibilities to explain these observations are: 1) our pCO2 proxies are incorrect; 2) Earth’s climate is far more sensitive than our current model simulations suggest; or 3) tectonic differences overprinted accepted climate sensitivity to pCO2.\nTwo marine gateways that influenced Neogene deep-water circulation are the Greenland-Scotland Ridge and the Central American Isthmus (CAI). Driven by mantle plume variations under Iceland, the GSR acted as a regulator of Northern Component Water (NCW, analogous to NADW) by controlling access to the dense polar waters to the north. During the latest Miocene and early Pliocene, mean depths along the GSR and NCW production were at their greatest. By the late Pliocene (~3 Ma), mantle plume activity increased and NCW production waned.\nMost researchers have focused on surface water changes (e.g., salinity) in relating closure of the CAI to Pliocene climate change. However, I propose that its primary influence came with the elimination of low-latitude, deep-water connection between the Atlantic and Pacific. Combined with vigorous NCW production, closure of the CAI re-distributed nutrients between the oceans. Carbon isotope and Cd/Ca profiles indicate that “modern” basin-to-basin differences started during the latest Miocene and were fully developed in the Pliocene. The South Atlantic path for NCW also delivered heat to the Southern Ocean, facilitating sea ice changes, as indicated by biosiliceous patterns. These tectonic boundary changes and their affects on surface and deep water circulation contributed to the Pliocene pause in global cooling that began in the middle Miocene.",

            "abstract": "The Philippines is considered as a major tuna producer in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, both for domestic consumption and on industrial scale. However, with the ever-increasing demand of growing population, it has always been a challenge to achieve sustainable fishing. The creation of satellite-derived potential fishing zone maps is a technology that has been adopted by advanced countries for almost three decades already and has led to reduction in search times by up to 40%. In this study, a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is developed to predict the distribution of the Yellowfin tuna species in seas surrounding the Philippines based on the Catch-Per-Unit-Effort (CPUE) index. Level 3 gridded chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are the main input parameters of the model. Chlorophyll-a is linked with the presence of phytoplankton, which indicates primary productivity and suggests potential regions of fish aggregation. Fish also prefers to stay in regions where the temperature is stable, thus the sea surface temperature fronts serve as a guide to locate concentrations of fish school. Historical monthly tuna catch data from Western and Central Pacific Commissions (WCPFC) is used to train the model. The resulting predictions are converted to potential fishing zone maps and are evaluated within and beyond the historical time range of the training data used. Diagnostic tests involving adjusted R2 value, GAM residual plots and root mean square error value are used to assess the accuracy of the model. The generated maps were able to confirm locations of known tuna fishing grounds in Mindanao and other parts of the country, as well us detect their seasonality and interannual variability. To improve the performance of the model, ancillary data such as surface winds reanalysis from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is also incorporated in the model. Results of the model are further analyzed by comparing the fish maps with the night fishing activities in the Philippine waters. This was done through the use of night light monthly images gathered by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric chemistry models must include a large number of processes to accurately describe the temporal and spatial behavior of atmospheric composition. They require a wide range of chemical and physical data (parameters) that describe elementary gas-phase and heterogeneous processes. The review and evaluation of chemical and physical data has, therefore, played an important role in the development of chemical models and in their use in environmental assessment activities. The NASA data panel evaluation has a broad atmospheric focus that includes Ox, O(1D), singlet O2, HOx, NOx, Organic, FOx, ClOx, BrOx, IOx, SOx, and Na reactions, three-body reactions, equilibrium constants, photochemistry, Henry’s Law coefficients, aqueous chemistry, heterogeneous chemistry and processes, and thermodynamic parameters. The 2015 evaluation includes critical coverage of ~700 bimolecular reactions, 86 three-body reactions, 33 equilibrium constants, ~220 photochemical species, ~360 aqueous and heterogeneous processes, and thermodynamic parameters for ~800 species with over 5000 literature citations reviewed. Each evaluation includes (1) recommended values (e.g. rate coefficients, absorption cross sections, solubilities, and uptake coefficients) with estimated uncertainty factors and (2) a note describing the available experimental and theoretical data and an explanation for the recommendation. This presentation highlights some of the recent additions to the evaluation that include: (1) expansion of thermochemical parameters, including Hg species, (2) CH2OO (Criegee) chemistry, (3) Isoprene and its major degradation product chemistry, (4) halocarbon chemistry, (5) Henry’s law solubility data, and (6) uptake coefficients. In addition, a listing of complete references with the evaluation notes has been implemented. Users of the data evaluation are encouraged to suggest potential improvements and ways that the evaluation can better serve the atmospheric chemistry community.",

            "abstract": "Bespoke modelling tools are often needed when planning future engineered interventions in the context of various climate, socio-economic and geopolitical futures. Such tools can help improve system operating policies or assess infrastructure upgrades and their risks. A frequently used approach is to simulate and/or optimise the impact of interventions in engineered systems. Modelling complex infrastructure systems can involve incorporating multiple aspects into a single model, for example physical, economic and political. This presents the challenge of combining research from diverse areas into a single system effectively.\nWe present the Pynsim ‘Python Network Simulator’ framework, a library for building simulation models capable of representing, the physical, institutional and economic aspects of an engineered resources system. Pynsim is an open source, object oriented code aiming to promote integration of different modelling processes through a single code library.\nWe present two case studies that demonstrate important features of Pynsim’s design. The first is a large interdisciplinary project of a national water system in the Middle East with modellers from fields including water resources, economics, hydrology and geography each considering different facets of a multi agent system. It includes: modelling water supply and demand for households and farms; a water tanker market with transfer of water between farms and households, and policy decisions made by government institutions at district, national and international level. This study demonstrates that a well-structured library of code can provide a hub for development and act as a catalyst for integrating models.\nThe second focuses on optimising the location of new run-of-river hydropower plants. Using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, this study analyses different network configurations to identify the optimal placement of new power plants within a river network. This demonstrates that Pynsim can be used to evaluate a multitude of topologies for identifying the optimal location of infrastructure investments.\nPynsim is available on GitHub or via standard python installer packages such as pip. It comes with several examples and online documentation, making it attractive for those less experienced in software engineering.",

            "abstract": " “Ophiolite conundrum” deals with the unresolved puzzle of the origin of ophiolite, whether they have primarily formed in mid-oceanic ridge (MOR) or supra subduction zone (SSZ) settings. This attracts considerable debate because most of the ophiolites are located along the present day suture zones. The Andaman Ophiolite is a Cretaceous complex that occurs on the Andaman accretionary prism of the Indian-Eurasian convergent plate boundary. Here, we present whole rock trace element and isotope (Sr-Nd) data from the crustal section of the ophiolite comprising of pillow basalt, basalt, dolerite and gabbro from Rutland Island, south and middle Andaman Islands. Trace element patterns for a majority of our samples show N-MORB affinity barring enrichments in Rb and Ba, which could be attributed to secondary alteration. Comparison of trace element patterns and isotopic compositions of these rocks (eNd (t = 95 Ma) = 7.5 to 9.4; 87Sr/86Sri = 0.703 to 0.704) with that of the 127- 64 Ma Indian Ocean MORB suggest strong similarities thus, implying that a large section of Andaman Ophiolite represents the subducting Indian Oceanic Plate. If so, then this ophiolite complex possibly represents an obducted Indian oceanic lithosphere that formed at the Indian Ocean MOR.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols play an important role in regulating the global radiative budget through direct and indirect effects. To date, the role of sea spray aerosols in modulating climate remains poorly understood. Here we present results from measurements performed at the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ Field Research Facility in Duck, North Carolina, USA. Aerosol mobility size distributions (10-600 nm), refractory black carbon (rBC) and scattering particle size distributions (200-620 nm), and size resolved cloud condensation nuclei distributions (.07% - .6% supersaturation) were collected at the end of a 560m pier. Aerosol characteristics associated with northerly, high wind speed (15+ m s-1) flow originating from an oceanic trajectory are contrasted with aerosol properties observed during a weak to moderate westerly flow originating from a continental trajectory. Both marine and continental air masses had aerosol with bi-modal number size distributions with modes centered at 30nm and 140nm. In the marine air-mass, the CCN concentration at supersaturation of 0.4%, total aerosol number, surface, and volume concentration were low. rBC number concentration (D > 200 nm) associated with the marine air-mass was an order of magnitude less than continental number concentration and indicative of relatively unpolluted air. These measurements are consistent with measurements from other coastal sites under marine influence. The relative proportion of Aitken mode size particles increased from 1:2 to 2:1 while aerosol surface area was < 25 µm2 cm-3, suggesting that conditions upwind were potentially conducive to new particle formation. Overall, these results will contribute a better understanding to composition and size variation of marine aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Two candidate Cascadia tsunami deposits are found in tidal marsh sediments near Lynch Cove, at the head of Hood Canal. The deposits are suggestive of tsunami deposits in their tabular form, distribution in the marsh, sediment type, and microfossil content. The deposits are traceable in channel bank exposures, dug pits, and sediment cores on the outer edges of the marsh, and thin landward to an inland extent of at least 200 m. The deposits are made up of mud to fine sand, and are similar in appearance and grain size to the broad adjacent tidal flat. The deposits also contain tidal flat diatoms, and are notably different from the diatoms in the marsh sediments below and above the deposits. Radiocarbon ages of plant fossils show that the younger deposit (Layer A) postdates A.D. 1680, and may therefore represent the A.D. 1700 Cascadia tsunami. The older deposit (Layer B) has a two sigma age of A.D. 1170-1220, which overlaps in time with coseismic subsidence at the mouth of the Columbia River (subsidence of Soil W, A.D. 1000-1190), and with adjusted age estimates for deep-sea turbidites (turbidite T3, A.D. 960-1180). It is unknown whether Cascadia subduction zone tsunamis have left a geological record in Puget Sound. A recent unpublished simulation by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA, of a Cascadia tsunami propagating into Puget Sound predicts maximum water levels of over 4 m for some high water “hot spots” at the heads of narrow waterways. The marsh near Lynch Cove is a simulation “hot spot” with predicted water levels over 3 m. Narrow, wave-amplifying waterways, together with an available sediment supply, and predicted high water levels suggest that Cascadia tsunamis could leave behind a geologic record in Puget Sound, given conditions favorable for deposit preservation. Alternatively, one or both of the deposits may represent tsunamis generated by slides or fault displacement in Hood Canal.",

            "abstract": "Particulate Matter (PM) generated from forest fires often lead to degraded visibility and unhealthy air quality in nearby and downstream areas. To provide near-real time PM information to the state and local agencies, the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS) operational HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model) smoke modeling system (NWS/HYSPLIT smoke) provides the forecast of smoke concentration resulting from fire emissions driven by the NWS North American Model 12 km weather predictions. The NWS/HYSPLIT smoke incorporates the U.S. Forest Service BlueSky Smoke Modeling Framework (BlueSky) to provide smoke fire emissions along with the input fire locations from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)’s Hazard Mapping System fire and smoke detection system. Experienced analysts inspect satellite imagery from multiple sensors onboard geostationary and orbital satellites to identify the location, size and duration of smoke emissions for the model. NWS/HYSPLIT smoke is being updated to use a newer version of USFS BlueSky. The updated BlueSky incorporates the Fuel Characteristic Classification System version 2 (FCCS2) over the continental U.S. and Alaska. FCCS2 includes a more detailed description of fuel loadings with additional plant type categories. The updated BlueSky also utilizes an improved fuel consumption model and fire emission production system. For the period of August 2014 and June 2015, NWS/HYSPLIT smoke simulations show that fire smoke emissions with updated BlueSky are stronger than the current operational BlueSky in the Northwest U.S. For the same comparisons, weaker fire smoke emissions from the updated BlueSky were observed over the middle and eastern part of the U.S. A statistical evaluation of NWS/HYSPLIT smoke predicted total column concentration compared to NOAA NESDIS GOES EAST Aerosol Smoke Product retrievals is underway. Preliminary results show that using the newer version of BlueSky leads to improved performance of NWS/HYSPLIT-smoke for June 2015. These results are partially due to the default fuel loading selected for Canadian fires that lead to stronger fire emissions there. The use of more realistic Canadian fuel loading may improve NWS/HYSPLIT smoke forecast.",

            "abstract": "We present a comparative study of three techniques used to estimate the scintillation index (m) using interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations carried out by the Big Scanning Array (BSA), that operates at a frequency of 111 MHz. These techniques are based on: rms analysis on-source and off-source (classic), Fourier and wavelet transforms. IPS data are analyzed separately for the period of low solar activity (2007-2009), and for the year 2013, near the solar activity maximum. Our results show that in general, these methods are equivalent. We analyze the radial dependence of scintillation index at meter wavelengths during these two periods. It is found that the observed radial dependence of scintillation index during both periods of the cycle 24 is more flat than the theoretical dependence expected for the case of solar wind spherical symmetry. This flattening can be explained in terms of the influence of the heliospheric current sheet during periods of low solar activity, and the influence of solar disturbances, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), for periods of high solar activity.",

Atomospheric environment has been seriously contaminated with airborne paticles, which is threatening human health.The harmful effects of aerosols are dependent on certain characteristics such as microphysical properties. However, few studsies have been carried out on morphological information contained on single atmospheric particles in this area.\nIn this study, we provide a detailed morphologically and chemically characterization of airborne particles collected at Panzhihua city in October, 2014, using a quantitative single particle analysis based on EPXMA.\nThe results indicate that based on their chemical composition, five major types of particles were identified. Among these, aluminosilicate particles have typical spherical shapes and are produced during the high-temperature combustion; Fe-containing particles contains high level of Mn, and more likely originated from mineralogical and steel industry; Si-containing particles can originate from mineralogical source; V-Ti-Mn-containing particles are also produced by steel industry; Ca-containing particles,these particles are CaCO3, mainly from the mining of limestone mine.

            "abstract": "Gas recovery from methane-bearing shale rocks receives currently a lot of attention. The permeability of these rocks is controlled by induced and/or pre-existing fractures, where flow and thus gas recovery is partly controlled by the roughness of fracture walls. In this study, we determine fracture roughness and geometry both of veins and decompression fractures of the Pomeronian shale from Poland, recovered from ~4 km depth. Since vein formation occurs at depth, the topography of the vein-rock interface is preserved even when samples are extracted from the subsurface. Here, we have imaged a series of shale sample in 3D using X-ray microtomography performed on a laboratory tomograph and on the beamline ID19 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Several voxel spatial sizes were used, in the range 0.2 to 20 micrometers, allowing a multi-scale analysis of these rocks. We also compare fracture and veins roughness values from tomography scans to results obtained using white light interferometry, where these different measurements provides us with information on how scale, resolution and method affect roughness values. The low resolution CT scans show a small but clear difference between the roughness of the vein-rock interface and decompression fractures, implying fracture origin is important in controlling final roughness. The first results on scans made at different resolution furthermore indicate that higher resolution shows higher roughness values, which implies that low resolution tomography alone cannot capture the complexity of these fine-grained rocks. The results from this study provide input for (reactive) flow models, to study how efficient gas recovery can be.",

            "abstract": "The trajectory of incoming storms from the Pacific Ocean has a strong impact on hydroclimate in the Pacific Northwest. Shifts between zonal and meridional flow are a key influence on drought and pluvial regimes in both the PNW and the western United States as a whole. Circulation-dependent variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation can be recorded and potentially reconstructed using δ18O records derived from tree-rings. Here we present isotopic records of δ18O and δ13C from ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) for the period 1950-2013 from six sites located in the lee of the Cascades in eastern Washington. Because of the orientation of the Cascades, zonal flow will result in an intensified rain shadow whereas meridional flow allows moisture to penetrate at a lower elevation leading to a lower rainout effect. This means zonal flow results in drier conditions in eastern Washington and the converse for meridional flow. We hypothesized that more depleted precipitation δ18O values will occur with periods of more zonal flow across the PNW and will be recorded by trees at our sites. Results show a strong relationship between our δ18O chronologies and winter precipitation (R = -0.50; p<0.001). δ13C chronologies from the same trees showed a relationship to prior fall/winter (pOct-pDec) precipitation (R = -0.46; p<0.005) suggesting a possible link to antecedent moisture conditions. With a focus on years with clear zonal and meridional flow regimes, we regressed the tree-ring δ18O anomaly against the instrumental record of total precipitation and compared the residual series to records of storm track for the period 1978-2008, and we found a detectable signal where the most depleted δ18O was generally associated with zonal flow and the most enriched δ18O with meridional flow. However, there are still some years where the relationship is unclear. Further work is aimed at understanding these anomalous years and extending our record beyond the instrumental period.",

            "abstract": "A “Digital Divide” has long stood between how NASA and other satellite-derived data are typically archived (time-step arrays or \"maps\") and how hydrology and other point-time series oriented communities prefer to access those data. In essence, the desired method of data access is orthogonal to the way the data are archived. Our approach to bridging the Divide is part of a larger NASA-supported “data rods” project to enhance access to and use of NASA and other data by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) and the larger hydrology community. Our main objective was to determine a way to reorganize data that is optimal for these communities. Two related objectives were to optimally reorganize data in a way that (1) is operational and fits in and leverages the existing Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) operational environment and (2) addresses the scaling up of data sets available as time series from those archived at the GES DISC to potentially include those from other Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) data archives. Through several prototype efforts and lessons learned, we arrived at a non-database solution that satisfied our objectives/constraints. We describe, in this presentation, how we implemented the operational production of pre-generated data rods and, considering the tradeoffs between length of time series (or number of time steps), resources needed, and performance, how we implemented the operational production of on-the-fly (“virtual”) data rods. For the virtual data rods, we leveraged a number of existing resources, including the NASA Giovanni Cache and NetCDF Operators (NCO) and used data cubes processed in parallel. Our current benchmark performance for virtual generation of data rods is about a year’s worth of time series for hourly data (~9,000 time steps) in ~90 seconds. Our approach is a specific implementation of the general optimal strategy of reorganizing data to match the desired means of access. Results from our project have already significantly extended NASA data to the large and important hydrology user community that has been, heretofore, mostly unable to easily access and use NASA data.",

            "abstract": "Ocean-forced basal melting has been implicated in the widespread thinning of Antarctic ice shelves that has been causally linked with acceleration in the outflow of grounded ice. What determines the distribution and rates of basal melting and freezing beneath an ice shelf and how these respond to changes in the ocean temperature or circulation are therefore key questions.\nRecent years have seen major progress in our ability to observe basal melting and the ocean conditions that drive it, but data on the latter remain sparse, limiting our understanding of the key processes of ice-ocean heat transfer. In particular, we have no observations of current profiles through the buoyancy- and frictionally-controlled flows along the ice shelf base that drive mixing through the ice-ocean boundary layer. This presentation represents an attempt to address this gap in our knowledge through the application of a very simple model of such boundary flows that considers only the spatial dimension perpendicular to the boundary.\nResults indicate that for the purely buoyancy-driven flow two possible regimes exist: a weakly-stratified, geostrophic cross-slope current with an embedded Ekman layer; or a strongly-stratified upslope jet with weak cross-slope flow. The latter regime, while well-known to students of katabatic winds, has no analogue in the ocean, and is most appropriate when the ice-ocean interface is very steep. For the gentle slopes typical of ice shelves the buoyant Ekman regime provides some useful insight. When combined with a background flow a range of possible near-ice current profiles emerges as a result of arrest or enhancement of the upslope Ekman transport. Furthermore a simple expression for the upslope transport can be formed that is analogous to that for the wind-forced surface Ekman layer, with the curvature of the ice shelf base replacing the wind-stress curl in driving Ekman pumping to and from the geostrophic flow.",

China\n  Indonesian throughflow (ITF) is one of the most important currents responsible for transporting heat and moisture from the western Pacific to the Indian Oceans. The ITF is also well-known as effectively in modulating the global climate change with the interactions among ENSO and Asian monsoons. Here we present an AMS 14C dating controlled sea surface temperature (SST) record from core SO184-10043 (07°18.57′S, 105°03.53′E), which was retrieved from 2171m water depth at a north-south depression located at the southeastern offshore area of Sumatera in the eastern Indian Ocean. Based on our high-resolution SST using Mg/Ca analyses based on planktonic foraminifera shells of Globigerinoides ruber and alkenone index, U k’37-SST, oxygen isotope stratigraphy, and AMC 14C age-controls, our records show that, during the past 32,000 years, the SSTs were decreased which imply weaker ITF during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 and 3. The weaker UTF may respond to strengthened northeast monsoon during the boreal winter. During 21 to 15ka, the southeast monsoon had been stronger and the northeast monsoon was relatively weaker. During 15 to 8ka, rapid sea level rising may allow the opening of the gateways in the Makassar Strait and Lombok Strait that may have further strengthened the ITF. During the early Holocene, the northeast and southeast monsoons seem to be both strengthened. We will discuss the implications of the hydrographic variability and their age uncertainties in this paper during the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Since early 2000s, starting with NASA MODIS, satellite based remote sensing has facilitated collection of imagery with medium spatial resolution but high temporal resolution (daily). This trend continues with an increasing number of sensors and data products. Increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of remotely sensed data archives, from both public and commercial sources, have significantly enhanced the quality of mapping and change data products. However, even with automation of such analysis on evolving computing platforms, rates of data processing have been suboptimal largely because of the ever-increasing pixel to processor ratio coupled with limitations of the computing architectures. Novel approaches utilizing spatiotemporal data mining techniques and computational architectures have emerged that demonstrates the potential for sustained and geographically scalable landscape monitoring to be operational. We exemplify this challenge with two broad research initiatives on High Performance Geocomputation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory: (a) mapping global settlement distribution; (b) developing national critical infrastructure databases. Our present effort, on large GPU based architectures, to exploit high resolution (1m or less) satellite and airborne imagery for extracting settlements at global scale is yielding understanding of human settlement patterns and urban areas at unprecedented resolution. Comparison of such urban land cover database, with existing national and global land cover products, at various geographic scales in selected parts of the world is revealing intriguing patterns and insights for urban assessment. Early results, from the USA, Taiwan, and Egypt, indicate closer agreements (5-10%) in urban area assessments among databases at larger, aggregated geographic extents. However, spatial variability at local scales could be significantly different (over 50% disagreement).",

Phase II helped T-riders appreciate the relevancy of climate change to the local environment of Boston (4 months). Phase III engaged Bostonians with an array of hopeful examples of how people, companies, and organizations are effectively creating a more sustainable future (5 months). The focus of this presentation will be on the relationships that emerged from the work that went into Phase III.\nEngaging urban populations with climate change science is a difficult challenge since cities seem so removed from the ‘natural environment.’ However, mass transit provides an inherent means of communicating environmental messages with a cross section of the urban population. Our team felt that any messaging curriculum for an urban subway system must complement the scary reality of a changing climate with hopeful solutions that exist for dealing with it effectively. Urban areas such as Boston must develop adaptation and mitigation strategies that will help them not only survive, but thrive in a changing environment. Making our audience aware of the amazing efforts in this area was the goal of Phase III.\nThere were three parts to our efforts: the signage on the subway, above ground ostriches, and social events. During the presentation, we will describe ScienceToGo.org and explore the various theories that help explain why Phase III was successful at building alliances among more than three dozen diverse urban partners. Finally, we will conclude with some recommendations for how this work could improve and inform other urban informal science learning initiatives.",

            "abstract": "The process of hydraulic fracturing in shale gas formations typically involves the injection of large quantities of water-based fluid (2×107L typical) into the shale formations in order to fracture the rock. A large proportion of the fracturing fluids injected into shale gas wells during hydraulic fracturing does not return out of the well once production begins. The percentage of water returning varies within and between different shale plays, but is generally around 30%. The large proportion of the fluid that does not return raises the possibility that it could migrate out of the target shale formation and potentially toward aquifers and the surface through pathways such as the created hydraulic fractures, faults and adjacent wells. A leading hypothesis for the fate of the remaining fracturing fluid is that it is spontaneously imbibed from the hydraulic fractures into the shale rock matrix due to the low water saturation and very high capillary pressure in the shale. The imbibition hypothesis is assessed using numerical modeling of the two-phase flow of fracturing fluid and gas in the shale during injection. The model incorporates relevant two-phase physical phenomena such as capillarity and relative permeability, including hysteretic behavior in both. Modeling scenarios for fracturing fluid injection were assessed under varying conditions for shale reservoir parameters and spatial heterogeneities in permeability and wettability. The results showed that the unaccounted fracturing fluid may plausibly be imbibed into the shale matrix under certain conditions, and that significant small-scale spatial heterogeneity in the shale permeability likely plays an important role in imbibing the fracturing fluid.",

            "abstract": "In the current context of the ocean deoxygenation, OMZs are known to play a key-role on the evolution of climate (greenhouse gases) and on the ecosystems and fisheries (nitrogen loss, respiratory barrier, sulfidic events) at both local and global scales. One of the objectives of the AMOP (Activities of research dedicated to the Minimum of Oxygen in the eastern Pacific) project is to document the mechanisms associated with the OMZ variability from hourly to decadal timescales. The hypothesis is that the variability scale ranges are different at the oxycline compared to the OMZ core, and directly impact the OMZ recycling behavior acting as either a preservation or remineralization layer. Results from a mooring deployment off Callao put in evidence three main time scales of OMZ variability- intra daily, intra monthly and intra seasonally. A coupled model ROM-BioEBUS configuration of the Peruvian OMZ shows there is a marked longitudinal variability in the characteristics of the oxygen spectrum, indicative of a strong influence of mesoscale activity in shaping the OMZ structure offshore. Mooring data highlight oxygenation events occurring near the oxycline rather than within the core, and inducing a shift of the OMZ regime from organic matter preservation towards remineralisation.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of sulfur isotopes in the environment is controlled by fractionations imparted during microbial sulfate reduction that commonly range between 19‰ and 66‰. In addition, microbial sulfide oxidation and subsequent disproportionation of intermediate phases of sulfur may contribute to the net isotopic offset observed between sulfate and sulfide. Thus, it has been proposed that the cycling of sulfur, comprising repeated cycles of reduction, oxidation, and disproportionation, is responsible for producing offsets up to 65‰ between the δ34S values of sulfate and sulfide. Such large fractionations are often observed in nature though disproportionation is not necessarily required to produce such large offsets. To address these questions, we report on initial results from inorganic sulfur cycling in the water column and pore waters of euxinic Fayetteville Green Lake (FGL), New York. Water column samples were collected during the day when phototrophic sulfide oxidation is likely active and during the night when chemolithotrophy is likely operative. The sulfur isotopic offsets between sulfate and sulfide at the sediment water interface (57‰) are strikingly similar to those reported for the bottom waters of FGL (55‰; Zerkle et al., GCA, 4953-4970, 2010). The offset increases to nearly 70‰ at 25 cm within the sediments, suggesting ongoing microbial sulfur cycling or possibly differential diffusion during sulfate reduction within the sediments. We will compare the day/night isotope patterns with those of the pore waters to focus on the net isotope effects of sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture content (SMC) is a key variable for water budget and controls both physical processes, as runoff generation, and biological processes, as vegetation development. On the other hand, vegetation and land management influence soil evolution and therefore SMC dynamic. Moreover, in mountain areas complex topography adds an additional control on water fluxes and climate. For those reasons, understanding the controls on the spatio-temporal variability of SMC is essential to predict how perturbations in vegetation and climate affects mountain hydrology.\nIn this contribution we want to analyze the impact of different land management (meadows versus pastures) on the spatial and temporal dynamic of surface and root-zone SMC, and its relationships with climate and topography. We focus on water-limited alpine grasslands in the LTER area Mazia Valley in the European Alps. The infrastructure includes a dense network of more than 20 stations measuring soil moisture, biomass production observations and two eddy-covariance stations over meadow and pasture. Moreover, more than ten high-resolution SAR (Sentinel1 and RADARSAT2) images were acquired, in combination with ground surveys to monitor SMC spatial distribution. In order to understand the different physical controls, SMC has been also modelled using the GEOtop hydrological model, coupled with a dynamic vegetation model.\nResults show that meadows and pastures have different behaviors. Meadows are in general wetter and in flatter locations. This leads to higher vegetation productivity, development of soils with higher water holding capacity and to a positive feedback on SMC. In contrast, pastures are drier, in steeper locations with lower vegetation density and more compact soils due animal trampling, with a negative feedback on SMC. This co-evolution of land cover and SMC leads to persistent spatial patterns controlled by both topography and management.",

            "abstract": "In 2011, DOE launched the SunShot Initiative to reduce the total cost of solar energy systems by about 75% to make them cost competitive with other forms of energy (without subsidies) by 2020. This translates to a total cost of installed solar energy at $1/Watt or $0.06/kWh, incentivizing high penetration of solar on the utility grid. In the past four years, the SunShot Initiative has catalyzed revolutionary advancements in solar technologies, stimulating significant growth and accelerating deployment of solar energy systems. However, as solar deployment increases, integrating solar energy into the utility grid poses difficult challenges due to the variability in solar resource and the impact of clouds and aerosols on surface irradiance. Accurate forecasting of solar resource and its variability at high temporal and spatial resolution at least a day ahead is crucial to large scale integration of solar energy into the utility grid. However, this is limited by current errors in forecasting that are as high as 25% for clear sky forecasts of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), and as large as 40-80% for cloudy conditions. Forecasting errors are even higher for the direct normal irradiance (DNI).   For solar energy to be seamlessly integrated into the utility grid under the scenarios of high penetration of solar, significant improvements in surface solar irradiance modeling and observations of both Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) are essential to accurately predict power outputs from photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. Furthermore, forecasting improvements have to be closely tied to utility needs and operation timelines. Details about the ongoing research efforts supported through the SunShot initiative and the challenges and needs for solar forecasting improvements in regards to the SunShot Initiative will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the response of stomatal conductance to increasing anthropogenic CO2 is of critical importance for the evaluation of the global hydrological cycle, and has implications for future climate change, particularly flood and risk. Via physiological and morphological changes in leaf structure, stomatal conductance has been shown to decrease under elevated CO2 conditions, stimulating higher vegetation water use efficiency and water retention within the land system. However, an assessment of how the simulation of changing stomatal conductance in an Earth System Model compares with observational data under varying CO2 concentrations (Free Air CO2 Enrichment - FACE - studies) has not yet been conducted, and is crucial for considering the significance of the issue of flooding for global policy making. Here we utilise the Community Land Model, Version 4.5 (CLM4.5), performing climate simulations over a range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 350ppm to 700ppm (50ppm increments), and compare the model data with results from a conclusive set of FACE studies (350ppm – 700ppm range). We show general agreement between the climate model and FACE data with regards to decreasing stomatal conductance in response to increasing CO2 concentration. However the magnitudes of the conductance changes differ, spatially within the model, and across species in the FACE studies. We show how the model can be used to assess global stomatal conductance changes on spatial scales where FACE cannot (ie. most FACE studies are located across the 30°- 60° latitude belt). This is useful for understanding the role of groundwater retention and potential flood risk at regional scales across the globe. Additionally the model demonstrates seasonal-spatial changes in stomatal conductance in response to CO2 forcing. Such seasonal changes are generally absent throughout FACE studies, as measurement is predominantly tasked during summer months. Our results reiterate the importance of climate models in the assessment of future vegetation induced flood risk, especially since FACE studies are thus far limited to maximum CO2 concentrations of ~700ppm.",

In semi-arid and arid environments, many grasslands with protected surfaces are being replaced by heterogeneous shrub communities with bare, susceptible soil surfaces between the individual shrubs. The development of nutrient islands and the increases of fugitive dust in these areas is indicative of increases of soil redistribution, but few quantitative measurements have been made to date. We fenced three 1 ha areas in an approximately 100 ha coppice dune area of southeast New Mexico dominated by shinnery oak, sand sage, and mesquite and installed a 4 X 4 grid of MWAC sampler masts spaced at 20 m from each other. Weather data were collected at an automated weather station in each of the fenced areas. We found the patterns of soil redistribution to be highly variable in space and time. Differences in vegetation patterns and wind fields were noted among the plots for the same discrete time period that could explain some of the spatial variability. We also noted seasonality of wind fields that accounted for the temporally variable spatial patterns of soil redistribution. We conclude that accurate measurement of soil redistribution patterns in a heterogeneous shrub community requires a very large number of samplers and a long period of study and we believe that net soil loss from an area is limited to fine dust emissions.",

            "abstract": "The recent results from a linear Markov model for seasonal prediction of pan-Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) show that sea ice in the Pacific sector has the lowest predictability compared to other regions. One reason could be that the climate variability in the Atlantic sector is so dominant that other signals in the Arctic climate system do not appear in the leading modes used for model construction. This study develops a regional Markov model to improve seasonal forecasting of SIC in the Pacific sector. The model climate system consists of various combinations of the monthly mean series of SIC, sea surface temperature (SST), surface air temperature (SAT), pressure/geopotential height fields and winds at pressure levels. Multivariate empirical orthogonal functions (MEOF) and rotated MEOF are applied to each set of data to reduce the model dimensions. After a series of experiments, the final model configuration selects 23 rotated MEOF modes from a data matrix of three variables (SIC, SST and SAT). This regional model shows considerable improvement in the prediction skill in the Pacific sector in all seasons. The anomaly correlation skill increases by 0.2 at 1- to 4-month leads in the Bering Sea, and by 0.1 at 1- to 10-month leads in the Sea of Okhotsk. In general, the model performs better in summer and fall than in winter and spring. On average, the correlation skill can reach 0.6 at a 2-month (4-month) lead in the Bering Sea (the Sea of Okhotsk).",

            "abstract": "Climate change may induce shifts in species distributions and species richness patterns worldwide. The current distribution of global plant species richness can be reasonably well explained by climate and environmental predictors. Future projections from Global Climate Models (GCMs) concurrently indicate considerable possible shifts in water and energy related parameters such as temperature and precipitation within the 21stcentury, which may in turn have effects on the distribution of different vegetation zones worldwide and their potential to provide suitable habitats for species. In addition, the rate at which climatic conditions change within specific regions and the distance of suitable future climate analogues to recent conditions strongly influence the required species responses. Moreover, the ongoing transformation of natural habitats results in increasingly fragmented landscapes, which further limits the adaptive capacity of species to changing climate conditions in particular in terms of their ability to colonize new suitable habitats.\nWe present global predictions of the magnitude of possible shifts of plant species richness potential by the end of the century, based on empirical multi-variate relationships with water-energy dynamics and non-climatic predictor variables. We relate these outcomes to projected spatio-temporal dynamics of future climate conditions in relation to their recent analogues, and incorporate land use projections to derive a more comprehensive picture on interactions and trade-offs between these drivers than by separately looking at them.",

Among them, the key difficulties are the ability to deal with model errors, efficacy of uncertainty quantification and data assimilation.\nIn this presentation, we present three key ideas from learning and intelligent systems theory and apply them to two geophysical applications. The first idea is the use of Ensemble Learning to compensate for model error, the second is to develop tractable Information Theoretic Learning to deal with non-Gaussianity in inference, and the third is a Manifold Resampling technique for effective uncertainty quantification.\nWe apply these methods, first to the development of a cooperative autonomous observing system using sUAS for studying coherent structures. We apply this to Second, we apply this to the problem of quantifying risk from hurricanes and storm surges in a changing climate.\nResults indicate that learning approaches can enable new effectiveness in cases where standard approaches to model reduction, uncertainty quantification and data assimilation fail.",

            "abstract": "It is well documented that the Arctic has undergone rapid warming at an alarming rate over the past century. Black carbon (BC) affects the radiative balance of the Arctic directly and indirectly through the absorption of incoming solar radiation and by providing a source of cloud and ice condensation nuclei. Among atmospheric aerosols, BC is the most efficient absorber of light in the visible spectrum. The solar absorbing efficiency of BC is amplified when it is internally mixed with sulfates. Furthermore, BC plumes that are fossil fuel dominated have been shown to be approximately 100% more efficient warming agents than biomass burning dominated plumes. The renewal of offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, specifically in the Chukchi Sea, will introduce new BC sources to the region. This study focuses on the quantification of fossil fuel and biomass combustion sources to atmospheric elemental carbon (EC) during a year-long sampling campaign in the North Slope Alaska. Samples were collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) climate research facility in Barrow, AK, USA. Particulate matter (PM10) samples collected from July 2012 to June 2013 were analyzed for EC and sulfate concentrations combined with radiocarbon (14C) analysis of the EC fraction. Radiocarbon analysis distinguishes fossil fuel and biomass burning contributions based on large differences in end members between fossil and contemporary carbon. To perform isotope analysis on EC, it must be separated from the organic carbon fraction of the sample. Separation was achieved by trapping evolved CO2 produced during EC combustion in a cryo-trap utilizing liquid nitrogen. Radiocarbon results show an average fossil contribution of 85% to atmospheric EC, with individual samples ranging from 47% to 95%. Source apportionment results will be combined with back trajectory (BT) analysis to assess geographic source region impacts on the EC burden in the western Arctic.",

GeoMapApp (\nhttp://www.geomapapp.org\n), a free, map-based data discovery and visualisation tool developed with NSF funding at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory provides casual and specialist users alike with intuitive access to hundreds of built-in geoscience data sets covering geophysics, geochemistry, geology, oceanography, and cryospherics. Users can also import their own data tables, spreadsheets, shapefiles, grids, and images. Simple manipulation and analysis tools combined with layering capabilities and engaging visualisations provide a powerful app with which to explore and interrogate geoscience data in its proper geospatial context thus helping users to more easily gain deeper insight and understanding from real-world data.\nThe backbone of GeoMapApp is a regularly-updated multi-resolution elevation base map covering the oceans and continents and includes measurements ranging from Space Shuttle terrestrial data to ultra-high-resolution surveys of coral reefs and seafloor hydrothermal vent fields.\nExamples of built-in geophysical data sets include interactive earthquake locations and focal mechanism (CMT) solutions; underway cruise track profiles; plate tectonic velocities, seafloor crustal age and heat flow; multi-channel seismic reflection profiles; gravity, magnetic, and geoid anomalies; sidescan; subduction zone interface depths; and, EarthScope station locations. Dynamic links point to data sources and additional information. There are dedicated menus for GeoPRISMS, MARGINS, and Ridge2000 data sets. A versatile profiling tool provides instant access to data cross-sections, and contouring and 3-D views are also offered. Tabular data – both imported and built-in – can be displayed in a variety of ways and users can quickly select data points directly from the map. Layer opacity and on/off toggles allow easy data set comparisons.\nA new Save Session function is useful for collaboration and teaching. For example, educators can preserve a pre-loaded state of GeoMapApp, and, when shared with a class, the saved file allows every student to open GeoMapApp at exactly the same starting point from which to begin their data explorations.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of repeated imagery and ICESat laser altimetry has enabled the ongoing losses from the northern Larsen ice shelf remnant to be assessed in detail. The remnant, the Seal Nunataks ice shelf (SNIS), has four ICESat tracks that cross it as well as adjacent tracks that cross Robertson Island (RI) and its remaining tributary, Rogosh Glacier (RG), on the Antarctic Peninsula. The altimetry data from ICESat (2003-2009) shows that elevation losses increase from west to east across the SNIS. Ice elevation differences suggest mean ice shelf thinning rates of up to 1.6 m a-1 and reveal processes impacting the remaining shelf ice as well. Limited altimetry data across RG suggests elevation losses of almost 1 m a-1 inland from the grounding zone with smaller losses further up the evolving tributary. Farther east, asymmetric elevation changes across RI suggest the magnitude of regional climate impacts vary distinctly depending on slope aspect.\nImagery analysis using Landsat 7 and ASTER images from 2001-2013 shows that ice area losses continued on the shelf remnant following the Larsen A break up in 1995 as well as after the Larsen B break up in 2002. The largest losses (~350 km2) occurred on the north side of the remnant in late 2004 into 2005 with smaller losses along the remaining margins. Despite a slight regional cooling recently and more persistent sea ice since early 2008 as seen in MODIS imagery, the SNIS is still losing ice along its margins and appears to be retreating past its pinning nunataks. In contrast to SNIS, RI has experienced minor ice area losses that suggest most of its ice is grounded and thus less directly impacted by ocean interactions. Combining these remote sensing data sets provides additional insights about ongoing ice loss processes in this part of the Antarctic Peninsula.",

Namely, this suite utilizes a unique collection of the in-house developed 20+ shared libraries (NCEPLIBS), certain versions of the 3-rd party libraries (like netcdf, HDF, ESMF, jasper, xml etc.), HPC workflow tool within dedicated (sometimes even vendors’ customized) HPC system homogeneous environment. This domain and site specific, accompanied with NCEP’s product- driven large scale real-time data operations complicates NCEP collaborative development tremendously by reducing chances to replicate this OPS environment anywhere else.\nThe NOAA/NCEP’s Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) missions to develop and improve numerical weather, climate, hydrological and ocean prediction through the partnership with the research community. Realizing said difficulties, lately, EMC has been taken an innovative approach to improve flexibility of the HPC environment by building the elements and a foundation for NCEP OPS functionally equivalent environment (FEE), which can be used to ease the external interface constructs as well. Aiming to reduce turnaround time of the community code enhancements via Research-to-Operations (R2O) cycle, EMC developed and deployed several project sub-set standards that already paved the road to NCEP OPS implementation standards.\nIn this topic we will discuss the EMC FEE for O2R requirements and approaches in collaborative standardization, including NCEPLIBS FEE and models code version control paired with the models’ derived customized HPC modules and FEE footprints. We will share NCEP/EMC experience and potential in the refactoring of EMC development processes, legacy codes and in securing model source code quality standards by using combination of the Eclipse IDE, integrated with the reverse engineering tools/APIs. We will also inform on collaborative efforts in the restructuring of the NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS) – the multi- model and coupling framework, and transitioning FEE verification methodology.",

A preclinical SPECT-CT system (U-SPECT4CT, MILabs BV. Utrecht, The Netherlands) was evaluated for imaging flow and transport of 99mTc (t1/2=6hrs) using a 46,5mm by 156,4mm column packed with individual layers consisting of <0.2mm diameter silica gel, 0.2-0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0mm diameter glass beads, and a natural soil sample obtained from the Savannah River Site. The column was saturated with water prior to injecting the 99mTc solution. During the injection the flow was interrupted intermittently for 10 minute periods to allow for the acquisition of a SPECT image of the transport front. Non-uniformity of the front was clearly observed in the images as well as the retarded movement of 99mTc in the soil layer. The latter is suggesting good potential for monitoring transport processes occurring on the timescale of hours. After breakthrough of 99mTc was achieved, the flow was stopped and SPECT data were collected in one hour increments to evaluate the sensitivity of the instrument as the isotope decayed. Fused SPECT- CT images allowed for improved interpretation of 99mTc distributions within individual pore spaces.  With ~3 MBq remaining in the column, the lowest activity imaged, it was not possible to clearly discriminate any of the pore spaces.",

            "abstract": "A bridge vulnerability pilot study was conducted by Iowa Department of Transportation (IADOT) as one of nineteen pilots supported by the Federal Highway Administration Climate Change Resilience Pilots. Our pilot study team consisted of the IADOT senior bridge engineer who is the preliminary design section leader as well as climate and hydrological scientists. The pilot project culminated in a visual graphic designed by the bridge engineer (Figure 1), and an evaluation framework for bridge engineering design.\nThe framework has four stages. The first two stages evaluate the spatial and temporal resolution needed in climate projection data in order to be suitable for input to a hydrology model. The framework separates streamflow simulation error into errors from the streamflow model and from the coarseness of input weather data series.\nIn the final two stages, the framework evaluates credibility of climate projection streamflow simulations. Using an empirically downscaled data set, projection streamflow is generated. Error is computed in two time frames: the training period of the empirical downscaling methodology, and an out-of-sample period. If large errors in projection streamflow were observed during the training period, it would indicate low accuracy and, therefore, low credibility. If large errors in streamflow were observed during the out-of-sample period, it would mean the approach may not include some causes of change and, therefore, the climate projections would have limited credibility for setting expectations for changes.\nWe address uncertainty with confidence intervals on quantiles of streamflow discharge. The results show the 95% confidence intervals have significant overlap. Nevertheless, the use of confidence intervals enabled engineering judgement. In our discussions, we noted the consistency in direction of change across basins, though the flood mechanism was different across basins, and the high bound of bridge lifetime period quantiles exceeded that of the historical period. This suggested the change was not isolated, and it systemically altered the risk profile. One suggestion to incorporate engineering judgement was to consider degrees of vulnerability using the median discharge of the historical period and the upper bound discharge for the bridge lifetime period.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) show, among other features, the pristine interstellar neutral gas flow and additional populations associated with neutral helium and oxygen. Kubiak et al. (2014, ApJS, 213, 29) discovered the “Warm Breeze”, or additional He component, which is slower and warmer than the primary interstellar He population and its flow direction differs by about 19° from the interstellar neutral (ISN) flow. Park et al. (2015, ApJS, In Press) studied the combined count rate maps of heavy neutral atoms with three statistical analysis methods and found an extended tail of the ISN O flow, centered around 190° in ecliptic longitude and +15° in ecliptic latitude, or approximately 38° from the ISN O and Ne flow peak. The most likely sources for the Warm Breeze and the extended O tail may be secondary populations of interstellar He and O, created by charge exchange between ISN atoms and interstellar ions in the outer heliosheath. The charge exchange between interstellar He atoms and He+ ions is the most important reaction to generate the secondary neutral He in the outer heliosheath, with a reaction rate of 1.7×10-10 s-1 and a mean free path of ~950 AU. For O+, the charge exchange with interstellar H atoms with a rate ~1.0×10-9 s-1 and a mean free path of ~100 AU is most important. Because the differences in the reaction rates and atomic masses for He and O result in different velocity distributions in the outer heliosheath, the directional distributions of these populations at Earth orbit are not identical. In this study, we use the IBEX flux maps of the observed helium and oxygen atoms to compare their directional distributions. These observed distributions may provide constraints and information to improve our current understanding of the interactions in the outer heliosheath.",

            "abstract": "Lidar remote sensing of tropical forests provides unprecedented detail on 3D vegetation structure to support in-depth studies of ecosystem processes and carbon dynamics across large landscapes. Here, we used high-resolution, multi-temporal airborne lidar data from nine terra firme forest sites (total area = 3500 ha) in the Brazilian Amazon to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of forest disturbance and associated changes in canopy illumination. Across sites, we observed large variability in mean canopy height (15.7 m to 28.1 m) and the vertical distributions of forest vegetation and light penetration. At the site scale, lidar-derived canopy height models from repeat surveys showed minimal change in canopy structure over time intervals of 1 to 4 years, with nearly identical initial and final canopy height distributions. Annualized rates of total canopy turnover, based on losses in canopy height between lidar collections, ranged from 0.66 to 2.57% yr-1, with a mean value of 1.59% yr-1 across sites. Field estimates of tree crown sizes were used to classify canopy turnover into branch fall, tree fall and multiple tree fall events. Partial crown losses occurred most frequently across the landscape (40% of all events), but accounted for only a small fraction of the total turnover area (10%). Size-frequency distributions of canopy turnover followed a power-law distribution with a decline in the number of events with increasing size across all sites (range of λ between 1.26 - 1.35). The distributions of illumination conditions before and after disturbance events were inverted, as fully-illuminated crowns were replaced by low-light conditions within patches of canopy loss. Estimates of the spatial and temporal patterns of Amazon forest disturbance and recovery from multi-temporal lidar data complement information from plot-scale (≤ 1ha) studies to provide a more complete understanding of regional variability in ecosystem structure and function under current climate.",

To better understand the effect of variable solar wind conditions, we have conducted a variety of numerical experiments using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The solar wind input into the LFM simulation has been configured to contain an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) that starts at a steady southward IMF and suddenly turns northward for a brief period of time before turning back into a steady southward IMF. The height of the brief northward turning and the period of northward turning has been varied for each simulation run. Classically, the period of northward will greatly reduce energy dissipation in the ionosphere. When the northward IMF is flipped back to southward, the reduced dissipation lingers and causes the period of southward immediately following the northward IMF turning to also have less dissipation. With larger northward IMF magnitudes, the dissipation during southward is also correspondingly lower. We will present a detailed analysis of the magnetic topology for the period of southward immediately following the northward IMF turning and discuss a possible cause for this reduction in energy dissipation.",

The most recent devastating tsunamis occurred in 1946 in Dominican Republic; 1865 died. With the explosive increase in residents, tourists, infrastructure, and economic activity along the coasts, the potential for human and economic loss is enormous. It has been estimated that on any day, more than 500,000 people in the Caribbean could be in harm’s way just along the beaches, with hundreds of thousands more working and living in the tsunamis hazard zones. In 2005 the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission established the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami and other Coastal Hazards Warning System for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions (ICG CARIBE EWS) to coordinate tsunami efforts among the 48 participating countries in territories in the region.\nIn addition to monitoring, modeling and communication systems, one of the fundamental components of the warning system is community preparedness, readiness and resilience. Over the past 10 years 49 coastal communities in the Caribbean have been recognized as TsunamiReady® by the US National Weather Service (NWS) in the case of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and jointly by UNESCO and NWS in the case of the non US jurisdictions of Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. In response to the positive feedback of the implementation of TsunamiReady, the ICG CARIBE EWS in 2015 recommended the approval of the guidelines for a Community Performance Based Recognition program. It also recommended the adoption of the name “Tsunami Ready”, which has been positively consulted with the NWS. Ten requirements were established for recognition and are divided among Preparedness, Mitigation and Response elements which were adapted from the proposed new US TsunamiReady guidelines and align well with emergency management functions. Both a regional ICG CARIBE EWS and national/territorial “Tsunami Ready” boards will administer the recognition program. With the “Tsunami Ready” program, it will be possible for to better track the full implementation of tsunami warning system in the Caribbean and Adjacent regions. Member States and donor agencies have been invited to support pilot projects.",

            "abstract": "We study nonlinear elastic/acoustic phenomena in rocks at the laboratory scale, with the goal of understanding observations at crustal scales, for instance during strong ground motion and earthquake slip processes. In particular, a long-term goal is to relate microstructure of rocks/gouge to nonlinear acoustic properties. A dynamic perturbation with modest (i.e. acoustic) strain amplitude (10-6 < ε < 10-5) in rocks typically leads to a transient elastic softening (elastic modulus decrease) followed by a log(t)-relaxation back to the initial elastic modulus as soon as the excitation is turned off. The relaxation typically lasts from minutes to hours depending on rock type and amplitude/duration/frequency of perturbation. This log(t)-recovery implies that no characteristic time or rate can be extracted, i.e., the relaxation spectrum is flat. In this study, we use Dynamic Acousto-Elasticity (DAE) to probe the relaxation characteristics of a sample of Berea sandstone to explore short-term relaxation, down to 10-4s (DAE is the dynamic equivalent of measuring acoustic velocity as a function of applied pressure). We find that early recovery does not follow a logarithmic law, while some earlier studies based on resonance techniques and at times larger than 1s do exhibit log(t)-recovery. From this non-log(t) dataset, we extract a spectrum of relaxation rates and discuss the potential relation between characteristic rates and rock microstructure. We also discuss the possible links between transient elastic softening and transient increase in permeability due to dynamic perturbation.",

            "abstract": "Supercycles describe a long-term cluster of differently-sized megathrust earthquakes that consist of partial ruptures leading up to the final complete failure of a subduction zone segment. We recognize that supercycles are suggested to occur in those subduction zones (Sumatra, Japan, S-Chile, N-Central Chile, Colombia-Ecuador) for which the estimated seismogenic zone downdip width is larger than average (111 km). Here we provide an explanation for this potential link between the seismogenic zone downdip width and supercycles.\nWe use a two-dimensional, continuum-based seismo-mechanical model, which was recently validated through a comparison against scaled analogue subduction experiments. The setup consists of an upper plate represented by a visco-elastic wedge, which is underthrusted by a rigid plate. The megathrust is simulated by a layer governed by slip-rate dependent friction, in which the velocity-weakening seismogenic zone extends over a certain width and transitions up-and downdip to velocity-strengthening regions.\nIn our simulations, the first megathrust events in a supercycle generally rupture only the outermost parts of the seismogenic zone. These sub-critical and pulse-like ruptures are stopped due to a large excess of strength over stress, which leads to a transfer of stresses towards the centre of the seismogenic zone. In addition to the continued tectonic loading, they thereby gradually reduce the strength excess so that the largest megathrust events finally rupture the entire seismogenic zone in a crack-like manner and release most of the accumulated stress. A greater downdip width increases the average strength excess and thus favours supercycles over ordinary cycles of only similarly sized complete ruptures.\nWe conclude that such stress evolution along the dip of a wide seismogenic zone is the simplest mechanism governing supercycles. Additional a priori complexities, like previously suggested structural or frictional heterogeneities are not required to generate supercycles, although they are expected to add to our explanation. Our results imply that larger than thus far observed earthquakes could occur as part of a supercycle in subduction zones where downdip widths are larger than average such as in Alaska, Java, Antilles and Kamchatka.",

Basse-Terre Island is a volcanic chain that belongs to the Lesser Antilles active volcanic arc with a southward decreasing age of volcanism from 3 Ma to present day.We investigate records of vertical motion along Basse-Terre through a morphostructural analysis of the Pleistocene-Holocene shallow-water carbonate platforms and associated terraces that surround Basse-Terre Island. This study is based on new high-resolution bathymetric and dense seismic data acquired during the GEOTREF oceanographic survey (2015, February). Our bathymetric and topographic Digital Terrain Model together with the “Litto3D” Lidar data (IGN/SHOM) images the island topography and the platform bathymetry to a depth of 200m with horizontal and vertical resolutions of 5m and ~cm respectively. This detailed study highlights the morphostructure of terraces built during the last transgression in order to identify and quantify their vertical motions. We analyze inherited morphology and structures of the forearc that affect the platform to discuss effects of the regional tectonics context. A particular emphasis is put on the influence of the NW-SE arc parallel transtensive Montserrat-Bouillante fault system onto the platform geometry. At last, the distribution of Basse-Terre terraces is compared with terraces distribution around other Lesser Antilles island and the Bahamas stable margin platform. We aim at discriminating the influence of the Pleistocene global sea-level rise from the one of tectonic vertical deformations.",

            "abstract": "The climate elasticity based on the Budyko curves has been widely used to evaluate the hydrological responses to climate change. The Mezentsev-Choudhury-Yang formula is one of the representative analytical equations for Budyko curves. Previous researches mostly used the variation of runoff (R) caused by the changes of annual precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (ET0) as the hydrological response to climate change and evaluated it by a first-order approximation in a form of total differential, the major components of which include the partial derivatives of R to P and ET0, as well as climate elasticity on this basis. Based on analytic derivation and the characteristics of Budyko curves, this study proposed a modified formula of the first-order approximation to reduce the errors from the approximation. In the calculation of partial derivatives and climate elasticity, the values of P and ET0 were taken to the sum of their base values and half increments, respectively. The calculation was applied in 33 catchments of the Hai River basin in China and the results showed that the mean absolute value of relative error of approximated runoff change decreased from 8.4% to 0.4% and the maximum value, from 23.4% to 1.3%. Given the variation values of P, ET0 and the controlling parameter (n), the modified formula can exactly quantify the contributions of climate fluctuation and underlying surface change to runoff. Taking the Murray-Darling basin in Australia as an example of the contribution calculated by the modified formula, the reductions of mean annual runoff caused by changes of P, ET0 and n from 1895-1996 to 1997-2006 were 2.6, 0.6 and 2.9 mm, respectively, and the sum of them was 6.1 mm, which was completely consistent with the observed runoff. The modified formula of the first-order approximation proposed in this study can be not only used to assess the contributions of climate change to the runoff, but also widely used to analyze the effects of similar issues based on a certain functional relationship in hydrological and climate changes.",

            "abstract": "The 2012 High Park Fire (HPF) burned 330 km2 of Front Range forests surrounding the Cache la Poudre River just upstream of the municipal water supply intakes for the cities of Fort Collins and Greeley. From 2012-2014, millions of dollars were spent on mulch treatments to stabilize burned soils and protect water supplies. The objective of this research is to evaluate how runoff and sediment production vary with precipitation (P) on two unmulched and two mulched hillslopes of the HPF during the 2014 summer thunderstorm season. The four hillslopes are moderate to severely burned zero-order catchments 0.2-0.4 ha in area. Sediment fences were installed at the base of each hillslope to collect bedload sediment; each fence was fitted with a V-notch weir and a series of flow splitters to collect proportional samples of runoff and suspended sediment. Runoff and sediment were captured during 3-7 events for the unmulched sites and 1-9 events for the mulched sites; some P events that produced bedload sediment did not produce measurable runoff. The 30-minute maximum P intensity thresholds for runoff and sediment production were lower for unmulched (10 mm hr-1) than mulched hillslopes (16 mm hr-1). Runoff ratios were similar for the unmulched (0.01-0.10) and mulched sites (0.00-0.08), but total sediment yield (bedload + suspended load; Mg ha-1) for the unmulched sites was up to three times greater (0.02-1.54) than the mulched sites (0.01-0.50. The ratio of suspended sediment to bedload was similar for the unmulched (0.24-1.97) and mulched sites (0.16-2.52). The results of this research suggest that (1) bedload sediment measurements under-represent hillslope sediment production, and (2) mulching may reduce sediment production in zero-order catchments, but the magnitude of the mulch effect varies by catchment and by rain event.",

To achieve this, a catchment-scale study of the River Conwy (349 km2) in Wales is being done with emphasis on determining when, where and how coupled macronutrient (C, N, P) cycling occurs in the biogeochemical hot-spots of the soils, the riparian zone, instream and in the river-estuarine transition zone. A major integrated measurement programme is now largely complete. New data are being analysed to understand which soil properties have greatest influence on above and below-ground productivity including plant traits and how microbial processing is controlled by stoichiometry and nutrient priming. Within the stream network, new understanding is being produced on the in-river algal and whole ecosystem (metabolic) response to CNP additions and the factors affecting the fate and cycling of organic matter. In the estuary, initial results indicate a subsurface jet is causing stratification and a velocity anomaly has been observed. Both are important in terms of suspended matter transport and floc break-up. An integrated model is being built to describe the soil-atmosphere-vegetation processes which is linked, firstly, to flow and water quality models that describe the CNP flux transport and transformations from the headwaters to the estuary and, secondly, to biodiversity models. The purpose of the integrated model is to quantify how coupled CNP cycles may respond to environmental change and thereby affect C sequestration, water quality and biodiversity in the future. The team are now in the major phase of data synthesis and model development and are interested in linking with similar studies involving coupled CNP cycles across the atmospheric-terrestrial-freshwater-coastal continuum.",

We present the first version of the GOME-2 Metop-A degradation model which covers the full spectral range between 240 nm and 790 nm and also includes signal correction for two polarisation measurement devices (PMDs). We discuss the individual model components, including a correction of the solar-spectrum and the calibration of the solar diffuser, a stray-light correction in the region below 295 nm, an angular correction of all earthshine data, as well as a correction in the spectral domain for low frequency patterns. The first version of the dataset covers the time period from launch until the start of tandem operations in July 2013, when the swath of GOME-2 Metop-A was reduced from 1920 km to 960 km.\nWe will discuss the individual degradation components accounted for, their physical origin, and will show the first results of the corrected spectra and their impact on level-2 retrieval quality. We also present the roadmap towards the implementation of a near real-time correction scheme of GOME-2 level-1 data and discuss various options concerning its potential operational and offline functionalities.",

Through\ntheir thermal structure, dry layers inhibit vertical cloud development\nand deep convection. Subtropical dry layers play an important role in\nthe troposphere through radiative cooling.\nCase studies of tropical dry air intrusions have been conducted with\ndata from in-situ and remotely sensed observations as well as model\ndata. In this work we show that observations from GPS Radio\nOccultation (RO) are capable of detecting dry layers.\nGPS RO is a limb sounding technique that provides accurate and precise\nmeasurements of atmospheric refractivity, which is related to density,\nwith high vertical resolution and global coverage. Vertical profiles\nof water vapor pressure can be derived through a One-Dimensional\nVariation retrieval (1DVAR) using model data as the first guess.\nIn this work, we compare RO data from the COSMIC mission to aircraft\nmeasurements from the CONTRAST campaign, conducted from Guam in the\ntropical West Pacific during January and February 2014. We derived the\nrelative humidity from both data sets to investigate dry layers in the\nlower and mid troposphere.\nIt is shown that GPS RO observations have the ability to robustly\ndetect tropospheric dry layers with a relative humidity of only a few\npercent. Together with the high vertical resolution, global\navailability, and 14 years of GPS RO data record, this opens the\nopportunity to study the spatio-temporal pattern of dry layers\nglobally and their dependency on climatological phenomena such as El\nNiño–Southern Oscillation.",

            "abstract": "The Water Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) provides a comprehensive approach to developing water services in a way that ensures social equity, health, well-being and sustainability for all. In particular, the water goal includes targets related to sanitation, wastewater, water quality, water efficiency, integrated water management and ecosystems (details to be finalized in September 2015). As part of its implementation, methods to monitor target indicators must be developed. National governments will be responsible for reporting on progress toward these targets using national data sets and possibly information from global data sets that applies to their countries. Oversight of this process through the use of global data sets is desirable for encouraging the use of standardized information for comparison purposes.\nDisparities in monitoring due to very sparse data networks in some countries can be addressed by using geospatially consistent data products from space-based remote sensing. However, to fully exploit these data, capabilities will be needed to downscale information, to interpolate and assimilate data both in time and space, and to integrate these data with socio-economic data sets, model outputs and survey data in a geographical information system framework. Citizen data and other non-standard data types may also supplement national data systems. A comprehensive and integrated analysis and dissemination system is needed to enable the important contributions that satellites could make to achieving Water SDG targets.\nThis presentation will outline the progress made in assessing the needs for information to track progress on the Water SDG, options for meeting these needs using existing data infrastructure, and pathways for expanding the role of Earth observations in SDG monitoring. It will also discuss the potential roles of Future Earth’s Sustainable Water Futures Programme (SWFP) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) in coordinating these efforts.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of shale gas development facilitated by hydraulic fracturing it has become increasingly important to develop tracer tools to scientifically determine potential impacts of stray gases on shallow aquifers. To assess potential future impacts on shallow aquifers by leakage of natural gas from unconventional energy resource development, it is essential to establish a reliable baseline. Occurrence of methane in shallow groundwater in Alberta (Canada) between 2006 and 2014 was assessed and was ubiquitous in 186 sampled monitoring wells. Free and dissolved gas sampling and measurement approaches yielded comparable results with often low methane concentrations in shallow groundwater, but in 28 samples methane exceeded 10 mg/L in dissolved gas and 300,000 ppmv in free gas. Methane concentrations in free and dissolved gas samples were found to increase with well depth and were especially elevated in groundwater obtained from aquifers containing coal seams and shale units. Carbon isotope ratios of methane averaged -69.7 ± 11.1 ‰ in free gas and -65.6 ± 8.9 ‰ in dissolved gas. δ13C values were not found to vary with well depth or lithology indicating that the methane in Alberta groundwater was formed via a similar mechanism. The low δ13C values in concert with average δ2H values of -289 ± 44 ‰ suggest that most methane was of biogenic origin predominantly generated via CO2 reduction. This interpretation is confirmed by gas dryness parameters typically >500 due to only small amounts of ethane and a lack of propane in most samples. Novel approaches of in-situ concentration and isotope measurements for methane during drilling of a 530 m deep well yielded a mud-gas profile characterizing natural gas occurrences in the intermediate zone. Comparison with mudgas profile carbon isotope data revealed that methane in the investigated shallow groundwater in Alberta is isotopically similar to hydrocarbon gases found in 100-250 meter depths in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and is currently not sourced from thermogenic hydrocarbon occurrences in deeper portions of the basin. The assembled data set provides evidence that potential stray gas contamination by isotopically distinct deeper thermogenic gases from the intermediate or from production zones can be effectively detected by suitable monitoring programs.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this research is to use the inundation data available from 250 m Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Near Real Time (NRT) as supplementary data to quantify the signature of different levels of intra-monthly percentages of water-cover on spectral channels of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI). The analysis relies on an unsupervised clustering methodology, which uses information content of the magnitudes and polarization differences of all TMI channels. This clustering method is applied to the monthly averages of the spectral brightness temperatures in calendar year 2013, focusing on two important deltaic regions: Mekong and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna. The results illustrate that during the non-raining condition, the high-frequency brightness temperatures at 85V,H GHz can be used as a surrogate of inundation while for the “all-sky” condition, the low frequency channel of 10 GHz, is the one that is hardy influenced by atmospheric constituents but is not very suitable for the detection of small-feature inundation because of its coarse resolution.\nThe monthly inundation dynamics of the two aforementioned delta regions are demonstrated on each frequency channel separately and on the clusters of all TMI spectral channels for non-rainy and “all-sky” scenes. The mean and variance of the identified clusters are used to detect the inundated percentage in another deltaic region, the Yellow River delta, while the MODIS NRT data are exploited to characterize the error of inundation mapping.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are the landscape’s arteries; they convey water, solutes, energy, and living organisms from the hillslopes, floodplains, aquifers, and atmosphere to the oceans. As water moves along this complex circulatory system, it is continuously exchanged with the surrounding alluvial aquifer, termed hyporheic exchange, which strongly conditions and constrains the biogeochemical evolution of water at the local scale with basin-scale consequences. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have focused on the use of detailed mathematical models to explore the hydrodynamics and biogeochemical effect of hyporheic exchange at the scale of individual channel morphologies. While these efforts are essential to gain mechanistic understanding, their computational demand makes them impractical for basin applications. In this talk, a parsimonious but physically based model of hyporheic flow for application in large river basins is presented: Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS). At the core of NEXSS are the up-scaling of detailed mathematical models and a characterization of the channel geometry, geomorphic features, and related hydraulic drivers based on scaling equations from the literature and readily accessible information such as river discharge, width, grain size, sinuosity, channel slope, and regional groundwater gradients. As a proof-of-concept, we use NEXSS to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of hyporheic exchange and denitrification potential along the Mississippi River basin. This modeling approach allows us to map the location of critical hot spots for biogeochemical transformation, their geomorphic drivers, and cumulative effect. Finally, we discuss new avenues to incorporate exchange with floodplains and ponded waters, which also play a key role in water quality along the river corridor. This new modeling approach is critical to transition from purely empirical continental models of water quality to hybrid approaches that incorporate fundamental physics and take advantage of available hydrogeomorphic data. In particular, hybrid models will be instrumental for predicting outcomes of river basin management practices under present and future socio-economic and climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Brazil is the world largest sugarcane producer, with a cropped area of approximately 10 million hectares. Soil erosion and its implications are some of the neglected environmental problems in sugarcane fields. In this study a plot of 6 hectares cropped with sugarcane, encompassing a 30 meters of riparian forest bordering a stream was chosen. Two pluviometers were installed in an open area in order to measure the amount and intensity of rain during the rainy season. Surface runoff generation and soil detachment were estimated by plots installed in cultivated and riparian areas. Bathymetry was carried out in the stream channel to estimate the soil mass settled on the stream bed. The sources of organic matter was investigated by carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotopic compositions. In the earlier stages of the crop, the rain intensity strongly influenced runoff generation and soil detachment; that were minimized with the plant growth. In riparian areas, runoff and soil detachment occurred only during intense events. The total rainfall was approximately 1300 mm, in one slope of the sugarcane field, approximately 5% of this rainfall drained from the watershed as surface runoff; in the other slope this proportion increased to approximately 11%, and in the riparian forest decreased to less than 2%. The soil detachment was approximately 1,000 g.m-2 in one sugarcane slope, and increased to approximately 4,800 g m-2 in the other slope, decreasing in the riparian forest to only 50 g m-2. The difference in runoff and soil detachment observed between the two sugarcane slopes was due to the sugarcane growth stage and soil properties. Using the bathymetry conducted in the stream channel, we estimated that 3.6 Mg of sediment per hectare were settled on the stream bed during the rainy season (0.6 Mg.ha-1 per month). The averages δ13C and δ15N of soil from forest areas were -27.6 ± 0.2 ‰ and 4.3 ± 0.4 ‰, respectively. In the sugarcane areas, the averages δ13C and the δ15N increased to -20.4 ± 0.2 ‰ and 6.8 ± 0.1 ‰, respectively. In the stream bed, the average δ13C was equal to -23.2 ± 0.2 ‰ and the average δ15N equal to 5.9 ± 0.1 ‰, indicating that at least 60% of this material was generated in the sugarcane areas.",

            "abstract": "Instrumental and historical records of earthquakes, supplemented by paleoeseismic constraints can help reveal the earthquake potential of an area. The Pasuruan fault is a high angle normal fault with prominent youthful scarps cutting young deltaic sediments in the north coast of East Java, Indonesia and may pose significant hazard to the densely populated region. This fault has not been considered a significant structure, and mapped as a lineament with no sense of motion. Information regarding past earthquakes along this fault is not available. The fault is well defined both in the imagery and in the field as a ~13km long, 2-50m-high scarp. Open and filled fractures and natural exposures of the south-dipping fault plane indicate normal sense of motion. We excavated two fault-perpendicular trenches across a relay ramp identified during our surface mapping. Evidence for past earthquakes (documented in both trenches) includes upward fault termination with associated fissure fills, colluvial wedges and scarp-derived debris, folding, and angular unconformities. The ages of the events are constrained by 23 radiocarbon dates on detrital charcoal. We calibrated the dates using IntCal13 and used Oxcal to build the age model of the events. Our preliminary age model indicates that since 2006±134 B.C., there has been at least five ground rupturing earthquakes along the fault. The oldest event identified in the trench however, is not well-dated. Our modeled 95th percentile ranges of the next four earlier earthquakes (and their mean) are A.D. 1762–1850 (1806), A.D. 1646–1770 (1708), A.D. 1078–1648 (1363), and A.D. 726–1092 (909), yielding a rough recurrence rate of 302±63 yrs. These new data imply that Pasuruan fault is more active than previously thought. Additional well-dated earthquakes are necessary to build a solid earthquake recurrence model. Rupture along the whole section implies a minimum earthquake magnitude of 6.3, considering 13km as the minimum surface rupture length.",

Recent assessments indicate that the probability distribution of the contribution of ice sheet mass loss may well be distributed asymmetrically towards higher projections. In this study we present the consequence of this asymmetry for high-end regional sea level projections. These estimates include gravitational and rotational effects as well as variability caused directly by climate change.\nResults show that the global average 95% confidence interval for sea level shifts to 26 cm higher values, compared to symmetrical distribution based on the IPCC AR5 report. Regionally both lower (near ice sheets) and higher values (more than 60 cm for the east coast US for the 95% confidence interval) are possible depending on the location with respect to ice loading changes. Results diverge even more for higher confidence levels and hence this effect is of large importance for coastal defences as flood risks may increase considerably.",

            "abstract": "Recent Van Allen probe measurements have shown that the flux of ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt is highly variable. Here we use a ULF wave radial diffusion model driven by global ground magnetometer measurements of ULF waves coupled with electron loss models due to chorus and hiss waves to simulate an unusually long electron flux drop out event, which lasted for over 10 days during the September 2014 storm. The simulation results are in remarkable agreement with the ultra-relativistic flux measurements from the Van Allen Probes, and demonstrate the critical role played by dynamical variations in the source population at the outer boundary. For this storm, following the initial loss of ultra-relativistic electrons, the flux remains low for 10 days. Throughout the extended drop out interval, the flux dynamics can be explained by the coupling of the radiation belt flux and the outer boundary electron source population through the action of ULF wave transport. In particular we highlight the surprising result that the pre- and post-storm radiation belt flux are decoupled, such that post-onset flux dynamics including during the 10 day low flux interval as well as the eventual recovery can be explained by ULF wave transport. Significantly, our modeling results show that the overall post-onset ultra-relativistic flux dynamics can be explained without any contribution from the pre-storm flux.",

Ikari et al. (2011) indicated that the transitions of frictional parameters obtained from the rate and state dependent friction law involve shear localization. However, the underlining theoretical background for their link has been unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigate their relation theoretically and experimentally based on Rowe’s theory on constant minimum energy ratio (Rowe, 1962) describing particle deformations quantitatively by energetic analysis. In theoretical analysis using analytical dynamics and irreversible thermodynamics, the energetic criterion about frictional instability is obtained; unstable slip occurs at energy ratios below 1. In friction experiments using a gas medium apparatus, simulated fault gouge deforms obeying the Rowe’s theory. Additionally, the energy ratios change gradually with shear and show below 1 before the occurrence of unstable slip. Moreover, energy ratios are derived from volume changes. Transition of energy ratios from increase to decrease, which has been confirmed at the end of compaction, indicates the onset of volume increase toward the occurrence of unstable slip. The volume increases likely correspond to the formation of R1-shears with open mode character, which occurs prior to the unstable slip. Shear localization leads to a change in internal friction angle which is a statistical parameter to constitute a energy ratio. In short, changes in internal friction angle play an important role in evolving from being frictionally stable to unstable. From these results, the physical and energetic background for their link between the frictional parameter and shear localization becomes clear.",

            "abstract": "Flooding is the leading cause of death from natural disasters and poses public health and economic risks to developed and developing cities. In order to better assess these risks, models of flooding need to rely on modern, up-to-date information about urban environments. Approaches based on traditional grids are computationally expensive because of the restriction of the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy condition. This condition introduces a resolution dependency into hydrodynamic models, affecting a number of states such as velocity and water depth, and therefore may impact management and design decisions, becoming a serious weakness in real-time situations.\nThis research links watershed processes to the urban environment by applying an upscaling method that relies on fine-scale information on elevation, roughness, land cover, and soil moisture. The benefit of this approach is that it reduces resolution dependency, allowing for the calculation of hydrodynamic variables at subgrid scales. This approach negates the need for grid refinement in complex geometries and surface conditions of the urban interface, improving the computational efficiency for simulating and predicting flooding events.",

In this experiment, we are investigating space-time downscaling of precipitation using NCEP CPC’s one of the latest precipitation data sets, which has utilized a long-term climatology of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) estimated from satellite observations to produce a blended precipitation product. This data set is 0.25-degree at a daily interval, which we downscale to hourly interval in time and approximately 3-km resolution in space through a hybrid-stochastic precipitation downscaling method. The downscaling model is an integration of random cascade disaggregation and two-dimensional translation model.

A number of events with clear Earth-like growth phase and expansion phase signatures were found. The thinning of the plasma sheet and the increase of magnetic field intensity in the lobe were observed during the growth phase and plasma sheet was observed to thicken during the expansion phase, which are similar to the observations at Earth. But the time scale of Mercury’s substorm is only several minutes comparing with the several hours at Earth [Sun et al., 2015a]. Detailed analysis of magnetic field fluctuations during the substorm expansion phase have revealed low frequency plasma waves, e.g. Pi2-like pulsations. The By fluctuations accompanying substorm dipolarizations are consistent with pulses of field-aligned currents near the high latitude edge of the plasma sheet. Further study shows that they are near-circularly polarized electromagnetic waves, most likely Alfvén waves. Soon afterwards the plasma sheet thickened and MESSENGER detected a series of compressional waves. We have also discussed their possible sources [Sun et al., 2015b].\nSun, W.-J., J. A. Slavin, S. Y.

            "abstract": "A major challenge in forest management is the inaccessibility of large swaths of land, which makes accurate monitoring of forest change difficult. Remote sensing methods can help address this issue by allowing investigators to monitor remote or inaccessible regions using aerial or satellite-based platforms. However, most remote sensing methods do not provide a full three-dimensional (3D) description of the area. Rather, they return only a single elevation point or landcover description. Multiple-return LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) gathers data in a 3D point cloud, which allows forest managers to more accurately characterize and monitor changes in canopy structure and vegetation-type distribution. Our project used high-resolution aerial multiple-return LiDAR data to determine vegetation canopy structures and their spatial distribution in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. To ensure sufficient data density and to match LANDSAT resolution, we gridded the data into 30m x 30m cells. The LiDAR data points within each cell were then used to generate the vertical canopy structure for that cell. After vertical profiles had been created, we used a k-means cluster analysis algorithm to classify the landscape based on the canopy structure. The spatial distribution of distinct and unique canopy structures was mapped across the park and compared to a vegetation-type map to determine the correlation of canopy structure to vegetation types. Preliminary analysis conducted at a number of phenology sites maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont shows strong correspondence between canopy structure and vegetation type. However, more validation is needed in other regions of the park to establish this method as a reliable tool. LiDAR data has a unique ability to map full 3D structures of vegetation and the methods developed in this project offer an extensible tool for forest mapping and monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Typical natrocarbonatite eruption temperatures are 490-595°C and are at least 200-300°C lower than temperatures for any suitable silicic liquid that could be conjugate across a miscibility gap. In particular, the 2007 Oldoinyo Lengai (OL) eruption delivered a mix of nephelinitic and carbonatite melts, supporting the commonly accepted supposition that carbonatites are conjugate to spatially associated peralkaline nephelinites. We constrain possible parental melt compositions of the natrocarbonatites by saturation with calcite, apatite, cpx, wollastonite, nepheline, combeite or nyerereite (at 1 kbar, 650-1200°C, fast-quench cold-seal vessels); all occurring in the silicate or carbonatite rocks of OL The results show that the natrocarbonatite is highly undersaturated in calcite and apatite. At 1200°C, calcite saturation results in decreasing Na2O+K2O from initially 41.5 to 10.3 wt% while the CaCO3-component is increased to 80 wt%. In the complex system, there is no thermal (nyerereite-fairchildite) maximum, hence fractionation of calcite+apatite may proceed from a parent melt with 15 wt% alkali and 70% Ca-component to the observed OL natrocarbonatites. The observed melt inclusions in phenocrysts in the nephelinites at Keramasi (Guzmics et al. 2012, CMP) would serve as ideal parents, these melt compositions correspond to 1050oC. The modelled liquid line of descent along the calcite surface requires a total fractionation of ~48% calcite and ~9 wt% apatite. SiO2 solubility only increases from 0.2-2.9 wt% at 750-1200°C, leaving little leeway for reaction with silicates. A peritectic reaction among the above silicates conserving the Si-content in the carbonatite could not be identified. At >950°C cpx yields, through peritectic melting, an immiscible peralkaline silicate melt + extensive wollastonite (as observed in OL cumulates). This experimental silicate melt resembles the unusual silicate ash compositions from the 2007 eruption. The natrocarbonatite lavas from OL are not conjugate liquids to spatially associated nephelinite or phonolite melt. Saturation of the carbonatite with the minerals saturated in these silicate melts at the time of immiscibility yields a Na-K-rich calciocarbonatite parent, while the observed natrocarbonatite would be several hundred degrees above its liquidus.",

            "abstract": "We consider practicality of a verified account of Net Ecosystem Carbon Budget for forest ecosystems (FCA) that supposes reliable assessment of uncertainties, i.e. understanding “uncertainty of uncertainties”. The FCA is a fuzzy (underspecified) system, of which membership function is inherently stochastic. Thus, any individually used method of FCA is not able to estimate structural uncertainties and usually reported “within method” uncertainties are inevitably partial. Attempting at estimation of “full uncertainties” of the studied system we follow the requirements of applied systems analysis integrating the major methods of terrestrial ecosystems carbon account, assessing the uncertainties “within method” for intermediate and final indicators of FCA with their following mutual constrains. Landscape-ecosystem approach (LEA) 1) serves for strict systems designing the account, 2) contains all relevant spatially distributed empirical and semi-empirical data and models, and 3) is presented in form of an Integrated Land Information System (ILIS). By-pixel parametrization of forest cover is provided by utilizing multi-sensor remote sensing data (12 RS products used) within GEO-wiki platform and other relevant information based on special optimization algorithms. Major carbon fluxes within the LEA (NPP, HR, disturbances etc.) are estimated based on fusion of empirical data with process-based elements by sets of regionally distributed models. Uncertainties within LEA are assessed for each module and at each step of the account. “Within method” results and uncertainties (including LEA, process-based models, eddy covariance, and inverse modelling) are harmonized based on the Bayesian approach. The above methodology have been applied to carbon account of Russian forests for 2000-2010; uncertainties of the FCA for individual years were estimated in limits of 25%. We discussed strengths and weaknesses of the approach, system requirements to different methods of FCA, information and research needs, obtained and potential levels of uncertainties.",

Edge effects are spatial and temporal phenomena. The effects of forest fragmentation vary primarily as functions of edge penetration distance, spatial arrangements and time of persistence of forest edges. Across varying penetration distances in a forest edge, numerous changes occur including elevated tree mortality and canopy desiccation, changes in forest structure and species composition, alternation of hydrological and carbon cycles. We analyzed the effects of edge penetration distance and time of persistence of forest edges on forest biophysical characteristics based upon more than thirty 500m transects over highly fragmented forests in Acre, the southwestern Amazon. Spatial variability of tree data (diameter at breast height – DBH, above ground biomass, tree density, species composition and population) was measured along a penetration distance of 500m from forest edges. Different edge age classes (1-5yr, 6-10yr, > 10yr) and edge penetration distances were identified based upon a Landsat time-series analysis. The number of individual plants with DBH > 10cm tends to be greater near edge (largest in the first 100m), while larger biomass amounts are found at > 300m distance. The impact of penetration distance on biomass, however, is not statistically significant. In terms of the distribution of DBHs, while smaller trees with DBH <=20cm account for 70% of all trees, larger DBH trees tend to increase after 300m penetration distance. The effect of edge persistence period (edge age) is not significant for both the number of individual plants as well as the biomass, however it is more pronounced on secondary species’ biomass such as Cecrcopia sp and bamboo, which increase as edges persist longer.",

            "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate how high powered airborne electromagnetic resistivity is efficiently used to map 3D domains of unfrozen water below glaciers and permafrost in the cold regions of the Earth. Exploration in these parts of the world has typically been conducted using radar methods, either ground-based or from an airborne platform. Radar is an excellent method if the penetrated material has a low electrical conductivity, but in materials with higher conductivity, such as sediments with liquid water, the energy is attenuated . Such cases are efficiently explored with electromagnetic methods, which attenuate less quickly in conductive media and can therefore ‘see through’ conductors and return valuable information about their electrical properties.\nIn 2011, we used a helicopter-borne, time-domain electromagnetic sensor to map resistivity in the subsurface across the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV). The MDV are a polar desert in coastal Antarctica where glaciers, permafrost, ice-covered lakes, and ephemeral summer streams coexist. In polar environments, this airborne electromagnetic system excels at finding subsurface liquid water, as water which remains liquid under cold conditions must be sufficiently saline, and therefore electrically conductive. In Taylor Valley, in the MDV, our data show extensive subsurface low resistivity layers beneath higher resistivity layers, which we interpret as cryoconcentrated hypersaline brines lying beneath glaciers and frozen permafrost. These brines appear to be contiguous with surface lakes, subglacial regions, and the Ross Sea, which could indicate a regional hydrogeologic system wherein solutes may be transported between surface reservoirs by ionic diffusion and subsurface flow.\nThe system as of 2011 had a maximum exploration depth of about 300 m. However, newer and more powerful airborne systems can explore to a depth of 500 – 600 m and new ground based instruments will get to 1000 m. This is sufficient to penetrate to the base of almost all coastal Antarctic glaciers. The MDV, where conductive brines exist beneath resistive glacial ice and frozen permafrost, are especially well suited to exploration by airborne electromagnetic, but similarly suitable systems are likely to exist elsewhere in the cryosphere.",

            "abstract": "Coupled age and trace-element data from titanites in the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) of Norway suggest that continental crust underwent limited recrystallization and ductile flow through ~40 My of deep subduction and subsequent exhumation. Precambrian igneous titanites in granitic to tonalitic orthogneisses from the WGR were metastably preserved though Caledonian ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism and variably recrystallized through subsequent amphibolite-facies metamorphism from ~420–385 Ma. The inherited Precambrian titanites are not present everywhere but rather cluster primarily in a cooler “southern domain” (peak T ~650oC) and a hotter “northern domain” (peak T ~750-800oC).\nTitanite data were collected using LASS (laser-ablation split stream inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry) at UCSB, and a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define age and trace-element populations. These data indicate that inherited titanites are LREE-enriched, HFSE-enriched, and have higher Th/U, consistent with Precambrian neocrystallization from a granitic melt. In contrast, the recrystallized titanites have generally lower Th/U and flat, LREE-depleted, or hump-shaped trace-element patterns. These data suggest that (1) Caledonian titanite recrystallization occurred in the presence of LREE-depleted melts or fluids, or that (2) recrystallization was accompanied by a “typical” granitic melt, but that titanite/bulk-rock distribution coefficients are different for neo- and recrystallization; on-going whole-rock analyses will clarify these hypotheses. Critically, the geochemical signature of recrystallized titanite in felsic orthogneisses is comparable across the entire WGR – emphasizing that the petrologic process of titanite recrystallization was similar orogen-wide, but was less extensive in the domains where inherited titanite was preserved. In this case, large volumes of crust outside of the “old domains” may also have retained metastable titanite during subduction that was subsequently erased upon exhumation, compatible with limited ductile flow at ≥2 GPa and ≥650oC.",

            "abstract": "Deficiencies in geodetic products derived from the orbital trajectories of Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites determined by GPS-based Precise Orbit Determination (POD) were identified in recent years. The precise orbits of the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission are, e.g., severely affected by an increased position noise level over the geomagnetic poles and spurious signatures along the Earth's geomagnetic equator (see Fig. 1, which shows the carrier phase residuals of a reduced-dynamic orbit determination for GOCE in m). Such degradations may directly map into the gravity fields recovered from the orbits. They are related to a disturbed GPS signal propagation through the Earth's ionosphere and indicate that the GPS observation model and/or the data pre-processing need to be improved.\nWhile GOCE was the first mission where severe ionosphere-related problems became obvious, the GPS-based LEO POD of satellites of the more recent missions Swarm and Sentinel-1A turn out to be affected, as well. We characterize the stochastic and systematic behavior of the ionosphere by analyzing GPS data collected by the POD antennas of various LEO satellites covering a broad altitude range (e.g., GRACE, GOCE and Swarm) and for periods covering significant parts of an entire solar cycle, which probe substantially different ionosphere conditions.\nThe information may provide the basis for improvements of data pre-processing to cope with the ionosphere-induced problems of LEO POD. The performance of cycle slip detection can, e.g., be degraded by large changes of ionospheric refraction from one measurement epoch to the next. Geographically resolved information on the stochastic properties of the ionosphere above the LEOs provide more realistic threshold values for cycle slip detection algorithms.\nRemoving GPS data showing large ionospheric variations is a crude method to mitigate the ionosphere-induced artifacts in orbit and gravity field products. Using the geographically resolved characterization of the ionosphere, better data weighting schemes will be assessed in the GPS data processing for the POD of various LEO satellites. All results are established with the Bernese GNSS Software.",

            "abstract": "A combination of field, laboratory, and theoretical investigations has led to models for constructing upper crustal batholiths through pulsed emplacement of smaller magma batches. Whether melt accumulates or freezes at the emplacement level depends in part on the magma flux and the size of individual injections. Calibrating these variables in real systems has benefited greatly from the application of U-Pb zircon geochronology; however, as sampling density and number of analyses increases, it is commonly observed that zircon dates are continuous, not pulsed, on the pluton scale. Accurately interpreting such datasets to calibrate magmatic tempos thus requires an improved set of tools that link zircon crystallization histories to magmatic processes in dynamic systems. This contribution evaluates recent progress and challenges in using U-Pb geochronology to building models for magma transport and residence, as driven by the following questions: What are the timescales and sites of magmatic differentiation? What are the supersolidus temperature-time paths of magmas? What controls magma accumulation and eruptibility? Do zircon or other accessory minerals actually record these processes uniquely? To answer these questions, our recent work has emphasized integrating zircon geochronology and geochemistry with petrologic techniques, numerical modeling, and field mapping. Using this approach on arc systems from the pluton to batholith scale, we can now better characterize the pulsed nature of upper crustal magmatism and track the presence and crystallization history of melts. However, uncertainties persist in regard to our understanding of, e.g., zircon trace element partition coefficients, controls on magma zircon saturation, and how sampling bias at the handsample and regional scales affects our models of crustal magmatism. Addressing these unknowns will only further augment geochronology’s role in reconstructing the formation, evolution and emplacement of magmas.",

Additionally, an excess of P (P*) in OMZ-influenced waters is also supposed to provide a niche for nitrogen fixing organisms. In order to assess the influence of low inorganic nutrient ratios on the stoichiometry and composition of primary producers, biogeochemical measurements were carried out in the eastern tropical South Pacific during R/V Meteor cruise M93. A succession of different functional types of phytoplankton was observed along onshore – offshore transects with diatoms dominating the productive upwelling region, while haptophytes, cryptophytes and crysophytes prevailed in the more oligotrophic open ocean. Simultaneously, particulate organic nitrogen to phosphorus ratios increased with increasing distance from shore. The stoichiometry of organic matter, however, always exceeded ratios of 16:1, although nutrient supply ratios were below Redfield proportions in the whole sampling area. A considerable amount of P* was detected in the surface ocean layer above the shelf, which decreased as water masses were advected beyond the shelf slope. Phytoplankton pigment analyses with HPLC revealed the existence of diazotrophic marker pigments in the study area, hinting towards a local replenishment of the N-deficit via nitrogen fixation.",

The Permo-Triassic Lough Neagh Basin, situated in the southeastern part of Northern Ireland, exhibits elevated geothermal gradient (~30 °C/km) in the exploratory drilled boreholes. This is taken to indicate good geothermal exploitation potential in the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer for heating, and possibly even electricity production, purposes. We have used a 3-D joint inversion framework for modelling the magnetotelluric (MT) and gravity data collected to the north of the Lough Neagh to derive robust subsurface geological models. Comprehensive supporting geophysical and geological data (e.g. borehole logs and reflection seismic images) have been used in order to analyze and model the MT and gravity data. The geophysical data sets were provided by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI).\nConsidering correct objective function weighting in favor of noise-free MT response functions is particularly important in joint inversion. There is no simple way how to correct distortion effects the 3-D responses as can be done in 1-D or 2-D case. We have used the Tellus Project airborne EM data to constrain magnetotelluric data and correct them for near surface effects. The shallow models from airborne data are used to constrain the uppermost part of 3-D inversion model.\nPreliminary 3-D joint inversion modeling reveals that the Sherwood Sandstone Group and the Permian Sandstone Formation are imaged as a conductive zone at the depth range of 500 m to 2000 m with laterally varying thickness, depth, and conductance. The conductive target sediments become shallower and thinner to the north and they are laterally continuous.\nTo obtain better characterization of thermal transport properties of investigated area we used porosity and resistivity data from the Annaghmore and Ballymacilroy boreholes to estimate the relations between porosity/permeability and electrical conductivity. The formulae are based on generalized Archie's law for multiple phases.\nThe conductive layers are interpreted as water bearing or geothermal fluids and estimated porosity and permeability indicates potential to act as geothermal aquifer.",

Using the results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project v5 (CMIP5) abrupt4xco2 experiment, we explore regional differences in the timing, as opposed to magnitude, of the warming from emissions of CO2. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly high amount of regional diversity in the pace of realization of the warming effect of a CO2 emission, with relatively accelerated warming for areas such as the eastern United States and Central Asia and a relatively long lag between emission and warming effect for Australia and Amazonia. Figure 1 shows the ratio of the ensemble median rate of warming in the first decade after a change in CO2 concentration to the rate of warming for the remainder of the first century. Because estimates of social cost of carbon implicitly assume similar timing of warming for all regions, the observed effects have important implications for climate policy.",

            "abstract": "The structure of energy storing magnetic field lines on the Sun is very twisted and contorted. Some of the twist arises from photospheric foot point motion and some is due to currents carried into the corona as fields emerge. The stability of a region depends on both the energy stored (so-called “free” energy) and on the structure of the surrounding nearly potential fields. Free energy is usually contained in these S-shaped regions called sigmoids on the solar corona. The only way to reach lower energy state is to release this free energy, by changing its connectivity. This change in connectivity leads to flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that can affect environments of nearby planets. For this project, we focus on a special kind of connectivity change called slip-running reconnection to create 3D numerical models of flare-producing magnetic fields. By comparing these numerical models to observational data from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), we will be able to better explain the evolution of sigmoidal flares from active regions. We are studying a flare from Dudik et al 2014 paper (2012 July 12), and a flare from 2015 June 14. Using the Coronal Modeling System (CMS) software, we read the photospheric magnetogram for the specified date and time, compute the potential field, setup the 3D flux rope path, and then relax this flux rope over 60,000 iterations to create a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF). Using these relaxed models we find the best-fit loops surrounding the flux rope. We then compare these models to the observations in AIA. We compare the magnetic field structure in our models with the observed slipping. For regions near our inserted flux rope, our models successfully correlate with this observation. Further modeling is required, but these initial results suggest that NLFFF modeling may be able to capture realistic 3-D magnetic structures associated with slipping reconnection.",

            "abstract": "Gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is one of the main tools for the study of the isotopic compositions of light elements, extended in the last 10 years to the measurements of molecules bearing several rare isotopes (e.g., clumped isotopes of CO2) as well as position-specific isotopic substitutions in a few choice analytes (e.g., in N2O). Measuring those low-abundance species creates several technical challenges, with the main one being the presence of numerous isobaric interferences. Those can come either from contaminants (background gases present in the source of the instrument or impurities introduced with the analyte), or unwanted beams created by the analyte itself during the ionization process (for example adducts and fragments).\nIn order to avoid those isobaric species, new high-resolution, double-focusing IRMS have been developed. We present here the capabilities of the production series version of the ThermoFisher Scientific 253 Ultra, which was installed at SUERC in July 2015. The instrument is capable of reaching high mass resolving power (above 40,000) and is similar in design to the Caltech 253 Ultra prototype. The collector array has 9 detector positions, 8 of which are movable. Faraday cups at each detector can be linked to amplifiers with gains ranging from 3.108 to 1012 Ohm (and 1013 Ohm amplifiers being currently developped). There are also 4 ion counters, one of which located behind a retardation lens (RPQ) to limit background noise and improve abundance sensitivity.\nAdditionally, one of the Faraday cup in the new instrument has a very narrow entrance slit, allowing high mass resolving power and high resolution, with a complete separation of the ion beams instead of complex peak shapes corresponding to overlapping ion beams. This will potentially remove the need for adduct lines or peak stripping schemes for analytes like CH4.",

In the research, we give full play to the characteristics of seismic, gravity and magnetic data, complementing each other's advantages. 3D tectonic framework of the East China Sea shelf is inverted by the three data, and then we can slove problems such as the distribution of faults, the regional stratigraphy and the basement structure, etc.\nUsing the 2D seismic interpretation results, the initial geological geophysical model for interface inversion is established, and the seismic section can determine the shape of the shallow density interface accurately. The weights are modified to different values on deep and shallow density interface layers during the joint inversion. The multi solution of gravity and density interface inversion is greatly reduced with the constraint of seismic data. On the basis of the joint inversion, the refined 2.5 dimensional gravity, magnetic and seismic interpretation of seismic section has been done, abundant geological section maps and the 3D structural features of the study area has been obtained. In the seismic section, the faults can be well identified. Thus, the seismic breakpoints are projected to the gravity and magnetic anomaly map, the faults are combined along the anomalies gradient zone and other gravity-magnetic anomaly maps. Finally, different levels grades and stages of the fracture are obtained, and the fracture of the study area is fully recognized. The identification method of igneous rock is similar to the fault.\nA series of new knowledge has been obtained. The three interfaces include the bottom of Pliocene series, Miocene series and sedimentary base by inversion. The dividing line between north and south block of haijiao salient should be shorter in the west and east direction, and the salient area is larger than previously known; The basement of yushan salient in the south can be composed of Mesozoic igneous rocks; The formations of xihu sag were completely developed, the thickness and the subsidence amplitude of Cenozoic sedimentary is big, and the basement base is about 11794 meters.

During summer, the observatory is frequently within the Saharan Air Layer and thus often exposed to dust. Absolute INP concentrations and activated fractions at T=-40 to -15°C and RHi=100-150 % were measured.\nIn this study, we discuss the in-situ measured INP properties with respect to changes in the chemical composition, the biological content, the source regions as well as transport pathways and thus aging processes of the dust aerosol. For the first time, ice crystal residues were also analyzed with regard to biological content by means of their autofluorescence signal close to a major dust source region. Airborne dust samples were collected with a cyclone for additional offline analysis in the laboratory under similar conditions as in the field. Both, in-situ and offline dust samples were chemically characterized using single-particle mass spectrometry. The DREAM8 dust model extended with dust mineral fractions was run to simulate meteorological and dust aerosol conditions for ice nucleation.\nResults show that the background aerosol at Izaña was dominated by carbonaceous particles, which were hardly ice-active under the investigated conditions. When Saharan dust was present, INP concentrations increased by up to two orders of magnitude even at water subsaturated conditions at T≤-25°C. Differences in the ice-activated fraction were found between different dust periods which seem to be linked to variations in the aerosol chemical composition (dust mixed with changing fractions of sea salt and differences in the dust aerosol itself). Furthermore, two biomass burning events in 2014 were identified which led to very low INP concentrations under the investigated temperature and relative humidity conditions.",

            "abstract": "Sub-ice-shelf melting(freezing) of the Antarctic ice shelves acts as a source(sink) of freshwater, therefore, affects ocean water properties and circulation. In its turn, sub-ice-shelf melting/freezing is controlled by the ocean water properties that reach the sub-ice-shelf cavities. The properties of these water masses are determined by heat and fresh-water exchange with sea ice and atmosphere. Simulations of a high-resolution (1/8 deg) global sea-ice-ocean isopycnal model capable to resolve the ocean circulation in sub-ice-shelf cavities of Antarctic ice shelves and account for the thermodynamic interaction of the circulation with ice shelves show that melting/freezing rates have a strong seasonal cycle with highest melting rates observed in the Austral Fall. On the continental shelf, subsurface ocean temperatures (100-300 m) have a similar seasonal cycle which is lagged with respect to the surface. Shelf temperatures peak in the summertime, followed by rapid cooling towards the freezing point as seasonal ice cover increases. The lagged warming in the subsurface is attributable to reduced heat loss to the atmosphere in the presence of seasonal sea ice. This suggests that the seasonal cycle in melt rates is controlled by the phasing of subsurface temperatures on the continental shelf, which is in turn dominated by sea ice. The outflowing fresh, cold and light meltwater formed in sub-ice-shelf cavities remains in the mixed layer and promotes formation of sea ice and its longer persistence into the Austral Summer. These processes suggest the presence of strong mutual feedbacks between sub-ice-shelf melting and sea ice formation around Antarctic ice shelves.",

To sidestep a complex (and uncertain) aerosol treatment (emission to mass to optics) a monthly gridded climatology for aerosol properties has been developed. This MPI Aerosol Climatology (MAC) is strongly tied to observational statistics for aerosol column optical properties by AERONET (over land) and by MAN (over oceans). To fill spatial gaps, to address decadal change and to address vertical variability, these sparsely distributed local data are extended with central data of an ensemble of output from global models with complex aerosol modules. This data merging in performed for aerosol column amount (AOD), for aerosol size (AOD,fine) and for aerosol absorption (AAOD). The resulting MAC aerosol climatology is an example for the combination of high quality local observations with spatial, temporal and vertical context from model simulations.",

This wide range in geochemical contexts results in diverse microbial communities that may have varying abilities to access organic matter. We can address these functional differences by comparing enzyme activities initializing the breakdown of organic matter across these sediment types; however, previous direct measurements of the extracellular hydrolysis of complex organic carbon in sediments are sparse. We measured this first step of heterotrophic processing of organic matter in sediments at 5-10cm and 55-60cm depth from a wide range of environmental settings in Guaymas Basin. Sediment sources included sulfidic seeps on the Sonora Margin, hemipelagic ridge flank sediments, and hydrothermically altered Sonora Margin sediments bordering a methane seep site. Hydrolysis of organic substrates varied by depth and by sediment source, but despite high energy potential and organic carbon load in sulfidic sediments, activity was not highest where hydrothermal influence was highest. These results suggest that heterotrophic breakdown of organic carbon in Guaymas Basin sediments may be sensitive to factors including varying composition of organic carbon available in different sediment types, or differences in microbial community capacities to access specific organic substrates.",

            "abstract": "Empirically-based rate-and-state friction laws (RSFL) have been proposed to model the dependence of friction forces with slip and time. The relevance of the RSFL for earthquakes mechanics is that few constitutive parameters (e.g. A-B= dτ/dlog(V) with τ and V the shear stress and slip rate respectively, allow us to define the stability conditions of a fault. According to RSFL if A-B> 0, τ increases with V (rate-hardening behavior) resulting in an unconditionally stable behavior; if A-B< 0, τ decreases with V (rate-weakening behavior) potentially resulting in an unstable behavior leading to dynamic runaway. Given that τ at steady state conditions allows us also to define a critical fault stiffness, the RSFL determine a condition of stability for faults as their stiffness approaches the critical conditions. However, the conditions of fault stability, determined by the critical stiffness under the assumption of either a rate-weakening or a rate-hardening behavior, might be restrictive given that frictional properties sensibly change as a function of slip or slip rate. Moreover, the RSFL were determined from experiments conducted at sub-seismic slip rates (< 1 cm/s) and their extrapolation to earthquake deformation conditions remains questionable on the basis of the experimental evidence of large dynamic weakening at seismic slip rates and the plethora of slip events which characterize the seismic cycle. Here, we propose a modified RSFL based on the review of a large published and unpublished dataset of rock-friction experiments performed with different testing machines (rotary shear, bi-axial, tri-axial). The modified RSFL is valid at steady-state conditions from sub-seismic to seismic slip rates (0.1 µm/s <V< 3 m/s). This law describes fault frictional stability and the diversity of slip events observed at the laboratory scale. This law leads to a new definition of critical stiffness with relevance to models of seismic rupture nucleation, propagation and arrest.",

The main mission goals are the determination of the sea surface height and surface winds. Secondary goals are monitoring of land surface parameters and atmosphere sounding using GNSS radio occultation measurements.\nThe international scientific study GARCA (GNSS-Reflectometry Assessment of Requirements and Consolidation of Retrieval Algorithms), funded by ESA, is part of the preparations for GEROS-ISS. Major goals of GARCA are the development of an end2end Simulator for the GEROS-ISS measurements (GEROS-SIM) and the evaluation of the error budget of the GNSS reflectometry measurements.\nIn this presentation we introduce some of the GARCA activities to quantify the influence of the ionized and neutral atmosphere on the altimetric measurements, which is a major error source for GEROS-ISS. At first, we analyse, to which extend the standard linear combination of interferometric paths at different carrier frequencies can be used to correct for the ionospheric propagation effects. Second, we make use of the tangent-linear version of our ray-trace algorithm to propagate the uncertainty of the underlying refractivity profile into the uncertainty of the interferometric path. For comparison the sensitivity of the interferometric path with respect to the sea surface height is computed. Though our calculations are based on a number of simplifying assumptions (the Earth is a sphere, the atmosphere is spherically layered and the ISS and GNSS satellite orbits are circular) some general conclusions can be drawn. In essence, for elevation angles above -5° at the ISS the higher-order ionospheric errors and the uncertaintiy of the inteferometric path due to the uncertainty of the underlying refractivity profile are small enough to distinguish a sea surface height of ± 0.5 m.",

            "abstract": "The observation that managed ecosystems often fail to respond smoothly to changing external pressures has shed some light on their complex non-linear dynamics. The concept of critical transitions (i.e., ecosystem regime shifts), thresholds and alternative stable states has since spread to the ecological and environmental management literature. Most recently, however, reviews have raised some skepticism about whether these catastrophic transitions are the exceptions rather than the rule. Overall, a better understanding of the occurrence and processes of such critical transitions requires more empirical testing and evidence on the mechanistic links between pressures and consequent ecological change. Many of the changes observed, or modeled, by ecologists extend beyond the monitoring record. Palaeo-ecological records thus represent a unique opportunity to extend our temporal perspective to the relevancy of critical transitions. Yet, paleo-ecological records have their own biases and shortcomings, such as sediment focusing, irregular temporal integration and often studied in a semi-quantitative way. As such, palaeo-ecological time series are not strictly analogous to instrumental datasets. In this work, we aimed to test, using both modeled and actual records, how different properties that are common in palaeo-ecological records affect our ability to detect past non-linear dynamics, such as early-warning signals of catastrophic shifts.",

            "abstract": "Continental flood basalts (CFB) are extreme manifestations of mantle melting derived from chemically/isotopically heterogeneous mantle. Much of this heterogeneity comes from lithospheric material recycled into the convecting mantle by a range of mechanisms (e.g. subduction, delamination). The abundance and petrogenetic origins of these lithologies thus provide important constraints on the geodynamical origins of CFB magmatism, and the timescales of lithospheric recycling in the mantle. Basalt geochemistry has long been used to constrain the compositions and mean ages of recycled lithologies in the mantle. Typically, this work assumes the isotopic compositions of the basalts are the same as their mantle source(s). However, because basalts are mixtures of melts derived from different sources (having different fusibilities) generated over ranges of P and T, their isotopic compositions only indirectly represent the isotopic compositions of their mantle sources[1]. Thus, relating basalts compositions to mantle source compositions requires information about the melting process itself. To investigate the nature of lithologic source heterogeneity while accounting for the effects of melting during CFB magmatism, we utilize the REEBOX PRO forward melting model[2], which simulates adiabatic decompression melting in lithologically heterogeneous mantle. We apply the model to constrain the origins and abundance of mantle heterogeneity associated with Paleogene flood basalts erupted during the rift-to-drift transition of Pangea breakup along the Central East Greenland rifted margin of the North Atlantic igneous province. We show that these basalts were derived by melting of a hot, lithologically heterogeneous source containing depleted, subduction-modified lithospheric mantle, and <10% recycled oceanic crust. The Paleozoic mean age we calculate for this recycled crust is consistent with an origin in the region's prior subduction history, and with estimates for the mean age of recycled crust in the modern Iceland plume[3]. These results suggest that this lithospheric material was not recycled into the lower mantle before becoming entrained in the Iceland plume.\n[1] Rudge et al. (2013).

            "abstract": "Water utilities across the United States face growing supply risks as demand growth and extreme weather events make water scarcity more common. As it has become more difficult and expensive to build new supply capacity to accommodate these events, many utility managers respond by either imposing conservation measures, which reduces revenues, or acquiring additional water from other sources, which increases costs. These actions lead to changing financial trends that are difficult to predict and that utilities are currently ill-equipped to manage. As a result, adaptation strategies and tools are being developed to reduce utility vulnerabilities, ensuring both financial stability and continued access to low cost financing, a critical consideration for a capital intensive industry. Previous work in this area has involved the development of utility specific financial hedging tools. However, the time and informational requirements associated with developing these individualized strategies may be a limiting factor for widespread implementation. The objective of this research is to develop more generalized hedging instruments that can be applied simultaneously to multiple utilities across the United States, thereby increasing the potential for widespread implementation. This work first analyzes the financial risks of water scarcity for a large set of water utilities across the country and then proposes a financial hedging solution to mitigate these risks through hydrologic index-based financial insurance. Results provide insights into the most effective indices, the potential for risk pooling to reduce insurance costs, and the performance of these contracts in managing utility financial risk arising from drought.",

            "abstract": "Though greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) from mineral fertilizer application in agriculture have been well studied, the effect of organic amendment (OA) application rate on GHGEs is not yet understood. Application of multiple OAs can improve different properties that control soil fertility, including nutrient availability, aggregate stability, and water-holding capacity. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) flux at an organic farm in Goleta, CA in order to understand how OA application rate affects GHGEs and crop yield from agricultural soils. Based on management practices in the region, we asked farm managers to establish high compost (HC) and low compost (LC) treatments during the growing season of an annual crop (18.2, 9.13 Mg ha-1, respectively), and we measured GHGEs in beds and furrows using static chambers. Organic fertilizer (672 kg ha-1) was applied equally to HC and LC beds six weeks after compost application. Overall, emissions of N2O and CO2 were higher in HC than LC, but yield-scaled emissions were higher in LC. Importantly, treatment differences in both N2O and CO2 emissions were not apparent until after mid-season fertilizer application. Net CH4 uptake was higher in HC than LC in the furrows, but there was no difference in the beds. Our data suggest that high compost application rates likely increased SOM mineralization, soil water content, and nitrification and denitrification rates in HC relative to LC, which led to higher N2O emissions during the growing season. Fertilization primed SOM decomposition and increased soil respiration, which led to increased CO2 emissions. Our results suggest that improved management of application rate and timing during use of multiple OAs could reduce GHGEs while maintaining high crop yield. Understanding the mechanisms by which OA application rates alter the balance between GHGEs and yield is an important step toward reducing agriculture’s contribution to climate change through policy.",

The focus was on assessing the impact of (i) NAPL saturation, (ii) interfacial area (iii) NAPL spatial distribution at the pore scale, (iv) grain size heterogeneity and (v) REV or domain size on the apparent interphase mass transfer. Variability of both the mass transfer coefficient that explicitly accounts for the interfacial area and the mass transfer coefficient that lumps the interfacial area was examined. It was shown that pore scale NAPL distribution and its orientation relative to the flow direction have significant impact on flow bypassing and the interphase mass transfer coefficient. This results in a complex non-linear relationship between interfacial area and the REV-based interphase mass transfer rate. In other words, explicitly accounting for the interfacial area does not eliminate the variability of the mass transfer coefficient. Moreover, grain size heterogeneity can also lead to a decrease in the interphase mass transfer. It was also shown that, even for explicitly defined flow patterns, changing the domain size over which the mass transfer process is average influences the extent of NAPL bypassing and dilution and, consequently, the interphase mass transfer.",

            "abstract": "While tree ring and lake sediment core studies have revealed a great deal about North Pacific (e.g. Alaska) surface temperature variability over the past millennium, we do not have an equivalent understanding of North Pacific hydroclimate variability or temperatures at high elevations. A millennial-length precipitation proxy record is needed to place late 20th century Alaskan precipitation increases into longer context, and to evaluate hydroclimate changes during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly. High-elevation summer temperature records would be valuable for understanding the sensitivity of Alaskan glaciers to past warm and cool periods. Here we present an overview of the new Denali Ice Core record collected from the summit plateau (4000 m a.s.l.) of Mt. Hunter (63° N, 151° W) in Denali National Park, Alaska. Two parallel ice cores were collected to bedrock (208 m in length) in May-June 2013, sampled using the Dartmouth continuous melter system, and analyzed for major ions, trace elements, particle concentration and size distribution, and stable isotope ratios at Dartmouth and the Universities of Maine and New Hampshire. The cores are dated using robust annual oscillations in dust elements, methanesulfonate, ammonium, and stable isotopes, and validated using major volcanic eruptions recorded as sulfate, chloride and heavy metal spikes, and the 1963 nuclear weapons testing 137Cs spike. Preliminary analyses indicate a significant increase in both summer temperature and annual accumulation over the 20th century, and significant relationships with major ocean-atmospheric modes including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We compare the new Denali record to the Eclipse Icefield and Mt. Logan ice core records and develop composite records of North Pacific hydroclimate and atmospheric circulation variability over the past millennium.",

Pollen’s radiative impact is also not quantified because it is neglected in climate modeling studies. Here we couple an online, meteorological active pollen emissions model guided by observations of airborne pollen to understand the role of pollen in the atmosphere. We use existing pollen counts from 2003-2008 across the continental U.S. in conjunction with a tree database and historical meteorological data to create an observation-based phenological model that produces accurately scaled and timed emissions. These emissions are emitted and transported within the regional climate model (RegCM4) and the direct radiative effect is calculated. Additionally, we simulate the rupture of coarse pollen grains into finer particles by adding a second size mode for pollen emissions, which contributes to the shortwave radiative forcing and also has an indirect effect on climate.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation is the main driving force for the terrestrial water cycle and therefore plays a critical role in determining the water budget at catchment scale. Traditionally, rain gauges are used to measure precipitation on the ground surface for hydrological modeling. However, the number of rain gauges in Denmark has significantly decreased in recent years, and it is no longer possible to represent the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall only by interpolating the rain gauge data given the current gauge density in Skjern catchment, Denmark. The quality of simulated hydrological patterns using such rain gauge based products is visibly decreased. Weather radar scans the atmosphere with large areal coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution, which makes it an ideal tool to overcome this problem. The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) operates C-band radars over the country. It has been previously attempted to use the single-polarization radar located at Rømø to estimate precipitation in Skjern catchment; however, the hydrological improvement by adding the single-polarization radar data was marginal due to many restrictions. A new radar located at Virring with upgraded dual-polarization technology opens new possibilities to further improve the precipitation estimation at Skjern catchment. New parameters retrieved from the Virring radar will be used to develop more advanced quantitative precipitation estimation algorithms which is an important supplement to the existing algorithm called ARNE. The development of the new algorithm will be based on the Open Source Library for Weather Radar Data Processing (WRadLib). The results of hydrological models using such product are expected to better close the water budget and improve the simulated hydrological pattern such as the land surface temperature.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are typically followed by months of afterslip, the total of which is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the seismic slip. The classic model for afterslip envisions seismic slip transferring stress to adjacent regions, driving accelerated stable sliding that expands the rupture area. However, a small proportion of earthquakes exhibit unusually large and rapid afterslip in the hours immediately following rupture. Here we present a new model that bridges the transition from seismic to postseismic deformation and may explain these observations of rapid afterslip. Seismic slip produces a significant temperature rise that slowly diffuses into the surrounding material following the cessation of seismic slip. Any process with strong temperature dependence is more sensitive to this heat transient than to the ambient temperatures present during the interseismic period. Coupling the temperature evolution of a fault to a ductile flow law we model postseismic deformation during the heat transient. Our idea of coseismic heating enhancing ductile flow is supported by field observations of micro-shear zones adjacent to psuedotachylyte veins. Enhanced ductility is largely confined to the zone that deformed seismically, making our model equivalent to rapid afterslip. Combining analytic and numerical methods we solve for the total afterslip in terms of the slip rate and fault strength during seismic slip and the ductile flow parameters. Our results are sensitive to the assumed rheology and deforming zone thickness, and while total afterslip is generally small some plausible parameter ranges predict afterslip comparable to or greater than the seismic slip developing over timescales shorter than an hour. We demonstrate that rapid afterslip can drive significant frictional heating, leading to a thermal runaway instability that produces a near total postseismic stress drop. To conclude we investigate the tsunami magnitude that rapid afterslip could produce.",

            "abstract": "The dense coverage of the EarthScope USArray presents an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate the structure of the continental crust across different tectonic regimes. Receiver function analysis of body wave arrivals can isolate converted phases (Ps or Sp) produced across velocity discontinuities beneath a seismometer and constrain relative vertical density and seismic velocity variations. Analysis of receiver functions computed for stations across the footprint of the USArray can be used to constrain both the strength and topography of crustal interfaces. However, complications in receiver function analysis arise from trade-offs among compressional (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocity variations, as well as reverberations caused by sediment-dominated regions within the United States.\nWe show that by measuring the apparent incidence angle of P waves – their relative amplitude on the vertical and radial components of the seismogram – computed for different time-windows, we can obtain an estimate of crustal Vs layering at each station. The calculated Vs estimate is in terms of absolute as opposed to relative velocity variations and is independent of Vp. Using synthetic waveforms, we quantify to what extent absolute velocity inferences obtained using the apparent-incidence angle method are affected by multiple reverberations in shallow layers. We then use both synthetics and data to evaluate the potential of the apparent incidence method for constraining anisotropy, and compare it to receiver functions. Finally, we compare and contrast results from receiver function and apparent incidence angle analyses in different tectonic settings across North America.",

We show that this method is useful for rapid and inexpensive recording of fault displacement. The SfM technique represents a significant advance over traditional post-earthquake field measurements, which are irreproducible because displacement may change over time due to afterslip, and because the detailed features of a surface rupture quickly degrade either due to weathering or repair. Using SfM, we documented ten sites with tectonic slip along the surface rupture of the South Napa earthquake. Using repeat surveys, we documented two sites with appreciable afterslip over the days, weeks, and months after the earthquake. We illustrate a simple workflow that allows other workers to conduct surveys with enough reference information to easily scale and orient fine scale features of surface rupture captured with SfM.",

            "abstract": "At the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, the working group Earthquakes and Volcano Physics examines the spatiotemporal behavior of earthquakes. In this context also the hazards of volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are explored. The aim is to collect related information after the occurrence of such extreme event and make them available for science and partly to the public as quickly as possible. However, the overall objective of this research is to reduce the geological risks that emanate from such natural hazards. In order to meet the stated objectives and to get a quick overview about the seismicity of a particular region and to compare the situation to historical events, a comprehensive visualization was desired.\nBased on the web-accessible data from the famous GFZ GEOFON network a user-friendly web mapping application was realized. Further, this web service integrates historical and current earthquake information from the USGS earthquake database, and more historical events from various other catalogues like Pacheco, International Seismological Centre (ISC) and more. This compilation of sources is unique in Earth sciences. Additionally, information about historical and current occurrences of volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are also retrievable. Another special feature in the application is the containment of times via a time shifting tool. Users can interactively vary the visualization by moving the time slider. Furthermore, the application was realized by using the newest JavaScript libraries which enables the application to run in all sizes of displays and devices. Our contribution will present the making of, the architecture behind, and few examples of the look and feel of this application.",

For the first iteration, we man- age to make 460,539 frequency-dependent phase measurements by comparing synthetic and observed seismograms. Crustal model EPcrust2.0 combined with mantle model S362ANI comprise the initial 3D model US00. Before the iterative structure inversion, earthquake source parameters (i.e., centroid moment tensor and location), are re-inverted using 3D Green’s functions and Frch ́et derivatives. Radially anisotropic (frequency-dependent) sen- sitivity kernels are employed in the structure inversion to image anisotropic features within the upper mantle. Higher frequency signals are gradually incorporated in the inversion in order to resolve small scale heterogeneities. Statistical assessments of traveltime anoma- lies and waveform differences enable us to validate the inverted sources and structural parameters. Our current model, US22, shows numerous interesting features for the North American continent, for instance, significant contrast between eastern and western Amer- ica, slab features beneath the Cascadian subduction zone and Caribbean, slow anomalies related to the Asthenosphere beneath the North Atlantic ocean, etc. ",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen sources in the Mississippi River basin have been linked to degradation of stream ecology and to Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. In 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency characterized water-quality stressors and ecological conditions in 100 wadeable streams across the Midwestern United States. Relatively wet conditions (2013) followed a severe drought (2012); this dry-wet pattern has been shown to be associated with elevated nitrogen concentrations and loads in streams. Nitrate concentrations during the May to August 2013 sampling period ranged from <0.04 mg L-1 to 41.8 mg L-1 as N, with a mean of 5.31 mg L-1. The highest concentrations were in Iowa and Minnesota (means of 14.4 and 10.2 mg L-1, respectively). Nitrate concentration departure from normal was positively correlated to the 2013–2012 antecedent precipitation index, a measure of the departure from normal precipitation. Correlations to watershed characteristics and nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate indicate that inorganic fertilizer and manure use in crop production, principally corn, were the dominant sources of nitrate. The anomalously high nitrate levels in parts of the Midwest in 2013 coincided with reported higher-than-normal nitrate loads in the Mississippi River. Because forecasts of future climate indicate that more frequent floods and droughts are likely in the Midwest, nitrate anomalies such as those measured in response to the dry-wet pattern in 2012 and 2013 could become more frequent.",

Mass fragments detected from the mudstones are consistent with C1-C4 alkyl and single-ring aromatic components that evolve at different temperatures and often in multiple phases. Concurrent release of oxidized sulfur (sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide), sulfide gases (hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, dimethylsulfide or thiol, and thiophene) suggest that either these gases are evolving directly from the mudstone or are products of gas phase reactions in the SAM oven, or both. Multiple chlorohydrocarbon releases are also observed in analysis of the Mojave mudstone indicating punctuated organic releases from the sample. The organic signatures observed are unique to specific samples and are not observed in blanks or all samples, nor can the SAM background explain them. These results suggest that geologically refractory organic matter has been preserved in some Hesperian mudstones despite possible acid-sulfate weathering (as suggested by jarosite in Mojave) and exposure to ionizing cosmic rays after exhumation. We will report on ongoing study of these samples.",

Despite the small seasonal variation expected for tropical rainforests, converging evidence has shown that, among other factors, there can be considerable differences between the wet and dry seasons in leaf coverage, species composition, leaf-level photosynthetic photo flux, and ozone and NOx levels, which are important controlling factors of VOC emission and chemistry. There have been, however, a limited number of studies on the seasonality of VOC concentrations over tropical rainforests. As part of the GoAmazon 2014/5 Experiment, two-month continuous measurements of VOC compounds were carried out using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) at the T3 site in both the wet and dry seasons of 2014. During the dry season most biogenic VOC species and their oxidation products exhibited increased concentration. For some species, the diel pattern was also different between the two seasons. Implications of the seasonality of the emission and chemistry of biogenic VOCs, in particular isoprene and terpenes, are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Turbidity currents are, volumetrically, the most important process for the transportation of sediment on the face of our planet. The combination of large volume and fast speeds can damage globally important seafloor cables and offshore structures and may transport sediment over hundreds of kilometres. Despite their significance for sediment flux and as geohazards, very few examples of direct monitoring of real-world turbidity currents exist. Until recently, there has been a reliance on depositional records, scaled-down experiments and numerical models to understand the nature of turbidity currents. The results of direct monitoring obtained over the past few years now provide us with ground-breaking insights into the real-world behaviour of full-scale turbidity currents. We present results of recent flow monitoring acquired using an array of acoustic and geophysical tools, from multiple sites worldwide, including the deep-sea Congo Canyon, Canadian fjords, and a dredging experiment offshore Holland.\nThis advent in turbidity current monitoring, largely driven by step-changes in technology, has reinforced some existing interpretations, but also challenges some preconceptions. Our results are based on monitoring using multibeam sonars, sub-bottom and acoustic Doppler current profilers. First, we provide insights into the triggering of flows that include landslides, tidal and wave effects, and other more cryptic events with no clear initiation point. Second, the influence of dense layers at the base of flows is shown to be important for sediment transport and bedform migration; however, most acoustic techniques struggle to penetrate. Initial results from a novel Chirp profiler provide imaging of the lowermost part of the flow. Third, the morphology of the flow and its development through time are shown to deviate from that observed in classical flume tank experiments. Finally, we summarise some future directions for flow monitoring to push forward our understanding of these dynamic flows.",

            "abstract": "Globally distributed atmospheric CO2 measurements with high precision, low bias and full seasonal sampling are crucial to advance carbon cycle sciences. However, two thirds of the Earth’s surface is typically covered by clouds, and passive remote sensing approaches from space, e.g., OCO-2 and GOSAT, are limited to cloud-free scenes. They are unable to provide useful retrievals in cloudy areas where the photon path-length can’t be well characterized. Thus, passive approaches have limited global coverage and poor sampling in cloudy regions, even though some cloudy regions have active carbon surface fluxes.\nNASA Goddard is developing a pulsed integrated-path, differential absorption (IPDA) lidar approach to measure atmospheric column CO2 concentrations from space as a candidate for NASA’s ASCENDS mission. Measurements of time-resolved laser backscatter profiles from the atmosphere also allow this technique to estimate column CO2 and range to cloud tops in addition to those to the ground with precise knowledge of the photon path-length. This allows retrievals of column CO2 concentrations to cloud tops, providing much higher spatial coverage and some information about vertical structure of CO2. This is expected to benefit atmospheric transport process studies, carbon data assimilation in models, and global and regional carbon flux estimation.\nWe show some preliminary results of the all-sky retrieval capability using airborne lidar measurements from the 2011, 2013 and 2014 ASCENDS airborne campaigns on the NASA DC-8. These show retrievals of atmospheric CO2 over low-level marine stratus clouds, cumulus clouds at the top of planetary boundary layer, some mid-level clouds and visually thin high-level cirrus clouds. The CO2 retrievals from the lidar are validated against in-situ measurements and compared to Goddard PCTM model simulations. Lidar cloud slicing to derive CO2 abundance in the planetary boundary layer and free troposphere also has been demonstrated. The capability of future lidar missions to measure CO2 above clouds will be particularly valuable for the regions with persistent cloud covers, e.g, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the west coasts of continents with marine layer clouds and the Southern Ocean, which has the highest occurrence of low-level clouds.",

            "abstract": "Rapid dynamic changes at the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, synchronous with ocean warming, have raised concern that tidewater glaciers can respond rapidly and sensitively to ocean forcing. One way in which ocean forcing would manifest is through the melting of the submerged parts of tidewater glacier calving fronts, with the spatial distribution of submarine melt a control on their morphology. Calving front morphology has thus far received little attention and yet has the potential to significantly impact calving rates and therefore tidewater glacier dynamics.\nHere we present a model which allows us to study the evolution of calving front morphology in two dimensions. We outline a new routine for calculating submarine melt rates from ocean models at calving fronts of arbitrary geometry, and for adjusting this geometry according to the calculated melt rates. This routine is applied to a high resolution (~1m) non-hydrostatic ocean model (MITgcm) with a glacier boundary (calving front) which evolves in time according to the simulated submarine melt rates.\nThe model shows, consistent with recent observations, that submarine melting leads to undercutting of tidewater glacier calving fronts. We examine how undercut magnitude, undercut depth and potential steady states respond to variation in subglacial discharge, ice velocity, and fjord depth, temperature and stratification. In addition to this analysis we use a diagnostic full-Stokes flow-line ice model to examine how these geometries affect ice internal stress and potential for calving. In undertaking this work we aim to elucidate a process which - supposing tidewater glaciers are sensitive to ocean forcing - must provide a fundamental link between the ocean and the ice.",

            "abstract": "Cities in the western U.S. are under increasing pressure to reduce the demand of imported water through increasing conservation efforts, altering non-native landscapes, and enhancing local water supplies. The State of California adopted emergency regulations implementing a mandatory 25% statewide reduction in potable urban water use and agricultural restrictions have also been enacted. The complexities in urban water flows and lack of granular data make understanding the impact of conservation and demand change on regional ecohydrology difficult. This presentation highlights ongoing work to better understand the coupling between humans, water and ecosystems in semi-arid urban cities, using metropolitan southern California as a case study. We evaluate historical and contemporary ecohydrologic behavior and human impacts through intensive data collection, remote sensing and high resolution modeling. The change in outdoor irrigation rates due to recent conservation measures (2008-2010) has resulted in overall decreased greenness and reduced dry season streamflow; however significant variability in conservation response is observed. Groundwater recharge, artificially supported by landscape irrigation, is also being impacted. In general, anthropogenic water fluxes (irrigation, pipe leakage, spreading grounds) are not parameterized in hydrologic and land surface models applied over urban areas. Inclusion of landscape irrigation significantly improves neighborhood scale simulations of evaporative fluxes and land surface temperatures and results in shifts in the energy partitioning. The cooling effects of irrigation on daily air temperatures has the largest influence over low intensity residential areas, with an average 2°C decrease observed in coupled model simulations (WRF-Noah-UCM). Ultimately, we strive to improve predictions of human-water interactions in semi-arid cities to better understand the effectiveness and impacts of ongoing drought and conservation efforts and guide demand strategies under future climate variability.",

The Choptank River, a Bay tributary on the Delmarva Peninsula, is dominated by intensive corn and soybean farming associated with poultry and some dairy production. The Choptank River is under Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) total maximum daily load restrictions. However, reducing nonpoint source pollution contributions from agriculture requires that source predictions be improved and that mitigation and conservation measures be properly targeted. Therefore, new measurement strategies have been implemented. In-situ sensors have been deployed adjacent to US Geological Survey gauging stations in the Tuckahoe and Greensboro sub-basins of the Choptank River watershed. These sensors measure stream water concentrations of nitrate along and water quality parameters every 30 min. Initial results indicate that ~40% less nitrate is exported from the Greensboro sub-basin, even though the total amount of agricultural land use is similar to that in the Tuckahoe sub-basin. This is most likely due to more efficient nitrate processing in the Greensboro sub-basin where the amount of cropland on poorly-drained soils is much larger. Another potential nitrogen source to the Choptank River estuary is atmospheric deposition of ammonia. Over 550 million broilers are produced yearly on the Delmarva Peninsula potentially leading to the release of 20,000 Mtons of ammonia. USEPA recently estimated that as much as 22% of nitrogen in the Bay is due to ammonia deposition. We have initiated a collaborative effort within the LTAR network to increase coverage of ammonia sampling and to explore the spatial and temporal variability of ammonia, particularly in the Choptank River watershed. All these measurements will be useful in improving the handling of nitrogen sources and its fate and transport in the Chesapeake Bay model.",

            "abstract": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and Directorate for Computer and Information Science (CISE) acknowledge the significant scientific challenges required to understand the fundamental processes of the Earth system, within the atmospheric and geospace, Earth, ocean and polar sciences, and across those boundaries. A broad view of the opportunities and directions for GEO are described in the report \"Dynamic Earth: GEO imperative and Frontiers 2015-2020.\" Many of the aspects of geosciences research, highlighted both in this document and other community grand challenges, pose novel problems for researchers in intelligent systems. Geosciences research will require solutions for data-intensive science, advanced computational capabilities, and transformative concepts for visualizing, using, analyzing and understanding geo phenomena and data.\nOpportunities for the scientific community to engage in addressing these challenges are available and being developed through NSF's portfolio of investments and activities. The NSF-wide initiative, Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science and Engineering (CIF21), looks to accelerate research and education through new capabilities in data, computation, software and other aspects of cyberinfrastructure. EarthCube, a joint program between GEO and the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Division, aims to create a well-connected and facile environment to share data and knowledge in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner, thus accelerating our ability to understand and predict the Earth system. EarthCube’s mission opens an opportunity for collaborative research on novel information systems enhancing and supporting geosciences research efforts. NSF encourages true, collaborative partnerships between scientists in computer sciences and the geosciences to meet these challenges.",

            "abstract": "Although nitrogen application in the form of fertilizers increases food production, excess nitrogen is harmful to the environment and to human well-being. Most watersheds have limited or no observational water quality data for estimating nitrogen load. Models predicting nitrogen load for various watersheds are utilized under such circumstances. However, existing model-based estimates of nitrogen loading to streams are limited either spatially (single river basin or small regional scale) or temporally (a single year). For developing strategies for reducing nutrient loads it is crucial to have knowledge of nitrogen loading for various regions of the country and over several time periods to understand the impact of precipitation variability on nitrogen loading. In this study we propose a parsimonious empirical model based on precipitation, land use and nitrogen input to the watershed and find that it explains 68% (76%) of the observed variability in annual total nitrogen (TN) flux (log(TN flux)) across 242 watersheds-years used in the model calibration. We use this model to create estimates of TN flux covering all HUC8 watersheds within the Continental United States and spanning the years 1987 to 2007. Results show that although net anthropogenic nitrogen input is the primary explanatory factor for average nutrient loading across years, the interannual variability in TN flux is primarily attributable to variability in precipitation for 86% of watersheds, which together represent 98% of the estimated TN flux for the continental U.S. These results crystallize the challenges associated with managing water quality impacts for systems where nitrogen input is the primary contributor to TN flux but precipitation controls its year-to-year variability.",

            "abstract": "Forest canopies intercept as much as 60% of snowfall in maritime environments, while processes of sublimation and melt can reduce the amount of snow transferred from the canopy to the ground. This research examines canopy interception efficiency (CIE) as a function of forest and event-scale snowfall characteristics. We use a 4-year dataset of continuous meteorological measurements and monthly snow surveys from the Forest Elevation Snow Transect (ForEST) network that has forested and open sites at three elevations spanning the rain-snow transition zone to the upper seasonal snow zone. Over 150 individual storms were classified by forest and storm type characteristics (e.g. forest density, vegetation type, air temperature, snowfall amount, storm duration, wind speed, and storm direction). The between-site comparisons showed that, as expected, CIE was highest for the lower elevation (warmer) sites with higher forest density compared with the higher elevation sites where storm temperatures were colder, trees were smaller and forests were less dense. Within-site comparisons based on storm type show that this classification system can be used to predict CIE.Our results suggest that the coupling of forest type and storm type information can improve estimates of canopy interception. Understanding the effects of temperature and storm type in temperate montane forests is also valuable for future estimates of canopy interception under a warming climate.",

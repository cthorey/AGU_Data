            "abstract": "Predictions of hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to natural and anthropogenic forcing at the landscape scale are highly uncertain due to the effects of heterogeneity on the scaling of reaction, flow and transport phenomena. The physical, chemical and biological structures and processes controlling reaction, flow and transport in natural landscapes interact at multiple space and time scales and are difficult to quantify. The current paradigm of hydrological and geochemical theory is that process descriptions derived from observations at small scales in controlled systems can be applied to predict system response at much larger scales, as long as some ‘equivalent’ or ‘effective’ values of the scale-dependent parameters can be identified. Furthermore, natural systems evolve in time in a way that is hard to observe in short-run laboratory experiments or in natural landscapes with unknown initial conditions and time-variant forcing. The spatial structure of flow pathways along hillslopes determines the rate, extent and distribution of geochemical reactions (and biological colonization) that drive weathering, the transport and precipitation of solutes and sediments, and the further evolution of soil structure. The resulting evolution of structures and processes, in turn, produces spatiotemporal variability of hydrological states and flow pathways. There is thus a need for experimental research to improve our understanding of hydrology-biogeochemistry interactions and feedbacks at appropriate spatial scales larger than laboratory soil column experiments. Such research is complicated in real-world settings because of poorly constrained impacts of initial conditions, climate variability, ecosystems dynamics, and geomorphic evolution. The Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) at Biosphere 2 offers a unique research facility that allows real-time observations of incipient hydrologic and biogeochemical response under well-constrained initial conditions and climate forcing. The LEO allows to close the water, carbon and energy budgets at hillslope scales, thereby enabling elucidation of the tight coupling between the time water spends along subsurface flow paths and geochemical weathering reactions, including the feedbacks between flow and pedogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society today. Assessing the impact of increasing temperatures and changing precipitation regimes on our ecosystems heavily relies on our ability to monitor and model changes in ecosystem response. At the same time, understanding how ecosystem changes feed back to the climate system greatly depends on our capability of measuring and modeling turbulent flux exchanges of energy, water, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurately quantifying these land surface turbulent fluxes at hillslope and small catchment scales is challenging. This is due to difficulties in closing energy and mass balances at such scales, as well as heterogeneities that exist at larger spatial scales as a result of small-scale variations in soil moisture, soil and vegetation characteristics, and energy distribution. The current generation of land surface models (LSMs) for use in Earth System Models (ESMs) operate at even larger spatial scales due to lack of sufficient computing power and data availability of land surface characteristics. Improving our understanding of how small-scale variations in land surface properties and states affect large-scale turbulent fluxes is urgently needed to improve existing parameterizations adopted in LSMs. For this purpose, observational facilities at different spatial scales and with different degrees of control are needed. At Biosphere 2 of the University of Arizona, we recently expanded the monitoring capabilities of the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO), to be able to: (1) accurately measure land surface fluxes of water, energy and carbon at the hillslope scale; (2) quantify small-scale variability of these fluxes across a moderately complex landscape; (3) analyze these small-scale observations of below- and aboveground processes to understand how they interact and feed back to induce large-scale fluxes; and (4) develop new parameterization schemes that account for sub-grid variability of observable land surface states and properties to predict turbulent fluxes at the hillslope scale from aggregated surface states, such as soil moisture. This presentation will provide an overview of the above-ground instrumentation as well as show early results of water and energy balance monitoring and modeling.",

            "abstract": "By which physical mechanisms does a river select its shape and size? We investigate this question using small laboratory rivers formed by laminar flows.\nIn its simplest form, this experiment consists in a flow of glycerol over a uniform layer of plastic sediments. After a few hours, a channel forms spontaneously, and eventually reaches a stable geometry. This equilibrium state corresponds accurately to the force balance proposed by Henderson (1961).\nIf we impose a sediment discharge at the inlet of the experiment, the river adjusts to this boundary condition by widening its channel. Observation suggests that this new equilibrium results from the balance between gravity, which pulls the entrained grains towards the center of the channel, and bedload diffusion, which returns them towards the banks. This balance explains why experimental rivers get wider and shallower as their sediment load increases.\nHowever, to test quantitatively this theory against observation, we need to evaluate independently the effect of transverse slope on bedload transport. We propose to use an instability generated by bedload diffusion to do so.",

            "abstract": "Over much of Mercury’s geologic history the planet has contracted as a response to cooling of its interior. Such contraction is evident as landforms formed by thrust faults, which have accommodated a radius decrease of ~5 km. Stresses from global contraction imposed on the lithosphere are not favorable for and prevent volcanism. Yet, there are examples on Mercury where pyroclastic deposits superpose thrust faults, indicating that explosive volcanism has occurred after the onset of global contraction. To better understand the spatial relationships of thrust faults with the pyroclastic vents, we used MESSENGER image data to categorize 343 vents by their occurrence either (1) within 30 km, (2) within 100 km, or (3) farther than 100 km from a thrust fault, using ArcGIS. Vents were also classified by their association with impact craters. Results show that 75% of all vents are located within impact structures, with 36% of vents within 30 km of thrust faults, 41% located farther than 30 but within 100 km of thrust faults, and 23% of vents are farther than 100 km from a thrust fault. To investigate whether this geospatial relationship is tectonically controlled, three areas —representing the three categories of vents— were mapped, and the locations and orientations of vents and faults were recorded. Stress changes around these faults were then numerically modeled with the COULOMB 3.4 software, using elastic rock properties, a background stress field, and fault size- and dislocation parameters applicable to conditions of Mercury’s global contractional tectonic environment. Preliminary results indicate that stress changes can locally produce conditions beneficial for volcanism. Further modeling will determine if such beneficial conditions are geospatially correlated with the pyroclastic vents and thus enable a better understanding of pyroclastic volcanism on Mercury after the onset of global contraction.",

            "abstract": "Under the Second West African Monsoon Model Evaluation Experiments project (WAMME-2), we have carried out model experiments to investigate multi-decadal variation of sea surface temperature (SST), and Saharan dust radiative forcing on the West Africa Monsoon (WAM), and associated dust emission and transport of. Comparing experiments with prescribed SST during the 1980s to the 1950s, we find that SST forcing significant alter the large-scale circulation, rainfall, and the dust emissions and transport during these two decades. Colder SST over northern Atlantic Ocean in 1980s strengthened the subtropical high and expanded it southwestward, compared to the 1950’s. As a result, the rain band over the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Sahel moves southward, and rainfall is reduced over the Sahel. Stronger surface winds associated with enhanced surface temperature gradients increase dust emission in the southern Saharan desert and northern Sahel. Combined with circulation changes induced by strengthening the subtropical high and reduced wet deposition, dust transport is increased in the deep tropics (10-20N), but relatively reduced in the northern path (20-30N)\nTo examine the role of the increased dust aerosol radiative forcing, additional experiments are conducted with reduced dust shortwave absorption. With reduced atmospheric heating by dust aerosol, model still simulates aforementioned contrast between 1980s and 1950s, but the anomalies of Sahel drought and dust transports is weaker. The atmospheric heating due to shortwave absorption by dust provides additional buoyance and lifts dust particles to higher altitudes. Dust radiative forcing also increases meridional temperature gradients and strengthens the African Easterly Jet, resulting in an increased residence time of dust and farther westward transport. Increased dust loading and lifetime further enhance dryness over the Sahel, but bring more rain to the south of the dust region.",

            "abstract": "We have performed quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and density functional theory calculations to study the equations of state and phase transitions in (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite (Pv, bridgmanite) and post-perovskite (PPv) .[1] The ground-state energies were derived using quantum QMC simulations and the temperature-dependent Helmholtz free energies were calculated within the quasiharmonic approximation and density functional perturbation theory. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) within Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a stochastic numerical solution of Schrödinger’s equation within the fixed many-particle nodes obtained, in our case, from a determinant of DFT orbitals. Agreement with experiments is improved over DFT alone. Furthermore, we obtain statistical error bounds on the results, rather than the unconstrained errors of DFT. The Pv-PPv phase boundary calculated from our QMC equations of state is also consistent with experiments, and better than previous DFT computations. In order to understand the H-phase reported in (Mg,Fe)SiO3 [2], we have performed evolutionary structure searching for FeSiO3.[3] We find a new structure type which may be consistent with the experimental observations, but is a lower pressure, less dense, phase. We have built a thermodynamic model for (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite as a function of P and T, and will discuss implications for the location of the phase boundary in D’’ and its double crossing [4].

            "abstract": "Earth's magnetic field was believed to arise from thermal convection of molten iron alloy in Earth's outer core, but density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the conductivity of iron is too high to support thermal convection, so that new geodynamo models were being developed. These DFT calculations considered the resistivity that arises from electrons scattering off of vibrating atoms (called electron-phonon scattering). It was believed since the 1930's that this would be the main contribution to electrical resistivity in metals. We find that electron scattering off of other electrons is just as important as electron-phonon scattering, and this brings the predicted transport properties of iron into agreement with geophysical estimates, and allows thermal convection to drive the geodynamo. Experiments at core conditions are extremely difficult, and transport properties in metals have considered mainly conventional electron-phonon processes at high temperatures. Other recent work will be reviewed and discussed. This work is supported by NSF and by the ERC Advanced grant ToMCaT.",

            "abstract": "First observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) in 2009, the mysterious band of neutral atom flux known as the IBEX ribbon is commonly attributed to the effect of a charge exchange between energetic neutral atoms originating in the inner heliosheath and secondary pickup ions (PUIs) gyrating in rings about local galactic magnetic field lines in the outer heliosheath and interstellar space. Underpinning this theory is the assumption that the newly formed PUI ring is fairly stable relative to wave generation, an assumption that has been challenged by previous simulations of ions in the local interstellar medium (LISM). However, recent data received from Voyager 1 as it entered interstellar space indicates that the LISM is much quieter than previously thought. Using linear kinetic theory and newly developed hybrid simulation software, equipped with a binning algorithm and Python interface to VisIt for 3D visualization, we reexamine the 2010 simulation of Florinski et al., investigate other possible PUI ring distributions such as the Gauss torus, and run new large scale simulations with over a billion particles for an unprecedented reduction in numerical noise. We also simulate PUI ring stability away from the ribbon, including the direction of Voyager 1’s trajectory, allowing us to compare our results with actual measurements of magnetic fluctuations in the LISM. Using these improved methods, we hope to gain new insight into the previously observed instability of PUI rings in the LISM. Preliminary results suggest that while broadened rings show very low levels of turbulence (in contrast with narrow rings of PUIs, which demonstrate abundant magnetic fluctuations at resonant frequency), some particle scattering occurred for every type of ring studied. The results of these simulations will be of critical importance to existing theories about the origins of the IBEX ribbon.",

            "abstract": "Magnetometer measurements from both the Oersted and CHAMP satellite have been combined together to create a database that is used to construct maps of the polar, magnetic field-aligned currents (FAC). As these satellite data span the time range of years 1999 to 2005 for Oersted and 2001 to 2010 for CHAMP, this large quantity is useful to investigate how the currents change under various conditions. This presentation will focus on the magnitude of the total current as a function of the interplanetary electric field (IEF), the product of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind velocity. This topic is of particular interest due to the numerous prior studies in the past, both experimental and theoretical, about the behavior of the polar cap electric potentials. Specifically, the electric potentials increase and then level off to a saturated value as the IMF and IEF increase in magnitude. The majority of the theoretical explanations for this saturation involve the \"Region 1\" currents.\nWhat has been found in this investigation is that the total FAC is highly linear as a function of the IEF, up to values of 8 mV/m, for all IMF clock angles. This is more than double the value of the IEF where the electric potentials exhibit the roll-off toward saturation. The linear slope does vary as a function of dipole tilt angle, which correlates with season; the summer hemisphere has a larger slope and higher currents than the winter hemisphere. In addition to looking at the total FAC values, the totals within the Regions 0, 1, and 2 have also been extracted from the FAC patterns, and it has been found that the linearity of the response curve is maintained. Above IEF values of 8 mV/m, corresponding to IMF magnitudes around 20 nT, the volume of data is very low, resulting in much uncertainty in the FAC values that are obtained, although there is some evidence that the total FAC does begin to saturate above 8 mV/m.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century (Costello et al, 2009; Watts et al, 2015). Perhaps one of the clearest examples of this is the summer heat wave of 2003, which saw up to seventy thousand excess deaths across Europe (Robine et al, 2007). The extreme temperatures are now thought to be significantly enhanced due to anthropogenic climate change (Stott et al, 2004; Christidis et al, 2015). Here, we consider not only the Europe-wide temperature response of the heat wave, but the localised response using a high-resolution regional model simulating 2003 climate conditions thousands of times. For the first time, by employing end-to-end attribution, we attribute changes in mortality to the increased radiative forcing from climate change, with a specific focus on London and Paris. We show that in both cities, a sizable proportion of the excess mortality can be attributed to human emissions. With European heat waves projected to increase into the future, these results provide a worrying reality for what may lie ahead.\nChristidis, Nikolaos, Gareth S. Jones, and Peter A.

            "abstract": "The buoyant migration of a non-wetting fluid in porous media occurs in several natural contexts, such as during CO2 sequestration, methane in cold seeps, DNAPLs infiltration in groundwater, oil recovery and magma chambers. In this study, we use numerical modeling and laboratory experiments to investigate the migration of buoyant non-wetting fluids in time-dependent (reactive) or spatially heterogeneous porous media. We find that the stress balance at the pore scale greatly influences the migration dynamics and regime of viscous energy dissipation of the flow (low Re) and therefore impacts the transport of non-wetting fluid even at the field scale. We consider two complementary pore-scale studies. In the first case, the migration of the non-wetting fluid is impacted by the concurrent dissolution of the porous medium because of the reactivity of the buoyant invading fluid. In the second scenario a chemically inert buoyant non-wetting fluid migrates across an heterogeneous medium, from a low porosity (and permeability) layer into a high porosity (high permeability) layer. We find that these two cases lead to a similar and counter-intuitive outcome: the migration of the buoyant non-wetting fluid is reduced at high porosity/permeability. These counter-intuitive results stem from the effect of confinement of the non-wetting fluid (volume available for invasion) and viscosity ratio between the immiscible fluids on the fluid migration at the pore scale. An important solid confinement (low porosity) stabilizes fingering pathways and promotes efficient transport, while high porosity promotes the formation of an emulsion with discrete bubbles or slugs of non-wetting fluids.",

Based on the general understanding of oceanic impacts on the TC genesis, many candidate factors are evaluated and discriminated, resulting in a new GPI index called GPIocean. GPIocean includes (1) the absolute vorticity at 1000 hPa, (2) the net sea surface longwave radiation, (3) the mean ocean temperature in the upper mixed layer, and (4) the depth of the 26°C isotherm. GPIocean is comparable to the existing GPIs in representing the TC genesis over the western North Pacific on climatological, interannual, and seasonal time scales.

            "abstract": "The multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method has been widely accepted as a quick and efficient technique for quantifying shear-wave (Vs) velocity to help resolve different subsurface geologic features. However, depth of imaging is directly related to frequency and active seismic sources may not generate surface waves with long enough wavelengths to sufficiently sample with the target. The passive MASW method, similar to the active method, utilizes multiple receivers to construct 2D velocity profiles, but harnesses ambient, coherent noise energy, which can provide lower frequencies and thus greater investigation depth compared to active or controlled source energy. Active source energy is controlled during a survey by the operator, whereas passive or ambient energy can originate from local sources at various azimuths. However, multi-azimuthal sources observed on a single record can enhance or interfere on the dispersion curve image (i.e., frequency – velocity spectrum) depending on the propagation direction of the seismic wavefront. Given this azimuthal factor and experience with active MASW, the quality of the overtone image is greatly dependent on the singularity of the signal. Over three years, a series of passive MASW surveys were acquired in south-central Kansas designed to observe and understand these varying effects of wide azimuthal train noise sources on overtone images. From these acquisitions, we discovered that no two train source signals are the same for the presented location. Picking the optimal source azimuth is critical to harnessing useful dispersion energy from the appropriate Rayleigh wave inducing source. Time window-splitting aided preliminary dispersion curve analysis, which allowed us to differentiate modes from passive sources at various azimuths that are otherwise compiled into a single image and result in degradation of the overtone image. Through a series of analyses in conjunction with time window-splitting, we have been able to better understand multi-azimuthal passive source energy and implications for dispersion curve images.",

NRV is the most active volcano in Colombia and since 2012 has generated small eruptions, with no casualties, and constant gas and ash emissions. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations from ascending and descending track RADARSAT-2 data show a large (>20 km) wide inflation pattern apparently starting in late 2011 to early 2012 and continuing to the time of this study in early 2015 at a LOS rate of over 3-4 cm/yr (Fig. 1). Volcano pressure volume models for both a point source (Mogi) and a spheroidal (Yang) source find solutions over 14 km beneath the surface, or 10 km below sea level, and centered 10 km to the SW of Nevado del Ruiz volcano. The spheroidal source has a roughly horizontal long axis oriented parallel to the Santa Isabel – Nevado del Ruiz volcanic line and perpendicular to the ambient compressive stress direction. Its solution provides a statistically significant improvement in fit compared to the point source, though consideration of spatially correlated noise sources may diminish this significance. Stress change computations do not favor one model over the other but show that propagating dikes would become trapped in sills, leading to a more complex pathway to the surface and possibly explaining the significant lateral distance between the modeled sources and Nevado del Ruiz volcano.",

Using these factors, we have studied 68 representative mountain ranges around the world; categorizing them into classes with similar physical characteristics. We also compare conventional and stable isotope measures of mountain drying ratio. We consider what advances must occur before GCMs can give accurate predictions of orographic precipitation",

            "abstract": "Starting in 1987, an all-sky airglow imaging system has operated from a site at the Millstone Hill/Haystack Observatory in Westford, MA. During the ~2½ solar cycles from 1987 to 2014, the most prominent storm-time optical feature observed from a sub-auroral site is a stable auroral red (SAR) arc. The standard use of a SAR arc’s position is to locate the ionospheric footprint of the narrow plasmapause-ring current interaction region where heat conduction from the inner magnetosphere excites emission within the F-layer trough. When mapped from an emission altitude of 400 km to the geomagnetic equatorial plane, SAR arcs from Millstone Hill give the location of the plasmapause at radial distances between 2 to 4.5 earth radii.\n A total of 377 SAR arcs have been observed during the 27 years of imaging at Millstone Hill. A significant number of their morphologies departed from the stability in space and time implied by its name. We have classified these into five categories: longevity, multiplicity, zonal structure, latitudinal inhomogeneity, and tilt with respect to geomagnetic coordinates. In each case, the implications for the inner magnetosphere sources that drive SAR arcs are explored. Collectively, the variable nature of SAR arcs is documented systematically for the first time—an aspect of solar-terrestrial physics not yet addressed in either magnetosphere or ionosphere modeling studies.",

Combined with projections of increased storm frequency from climate change, coral reef communities are facing unprecedented pressures. Water quality is a key index that can be used to assess stress on these environments. Current assessment methods are based on in situ measurements, suggesting the need for more effective monitoring. Satellite remote sensing provides timely and spatially explicit information regarding changes in aquatic systems once the data is calibrated using in situ measurements. The challenges when utilizing high resolution satellite sensors to acquire data in USVI are accounting for atmospheric path radiance, absorption from optically complex particles in the water column, and bottom reflectance from various substrates. In this study, field and lab based data were collected from 18 sites within the Caribbean Sea across St. Thomas and St. John to characterize optical water quality parameters (WQPs) (suspended sediments, phytoplankton, and colored dissolved organic matter) and bottom reflectance of different substrates. Results show that the optical properties of these waters are a function of multiple WQPs with chlorophyll-a values ranging from 0.10 to 2.35 µg/l and total suspended matter (TSM) values between 8.97 and 15.70 mg/l. Currently, a regionally tiered bio-optical model is being developed to accurately quantify WQPs in St. Thomas and St. John using multispectral and hyperspectral satellite sensors. Successful generation of this model would strongly advance tools for near-real-time and long-term monitoring at large spatial scales.",

            "abstract": "Stakeholders and regulators in the U.S. are generally uncertain as to the potential environmental impacts posed by deployments of marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) devices, and in particular wave energy conversion (WEC) devices, in coastal waters. The first pilot-scale WEC deployments in the U.S. have had to absorb unsustainable costs and delays associated with permitting to get devices in the water. As such, there is an urgent industry need to streamline the technical activities and processes used to assess potential environmental impacts. To enable regulators and stakeholders to become more comfortable and confident with developing effective MHK environmental assessments, a better understanding of the potential environmental effects induced by arrays of WEC devices is needed. A key challenge in developing this understanding is that the assessment of the WEC effects must come prior to deployment. A typical approach in similar environmental assessments is to use numerical models to simulate the WEC devices and array layouts so that the appropriate environmental stressors and receptors can be identified and assessed.\nSandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the U.S. Department of Energy are fulfilling the industry-wide need to develop “WEC-friendly” open-source numerical modeling tools capable of assessing potential changes to the physical environment caused by the operation of WEC arrays. Studies using these tools will advance the nation’s general knowledge of the interrelationships among the number, size, efficiency, and configuration of MHK arrays and the subsequent effects these relationships may have on the deployment environment. By better understanding these relationships, industry, stakeholders, and regulators will be able to work together to optimize WEC deployments such that environmental impacts are minimized while power output is maximized.\nThe present work outlines the initial effort in coupling the SNL WEC-friendly tools with the environmental assessment process. The development of the initial phases of a WEC case study in the offshore waters of Newport, Oregon will be presented. Examples of the quantitative evaluation of changes to important parameters that mau constitute an environmental stressors will be presented.",

We used a newly available dam removal science database and other information sources to explore seven frequently raised issues we call “Common Management Concerns” (CMCs), investigating their occurrence and the contributing biophysical controls. We describe these controls to enable managers to better assess if further analyses are warranted at their sites before interventions are planned and implemented. The CMCs addressed are: rate and degree of reservoir sediment erosion; drawdown impacts on local water infrastructure; excessive channel incision; downstream sediment aggradation; elevated turbidity; colonization of reservoir sediments by non-native plants; and expansion of invasive fish. The relative dearth of case studies available for many CMCs limited the generalizable conclusions we could draw about prevalence, but the available data and established understanding of relevant processes revealed important biophysical phenomena controlling the likelihood of CMC occurrence. To assess CMC risk, we recommend managers concurrently evaluate if site conditions suggest the ecosystem, infrastructure, or other human uses will be negatively affected if the biophysical phenomenon producing the CMC occurs. We show how many CMCs have one or more controls in common, facilitating the identification of multiple risks at a site, and demonstrate why CMC risks should be considered in the context of other important factors like watershed disturbance history, natural variability, and dam removal tradeoffs. Better understanding CMCs and how to evaluate them will enable practitioners to avoid unnecessary interventions and thus maximize opportunities for working with natural processes to restore river function.",

            "abstract": "Experimental degassing of H-, F-, Cl-, C-, and S-bearing species from volatile-bearing magma of lunar composition at low P and fO2 close to quartz-iron-fayalite indicates that the composition of the fluid/vapor phase that is lost changes over time. A highly H-rich vapor phase is exsolved within the first 10 min. of degassing leaving behind a melt that is effectively dehydrated. Some Cl, F, and S is also lost during this time, presumably as HCl, HF, and H2S gaseous species; however much of the original inventory of Cl, F, and S components are retained in the melt. After 10 min., the exsolved vapor is dry and dominated by S- and halogen-bearing phases, presumably consisting of metal halides and sulfides, which evolves over time towards F enrichment. This vapor evolution provides important constraints on the geochemistry of volatile-bearing lunar phases that form subsequent to or during degassing. The rapidity of H loss suggests that little if any OH-bearing apatite will crystallize from surface or near surface (≈7m) melts and that degassing of lunar magmas will cause the compositions of apatites to evolve first towards the F-Cl apatite binary and eventually towards end member fluorapatite during crystallization. During the stage of loss of primarily H component from the melt, Cl would have been lost primarily as HCl, which is reported not to fractionate Cl isotopes at magmatic temperatures. After the loss of H-bearing species, continued loss of Cl would result in the degassing of metal chlorides, as a mechanism to fractionate Cl isotopes. After the onset of metal chloride degassing, the δ37Cl of the melt would increase to +6 (82% Cl loss), +8 (85% Cl loss), and +20‰ (95% Cl loss) at 1, 4, and 6 hours, respectively, approximated in a computed trajectory of δ37Cl values in basalt during degassing of FeCl2. This strong enrichment of 37Cl in the melt after metal chloride volatilization is fully consistent with values measured for the non-leachates of a variety of lunar samples and would be reflected in apatites crystallized from a degassing melt. We suggest that a range in δ37Cl from 0 to > 20‰ is expected in lunar apatite, with heavy enrichment being the norm. Importantly, such enrichments can occur in spite of high initial H-contents, and therefore, demonstrate that elevated values of δ37Cl cannot be used as supporting evidence for an anhydrous Moon.",

            "abstract": "Marine sediment records reveal episodes of increased ice rafted debris (IRD) to the subpolar N. Atlantic (40N-50N) during deglaciation that are linked to the calving of enormous numbers of icebergs from the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. There is considerable interest, and uncertainty, as to whether meltwater from these icebergs freshened the ocean sufficiently to weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Very recently, hundreds of iceberg scours have been observed along the east coast of the United States as far south as Florida. The iceberg scours are oriented SSW along the coast and are observed in water depths up to several hundred meters deep, indicating that massive (up to 300m thick) icebergs once drifted along the east coast of N. America into the subtropics during deglaciation. A newly developed iceberg model (MITberg) is coupled to an eddy-permitting ocean model to show that icebergs are carried south to Florida by coastally-confined meltwater currents caused by the sudden release of large volumes of meltwater from Hudson Bay and/or Gulf of St. Lawrence. When meltwater fluxes exceed 2.5Sv simulated icebergs drift as far south as Miami, Florida, and thousands are carried into the center of the subtropical gyre by narrow meltwater filaments and instabilities along the boundary current. When the meltwater flood ends, icebergs can no longer drift into the subtropics, and quickly become confined to the subpolar gyre where the majority of IRD is found. Our results indicate that icebergs and meltwater from the north did not always directly freshening the subpolar gyre, but were periodically transported south of the main subpolar deep water formation regions that regulate AMOC strength and climate. Dating the observed iceberg scours will tell us exactly how active and persistent this coastally-confined meltwater pathway was during deglaciation and help us unravel why there is not always a clear relationship between increased high latitude freshwater forcing and climate cooling.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. is testing approaches for accounting for carbon emissions and removals associated with wetland management according to 2013 IPCC Wetlands Supplement guidelines. Quality of reporting is measured from low (Tier 1) to high (Tier 3) depending upon data availability and analytical capacity. The use of satellite remote sensing data to derive carbon stocks and flux provides a practical approach for moving beyond IPCC Tier 1, the global default factor approach, to support Tier 2 or Tier 3 quantification of carbon emissions or removals. We are determining the “price of precision,” or the extent to which improved satellite data will continue to increase the accuracy of “blue carbon” accounting. Tidal marsh biomass values are needed to quantify aboveground carbon stocks and stock changes, and to run process-based models of carbon accumulation. Maps of tidal marsh biomass have been produced from high resolution commercial and moderate resolution Landsat satellite data with relatively low error [percent normalized RMSE (%RMSE) from 7 to 14%]. Recently for a brackish marsh in Suisun Bay, California, we used Landsat 8 data to produce a biomass map that applied the Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) (ρNIR*0.2 – ρR)/(ρNIR*0.2+ρR) to fully vegetated pixels and the Simple Ratio index (ρRed/ρGreen) to pixels with a mix of vegetation and water. Overall RMSE was 208 g/m2, while %RMSE = 13.7%. Also, preliminary use of airborne and spaceborne RADAR data in coastal Louisiana produced a marsh biomass map with 30% error. The integration of RADAR and LiDAR with optical remote sensing data has the potential to further reduce error in biomass estimation. In 2017, nations will report back to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change on their experience in applying the Wetlands Supplement guidelines. These remote sensing efforts will mark an important step toward quantifying human impacts to wetlands within the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "This contribution deals with subduction-related submarine magmatism. We are offering a tool to contribute to delimitation of domains of current magma unrest at convergent plate margins and to understand better the behavior of magma in the lithospheric wedge above the subducting slab: a detailed analysis of teleseismic earthquake occurrence. A specific seismicity pattern has been observed beneath submarine portions of several volcanic arcs at convergent plate margins (Andaman Sea region, southern Ryukyu area). We have found three arguments that allowed us to interpret such a seismicity pattern as a magma-driven process: (i) clustering of medium-size earthquakes (M~5) in space and time in shallow earthquake swarms; (ii) rapid migration of seismic activity during the swarms (comparison of epicentral maps of individual stages of the swarm development showed consistently that earthquake epicenters migrate laterally at a rate of several hundred meters per hour); (iii) correlation of epicentral zones of the swarms with distinct seamounts and submarine ridges (current seismically active intrusions probably propagate along plumbing systems that served as conduits of magma to the surface in the past). The repeated occurrence of relatively strong, teleseismically recorded earthquake swarms thus probably reflects fluid and/or magma ascent through the plumbing system of the volcanic arc, points to brittle character of the lithospheric wedge at respective depths and favors the studied areas – the Andaman Sea region and the southern Ryukyu area – to be potential sites of submarine volcanic activity.. The study documents high accuracy of hypocenter parameter determinations published by data centers such as ISC and NEIC USGS, and the usefulness of the EHB relocation procedure.",

Understanding how these impurities affect the rheology, intrinsic thermodynamic properties, and ultimate fate of these ice sheets, however, is much less understood. One such soluble impurity thought to be of critical importance and already shown to be significant in the flow of single crystal ice, is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid). In order to further investigate the effects that trace amounts (< 10 ppm) of sulfuric acid may also have on the flow and ductility of polycrystalline ice, we have conducted a series of mechanical tests at -10°C and -20°C. These tests have included uniaxial tensile creep tests at a constant load of 0.5 and 0.75 MPa and uniaxial compression tests at a constant strain rate of 1x10-5 s-1. Pre and post-test microstructural analysis has been performed via scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction. Although these experiments are still ongoing, our tentative results show a temperature dependent difference in the strain rate between pure and sulfuric acid doped creep specimens and a difference in the peak stress achieved for our samples tested in compression.",

A variety of possible causes have been suggested to explain this southeast U.S. “warming hole”, including changes in Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) due to internal variability, forcing from anthropogenic aerosols, and changes in local hydrology due to land-use change. Here we investigate some of these mechanisms using the GFDL-CM3 chemistry climate model, one of the CMIP5 models best able to capture the observed warming hole. We use the “aerosol only” and “greenhouse gas only” single forcing simulations to further develop our understanding of the potential drivers of the warming hole. We find that in both simulations, temperatures in the southeast U.S. exhibit a weaker response to anthropogenic forcing compared with the rest of the country, suggesting a preferred regional mode of response that is largely independent of the type of forcing. Increasing anthropogenic aerosols weaken the Bermuda High, reducing the transport of moisture into the southeast U.S. from the Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, total cloud fraction, precipitation, and soil moisture content are also reduced. These changes are associated with an increase in the surface absorption of shortwave (SW) radiation, thus offsetting the expected cooling due to the radiative effects of the aerosols, and creating a “cooling hole” in the aerosol only simulation. In the greenhouse gas only simulation, there is an opposite-signed response, with increases in the Bermuda High strength and moisture flux into the southeast U.S, and decreases in the surface SW absorption. Finally, the impacts of Pacific and Atlantic SST changes, both forced and internal, on the simulated temperature in the southeast U.S. are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Weak phases in polyphase materials can significantly affect the bulk rheology of the aggregate. Quantifying the rheologic effects of weak minor phases is critical for understanding possible conditions that facilitate large-scale tectonic processes. Recent experimental studies demonstrate that polyphase aggregates deformed in shear approach an isostress topology at relatively low shear strains. We conducted general shear deformation experiments on ilmenite and olivine aggregates at an axial strain rate of 10-5 s-1 and 10-6 s-1. Experiments were conducted at 1000°C and 1 GPa with a grain size of 10-20 um for both ilmenite and olivine. The volume percent of ilmenite ranges from 5 to 25%. Preliminary results demonstrate that the samples reach a peak stress, weaken, and then reach a mechanical steady state. The greater the volume percent of ilmenite in the sample, the weaker the bulk strength of the sample and the less weakening is observed after peak stress. The aggregate rheologies of the samples approach the isostress bound. Microstructural observation of a sample composed of 10% ilmenite deformed at 10-5 s-1 displays limited ilmenite interconnection, but still show aggregate strengths approaching the isostress bound. Illmenite grains are flattened and elongated consistent with the sense of shear. As ilmenite grains rotate into the shear plane, strain partitioning into the weaker ilmenite allows the aggregate to approach an isostress rheology without the interconnection of the majority of ilmenite grains. Results from this study show that the presence of small amounts of ilmenite can significantly reduce the bulk viscosity of dunite, which has important implications for lunar cumulate mantle overturn. Further results will help place important constraints on the rheology of an ilmenite-bearing lunar cumulate mantle which is critical in determining the thermal and chemical evolution of the Moon. Ilmenite has also been observed in gabbroic shear zones in drill cores from oceanic crust and in ophiolites. Our results suggest that ilmenite would reduce the effective viscosity of an ilmenite-gabbro aggregate, facilitating shear localization and perhaps even low-temperature aseismic creep in oceanic crust.",

Although mesoscale organizing has been studied by many previous literatures, it is still difficult to introduce the physics of organization to GCMs due to some unclear complicated processes. To this challenge, an exploring approach is proposed in this study to investigate the interactions between organized systems and background thermodynamic environment. The 16-yr Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) dataset is used to characterize the precipitating features. A feature with large rain area is the proxy of an organized system, which includes convective and stratiform precipitation regions embedded with convection at various stages. ECMWF reanalysis of atmospheric fields are collocated to characterize the immediate environments. The resolution of atmospheric variables is comparable to a grid box in current climate model. The motivation is to investigate the characteristic of grid-box mean environment corresponding to organized rain systems. Following questions will be addressed:\nWhich model-resolved atmospheric variables are identified to be closely associated with the aggregation of precipitating system, such as moisture, low-level wind shear, moisture convergence, atmospheric instability etc.?\nIf a particular environmental condition at model grid is given, can we reproduce the fractional rainfall contribution from large precipitating systems?\nThis study aims to provide some observational supports for the systematic relationships between organized systems and their environments, based on a large number of sample data.

            "abstract": "Operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems occasionally exhibit “forecast skill dropouts” in which the forecast skill drops to an abnormally low level, due in part to the assimilation of flawed observational data. Recent studies have shown that a diagnostic technique called Ensemble Forecast Sensitivity to Observations (EFSO) can detect such observations (Kalnay et.al 2012; Ota et al. 2013, Tellus A). Based on this technique, a new Quality Control (QC) scheme called Proactive QC (PQC) has been proposed which detects “flawed” observations using EFSO after just 6 hours forecast, when the analysis at the next cycle becomes available for verification and then repeats the analysis and forecast without using the detected observations (Hotta 2014).\nIn Hotta (2014), it was shown using the JCSDA S4 Testbed that the 6hr PQC reduces the 24-hour forecast errors from the detected skill dropout events. With such encouraging results we are performing preliminary experiments towards operational implementation. First, we show that offline PQC correction can significantly reduce forecast errors up to 5 days, and that the reduction and improved areal coverage can grow with synoptic weather disturbances for several days. Second, with online PQC cycle experiment the reduction of forecast error is shown to be even larger than in the offline version, since the effect could accumulate over each time we perform a PQC correction. Finally, the operational center imposes very tight schedule in order to deliver the products on time, thus the computational cost has to be minimized in order for PQC to be implemented. To avoid performing the analysis twice, which is the most expensive part of PQC, we test the accuracy of constant-K approximation, which assumes the Kalman gain K doesn’t change much given the fact that only a small subset of observation is rejected. In this presentation, we will demonstrate the performance and feasibility of PQC implementation in real-time operational environment.",

In this study the capabilities of a range of statistical analysis methods are assessed in producing improved estimates of global near-surface temperature change since the mid 19th century for observational coverage in the HadCRUT4 data set. Methods used include those that interpolate according to local correlation structure (kriging) and reduced space methods that learn large-scale temperature patterns.\nThe performance of each method in estimating regional and global temperature changes has been benchmarked in application to a subset of CMIP5 simulations. Model fields are sub-sampled and simulated observational errors added to emulate observational data, permitting assessment of temperature field reconstruction algorithms in controlled tests in which globally complete temperature fields are known.\nThe reconstruction methods have also been applied to the HadCRUT4 data set, yielding a range of estimates of global near-surface temperature change since the mid 19th century. Results show relatively increased warming in the global average over the 21st century owing to reconstruction of temperatures in high northern latitudes, supporting the findings of Cowtan & Way (2014) and Karl et al. (2015). While there is broad agreement between estimates of global and hemispheric changes throughout much of the 20th and 21st century, agreement is reduced in the 19th and early 20th century. This finding is supported by the climate model trials that highlight uncertainty in reconstructing data sparse regions, most notably in the Southern Hemisphere in the 19th century. These results underline the importance of continued data rescue activities, such as those of the International Surface Temperature Initiative and ACRE.\nThe results of this study will form an addition to the HadCRUT4 global near-surface temperature data set.",

Here we discuss a number of important differences between ensemble-based and variational methods that must be accounted for if one attempts to fuse these methods. The main difference between ensemble-based and variational methods is the interpretation of what the forecast covariance matrix is that is required by a data assimilation system whose state estimate is to be the posterior mean (ensemble method) or the posterior mode (4DVar). This difference has important implications to both the interpretation of the resulting state estimate and the design of data assimilation algorithms that fuse aspects of ensemble and variational techniques.",

            "abstract": "Effective water resources management depends on the reliable estimation of the uncertainty of drought events. Confidence intervals (CIs) are commonly applied to quantify this uncertainty. A CI seeks to be at the minimal length necessary to cover the true value of the estimated variable with the desired probability. In drought analysis where two or more variables (e.g., duration and severity) are often used to describe a drought, copulas have been found suitable for representing the joint probability behavior of these variables. However, the comprehensive assessment of the parameter uncertainties of copulas of droughts has been largely ignored, and the few studies that have recognized this issue have not explicitly compared the various methods to produce the best CIs. Thus, the objective of this study to compare the CIs generated using two widely applied uncertainty estimation methods, bootstrapping and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To achieve this objective, (1) the marginal distributions lognormal, Gamma, and Generalized Extreme Value, and the copula functions Clayton, Frank, and Plackett are selected to construct joint probability functions of two drought related variables. (2) The resulting joint functions are then fitted to 200 sets of simulated realizations of drought events with known distribution and extreme parameters and (3) from there, using bootstrapping and MCMC, CIs of the parameters are generated and compared. The effect of an informative prior on the CIs generated by MCMC is also evaluated. CIs are produced for different sample sizes (50, 100, and 200) of the simulated drought events for fitting the joint probability functions. Preliminary results assuming lognormal marginal distributions and the Clayton copula function suggest that for cases with small or medium sample sizes (~50-100), MCMC to be superior method if an informative prior exists. Where an informative prior is unavailable, for small sample sizes (~50), both bootstrapping and MCMC yield the same level of performance, and for medium sample sizes (~100), bootstrapping is better. For cases with a large sample size (~200), there is little difference between the CIs generated using bootstrapping and MCMC regardless of whether or not an informative prior exists.",

The phenomena was captured at multiple times and viewing geometries from a large assortment of geostationary (GOES) and polar-orbiting (A-Train and Suomi-NPP) satellites. Between 1945 and 2000 UTC, a large anvil had formed atop the intensifying pyroCb, and at approximately 2020 UTC, the A-Train passed directly over the active pyroCb column. This overpass allowed for a rare penetration into the internal structure of this type of convection with nadir-viewing instruments: the CloudSat radar (94 GHz) and the CALIOP lidar (1064 and 532 nm). Thermal infrared (10.8 um) brightness temperatures from MODIS at the time of the A-Train overpass were lower than -60 C, which, in combination with the ~13.5 km height of the overshooting top observed by CALIOP, indicated penetration into the lower stratosphere.\nThis presentation compares the aerosol-laden GSL pyroCb with a concurrent meteorological cumulonimbus (pristine environment, classical Cb) that developed within the same region. The large-scale synoptic conditions which preface the pyroCb and Cb formation are similar, but CloudSat and CALIOP indicate two very different internal convective structures, much of which may be attributable to aerosol loading. Many interesting aspects of this case study will be discussed, including: i) insights gained by the observations of the external morphology and internal convective structure by passive and active sensors, ii) the impact of the heavy smoke loading on pyroCb microphysics, iii) the long lifetime of the detrained pyroCb ice anvil compared to pristine environment Cb and iv) the increase in stratospheric water vapor from the detrained anvil.",

            "abstract": "We used shallow seismic refraction to image near-surface materials in the vicinity of a small group of hot springs, located in the Morning Mist Springs area of Lower Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Seismic velocities in the area surveyed range from a low of 0.3 km/s to a high of approximately 2.5 km/s. The survey results indicate an irregular surface topography overlain by silty sediments. The observed seismic velocities are consistent with a subsurface model in which sorted sands and gravels, probably outwash materials from the Pinedale glaciation, are overlain by silts and ﬁne sands deposited in the ﬂat-lying areas of the Morning Springs area. These ﬁndings are supported by published geologic maps of the area and well logs from a nearby borehole. The near-surface materials appear to be saturated with discharging hydrothermal ﬂuids of varying temperature, and interbedded with semi-lithiﬁed geothermal deposits (sinter). We hypothesize that the relatively low-conductivity deposits of ﬁnes at the surface may serve to conﬁne a shallow, relatively low-temperature (sub-boiling) hydrothermal aquifer, and that the distribution of sinter in the shallow subsurface plays an important role in determining the geometry of hydrothermal discharge (hot springs) at the land surface. Few studies of the shallow controls on hot spring expression exist for the Yellowstone caldera, and the present study therefore oﬀers a unique glimpse into near-subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow controls. ",

            "abstract": "The dissolution of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) into groundwater is a highly complex process due to the heterogeneous subsurface hydrogeology and NAPL distribution. The objective of this study is to relate the temporal variations of groundwater flux in the NAPL source zone to the NAPL dissolution dynamics. The main idea is that the temporal variation of NAPL source zone groundwater flux is directly related to the source zone NAPL mass discharge into the aqueous phase. By incorporating this new idea, the NAPL source dynamics including source zone concentrations, reduction in the NAPL mass discharge to the aqueous phase, reduction in the NAPL mass in the source zone can be effectively related. In this study, we developed new models that could be used to predict the source zone strength. In illustrating the new model development, we use a functional form of NAPL source zone water flux with a range of rate change to accommodate a range of potential variations of water flux. These models simply predict how the NAPL source zone characteristics changes with time, which can be easily used in modeling subsequent fate and transport. The models developed have already taken in account the requirement of NAPL mass conservation. Based on the developed models, we discuss how NAPL source zone concentrations, NAPL mass discharge, and remaining NAPL mass in the source zone are inter-related. Comparison with field data demonstrates that the models are capable of capturing source zone NAPL discharge dynamics estimated from field experiments.",

            "abstract": "A quantitative understanding of air entrainment is critical to predicting the behaviors of dilute Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs), including runout distance, liftoff, and mass fractionation into co-PDC plumes. We performed experiments in an 8.5x6x2.6 meter tank using 20 micron talc powder over a range of conditions to describe air entrainment as a function of temperature, duration and mass flux. The experiments are reproducible and are scaled with respect to the densimetric and thermal Richardson numbers (Ri and RiT), Froude number, thermal to kinetic energy density ratio (TEb/KE), Stokes number, and Settling number, such that they are dynamically similar to natural dilute PDCs. Experiments are illuminated with a swept laser sheet and imaged at 1000 Hz to create 3D reconstructions of the currents, with ~1-2 cm resolution, at up to 1.5 Hz. An array of 30 high-frequency thermocouples record the precise temperature in the currents at 3 Hz. Bulk entrainment rates are calculated based on measured current volumes, surface areas, temperatures and velocities. Entrainment rates vary from ~0-0.9 and do not show simple variation with TEb/KE, Ri, or RiT. Entrainment does, however, increase with decreasing eruption duration and increasing mass flux. Our results suggest that current heads entrain air more efficiently than current bodies (>0.5 compared to ~0.1). Because shorter duration currents have proportionally larger heads, their bulk entrainment rates are controlled by those heads, whereas longer duration currents are dominated by their bodies. Our experiments demonstrate that air entrainment, which exerts a fundamental control on PDC runout and liftoff, varies spatially and temporally within PDCs.",

The Bahia Soledad Fault is a NNW-trending strike-slip fault that is likely continuous with the San Diego Trough Fault offshore of San Diego, California. Constraining the style of deformation, continuity, and slip rate along this fault system is critical to characterizing the seismic hazards to the adjacent coastal areas extending from Los Angeles to Ensenada. Detailed morphologic surveys were conducted using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to provide ultra high-resolution multibeam bathymetry (vertical precision of 0.15 m and horizontal resolution of 1.0 m). The AUV also carried a 2-10 kHz chirp sub-bottom profiler and an Edgetech 110kHz and 410kHz sidescan. The two sites along the Bahia Soledad Fault each run ~6 km along the fault with ~1.8 km wide footprint. The resulting bathymetry shows these fault zones are marked with distinct lineations that are flanked by ~1 km long elongated ridges and depressions which are interpreted to be transpressional pop-up structures and transtensional pull-apart basins up to 100 m of relief. Offset seismic reflectors that extend to near the seafloor confirm that these lineations are fault scarps. The detailed bathymetric maps and sub-bottom profiles were used to locate key sites where deformed stratigraphic horizons along the fault are within 1.5 m of the seafloor. These areas were sampled using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with a vibracoring system capable of collecting precisely located cores that are up to 1.5 m long. The coupled use of multibeam imagery and surgically-collected stratigraphic samples will enable to constrain the frequency and timing of recent movements on this fault which will be useful to incorporated into future seismic hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing interest in clarifying the significance of local versus nonlocal formulations of sediment transport on hillslopes. Some work has been done to try to match nonlocal formulations to hillslope profiles, but there is limited work on how individual processes affect hillslope geometry. One such process is dry ravel of sediment in steepland environments following storage in “sediment capacitors.” Specifically, vegetation can act as sediment capacitors which temporarily store, then release sediment upon death. We are pursuing experiments using a laboratory scale hillslope that mimic dry ravel in order to explore the influence of sediment storage and release on hillslopes. These experiments attempt to recreate the long-distance sediment motions likely in sediment capacitor release. These experiments are designed to inform models that incorporate effects of these long-distance motions on hillslopes. Initial numerical simulations, together with field observations from moraines in the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains, suggest that shrubs can locally, temporarily ‘dam’ and store significant amounts sediment arriving from upslope. Eventually shrubs release this sediment as ravel (and possibly by other surface transport processes) downslope, including delivery to storage behind shrubs. Though these sediment capacitors are just one facet of the transport story, they may represent an important process that modulates the rate of hillslope evolution.",

            "abstract": "LiDAR can be used to obtain elevation data for areas spread over several kilometers, and it has a spatial resolution of a few tens of centimeters. Therefore, it is suitable for detecting the surface deformation associated with inland earthquakes. We applied this technique to assess surface deformation associated with the 2014 Kamishiro fault earthquake (Mw6.3) in central Japan. High-resolution LiDAR data was obtained before and after the earthquake, and therefore we can analyze the difference. Our results revealed the crustal movement distribution over a wide area and surface ruptures associated with the earthquake.\nAs a result, surface deformation that has been detected by LiDAR is consistent with what has been confirmed as surface ruptures by our field survey. Since the ruptures were often accompanied by broader deformation with wavelength on the order of tens of meters, a sufficiently wide range of surveying tools, including a total station or UAVs, was required to evaluate the entire deformation in the field survey. The observed amount of relative east-side-up displacement can be up to 1 m in the field, and that of the left-lateral offset was less than 1 m. Differential LiDAR is advantageous in that we can evaluate not only relative but absolute desplacement along the fault line.\nThe Kamishiro fault forms the northernmost part of the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line, one of the most dominant active faults in Japan. Here, a displacement of more than 3 m has been estimated to occur once in a thousand years by previous studies. However, the displacement observed after the 2014 earthquake was less than one-third of the estimated value. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider the characteristic earthquake associated with the Kamishiro fault. In addition, strong ground motion of seismic intensity 7 occurred locally in the Kamishiro basin. It should be noted that similar damage is recorded to have occurred in this region following the 1714 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Our message is that if we think of reconnection with the usual cartoon, the MMS mission should follow the advice of Indiana Jones: X never marks the spot. Based on 3D fully kinetic simulations started with a well defined x-line, we observe that reconnection transitions towards a more chaotic regime. Two fronts develop downstream of the x-line where the outflow meets the pre-existing plasma. In the fronts an instability develops caused by the local gradients of the density. The consequence is the break up of the fronts in a fashion similar to the classical fluid Rayleigh-Taylor instability with the formation of “fingers” of plasma and embedded magnetic fields. These fingers interact and produce secondary reconnection sites.\nWe present several different diagnostics that prove the existence of these secondary reconnection sites. Each site is surrounded by its own electron diffusion region.\nAt the fronts the ions are generally not magnetized and considerable ion slippage is present. The discovery we present is that electrons are also slipping, forming localized diffusion regions near secondary reconnection sites [1].\nThe consequence of this discovery is twofold. First, the instability in the fronts has strong energetic implications. We observe that the energy transfer locally is very strong, an order of magnitude stronger than in the “X” line. However, this energy transfer is of both signs as it is natural for a wavy rippling with regions of magnetic to kinetic and regions of kinetic to magnetic energy conversion.\nSecond, and most important for this session, is that MMS should not limit the search for electron diffusion regions to the location marked with X in all reconnection cartoons. Our simulations predict more numerous and perhaps more easily measurable electron diffusion regions in the fronts.\n[1] Lapenta, G et al., Nature Physics 11, 690–695 (2015)",

            "abstract": "Chloride salt-bearing deposits have been identified throughout the southern highlands of Mars [1] based on the lack of diagnostic spectral features of anhydrous chlorides in both the visible near infrared (VNIR) and middle infrared (MIR) wavelength ranges [1,2]. A puzzling aspect of martian chloride deposits is the apparent lack of other weathering or evaporite phases associated with most of the deposits. A global analysis over the chloride salt sites conducted by [3] found that only ~9% of the deposits they analyzed were associated with minerals such as phyllosilicates. Most of these occurrences are in Terra Sirenum where [4] noted that salt-bearing deposits lie stratigraphically above Noachian phyllosilicates. Although a variety of formation mechanisms have been proposed for these intriguing deposits, detailed geologic mapping by [5] suggests that surface water and evaporation played a dominant role. On Earth, evaporative settings are often characterized by a multitude of evaporite and phyllosilicate phases including carbonates, sulfates, and nitrates. [6] evaluated chemical divides and brine evolution for martian systems and their results indicate three pathways wherein late-stage brines favor chloride precipitation. In each case the pathway to chloride formation includes precipitation of carbonates (calcite, siderite, and/or magnesite) and sulfates (gypsum, melanterite, and/or epsomite). Here, we present the results of our detailed and systematic spectroscopic study to identify additional evaporite phases associated with salt/silicate mixtures in Terra Sirenum.\n[1] Osterloo et al.

            "abstract": "Concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been increasing in many aquatic ecosystems. In snow-dominated systems, longer growing seasons and shifts in precipitation from snow to rain are expected to increase terrestrial DOM loading in lakes. In particular, high-elevation lakes are susceptible to the effects of rain-induced loading because they are often located in steep catchments with thin soils and impermeable rock outcrops that rapidly channel runoff. Observational studies have linked rain-induced loading with increased lake DOM and nutrient concentrations, altering ecosystem metabolic rates. However, the aquatic ecosystem response to different magnitudes of terrestrial DOM loading remains unclear. We hypothesize that low levels of DOM loading will stimulate rates of primary production to a greater extent than heterotrophic respiration as phytoplankton in these oligotrophic lakes exploit increased inorganic nutrient availability, ultimately increasing net ecosystem production. In contrast, we expect high levels of loading to suppress rates of gross primary production through reduced transparency of photosynthetically active radiation, while stimulating heterotrophic respiration through increased DOM substrate availability for bacterioplankton. We predict there will be a threshold DOM-loading level above which net ecosystem metabolism becomes heterotrophic. To test these hypotheses we conducted a series of in situ incubations of lake water amended with soil DOM extracted from catchment Entisols and Inceptisols. Background concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in these lakes are typically ~60 - 80 μM during the ice-free season. Incubation treatments included a control with ambient DOC concentration, soil DOM additions targeting +10 μM, +20 μM, +60 μM, +190 μM, +440 μM, and +940 μM DOC, and a nutrient amendment matching inorganic N and P concentrations in the highest soil DOM treatment. We develop models that predict phytoplankton and bacterioplankton dynamics and ecosystem metabolic rates along this gradient of terrestrial loading. Such models are critical to understanding how aquatic ecosystems may change in response to the ‘browning’ of inland waters.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities have dominated heavy metal (such as Cd, Pb, and Zn) cycling in many environments. The extent and fate of these metal depositions in topsoils, however, have not been adequately evaluated. Here, we utilize an innovative Cadmium (Cd) isotope tool to trace the sources of metal pollutants in topsoils collected from surrounding a Vanadium Titanium Magnetite smelting plant in Sichuan, China.\nTopsoil samples and possible pollution end-members such as fly ashes, bottom ashes, ore materials, and coal were also collected from the region surrounding the smelting plant and were analyzed for Cd isotope ratios (d114Cd relative to Cd NIST 3108). Large Cd isotope fractionation (up to 3 ‰) was observed in these industrial end-members: fly ashes possessed higher δ114Cd values ranging from +0.03 to +0.19‰; bottom fly ashes have lower δ114Cd values ranging from -0.35 to -2.46‰; and unprocessed ore and coal samples has δ114Cd value of -0.40‰. This fractionation can be attributed to the smelting processes during which bottom ashes acquired lighter Cd isotope signatures while fly ashes were mainly characterized by heavy isotope ratios, in comparison to the unprocessed ore and coal samples. Indeed, δ114Cd values of topsoils in the smelting area range from 0.29 to -0.56‰, and more than half of the soils analyzed have distinct δ114Cd values > 0‰. Cd isotopes and concentrations measured in topsoils suggested that processed materials (fly and bottom ashes from ore and coal actually used by the smelting plant) were the major source of Cd in soils. In a δ114Cd vs 1/Cd mixing diagram, the soils represent a mixture of three identified end members (fly ash, bottom ash and deep unaffected soil) with distinct Cd isotopic compositions and concentrations. Deep soils have the same δ114Cd values range as the unprocessed ore and coal, which indicated the Cd isotope fractionation did occur during evaporation and condensation processes inside the smelting plant. The signatures of fly ash end member might be even higher according to the δ114Cd increasing trend of topsoils with the increasing of Cd concentration of the topsoils. Our study suggested that δ114Cd values can be used to distinguish sources of anthropogenic Cd and to construct metal budgets in in this studying area.",

            "abstract": "It is now common knowledge that dispersive scale Alfvén waves can drive parallel electron acceleration [Lotko et al., JGR, 1998; Samson et al., Ann. Geophys., 2003; Wygant et al., JGR, 2002] and transverse ion energization in the auroral zone and inner magnetosphere [Johnson and Cheng, JGR, 2001; Chaston et al., 2004]. In this paper we show that relatively low energy electrons (plasma sheet electrons with energies ranging up to ∼100 eV) can be accelerated very efficiently as they interact nonlinearly with kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) that carry intense field aligned currents from the equatorial plane toward the ionosphere in the inner magnetosphere. We propose a theoretical model describing electron trapping into an effective wave potential generated by parallel wave electric fields (with perpendicular wavelengths on the order of the ion gyro-radius) and the mirror force acting on electrons as they propagate along geomagnetic field lines. We demonstrate that waves with an electric potential amplitude between ~100 − 400 V can trap and accelerate electrons to energies approaching several keVs. Trapping acceleration corresponds to conservation of the electron magnetic moment and, thus, results in a significant decrease of the electron equatorial pitch-angle with time. Analytical and numerical estimates of the maximum energy and probability of trapping are presented. We discuss the application of the proposed model in light of recent observations of electromagnetic fluctuations in the inner magnetosphere that are present during periods of strong geomagnetic activity [Chaston et al., GRL, 2014; Califf et al., JGR, 2015].",

It alters the normal patterns of ocean circulation, surface temperature, and evaporation,\ncausing\nnoticeable\nand often\nsevere\nchanges\nin\nweather\nconditions\nin many\nareas\nof the\nworld\n. El Niño is the warm phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and usually reaches its peak between December and February time period.\nEl Niño and its worldwide consequences are studied by the school network of the GLOBE Program (www.globe.gov) which brings together students, teachers, and scientists in support of student research and validation of international Earth science research projects.\nSince the start of the GLOBE Program over 20 years ago, GLOBE classrooms utilize carefully developed daily, weekly, or seasonally protocols such as maximum, minimum and current temperatures, rainfall, soil moisture, and others, to measure changes in the environment. The data collected by the students is entered in an online GLOBE database. In addition to the student-contributed data, automated stations also collect and send measurements to the GLOBE database.\nStudents compare their data with global data acquired by satellites to help validate the satellite data. With a potentially historic-level El Niño event thought to be on the horizon--possibly one of the strongest in 50 years—we will propose an emphasis on measurements from GLOBE schools that will support studies and satellite observations of El Niño. We plan to provide the schools with additional satellite data sets such as ocean temperature measurements from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), sea surface elevation measurements from Jason-2 and 3 (after it launches), and others to be identified.\nWe wish to address and support the following educational objectives:\n- Demonstrate how El Niño affects local precipitation and temperature across the globe,\n- Link teachers, scientists and students to improve understanding of the local effects of El Niño on weather, ecosystems, and society, and compare these effects in different countries,\n- Provide insights to the essential elements of satellite images and their use in identifying physical changes on Earth’s surface,\n- Strengthen scientific reasoning abilities in GLOBE students.",

            "abstract": "The detailed morphology of five submarine mud volcanoes were surveyed using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) developed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Mud volcanoes are constructional features built by extrusion of gas, subsurface fluids and fine-grained sediment. Two surveys covering four submarine mud volcanoes were conducted on the CCGS Sir Wilfred Laurier in the Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic. A survey of one mud volcano was conducted on the Taiwanese Ocean Research V in the South China Sea, SE of Taiwan. The AUV carried a multibeam sonar, a 1-6 kHz chirp sub-bottom profiler, and a110 kHz sidescan, and obtained overlapping multibeam bathymetric coverage at a vertical resolution of 0.15 m with a horizontal footprint of 0.9 m and chirp seismic-reflection profiles with a vertical resolution of 0.11 m. Mud volcanoes were either flat topped or conical. The conical mud volcano off Taiwan had a diameter of ~2 km and 10° side slopes; the conical feature in the Beaufort Sea had a diameter of ~1.5 km and 4° side slopes. The sides of the conical mud volcanoes were smooth, suggesting they were formed by sediment flows that emanate from a vent on their crests. The flanks of the conical mud volcanoes characteristically had very low acoustic reflectivity, but one single high reflectivity trail from the crest of the Beaufort Sea mud volcano indicates a recent flow. Three mud volcanoes in the Beaufort Sea formed circular, flat-topped plateaus that are up to ~1.1 km in diameter and elevated up to 30 m from the surrounding seafloor. The fine scale morphology and reflectivity on these plateaus show low relief, concentric, and ovoid circles that appear to be mud boils probably associated with eruptive events of varying ages at shifting vent sites. The different mud volcano shapes are attributed to variations in the viscosity of the erupting sediment slurries and may represent a sequential morphology, which is altered by shifts in venting position over time.",

            "abstract": "Variability and change in seasonal water storage in the major Arctic-draining watersheds of Eurasia (Ob. Yenisei and Lena) are assessed in several ways using a combination of storage estimates from the NASA GRACE satellite system, gauged runoff and output from the NASA MERRA atmospheric reanalysis. The study is motivated by the pronounced environmental changes observed in the northern high latitudes and recognition of the climatic importance of changes in hydrology both within and beyond the region. Monthly storage changes based on GRACE gravimetric measurements (2002-2015) and from a water balance approach for the same period calculating storage changes as a residual using gauged runoff along with aerologically-determined net precipitation (atmospheric vapor flux convergence minus the time change in atmospheric precipitable water) from MERRA are generally in good agreement. Agreement is also good for calculations in which aerologically-determined net precipitation is replaced with the MERRA forecasts of precipitation and evapotranspiration. On average, the storage in each of the three watersheds examined (the Ob, Yenisei and Lena) peaks in March and is at a minimum in September. However, this seasonal cycle, primarily driven by snowpack storage through autumn and winter, and snowmelt through spring and summer, varies considerably from year to year in amplitude, phase and between the three watersheds in response to variability in precipitation, evapotranspiration, and near surface air temperature. As assessed over the longer period 1979-2015 covered by MERRA, there is evidence that in response to rising air temperatures influencing precipitation phase and snow storage, peak storage has shifted to earlier in the winter. While recent work provides evidence for a link between increased autumn snowfall over Eurasia and reduced autumn sea ice extent that provides for a moisture source, the effect of increased snowfall is not clearly apparent in water storage.",

            "abstract": "Two new generation solid-medium Griggs-type apparatus have been set up at the Laboratoire de Géologie of ENS PARIS, and the Institut des Sciences de la Terre d’Orléans (ISTO). These new set-ups allow to perform controlled rock deformation experiments on large volume samples, up to 5 GPa and 1300°C. Careful pressure – stress calibration will be performed (using D-DIA and/or Paterson-type experiments as standards), strain-stress-pressure will be measured using modern techniques and state of the art salt assemblies.\nFocusing on rheology, the pressure vessel at ISTO has been designed in a goal of deforming large sample diameter (8 mm) at confining pressure of up to 3 GPa. Thanks to this large sample size, this new vessel will allow to explore the microstructures related to the deformation processes occurring at pressures of the deep lithosphere and in subduction zones. In this new apparatus, we moreover included a room below the pressure vessel in order to develop a basal load cell as close as possible to the sample. This new design, in progress, aims at significantly improving the accuracy of stress measurements in the Griggs-type apparatus. The ultimate goal is to set up a new technique able to routinely quantify the rheology of natural rocks between 0.5 and 5 GPa. Although fundamental to document the rheology of the lithosphere, such a technique is still missing in rock mechanics.\nFocusing on the evolution of physical and mechanical properties during mineral phase transformations, the vessel at ENS is equipped with continuous acoustic emission (AE) multi-sensor monitoring in order to “listen” to the sample during deformation. Indeed, these continuous recordings enable to detect regular AE like signals during dynamic crack propagation, as well as non-impulsive signals, which might be instrumental to identify laboratory analogs to non-volcanic tremor and low frequency earthquake signals. P and S elastic wave velocities will also be measured contemporaneously during deformation. Indeed, elastic wave velocities may be a good non-destructive proxy to track mineral reaction extent, under in-situ conditions. Attempts will also be performed to develop a tool to measure P and S wave anisotropy, at least along certain directions. Both data might prove of crucial interest to interpret the latest generation of tomographic imaging.",

A variety of geophysical tools and satellite data are used to monitor volcanic eruptions and to predict the movement of ash.

GPS instruments are frequently deployed near volcanos, but typically they have only been used to measure deformation. Here a method is proposed to detect volcanic plumes using GPS signal to noise ratio (SNR) data.

            "abstract": "Growth of an inner core has conventionally been related to core cooling blow the liquidus of iron. It is however possible that the core of the proto-Earth solidifies upon pressure increase during accretion. The lithostatic pressure in the proto-Earth increases immediately after merging each impactor, and the pressure-dependent liquidus of iron may supersede the temperature near the center resulting in a solid inner core. Assuming that Earth is formed by accreting a few dozen Moon to Mars size planetary embryos, the thermal evolution of the proto-Earth’s core is investigated during accretion. The collision of an embryo heats the Earth differentially and the rotating low-viscosity, differentially heated core stratifies, creating a spherically symmetric stable and radially increasing temperature distribution. Convection occurs in the outer core while heat transfers by conduction in deeper parts. It is assumed that the iron core of an embryo pools at the bottom of partially molten mantle and thermally equilibrates with surroundings. It then descends as an iron diapir in the solid silicate mantle, while releasing its gravitational energy. Depending on its temperature when arrives at the core mantle boundary, it may spread on the core creating a hot layer or plunge into the core and descend to a neutrally buoyant level while further releasing its gravitational energy. A few dozen thermal evolution models of the core are investigates to examine effects of major parameters such as: total number of impacting embryos; partitioning of the gravitational energy released during the descent of the diaper in the mantle (between the silicate mantle and the iron diaper), and in the core (between the proto-Earth’s core and that of the embryo); and gravitational energy and latent heat released due to the core solidification. All of the models predict a large solid inner core, about 1500 to 2000 km in radius, at the end of accretion.",

            "abstract": "The E-W trending South Pyrenean Foreland Basin, formed during the upper Cretaceous and the early Miocene due to the collision between Iberian and European plates, is filled by marine to continental deposits affected by a set of successive southvergent thrusts.\nIn order to constrain the links between fracture development, thermal regime, and fluid flow in the basin, we estimated temperatures of formation and C-O isotope signatures of fracture-filling minerals (veins), maximum paleo-temperatures of sediments, and the timing and orientation of major fracture sets.\nThe isotopic composition of 150 veins and sediment samples has been measured. Peak temperatures of 100 bulk rocks and veins have been estimated, using Raman spectroscopy, vitrinite reflectance, fluid inclusion microthermometry and mass-47 clumped isotopes. The orientation of ~5000 joints and veins has been used to link major tectonic events to fracture development.\nMost primary fluid inclusions show moderate salinities (~2.5 wt%), compatible with connate or evolved meteoric waters. Fluids were generally in thermal and isotopic equilibrium with host sediments, suggesting a low fluid-rock ratio, and thus a limited impact of fractures on fluid-flow.\nPeak temperatures (T max) decrease southward, from ~240°C in Cretaceous to Eocene sediments close to the axial zone, to ~60°C. In a same location dominant compaction joints were mineralized close to T max, ~40°C higher than tectonic shear veins. All fracture orientations were likely controlled by Pyrenean shortening. Genetic relationships between fracture sets are currently under investigation.\nFinally, temperatures of 240°C measured in Eocene sediments cannot be explained by balanced cross sections using geothermal gradient expected in foreland basins (20-25°C/km). 1D thermal modeling is being performed to explain this thermal anomaly, which could result from high heat flow following mid-Cretaceous extension, the ingress of hot fluids, or undocumented tectonic loading.",

            "abstract": "When methane (CH4) is generated in anoxic soil sites, it may be subsequently re-oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2). Understanding the controls on, and magnitudes of, these processes is necessary to accurately represent greenhouse gas production and emission from soils. We used a laboratory incubation to examine the influence of variable conditions on methane transmission and oxidation, and identify critical reaction zones throughout the soil column. Sandy soils were sampled from three different sites at Disney Wilderness Preserve (DWP), Florida, USA: a depression marsh characterized by significant surface organic matter accumulation, a dry pine flatwood site with water intrusion and organic horizon at depth (200+ cm); and an intermediate-drainage site. Contiguous, 30-cm long cores were sampled from N=4 random boreholes at each site, from the surface to the water table (varying from 90 to 240 cm). In the lab, each core was monitored for 50 hours to quantify baseline (pretreatment) gas fluxes before injection with 6 ml CH4 (an amount commensurate with previous field collar measurements) at the base of each core. We then monitored CH4 and CO2 evolution for 100 hours after injection, calculating per-gas and total C evolution. Methane emissions spiked ~10 hours after injection for all cores, peaking at 0.001 µmol/g soil/hr, ~30x larger than pre-injection flux rates. On a C basis, CO2 emissions were orders of magnitude larger, and rose significantly after injection, with elevated rates generally sustained throughout the incubation. Cores from the depression marsh and shallower depths had significantly higher fluxes of both gases. We estimate that 99.1% of the original CH4 injection was oxidized to CO2. These findings suggest either that the methane measured in the field at DWP originates from within a few centimeters of the surface, or that it is produced in much larger quantities deeper in the profile before most is subsequently oxidized. This highlights the need for better understanding and modeling the multiple processes that result in soil-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Regional MODFLOW models commonly use coarse grids which preclude model application to local management issues (e.g., surface-water depletion by wells) without recourse to labor-intensive inset models. The advent of MODFLOW-USG opens the possibility of applying regional models directly to local problems over large areas.\nA “semi-structured” approach (uniform grid within layers, different grids among layers) has been tested using the USGS Lake Michigan Basin (LMB) regional model. The original 20-layer model with uniform 5000-ft spacing was converted to four layers with 500-ft spacing in the top glacial layer (where surface-water features are located) overlying coarser resolution layers representing deeper deposits. The MODFLOW-USG version of the LMB model successfully reproduces regional flow conditions and the refined grid spacing improves the simulated response of surface water to nearby wells. Introduction of streamflow routing increases model power to properly simulate headwater streams.\nThe semi-structured LMB model is designed to feed a decision-support system based on metamodels. A metamodel is a statistical model founded on a computationally-expensive distributed model. In this case three types of metamodels trained on the LMB semi-structured model were tested (artificial neural networks, bayesian networks, and gradient-boosted regression trees) to evaluate the contribution of surface water to wells in shallow groundwater systems. The metamodels show a strong statistical relation between surface-water configuration and stream depletion in the presence of shallow pumping. Two conceptualizations of stream depletion were tested – one related to source of water to wells (“well-centered”), the other to baseflow reduction (“stream-centered”). Both hold promise that the trained metamodels, incorporating existing geospatial data, allow practical decision support across at least part of the US glacial aquifer system.",

            "abstract": "Northeast China has undergone widespread extension and magmatism since Late Cretaceous. There are many Cenozoic volcanoes in this region and a few of them are still active today, such as Changbaishan and Wudalianchi. Previous tomography models show stagnant slabs within the transition zone beneath NE China, and suggest deep slab control on the regional tectonics and volcanism. Proposed mechanisms for the magmatism include: 1) a mantle plume, 2) hot upwelling above the stagnant slab by deep dehydration and 3) upwelling induced by deep slab segmentation and detachment. To date, NE China seismic images still contain enough uncertainty to allow for multiple models. Using the dense seismic data coverage in NE China and adjacent regions our goal is to make high-resolution image of the transition zone and slab structure to test the origins of intraplate volcanism.\nRecently Chen et al. (2015) developed a 3D model for P and S velocity structure beneath East Asia using adjoint tomography using the SPECFEM3D synthetic technique and cross-correlation time shifts as the objective function. We use their model as a starting model and further improve the resolution by fitting waveforms to a shorter period (from ~12s to ~5s) using the correlation coefficient as the objective function. The new objective function is closely related to the L2 waveform misfit but is insensitive to a constant amplitude ratio between the synthetic and data within each time window used. This feature is desirable because the absolute amplitude can be hard to model as it can be affected by many factors difficult to incorporate in simulations, such as site effects, source magnitude and mechanism error or even poor calibration of instruments. During inversion we focus specifically on the transition zone and the structure of slabs with the goal of fitting triplicated and multipath body waves. We have performed a waveform inversion experiment using data from a single deep earthquake. Excellent fits of the triplicated waveforms are achieved after 5 iterations, which show the feasibility of our waveform inversion procedure. Results from an inversion of a large data set will be presented.",

            "abstract": "A mass extinction is defined by a substantial increase in extinction rates, resulting in a loss of biological and ecological diversity. However, a mass extinction’s taxonomic severity does not always correlate with its ecological severity (Droser et al. 2009). Using the fossil record, one can reconstruct the relationships between extinct biota and past environments through extrapolating evidence of an organism’s feeding, tiering, and motility based on its functional morphology and analogies with its extant relatives. We used Bush, Bambach, and Daly’s conceptual model of marine ecospace to study marine modes of life. We looked at the number of different ecological modes over time, and observed that this curve roughly parallels Sepkoski’s generic diversity over time in that the number of ecological modes generally increases over time. Then we measured the selectivity of each mass extinction in log-odds using logistic regression. Here we compiled a “heat map” of the selectivity of 5 major mass extinctions based on the life mode of each marine genus in our dataset. Additionally, we looked at the standard deviation of the log-odds of extinction, which shows how uniform the selectivity of the mass extinction is across all life modes (i.e. a small standard deviation points to a more uniform selectivity among life modes). Ecological diversity was impacted by the mass extinctions: the end-Permian (Changhsingian) mass extinction had less variation in log-odds of extinction, whereas the other mass extinctions had a greater range of standard deviation of the log-odds of extinction. Three of the five mass extinctions (Famennian, Rhaetian, and Maastrichtian) were more ecologically selective than the others (Hirnantian and Changhsingian), which indicate that these two had factors that affected most marine life modes equally. In conclusion, not all mass extinctions had the same ecological effect.",

This presentation provides results of an overview in progress of the continuum of potential applications of climate science organized and coordinated through US CLIVAR. We define applications more broadly than simply ready for operations or direct use, and find that there are several stages in a continuum of readiness for communication and collaboration with communities that use climate information. These stages include: 1) advancing scientific understanding to a readiness for the next research steps aimed at predictable signals; 2) application of understanding climate phenomena in collaboration with a boundary organization, such as NOAA RISAs DOI Climate Science Centers, and USDA Climate Hubs, to understand how predictable signals may be translated into useable products; 3) use of knowledge in risk framing for a decision process, or in a science synthesis, such as the National Climate Assessment, and 4) transitioning new science knowledge into operational products (e.g. R2O), such as intraseasonal climate prediction. In addition, US CLIVAR has sponsored efforts to build science-to-decisions capacity, e.g., the Postdocs Applying Climate Expertise (PACE) program, in its 7th cohort, which has embedded climate experts into decision-making institutions.\n We will spotlight accomplishments of US CLIVAR science that are ripe for application in communities that are managing climate risks -- such as drought outlooks, MJO forecasting, extremes, and ocean conditions -- for agricultural production, water use, and marine ecosystems. We will use these examples to demonstrate the usefulness of an “applications continuum framework” identifying pathways from research to applications.",

            "abstract": "The Queen Charlotte Fault (QCF) is a major plate boundary located off the northwest coast of North America that has produced large earthquakes in 1949 (M8.1) and more recently in October, 2012 (M7.8). The 2012 event was dominated by thrusting despite the fact that plate motions at the boundary are nearly transcurrent. It is now widely believed that the plate boundary comprises the QCF (i.e., a dextral strike-slip fault) as well as an element of subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate. Repeating earthquakes and seismic tremor have been observed in the vicinity of the QCF; providing insight into the spatial and temporal characteristics of repeating earthquakes is the goal of this research. Due to poor station coverage and data quality, traditional methods of locating earthquakes are not applicable to these events. Instead, we have implemented an algorithm to locate local (i.e., < 100 km distance to epicenter) earthquakes using a single, three-component seismogram. This algorithm relies on the P-wave polarization and, through comparison with larger local events in the Geological Survey of Canada catalogue, is shown to yield epicentral locations accurate to within 5-10 km. A total of 24 unique families of repeating earthquakes has been identified, and 4 of these families have been located with high confidence. Their epicenters locate directly on the trace of the QCF and their depths are shallow (i.e., 5-15 km), consistent with the proposed depth of the QCF. Analysis of temporal recurrence leading up to the 2012 M7.8 event reveals a non-random pattern, with an approximately 15 day periodicity. Further analysis is planned to study whether this behaviour persists after the 2012 event and to gain insight into the effects of the 2012 event on the stress field and frictional properties of the plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "Trends of decreasing snowpack and increasing risk of drought are looming challenges for California water resource management. Increasing vulnerability of the state’s natural water supplies threatens California’s social-economic vitality and the health of its freshwater ecosystems. Despite growing awareness of potential climate change impacts, robust management adaptation has been hindered by substantial uncertainty in future climate predictions for the region. Down-scaled global climate model (GCM) projections uniformly suggest future warming of the region, but projections are highly variable with respect to the direction and magnitude of change in regional precipitation. Here we examine the sensitivity of California surface water supplies to climate variation independently of GCMs. We use a statistical approach to construct predictive models of monthly streamflow based on historical climate and river basin features. We then propagate an ensemble of synthetic climate simulations through the models to assess potential streamflow responses to changes in temperature and precipitation in different months and regions of the state. We also consider the range of streamflow change predicted by bias-corrected downscaled GCMs. Our results indicate that the streamflow in the xeric and coastal mountain regions of California is more sensitive to changes in precipitation than temperature, whereas streamflow in the interior mountain region responds strongly to changes in both temperature and precipitation. Mean climate projections for 2025-2075 from GCM ensembles are highly variable, indicating streamflow changes of -50% to +150% relative to baseline (1980-2010) for most months and regions. By quantifying the sensitivity of streamflow to climate change, rather than attempting to predict future hydrologic conditions based on uncertain GCM projections, these results should be more informative to water managers seeking to assess, and potentially reduce, the vulnerability of surface water supplies to climate change in California.",

The horizontal resolution is 28 km over the North Atlantic basin and transitions to 111 km over the rest of the globe. The high-resolution region fully resolves the structure of tropical cyclones and the subsequent transition into extratropical systems. The low-resolution global domain makes this approach computationally efficient compared to traditional uniform high-resolution grids. The transition from warm-core, symmetric tropical cyclones to cold-core, asymmetric extratropical cyclones is quantified using cyclone phase space parameters that represent the symmetry and thermal structure of the cyclone. This phase space analysis is used to evaluate the extratropical transition in CAM-SE and results are compared to reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP CFSR). Extratropical transition occurred in about 63% of tropical cyclones in CAM-SE and 54% in NCEP CFSR, compared 46% in observations using subjective analysis. The seasonal cycle, phase space distribution, and duration of extratropical transition in CAM-SE are comparable to reanalysis data. The results show that the long-term climatology of the extratropical transition of tropical cyclones is successfully simulated in CAM-SE.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic variability can pose a serious threat to the poverty-stricken regions of North Africa. Yet, the current understanding of oceanic versus terrestrial drivers of North African droughts/pluvials is largely model-based, with vast disagreement among models. In order to identify the observed drivers of North African climate and develop a benchmark for model evaluations, the multivariate Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Assessment (GEFA) is applied to observations, remotely sensed data, and reanalysis products.\nThe identified primary oceanic drivers of North African rainfall variability are the Atlantic, tropical Indian, and tropical Pacific Oceans and Mediterranean Sea. During the summer monsoon, positive tropical eastern Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies are associated with a southward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, enhanced ocean evaporation, and greater precipitable water across coastal West Africa, leading to increased West African monsoon (WAM) rainfall and decreased Sahel rainfall. During the short rains, positive SST anomalies in the western tropical Indian Ocean and negative anomalies in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean support greater easterly oceanic flow, evaporation over the western ocean, and moisture advection to East Africa, thereby enhancing rainfall.\nThe sign, magnitude, and timing of observed vegetation forcing on rainfall vary across North Africa. The positive feedback of leaf area index (LAI) on rainfall is greatest during DJF for the Horn of Africa, while it peaks in autumn and is weakest during the summer monsoon for the Sahel. Across the WAM region, a positive LAI anomaly supports an earlier monsoon onset, increased rainfall during the pre-monsoon, and decreased rainfall during the wet season. Through unique mechanisms, positive LAI anomalies favor enhanced transpiration, precipitable water, and rainfall across the Sahel and Horn of Africa, and increased roughness, ascent, and rainfall across the WAM region.\nThe current study represents the first attempt to separate the observed roles of oceanic and vegetation feedbacks across North Africa, and provides observational benchmark for model evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Adsorption of arsenate on clay minerals can control the mobility of As and subsequent contamination of groundwater. While the effect of ionic strength on As adsorption to phyllosilicate minerals has been evaluated for various clay minerals, the specific ionic composition of the surrounding pore water can play a critical role in promoting adsorption (or desorption) of As(V). We conducted a series of isotherms to evaluate the adsorption of As(V) to various phyllosilicates in the presence of monovalent (K+), divalent (Ca2+, Mg2+) and trivalent (La3+) cations while maintaining constant ionic strength and pH. Adsorption isotherms were combined with surface complexation modeling to describe retention mechanisms of As(V) as a function of ionic composition in the surrounding solution. When ionic strength is supplied by higher valency cations, the ions in the surrounding pore water possess higher charger densities. Consequently, these higher valency cations form stronger outer sphere bridging complexes between negatively charged phyllosilicate mineral surfaces and negatively charged arsenate oxyanions. We find that higher valency cations greatly enhance the propensity for As(V) adsorption on phyllosilicate minerals.",

            "abstract": "Proxy evidence indicates that over the last millennium, 'megadroughts' of greater length and severity than observed in the instrumental record have occurred with some frequency. However, the mechanisms for these events are complex and not completely understood: stochastic atmospheric variability, teleconnections from the tropical oceans, and land surface feedbacks all contribute to megadrought initiation and persistence. The NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) Last Millennium Ensemble presents an excellent opportunity for examining the relationship between oceanic variability and drought in a probabilistic framework, as the LME contains 30 separate realizations of the 850-2005 period with varying combinations of external forcing factors. The LME is used to investigate the link between El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability and hydroclimate on both interannual and multidecadal timescales, in several drought-prone regions throughout the world; ENSO is quite strong in the CESM, and its influences on interannual hydroclimate variability are correspondingly large. The ENSO-megadrought link is less straightforward on multidecadal timescales, and the influences of both ENSO and low-frequency oceanic modes on the occurrence of megadrought conditions is examined. Changes to these relationships under 20th century greenhouse warming are also investigated, as well as comparisons with 21st century simulations using the CESM Large Ensemble. Implications for future megadrought risk are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Western Boreal Plains (WBP) landscape is a mosaic of wetlands, lakes, and forested uplands, of which wetlands comprise nearly half. Along wetland-forestland transitions, dynamic ground/surface water interactions can have a strong influence on the quantity and chemistry of runoff to downstream basins. In a region affected by large-scale industrial development, there exists the need to better understand the hydrology of wetland-forestland complexes and their interactions, particularly over the long-term in order to capture inter-year climate variability. Pauciflora Basin (750 masl) is a 43 ha basin comprised of a poor fen bordered by forested uplands located on a prominent topographic high ~40 km SE of Fort McMurray (250 masl). Over the four-year study (April-Sept), the basin received 67% more precipitation (P) per month on average compared to 30-year climate normals and an average of 100 mm more P per season than the nearby regional weather station (360 masl). Wetland-forestland connectivity was highly dynamic both spatially and temporally but typically followed a trend of (1) upland water tables (UWT) sloping towards the wetland during spring and early summer and (2) a steady decline in UWT as the season progressed leading to flow reversals and decoupling. Runoff generation from the catchment was typically greatest in the spring and early summer when wetland and forestlands were coupled. However, runoff remained sensitive to P throughout the season for most years due to frequent rain events in excess of 20 mm d-1. Inter-year variability in storage on UWT appeared to be driven by slope characteristics, and upland runoff to the fen was high when UWT was within the more hydrologically active soil layer, which may influence solute and runoff processes downstream. Headwater catchments with above average P and significant wetland-upland connectivity may represent an important water supply for downstream catchments in an otherwise subhumid climate.",

Improved instrument calibration, redundant sensors, longer flight legs, energy flux estimation and wavelet and filter analysis revealed new gravity wave properties. Over the sea, flight level wave amplitudes mostly fall below our detection threshold. Over terrain, disturbances show characteristic mountain wave attributes of positive vertical energy flux (EFz), negative momentum flux and upwind horizontal energy flux. In some cases, the fluxes change rapidly within an eight hour flight, even though environmental conditions are unchanged, suggesting high sensitivity or auto-oscillation. The extreme EFz=22W/m2.\nMost intriguing is the variety of disturbance scales found over New Zealand. In many cases, the dominant wavelength of the flux carrying mountain waves is long; between 60 and 150km. In the strong cases however, with EFz>4W/m2, the wave “downshifts” to an intermediate wavelength between 20 to 60 km. Two other disturbance scales are seen. In all cases, the vertical wind variance at flight level is dominated by short “fluxless” waves with wavelengths in the 8 to 15km range. These waves propagate upwind but they carry no vertical momentum or energy fluxes. These fluxless waves may be secondary ducted waves riding on the tropopause inversion. In four cases, mountain waves stagnate the wind and turbulent wave breaking is found with a dominant wavelength of 500m.",

We used LiDAR for mapping the extent of the glaciolacustrine sediments and map and characterise landslides in the Pine River valley, near Chetwynd, British Columbia. We included metrics such as travel angle, length, area, and elevation to distinguish rotational and translational landslides. We mapped 45 landslides in the Pine River valley distinguishing between rotational and translational landslides. The rotational landslides commonly have a smaller area and smaller travel length than translational landslides. Most rotational slides involved overlying alluvial fans, while most translational slides involved terraces.",

            "abstract": "Over 1,000 U.S. dams have been removed (1975-2015) for reasons including obsolescence, liability concerns, water quality upgrades, fisheries, or ecosystem enhancements. Contaminated sediment can significantly complicate the approval process, cost, and timeline of a dam removal, or stop it entirely. In a dam removal, reservoir sediment changes from a sink to a source of contaminants. Recently, the Sierra Club sued to stop the removal of a large dam in Ohio because of the potential impact of phosphate releases on toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie.\nHeavy metals, PCBs, PAHs, pesticides, and petroleum hydrocarbons can be present in reservoir sediments. In a non-dam removal scenario, reservoir management tools range from “no action” to dredging, dewatering and removal, or sediment capping. But it is not clear how these reservoir management techniques apply to dam removals. Case studies show typically >80% of the reservoir sediment is eventually eroded, precluding sediment capping as a containment option. However, the released contaminants are diluted by mixing with “clean” sediment and are transported to different physio-chemical environments which may immobilize or biodegrade the contaminants. Poorly understood options include phased drawdown/reseeding the former reservoir to contain sediments, diking contaminant “hot spots,” and addressing contaminant stratigraphy (where historical use created “hot layers” in the reservoir sediment).\nResearch and policy development needs include: (1) assessment methods based on synergistic effects of multiple contaminants being present; (2) ways to translate the pre-removal contaminant concentrations to post-removal health risks downstream; (3) evaluation of management practices for contaminant “hot spots” and “hot layers;” (4) tools to forecast the presence of contaminated sediment using easily accessible information; and (5) ways to limit liability risk for organizations participating in dam removals involving contaminated sediment.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas are responsible for a major component of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Quantification of urban GHG fluxes is important for establishing scientifically sound and cost-effective policies for mitigating GHGs. Discrepancies between observations and model simulations of GHGs suggest uncharacterized sources in urban environments. In this work, we analyze and quantify fluxes of CO2, CH4, CO (and other trace species) from the Baltimore-Washington area based on the mass balance approach using the two-aircraft observations conducted in February-March 2015. Estimated fluxes from this area were 110,000±20,000 moles s-1 for CO2, 700±330 moles s-1 for CH4, and 535±188 moles s-1 for CO. This implies that methane is responsible for ~20% of the climate forcing from these cities. Point sources of CO2 from four regional power plants and one point source of CH4 from a landfill were identified and the emissions from these point sources were quantified based on the aircraft observation and compared to the emission inventory data. Methane fluxes from the Washington area were larger than from the Baltimore area, indicating a larger leakage rate in the Washington area. The ethane-to-methane ratios, with a mean of 3.3%, in the limited canister samples collected during the flights indicate that natural gas leaks and the upwind oil and natural gas operations are responsible for a substantial fraction of the CH4 flux. These observations will be compared to models using Ensemble Kalman Filter Assimilation techniques.",

            "abstract": "We dissociated methane hydrates by stepwise depressurization. The initial hydrates were formed by injecting gas into a cylindrical sample of brine-saturated, coarse-grained sand at hydrate-stable conditions with the intention of reaching three-phase equilibrium. The sample was initially at 1°C with a pore pressure of 1775 psi and a salinity of 7 wt. % NaBr. The depressurization setup consisted of one pump filled with tap water attached to the confining fluid port and a second pump attached to the inlet port where the methane was injected. Depressurization was conducted over sixteen hours at a constant temperature of 1°C. The pore pressure was stepwise reduced from 1775 psi to atmospheric pressure by pulling known volumes of gas from the sample. After each extraction, we recorded the instantaneous and equilibrium pore pressure. 0.503 moles of methane were removed from the sample. The pore pressure decreased smoothly and nonlinearly with the cumulative gas withdrawn from the sample. We interpret that hydrate began to dissociate immediately with depressurization, and it continued to dissociate when the pressure decreased below the three-phase pressure for 1°C and 0 wt. % salinity. Two breaks in slope in the pressure vs. mass extracted data are bounded by smooth, nonlinear curves with differing slopes on either side. We attribute the breaks to dissociation of three zones of hydrate concentration. We created a box model to simulate the experimental behavior. For a 10% initial gas saturation (estimated from the hydrate formation experiment and based on mass conservation), an initial hydrate saturation of 55% is required to match the total methane extracted from the sample. Future experiments will be conducted over a longer timespan while monitoring hydrate dissociation with CT imaging throughout the process.",

            "abstract": "Investigators have searched for evidence of tidal triggering of earthquakes for decades because triggering behavior provides potentially valuable information about the stress conditions on faults and how earthquake nucleate. Earth tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon which induce periodic stresses with two important components related to the rotation of the Earth relative to the sun and moon (semi-diurnal 12 and ~12.4 hours) and the orbit of the moon around the Earth (fortnightly, ~14.7 days). Semi-diurnal tidal stresses have previously been shown to trigger low frequency earthquakes (LFEs) and non-volcanic tremors (NVTs) on the San Andreas Fault. LFEs and NVTs occur within the brittle-ductile transition of the Earth’s crust, deeper than where regular earthquakes occur. Here we show that tidal stresses trigger earthquakes in the brittle upper crust, which is caused by and detectable due to interactions between the semi-diurnal and fortnightly stress cycles. The triggering of LFEs and NVTs are correlated with tidal shear stresses indicating a low coefficient of friction on the deep San Andreas Fault. In contrast, we find that regular earthquakes are correlated with tidal normal stresses indicating a high coefficient of friction in the shallow San Andreas Fault. That earthquakes are triggered during peak normal (extensional) tidal stresses suggests that pore pressures are below lithostatic pressure in the upper crust. These findings suggests tidal triggering can be applied to infer crustal stress state and pore pressure conditions, two properties of faults that are difficult to measure but are important for understanding earthquake physics and seismic hazards.",

            "abstract": "East Coast winter storms can have a broad range of impacts on densely populated regions of eastern North America. These systems can pose threats to health and safety, significantly disrupt transportation infrastructure, and result in long-term national and global economic consequences. While considerable efforts have been made in the short-term forecasting of these storms, less investigation has detailed their representation in free-running climate simulations at seasonal to multi-year timescales, in part due to the relatively low resolution of traditional global general circulation models (GCMs). However, aspects of these systems determining local impacts include mesoscale storm dynamics, orography, and land surface properties, which require higher horizontal resolution for increased realism. Recently, variable-resolution GCMs have become more widely used as a method of targeting computing resources to regionally increase resolution while maintaining a global modeling framework. These techniques allow for the elimination of boundary conditions and the more physically consistent treatment of subgrid parameterizations.\nIn this presentation we assess the impact of model resolution on winter storm characteristics by using a hierarchy of variable-resolution Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) simulations. Regional refinement is added within CAM over the eastern portions of North America. An automated detection scheme has been developed to objectively find and track storms in output data. In addition, implementation of precipitation type and snow liquid water equivalent algorithms allow for simulated snow, freezing rain, sleet, and mixed precipitation to be assessed in a climatological sense. We pay particular attention to changes in storm intensity and shifts in precipitation distribution as horizontal resolution is increased from typical GCM grid spacings (1°, ~110 km) to resolutions more typical of numerical weather prediction (0.125°, ~14km). Novel methods for analyzing discrete storm events will be discussed. We address the scale sensitivity of parameterizations important in the formation and evolution of these storms and suggest pathways forward for improving regional climate assessments using next-generation numerical techniques.",

In response to calls for improved monitoring and research on the energy and water budgets of the lakes, there has been a growing ensemble of in situ measurements - including offshore eddy flux towers, buoy-based sensors, and vessel-based platforms -deployed through an ongoing, bi-national collaboration known as the Great Lakes Evaporation Network (GLEN). The objective of GLEN is to reduce uncertainty in Great Lakes seasonal and 6-month water level forecasts, as well as climate change projections of the surface energy balance and water level fluctuations. Although It remains challenging to quantify and scale energy budgets and fluxes over such large water bodies, this presentation will report on recent successes in three areas: First, in estimating evaporation rates over each of the Great Lakes; Second, defining evaporation variability among the lakes, especially in winter and; Third, explaining the interaction between ice cover, water temperature, and evaporation across a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Research gaps remain, particularly those related to spatial variability and scaling of turbulent fluxes, so the presentation will also describe how this will be addressed with enhanced instrument and platform arrays.",

            "abstract": "We describe angular variations of energetic ion and electron intensities measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle instruments on Voyager 1 in the very local interstellar medium, and for context, at Voyager 2 in the heliosheath. We emphasize measurements made in 2014-2015. At Voyager 1, now at 132 AU and 11 AU beyond the heliopause, intensities of low-energy ions and electrons and of anomalous cosmic rays remain at background levels. Galactic cosmic ray ions continue to show small departures from isotropy, with broad (0.3-0.5 year) episodes of intensity depletions of ions gyrating nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field. Percentage intensity decreases during these depletions, relative to intensities of cosmic rays propagating along the field, peak at -7% in 2013.35, -3% in 2014.50, and at least -4% in 2015.60 (when the most recent data were examined). Two episodes in March-April 2013 and April-May 2014 when cosmic ray ion intensities showed small increases lasting 10-20 days indicate small energy boosts, produced possibly by magnetic disturbances from solar activity entering the interstellar medium [Gurnett et al., Ap. J. 2015]. During these two periods intensities of cosmic rays with pitch angles nearer 90 degrees were increased more than those with pitch angles nearer 0 and 180 degrees. At Voyager 2, now 24 AU beyond the termination shock, intensities of ions >30 keV and electrons >20 keV continue to recover in a step-like fashion from minima reached in early 2013. We reported previously that during the rapid initial recovery from these minima as particle intensities rose at Voyager 2, angular data for ions 30 keV to 30 MeV (i.e., including anomalous cosmic rays) showed strong and long lasting (about 4 months) net streaming away from the heliospheric nose toward the flank. A similar streaming episode lasting about 2 months occurred in early 2015, again during a period when intensities were rapidly increasing.",

Scientists are using various approaches to evaluate the rarity, severity, and causes of this drought. This talk describes one approach to evaluating the influences of various causal factors. Using a framework for generating a superensemble of regional climate simulations called climateprediction.net, created by scientists at University of Oxford, we have generated tens of thousands of simulations of the period November 2013 to May 2015, to focus on the most acute period of drought in these three states. One set used observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), one used average SSTs from 2000-2010, and one “natural” set used the observed SSTs but with the anthropogenic warming component subtracted and greenhouse gas concentrations set to pre-industrial values. Within the three sets, the simulations differ only in the atmospheric initial conditions used. Distinctly different likelihoods of drought emerge in the Pacific states in the three sets of simulations. This talk will describe differences in temperature, precipitation, snow water equivalent, atmospheric flow, and energy and water balance terms in the various sets of simulations, and how they differ from California to Washington.

For dating of geological material using the K‐Ar system, the simultaneous determination of 40Ar and 40K concentrations on the same aliquot is not possible. Therefore, a widely used variant, the 40Ar/39Ar technique, involves the production of 39Ar from 39K by neutron bombardment and the reliance on indirect natural calibrators of the neutron flux, referred to as “mineral standards.” Many mineral standards still in use rely on decades‐old determinations of 40Ar concentrations; resulting uncertainties, both systematic and analytical, impede the determination of higher accuracy ages using the K‐Ar decay system. We present results for the 40Ar concentrations and ages of mineral standards determined based on a modern gas delivery system (Morgan et al. 2011), which delivers metrologically-traceable amounts of 40Ar and thus allows for the sensitivity calibration of noble gas mass spectrometers.",

            "abstract": "Foreshock bubbles (FBs), transient ion foreshock phenomena formed from highly concentrated suprathermal foreshock ions upstream of solar wind discontinuities, produce intense disturbances in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system and can accelerate particles to even higher energies. Rotational discontinuities are known to drive FBs. Tangential discontinuities (TDs), however, have no normal magnetic field component, prohibiting access of field-aligned particles upstream. Thus, they have not been previously considered as drivers of FBs. However, given that suprathermal foreshock ions have gyroradii larger than the width of TDs, they may pass upstream of TDs and generate FBs. Using multi-point observations from Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), we report on two cases of TD-driven FBs identified by using classical FB selection criteria. We applied multi-point THEMIS observations on TD-driven FBs to study their spatial structures and time evolutions. We also statistically studied the formation condition of TD-driven FBs. Our results add another potential solar wind driver of FBs and imply that FBs may be even more common than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "Relativistic (E > 0.6, > 2.0, and > 4.0 MeV) electrons at geosynchronous orbit during solar cycle 23 are well-correlated with the intervals of high-intensity, long-duration, continuous AE activity (HILDCAA) events. Cluster-4 passes were examined for electromagnetic chorus waves in the 5 < L < 10 and 0 < MLT < 12 region. All the HILDCAA events under study were found to be characterized by enhanced whistler-mode chorus waves and flux enhancements of magnetospheric relativistic electrons of all three energies compared to the pre-event flux levels. CIR magnetic storms followed by HILDCAA events show almost the same relativistic electron signatures. It is concluded that the CIR storms have little to do with the acceleration of relativistic electrons. The response of the energetic electrons to HILDCAAs was found to vary with solar cycle phase. The initial electron fluxes were lower for events occurring during the ascending and solar maximum (AMAX) phases than for events occurring during the descending and solar minimum (DMIN) phases. The flux increases for the DMIN-phase events were > 50% larger than for the AMAX-phase events. It is concluded that electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies most often and most efficiently during the DMIN-phases of the solar cycle. Enhanced E > 0.6 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit were first detected ~1 day after the statistical onset of HILDCAAs, E > 2.0 MeV electrons after ~1.5 days, and E > 4.0 MeV electrons after ~2.5 days. It is proposed that relativistic electrons are bootstrapped from high energy electrons: the E > 0.6 MeV electrons are accelerated from HILDCAA-injected E ~100 keV electrons, the E > 2.0 MeV electrons from the E > 0.6 MeV electron population, and consequently the E > 4.0 MeV electrons are accelerated from the E > 2.0 MeV population, etc. Relativistic electron acceleration and decay timescales will be provided for wave-particle investigators to attempt to match their models to empirically derived values.",

            "abstract": "Mountain forest composition and distribution is strongly affected by temperature and is expected to shift to higher elevations with climate change. However, warmer winters will also lead to an upward shift of the snowline and a decrease in snowpack at lower and intermediate elevations. In the mountain ranges of Western North America, snowpack plays an important role in providing additional moisture during the dry summer months. It is therefore unclear if the projected climate change will lead to a rise of subalpine forest due to a longer growing season or a contraction due to drought stress. Since forest succession processes take place over decades and centuries we use LandClim, a dynamic vegetation model, to assess the impact of climate change on mountain forests on the Olympic Peninsula (Washington, USA). As a reality check we first simulate vegetation dynamics since the last Ice Age and compare model output with paleobotanical data from five natural archives that span the topographic and climatic gradients on the Peninsula. LandClim produces realistic present-day species compositions with respect to elevation and precipitation gradients. Moreover, the simulations of forest dynamics for the last 16,000 years generally agree with the pollen and macrofossil data. We then simulated mountain forests under future climate projections. As a result, our model indicates drastic changes in species composition with a replacement of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) by more drought-resistant species such as subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). On the drier, eastern side of the Peninsula, the model even suggests a lowering of timberline due to insufficient moisture availability in shallow alpine soils. Our results have important implications for ecosystem managers and stress the urgency of climate change mitigation.",

It is therefore a critical parameter in the water-food-energy nexus. The stream temperature is affected by both climatic conditions and human activities such as reservoir and power plant operations. This study adopts a physically based stream temperature model within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. The Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) has been developed to represent riverine water dynamics and incorporated into CESM by coupling with the Community Land Model (CLM). Here we build upon CLM-MOSART to represent the riverine transport of heat along with water flux and the energy exchanges between river water and the atmosphere. The impacts of reservoir and power plant operations are also explicitly incorporated with this stream temperature model. Scenarios of climate change effects as well as climate change combined with human activities are simulated. Trend in stream temperature, especially summer stream, will be systematically analyzed. Discussions of how future stream temperature affects energy production and food security will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Fluid induced stress perturbations in the crust at seismogenic depths can be caused by various sources, such as deglaciation unloading, magmatic intrusion or fluid injection and withdrawal. Numbers of studies have robustly shown their link to earthquake triggering. However, the role of small periodic stress variations induced by solid earth and oceanic tides or seasonal hydrology in the seismic cycle, of the order of a few kPa, remains unclear. Indeed, the existence or absence of correlation between these loading phenomena and earthquakes has been equally proposed in the literature.\nTo investigate this question, we performed a set of triaxial deformation experiments on water-saturated Fontainebleau and Bentheim sandstones, 7% and 20% porous respectively. Rock samples were loaded by the combined action of steps of constant stress (creep), intended to simulate tectonic loading and small sinusoidal pore pressure variations with a range of amplitudes, analogous to tides or seasonal loading. All tests were conducted at a regulated temperature of 35°C and a constant 35 MPa confining pressure. Our experimental results show that (1) pore pressure oscillations do not seem to influence the deformation rate at which the rock fails, (2) they correlate with acoustic emissions. Even more interestingly, we observe a progressive increase of the correlation coefficient in time as the rock approaches failure. The correlation coefficient is also sensitive to the amplitude of pore pressure oscillations as larger oscillations produce higher correlation levels. Finally, we show that, in the last hours of creep before failure, acoustic emissions occur significantly more when the pore pressure is at its lowest.\nThis suggests that the correlation of small stress perturbations and acoustic emissions depend on the state stress of a rock and the amplitude of the perturbations and that emissions occur more likely when cracks are unclamped. In other words, our observations suggests that tidal triggering might occur favorably during the long nucleation phase of earthquake, as recently suggested for both Sumatra and Tohoku.",

            "abstract": "We summarize the evidence for lower crust horizontal detachment, and discuss where and when it occurs. Relative motion between the crust and upper mantle requires: temperatures hot enough for a very weak lower crust; a driving force, especially high elevation and continent or terrane collision; and a low resistance place for the upper crust to move into, especially a weak foreland thrust belt. It has recently been recognized that most subduction zones have wide well-defined backarc regions with uniformly high temperatures. The temperatures are high enough for a very weak lower crust and we conclude that backarcs are the main areas with the potential for detachment. For North America, the current or thermally-recent hot backarc includes most of the Cordillera. Detachment is common in backarcs based on: (1) Lower crust temperature estimates of 800-900C and laboratory data that indicate a very weak lower crust at such temperatures, 10x18-10x19 Pa s, even lower if some partial melt. In contrast, cratons are cold and strong, 400-500C at the Moho, greater than 10x21 Pa s. (2) Lower crust horizontal seismic reflectors interpreted to indicate current or past horizontal shear, (3) Structural and tectonic evidence that appears to require lower crustal detachment, especially long-distance strain transfer through the upper crust. (4) Outcrop sections of former lower crust that exhibit strong horizontal shearing fabric at over 800C. Large scale structural and tectonic interpretations need to allow for common upper crust transport and deformation in current and former backarcs, independent of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen fixation, the primary source of new nitrogen (N) to tropical forests, is exclusively catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme, which almost always requires molybdenum (Mo). Increasing evidence in recent years suggests that Mo availability may be low in highly weathered soils and can constrain N-fixation rates. Mo is generally either present in a highly soluble form (MoO42-) that is susceptible to leaching or tightly bound in minerals unavailable for biological uptake. To address how Mo is retained in highly weathered tropical systems to support N-fixation, atmospheric transport through dust and sea-salt aerosol spray were examined. Using a global atmospheric transport model computed from modeled meteorological fields, extrapolated dust and sea-salt aerosol Mo sources were used to calculate global distribution of Mo deposition. Dust deposition occurs across the entirety of some tropical forests, particularly the world’s largest tropical forest in the Amazon Basin. The model indicates that the Amazon Basin receives substantial inputs of dust, especially the entire northern Amazon Basin, while the southern half receives less. Most of the dust reaching the Amazon originates from the Sahara Desert, and about half of this dust originates from one part of the Sahara, the Bodélé Depression. Mo in dust from the Bodélé Depression was measured with an average concentration of 1.14 ± 0.05 µg/g, similar to the crustal abundance. The model predicts Mo inputs from sea-salt aerosols in coastal regions up to 0.002 mg m-2yr-1. Significant sea-salt deposition occurs up to 300 km inland. Mo from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning were also evaluated to determine the potential influence of anthropogenic emissions on releasing Mo into the environment.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics influences the global climate and carbon cycle. Continental arrangement affects Earth’s albedo, and rates of plate motion control heat flux from the interior and rate of volcanic degassing. While rates of Phanerozoic plate movements and magnetic field reversals have been well studied, little is known about these phenomena in Earth’s early tectonic history due to a paucity of unaltered Archean rocks retaining primary magnetization. Archean tectonics and an active geodynamo would have played an important role in creating environments suitable for life. A magnetostratigraphic study integrated with high-precision geochronology has the potential to quantify plate velocities and magnetic field reversal rates.\nThe 2.7 Ga Fortescue Group on the Pilbara craton in Western Australia is one of the oldest and best-preserved basalt successions. The Fortescue records two intervals of potentially rapid cratonic motion, but velocity estimates ranging from 4–50 cm/yr suffer from current ages’ analytical errors on the order of a few Ma. We measured five stratigraphic sections across these intervals, and collected paleomagnetic and geochronology samples at known stratigraphic heights. With our calculated virtual geomagnetic poles and U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS zircon ages with precision and accuracy of <1 Ma, we can more precisely quantify the velocity of the Pilbara craton as it underwent a ~10,000 km displacement during the eruptive history of the group’s lowest stratigraphic unit, the Mount Roe Basalt, and a more modest displacement of ~2000 km during the deposition of the Tumbiana Formation and Maddina Basalt. We also observe and constrain the age of a previously undescribed magnetic field reversal in the Tumbiana Formation, doubling the described magnetic field reversal rate to four reversals over the 60 Ma depositional history of the Fortescue. Our calculated plate velocities will enlighten the debate on the role of tectonics in the cooling of early Earth.",

While ASCII based data formats have positive aspects, such as the ease of accessing the data from disk and the wide variety of tools available for data analysis, there are some drawbacks, especially when viewing the situation through the lens of data interoperability and stewardship.\nThe Unidata data translation tool, Rosetta, is a web-based service that provides an easy, wizard-based interface for data collectors to transform their datalogger generated ASCII output into Climate and Forecast (CF) compliant netCDF files following the CF-1.6 discrete sampling geometries. These files are complete with metadata describing what data are contained in the file, the instruments used to collect the data, and other critical information that otherwise may be lost in one of many README files. The choice of the machine readable netCDF data format and data model, coupled with the CF conventions, ensures long-term preservation and interoperability, and that future users will have enough information to responsibly use the data. However, with the understanding that the observational community appreciates the ease of use of ASCII files, methods for transforming the netCDF back into a CSV or spreadsheet format are also built-in.\nOne benefit of translating ASCII data into a machine readable format that follows open community-driven standards is that they are instantly able to take advantage of data services provided by the many open-source data server tools, such as the THREDDS Data Server (TDS). While Rosetta is currently a stand-alone service, this talk will also highlight efforts to couple Rosetta with the TDS, thus allowing self-publishing of thoroughly documented datasets by the data producers themselves.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical and soil investigations of the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory (RCCZO) have revealed that the depth to unweathered bedrock is deeper on north facing than on south facing slopes. This asymmetry has been posited to be a function of greater soil moisture in the north facing aspects. The increased moisture input leads to higher rates of weathering and thus to deeper unweathered bedrock. However, how this asymmetry changes from the higher elevations to the lower elevations has not been examined in the RCCZO. To examine the catchment wide weathering trends, seismic refraction tomography (SRT) surveys will be conducted in Johnston Draw along the lines shown in Figure 1. Johnston Draw is a 1.5 km2 east-west trending granitic catchment that ranges from 1400 m to 1900 m in elevation in the semi-arid Owyhee Range of southwest Idaho. The site has been instrumented with meteorological instruments on its north and south slopes. Because of its uniform lithology, easterly drainage direction, range of elevations, and instrumentation, it is a unique site for exploring aspect controlled weathering asymmetry. SRT provides a 2D profile of P-wave velocity from which the depth to unweathered bedrock can be inferred by the depth to the velocity of fresh bedrock which is about 4km/s at this site. Observations of snow accumulations and plant communities in Johnston Draw suggest that at the top of the draw the difference in the soil moisture between the south and north facing slopes is greater than at its bottom. Thus it is hypothesized that the difference between the rate of weathering of the north and south facing aspects will be greater at the top of the draw and this will be reflected in a greater asymmetry in weathering depths. This is diagramed in Figure 2 in which the blue arrows depict qualitatively the hydraulic flux and the vegetation the changes in ground cover through the catchment. A previous SRT survey conducted near the top of Johnston Draw by the WyCHEG group showed that significant north-south slope weathering depth asymmetry was present. Our SRT lines will spaced at progressively lower elevations down in the catchment (Figure 1). This work will enable us to examine how the weathering depths change from the higher elevations at the top of the draw to the lower elevations at the bottom of the draw.",

The droplet number concentration values are retrieved from surface radiometer measurements of cloud optical depth from the multi-filter rotating shadow-band radiometer (MFRSR) and liquid water path from the microwave radiometer (MWR). We validate the NDROP VAP with in situ aircraft measurements from the Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer probe during the long-term aircraft field campaign, Routine ARM Aerial Facility (AAF) CLOWD Optical Radiative Observations (RACORO). The NDROP VAP considers entrainment effects rather than assuming an adiabatic cloud, which improves the values of the NDROP VAP by reducing the magnitude of cloud-droplet number concentration. The NDROP VAP captures the primary mode of in situ measured droplet number concentration, but produces too wide a distribution due to too frequent high cloud-droplet number concentrations. The large droplet number concentration error corresponds to errors in the MWR retrievals at low liquid water paths due to the limitations of the instrument. Modification of the NDROP VAP through the diagnosed liquid water path, which is constrained by the coordinated solution using cloud optical depth and cloud-droplet effective radius retrievals, alleviates this problem, leading to better agreement with in situ measurements.",

The SORTIE mission is being developed by a team including ASTRA (lead institution), AFRL, University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), COSMIAC (Satellite Integrator), and Boston College. SORTIE will address cutting-edge science in the area of ionospheric dynamics.\nThe SORTIE mission will address the following science questions:\nQ1) Discover the sources of wave-like plasma perturbations in the F-region ionosphere.\nQ2) Determine the relative role of dynamo action and more direct mechanical forcing in the formation of wave-like plasma perturbations. To address these questions we plan to fly a CubeSat with novel sensors that measure key plasma parameters in a circular, low to middle inclination orbit near 350-400 km altitude. The sensors include an ion velocity meter (built by UTD) and a Planar Langmuir Probe (built by AFRL). The SORTIE mission plan is to describe the distribution of wave-like structures in the plasma density of the ionospheric F-region. In doing so, the SORTIE team will determine the possible role of these perturbations in aiding the growth of plasma instabilities. SORTIE will provide (1) the initial spectrum of wave perturbations which are the starting point for the RT calculation; (2) measured electric fields which determine the magnitude of the instability growth rate near the region where plasma bubbles are generated; (3) initial observations of irregularities in plasma density which result from RT growth. SORTIE results will be used as input to PBMOD, an assimilative first-principles physical model of the ionosphere, in order to predict evolution of EPBs.\nIn this presentation, we will review the science objectives, provide an overview of the spacecraft and instrument design, and present a concept of operations plan.",

The constrained global gravity spectrum (magenta) is determined to about n=900, whereas the Bouguer spectrum is accurate to about n=600. The correlation with gravity derived from constant density topography in the second figure shows that the high-order coefficients (n>700) are improved significantly over the previous degree 1200 field.

            "abstract": "During large X-class flares the Earth’s upper atmospheric E-region responds immediately to solar photons in the 1 to 7 nm range. The response can change the E-region density by factors approaching 10, create large changes in conductivity, and plague HF communications. GOES-XRS provide 0.1 to 0.8 nm and a 0.05 to 0.4 nm integral channels; SOHO-SEM provided a 0 to 50 nm irradiance; TIMED and SORCE-XPS diode measurements also integrated down to 0.1 nm; and most recently SDO-EVE provided a 0.1 to 7 nm irradiance. For atmospheric response to solar flares the cadence is also crucial. Both GOES and SDO provided integral measurements at 10 seconds or better. Unfortunately these measurements have failed to capture the 1 to 7 nm spectral changes that occur during flares. It is these spectral changes that create the major impact since the ionization cross-section of the dominant atmospheric species, N2 and O2, both contain step function changes in the cross-sections.\nModels of the solar irradiance over this critical wavelength regime have suffered from the need to model the spectral variability based on incomplete measurements. The most sophisticated empirical model FISM [Chamberlin et al., 2008] used 1 nm spectral binning and various implementations of the above integral measurements to describe the 1 to 7 nm irradiance. Since excellent solar observations exist at other wavelengths it is possible to construct an empirical model of the solar atmosphere and then use this model to infer the spectral distribution at wavelengths below 5 nm. This differential emission measure approach has been used successfully in other contexts [e.g., Warren, 2005, Chamberlin et al., 2009].\nThis paper contrasts the broadband versus spectrally resolved descriptions of the incoming irradiance that affects the upper atmospheric E-layer. The results provide a prescription of what wavelength resolution would be needed to adequately measure the incoming solar irradiance in the 1 to 7 nm range.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, it has been shown that gravity waves generated by earthquakes and tsunamis can reach the upper atmosphere, where they can have a measureable effect on the ionosphere. Observations made with networks of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers as well as airglow imaging systems have been used to study the properties of these waves through the signatures they leave in the electron density and airglow layers, respectively. Using the Naval Research Laboratory first-principles model, SAMI3, coupled to a model of the tsunami-generated gravity waves, it has been suggested that in addition to generating perturbations in the ionospheric electron density, the neutral winds associated with the gravity waves should produce perturbations in the electric field. These electric field perturbations would map along the Earth’s magnetic field where they would drive disturbances in the ionosphere, generating a signature in the conjugate hemisphere. We present GPS-derived total electron content data from several tsunami events demonstrating that this effect is, indeed, measurable. Being able to observe the effects of tsunami-generated gravity waves in the conjugate hemisphere increases the number of observations that can be used to study this ion-neutral coupling phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "Low cloud physics are especially critical to climate and modern climate model projections. Explicit representation of low clouds in a global atmospheric model is achieved by pushing the computational limits of cloud superparameterization to resolve boundary-layer eddy scales relevant to marine stratocumulus (250m horizontal and 20 m vertical length scales). We call this extreme configuration “ultraparameterization”. Pilot test results from hindcast experiments will be shown, validated against top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation daily observations (CERES) and, against YOTC reanalyses during the VOCALS period. We demonstrate promising model behaviors and interesting sensitivities. The new computational challenges of running an ultraparameterized CAM at the GPU-accelerated petascale for explicit low cloud feedback science application will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Microscopic mobility of atoms in minerals controls macroscopic metamorphic and tectonic processes in Earth's crust. Deformation and diffusion, each an expression of this mobility, are both processes of breaking and reforming bonds and take energy to proceed. Deformation can facilitate diffusion by supplying strain energy that facilitates breaking bonds and enhance diffusion rates by mobilizing dislocations, which localize atomic migration. Deformation-enhanced diffusion may therefore lower closure temperatures for geochronometers and thermobarometers. If the effect of deformation on diffusion is measurable, we must reevaluate these tools for deformed rocks. We explore this effect and its potential as the basis for estimating duration and rate of strain in the rock record. We focus on feldspar, a rheologically and modally dominant mineral in Earth’s crust for which deformation and diffusion parameters are well known. Different elements have different diffusion rates within each mineral, which are differentially accelerated by a deformation-induced reduction of their activation energies for diffusion. We present the first comprehensive study of strain enhancement of diffusion in plagioclase, a combination of km-scale, thin-section-scale, and grain-scale strain and chemical measurements for major and trace elements in naturally deformed plagioclase phenocrysts from the San José Pluton, Peninsular Ranges Batholith, México. Our samples had low initial compositional contrasts and experienced low strain. Under these conditions, the effect of strain-enhanced element mobility, as predicted from our model, is below analytical detection limits. For these rocks, a static diffusion model is sufficient, and thermobarometers and geochronometers can still be applied to yield accurate results.",

For each 1/8 grid, we derived statistics of single-event storm duration, total accumulated precipitation, and dry period between each storm events during cold (Oct-Mar) seasons, and histogram of event-by-event statistics are used to estimate the thresholds for extreme (below-1%) and very extreme (below-0.1%) events. In this way, we constructed unique climatology maps of the extreme precipitation-drought frequencies and probability density functions. This climatology map depicted that cold-season extremely heavy precipitation events are populated over West Coast, Deep South, and coastal zone of North East, suggesting impacts of land-falling maritime storm systems. Simultaneously, datasets depicts that long-extended precipitation events are mostly populated over North West, and lower Mississippi Basin up to North East centered at Appalachian Mountains, resembling east Pacific storm tracks and nor’easter storm tracks, respectively.\nFurthermore, season-by-season statistics of these extreme events were examined for each National Climate Assessment (NCA) regimes in comparison with a number of major atmospheric oscillations and teleconnection patterns as well as Arctic Amplifications. Index of Arctic Amplification includes variability of 500mb zonal wind speed and pole-to-midlatitude differences in atmospheric thickness, linking to the phase speed of the Rossby wave. Finally, we present ensemble correlations scores, and discuss the physical processes and underlying mechanisms for their key characteristics as well as the predictive skill and predictability of the extreme events from sub-seasonal to interannual scales during cold seasons.",

            "abstract": "Based on the historical forecasts of three quasi-operational multi-model ensemble (MME) systems, this study assesses the superiorities of the coupled MME over its contributing single-model ensembles (SMEs) and over the uncoupled atmospheric MME in predicting the seasonal variability of the Western North Pacific-East Asian summer monsoon. The seasonal prediction skill of the monsoon is measured by Brier skill score (BSS) in the sense of probabilistic forecast as well as by anomaly correlation (AC) in the sense of deterministic forecast. The probabilistic forecast skill of the MME is found to be always significantly better than that of each participating SME, while the deterministic forecast skill of the MME is even worse than that of some SME. The BSS is composed of reliability and resolution, two attributes characterizing probabilistic forecast skill. The probabilistic skill increase of the MME is dominated by the drastic improvement in reliability, while resolution is not always improved, similar to AC. A monotonous resolution-AC relationship is further found and qualitatively understood, whereas little relationship can be identified between reliability and AC. It is argued that the MME’s success in improving the reliability possibly arises from an effective reduction of biases and overconfidence in forecast distributions. The coupled MME is much more skillful than the uncoupled atmospheric MME forced by persisted sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. This advantage is mainly attributed to its better capability in capturing the evolution of the underlying seasonal SST anomaly.",

The evaluation has been completed for Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Ozone Mapper/Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir instruments. Since launch, the SDS has also been processing, archiving and distributing data from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Ozone Mapper/Profiler Suite (OMPS) Limb instruments and this work is planned to continue through the life of the mission. As NASA transitions to the production of standard, Earth Observing System (EOS)-like science products for all instruments aboard Suomi NPP, the Suomi NPP Science Team (ST) will need data processing and production facilities to produce the new science products they develop. The five Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS): Land, Ocean. Atmosphere, Ozone, and Sounder will produce the NASA SNPP standard Level 1, Level 2, and global Level 3 products and provide the products to the NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) for distribution to the user community. The SIPS will ingest EOS compatible Level 0 data from EOS Data Operations System (EDOS) for their data processing. A key feature is the use of Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) services for the continuous EOS-SNPP satellite data record.  This allows users to use the same tools and interfaces on SNPP as they would on the entire NASA Earth Science data collection in EOSDIS.",

            "abstract": "Numerical modeling was performed to quantitatively study the influences of various factors on submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in a coastal aquifer. Tide and terrestrial hydraulic gradient are the important forces driving fresh and salt water movement in a coastal aquifer. Unlike steady-state flow, dynamic fresh and salt water mixing at near-shore seafloor could form an intertidal mixing zone (IMZ) near the surface. Based on the construction of a general SGD model, the effects of various model components such as boundary conditions, model geometry and hydraulic parameters on SGD were systematically studied. Several important findings were obtained from the study results. (1) Previous studies indicated that a freshwater discharge tube could be formed between classic transition zone and IMZ. However, this phenomenon might become unclear with the increase of heterogeneity and anisotropy of the medium’s conductivity field. (2) SGD and IMZ were both more sensitive to the vertical anisotropy ratio of hydraulic conductivity (Kx/Kz) than to the horizontal anisotropy ratio of hydraulic conductivity (Kx/ Ky). (3) Heterogeneity of effective porosity significant affected SGD and IMZ. (4) Increase of storage coefficient decreased fresh water discharge while increased mixing salt water discharge and total SGD increases. The increase would also change the shape of the IMZ. (5) Variation of dispersivities had little influence on SGD, but would significantly change the distributions of the IMZ and the whole mixing zone. These findings will be helpful to the field study of SGD on sampling design and the application of dynamic SGD model to field sites for model development and calibration.",

            "abstract": "We have reviewed available visual information from the seafloor, and recently acquired microbathymetry for several traverses across the Lucky Strike segment to evaluate the distribution of hydrothermal activity. The Lucky Strike segment hosts three active hydrothermal fields: Capelinhos, Ewan, and the known Main Lucky Strike Hydrothermal Field (MLSHF). Capelinhos is located 1.3 km E of the axis and the MLSHF, and consists of a ~20 m sulfide mound with black smoker vents. Ewan is located ~1.8 km south from the MLSHF along the axial graben, and displays only diffuse flow along and around scarps of collapse structures associated with fault scarps. At the MLSHF we have identified an inactive site, thus broadening the extent of this field.\nHeat flux estimates from these new sites are relatively low and correspond to ~10% of the heat flux estimated for the Main field, with an integrated heatflux of 200-1200 MW. Overall, most of the flux (up to 80-90%) is associated with diffuse outflow, with the Ewan site showing solely diffuse flow and Capelinhos mostly focused flow.\nMicrobathymetry also reveals a large, off-axis (~2.4 km) hydrothermal field, similar to the TAG mound in size, on the flanks of a rifted volcano. The association of these fields to a central volcano, and the absence of indicators of hydrothermal activity along the ridge segment, suggest that sustained hydrothermal activity is maintained by the enhanced melt supply and the associated magma chamber(s) required to build central volcanoes. Hydrothermal outflow zones at the seafloor are systematically controlled by faults, indicating that hydrothermal circulation in the shallow crust exploits permeable fault zones. Central volcanoes are thus associated with long-lived hydrothermal activity, and these sites may play a major role in the distribution and biogeography of vent communities.",

            "abstract": "Distinctive set of arcuate, reddish-colored lineaments has been identified on Tethys. These markings are slightly darker than adjacent cratered terrains but have a flatter green–IR spectral slope. There are at least three prominent sets in the northern hemisphere centered on the anti-Saturn meridian. Each set consists of ~5–10 parallel lineations a few kilometers across and 50–250 km long. The lineations are remarkably curvilinear (i.e., non-sinuous) and not deflected by major impact structures: they cross uninterrupted the floor of 400-km-diameter, 10-km-deep Odysseus impact basin. In one area (~25° N, 185°W), high-resolution mapping at ~90–125 m/pixel shows no discrete scarp, ridge, or other tectonic manifestation along the feature. Instead, only a faint discoloration and ~25 small dark spots 200–800 m in diameter have been identified. These spots are characterized by very low albedos, sharp boundaries, and no evidence of raised rims expected with impact origin. Of these, ~60% (15) are at the bottom of small craters. The IR lineaments show remarkable symmetry centered on the tidal axis with Saturn. Exogenic mechansims are ruled out by geometry and geology, hence we explore possible endogenic origins. Stress mechanisms being tested include non-synchronous rotation (considered unlikely for a cold, triaxial body like Tethys), tidal recession and true polar wander. The lack of obvious tectonic deformation despite the strong color signature is unusual (although structures may exist below the current resolution limit). Though unlikely, the lineaments could be reactivated ancient fractures, producing a temporal discoloration. If tectonic, the lineaments might be still forming, with deformation only on a scale below that which we can resolve. The coloration, global pattern and collocated dark spots are consistent with recent/active alteration of the surface, given that E-ring accumulation is expected to remove intrinsic color signatures in a geologically short time period. Low-volume but persistent outgassing/deposition of volatiles from the interior, the colors of which are distinct from the evolved surface and/or result from exposure to space, may be responsible. High-resolution color and IR mapping is planned for November.",

Because of its long period (~28 months), multi-decadal reanalyses are useful in providing a complete, global description of the QBO structure. We examine the QBO using 35 years (1980-2015) of meteorological fields, including ozone, produced by the new, ongoing, NASA MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application) reanalysis system, along with the original MERRA system. The assimilation of new data types (such as limb scanning observations, for example), in addition to the retuning of parameterized gravity wave drag (GWD) in MERRA-2 changes the momentum balance and mean circulations associated with the QBO. Results show that increasing tropical GWD forcing in MERRA-2 led to smaller zonal wind analysis increments associated with the QBO, while both MERRA-2 and MERRA have similar resolved wave QBO forcing in the lower stratosphere. The MERRA-2 dynamics generates a realistic, descending QBO associated mean meridional circulation. Ozone results show the largest amplitude ozone QBO signal near the ozone peak at 10 hPa with a secondary peak in the lower stratosphere. When limb scanning ozone observations become available (starting in 2004) in MERRA-2, the descending ozone QBO becomes better defined. While the MERRA-2 QBO is influenced by changes in the input observations over time, many dynamical structures and ozone features are shown to be consistent throughout the reanalysis period.",

            "abstract": "The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) program offers high resolution estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) in several small basins across California during the melt season. Primarily, water managers use this information to model snowmelt runoff into reservoirs. Another, and potentially more impactful, use of ASO SWE measurements is in validating and improving satellite-based SWE estimates which can be used in austere regions with no ground-based snow or water measurements, such as Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush. Using the entire ASO dataset to date (2013-2015) which is mostly from the Upper Tuolumne basin, but also includes measurements from 2015 in the Kings, Rush Creek, Merced, and Mammoth Lakes basins, we compare ASO measurements to those from a SWE reconstruction method. Briefly, SWE reconstruction involves downscaling energy balance forcings to compute potential melt energy, then using satellite-derived estimates of fractional snow covered area (fSCA) to estimate snow melt from potential melt. The snowpack can then be built in reverse, given a remotely-sensed date of snow disappearance (fSCA=0). Our model has improvements over previous iterations in that it: uses the full energy balance (compared to a modified degree-day) approach, models bulk and surface snow temperatures, accounts for ephemeral snow, and uses a remotely-sensed snow albedo adjusted for impurities. To check that ASO provides accurate snow measurements, we compare fSCA derived from ASO snow depth at 3 m resolution with fSCA from a spectral unmixing algorithm for LandSAT at 30 m, and from binary SCA estimates from Geoeye at 0.5 m from supervised classification. To conclude, we document how our reconstruction model has evolved over the years and provide specific examples where improvements have been made using ASO and other verification sources.",

            "abstract": "In high winds, direct measurements of air-sea fluxes are extremely challenging, and as a result there exist relatively few observationally-based estimates of surface momentum and enthalpy transfer between the air and water. Constraining the corresponding flux coefficients for use in numerical models is paramount to obtaining accurate tropical cyclone forecasts, while their dependence on various physical phenomena such as waves and sea spray remain unresolved. In this work, we use the flux profile technique to estimate surface enthalpy fluxes from dropsonde data spanning 37 different storms, in a manner similar to that used to obtain surface momentum fluxes in previous studies. In particular, we test the robustness of this method using a series of Monte-Carlo-based uncertainty quantification techniques, where uncertain inputs such as the sea surface temperature are varied stochastically. In addition, “virtual dropsonde” profiles extracted from high-resolution large eddy simulations of an idealized tropical cyclone are used to further validate this method for obtaining surface enthalpy fluxes, since all inputs and surface flux parameterizations are known exactly. We conclude that while the flux profile method provides values squarely in the range of previous estimates reported in the literature, these values are only reliable with an error of roughly 100%, particularly at high wind speeds. The causes of this variability and its implications will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The 1,200-km-long Kuril subduction zone is one of the most seismically active regions on the Earth. It was the last major subduction zone totally unexplored by methods of space geodesy. The Kuril GPS Array was installed in summer 2006. Several months later, a doublet of great (MW > 8) earthquakes ruptured the central segment of the Kuril arc where events of such size had not occurred for about a century. We test mechanisms of viscoelastic relaxation with both Maxwell and power-law rheologies to explain the postseismic motion for 8 years following the earthquake doublet. For the period after summer 2007, we have assumed that the contributions from afterslip are negligible. We model viscoelastic relaxation caused by coseismic slip using the open-source software package RELAX of S. Barbot. It allows us to consider the three-dimensional rheology, including a dipping elastic slab and a low-viscosity mantle above the slab. In 2007–2008, the observed postseismic movement was at a speed of several tens of millimeters per year and directed trenchward. Seven years later, the speed was reduced by an order of magnitude and still directed trenchward. Viscoelastic relaxation with the Maxwell viscosity of about 1 × 1018 Pa s reasonably explains the observed deformation for initial 3–5 years with a tendency to an increase in apparent viscosity. However, the question arises: will the apparent viscosity continue to grow with post-earthquake time? A power-law rheology would predict such growth over the decades following an earthquake. According to laboratory experiments, a power-law rheology of olivine is associated with dislocation creep (stress exponent n = 3.4–4.5) or diffusional creep (n = 0.9–1.5). We modeled deformation for a range of values of n and of apparent initial viscosity. We found the power-law models that agree well with the observed postseismic deformation, showing a significantly better fit in later years (2012–2015) than a Maxwell rheology with viscosity 1 × 1018 Pa s.",

            "abstract": "Directly observing basin-mean precipitation in the high-elevation basins of the Sierra Nevada of California is challenging, due to the sparse network of precipitation gauges at these altitudes and due to snow undercatch errors. However, numerous observations of streamflow and snowpack are also made in the Sierra, which offer additional information about the water balance of the basin with which to estimate precipitation.\nWe develop and apply a Bayesian methodology for inferring basin-mean precipitation from streamflow and snowpack observations, in multiple snow-dominated Sierra basins. To do this, we calibrate semi-lumped hydrologic models representing each basin, using streamflow and snowpack to infer multiplicative corrections to precipitation forcing data, and thus improve basin-mean precipitation estimates. We use unimpaired streamflow observations from multiple basins across the Sierra from the mid-20th century to the present, as well as snowpack observations combined from snow pillows, courses and airborne LIDAR observations (ASO).\nFor each basin, mean precipitation is inferred both as a long-term average and for individual water years. We investigate the inferred spatial patterns of precipitation in comparison to standard climatological and daily gridded precipitation datasets, finding significant differences in some basins and in some water years. For example, see figure of different estimates of 1982-2006 mean annual precipitation for several Yosemite-area basins (figure from manuscript currently in review at Water Resources Research). We also investigate the precision and robustness of inferring basin-mean precipitation rates from streamflow and snowpack observations. Uncertainties in this approach are associated with uncertainties in lumped hydrologic model structure and in the methodology of translating point snow observations to the basin scale. Using both snowpack and streamflow observations in the inference likely reduces these uncertainties, relative to using streamflow or snow alone.\nBased on this work, we hypothesize that the addition of streamflow and snowpack observations to standard approaches of distributing precipitation would improve their accuracy in areas of high-elevation, complex terrain.",

The CRTM has been applied to UV and visible sensors, infrared and microwave sensors. The paper will demonstrate the applications of the CRTM, in particular radiative transfer in the retrieva algorithm. The NOAA Unique CrIS/ATMS Processing System (NUCAPS) operationally generates vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature (AVTP) and moisture (AVMP) from Suomi NPP Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) measurements. Current operational CrIS data have reduced spectral resolution: 1.25 cm-1 for a middle wave band and 2.5 cm-1 for a short-wave wave band [1]. The reduced spectral data largely degraded the retrieval accuracy of trace gases. CrIS full spectral data are also available now which have single spectral resolution of 0.625 cm-1 for all of the three bands: long-wave band, middle wave band, and short-wave band. The CrIS full-spectral resolution data is critical to the retrieval of trace gases such as O3, CO [2], CO2, and CH4. In this paper, we use the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) to study the impact of the CrIS spectral resolution on the retrieval accuracy of trace gases. The newly released CRTM version 2.2.1 can simulates Hamming-apodized CrIS radiance of a full-spectral resolution. We developed a small utility that can convert the CRTM simulated radiance to un-apodized radiance. The latter has better spectral information which can be helpful to the retrievals of the trace gases. The retrievals will be validated using both NWP model data as well as the data collected during AEROSE expeditions [4]. We will also discuss the sensitivity on trace gases between apodized and un-apodized radiances.\n",

            "abstract": "Back-projection has been proven to be reliable and effective for unraveling complicated earthquake rupture processes. It is very robust because the method makes few a priori assumptions about the fault geometry or rupture speed, and is relatively insensitive to 3D velocity variations. As most studies use array data at high frequencies for back-projection imaging, the results sometime suffer from artifacts, limited resolution, and unclear physical explanations. We have found that improved back-projection results can be obtained utilizing global data. First, global data often can provide fairly uniform azimuthal coverage, which improves spatial resolution and reduces back-projection artifacts, permitting hidden features in the ruptures to be studied in detail. Second, the good azimuthal coverage also enables back-projection to be performed at relatively low frequencies (0.05 to 0.2 Hz), which can fill in the gap between moment tensor/finite-fault inversions (low frequency content) and high-frequency back-projection/beam-forming. Third, P-wave polarity differences among global stations will affect the maximum coherency of back-projected power as a function of source location, which can be used to resolve the spatially varying focal-mechanisms of complicated earthquakes involving multiple fault segments. We plan to conduct synthetic tests to explore the resolution and uncertainty limits of global back-projection across multiple frequency bands. Ultimately, we hope to extend the potential of back-projection methods with global array data, while exploring the theoretical limits of the method.",

However, the limitations of these precipitation estimates to produce reliable flood forecasts at multiple scales are not well-understood. Here is presented a data analysis framework to support the scientific and practical question of applicability of space-based rainfall products for global flood forecasting given the limits of space-time resolution and considerable uncertainty of these products. The authors used the hydro-meteorological data collected during the IFloodS campaign in Iowa between May and June 2013 to perform hydrologic simulation using two different rainfall-runoff model structures and five different precipitation products, two radar-based (Stage IV and IFC) and three satellite-based (PERSIANN-CCS, TMPA-RV and CMORPH 1.0). The framework allows studying hydrologic discrepancies at several spatio-temporal scales: spatially by considering all the sub-basins on a given catchment, and temporally by changing dynamically the temporal window of analysis. We use the framework to study discrepancies in rainfall accumulation and peak flow estimates resulting from using different rainfall products as external forcing to a hydrological model, with the well-established Stage IV radar product taken as a reference for comparison.",

Recent studies suggest that in forested watersheds, groundwater influences on water temperature can be inferred by air-water temperature regression models. The goal of this research is to identify landscape attributes that predict groundwater influence at the stream reach spatial scale. We examined estimates of groundwater influence at 81 sites within nine watersheds in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA, over two summers (2012-2013) and determined effects of varying groundwater contribution on thermal sensitivity (extent to which stream temperature changes with unit change in air temperature). We used a GIS to derive a series of landscape factors based upon gradients in geomorphic, geological, and network topology parameters to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater influence on thermal sensitivity during baseflow summer months. We found that groundwater thermal influence was patchy, varying as much within as among watersheds, and that spatial variation in groundwater contribution is influenced by complex interactions among landscape attributes. Moreover, although groundwater influence was relatively consistent among summers at most sites, it changed dramatically at others. There are indications that recent (within one year) precipitation patterns are strongly influencing these transient groundwater sites.",

Current findings suggest that organics and other surfactants in cloud droplets can affect the rate at which water condenses onto and evaporates from droplets. Varying the concentrations and properties of surfactants in individual droplets may alter the sign and magnitude of these rates, which are necessary to understand in order to accurately represent the microphysical properties of clouds in models. Surfactants extracted from atmospheric aerosol particles can considerably reduce the surface tension of water, making them important factors in cloud droplet growth that were until recently considered to be negligible. The concentrations and composition of surfactants and their abilities to depress surface tension varies in atmospheric samples. Using anthropogenic and biological surfactants extracted from atmospheric samples and other compounds with similar compositions, we create model cloud droplets in the laboratory. We built an aerosol optical trap combined with Raman spectroscopy to hold and study the evaporation of water from individual cloud droplets. In this study, we have observed competing effects of surfactants in single water droplets, both reducing the surface tension of the overall droplet allowing water to condense onto the droplets and also creating a coating or barrier that impedes evaporation.",

Instead, Insar and aftershock studies showed soon after the the quake that the southward rupture of the HFT was confined to the subsurface and stopped on the order of 50 km north of the trace of the HFT. We conducted a brief field survey along the active Himalayan Frontal Thrust and along faults and lineaments within the Kathmandu Valley in the fortnight after the earthquake. Our field survey likewise illustrates the lack of surface rupture along the HFT as well as mapped faults and lineaments in Kathmandu Valley. Significant disturbance of the ground surface was limited to a ~1 km long NE trending fracture set in the district of Kausaltar within Kathmandu and interpreted to be the result of localized extension along a ridge, and not the result of deep-seated tectonic displacement. The observations allow that slip on the remaining shallow and southward 50 km section of the HFT is 1) ultimately recovered by post seismic creep, 2) will be accommodated by an earthquake limited to the shallowest southern section of the fault, or 3) that rupture of the southern section will await the occurrence of a yet larger earthquake that slips along the entire decollement. The conundrum serves here as context to present and discuss the interpretation of past and ongoing paleoseismic investigations along the Himalayan arc.",

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing techniques and lava flow forecasting models have been combined to allow an ensemble response during effusive crises at poorly monitored volcanoes. Here, we use the HOTSAT volcano hot spot detection system that works with satellite thermal infrared data and the MAGFLOW lava flow emplacement model that considers the way in which effusion rate changes during an eruption, to forecast lava flow hazards during the 2014–2015 Fogo eruption. In many ways this was one of the major effusive eruption crises of recent years, since the lava flows actually invaded populated areas. HOTSAT is used to promptly analyze MODIS and SEVIRI data to output hot spot location, lava thermal flux, and effusion rate estimation. We use this output to drive the MAGFLOW simulations of lava flow paths and to update continuously flow simulations. Satellite-derived TADR estimates can be obtained in real time and lava flow simulations of several days of eruption can be calculated in a few minutes, thus making such a combined approach of paramount importance to provide timely forecasts of the areas that a lava flow could possibly inundate. In addition, such forecasting scenarios can be continuously updated in response to changes in the eruptive activity as detected by satellite imagery. We also show how Landsat-8 OLI and EO-1 ALI images complement the field observations for tracking the flow front position through time, and add considerable data on lava flow advancement to validate the results of numerical simulations. Our results thus demonstrate how the combination of satellite remote sensing and lava flow modeling can be effectively used during eruptive crises to produce realistic lava flow hazard scenarios and for assisting local authorities in making decisions during a volcanic eruption.",

            "abstract": "Marine aerosols play an important role in controlling the Earth’s radiation balance, cloud formation and microphysical properties, and the chemistry of the marine atmosphere. As aerosol effects on climate are estimated from the difference between model simulations with present-day and with preindustrial aerosol and precursor emissions, accurate knowledge of size‐ and composition‐dependent production flux of sea spray particles is important for correct assessment of the role of anthropogenic aerosols in climate change. One particular knowledge gap in sea spray particle emissions resides in yet uncharacterized contributions of sea spray to the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budget over the marine boundary layer. The chemical composition of 50 to 200 nm sized sea spray particles, most critical to modeling CCN concentration from size distribution data is often simplified as purely organic, purely sea-salt or mixture of both. The lack of accurate information of the size‐dependent production flux of sub-micron sea spray particles prevents the modeling community from resolving discrepancies between model-predicted and measured CCN number concentration in the marine boundary layer.\nWe designed a new system for size-selected sea spray aerosol flux measurement that is composed of a 3D sonic anemometer, two thermodenuders, three differential mobility analyzers, two condensation particle counters, and a CCN counter. The system is designed to operate in both Eddy Covariance (EC) and Relaxed Eddy Accumulation (REA) modes. The system is based on the volatility/humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer technique and is therefore designed to measure the size-resolved turbulent fluxes of sub-micron sized sea-salt particles for a wide range of meteorological, hydrological and ocean chemical/biological conditions. The method and the setup will be presented along with some results from a recent field-deployment of the instrument at the North Carolina coast. This presentation will also show some laboratory results for the anemometer wind corrections using a custom built “ship-simulator” and a motion correction package.",

Shimmering fluids are evident in the ROV video during the deployment and recovery of the thermistors indicating that the area is a diffuse venting zone.\nThe temperature variability can be a result of heterogeneity in the degree of diffuse venting and/or variability in the degree of mixing with the cool ambient waters. Concurrent observations from the NEPTUNE cabled observatory are: temperature from a nearby hot fluid (330 deg) vent orifice that is weakly modulated by the surface tide (pressure), temperature from a diffuse flow area artificially sheltered from the ambient currents and measurements of currents from a bottom-mounted ADCP. We use these measurements to argue that the temperature variability is the result of interaction of the buoyant flow with the oceanic currents in the boundary layer at the level of the faunal assemblage.",

            "abstract": "We investigate dynamic-wave triggered slip under laboratory shear conditions. The experiment is comprised of a 3-block system containing two gouge layers composed of glass beads and held in place by a fixed load in a bi-axial configuration. When the system is sheared under steady state conditions at loads from 3-8 MPa, stick-slip exhibiting a characteristic recurrence time is observed. Under these load conditions, we find that shear failure may be instantaneously triggered by a brief dynamical wave if the system is in a critical shear-stress state, near failure. Dynamic triggering is only observed when the dynamic wave amplitude exceeds strains of 10^(-7). Following triggering, the gouge material remains in an unstable state for long periods of time as manifest by unique slip characteristics not observed during spontaneous events: the measured physical characteristics—the gouge material strength recovery, the gouge layer thickness, the gouge shear modulus and the stick-slip recurrence time recover over many stick-slip cycles following triggering. This work suggests that faults must be critically stressed to trigger under dynamic conditions and that the recovery process following a dynamically triggered event differs from the recovery following a spontaneous event.",

            "abstract": "Growing world-wide demand for uranium (U) as an energy source has raised concerns of the human and ecological risks of U extraction and processing in the United States. Because of limited information on the relationship between U speciation and bioavailability, particularly in aquatic animals, we are characterizing U uptake by a model freshwater invertebrate (the snail Lymnaea stagnalis). This species grazes on biofilms and is thus key in the trophic transfer of contaminants through aquatic food webs. We determined the bioavailability of dissolved U(VI) over a range of water hardness, pH (6 to 8), and the presence of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) as a competing ligand, to test the effect of aqueous speciation on uptake. Bioavailability was assessed using U uptake rate constants (kuw) derived from a kinetic bioaccumulation model. Dissolved U (1 to 1000 nM) was bioavailable over the range of geochemical conditions tested with kuw (L/g/d) decreasing with increasing dissolved Ca and with increasing pH. For example, kuw decreased from 1.6 to 0.3 as dissolved Ca was increased from 0.04 to 1.5 mM, suggesting competition between bioavailable U(VI) species and strong ternary calcium uranyl carbonato complexes. At pH 7.5 in synthetic moderately hard freshwater, kuw decreased from 0.22 in the absence of NOM to 0.07 in the presence of a hydrophobic acid NOM isolate of high aromaticity (SUVA = 5) consistent with strong aqueous complexation of U(VI) by the NOM. The co-variance of U uptake and aqueous U species distribution is being analyzed to determine which U species are bioavailable. U speciation in systems with NOM is calculated using conditional U-NOM binding constants derived by equilibrium dialysis ligand exchange methodology. The bioavailability of dietborne U is being tested since dietary metal uptake prevails for many aquatic species. These experiments include addition of ferrihydrite with U sorbed, both in the presence and absence of NOM, and mixed with diet.",

We show that between 4.75 and 8 Saturn radii H2O+ ions dominate the water group species, and from 8 to 10 Saturn radii it is OH+ ions that dominate. Our results show that the relative proportion of H3O+ falls fastest with increasing distance, while the proportion of H2O+ decreases slowly. However O+ and OH+ increase with distance and O+ is the least dominant ion species out to 8 Saturn radii outside of which it is comparable to H3O+. The relative abundance of H2O+ found here matches theoretical work based on Herschel telescopic data very well. These results are compared with other published work and further improvements to the technique are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Earth System Models (ESMs) are used to estimate terrestrial feedbacks to climate change, such as the permafrost-carbon feedback. Fully characterizing the range of possible future behavior given uncertainty in model structure and parameterization is computationally expensive. Because current ESMs typically employ land models with non-interacting gridcells, there is an opportunity for computational speedup by simulating a subset of the gridcells that are representative of the full model grid. Here, we use a reduced-order modeling technique Gappy Principle Orthogonal Decomposition with Empirical Interpolation (GPOD-EIP) to demonstrate the feasibility of efficiently characterizing the range of future responses to climate. We analyze 31 variable-configuration simulations in the Community Land Model 4.5 (CLM4.5) with GPOD-EIP and create a 20-element POD basis representing the characteristic spatial patterns of soil carbon concentration along with a representative subset of 20 to 100 of the original 20975 gridcells. We train GPOD-EIP with 10 of the 31 simulations chosen adaptively, and reconstruct the time-varying soil carbon distribution in the remaining simulations with a relative error of less than 1%. Highly-variable quantities such as the latent heat flux require a much larger basis and gridcell subset for accurate reconstruction, although their global-mean can be represented more readily. We demonstrate the use of GPOD-EIP in uncertainty quantification by efficiently characterizing the dependence of future carbon feedback on the explicit depth-dependence of soil carbon decomposition, interpolating between the extreme cases investigated in a recent published analysis. We conclude that GPOD-EIP represents a promising reduced-order modeling technique for ESM land-model data and other applications where gridded spatial fields need to be efficiently emulated.",

Isotope mass balance method was used to separate and quantify different runoff component in the Heihe watershed on the Loess Plateau of China. Event-based precipitation samples, monthly-based groundwater samples, and runoff samples for non-flood and flood season were collected to analyze the isotopic compositions. After investigating the feasibility of using mass balance method for hydrograph separation, the contributions of precipitation and groundwater to runoff were quantified for flood and non-flood season and for different reaches of the river. Results showed that the isotopic compositions of precipitation had obvious seasonal variation, and the values in the first half year (-5.75‰) were greater than those in the second half year (-11.10‰); however, the isotopic compositions of groundwater were relatively constant (-10.3±0.6‰). The characterisics of the isotopc compositions of precipitation and groundwater made the mass balance equation feasible for hydrograph separaton. The contributions of precipitation and groundwater to runoff had obvious spatiotmeporal variations. During June, the contributions were both about 50% for the upper reach while they were 20% and 80% for the lower reach, respectively. During August, the contributions were 67% and 33% for the upper reach while they were 43% and 57% for the lower reach, respectively. Runoff in the upper reach was mianly from precipitation, while that in the lower reach was mainly from groundwater. Different measures should be taken to manage the water resoureces of different reach.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive study of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) drainage basin was carried out to improve understanding of the coastal freshwater discharge (FWD) and surface mass balance (SMB) of glaciers. Coastal FWD and SMB for all glacier surfaces were modeled using a suite of physically based, spatially distributed weather, energy-balance snow/ice melt, soil water balance, and runoff routing models at a high resolution (1 km horizontal grid; daily time step). A 35 year hind cast was performed, providing complete records of precipitation, runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE) depth, evapotranspiration, coastal FWD and glacier SMB. Meteorological forcing was provided by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) datasets. A fourth dataset was created by bias-correcting the NARR data to recently-developed monthly weather grids based on PRISM climatologies (NARR-BC). Each weather dataset and model combination was individually calibrated using PRISM climatologies, streamflow, and glacier mass balance measurements from four locations in the study domain. Simulated mean annual FWD into the GOA ranged from 600 km3 yr-1 using NARR to 850 km3 yr-1 from NARR-BC. The CFSR-forced simulations with optimized model parameters produced a simulated regional water storage that compared favorably to data from the NASA/DLR Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) high resolution mascon solutions (Figure). Glacier runoff, taken as the sum of rainfall, snow and ice melt occurring on glacier surfaces, ranged from 260 km3 yr-1 from MERRA to 400 km3 yr-1 from NARR-BC, approximately one half of the signal from both glaciers and surrounding terrain. The large contribution from non-glacier surfaces to the seasonal water balance is likely not being fully removed from GRACE solutions aimed at isolating the glacier signal alone. We will discuss methods to use our simulations to forward-model the hydrology of the Gulf of Alaska region and minimize uncertainty in the partitioning of the hydrological signal. This study provides significant insight into the linkages between hydrological modeling and gravimetric measurements in mountain environments.",

Suomi NPP carries CrIS/ATMS that were designed as follow-ons to AIRS/AMSU. Our objective is to generate a long term climate data set of products derived from CrIS/ATMS to serve as a continuation of the AIRS/AMSU products. The Goddard DISC has generated AIRS/AMSU retrieval products, extending from September 2002 through real time, using the AIRS Science Team Version-6 retrieval algorithm. Level-3 gridded monthly mean values of these products, generated using AIRS Version-6, form a state of the art multi-year set of Climate Data Records (CDRs), which is expected to continue through 2022 and possibly beyond, as the AIRS instrument is extremely stable. The goal of this research is to develop and implement a CrIS/ATMS retrieval system to generate CDRs that are compatible with, and are of comparable quality to, those generated operationally using AIRS/AMSU data. The AIRS Science Team has made considerable improvements in AIRS Science Team retrieval methodology and is working on the development of an improved AIRS Science Team Version-7 retrieval methodology to be used to reprocess all AIRS data in the relatively near future. Research is underway by Dr. Susskind and co-workers at the NASA GSFC Sounder Research Team (SRT) towards the finalization of the AIRS Version-7 retrieval algorithm, the current version of which is called SRT AIRS Version-6.22. Dr. Susskind and co-workers have developed analogous retrieval methodology for analysis of CrIS/ATMS data, called SRT CrIS Version-6.22. Results will be presented that show that AIRS and CrIS products derived using a common further improved retrieval algorithm agree closely with each other and are both superior to AIRS Version 6. The goal of the AIRS Science Team is to continue to improve both AIRS and CrIS retrieval products and then use the improved retrieval methodology for the processing of past and future of AIRS data as well as the processing of past and future CrIS/ATMS data for the purpose of generating consistent CDRs.",

Therefore, understanding the numerous factors that influence winter precipitation variability is a key component in water resource planning. This project examines the effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on winter precipitation in the Cascades using the WRF-ARW regional climate model. WRF simulations were for two ten-member ensembles, one for positive PDO Decembers, and one for negative PDO Decembers. WRF output was compared to both station and gridded observational data. Results indicate that elevations greater than 1000 m receive decreased total precipitation under the negative PDO, while elevations below 500 m receive increased total precipitation. A significant element of this work was evaluating the many options that WRF-ARW provides for representing sub-grid scale cloud microphysical processes. Because the “best” choice of microphysics parameterization can vary depending on the application, this project also seeks to determine which option leads to the most accurate simulation of winter precipitation (as compared to observations) in the complex terrain of the Pacific Northwest. As RCMs tend to do, WRF over-predicts mean total precipitation compared to observations, but the double-moment microphysics schemes over-predict to a lesser extent than the single-moment scheme.",

Velocities are modeled through stacked cross correlations of ambient noise data. Twelve months of continuous data were used from 22 OBS stations and ~30 coastal and island Southern California Seismic Network stations. Particular attention has been paid to improving signal-to-noise ratios in the noise correlations with OBS stations by removing the effects of instrument tilt and infragravity waves. Different applications of preprocessing techniques allow us to distinguish the fundamental and first higher order Rayleigh modes, especially in deep water OBS pairs where the water layer dominates crustal sensitivity of the fundamental mode. Standard time domain and frequency domain methods are used to examine surface wave dispersion curves for group and phase velocities between 5 and 50 second periods, and these are inverted for 3D velocity structure. The results define the transition in three dimensions from continental lithospheric structure in the near-shore region to oceanic structure west of the continental borderland. While the most prominent features of the model relate to thinning of the crust west of the Patton Escarpment, other notable anomalies are present north-to-south throughout the continental borderland and along the coast from the Los Angeles Basin to the Peninsular Ranges. The velocity model will help describe the region's tectonic history, as well as provide new constraints for determination of earthquake relocations and rupture styles.",

This northwest trending zone of discontinuous active faults and disrupted topography that sits between the Sierra Nevada on the west and the north-northeast trending faults and ranges of the Great Basin to the east is associated with a geodetically well-defined zone of northwest-directed right-lateral shear ranging from ~ 5 to 10 mm/yr. It is the northern section of the Walker lane that includes the Lake Tahoe, Carson, Smith, Mason, Antelope, Bridgeport and Walker Lake basins and Carson and Wabuska structural lineaments that is currently the focus of our investigation. Here, right-lateral shear strain of at least 20-30 km has resulted in the development of this set of roughly en echelon normal fault basins in the absence of any major northwest-directed strike-slip faults. Synthesis of available geologic and geodetic data also shows that geodetic deformation is outpacing the late Quaternary slip rate on active faults across the region. The observations may be explained as the result of inadequate geologic fault slip rate data, by the accommodation of slip by vertical-axis block rotations, or some measure of both. The research presented here describes our initial efforts and findings resulting from collection and analysis of Lidar for evidence of strike-slip along the major structures of the region, the application of cosmogenic, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating to identified offset surfaces to better quantify the rate at which faults are slipping in the region, and the collection of gravity and paleomagnetic observations to clarify both the current and long-term structural development of the basins and intervening fault blocks.",

            "abstract": "Displacement of one fluid by another in porous media occurs in various settings including hydrocarbon recovery, CO2 storage and water purification. When the invading fluid is of lower viscosity than the resident fluid, the displacement front is subject to a Saffman-Taylor instability and is unstable to transverse perturbations. These instabilities can grow, leading to fingering of the invading fluid.\nNumerical simulation of viscous fingering is challenging. The physics is controlled by a complex interplay of viscous and diffusive forces and it is necessary to ensure physical diffusion dominates numerical diffusion to obtain converged solutions. This typically requires the use of high mesh resolution and high order numerical methods. This is computationally expensive. We demonstrate here the use of a novel control volume - finite element (CVFE) method along with dynamic unstructured mesh adaptivity to simulate viscous fingering with higher accuracy and lower computational cost than conventional methods. Our CVFE method employs a discontinuous representation for both pressure and velocity, allowing the use of smaller control volumes (CVs). This yields higher resolution of the saturation field which is represented CV-wise. Moreover, dynamic mesh adaptivity allows high mesh resolution to be employed where it is required to resolve the fingers and lower resolution elsewhere. We use our results to re-examine the existing criteria that have been proposed to govern the onset of instability.\nMesh adaptivity requires the mapping of data from one mesh to another. Conventional methods such as consistent interpolation do not readily generalise to discontinuous fields and are non-conservative. We further contribute a general framework for interpolation of CV fields by Galerkin projection. The method is conservative, higher order and yields improved results, particularly with higher order or discontinuous elements where existing approaches are often excessively diffusive.",

Additional measurements in the aerosol payload in 2015 included aerosol size distributions obtained using a Printed Optical Particle Spectrometer (POPS) and aerosol optical depth obtained using a four wavelength miniature Scanning Aerosol Sun Photometer (miniSASP). The data show most of the column aerosol mass and resulting optical depth in the boundary layer but frequent aerosol layers aloft with high particle number concentration (2000 cm-3) and enhanced aerosol light absorption (1 Mm-1). Transport of these aerosol layers was assessed using FLEXPART particle dispersion models. The data contribute to an assessment of sources of BC to the Arctic and potential climate impacts.",

            "abstract": "The physical organization of soil includes pore networks of varying size and connectivity. These networks control microbial access to soil organic carbon (C) by spatially separating microorganisms and C by both distance and size exclusion. The extent to which this spatially isolated C is vulnerable to microbial transformation under hydrologically dynamic conditions is unknown, and limits our ability to predict the source and sink capacity of soils. We investigated the effects of shifting hydrologic connectivity and soil structure on greenhouse gas C emissions from surface soils collected from the Disney Wilderness Preserve (Florida, USA). We subjected intact soil cores and re-packed homogenized soil cores to simulated groundwater rise or precipitation, monitoring their CO2 and CH4 emissions over 24 hours. Soil pore water was then extracted from each core using different suctions to sample water retained by pore throats of different sizes and then characterized by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. Greater respiration rates were observed from homogenized cores compared to intact cores, and from soils wet from below, in which the wetting front is driven by capillary forces, filling fine pores first. This suggests that C located in fine pores may turn over via diffusion processes that lead to the colocation of this C with other resources and microorganisms. Both the complexity and concentration of soluble-C increased with decreasing pore size domains. Pore water extracted from homogenized cores had greater C concentrations than from intact cores, with the greatest concentrations in pore waters sampled from very fine pores, highlighting the importance of soil structure in physically protecting C. These results suggest that the spatial separation of decomposers from C is a key mechanism stabilizing C in these soils. Further research is ongoing to accurately represent this protection mechanism, and the conditions under which it breaks down, in new and improved Earth system models.",

            "abstract": "Previous campaigns to map Alaska’s coast at high resolution have relied on airborne, marine, or ground-based surveying and manual digitization. The coarse temporal resolution, inability to scale geographically, and high cost of field data acquisition in these campaigns is inadequate for the scale and speed of recent coastal change in Alaska.\nHere, we leverage the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) archive of DigitalGlobe, Inc. satellite imagery to produce a state-wide coastline at 2 meter resolution. We first select multispectral imagery based on time and quality criteria. We then extract the near-infrared (NIR) band from each processed image, and classify each pixel as water or land with a pre-determined NIR threshold value. Processing continues with vectorizing the water-land boundary, removing extraneous data, and attaching metadata.\nFinal coastline raster and vector products maintain the original accuracy of the orthorectified satellite data, which is often within the local tidal range. The repeat frequency of coastline production can range from 1 month to 3 years, depending on factors such as satellite capacity, cloud cover, and floating ice. Shadows from trees or structures complicate the output and merit further data cleaning.\nThe PGC’s imagery archive, unique expertise, and computing resources enabled us to map the Alaskan coastline in a few months. The DigitalGlobe archive allows us to update this coastline as new imagery is acquired, and facilitates baseline data for studies of coastal change and improvement of topographic datasets. Our results are not simply a one-time coastline, but rather a system for producing multi-temporal, automated coastlines. Workflows and tools produced with this project can be freely distributed and utilized globally. Researchers and government agencies must now consider how they can incorporate and quality-control this high-frequency, high-resolution data to meet their mapping standards and research objectives.",

            "abstract": "The Compact Echelle Spectrograph for Aeronomic Research (CESAR) has been sited at Poker Flat Research Range since November 2013, collecting data over two seasons of the nightglow and the aurora. CESAR has operated with a field of view of seven degrees in the zenith direction, with a resolution of 5000, although a resolution three times greater is available. So far, data collection times have been in the range of 20 minutes, while the wavelength range used has been 500-1050 nm. Detailed studies of a number of optical features have been carried out.\n1) It is demonstrated that the v = 2 level of the O2(b) state is best studied by using the weak b-X 2-1 band near 697 nm, it being free of auroral contamination.\n2) Similarly, the best uncontaminated feature of the N2+ Meinel system is the complex A-X 0-1 band, which has been accurately simulated for the first time [Dubowsky and McCall, private communication, 2014].\n3) The N(2P-2D) quartet of lines near 1040 nm is an important auroral feature, being the N-atom equivalent of the oxygen green line. These lines are uncontaminated in many of our spectra. For lower altitude auroral excitation, there may be some overlap with the N2 First Positive 0-0 band [Pendleton et al, 1989].\n4) Time series on the O+(2P-2D) lines near 732-733 nm have been studied, showing variable background emission in this region depending on auroral type.\nInformation on OH Meinel band lines is available throughout the region studied, and there is substantial evidence from sky spectra (Keck, VLT) that the attempt to extract kinetic temperatures from OH intensity distributions is strongly influenced by non-LTE effects [Cosby and Slanger, 2007; Noll et al, 2014].",

To do so requires the evaluation of extended subseasonal and seasonal prediction systems and to determine how their output can be downscaled and statistically post-processed to provide the most useful forecast products for a wide range of users and needs. To that end, the work presented in this talk examines the potential of weekly to monthly environmental prediction along the west coast of the U.S. The synoptic skill of the NOAA Climate Forecasting System (CFS) is to be evaluated over western North America for various projections, seasons, and variables. This work extends to evaluating the influence of temporal averaging on forecast skill, and the value of creating ensembles of CFS forecasts through using lagged and simultaneous CFS forecasts. Finally, the work will reveal whether the skill of CFS forecasts varies over the western U.S., whether certain periods (e.g., El Nino) possess high predictability, and whether specific phenomena (such as atmospheric rivers) possess higher predictability.",

            "abstract": "The boreal forest of Interior Alaska is characterized by frequent extensive wildfires that have been mapped for the past 70 years. Simple predictions based on this record indicate that area burned will increase as a response to climate warming in Alaska. However, two additional factors have affected the area burned in this time record: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) switched from cool and moist to warm and dry in the late 1970s and the Alaska Fire Service instituted a fire suppression policy in the late 1980s. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and statistics, this presentation evaluates the variability in area burned and fire ignitions in Interior Alaska in space and time with particular emphasis on the human influence via ignition and suppression.\nOur analysis shows that while area burned has been increasing by 2.4% per year, the number of lightning ignitions has decreased by 1.9 ignitions per year. Human ignitions account for 50% of all fire ignitions in Interior Alaska and are clearly influenced by human proximity: human fires mostly occur close to settlements, highways and in intense fire suppression zones (which are in turn close to human settlements and roads); fires close to settlements, highways and in intense fire suppression zones burn much shorter than fires further away from this sphere of human influence; and 60% of all human fire ignitions in Interior Alaska are concentrated in the Fairbanks area and thereby strongly influence regional analyses. Fire suppression has effectively reduced area burned since it was implemented but the PDO change has also had some influence. Finally, we found that human fires start earlier in the year and burn for a shorter duration than lightning fires.\nThis study provides insights into the importance of human behavior as well as regional climate patterns as large-scale controls on fires over time and across the Alaskan boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "This report is devoted to the problem of an efficient expansion of multivariate time series, suitable for construction of principal components capturing major part of variability. We present an algorithm for nonlinear transformation of the basis of observational variables, which yields a set of hidden modes of the system. It is based on the nonlinear generalization of standard empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) decomposition, i.e. the observed dataset is projected onto nonlinear curves which represent nonlinear transformations from latent principal component (PC) time series to the space of observational variables. Both the parameters of the transformation and the time series of PCs are found simultaneously by using Bayesian approach. As a prior restriction we use the simplest evolution operator to provide smoothness of the PC’s time series. Finally, Bayesian evidence technique is used to complete the task of correct choice of both the smoothness and the degree of nonlinearity of the transformation.\nThe capabilities of the method are demonstrated on the number of model examples: the applications of the proposed expansion to time series generated by distributed dynamical systems of different complexity are analyzed. The comparison of the expansion with traditional linear decompositions such as EOF or MSSA as well as some existing nonlinear decompositions is presented and discussed. The efficiency of obtained modes for construction of low-dimensional phase space capturing the key dynamical properties of analyzed system is investigated.\nThis research was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (Agreement No. 14.Z50.31.0033 with Institute of Applied Physics RAS)",

New merged data sets show long-term stratospheric cooling which increases in magnitude from the lower to upper stratosphere (-0.5 to -0.7 K/decade), in addition to variations linked to the 11-year solar cycle, QBO, ENSO and volcanic effects. The time series provide evidence that upper stratosphere temperatures have responded to observed changes in ozone, in addition to cooling from increases in CO2.

            "abstract": "In the ocean, intermediate and deep water circulation is extremely important because it transports heat and nutrients globally. The Pliocene warm period is an optimal time in Earth’s history to study how intermediate and deep water circulation functions during globally warm periods. Here we use an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) marine sediment core from the California Margin to investigate changes in intermediate water during the last 4 million years. The benthic foraminifera Uvigerina spp. were picked from ODP Site 1014A core samples, then crushed and chemically cleaned. Using the Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS), Mg/Ca and Li/Mg ratios were measured and converted to bottom water temperatures. These temperatures and the previously published δ18O of benthic foraminifera (Kwiek and Ravelo, 1999) were used to calculate the δ18O of seawater. Reconstructed temperatures during the Plio-Pleistocene are ~2°C, which is cooler than modern temperature (~4°C). As the California Margin is a highly productive region, the Plio-Pleistocene cooler than modern temperatures could be due to post-depositional processes within the sediment as we would expect warmer temperatures during the warm Pliocene in comparison to modern; for this reason, we interpret relative change in temperature and δ18O of seawater changes over the Plio-Pleistocene. Results show that intermediate water during the Pliocene was warmer than Pleistocene. Mg/Ca and Li/Mg-derived δ18O of seawater records increase at ~3100 kyrs, suggesting an increase in ice volume consistent with initiation of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. To isolate local changes in δ18O of seawater, we used available deep Pacific δ18O of seawater records to approximate for changes in mean δ18O of seawater related to Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Local δ18O of seawater show that intermediate water during the Pliocene was fresher than in the Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "The movement of water and solutes through the pore matrix controls the distribution and transformation of carbon (C) in soils. Thus, a change in the hydrologic connectivity, such as increased saturation, disturbance or drought, may alter C mineralization and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes to the atmosphere. While these processes occur at the pore scale, they are often investigated at coarser scale. This project investigates pore- and core-scale soil C dynamics with varying hydrologic factors (simulated precipitation, groundwater-led saturation, and drought) to assess how climate-change induced shifts in hydrologic connectivity influences the destabilization of protected C in soils. Surface soil cores (0-15 cm depth) were collected from the Disney Wilderness Preserve, Florida, USA where water dynamics, particularly water table rise and fall, appear to exert a strong control on the emissions of GHGs and the persistence of soil organic matter in these soils. We measured CO2 and CH4 from soils allowed to freely imbibe water from below to a steady state starting from either field moist conditions or following experimental drought. Parallel treatments included the addition of similar quantities of water from above to simulate precipitation. Overall respiration increased in soil cores subjected to drought compared to field moist cores independent of wetting type. Cumulative CH4 production was higher in drought-induced soils, especially in the soils subjected to experimental groundwater-led saturation. Overall, the more C (from CO2 and CH4) was lost in drought-induced soils compared to field moist cores. Our results indicate that future drought events could have profound effects on the destabilization of protected C, especially in groundwater-fed soils. Our next steps focus on how to accurately capture drought-induced C destabilization mechanisms in earth system models. ",

            "abstract": "Through established scholarship programs, NOAA hosts 125 – 175 undergraduate students each summer to participate in internship opportunities at agency facilities. In order to host a scholar, NOAA labs and offices must designate a mentor who develops a project and oversees activities of the student throughout the summer. NOAA implements best practices in mentoring in the following ways: mentor and intern responsibilities are clearly defined in a manual; mentors are required to take an online mentor training class; mentors and scholars are matched through an online system and scholars conduct a site visit prior to beginning the internship; proposed internship projects are reviewed by scholarship program managers to assure they are sufficiently analytical and will advance the student in their future academic and career goals; and mentors are surveyed at the midpoint, allowing scholarship program managers to identify problems and intervene if possible. These practices have resulted in strong results. Students identify the mentor relationship, hands-on experience and networking with professionals as the three most important outcomes of the internship experience.",

            "abstract": "Full understanding of biogenic aerosol emissions may require modeling of production, interconversion, phase changes and other processes influencing precursor distributions below the ocean surface. We describe a bottom-up, chemical oceanographic approach to the representation of marine sources now under development for Earth System Models in the U.S. Department of Energy. The motivation is to move beyond indirect bulk indicators such as chlorophyll or total dissolved organics. Dynamic mechanistic capabilities are sought for the relevant mixed layer materials and flux fields. The resulting fidelity and predictive capabilities may prove crucial during the era of global change. Reactive transport calculations are outlined for organosulfur, the suite of biomacromolecules, their degradation products plus both interphase or interfacial transitions. Volatile and polymeric substances are controlled on a compound by compound basis, driven by results from a global ecodynamics model of multiple phytotaxa and trophic levels. Surfactant behavior is considered simultaneously at the global bubble and atmospheric interfaces, and such two dimensional chemistry is extended beyond Langmuir monolayers to electrostatically supported films. Colloidal and gel sweeping-impaction by the wind-driven bubble field are considered as alternate means of vertical transport. At the top of the ocean within the microlayer, effects on sea spray number flux are estimated. Moving beyond aerosol emissions, our methods can also provide insight into the uncertainties traditionally inherent to sea-air gas transfer, since they are connected to macromolecular viscoelastics in the laminar barrier layer. We find that resolution of all these subsurface processes is possible at the level of the biogeographic marine province, including specialized treatments for the ice domain, sea ice edge and coastal regime.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) has been a central component of the NASA Earth observation program since the 1990’s.The data collected by NASA’s remote sensing instruments represent a significant public investment in research, providing access to a world-wide public research community. From the beginning, NASA employed a free, open and non-discriminatory data policy to maximize the global utilization of the products derived from NASA’s observational data and related analyses. EOSDIS is designed to ingest, process, archive, and distribute data in a multi-mission environment. The system supports a wide variety of Earth science disciplines, including cryosphere, land cover change, radiation budget, atmosphere dynamics and composition, as well as inter-disciplinary research, including global climate change. To this end, EOSDIS has collocated NASA Earth science data and processing with centers of science discipline expertise located at universities, other government agencies and NASA centers. Commercial industry is also part of this partnership as it focuses on developing the EOSDIS cross-element infrastructure. The partnership to develop and operate EOSDIS has made for a robust, flexible system that evolves continuously to take advantage of technological opportunities. The centralized entrance point to the NASA Earth Science data collection can be found at\nhttp://earthdata.nasa.gov\n. A distributed architecture was adopted to ensure discipline-specific support for the science data, while also leveraging standards and establishing policies and tools to enable interdisciplinary research, and analysis across multiple instruments. Today’s EOSDIS is a loosely coupled, yet heterogeneous system designed to meet the requirements of both a diverse user community and a growing collection of data to be archived and distributed. The system was scaled to expand to meet the ever-growing volume of data (currently ~10 petabytes), and the exponential increase in user demand that has occurred over the past 15 years. We will present how the EOSDIS has relies on partnerships to support the challenges of managing NASA’s Earth Science data.",

            "abstract": "On 5 April 2010, the Galaxy 15 spacecraft, orbiting at geosynchronous altitudes experienced an anomaly near local midnight when it stopped responding to any ground commands. Galaxy 15 spacecraft encountered severe plasma conditions while it was in eclipse and during the subsequent anomaly interval and these conditions included a massive magnetic field dipolarization that injected energetic particles from the magnetotail during a substorm. The GOES and THEMIS satellites were well located in the nightside to observe the substorm. At the time of the field line stretching and dipolarization some of the satellites observed magnetic variations together with particle flux enhancements with periodicities of a few minutes. In this study, we detail characteristics of the perturbation in the magnetic field and particle fluxes that may be an indication of current sheet flapping motion. The exact origin of this flapping motion, particularly the frequency of the variations, is an open question as is the connection between the motion and substorm progression especially particle injection. We will also discuss the wave properties in relation to the kink mode and any evidence of bifurcated structures.",

The prediction intervals are generated using a Multi-layer Stochastic-Learning Model (MSLM), which is developed based on methods such as: sky imaging techniques, support vector machine and artificial neural network. The MSLM is trained using one year of co-located, high-quality irradiance and sky image recording in Folsom, California. In addition to being validated with historical data, the algorithm has been generating operational PI forecasts in real-time for that observatory since July 1st 2014. In the real-time scenario, without re-training or significant maintenance, the hybrid model consistently provides valid PI (PICP > 92%) and outperforms the reference persistence model (PICP ~ 85%) regardless of weather condition. This work has great impact in the field of solar energy to potentially facilitate the level of solar penetration in the grid with significantly reduced integration costs.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols play a central role in many environmental processes by influencing the Earth’s radiative balance, tropospheric chemistry, clouds, biogeochemical cycles, and visibility as well as adversely impacting human health. Based on their origin, atmospheric aerosols can be defined as anthropogenic or natural. Recent studies have shown that a large fraction of uncertainty in the radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols is related to uncertainty in natural—background—aerosols. Marine aerosols are of particular interest due to the abundance of oceans covering the Earth’s surface. Despite their importance, limited information is currently available for size- and composition-resolved marine aerosol emission fluxes. Our group has designed and built an instrument for measuring the size- and hygroscopicity-resolved sea spray aerosol fluxes. The instrument was first deployed during spring 2015 at the end of the 560 m pier of the US Army Corps of Engineers’ Field Research Facility in Duck, NC. Measurements include 200 nm-sized diameter growth factor (hygroscopicity) distributions, sea spray particle flux measurements, and total sub-micron sized aerosol concentration. Ancillary ocean data includes salinity, pH, sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and relative fluorescence (proxy for [Chl-a]). Hygroscopicity distribution measurements show two broad peaks, one indicative of organics and sulfates and another suggestive of sea salt. The fraction of 200 nm-sized salt particles having hygroscopicity similar to that of sea-spray aerosol contributes up to ~24% of the distribution on days with high-speed onshore winds and up to ~3% on calm days with winds blowing from the continent. However, the total concentration of sea-spray-like particles originating from offshore versus onshore winds was relatively similar. Changes in the relative contribution of sea-salt to number concentration were caused by a concomitant changes in total aerosol concentration, indicating a local source.",

These events can cause substantial damage to objects in their paths, like satellites, by penetrating into them and causing radiation. In a related recent study a method was devised to forecast the occurrence of an SEP event using properties of the type II and type III radio bursts measured from WIND/WAVES (Winter & Ledbetter 2015). This study analyzed 27 SEP events from 2010 to 2013. We now present an analysis of type II and type III bursts in solar cycle 23, associated with the 63 SEP events from 2000-2003. Parameters including the peak flux of type II bursts, integral flux of type II and II bursts, and the duration of type III bursts are used to create a radio index. This index is used to predict whether or not an SEP event will occur. Cycle 23 was more active than cycle 24, with significantly more radio bursts and SEP events. Our results show that the radio index successfully predicts the occurrence of SEPs for the events in the more active solar cycle 23. We also find that, in general, the higher the radio index the higher the peak proton flux will be following the burst.",

We present an atmosphere-based method for detecting and quantifying the area and time-averaged surface flux of methane from natural gas infrastructure, and its application to the case-study of Boston, Massachusetts. Continuous measurements of atmospheric methane at a network of stations, inside and outside the city, are used to quantify the atmospheric methane gradient due to emissions from the urban area. Simultaneous observations of atmospheric ethane, and data on the ethane and methane content of the pipeline gas flowing through the region, are used to trace the atmospheric methane enhancement to the natural gas source. An atmospheric transport model is used to quantitatively relate the observed methane enhancement to a surface flux from the whole urban region. We find that methane emissions from natural gas in the urban region over one year was equal to 2.7 ± 0.6 % of the natural gas delivered to the region. Our findings for Boston suggest natural-gas-consuming regions, generally, may be larger sources of methane to the atmosphere than is current estimated and represent areas of significant resource loss.",

            "abstract": "Storm-enhanced densities (SEDs) are increased ion concentrations seen in longitudinally narrow regions extending from middle latitudes to the polar cusp region. Signatures of SEDs have been observed in total electron content measurements obtained from networks of GPS receivers. They have also been observed as plasmaspheric plumes by the extreme ultraviolet imager onboard IMAGE spacecraft, and more recently by the Van Allen Probes. Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain these density enhancements. In order to assess these theories and advance the understanding of the processes causing the dynamical evolution of SEDs in the ionosphere, a global ionosphere-plasmasphere model with a realistic specification of storm time dependent electric field and neutral atmosphere is required. In this study, the recently developed Ionosphere-Plasmasphere-Electrodynamics (IPE) model is used to simulate the SED observed during the March 17th, 2013 geomagnetic storm event. The IPE model provides time dependent, global, three dimensional plasma densities for nine ion species, electron and ion temperatures, parallel and perpendicular velocities of ionosphere and plasmasphere. The geomagnetic storm high latitude drivers rely on the empirical models of the time-dependent Weimer magnetospheric convection and TIROS/NOAA auroral precipitation patterns. The neutral atmosphere composition and winds come from either empirical the MSIS and HWM models, or the Coupled model of the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Plasmasphere and electrodynamics (CTIPe). The simulations are used to evaluate the relative importance between electric field, neutral wind and neutral composition in reproducing the SEDs. Furthermore, observations from ground and space are used to validate the model results.",

Behavior of carbonate-rich silicate melt may be complex, as demonstrated in the reported immiscible behavior in silicate-carbonate melts. However, most of these experiments are limited at low pressures of less than ~3 GPa. Here we investigate behavior of basalt-dolomite melts with 20-61 vol.% dolomite compositions, which corresponds to ~9-27 wt .% CO2, at high pressures to 7.3GPa by using newly developed X-ray phase contrast imaging technique in Paris-Edinburgh cell at beamline 16BMB, HPCAT, in the Advanced Photon Source. We find two phases in ~32-61 vol.% dolomite samples below ~5.5 GPa. Quench sample analysis shows that the two phases are carbonate-bearing silicate melt and a volatile phase, which imply that solubility of CO2 in basalt melt at this pressure condition is smaller than ~14wt.%. In contrast, the ~32-61 vol.% dolomite samples becomes a single liquid above ~5.5 GPa, which imply basalt melt can contain ~32-61 vol.% dolomite (~14-27 wt.% CO2). The abrupt change of CO2 solubility in basalt melt at ~5.5 GPa may play important role in understanding migration of carbonate-rich silicate melt in the upper mantle. For instance, Kono et al. (2014) (Nature Communications, 5, 5091, doi: 5010.1038/ncomms6091) reported significant difference in viscosity of basalt and carbonate melts. Viscosity of carbonate melts are ~2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of basaltic melts in the upper mantle. Abrupt decrease of carbonate content in basalt melt may cause sudden increase of viscosity and the resultant speed-down of melt migration velocity below ~5.5 GPa.",

            "abstract": "Deuterium and oxygen-18 are routinely used with noble gases and radioisotopes (e.g., 2H, 14C, 36Cl) to infer climate during groundwater recharge. However, diffusion of 2H and 18O between a confined aquifer and bounding aquitards could alter total isotope concentrations and the inferred temperature during recharge if groundwater flow is sufficiently slow. Hendry and Schwartz (WRR 24(10), 1988) explained anomalous 2H and 18O enrichment in the Milk River aquifer of Alberta by analytically modeling isotope diffusion between the lower bounding aquitard and the aquifer. Haile (PhD dissertation, U. Kentucky, 2011) inferred the same mechanism to explain 2H and 18O enrichment along a flowpath in the confined Lower Wilcox aquifer of the northern Gulf Coastal Plain in Missouri and Arkansas. Based on the geologic and hydraulic properties of the Lower Wilcox aquifer, a numerical model has been constructed to determine how diffusion may influence 2H and 18O concentrations in regional aquifers with residence times on the order of 104 to 105 years. The model combines solutions for a 1D forward-in-time, finite-difference groundwater flow equation with an explicit-implicit Crank-Nicholson algorithm for advection and diffusion to solve for flow velocity and isotope concentration. Initial results are consistent with the analytical solution of Hendry and Schwartz (1988), indicating diffusion as a means of isotopic enrichment along regional groundwater flowpaths.",

            "abstract": "The history of the planet is recorded in its sedimentary basins where the product of mountain erosion is stored, reflecting climatic and tectonic forcing. Were the sediments and the signal they carry to be immediately deposited in a basin, paleo-reconstructions would be straightforward as the age and nature of a deposit would be a testimony of the source and transfer conditions. The sometime intricate path of clastic material along the sediment routing system complicates greatly the situation. We set here to investigate quantitatively the effect of an alluvial piedmont on the sediment flux that crosses it en route to a basin. We focus on the northern piedmont of the Tian Shan (Xinjiang, China). The piedmont is actively deformed by a fold-and-thrust system and experienced several cycles of incision and aggradation in the Pleistocene. We present new OSL dating of terrace and fan material. These data suggest that the most prominent terraces match three glacial maxima 100 kyr apart; thereby the landscape would primarily react to eccentricity cycles. As a consequence, a significant fraction of sediments produced in that period is temporarily deposited in the piedmont before a later incision phase can deliver it to the basin. The OSL ages of alluvial fan strata exposed and recently eroded by the incising river hint at two aggradation phases during the last two glacial periods. Furthermore lose sediment dated at 300 ka is found to be available along the transport route of the sediments and likely entrained during incision phases. We expect the modern sediment flux entering the basin to contain a significant amount of recycled material as old as 180 ka and a non-negligible amount of recycled material as old as 300 ka that can significantly skew geochemical or provenance studies if ignored.",

            "abstract": "The volcanic-rock aquifers of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui are heavily developed, leading to concerns related to the effects of groundwater withdrawals on saltwater intrusion and streamflow. A numerical modeling analysis using the most recently available data (e.g., information on recharge, withdrawals, hydrogeologic framework, and conceptual models of groundwater flow) will substantially advance current understanding of groundwater flow and provide insight into the effects of human activity and climate change on Hawaii’s water resources. Three island-wide groundwater-flow models were constructed using MODFLOW 2005 coupled with the Seawater-Intrusion Package (SWI2), which simulates the transition between saltwater and freshwater in the aquifer as a sharp interface. This approach allowed relatively fast model run times without ignoring the freshwater-saltwater system at the regional scale. Model construction (FloPy3), automated-parameter estimation (PEST), and analysis of results were streamlined using Python scripts. Model simulations included pre-development (1870) and current (average of 2001-10) scenarios for each island. Additionally, scenarios for future withdrawals and climate change were simulated for Oahu. We present our streamlined approach and preliminary results showing estimated effects of human activity on the groundwater resource by quantifying decline in water levels, reduction in stream base flow, and rise of the freshwater-saltwater interface.",

            "abstract": "The origin of iron oxide mineralization in the Navajo Sandstone on the Colorado Plateau is important because of the different forms of distinct self-organization exhibited by these systems, the potential importance of the cements as geochronometers, and their use as analogs for similar mineralization on other planets. We consider this mineralization to be the product of microbially mediated oxidation of siderite in evolving groundwater systems. Iron oxide grain coatings were dissolved and the iron precipitated as siderite during a reducing phase of diagenesis. Upon invasion by oxidizing waters, iron-oxidizing bacteria colonized the redox interface between siderite-cemented and porous sandstone. Precipitation of iron oxide at this interface generated acid that facilitated further siderite dissolution. One difficulty in testing this hypothesis is that siderite is destroyed by the cm-scale transport of iron during oxidation. There are two lines of evidence that support the presence of a siderite precursor in these systems. 1)Rhombic grains that we interpret to be iron oxide pseudomorphs after siderite occur where in-situ oxidation rather than dissolution of the siderite precursor has occurred. 2) The δ56Fe values of these iron oxide cements are typically negative. We have measured the δ56Fe value of Navajo Sandstone to be 0.2‰; a value in good agreement with previous workers (Chan et al., 2006; Busigny and Dauphas, 2007). Bleaching of the sandstones apparently results in near complete removal of Fe with little change in the δ56Fe values of the bulk sandstone. The δ56Fe values of iron oxide cements have a median value of -0.8‰; similar to the value we obtained from ferroan carbonate (-0.86‰). Iron oxide from samples that comprise largely rhombic grains has similar δ56Fe values (-0.5‰) to those obtained from cements produced by siderite dissolution and subsequent oxidation (-0.4‰). Our interpretation is that siderite precipitated from an aqueous solution in which the δ56Fe value was <0.2‰ yielding siderite with δ56Fe values that ranged upward from -1.4‰. Invasion of the Navajo by oxidizing waters resulted in microbially mediated oxidation of the siderite concretions. The strongly negative values of the Fe oxides result from the near-quantitative oxidation of the siderite in a closed system.",

            "abstract": "In the forearcs of subduction zones, the characteristics of both short-term (temporary earthquake cycle) and longer-term permanent vertical deformation offer insights into processes by which plates subduct. But permanent vertical deformation may be a product of several simultaneous processes, including tectonic erosion/underplating, changing dip of the slab, upward displacement due to buoyancy or bathymetric features, and plastic shortening/extension of the forearc wedge. Here we note the rarely recognized, but possibly common, phenomenon of intermediate time scale transient vertical movements (TVM’s). Both the central New Hebrides and Western Solomon forearcs have uplifted ≥500 m over time scales of 105 yr. Uplift started abruptly (over ≤10 ky) and proceeded at localized rates up to 7-8 mm/yr. Both initial uplifts terminated preceding rapid subsidence of similar dimensions and rates that, in turn, had followed yet older uplift. However, these uplifts and subsidences are superimposed on a yet longer-term trend of uplift on time scales >105 yr. The most recent uplifts extended 100-200 km along-arc and 60-90 km cross-arc while plate convergence was <10 km. These 105 yr vertical oscillations are most likely due to plastic shortening/extension driven by strong horizontal forces related to rugged seafloor bathymetry impinging on the outer forearc. Subsidence follows uplift when horizontal force abates temporarily and uplift is no longer supported by enhanced interplate coupling. Over the 105 yr time frame when interplate slip is <10 km, it is difficult to account for the timing, geography, and amounts of up and down motion by processes such as buoyancy or volumetric displacement of downgoing bathymetric features or by tectonic underplating/erosion. Instead, ~1% of shortening within the upper plate is sufficient to account for up to several hundred m of uplift across a large area of the forearc.",

            "abstract": "The Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) product uses the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique to measure ground subsidence, active layer thickness (ALT), and thermokarst activity in permafrost regions. ReSALT supports research for the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) field campaign in Alaska and northwest Canada and is a precursor for a potential Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) product. ALT is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost and thermokarst activity is one of the key drivers of change in permafrost regions. The ReSALT product currently includes 1) long-term subsidence trends resulting from the melting and subsequent drainage of excess ground ice in permafrost-affected soils, 2) seasonal subsidence resulting from the expansion of soil water into ice as the active layer freezes and thaws, and 3) ALT estimated from the seasonal subsidence assuming a vertical profile of water within the soil column. ReSALT includes uncertainties for all parameters and is validated against in situ measurements from the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, Ground Penetrating Radar and mechanical probe measurements. We present high resolution ReSALT products on the North Slope of Alaska: Prudhoe Bay, Barrow, Toolik Lake, Happy Valley, and the Anaktuvuk fire zone. We believe that the ReSALT product could be expanded to include maps of individual thermokarst features identified as spatial anomalies in the subsidence trends, with quantified expansion rates. We illustrate the technique with multiple examples of thermokarst features on the North Slope of Alaska. Knowing the locations and expansion rates for individual features allows us to evaluate risks to human infrastructure. Our results highlight the untapped potential of the InSAR technique to remotely sense ALT and thermokarst dynamics over large areas of the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Compact intracloud discharges (CIDs) persist to date as one of the most mysterious lightning manifestations. CIDs are known to be the strongest natural sources of radio-frequency radiation on Earth. At VHF frequencies, approximately above 30 MHz, their emitted power is ten times stronger than that of other lightning processes. The well-known strength of CIDs in VHF contrasts with the lack of substantial optical measurements. CID's VLF/LF electric field change waveforms resemble one full cycle of a distorted sine function, with the first half-cycle being (a few times) larger-amplitude and shorter-duration than the second. For this reason CIDs have been dubbed narrow bipolar events (NBEs). NBE waveshapes are strikingly similar to the largest initial breakdown pulses (IBPs) that occur during the earlier stages of a conventional lightning flash, called classic IBPs. The similarity between classic IBP and NBE far-field waveforms, combined with the fact that positive-polarity NBEs frequently appear as the first event in an otherwise regular positive intracloud discharge, may be indicative that the source of these two E-field pulse types share the same physical mechanism inside thunderclouds [da Silva and Pasko, JGR, 120, 4989–5009, 2015].\nIn this presentation, we introduce a novel way to investigate CIDs. We show evidence that CIDs can produce an unique ionospheric signature, named \"elve doublets\". These signatures are characterized by a pair of elves separated in time by 80–160 microseconds. Our analysis combines fast photometric elve data, equivalent-transmission-line models to describe the dynamics of CID source currents, and FDTD modeling of electromagnetic wave propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide accounting for its nonlinear interaction with the lower ionosphere [Marshall et al., GRL, 42, 2015, doi:10.1002/2015GL064862]. We show that typical (negative-polarity) CID altitudes, between 14–22 km, explain the time delay observed in elve doublets, where the first elve in the doublet is generated by the direct EMP path and the second is generated by its ground reflection. Furthermore, we show that the relative brightness of the first and second elves is likely related to the CID orientation, and angles of 5°–20° with respect to the vertical are consistent with the observed brightness ratios.",

In 1975 subsidence was retained under the framework of the UNESCO IHP (subproject 8.4: “Investigation of Land Subsidence due to Groundwater Exploitation”), and UNESCO IHP formerly codified the Working Group on Land Subsidence (WGLS). In 1984 the WGLS produced a comprehensive guidebook to serve scientists and engineers, confronting land subsidence problems, particularly in developing countries (\nhttp://unesdoc.unesco.org/$other/unesdoc/pdf/065167eo.pdf)\n.\nDuring the IHD, UNESCO IHP convened the 1st International Symposium on Land Subsidence in 1969 in Tokyo, Japan.

The 9 published symposia proceedings constitute an important source of global subsidence research and case studies during the past 45 years, covering both anthropogenic and natural subsidence processes.\nCurrently, the WGLS comprising 20 subsidence experts from 9 countries promotes and facilitates the international exchange of information regarding the design, implementation and evaluation of risk assessments and mitigation measures, the definition of water and land resource-management strategies that support sustainable development in areas vulnerable to subsidence (http://landsubsidence-unesco.org), and the assessment of related geological risks such as earth fissuring and fault activation (www.igcp641.org). The WGLS has become an important global leader in promoting subsidence awareness, scientific research and its application to subsidence monitoring, analysis and management.",

            "abstract": "The direct penetration of large scale global electric field to the inner magnetosphere is a critical element in controlling how the background thermal plasma populates within the radiation belts. These plasma populations provide the source of particles and free energy needed for the generation and growth of various plasma waves that, at critical points of resonances in time and phase space, can scatter or energize radiation belt particles to regulate the flux level of the relativistic electrons in the system. At high geomagnetic activity levels, the distribution of large scale electric fields serves as an important indicator of how prevalence of strong wave-particle interactions extend over local times and radial distances. To understand the complex relationship between the global electric fields and thermal plasmas, particularly due to the ionospheric dynamo and the magnetospheric convection effects, and their relations to the geomagnetic activities, we analyze the electric field and cold plasma measurements from Van Allen Probes over more than two years period and simulate a geomagnetic storm event using Coupled Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Model (CIMI).\nOur statistical analysis of the measurements from Van Allan Probes and CIMI simulations of the March 17, 2013 storm event indicate that: (1) Global dawn-dusk electric field can penetrate the inner magnetosphere inside the inner belt below L~2. (2) Stronger convections occurred in the dusk and midnight sectors than those in the noon and dawn sectors. (3) Strong convections at multiple locations exist at all activity levels but more complex at higher activity levels. (4) At the high activity levels, strongest convections occur in the midnight sectors at larger distances from the Earth and in the dusk sector at closer distances. (5) Two plasma populations of distinct ion temperature isotropies divided at L-Shell ~2, indicating distinct heating mechanisms between inner and outer radiation belts. (6) CIMI simulations reveal alternating penetration and shielding electric fields during the main phase of the geomagnetic storm, indicating an impulsive nature of the large scale penetrating electric field in regulating the gain and loss of radiation belt particles. We will present the statistical analysis and simulations results.",

            "abstract": "Soils are important sinks for greenhouse gases globally. Urbanization influences biogeochemical processes and gas fluxes through increased nitrogen deposition, heat island effects, and vegetation management. Previous work at the Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER site has reported elevated CO2 fluxes and reduced CH4 consumption in urban soils. Differences among soils (urban forest, rural forest, lawns) have been linked to nitrogen cycling and may also be driven by temperature differences between land cover types. A combination of site-specific changes (land cover, nitrogen availability) and climatological (temperature, soil moisture) factors are likely to influence long-term patterns in gas fluxes and therefore carbon storage in growing urban regions. We utilized 15 years of measured gas fluxes and continuous temperature and soil moisture data to model CO2 emissions and CH4 consumption under different vegetation classes. We scaled these fluxes to the metropolitan region using high-resolution spatial, and found that regional CH4 consumption and CO2 fluxes are sensitive to changes in temperature and land cover. For instance, in 2007 land cover in Baltimore City had 21% lawn and 22% forest cover. If all of the lawn area in the city were converted to urban forest, CH4 consumption by urban soils would increase by 70% and CO2 emissions would decrease by 20%. In suburban Baltimore County, lawns and urban forests comprised 35 and 50% of land cover respectively. If all lawns in the county were converted to urban forest, soil CH4 consumption would increase by 55% and soil CO2 flux would decrease by 20%. Soil CO2 fluxes also increase by approximately 0.1g C m-2 d-1 for every 1° C increase across all land cover classes. CH4 consumption increases with temperature in urban and rural forest soils. Our results highlight the interacting effects of land cover change and climate on carbon fluxes from urban soils.",

            "abstract": "Standard data collection strategy in magnetotellurics (MT) is to deploy a profile or array of sites that spans the target of interest. There is no expectation that structure can be imaged outside the area covered by sites. We have inverted two MT arrays for 3D structure under Argentina. The two arrays do not overlap, but serendipitously the 3D model for the northern array overlaps the position of a prominent 3D deep conductive structure seen in the inversion of the southern array. To our surprise this deep southern feature is also imaged by the northern array even though it is well outside the footprint of the northern array. It therefore appears that typical intuition about one's ability to image structure outside the span of the sites is not always true. We present model studies to demonstrate why this is so and under what conditions one can expect a 3D array to be capable of imaging structure outside the array.",

            "abstract": "Within Latin American, about 315 volcanoes that have been active in the Holocene, but according to the United Nations Global Assessment of Risk 2015 report (GAR15) 202 of these volcanoes have no seismic, deformation or gas monitoring. Following the 2012 Santorini Report on satellite Earth Observation and Geohazards, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has developed a 3-year pilot project to demonstrate how satellite observations can be used to monitor large numbers of volcanoes cost-effectively, particularly in areas with scarce instrumentation and/or difficult access. The pilot aims to improve disaster risk management (DRM) by working directly with the volcano observatories that are governmentally responsible for volcano monitoring, and the project is possible thanks to data provided at no cost by international space agencies (ESA, CSA, ASI, DLR, JAXA, NASA, CNES). Here we highlight several examples of how satellite observations have been used by volcano observatories during the last 18 months to monitor volcanoes and respond to crises -- for example the 2013-2014 unrest episode at Cerro Negro/Chiles (Ecuador-Colombia border); the 2015 eruptions of Villarrica and Calbuco volcanoes, Chile; the 2013-present unrest and eruptions at Sabancaya and Ubinas volcanoes, Peru; the 2015 unrest at Guallatiri volcano, Chile; and the 2012-present rapid uplift at Cordon Caulle, Chile. Our primary tool is measurements of ground deformation made by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) but thermal and outgassing data have been used in a few cases. InSAR data have helped to determine the alert level at these volcanoes, served as an independent check on ground sensors, guided the deployment of ground instruments, and aided situational awareness. We will describe several lessons learned about the type of data products and information that are most needed by the volcano observatories in different countries.",

            "abstract": "Mercury has seven stable isotopes, and during most biogeochemical reactions all of the isotopes fractionate mass dependently (MDF; relative to δ202/198Hg). The odd isotopes also fractionate mass independently (MIF) during reactions involving the magnetic isotope and nuclear volume effects. In 2010 we first reported MIF of 200Hg in precipitation (Gratz et al), and in 2013 we reported MIF of 204Hg in precipitation (Demers et al). Measurements of Δ200Hg are becoming more common and several studies have now used Δ200Hg as a tracer of Hg(II) deposited from the atmosphere (Chen et al, 2012; Strok et al 2015). Δ204Hg is much less commonly measured and reported, but sheds additional light on the mechanisms that might cause even isotope MIF. We observe Δ204Hg to be of opposite sign and ~2x the magnitude of Δ200Hg. The presence of coupled Δ200Hg and Δ204Hg is most useful for detecting precipitation inputs of Hg to ecosystems. We have measured Δ200Hg and Δ204Hg in hundreds of samples of precipitation, invertebrates, fish, moss, lichen, ice crystals and GEM at many locations in North America and Hawaii. When average values for each sample type at each study location are plotted as Δ200Hg versus Δ204Hg they fall on a linear array with slope=0.57 and R2=0.92. Samples of sediment, coal, various rock-types, and point-source contaminants have contrasting Δ200Hg and Δ204Hg indistinguishable from zero. We also use combined Δ200Hg and Δ204Hg to explore mechanisms leading to even isotope MIF. Ghosh et al (2012) measured nuclear volume fractionation and found even MIF to be undetectable. Mead et al (2013) calculated even mass MIF from nuclear self-shielding and it does not fit our observations of Δ200Hg/Δ204Hg in natural samples; they also measured MIF caused by implantation of Hg into glass in compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) and this is consistent with Δ200Hg/Δ204Hg in atmospheric Hg(II), suggesting the possibility of a common fractionation mechanism.",

Previous\nstudies have proposed the collapse of the continental margin in the Desoto Canyon region of the\nGulf of Mexico to be associated with the extraterrestrial impact, but provide limited evidence to\nsupport their claims. Seismic analysis of offshore two-dimensional (2D) seismic data, well logs,\nand biostratigraphic data provides insight into the Paleogene history of the carbonate margin\nslope failure and readjustment along the Florida escarpment. A slope’s stability is dependent on\nthe slope material’s shear strength, which resists slope failure, and the force of gravity, which\ndrives slope failure. However, the slopes of carbonate platforms are seldom homogenous and\nreceive and lose sediment through the complex interplay of deposition, erosion, and dissolution.\nIt is hypothesized the collapse of the Florida continental margin resulted in a layer of limestone\nforming a steep slope due to its hardness producing a higher shear strength and angle of repose.\nWhen this is succeeded by the deposition of siliciclastic sediments a period of slope readjustment\ntakes place. These finer and softer sediments are unable to assume the high slope angle of the\nunderlying carbonate sediments. This slope adjustment is continued throughout the Paleogene as\nthe out-of-grade slope of the Mass Transport Complex adjusts to reach equilibrium.

            "abstract": "Methylmercury (MeHg) is a neurotoxin produced in anoxic aquatic sediments. Numerous factors, including the presence of aquatic plants, alter the biogeochemistry of sediments, affecting the rate at which microorganisms transform bioavailable inorganic Hg (IHg) to MeHg. Methylmercury produced in flooded paddy soils and its transfer into rice has become an important dietary consideration. An improved understanding of how MeHg reaches the grain and the extent to which rice alters MeHg production in rhizosphere sediments could help to inform rice cultivation practices. We conducted a controlled greenhouse experiment with thirty rice plants grown in individual, flooded pots amended with enriched 200Hg. Unvegetated controls were maintained under identical conditions. At three plant growth stages (vegetative growth, flowering, and grain maturity), ten plants were sacrificed and samples collected from soil, roots, straw, panicle, and grain of vegetated and unvegetated pots, and assessed for MeHg and THg concentrations. We observed consistent ratios between ambient and tracer MeHg between soils (0.36 ±0.04 — 0.44 ± 0.09) and plant compartments (0.23 ± 0.07 –0.34 ± 0.05) indicating that plant MeHg contamination originates in the soil rather than in planta methylation. The majority of this MeHg was absorbed between the tillering (4.48 ± 2.38 ng/plant) and flowering (8.43 ± 5.12 ng/pl) phases, with a subsequent decline at maturity (2.87 ± 1.23 ng/pl) only partly explained by translocation to the developing grain, indicating that MeHg was demethylated in planta. In contrast, IHg was absorbed from both soil and air, as evidenced by the higher ambient IHg concentrations compared to tracer (3.76 ± 1.19 vs. 0.27 ± 0.40 ng/g). Surprisingly, MeHg accumulation was significantly (p= 0.042-- 0.003) lower in vegetated vs. unvegetated sediments at flowering (1.41 ± 0.26 vs. 1.57 ± 0.23) and maturity (1.27 ± 0.22 vs. 1.71 ± 0.25), suggesting that plant exudates bound Hg(II) and reduced its bioavailability to mercury methylators. Our findings confirm, for the first time, the soil origin of MeHg to rice and suggest research towards enhancing in planta demethylation or reducing uptake during vegetative growth as mitigation measures for this serious public health concern.",

The higher rotational levels are clearly not in LTE, and using sky spectra from the large telescopes (Keck, VLT) has now shown that this assumption is invalid even for low rotational levels [Cosby and Slanger, 2007; Noll et al. 2014]. The apparent temperatures derived from such Boltzmann plots show an upward trend with increasing OH vibrational level, from v = 2 to v = 9, with reproducible structure such that there is always a peak at v = 8. Over this range of vibrational levels, the “temperature” increase with increasing altitude is on the order of 15-20 K. At the same time, the modeled kinetic temperature is decreasing, as the OH layer lies below the mesopause, and rocket/satellite measurements indicate that the highest levels have the highest altitude. Since this technique of kinetic temperature assessment has been in use for many years, it is important to realize that the procedure is flawed, most likely due to the details of the relaxation processes of OH(v).",

Exploiting the inverse relationship between the length of a wire antenna and its electrical resonant frequency, an aqueous electrolyte solution can be injected into a borehole, and the rate at which the leading edge of the plume advances can be determined by measuring the time-rate-of-change of the plume’s electrical resonant frequency using a commercial antenna analyzer. Experiments were conducted to calibrate the relationship between the electrical resonant frequency of the electrolyte plume and its physical length in water-saturated porous media. Length-versus-resonant-frequency calibration obtained from measurements on wires housed in buried conduits representing preferential flow paths through a model aquifer exhibit close agreement with theoretical predictions based on theory describing the behavior of wire antennas in air. The advantages of this method for subsurface characterization include that it is 1) deployable by one person, 2) not dependent on inversion methods, 3) effective in a single borehole, and 4) not scale dependent.",

            "abstract": "Recent damaging earthquakes in areas predicted to be relatively safe illustrate the need to assess how seismic hazard maps perform. At present, there is no agreed way of assessing how well a map performed. The metric implicit in current maps, that during a time interval predicted shaking will be exceeded only at a specific fraction of sites, is useful but permits maps to be nominally successful although they significantly underpredict or overpredict shaking, or nominally unsuccessful but predict shaking well. We explore metrics that measure the effects of overprediction and underprediction. Although no single metric fully characterizes map behavior, using several metrics can provide useful insight for comparing and improving maps. A related question is whether to regard larger-than-expected shaking as a low-probability event allowed by a map, or to revise the map to show increased hazard. Whether and how much to revise a map is complicated, because a new map that better describes the past may or may not better predict the future. The issue is like deciding after a coin has come up heads a number of times whether to continue assuming that the coin is fair and the run is a low-probability event, or to change to a model in which the coin is assumed to be biased. This decision can be addressed using Bayes’ Rule, so that how much to change depends on the degree of one’s belief in the prior model. Uncertainties are difficult to assess for hazard maps, which require subjective assessments and choices among many poorly known or unknown parameters. However, even rough uncertainty measures for estimates/predictions from such models, sometimes termed BOGSATs (Bunch Of Guys Sitting Around Table) by risk analysts, can give users useful information to make better decisions. We explore the extent of uncertainty via sensitivity experiments on how the predicted hazard depends on model parameters.",

            "abstract": "What is the potential of a global transition to a vegan lifestyle to sequester carbon and mitigate climate change? To answer this question, we use an Earth System Model (ESM), the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM). ISAM is a fully coupled biogeochemistry (carbon and nitrogen cycles) and biogeophysics (hydrology and thermal energy) ESM, which calculates carbon sources and sinks due to land cover and land use change activities, such as reforestation and afforestation.\nWe calculate the carbon sequestration potential of grasslands and pasturelands that can be reverted to native forests as 265 GtC on 1.96E+7 km2 of land area, just 41% of the total area of such lands on Earth. The grasslands and pasturelands are assumed to revert back to native forests which existed prior to any human intervention and these include tropical, temperate and boreal forests. The results are validated with above ground regrowth measurements. Since this carbon sequestration potential is greater than the 240 GtC of that has been added to the atmosphere since the industrial era began, it shows that such global lifestyle transitions have tremendous potential to mitigate and even reverse climate change.",

            "abstract": "Present-day airborne lidar surveys of polar ice, NASA's Operation IceBridge foremost among them, cover large geographical areas. They are often compared with previous surveys over the same flight lines to yield mass balance estimates. Systematic biases in the lidar system, especially those which vary from campaign to campaign, can introduce significant error into these mass balance estimates and must be minimized before the data is released by the instrument team to the larger scientific community. NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) team designed a thorough and novel approach in order to minimize these biases, and here we describe two major aspects of this approach. First, we conduct regular ground vehicle-based surveys of lidar calibration targets, and overfly these targets on a near-daily basis during field campaigns. We discuss our technique for conducting these surveys, in particular the measures we take specifically to minimize systematic height biases in the surveys, since these can in turn bias entire campaigns of lidar data and the mass balance estimates based on them. Second, we calibrate our GPS antennas specifically for each instrument installation in a remote-sensing aircraft. We do this because we recognize that the metallic fuselage of the aircraft can alter the electromagnetic properties of the GPS antenna mounted to it, potentially displacing its phase center by several centimeters and biasing lidar results accordingly. We describe our technique for measuring the phase centers of a GPS antenna installed atop an aircraft, and show results which demonstrate that different installations can indeed alter the phase centers significantly.",

            "abstract": "During times of strong magnetospheric disturbances, large-amplitude electric fields penetrate from the Earth’s magnetosphere to the E-region ionosphere where they generate small-scale plasma density turbulence. This turbulence induces nonlinear currents and leads to anomalous electron heating. Current global MIT models completely disregard these nonlinear effects by assuming simple laminar ionospheric flows. This talk will present the results from incorporating these effects separately into both the TIEGCM ionosphere and the LFM magnetosphere simulators. Adding models of anomalous E-region heating to TIEGCM leads to significant changes in ionospheric electron density, temperature, and conductivity in the E region, often exceeding the effects of particle precipitation. Adding anomalous E-region conductivies to LFM causes a range of effects to the structure of the magnetosphere plus it reduces the cross-polar-cap potential by about 25%. In both simulators it allows the field-aligned currents to close in a smaller volume and at higher amplitudes, modifying the nature of energy deposition. This work shows that, in order to accurately model Space Weather, researchers require physically accurate E-region conductivities.",

            "abstract": "Observations indicate that extreme weather events are increasing and it is likely that this trend will continue through the 21st century. However, there is uncertainty and disagreement in recent literature regarding the mechanisms by which extreme temperature and precipitation events are increasing, including the suggestion that enhanced Arctic warming has resulted in an increase in blocking events and a more meridional flow. A steady gradual increase in heavy precipitation events has been observed in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States, while the Southwestern United States, particularly California, has experienced suppressed precipitation and an increase in consecutive dry days over the past few years. The frequency, intensity, and duration of heavy precipitation events in the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States, as well as drought in the Southwestern United States are examined using the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2). Indices developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices representing drought and heavy precipitation events have been calculated using the MERRA-2 dataset for the period of 1980 through 2014. Trends in these indices are analyzed and the indices are compared to large scale circulations and climate modes using a composite and statistical linkages approach. Statistically significant correlations are present in the summer months between heavy precipitation events and meridional flow despite the lack of enhanced Arctic warming, contradicting the suggested mechanisms. Weaker, though still significant, correlations are observed in the winter months when the Arctic is warming more rapidly than the Midlatitudes.",

            "abstract": "Marine ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced climate change affecting their physical and biogeochemical environment. At present, future projections of marine ecosystem drivers are inherently uncertain, complicating assessments of climate change impacts. Here we evaluate the relative importance of specific sources of uncertainties in projections of marine ecosystem drivers (warming, acidification, nutrient availability and declining oxygen levels) as a function of prediction lead-time and spatial scales. We show that the uncertainty in century-scale global and regional surface pH projections is dominated by scenario uncertainty, highlighting the critical importance of policy decisions on carbon emissions. In contrast, uncertainty in century-scale sea surface temperature projections in polar regions, oxygen levels in low oxygen waters, and regional nutrient availability is dominated by model uncertainty, underscoring that overcoming deficiencies in scientific understanding and improved process representation in Earth system models are critical for making more robust predictions. For smaller spatial and temporal scales, uncertainty associated with internal variability also constitutes an important source of uncertainty, suggesting irreducible uncertainty inherent in these projections. We also show that changes in the combined multiple ecosystem drivers emerges from the noise in 44% of the ocean in the next decade and in 57% of the ocean by the end of the century following a high carbon emissions scenario. Changes in pH and sea surface temperature can be reduced substantially and rapidly with aggressive carbon emissions mitigation, but only marginally for oxygen and net primary productivity. The broader scientific implications, including downscaling of Earth system model output for large marine ecosystem regions and for impact assessment models, will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The probability distributions of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic variables are generally\nskewed and heavy-tailed. We argue that their distinctive departures from Gaussianity arise fundamentally\nfrom the fact that in a quadratically nonlinear system with a quadratic invariant, the coupling\ncoefficients between system components are not constant but depend linearly on the system\nstate in a distinctive way. In particular, the skewness arises from a tendency of the system trajectory\nto linger near states of weak coupling. We show that the salient features of the observed non-\nGaussianity can be captured in the simplest such nonlinear 2-component system. If the system is\nstochastically forced and linearly damped, with one component damped much more strongly than\nthe other, then the strongly damped fast component becomes effectively decoupled from the\nweakly damped slow component, and its impact on the slow component can be approximated as a\nstochastic noise forcing plus an augmented nonlinear damping. In the limit of large time-scale\nseparation, the nonlinear augmentation of the damping becomes small, and the noise forcing can\nbe approximated as an additive noise plus a correlated additive and multiplicative noise\n(CAM noise) forcing. Much of the diversity of observed large-scale atmospheric and oceanic\nprobability distributions can be interpreted in this minimal framework.",

            "abstract": "Reactive carbon plays a key role in driving the oxidative chemistry of the atmosphere and is a precursor to ozone and particulate matter formation, both of which impact human health and climate. However, uncertainties on the lifecycle of reactive carbon in the atmosphere remain large. In part this can be attributed to the chemical complexity and variety of species reactive carbon in the atmosphere, and the resulting lack of mass closure in both ambient measurements and models.\nIn this study we investigate how the reactive carbon budget is represented in a global model, GEOS_Chem, and provide some initial comparisons with observations. We examine the simulated spatiotemporal distribution of the primary and secondary gas and particle phase organic tracers and assess the total organic carbon burden, its vertical distribution and seasonal variation. We use the model sources, sinks, and burden to construct a budget for reactive carbon which we discuss using three properties for categorization: chemical composition, volatility and reactivity.\nSince the representation of wet deposition and cloud chemistry differs widely in global models leading to large uncertainties, we also focus our analysis on the wet scavenging of soluble organic species within GEOS-Chem. We compare our simulation with compilations of observed reactive carbon from a series of surface and airborne field campaigns. Finally, we discuss possible modeling improvements for assessing and testing the representation of the reactive carbon budget.",

For the individual scientist, an effective way to mitigate the risks and maximize the benefits of speaking about climate science in public arenas is to front-load the work of communication strategizing. Scientists can build their own roadmaps for how they will talk about both their own narrow field of study and the broad field of climate change. The workload generated by this includes prioritizing science communication training events, especially in the early career timeframe, building a suite of social media and entrepreneurial skills, and delineating personal boundaries of advocacy, objectivity, and morality.

            "abstract": "The understanding of the transport behaviors in porous media resides on the ability to reproduce fundamental phenomena in a lab setting. Experiments with quasi 2D tanks filled with beads are performed to study physical phenomena induced by chemical and fluid dynamic processes. When an alkaline solution containing heavy metals or radionuclides invades a low pH region, mixing due to longitudinal dispersion induces destabilization of the front forming a fast travelling pulse [1]. When the two fluids travel in parallel, instead, mixing induced by transverse dispersion creates a continuous leakage from the alkaline region into the acidic one forming a fast travelling plume [2] (Figure 1). Impact of these phenomena are on aquifers upon leaking of alkaline fluids, rich in heavy metals and radionuclides, from waste storage sites.\nHere, we report the results from a study where experiments with a quasi 2D tank are performed to analyze the effect of transverse mixing on strontium (Sr2+) transport. To visualize the leaking plume, a fluorescent dye (Fura-2) is added the acidic solution, which has been widely used in biomedical applications [3]. It is the aim of this work to optimize its application under the conditions relevant to this work. Spectrometric measurements of absorption and fluorescence show sensitivity of the dye to the presence of Sr2+ throughout a broad range of pH and Sr2+ concentration (Figure 2). In the absence of Sr2+, no significant absorption and fluorescence was measured, but as Sr2+ was added the relevant peaks increase significantly and sample dilution of tenfold was required to remain within the measuring threshold. These results show a strong sensitivity of the dye to the cation opening the opportunity to use Fura-2 as a tool to visualize heavy metals and radionuclides plumes.\n",

It is shown that gravity-wave induced variations in the neutral wind lead to plasma variations both perpendicular and parallel to the geomagnetic field, and that these variations are a function of gravity wave propagation direction relative to the geomagnetic field. In addition we find that the ionosphere response is affected by altitude range of the gravity waves; specifically whether or not the gravity waves penetrate above the F peak. It is found that the TEC exhibits variations +/- 0.15 TECU and the 6300A airglow emission variation is up to +/- 2.5% relative to the unperturbed background airglow, consistent with observations.",

            "abstract": "In order to constrain the distribution of volatiles, i.e., carbon, in the terrestrial planets today, we must understand its fate during the magma ocean (MO) stage. In particular, we must know the solubility of C in the silicate MO because this has key bearing on the relative distribution of C in all the major reservoirs, i.e., the metallic core, the early atmosphere, and the mantle [1]. In an MO, C can dissolve as oxidized (CO32-) and reduced (CO, CH4) species, which varies as a function of fO2; yet, for a MO with fO2 between IW-2 to +2, the dominant form of C is CO32- [2]. It is therefore critical to determine the CO2 solubility in ultramafic/peridotitic melt at reducing conditions. Previous work attempted to constrain the C content of ultramafic melt chiefly by extrapolating measured CO2 solubility in mafic/basaltic compositions using NBO/T [3]. However, using only NBO/T may not reliably take into account the effects of different network modifiers, like Ca2+ and Mg2+, on CO2 solubility, as their relative roles remain ambiguous [4,5].\nTo constrain the CO2 solubility in ultramafic compositions at graphite saturation, we determined CO2 contents of 4 silicate compositions spanning between natural basalts and peridotite (NBO/T from 0.8 to 1.5, MgO from 8 to 21 wt.%, and Ca# from 0.4 to 0.2), using Pt/Gr capsules and a piston cylinder device. Experiments were conducted at 1.0 GPa and 1600 °C. FTIR was used to measure dissolved CO32- and H2O (≤0.5 wt.%) contents. For graphite-saturated glasses at ~IW+1.6, CO2 contents increase from ~0.4 to 0.9 wt.% with increasing NBO/T and decreasing Ca#.\nThese experimental results, combined with previous data, allow us to construct a more complete CO2 solubility model of reduced silicate melts as a function of P, T, fO2, and composition. By determining CO2 solubility on a continuum of compositions between basalt and peridotite, we will more accurately constrain the tradeoffs between core-MO partitioning and MO-atmosphere interactions and begin to place constraints on the initial carbon content of the mantle soon after MO crystallization.\n[1] Dasgupta (2013) RiMG.

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events are characterized by infrequent but large magnitude accummulatations that generally occur on scales belowthat resolved by the typical Global Climate Model. The Multi-scale Modeling Framework allows for information about the precipitation on these scales to be simulated for long periods of time without the large computational resources required for the use of a full cloud permitting model. The Community Earth System Model was run for 30 years in both its MMF and GCM modes, and the annual maximum series of 24 hour precipitation accumulations were used to estimate the parameters of statistical distributions. The distributions generated from model ouput were then t to a General Extreme Value distribution and evaluated against observations. These results indicate that the MMF produces extreme precipitation with a statistical distribution that closely resembles that of observations and motivates the continued use of the MMF for analysis of extreme precipitation, and shows an improvement over the traditional GCM. The improvement in statistical distributions of annual maxima is greatest in regions that are dominated by convective precipitation where the small-scale information provided by the MMF heavily influences precipitation processes.",

            "abstract": "Much earth and space science data and metadata are managed and supported by an infrastructure of repositories, ranging from large agency or instrument facilities, to institutions, to smaller repositories including labs. Scientists face many challenges in this ecosystem both on storing their data and in accessing data from others for new research. Critical for all uses is ensuring the credibility and integrity of the data and conveying that and provenance information now and in the future. Accurate information is essential for future researchers to find (or discover) the data, evaluate the data for use (content, temporal, geolocation, precision) and finally select (or discard) that data as meeting a \"fit-for-purpose\" criteria. We also need to optimize the effort it takes in describing the data for these determinations, which means making it efficient for the researchers who collect the data.  At AGU we are developing a program aimed at helping repositories, and thereby researchers, improve data quality and data usability toward these goals. AGU has partnered with the CMMI Institute to develop their Data Management Maturity (DMM) framework within the Earth and space sciences. The CMMI DMM framework guides best practices in a range of data operations, and the application of the DMM, through an assessment, reveals how repositories and institutions can best optimize efforts to improve operations and functionality throughout the data lifecycle and elevate best practices across a variety of data management operations. Supporting processes like data operations, data governance, and data architecture are included.   An assessment involves identifying accomplishment, and weaknesses compared to leading practices for data management. Broad application of the DMM can help improve quality in data and operations, and consistency across the community that will facilitate interoperability, discovery, preservation, and reuse.\nGood data can be better data. Consistency results in sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Climate changes result from all forces, natural and anthropogenic. Among various anthropogenic factors, greenhouse gases, aerosol and urbanization are arguably the most significant ones whose effects are often hard to differentiate, as they often intertwined together. It is, however, extremely, important to separate their effects for the sake of both science (e.g. accounting for them in GCMs) and for making sound policy in light of their diverse implications. Few places in the world are more affected by all three factors than China where decades of fast development have drastically altered atmospheric and terrestrial environment with huge greenhouse emissions. Such changes have left deep footprints in the climate system. While the anthropogenic impact is substantial, it is a nontrivial task to detangle them. In this talk, I will present a pilot study showing how changes in temperature and precipitation are linked with these factors with a particular focus on temperature and precipitation. From their long-term observations, we are able to see the contributions of increasing air pollution to mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, and rainfall of varying intensity from drizzle to thunderstorms. By means of analysis of long-term meteorological records and model simulations, we have tried to differentiate natural and anthropogenic changes in the climate of China.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by land surface models is strongly affected by uncertain ecosystem parameters and initial conditions. A possible approach is the estimation of plant functional type (PFT) specific parameters for sites with measurement data like NEE and application of the parameters at other sites with the same PFT and no measurements. This upscaling strategy was evaluated in this work for sites in Germany and France. Ecosystem parameters and initial conditions were estimated with NEE-time series of one year length, or a time series of only one season. The DREAM(zs) algorithm was used for the estimation of parameters and initial conditions. DREAM(zs) is not limited to Gaussian distributions and can condition to large time series of measurement data simultaneously. DREAM(zs) was used in combination with the Community Land Model (CLM) v4.5. Parameter estimates were evaluated by model predictions at the same site for an independent verification period. In addition, the parameter estimates were evaluated at other, independent sites situated >500km away with the same PFT. The main conclusions are: i) simulations with estimated parameters reproduced better the NEE measurement data in the verification periods, including the annual NEE-sum (23% improvement), annual NEE-cycle and average diurnal NEE course (error reduction by factor 1,6); ii) estimated parameters based on seasonal NEE-data outperformed estimated parameters based on yearly data; iii) in addition, those seasonal parameters were often also significantly different from their yearly equivalents; iv) estimated parameters were significantly different if initial conditions were estimated together with the parameters. We conclude that estimated PFT-specific parameters improve land surface model predictions significantly at independent verification sites and for independent verification periods so that their potential for upscaling is demonstrated. However, simulation results also indicate that possibly the estimated parameters mask other model errors. This would imply that their application at climatic time scales would not improve model predictions. A central question is whether the integration of many different data streams (e.g., biomass, remotely sensed LAI) could solve the problems indicated here.",

            "abstract": "Slow slip events (SSEs) are observed in the circum-Pacific subduction zones and exhibit a wide diversity of source parameters (including equivalent moment, duration and recurrence interval). Gao et al [2012] compiled source parameters of SSEs around the world and revealed their empirical scaling relations distinct from those of regular earthquakes. However, the nature of this diversity is unclear. Previous 3-D numerical simulations in a simplified plate model have reproduced the along-strike segmentation of episodic SSEs in Cascadia margin and their source scaling relations in the framework of rate- and state- friction law [Liu, 2014]. But the planar fault model is inefficient to investigate the effect of the fault geometry on the source characteristics of SSEs in a specific subduction zone.\nIn this study, we adopt a non-planar Cascadia subduction fault geometry constrained by relocated seismicity [McCrory et al. 2012] in the rate-state friction model. We have reproduced episodic SSEs beneath Vancouver Island and Washington arising every ~1.5 year with a maximum cumulative slip of ~2.5 cm. We find three phases characteristic in cumulative moment rate and slip rate in each episode. These three phases, defined as nucleation, fast-spreading and healing, lasting for ~160, ~60 and ~140 days, respectively. Both the nucleation and healing phases are beneath GPS detection threshold but the nucleation phase is spatially correlated with the small tremor activities arising deeper than episodic tremor and slip (ETS).\nTo further investigate the diversity of SSEs in Cascadia, we introduce the recent 6-year tremor locations in Cascadia (http://pnsn.org/tremor) to constrain the near-lithostatic pore pressure distribution at the SSE depths in an 800km-long Cascadia fault model. Additionally, we set a step change of effective normal stress in SSE region from 1.5 MPa in Vancouver Island and Washington to 2.0 MPa in Oregon. The results show that the modeled SSEs exhibit distinct slip ‘patches’ along the strike (Fig. 1). This distribution of average cumulative slip is correlated with the frictional heterogeneity introduced by tremor locations. We also calculate the rupture area, equivalent moment and duration of each event and compare their scaling relations with the results of GPS inversions[Schmidt and Gao, 2010].",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to have dramatic impacts on built infrastructure, particularly in the water resources sector where infrastructure tends to have long lifespans and performance is highly sensitive to climate conditions. However, adapting to water resources infrastructure to climate change is challenging due to the considerable uncertainty surrounding projections of future hydrologic conditions. This has prompted the development of a number of approaches aimed at supporting planning under “deep-uncertainty” which cannot be represented probabilistically. One such method is robust decision making (RDM), which uses simulation models to assess how systems perform over a wide range of future scenarios and identify vulnerable scenarios where system performance is unacceptable. With the Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia as a case study, we use an RDM analysis to assess the vulnerability of planned irrigation infrastructure to climate change and environmental uncertainties related to data limitations. We find that planned infrastructure is vulnerable not only to climate change, but also to poorly characterized environmental conditions today. This suggests areas for research that could provide important insights into the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the planned projects. Additionally, we evaluate the degree to which methods such as irrigation efficiency and upstream land conservation can improve the long-term performance of the proposed infrastructure. In doing so, we demonstrate how robust decision frameworks can provide decision support in data-scarce regions where more complex modeling and analysis may be impractical.",

The surface is too often obscured by cloud cover for visual and infrared sensors and observations from radar sensors are too infrequent to create consistent historical databases or for monitoring current conditions. Passive microwave sensors, such as SSM/I, AMSR-E, and AMSR-2, acquire useful data during clear and cloudy conditions, have revisit periods of up to twice daily, and provide a continuous record of data from 1987 to the present. In this presentation, we will describe results from a flood mapping system capable of producing high-resolution (100-m) flood extent depictions from lower resolution (10-40-km) microwave data. The system uses the strong sensitivity of microwave data to surface water extent combined with land surface and atmospheric data to derive daily flooded fraction estimates globally on a sensor footprint basis. The system downscales flooded fraction to make a high-resolution Boolean flood extent depiction that is both spatially continuous and consistent with the lower resolution data (see Figure). The downscaling step is based on a relative floodability index derived from higher resolution topographic and hydrological data and processed to represent the minimum total water fraction threshold above which each grid point is expected to be flooded given microwave-derived water fraction inputs. We have completed daily, 100-m resolution flood maps for Africa for the 9.3-year AMSR-E period and will soon complete global flood maps fo the same period. We will present animations of daily flood extents during major events and discuss: validation of the flood maps against imagery derived from MODIS and Landsat data; analyses of minimum detectable flood size; statistical analyses of flooding over time; applications for this novel historical dataset; and prospects for near real-time flood mapping.",

The eruption was identified when ships in the area intersected a pumice raft, which was subsequently tracked by NASA MODIS satellite imagery. In 2015, an NSF-sponsored research cruise to the area conducted AUV and ROV dives to map and sample the deposits of this eruption. This presentation describes the high-resolution mapping data and seafloor observations that illustrate the processes of lava and pyroclast transport and deposition. The National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) AUV Sentry collected multibeam bathymetry data over the Havre caldera rim and floor - an area of 56 km2 - at a resolution of 1m. In addition, Sentry collected high-resolution sidescan sonar backscatter data over the same area. The NDSF ROV Jason collected HD video and down-looking still imagery along dive transects. These data allow us to document the depositional landforms in great detail. Notable features include effusive domes, lava flows, and a widespread blanket of giant pumice and ash. With constraints from seafloor imagery, we use the morphology of the imaged landforms to delineate deposit extents, identify intra-flow and intra-deposit features, pinpoint vent locations, and, in comparison with pre-eruption bathymetry, determine eruptive volumes. This information informs preliminary models of transport and deposition processes that are unique to submarine explosive eruptions.",

To advance our understanding of the accuracy of the RO profiles at mid latitudes, we performed a comprehensive comparison of RO measurements made by the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites and observations of Ne profiles made by the Arecibo Observatory incoherent scatter radar (ISR).\nCOSMIC is formed by six satellites in circular, 800 km altitude low-Earth orbit (LEO) at 72° inclination. The satellites orbit in their own plane, approximately 24° apart in ascending node. The satellites are equipped with dual-frequency GPS receivers capable of making measurements of the total electron content (TEC) along the signal path and, therefore, RO observations.\nThe Arecibo ISR, located at(18.35°N, 66.75°W; ∼28.25°N dip latitude), operates at a frequency of 430 MHz with a maximum bandwidth of about 1 MHz. The large collecting area provided by the 300 m dish antenna combined with high peak power transmitters (2.0–2.5 MW) allows the radar to make accurate Ne measurements throughout the entire ionospheric F-region and topside heights.\nWe analyzed 74 and 89 days of line feed and Gregorian data, respectively, collected between 2006 and 2014. There were 638 RO profiles measured within 10° of latitude and 20° of longitude from Arecibo Observatory and within ±10 minutes of the radar measurements.\nPreliminary analyses of the observations show patterns in the relationship between densities measured by the Arecibo ISR and densities estimated from the COSMIC ROs. We will present and discuss the behavior of the patterns. We will also present results of a numerical model representing the patterns and discuss the possibility of using this model to improve RO estimates of density profiles.",

            "abstract": "Hot Creek Gorge contains the most obvious surface expression of the hydrothermal system in Long Valley Caldera, California, discharging 200-300 L/s of thermal water according to USGS measurements made since 1988. Formerly, Hot Creek was a popular public swimming area, but it was closed in 2006 due to unpredictable temperature fluctuations and sporadic geysering of thermal water within the creek (Farrar et al. USGS Fact Sheet2007-3045). The USGS has monitored the thermal regime in the area since the mid-1980s, including a long-term series of studies 0.6 km away at well CH-10b. Temperature measurements in the ~100 m deep well, which have been performed on an intermittent basis since it was drilled in 1983, reveal a complex temperature profile. Temperatures increase with depth to a maximum at about 45 meters below the ground surface, and then decrease steadily to the bottom of the well. The depth of the temperature maximum in the well (~45 m) corresponds to an elevation of ~2,120 m, roughly equivalent to the elevation of Hot Creek, and appears to sample the same hydrothermal flow system that supplies thermal features at the surface in the gorge. Starting in the early 1990s, the maximum temperature in CH-10b rose from 93.4°C to its peak in 2007 at 101.0°C. A cooling trend was observed beginning in 2009 and continues to present (99.3°C in June 2015). As the input into CH-10b is at the elevation of the creek, it exhibits the potential for response to thermal events at Hot Creek, and could provide a useful tool for monitoring future hazards.\nOn short timescales, CH-10b also responds to large global earthquakes, greater than ~M7. These responses are captured with continuously logged high-frequency data (5s), and are usually characterized by a co-seismic water level drop of up to ten centimeters. Water levels tend to recover to pre-earthquake levels within a few hours to days.",

            "abstract": "The Jurassic Wingate Sandstone show prominent color variations throughout southeastern Utah due to diagenetic changes. The characteristic diagenetic changes suggest fluid-rock interactions through the sandstone. Distinctive spectral signatures of diagenetic minerals can be used to map diagenetic heterogeneities and possibly fluid-flow pathways. The main objective of this work was to identify characteristic diagenetic minerals, and map their spatial variability at outcrop scale in Wingate Sandstone exposures of Lisbon Valley, Utah. Laboratory reflectance spectroscopy analysis of the samples facilitated identification of diagnostic spectral characteristics of the common diagenetic minerals and their relative abundances between altered and unaltered Wingate Sandstone. Comparisons of reflectance spectroscopy with ground-based imaging spectroscopy data provided a method for mapping fluid-related diagenetic heterogeneities and fluid-flow pathways in near vertical rock faces of steep outcrops. Additionally, ASTER satellite and HyMap airborne data helped evaluating spatial variations of diagenetic mineral at a broader scale in plan-view. The ground-based hyperspectral data demonstrated the ability to identify and map mineral assemblages with two-dimensional lateral continuity on near-vertical rock faces. The bleached and unbleached areas are alternating throughout the vertical face of the outcrop. The relative hematite abundance observed in the unbleached areas in the vertical section are somewhat symmetrical. This indicates fairly similar reaction intensities along the upper and lower reaction fronts observed in the vertical section. The distribution geometry and relative abundances of diagenetic minerals not only suggest multiple paths of fluid-flow in Wingate Sandstone but also provides some insight about relative direction of past fluid-flow.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that arrival of the Yellowstone plume below North America triggered a lithospheric foundering event which aided the eruption of the Columbia River flood basalts. This hypothesis potentially accounts for some of the biggest mysteries related to the CRB's including their location as “off-track” plume volcanism; and the anomalous chemical signatures of the most voluminous units.\nThe foundered lithosphere appears to be a remnant chunk of Farallon slab, which had been stranded beneath the Blue Mountains terrain since the accretion of Siletzia. If this is the case then the mechanisms by which this slab stayed metastable between Siletzia accretion and CRB time, and then so suddenly broke loose, is unclear. The addition of heat and mantle buoyancy supplied by the Yellowstone plume provides a clue, but the geodynamic process by which the slab was able to detach remains unclear.\nEfforts to model numerically the underlying processes behind delamination events have been gaining popularity. Typically, such models have relied on drastically weakened regions within the crust, or highly non-linear rheologies to enable initiation and propagation of lithosphere removal. Rather than impose such a weak region a priori, we investigated the role of mantle and crustal melt, generated by the addition of plume heat, as the source of such a rheologic boundary.\nWe track melt generation and migration though geodynamic models using the Eulerian finite element code, ASPECT. Melt moves relative to the permeable, compacting, and viscously-deforming mantle using the approach of (Keller, et al. 2013) with the notable exception that ASPECT currently cannot model elasticity. Dike and sill emplacement is therefore still a work in progress. This work is still in the preliminary stages and results are yet inconclusive.",

Past studies (1,2) reported that the helicity at large scales has a definite dominant sign organized with respect to the heliospheric current sheet, with negative helicities occurring north of the current sheet, and positive helicities south. The present study confirms this pattern and extends it by more than two solar cycles and past the most recent solar maximum. Particle scattering by turbulence with finite magnetic helicity is one of only two known particle transport mechanisms that are sensitive to particle charge sign and magnetic field polarity.

            "abstract": "The GPM core satellite, launched in February of 2014, provides a number of advances for satellite monitoring of precipitation including a dual-frequency radar, high frequency channels on the GMI radiometer, and coverage over middle and high latitudes. The GPM concept, however, is also about producing unified precipitation retrievals from a constellation of microwave radiometers to provide ~3 hourly global sampling. The GPM intersatellite calibration working group, or XCAL team, is tasked with developing adjustments to the brightness temperature data from the constellation radiometers to make the radiometric calibrations physically consistent by accounting for differences in channel frequencies, polarizations, and view angles. The GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) is used as both a transfer standard as well as the calibration reference given that it has been shown to be extremely well calibrated and stable. After launch, several deep space calibration maneuvers were performed, and the resulting data was used to develop and/or refine calibration corrections and to check for issues found to impact prior radiometers such as an emissive reflector, polarization errors, and solar intrusion effects. Once the GMI calibration was finalized, the XCAL team focused on developing calibration adjustments for the other constellation radiometers. These corrections are developed independently by different team members, compared to identify potential issues, and merged to create calibration adjustment tables. The subsequent reprocessing of the GPM constellation datasets marks the transition from the at-launch calibrations and retrieval algorithms, which were based on TRMM data, to ones developed from GPM observations. The focus of the XCAL team now shifts towards improving corrections of sensor calibration issues, refining intercalibration techniques, and developing calibration adjustments for the TRMM-era constellation radiometers for reprocessing back to the TRMM launch in late 1997.",

These instruments use solid state silicon detectors as sensor. Their designs feature multi-detector coincidence telescopes, combined with degrader material, tungsten shielding and data processing algorithms to optimize the signal to noise ratio. Details of the mechanical and electronic design will be presented. Key aspects of data processing including background subtraction techniques and a novel method to distinguish high energy rear entry particles from front entry ones will be described. Results of extensive modeling with GEANT4 will be compared with calibration data measured over nearly the entire energy range of the instruments. Combination of the two will be used to calculate the geometric factors of the various energy channels. A listing of the channels and their properties will be presented. The calibrated geometric factors and typical and extreme space weather environments will be used to calculate the expected on-orbit performance. The specifications that the instruments met ensure proper operation under the most stressful high flux conditions corresponding to the largest solar particle event expected during the program and high sensitivity at low flux levels.

            "abstract": "The rapidly diminishing Arctic sea ice cover impacts the overlying atmospheric state through changes in moisture and surface energy fluxes. These atmospheric responses may even reach the mid-latitudes; however, physical mechanisms linking Arctic change to mid-latitude weather remain unclear. We utilize present-day coupled general circulation model (GCM) output from NCAR’s Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) to investigate the role of autumn sensible heat flux anomalies in forcing atmospheric responses in the Arctic and mid-latitudes. The self-organizing map (SOM) technique is used to characterize daily weekly-averaged sensible heat flux anomaly patterns over the Arctic. The atmospheric response is diagnosed by creating composites of atmospheric and sea ice variables (such as 2-m temperature, sea level pressure, geopotential height at various vertical levels, and sea ice thickness and concentration, for each heat flux pattern identified by the SOM technique from the Arctic to 30°N for each week for up to 12 weeks after a given pattern occurs) in order to identify the spatial patterns and temporal persistence required to force the remote atmospheric responses. A SOM pattern with prominent upward sensible heat fluxes extending from the Beaufort to Chukchi Seas exhibits a coherent progression of robust, anomalous downstream temperature and circulation responses, reaching the eastern United States about eight weeks after the initial heat flux anomaly. Persistent sea ice thicknesses may be important in forcing the atmospheric responses, highlighting the utility of using coupled GCM output and coupled systems reanalyses for observational studies.",

Researchers on the Land Change Research Project (LCRP) are working to assess spatial agreement, characterize uncertainties, and resolve discrepancies between these national level datasets, in regard to forest disturbance. Disturbance maps from the Global Forest Change (GFC), Landfire Vegetation Disturbance (LVD), National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT), Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD), and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) were harmonized using a pixel-based data fusion process. The harmonization process reconciled forest harvesting, forest fire, and remaining forest disturbance across four intervals (1986-1992, 1992-2001, 2001-2006, and 2006-2011) by relying on convergence of evidence across all datasets available for each interval. Pixels with high agreement across datasets were retained, while moderate-to-low agreement pixels were visually assessed and either manually edited using reference imagery or discarded from the final disturbance map(s). National results show that annual rates of forest harvest and overall fire have increased over the past 25 years. Overall, this study shows that leveraging the best elements of readily-available data improves forest loss monitoring relative to using a single dataset to monitor forest change, particularly by reducing commission errors.",

            "abstract": "The arid western slopes of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano record pre-historic landscape changes that accompanied occupation by Native Hawaiians. Stratigraphy in the Keamuku area shows that a long (c. 38-42 ka) period of airfall and eolian deposition and pedogenesis was terminated by at least 8 layers of charcoal-rich sediment, interbedded with sand and shells of land snails that were transported by running water. Streams across Keamuku then cut several meters down through these deposits to bedrock of the Hamakua Volcanics. Radiocarbon ages indicate that charcoal-rich layers were deposited from the 13th-14th Century A.D. (e.g., 1207 +/- 48; 1287 +/- 128 A.D.) through the 17th - 18th century (e.g., 1648 +/- 157; 1651 +/- 160 A.D.; mean probability +/- 2 sigma. Stream incision commenced sometime thereafter. We measured saturated hydraulic conductivities (Ksat) with a mean of 56 mm/hour in nearby soils with tree and shrub cover. This value exceeds common hourly rainfall intensities, so runoff from these landscapes is unlikely without disturbance. Work at a wildfire boundary in Molokai, Hawaii, shows that just after fire disturbance, saturated hydraulic conductivities of similar Hawaiian soils are one half to one fifth of unburned equivalents.\nOne interpretation is that during the 13th-19th centuries and later, humans burned shrub- or tree-covered landscapes reducing soil infiltration capacities. Over the course of several hundred years of burning, one or more large storms with sustained hourly rainfall intensities exceeding the infiltration capacity of the altered land surface occurred soon enough after fires to generate runoff in a place that had not previously experienced it. This runoff carved the existing gully network across over 100 km2 of Keamuku area, as wildfires pushed the shrub-/tree-line upslope. This interpretation joins a growing body of thought that pre-historic human’s use of fire fundamentally altered landscapes.",

Differences in sea ice and low-level temperatures are examined in detail. The NAVGEM-CICE5 configuration results in a larger coverage of sea ice compared to the NAVGEM-CICE4 configuration, and this is consistent with thicker sea ice in the NAVGEM-CICE5 runs. Low-level temperatures in the NAVGEM-CICE4 are greater during Northern Hemisphere spring compared to the NAVGEM-CICE5 configuration. NAVGEM-CICE5 has larger albedos compared to the NAVGEM-CICE4 configuration and may be a primary cause in the lower low-level temperatures.

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to study overcome the natural complexity of karst.

Several mathematical and computing models are available in the literature for each approach. In this study one computer model has been selected for each category to validate its usefulness to model flow in karst using a sandbox experiment. The models chosen are: Modflow 2005, Modflow CFPV1 and Modflow CFPV2. A sandbox experiment was implemented in such way that all the parameters required for each model can be measured. The sandbox experiment was repeated several times under different conditions. The model validation will be carried out by comparing the results of the model simulation and the real data. This model validation will allows ud to compare the accuracy of each model and the applicability in Karst. Also we will be able to evaluate if the results of the complex models improve a lot compared to the simple models specially because some models require complex parameters that are difficult to measure in the real world.",

            "abstract": "Recent fieldwork, improved radiocarbon dating, and mapping on recently acquired LiDAR base have better delineated timing, frequency, and style of volcanism at Glacier Peak. The work shows that, after Mount St. Helens, Glacier Peak is one of the most frequently active Cascade volcanoes. The volcano has erupted multiple times 13–14 ka, 5­–7 ka, 1–2.5 ka, and perhaps as recently as a few hundred years ago. The plinian eruptions of ~13.5 ka were much more voluminous than those of Mount St. Helens in 1980 and show that Glacier Peak is among the most explosive of Cascade volcanoes. These eruptions dispersed ash fallout hundreds of kilometers downwind in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming; produced a partly welded ignimbrite and a small debris avalanche; and caused lahars and flooding far across Puget Sound lowland. Numerous more recent eruptions during the periods 5–7 ka and 1–2.5 ka extruded lava domes whose hot rock avalanched across snow and ice to produce pyroclastic flows and lahars. These eruptions dispersed ash tens of to a hundred or more kilometers downwind. Resulting lahars and floods inundated as far as Puget Sound lowland.\nGlacier Peak is remote and hidden from most areas of the densely populated Puget Sound lowland; hence, it gets less attention than other prominent Cascade volcanoes like Mounts Rainier, Baker, and St. Helens. Despite its remote location, Glacier Peak poses substantial hazard because even small eruptions on ice-clad volcanoes can have devastating consequences. Distal threats include hazard to air traffic owing to ash plumes. Lahars and potential long-term sedimentation and flooding downstream pose threats to communities near rivers along Skagit and Stillaguamish River drainages. Farther downstream, sedimentation is likely to decrease channel capacity, increasing likelihood of floods. Lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches will threaten hikers in the wilderness near Glacier Peak.",

            "abstract": "Arctic ecosystems are changing dramatically due to changes in climate, vegetation and human activities. Northwestern Siberia is one of the regions which has been undergoing various land cover and land use changes associated primarily with animal husbandry and oil/gas development. These changes have been exacerbated by warming climatic conditions over the last fifty years. In this study, we investigated land cover and land use changes associated with oil and gas development southeast of the city of Nadym within the context of climate change based on multi-source and multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. The impacts of land use on surface vegetation, radiation, and hydrological properties were evaluated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The results from a comparison between high spatial resolution imagery acquired in1968 and 2006 indicate that the vegetation cover was reduced in areas disturbed by oil and gas development. Vegetation cover increased in natural landscapes over the same period,. Water logging was found along the linear structures near the oil/gas development, while in natural landscapes the drying of thermokarst lakes is evident due to permafrost degradation. Derived indices suggest that the direct impacts associated with infrastructure development are mostly within 100 m distance from the disturbance source. While these impacts are rather localized they persist for decades despite partial recovery of vegetation after the initial disturbance.",

            "abstract": "The solar Magnesium (Mg) II index, derived from the ratio of measurements across a solar absorption feature (280nm) in nearby spectral bands, serves as a proxy for solar chromospheric variability. Various space-borne instruments acquire MgII index data and, in comparison across instruments, the data appears to follow different temporal trends. These variations may lead to variations in the interpretation of model outputs used to understand and predict complex dynamics such as climate variability and space weather. This study seeks to reconcile the discrepancies between three MgII data sets in an attempt to create one, composite MgII index with elements common to all. For this investigation we use three temporally coincident data sets spanning 2003 to 2012: the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) SOLar STellar InterComparison Experiment (SOLSTICE), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 16, and the University of Bremen Composite, compiled from various satellite records.\nUsing wavelet analysis, we identify the statistically significant and independent signals of four known solar time scales in each of the data sets: the 24.7 day solar rotational period, the 12 day half-solar rotational period, the 3-7 month average lifetime of an active region, and the 11 year solar cycle. We then explore the time scales of variability remaining in the data records. We seek to define the remaining signal components as solar in origin, assumed common between sets, or as potentially originating from instrumental artifacts, not common to all sets. We find a signal with a 1-2 year period common to the three data records; a further comparison with the San Fernando Observatory (SFO) Calcium (Ca) II record establishes this period to be present in ground-based chromospheric variability measurement. In a last step, we use Bayesian analysis to quantify the uncertainty of a revised data set, comprised only of signals of known solar origin.",

            "abstract": "Lagoa das Furnas is a crater lake located in an area exposed to geohazards from earthquakes and volcanic activity on the island São Miguel in the Azores Archipelago. The Furnas volcanic center has a long history of earthquakes and volcanic activity. The area is relatively well studied except for the lake floor. Therefore, a high resolution geophysical and geological mapping survey was conducted at Lagoa das Furnas. Sidescan sonar was used to map the surface of the lake floor and single beam sonar was used to acquire sub-bottom profiles. In addition to the geophysical mapping, sediment surface sampling and core drilling were carried out followed by geochemical analyses of the retrieved material. The mapped data permitted a characterization of the floor of Lagoa das Furnas and revealed several volcanic features including fumarolic activity and a previously uninvestigated volcanic cone in the southern part of the lake. In order to unravel the origin of this cone several methods were applied, including analyses of tephra and minerals collected from the cone itself and from nearby deposits of two known eruptions, Furnas I and Furnas 1630. Sedimentological, petrological, geochemical and geochronological studies of pyroclastic deposits from the cone suggest a subaqueous eruption linked to the Furnas 1630 eruption. The chemistry of glass and crystal fragments sampled from the cone suggests that it is composed of more evolved magma than that of the main Furnas 1630, implying that the lake cone is likely a product of the last eruptional phase. According to historical records, two of three lakes were lost due the Furnas 1630 eruption. The results of this study show that the remaining lake is most likely Lagoa das Furnas, which consequently must have existed before the 1630 eruption.",

            "abstract": "To understand Earth’s climate, we must first understand the Sun. However, there are still significant uncertainties associated with both the fundamental mechanisms of solar variability and how they enter into the Earth’s climate system. An important method to study the causes of solar variability can be found through the analysis of solar images. The Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (PSPT) located at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) acquires images of the Sun in three different photometric bands to monitor the evolution of solar surface features that change over the course of a solar cycle. These images provide a complete knowledge about the Sun by targeting different layers of the solar atmosphere. Though raw images are meaningful and important, precision image processing is required to remove instrumental artifacts and false features that may appear in these images prior to usage for scientific purposes. A scientific application of the high precision solar images is investigated by analyzing a set of narrow band of Calcium II K core and wing images. The Core and Wing images are processed to remove the influence of the center-to-limb variation; the resultant core-to-wing ratio image enhances the appearance of network structures on the entire solar disk along with the more obvious facula and plage brightening associated with the passage of active regions.",

            "abstract": "To better understand the discrepancies between current top-down and bottom-up estimates, additional methane (CH4) measurements are necessary for regions surrounding growing oil and natural gas (ONG) development. We have evaluated satellite measurements of CH4 in US regions with ONG operations for their application as “top-down” constraints (part of the NASA Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (AQAST) project). For validation of the satellite instruments’ sensitivities to emitted gases, we focus on regions where the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) campaign deployed ground and aircraft measurements in Maryland (2011), California and Texas (2013), and Colorado (2014). The largest CH4 signals were observed in the Greater Green River and Powder River Basins using Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) Representative Tropospheric Volume Mixing Ratio (RTVMR) measurements. A long-term comparison between a ground remote-sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) at Boulder and TES for 2010-2013 shows good correlation and differences ranging 2.5-5% for their yearly distribution of total column CH4. To determine any correlation between lower/mid-tropospheric CH4 (where a thermal IR sensor, such as TES, is most sensitive) and near-surface/boundary CH4 (where sources emit), we analyze the variability of DISCOVER-AQ aircraft profiles using principal component analysis and assess the correlation between near-surface (0-2 km) and mid-tropospheric (>2 km) CH4 concentrations. Using these relationships, we estimate near-surface CH4 using mid-tropospheric satellite measurements based on the partial column amounts within vertical layers with a linear regression. From this analysis, we will demonstrate whether the uncertainties of satellite-estimated near-surface CH4 are comparable to observed variability near ONG activity. These results will assist validation of satellite instrument algorithms for emissions estimates and/or provide additional information for correcting existing (TES, IASI and SCIAMACHY) and future (TROPOMI) satellite-retrieved observations.",

            "abstract": "Process-based models are a powerful approach to test our understanding of biogeochemical processes, to extrapolate ground survey data from limited plots to the landscape scale and to simulate the effects of climate change, nitrogen deposition, elevated atmospheric CO2, increasing natural disturbances and land use change on ecological processes. However, in most studies, the models are calibrated using ground measurements from only a few sites, though they may be extrapolated to much larger areas. Estimation accuracy can be improved if the models are parameterized using long-term carbon stock data from multiple sites representative of the simulated region. In this study, vegetation biomass and soil carbon stocks, and changes in these stocks over a recent decade, were measured in 61 forested plots located in three small watersheds in the Delaware River Basin (DRB). On average, total vegetation biomass was 160.2 Mg C ha-1 and the soil carbon stock was 76.6 Mg C ha-1, measured during 2012-2014. The biomass carbon stock increased by 2.45 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 from 2001-2003 to 2012-2014. This dataset was subsequently used to parameterize the PnET-CN model at the individual plot basis, and averaged parameters among plots were then applied to generate new watershed-scale model parameters for each of the three watersheds. The parameterized model was further validated by the field measurements in each of the major forest types. The spatial distribution of forest carbon pools and fluxes in three watersheds were mapped based on the simulation results from the newly parameterized PnET-CN model. The model will also be run under different scenarios to test the effects of climate change, altered atmospheric composition, land use change, and their interactions within the three watersheds and across the whole DRB.",

            "abstract": "Land surface temperature Ts plays a vital role in the determination of sensible (H) and latent heat flux, upwelling long-wave radiation, and ground heat flux. While it is widely recognized that there is a range of skin temperatures represented in even a homogeneous canopy, it is often necessary or convenient to treat the surface as isothermal. This study investigates, at the sub-canopy scale, the implications of assuming that a canopy is isothermal. The focus is on profiles within the canopy of air, foliage, and soil surface temperature, and of sensible and latent heat flux source strength.\nData from a dense grassland at the Southern Great Plains experiment in 1997 (SGP97) were used to assess the ability of a multi-layer canopy model to match measured sensible and latent heat fluxes along with radiometric surface temperatures. In its standard mode, the model solves the energy balance for each canopy layer and uses Localized Near Field (LNF) theory to model the turbulent transport. The results suggest the model captures the most important features of canopy flux generation and transport, and support its use to investigate scalar profiles within canopies. For 112 data points at SGP97, the model produced realistic temperature and sensible heat flux source profiles. In addition, it was run in a mode that seeks the isothermal (soil and foliage) skin temperature (Ti) that provides the same Hproduced by the model in its standard mode. This produces profiles of air and foliage temperature and of sensible heat source strength that differ significantly from profiles from the standard mode.\nBased on these simulations, realistic canopies may have a mixture of positive and negative sensible heat flux sources at various heights, typically with large contributions from the soil surface. There is frequently a discontinuity between foliage temperatures near the soil and the actual soil surface temperature. For isothermal canopies, heat sources at all levels had the same sign and soil surface contributions tended to be small. One persistent feature of Ti is that it is highly correlated with the temperature of the foliage in the middle of the canopy (or near the height with the greatest leaf density). Model-estimated radiometric surface temperatures Tr match measured values well, but Ti tends to be cooler than Tr for positive H and warmer for negative H.",

            "abstract": "Soils are additional but poorly resolved sinks of carbonyl sulfide (COS) in terrestrial ecosystems. COS has been proposed as a tracer for quantifying gross photosynthesis based on the coupled stomatal uptake of COS and CO2. But applying this tracer requires the soil COS flux to be subtracted from the ecosystem flux to obtain the actual plant flux. To simulate soil COS fluxes, we have built a 1-D diffusion-reaction model accounting for vertical transport in the soil, microbial sinks and sources, and a litter layer. Uptake and production of COS in the soil column are linked with soil temperature and moisture through empirical functions adapted from enzyme kinetics and lab incubations.\nWe have measured soil COS fluxes and the related soil variables in four distinct ecosystems: a wheat field (Southern Great Plains, OK, USA), an oak woodland (Santa Monica Mountains, CA, USA), a tropical rainforest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica) and a boreal pine forest (Hyytiälä, Finland). Across all sites, a lower soil temperature and a humid climate are generally favorable to soil COS uptake. Strong COS emissions were observed in the wheat field at high soil temperatures after harvesting but were absent in other ecosystems, indicating that COS exchange may behave differently in agricultural soils. We simulated the soil fluxes in all ecosystems using the diffusion-reaction model, and optimized the source/sink strength parameters with field data. The optimized model provides insights that are not attainable from data analysis alone: For example, the wheat field soil must have continued uptake activity even when it showed net emissions, and leaf litter contributed dominantly to the COS sink after rain in the oak woodland. We expect the new model to be useful for simulating global soil COS fluxes as field data on soil fluxes from a broader range of ecosystems become available.",

            "abstract": "The precision and accuracy of carbonate δ18O & δ13C analysis by multicollector SIMS is well established if standards match samples in structure and major/minor element chemistry. However, low-T- and bio-carbonates used to construct paleoclimate archives can include complex internal structures and some samples analyzed at WiscSIMS (and other SIMS labs) have a consistent, sample-dependent offset between average SIMS δ18O measurements and bulk δ18O analyses by phosphoric-acid digestion. The offset is typically <1‰, but recent work has discovered samples where the offset is greater — up to 1.8‰ (average SIMS δ18O values < corresponding conventional measurements). Notably, δ13C offsets have not been observed even in samples with a δ18O offset.\nWe conducted tests to characterize the δ18O offset in different low-T carbonate materials. Multiple potential causes were examined: perhaps the measured offset is real and conventional analyses include material that SIMS excludes (and vice versa); analytical errors and inter-lab (mis)calibration; depth-profiling effects; porosity; and the effects of variable minor element composition. One explanation implicates water and/or organic matter within carbonate that is ionized during SIMS analysis, but sometimes removed for bulk analysis. Two diagnostic tools help monitor such contaminants during SIMS analysis: 1) simultaneous measurement of [16O1H], and 2) secondary ion yield. Offsets of 0.3 to 1.8‰ in δ18O correlate to [16O1H] for 7 studies of Nautilus, foraminifera, pteropods and speleothems. Offsets were not observed in all foraminifera.

How are we doing in the hydrologic sciences? As part of a significant collaborative effort that brought together scientists from public, private, and academic organizations a new transformative hydrologic forecasting modeling infrastructure has been developed. How was it possible to go from deterministic hydrologic forecasts largely driven through manual interactions at 3600 stations to automated 15-day ensemble forecasts at 2.67 million stations?\nEarth observations of precipitation, temperature, moisture, and other atmospheric and land surface conditions form the foundation of global hydrologic forecasts, but this project demonstrates a critical component to harness these resources can be summed up in one word: OPEN. Whether it is open data sources, open software solutions with open standards, or just being open to collaborations and building teams across institutions, disciplines, and international boundaries, time and time again through my involvement in the development of a high-resolution real time global hydrologic forecasting model I have discovered that in every aspect the sum has always been greater than the parts. While much has been accomplished, much more remains to be done, but the most important lesson learned has been to the degree that we can remain open and work together, the greater our ability will be to use big data hydrologic modeling resources to solve the world’s most vexing water related challenges.\nThis presentation will demonstrate a transformational global real time hydrologic forecasting application based on downscaled ECMWF ensemble forecasts, RAPID routing, and Tethys Platform for cloud computing and visualization with discussions of the human and cyber infrastructure connections that make it successful and needs moving forward.",

            "abstract": "Breaking surface waves generate layers of bubble clouds as air parcels entrain into the upper-ocean by the action of turbulent motions. The turbulent diffusivity in the bubble cloud layer was investigated by combining measurements of surface winds, waves, bubble acoustic backscatter, currents, and hydrography. These measurements were made at water depths of 60-90 m on the shelf of the Gulf of Alaska near Kayak Island during late December 2012, a period where the ocean was experiencing winds and significant wave heights up to 22 m s-1 and 9 m, respectively. Vertical profiles of acoustic backscatter decayed exponentially from the wave surface with e-folding lengths of about 0.6 to 6 m, while the bubble penetration depths were about 3 to 30 m. Both e-folding lengths and bubble depths were highly correlated with surface wind and wave conditions. The turbulent diffusion coefficients, inferred from e-folding length and bubble depth, varied from about 0.01 m2 s-1 to 0.4 m2 s-1. Our analysis suggests that the turbulent diffusivity in the bubble layer can be parameterized as a function of the cube of the wind friction velocity with a proportionality coefficient that depends weakly on wave age. Furthermore, in the bubble layer, on average, the shear production of the turbulent kinetic energy estimated by the diffusion coefficients was a similar order magnitude as the dissipation rate predicted by the wall boundary-layer theory.",

Such archives from Santa Barbara Basin, California record the ecological consequences to seafloor ecosystems of climate-forced shifts in the California Current Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). Here we use core MV0508-20JPC dated to 735,000±5,000 years ago (Marine Isotope Stage 18) as a “floating window” of millennial-scale ecological variability. For this investigation, previously published archives of planktonic δ18O (Globigerina bulloides) record stadial and interstadial oscillations in surface ocean temperature. Core MV0508-20JPC is an intermittently laminated archive, strongly influenced by the California Current OMZ, with continuously preserved benthic foraminifera and discontinuously preserved micro-invertebrates, including ophiuroids, echinoderms, ostracods, gastropods, bivalves and scaphopods. Multivariate statistical approaches, such as ordinations and cluster analyses, describe climate-driven changes in both foraminiferal and micro-invertebrate assemblages. Statistical ordinations illustrate that the shallow continental margin seafloor underwent predictable phase-shifts in oxygenation and biodiversity across stadial and interstadial events. A narrow suite of severely hypoxic taxa characterized foraminiferal communities from laminated intervals, including Bolivina tumida, Globobulimina spp., and Nonionella stella. Foraminiferal communities from bioturbated intervals are diverse and >60% similar to each other, and they are associated with echinoderm, ostracod and mollusc fossils. As with climate shifts in the latest Quaternary, there is a sensitive benthic ecosystem response in mid-Pleistocene continental margins to climatically related changes in OMZ strength.",

            "abstract": "Thanks to their ability to synthesize a wide variety of meteorological data and “produce data where there are none”, nowhere are global atmospheric reanalyses more needed than over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, where long-term records are few and far between. At the same time, because of the reduced observational constraint, nowhere else do reanalyses face more challenges, which can significantly reduce the reliability of their products. Most notably, the transition into the modern satellite era in 1979 greatly affected the skill of the NCEP-NCAR and ERA-40 reanalyses and explains why most reanalysis-based investigations of Antarctic climate change have since focused on the post-1979 period. The most recent generation of reanalyses has benefited from advances in numerical weather prediction, data rescue/quality-control and lessons learned from previous projects, all of which have improved their overall quality in the southern polar region. Alongside comprehensive reanalyses, recent data assimilation experiments using only surface or conventional observations have tried to overcome the 1979 “barrier”, but other problems have become apparent, including the necessity to specify realistic ocean boundary conditions (sea ice, SST) around Antarctica prior to 1979. The presentation will provide an overview of the skill of recent global reanalyses in high southern latitudes from the 1900s onward. It will discuss how far back in time we can reasonably go and in what areas caution is needed. The datasets covered will include ERA-Interim, CFSR, MERRA, and JRA-55, as well as recent century-long efforts, 20CR and ERA-20C.",

            "abstract": "The Glass Mountain obsidians (Long Valley, CA) are crystal-poor (<8%) and highly-evolved (high SiO2, low MgO, Sr, Ba) and, therefore, their formation required extremely efficient crystal-liquid separation. Petrologic and experimental investigation of the mineral phases in Glass Mountain lavas may reveal differentiation processes that generated the obsidians, if the mineral assemblage is phenocrystic. Results of high-resolution SEM mapping and electron microprobe analysis of a Glass Mountain sample reveal that the obsidian is saturated in nine phases (sanidine + quartz + plagioclase + ilmenite + titanomagnetite + zircon + apatite + allanite + biotite). Sanidine (Or78-Or35) and quartz occur in the largest abundances, and plagioclase (<An20) is the third most abundant. Sanidine crystals have a “granophyric” texture, marked by intergrowths of quartz and sanidine. H2O-saturated phase equilibrium experiments conducted in cold-seal pressure vessels conducted over a range of conditions (700-850°C; 75-225MPa) show that mineral phases in the natural sample are plausible phenocrysts with compositions that record degassing ± cooling. A surprising result from the phase equilibrium experiments is that, though phenocrysts from the natural sample reflect equilibrium compositions, they do not reflect equilibrium abundances. The low crystallinity, saturation in multiple phases, “granophyric” texture in sanidine, and glassy nature of the obsidians, requires that the mechanism that produced these obsidians have an associated kinetic effect that strongly hinders nucleation. Decompression and cooling experiments, conducted in this study and from the literature, demonstrate that the simplest way to hinder nucleation is to initiate degassing or cooling from super-liquidus conditions. Therefore, the Glass Mountain obsidians were super-heated prior to crystallization, achieved either by fluid under-saturated decompression from a crystalline mush or H2O-saturated partial melting.",

            "abstract": "Human demand for crop production is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades as a result of population growth, richer diets and biofuel use. In order for food production to keep pace, unprecedented amounts of resources – water, fertilizers, energy – will be required. This has led to calls for ‘sustainable intensification’ in which yields are increased on existing croplands while seeking to minimize impacts on water and other agricultural resources. Recent studies have quantified aspects of this, showing that there is a large potential to improve crop yields and increase harvest frequencies to better meet human demand. Though promising, both solutions would necessitate large additional inputs of water and fertilizer in order to be achieved under current technologies. However, the question of whether the current distribution of crops is, in fact, the best for realizing maximized production has not been considered to date.\nTo this end, we ask: Is it possible to increase calorie production and minimize water demand by simply growing crops where soil and climate conditions are best suited? Here we use maps of agro-ecological suitability – a measure of physical and chemical soil fertility – for 15 major food crops to identify differences between current crop distributions and where they can most suitably be planted. By redistributing crops across currently cultivated lands, we determine the potential improvement in calorie production as well as the associated change in water demand. We also consider what distribution of crops would maintain current calorie production while minimizing crop water demand. In doing all of this, our study provides a novel tool for improving crop calorie production without necessarily increasing resource demands.",

Model products were aggregated over sounder footprints corresponding to 13 km in LEO, 2 km in LEO, and 5 km in GEO sampled every 72 minutes. We simulated radiances for instruments with AIRS-like spectral coverage, spectral resolution, and channel noise, using these aggregated products as the truth, and analyzed them using a slightly modified version of the operational AIRS Version-6 retrieval algorithm. Spatial coverage and accuracy of retrievals as compared to model truth averaged over the appropriate footprint sizes are shown for all three sounding scenarios. Retrieval accuracies of all experiments, as compared to model truth averaged over the appropriate spatial resolution of the instruments, were similar to each other, and indeed were similar to what is typically obtained using observed AIRS data. Much more significantly, however, was that both the spatial structure and spatial coverage of Quality Controlled retrievals improved dramatically with increase in spatial resolution, first from 13 km to 5 km, and even more so from 5 km to 2 km. This demonstrates the desirability of flying high spatial resolution AIRS-like sounders on future LEO and GEO satellite missions.",

            "abstract": "Lidar remote sensing is widely applied for mapping forest carbon stocks, and technological advances have improved our ability to capture structural details from forests, even resolving individual trees. Despite these advancements, the accuracy of forest aboveground biomass models remains limited by the quality of field estimates of biomass. The accuracies of field estimates are inherently dependent on the accuracy of the allometric equations used to relate measurable attributes to biomass. These equations are calibrated with relatively small samples of often spatially clustered trees. This research focuses on one of many issues involving allometric equations - understanding how sensitive allometric parameters are to the sample sizes used to fit them. We capitalize on recent advances in lidar remote sensing to extract individual tree structural information from six high-resolution airborne lidar datasets in the United States. We remotely measure millions of tree heights and crown radii, and fit allometric equations to the relationship between tree height and radius at a ‘population’ level, in each site. We then extract samples from our tree database, and build allometries on these smaller samples of trees, with varying sample sizes. We show that for the allometric relationship between tree height and crown radius, small sample sizes produce biased allometric equations that overestimate height for a given crown radius. We extend this analysis using translations from the literature to address potential implications for biomass, showing that site-level biomass may be greatly overestimated when applying allometric equations developed with the typically small sample sizes used in popular allometric equations for biomass.",

            "abstract": "Processes acting in nascent volcanic clouds within seconds to hours of eruption (e.g., ash aggregation, ice nucleation, gravity waves) set the stage for subsequent advection and diffusion of volcanic ash, hence strongly influence aviation hazards and atmospheric impacts, but are very difficult to observe. Young plumes initially spread by gravity in the crosswind direction due to density differences with the surrounding stratified atmosphere. Subsequently, plumes lose their density contrast with the atmosphere and are advected as lenses of aerosol and gas, slowly thinning, spreading and dispersing as shearing and small scale turbulence act at their margins, and as fine ash settles out. Since 2006, satellite observations from NASA’s A-Train constellation, including the CALIOP lidar and CloudSat radar, have provided tantalizing glimpses of young volcanic clouds in the first few hours of atmospheric residence. These unique observations, although spatially limited, provide insight into the evolving structure of young volcanic clouds from an optically thick, vertically extensive initial state to thin layers confined to a limited altitude range. Layered volcanic clouds may develop due to the existence of alternating turbulent and stable layers in the free troposphere and stratosphere. Turbulent layers retain particles longer than do quiescent layers because the turbulence retains particles in suspension. Particles fall more rapidly through the quiescent layers by single particle settling, or more rapidly because of convective sedimentation. The result is a distinct, banded ash cloud structure. We present A-Train satellite observations of volcanic clouds at various stages of evolution from several recent eruptions (including Kelut, Redoubt, Chaitén, Eyjafjallajökull, Okmok and Kasatochi) and also show the results of preliminary model simulations of the development of volcanic cloud layering.",

Nyiragongo’s foiditic lavas are some of the most silica-undersaturated on earth, whereas the highly effusive Nyamulagira erupts primarily basanites and tephrites. To determine the extent and scale of mantle heterogeneities and gain insight into the magmatic sources beneath this portion of the East African Rift, we have measured Hf and Pb isotope compositions for 43 samples from Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira. The Nd and Sr isotope data for the same sample dissolutions are forthcoming.\nNyiragongo lavas are clearly distinct from Nyamulagira lavas in terms of their Hf and Pb isotope compositions, suggesting that a long-lived and small-scale heterogeneous mantle source exists beneath these two volcanoes.

(2009, Chem Geol 259) measured bulk silicate earth-like Nd and Sr isotope compositions for Nyiragongo lavas and proposed a primitive mantle/bulk-earth plume source for this volcano. Our new Hf isotope compositions for Nyiragongo, however, are higher than bulk silicate earth, suggesting a more depleted source for these highly alkaline lavas. We also note that the He isotope compositions of olivine and clinopyroxene from Nyiragongo lavas (R/Ra = 6.7-8.5; Pik et al., 2006, Chem Geol 226; Tedesco et al., 2010, J Geophys Res 115) are inconsistent with a long-term bulk silicate earth-like source.",

These applications typically re-grid the precipitation rates to lower resolutions or average them over specific domains. Such a modification of scale will impact the reliability of IMERG. In this study, the performance of IMERG is evaluated against ground-based measurements as a function of increasing spatial resolution and accumulation periods.\nThe focus of this study is the Final run of IMERG, which is derived from a constellation of satellites with monthly gauge adjustment. For ground truth, the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Stage III product, a radar- and gauge-based operational precipitation product over the US, is used. The analysis is restricted to a region in which MRMS is highly reliable due to good radar coverage, wherein IMERG is compared to MRMS averaged over boxes of increasing size and accumulation, starting from 0.1° at 1 h. TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) is also included as a benchmark.\nIn general, IMERG expectedly performs better with increasing spatial and temporal scale, with higher correlations, lower error values and better identification of rain events. IMERG also outperforms TMPA most of the time. These results will serve as a reference for users of IMERG on its reliability over the scales relevant to their studies.",

Since its construction the debates on its environmental and climatic impacts have never stopped, especially after the extreme drought and flood in Yangtze River Basin these years. TGP reached its final impounding water level in 2010. However, studies on systematically monitoring the long-term variations in surface and atmospheric parameters in TGRA are still lacking. In this study, three important surface parameters – surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET) and two climatic parameters – air temperature and precipitation were investigated from 2000 to 2013 by combining multiple remote sensing data and ground measurements. Results showed that along the reservoir albedo decreased significantly as a result of water impounding. Correspondingly, in the same region daytime LST decreased in spring and summer and nighttime LST increased in autumn and winter. In the western region of TGRA, albedo increased due to resettlement and LST also changed. The average ET increased by 20% in TGR but kept stable in the whole TGRA. In contrast to LST, air temperature showed less apparent spatial and temporal variability. Only in the region near the dam air temperature experienced a decrease at daytime and an increase at nighttime. Further analysis demonstrated precipitation revealed no apparent changes in TGRA and the precipitation anomaly in northwest of TGRA may not be connected with TGP. All of the findings provide a more substantial clues of local climate change caused by TGP.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of viscosity of polymer structure liquids with varying composition and/or conditions (temperature, pressure) is important in wide range of scientific and engineering areas including Earth science. For example, strong change in viscosity of polymerized silicate melt is of interests in discussing migration of magma in the Earth’s interior and volcanic activity near surface. However, our understanding particularly for influence of pressure on viscosity and structure of polymer structure liquids remains poor. Here we show pressure and temperature dependence of viscosities of polymer structure liquids sulfur and selenium. Viscosity of liquid sulfur strongly decreases with increasing temperature, while it less depends on pressure. Similarly to viscosity, structure of liquid sulfur shows strong decrease of chain length with increasing temperature, while it is almost constant with varying pressure. This data imply that viscosity of liquid sulfur is mainly controlled by chain length. On the other hand, viscosity of liquid selenium strongly decreases with increase of both pressure and temperature. Structure measurement shows that liquid selenium forms new inter-chain bonding at high pressures and high temperatures, which may be the cause of viscosity decrease at high pressures and high temperatures. Similar structure changes such as polymer length change due to change of non-bridging oxygen and/or formation of tri-cluster have been identified in silicate melt with varying composition, pressure, and /or temperature. The viscosity-structure correlation obtained in liquid sulfur and selenium would provide important knowledge in understanding nature of silicate melt at high pressures.",

This severely limits the parameters that you can estimate.

We study the impact of of errors in the various models used to calculate the theoretical delay on the estimate of UT1. The models we examined include polar motion, troposphere, atmospheric gradients, station position, etc. If an error in a particular model results in a large change in UT1 than we must be particularly careful that this model is accurate. Conversely, if the change in UT1 is small, then we don't need to be as carefull. We also discuss alternative estimation strategies as a way of improving the accuracy of UT1.",

Here we apply a newly developed technique (Yu et al., 2015; doi: 10.1002/2014JB011610) to effectively remove or reduce the reverberations from the sedimentary layer to obtain more reliable results. Stacking of a total of 38528 radial RFs recorded by 343 stations in the study area shows systematic spatial variations in crustal thickness (H), Vp/Vs ratio and amplitude (R; relative to the direction P) of the converted Moho phases. Our results indicate that the upper Mississippi Embayment (ME), a broad southwest-plunging trough with the thickest sedimentary layer in the study area, is characterized by a thin crustal thickness (~32 km), while adjacent areas have relatively thicker crust (>40 km). This area also possesses relatively large Vp/Vs (>1.85) values, suggesting possible intrusion of mantle-derived mafic rocks. Most part of the Ozark Uplift is characterized by relatively small Vp/Vs (<1.79) values which indicate an overall felsic crust. In contrast to the NMSZ which is part of the Reelfoot rift, the southern Illinois Basin, which is an intracontinental sag basin, is characterized by a crust of about 45 km which is a few km thicker than the surrounding areas, and a normal Vp/Vs, suggesting sharp differences in crustal structure between rift and sag basins.",

            "abstract": "Following the M7.8 Gorhka, Nepal, earthquake of April 25, 2015 the USGS issued a series of aftershock forecasts. The initial impetus for these forecasts was a request from the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance to support their Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) which coordinated US Government disaster response, including search and rescue, with the Government of Nepal. Because of the possible utility of the forecasts to people in the region and other response teams, the USGS released these forecasts publicly through the USGS Earthquake Program web site. The initial forecast used the Reasenberg and Jones (Science, 1989) model with generic parameters developed for active deep continental regions based on the Garcia et al. (BSSA, 2012) tectonic regionalization. These were then updated to reflect a lower productivity and higher decay rate based on the observed aftershocks, although relying on teleseismic observations, with a high magnitude-of-completeness, limited the amount of data. After the 12 May M7.3 aftershock, the forecasts used an Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model to better characterize the multiple sources of earthquake clustering. This model provided better estimates of aftershock uncertainty. These forecast messages were crafted based on lessons learned from the Christchurch earthquake along with input from the U.S. Embassy staff in Kathmandu. Challenges included how to balance simple messaging with forecasts over a variety of time periods (week, month, and year), whether to characterize probabilities with words such as those suggested by the IPCC (IPCC, 2010), how to word the messages in a way that would translate accurately into Nepali and not alarm the public, and how to present the probabilities of unlikely but possible large and potentially damaging aftershocks, such as the M7.3 event, which had an estimated probability of only 1-in-200 for the week in which it occurred.",

            "abstract": "he Boone River Watershed (BRW) is an intensively cropped region dominated by corn and soybean production that covers over 237,000 ha in north central Iowa. The BRW is reflective of both current Iowa cropping trends and elevated levels of nutrient pollution in streams. Nitrate losses are of particular concern, much of which escapes the cropland via subsurface tiles that drain the predominantly flat landscapes that characterize the watershed. Phosphorus export to stream systems in the BRW is also a problem of considerable concern. Questions have emerged as to the possible impacts of adopting cellulosic biofuel production systems in Iowa watersheds such as the BRW, which would be developed as function of corn stover removed after harvest or via the introduction of perennial biofuel crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. In response, a modeling system been constructed for the watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to address biofuel-related water quality and related issues. The specific version of SWAT (SWAT version 2012; Release 615) that is being used in the study features recent modifications made to the source code that corrected inaccuracies in previous codes in regards to simulating removal of corn stover and also the growth of switchgrass and miscanthus. In addition, updated crop growth parameters that more accurately represent the biomass production potential of switchgrass and miscanthus varieties being grown in the U.S. Corn Belt region are being used in this SWAT modeling system. The results of several scenarios are reported here that reflect future cellulosic biofuel scenarios based on 20%, 30% or 50% removal levels of corn stover or widespread adoption of switchgrass and/or miscanthus across much or all of the BRW. Both hydrologic and pollutant loss (sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus) losses are reported for all of the simulated scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Evidence of West-Antarctic-style Pliocene deglaciation of the East Antarctic Wilkes and Aurora marine basins is accumulating in the published literature. The far-field sea-level record seems to require an East Antarctic contribution, enhanced geophysical surveys show deep and wide channels that deglaciate under appropriate forcing in at least some models, and Pliocene ice-rafted debris pulses of appropriate age and source region indicate ice-shelf loss that would have caused loss of at least some grounded ice. Modeled rates of East Antarctic ice-sheet shrinkage are generally slower than peak possible West Antarctic behavior, but the ~14 m of Pliocene sea-level rise from East Antarctica in our modeling is large compared to West Antarctic sources.\nIn an effort led by RPS with modeling by RMD and DP, we argue that the Pliocene diatoms of the Sirius Group tillites in the Transantarctic Mountains, the subject of a decade-long debate between “stabilists” and “dynamicists”, record the Pliocene deglaciation of the marine basins, and thus further confirm large East Antarctic response to moderate forcing. An extensive literature has established that the Sirius tills are local deposits that predate the Pliocene, with wind-blown Pliocene diatoms mixed into the upper layers. The modern eolian flux contains few marine diatoms compared to non-marine; thus, the marine-diatom-dominated Sirius deposits imply a distinct source that is not available today. In our recently published modeling, the deglaciation of the East Antarctic basins in response to warm Pliocene conditions is followed by marine incursion that by analogy with modern conditions would have been highly productive of diatoms, and delayed isostatic uplift then raises large areas of the resulting marine sediments above sea level. New modeling indicates that diatoms lifted in storms from these marine sediments would have been directly and rapidly transported to the Sirius sites, where the warmer Pliocene conditions would have favored cryoturbation, allowing integration of eolian diatoms into the porous till surface. The new modeling results permit a successful synthesis and integration of opposing viewpoints in the Sirius debate, and has possible implications for sea levels in a world warmed above Pliocene levels by human forcing.",

            "abstract": "Induced earthquakes in the central United States pose a risk to local populations, but there is not yet agreement on how to portray their hazard. A large source of uncertainty in the hazard arises from ground motion prediction, which depends on the magnitude and distance of the causative earthquake. However, ground motion models for induced earthquakes may be very different than models previously developed for either the eastern or western United States. A key question is whether ground motions from induced earthquakes are similar to those from natural earthquakes, yet there is little history of natural events in the same region with which to compare the induced ground motions. To address these problems, we explore how earthquake source properties, such as stress drop or depth, affect the recorded ground motion of induced earthquakes. Typically, due to stress drop increasing with depth, ground motion prediction equations model shallower events to have smaller ground motions, when considering the same absolute hypocentral distance to the station. Induced earthquakes tend to occur at shallower depths, with respect to natural eastern US earthquakes, and may also exhibit lower stress drops, which begs the question of how these two parameters interact to control ground motion. Can the ground motions of induced earthquakes simply be understood by scaling our known source-ground motion relations to account for the shallow depth or potentially smaller stress drops of these induced earthquakes, or is there an inherently different mechanism in play for these induced earthquakes? We study peak ground-motion velocity (PGV) and acceleration (PGA) from induced earthquakes in Oklahoma and Kansas, recorded by USGS networks at source-station distances of less than 20 km, in order to model the source effects. We compare these records to those in both the NGA-West2 database (primarily from California) as well as NGA-East, which covers the central and eastern United States and Canada. Preliminary analysis indicates that the induced ground motions appear similar to those from the NGA-West2 database. However, upon consideration of their shallower depths, ground motion behavior from induced events seems to fall in between the West data and that of NGA-East, so we explore the control of stress drop and depth on ground motion in more detail.",

            "abstract": "Hazard evacuation planning requires robust modeling tools and techniques, such as least cost distance or agent-based modeling, to gain an understanding of a community’s potential to reach safety before event (e.g. tsunami) arrival. Least cost distance modeling provides a static view of the evacuation landscape with an estimate of travel times to safety from each location in the hazard space. With this information, practitioners can assess a community’s overall ability for timely evacuation. More information may be needed if evacuee congestion creates bottlenecks in the flow patterns. Dynamic movement patterns are best explored with agent-based models that simulate movement of and interaction between individual agents as evacuees through the hazard space, reacting to potential congestion areas along the evacuation route.\nThe multi-agent transport simulation model MATSim is an agent-based modeling framework that can be applied to hazard evacuation planning. Developed jointly by universities in Switzerland and Germany, MATSim is open-source software written in Java and freely available for modification or enhancement. We successfully used MATSim to illustrate tsunami evacuation challenges in two island communities in California, USA, that are impacted by limited escape routes. However, working with MATSim’s data preparation, simulation, and visualization modules in an integrated development environment requires a significant investment of time to develop the software expertise to link the modules and run a simulation. To facilitate our evacuation research, we packaged the MATSim modules into a single application tailored to the needs of the hazards community. By exposing the modeling parameters of interest to researchers in an intuitive user interface and hiding the software complexities, we bring agent-based modeling closer to practitioners and provide access to the powerful visual and analytic information that this modeling can provide.",

            "abstract": "Carbon monoxide, which is ubiquitous on Earth, is the 2nd most abundant molecule in the universe. Members of the domain Bacteria have long been known to oxidize it, and activities of CO oxidizers in soils have been known for several decades to contribute to tropospheric CO regulation. Nonetheless, the diversity of CO oxidizers and their evolutionary history remain largely unknown. A molybdenum-dependent dehydrogenase (Mo-CODH) couples CO oxidation by most terrestrial and marine bacteria to either O2 or nitrate. Molybdenum dependence, the requirement for O2 and previous phylogenetic inferences have all supported a relatively late evolution for \"aerobic\" CO oxidation, presumably after the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) about 2.3 Gya. Although conundrums remain, recent discoveries suggest that Mo-CODH might have evolved before the GOE, and prior to the Bacteria-Archaea split. New phylogenetic analyses incorporating sequences from extremely halophilic CO-oxidizing Euryarchaeota isolated from salterns in the Atacama Desert, brines on Hawai`i and from the Bonneville Salt Flat suggest that Mo-CODH was present in an ancestor shared by Bacteria and Archaea. This observation is consistent with results of phylogenetic histories of genes involved in Mo-cofactor synthesis, and findings by others that Mo-nitrogenase was likely active > 3 Gya. Thus, analyses of Mo-dependent CO oxidizers provide a window on the past by raising questions about the availability of Mo and non-O2 electron acceptors. Extremely halophilic CO oxidizers also provide insights relevant for understanding the potential for extraterrestrial life. CO likely occurred at high concentrations in Mars' early atmosphere, and it occurs presently at about 800 ppm. At such high concentrations, CO represents one of the most abundant energy sources available for near-surface regolith. However, use of CO by an extant or transplanted Mars microbiota would require tolerance of low water potentials and high salt concentrations. Assays with both novel isolates and a variety of saline brines, sediments and soils show that extreme halophiles use CO in solutions of saturated NaCl (5.4 M) and at water potentials as low as -118 MPa. The latter observations are consistent with metabolic activity for conditions inferred for the recurrent slope lineae on Mars.",

Due to their large size and power consumption these sensors have typically been deployed in fixed arrays, portable arrays have required trucks to transport the sensors and support equipment. A high performance, miniaturized, infrasound microphone has been developed to enable mobile infrasound measurements that would otherwise be impractical. The new device is slightly larger than a hockey puck, weighs 200g, and consumes less than 150mW. The sensitivity is 0.4V/Pa and self noise at 1Hz is less than 0.63µPa²/Hz. The characteristics were verified using a calibrator tracable to the Los Alamos calibration chamber. Field tests have demonstrated the performance is comparable to a Chaparral model 25.

Implicit time stepping methods provide a means to maintain accuracy while taking time steps commensurate with the physical processes of interest. We present results utilizing a second order implicit time stepping method in the hydrostatic spectral element dynamical core of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM-SE). Because this method can take much larger time steps and remain stable with measured accuracy, efficiency gains for some test cases and model configurations are realized, depending on the time scales of interest. The growth of linear iterations in the Newton-Krylov method for solving the nonlinear residual equation highlights the need for scalable preconditioning.

            "abstract": "Operational remote sensing of microphysical and optical cloud properties is invariably predicated on the assumption of plane-parallel slab geometry for the targeted cloud. The sole benefit of this often-questionable assumption about the cloud is that it leads to one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer (RT)---a textbook, computationally tractable model. We present new results as evidence that, thanks to converging advances in 3D RT, inverse problem theory, algorithm implementation, and computer hardware, we are at the dawn of a new era in cloud remote sensing where we can finally go beyond the plane-parallel paradigm.\nGranted, the plane-parallel/1D RT assumption is reasonable for spatially extended stratiform cloud layers, as well as the smoothly distributed background aerosol layers. However, these 1D RT-friendly scenarios exclude cases that are critically important for climate physics. 1D RT---whence operational cloud remote sensing---fails catastrophically for cumuliform clouds that have fully 3D outer shapes and internal structures driven by shallow or deep convection. For these situations, the first order of business in a robust characterization by remote sensing is to abandon the slab geometry framework and determine the 3D geometry of the cloud, as a first step toward bone fide 3D cloud tomography.\nWith this specific goal in mind, we deliver a proof-of-concept for an entirely new kind of remote sensing applicable to 3D clouds. It is based on highly simplified 3D RT and exploits multi-angular suites of cloud images at high spatial resolution. Airborne sensors like AirMSPI readily acquire such data. The key element of the reconstruction algorithm is a sophisticated solution of the nonlinear inverse problem via linearization of the forward model and an iteration scheme supported, where necessary, by adaptive regularization. Currently, the demo uses a 2D setting to show how either vertical profiles or horizontal slices of the cloud can be accurately reconstructed. Extension to 3D volumes is straightforward but the next challenge is to accommodate images at lower spatial resolution, e.g., from MISR/Terra.\nG. Bal, J. Chen, and A.B. Davis (2015).

            "abstract": "The predictability of polar climate is limited by uncertainties in the given forcing, the response to this forcing, and the internal variability of the fully coupled climate system. Given these factors, we estimate how anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) patterns can influence polar climate and ultimately impact ice sheets and polar feedbacks. Using different versions of NCAR Community Atmospheric Model (i.e. CAM3.1, CAM3.5, CAM4.0, CAM5.0), we assess the capabilities of multiple atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) to respond to SST forced changes by perturbing SST fields that influence polar climate via atmospheric teleconnections. By decomposing uncertainties, we are able to address the impact of structural differences in climate models.\nFrom large-ensembles of model simulations, we estimate the Global Teleconnection Operator (GTO) for each AGCM. The GTO is a linear approximation or empirical Green’s function and can be used to diagnose the sensitivities of polar climate to the boundary condition forcing from anomalous SSTs patterns. Primarily, the GTO identifies the ocean sectors where SST anomalies are effective at forcing polar climate response. To explore predictability issues, the multi-linear model is evaluated by comparing the linearly reconstructed response with both the results from the full non-linear coupled model and observations. We find that the multi-linear model can capture polar climate variability that the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations produce at seasonal scales for several polar regions in the near future. Overall, this approach provides a tool for exploring polar climate response as a first-order assessment of the climate variability being driven by SST forcings and the internal variability and model uncertainties by using large ensembles to estimate GTO. Furthermore, the uncertainty decomposition can help identify key directions where further research is required to improve predictive skill.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic material (SOM) can become light-absorbing (i.e. brown carbon) via multiphase reactions with nitrogen-containing species such as ammonia and amines. The physical states of SOM, however, potentially slow the diffusion of reactant molecules in organic matrix under conditions that semisolids or solids prevail, thus inhibiting the browning reaction pathways. In this study, the physical states and the in-particle diffusivity were investigated by measuring the evaporation kinetics of both water and organics from aromatic-derived SOMs using a quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM). The results indicate that the SOMs derived from aromatic precursors toluene and m-xylene became solid (glassy) and the in particle diffusion was significantly impeded for sufficiently low relative humidity ( < 20% RH) at 293 K. Optical properties and the AMS spectra were measured for toluene-derived SOM after ammonia exposure at varied RHs. The results suggest that the production of light-absorbing nitrogen-containing compounds from multiphase reactions with ammonia was kinetically limited in the glassy organic matrix, which otherwise produce brown carbon. The results of this study have significant implications for production and optical properties of brown carbon in urban atmospheres that ultimately influence the climate and tropospheric photochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Shallow-sea hydrothermal ecosystems are dynamic, high-energy systems influenced by sunlight and geothermal activity. They provide accessible opportunities for investigating thermophilic microbial biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we report biogeochemical data from a shallow-sea hydrothermal system offshore Paleochori Bay, Milos, Greece, which is characterized by a central vent covered by white microbial mats with hydrothermally influenced sediments extending into nearby sea grass area. Geochemical analysis and deep sequencing provide high-resolution information on the geochemical patterns, microbial diversity and metabolic potential in a two-meter transect.\nThe venting fluid is elevated in temperature (~70oC), low in pH (~4), and enriched in reduced species. The geochemical pattern shows that the profile is affected by not only seawater dilution but also microbial regulation. The microbial community in the deepest section of vent core (10-12 cm) is largely dominated by thermophilic archaea, including a methanogen and a recently described Crenarcheon. Mid-core (6-8 cm), the microbial community in the venting area switches to the hydrogen utilizer Aquificae. Near the sediment-water interface, anaerobic Firmicutes and Actinobacteria dominate, both of which are commonly associated with subsurface and hydrothermal sites. All other samples are dominated by diverse Proteobacteria. The sulfate profile is strongly correlated with the population size of delta- and episilon-proteobactia. The dramatic decrease in concentrations of As and Mn in pore fluids as a function of distance from the vent suggests that in addition to seawater dilution, microorganisms are likely transforming these and other ions through a combination of detoxification and catabolism. In addition, high concentrations of dissolved Fe are only measurable in the shallow sea grass area, suggesting that iron-transforming microorganisms are controlling Fe mobility, and promoting biomineralization.\nTaken together, these samples represent the effects of submarine venting on sediment microbial communities both vertically and horizontally in the predicted fluid flow path, and will provide a detailed investigation of genetic potential for biogeochemical cycling at Paleochori Bay.",

We present examples, design patterns and best practices as an evolving body of knowledge that help optimize benefit to the research team.

(2) How to explore, compare and evaluate cost and compute power from many cloud options, particularly in relation to data scale (size/complexity). (3) What are simple / fast 'Lightweight Data System' procedures that take from 20 minutes to one day to implement and that have a clear immediate payoff in environmental data-driven research.

            "abstract": "Woody encroachment is a pervasive land cover change throughout the tropics and subtropics. Encroachment is frequently catalyzed by nitrogen (N)-fixing trees and the resulting N inputs potentially alter whole-ecosystem N cycling, accumulation and loss. In the southern US, widespread encroachment by legume Prosopis glandulosa is associated with increased soil total N storage, inorganic N concentrations, and net mineralization and nitrification rates.\nTo better understand the effects of this process on ecosystem N cycling, we investigated patterns of symbiotic N fixation, N accrual and soil N trace gas and N2 emissions during Prosopis encroachment into the southern Rio Grande Plains. Analyses of d15N in foliage, xylem sap and plant-available soil N suggested that N fixation rates increase with tree age and are influenced by abiotic conditions. A model of soil N accrual around individual trees, accounting for atmospheric inputs and gas losses, generates lifetimes N fixation estimates of up to 9 kg for a 100-year-old tree and current rates of 7 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, these N inputs and increased soil cycling rates do not translate into increased N gas losses. Two years of field measurements of a complete suite of N trace gases (ammonia, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and other oxidized N compounds) found no difference in flux between upland Prosopis groves and adjacent unencroached grasslands. Total emissions for both land cover types average 0.56-0.65 kg N ha-1 yr-1, comparable to other southern US grasslands. Additional lab experiments suggested that N2 losses are low and that field oxygen conditions are not usually conducive to denitrification. Taken together, results suggest that this ecosystem is currently experiencing a period of net N accrual under ongoing encroachment.",

            "abstract": "Seismological studies using land and ocean bottom seismographs can image velocity anomalies resulting from the presence of melt, fluids, and hydrated minerals in arc and backarc systems. The largest uncertainty in subduction zone water inputs derives from the lack of constraints on hydration of the incoming oceanic mantle. Results from several subduction zones show reduced mantle seismic velocities associated with extensional faulting as the incoming plate bends, suggesting up to 30% uppermost mantle serpentinization associated with water flow through faults. Extensional earthquakes occur to depths of about 15 km below the Moho at most subduction zones, suggesting the water storage capacity of the subducting uppermost mantle may be much larger than previously thought.\nIsland arc systems with active backarc spreading centers offer an opportunity to image mantle wedge processes and compare with geochemical and petrological outputs. In Mariana, mantle seismic anomalies associated with arc and backarc melting are separated by a high velocity, low attenuation region at shallow depths (< 80 km), implying distinct arc and backarc melting regions, with the anomalies coalescing at greater depths. The maximum anomaly in the backarc is shallower (~ 30 km) than in the arc (~ 60 km), consistent with final equilibrium depths estimated from basalt thermobarometry. In the Lau basin the slow anomaly beneath the spreading center is displaced westward with greater depths, suggesting that partial melting occurs along an upwelling limb of mantle flow originating west of the backarc. The observed Lau backarc anomalies are roughly inversely proportional to inferred mantle water content, suggesting that water reduces the melt porosity. Water may increase the efficiency of melt transport and reduce porosity by lowering the melt viscosity, increasing grain size through faster grain growth, or by causing a different topology of melt within the mantle rock. A lower melt porosity for aqueous melts is also consistent with the smaller amplitude seismic anomaly seen for the water-rich volcanic arc melting regions compared to the backarc melt production zone.",

However, over-reliance on groundwater has caused plummeting groundwater levels in much of the state's heavily agricultural regions, with annual groundwater overdraft state-wide estimated in the millions of acre-feet per year. Prior to 2015, California water law did not allow for the effective monitoring or assessment of groundwater use; passage of new state regulations will require development of locally-managed plans that, for the first time, require comprehensive groundwater management and groundwater basin sustainability. Because these plans are not required to be implemented for another 25 years, groundwater levels will likely continue to decrease. Some communities that are 100-percent reliant on groundwater as a source of municipal supply may face shortages and supply issues, which may exacerbate known water quality concerns. Examination of community water systems that are reliant on groundwater, their existing water quality issues, and their response to the current drought (through existing mandatory conservation requirements imposed by California state regulators) can identify areas that are particularly susceptible to continued groundwater overdraft.",

All model integrations span 41 years in the historic period (1965-2005) and 41 years in the near-term future period (2010-2050) under RCP 8.5. The RegCM4 domain covers the continental U.S. and parts of Canada and Mexico at 18-km horizontal grid spacing whereas the VIC domain covers only the continental U.S. at 4-km horizontal grid spacing. Should the emissions continue to rise throughout the next four decades of the 21st century, our results suggest that every region within the continental U.S. will be at least 2°C warmer before the mid-21st century, leading to the likely intensification of the regional hydrological cycle and the acceleration of the observed trends in the cold, warm and wet extremes. We also find an overall increase (decrease) in the inflows to the flood-controlling (hydroelectric) reservoirs across the United States, raising the likelihood of flooding events and significant impacts on the federal hydroelectric power generation. However, certain water-stressed regions such as California will be further constrained by extreme dry and wet conditions; these regions are incapable of storing rising quantities of runoff and wet years will not necessarily equate to an increase in water supply availability. Overall, these changes in the regional hydro-meteorology can have substantial impacts on the natural and human systems across the U.S.",

            "abstract": "The formation of the core via percolation is an attractive pocess to form planetary cores early in the planets evolution. Even magma ocean scenarios require percolation of the iron-sulfide melt through underlying silicate cumulates. There is currently a debate whether the dihedral angle of iron-sulphide melts in an olivine matrix is low enough to allow the formation of a percolating network. We present first computations of equilibrium melt distributions in realistic irregular grains and show that the percolation threshold at dihedral angles above 60 degrees is significantly larger than those previously reported for simple geometries. This explains why the percolation cut-off at 60 degress is such an effective barrier to porous flow at low porosities. However, given typical compositions of the terrestrial planets initial porosites after the onset of melting of iron are large, 20-40%, and likely to overcome the precolation threshold to form a connected melt network. As the porosity decreases due to melt segregation the network remains connected and allows core formation by porous flow. Only as the porosites approach 1% does the network snapp-off and the iron become isolated in pockets along triple junctions. This residual iron may provide an explanation for the formation of dense layers near the core mantle boundary such as D”.",

            "abstract": "While aerosol forecasting has its own host of aerosol source, sink and microphysical challenges to overcome, ultimately any numerical weather prediction based aerosol model can be no better than its underlying meteorology. However, the scorecard elements that drive NWP model development have varying relationships to the key uncertainties and biases that are of greatest concern to aerosol forecasting. Here we provide opinions from member developers of the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) on NWP deficiencies related to multi-specie aerosol forecasting, as well as relevance of current NWP scorecard elements to aerosol forecasting. Comparisons to field mission data to simulations are used to demonstrate these opinions and show how shortcomings in individual processes in the global models cascade into aerosol prediction. While a number of sensitivities will be outlined, as one would expect, the most important processes relate to aerosol sources, sinks and, in the context of data assimilation, aerosol hygroscopicity. Thus, the pressing needs in the global models relate to boundary layer and convective processes in the context of large scale waves. Examples will be derived from tropical to polar field measurements, from simpler to more complex including a) network data on dust emissions and transport from Saharan Africa, b) boundary layer development, instability, and deep convection in the United States during Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS); and c) 7 Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) data on aerosol influences by maritime convection up-scaled through tropical waves. While the focus of this talk is how improved meteorological model processes are important to aerosol modeling, we conclude with recent findings of the Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) which demonstrate how aerosol processes may be important to global model simulations of polar cloud, surface energy and subsequently sea ice budgets. Combined, these field observations demonstrate the importance of global model processes from micro to seasonal scales and tropical to polar climates.",

            "abstract": "A major benefit of participation in research networks such as the Long Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network is that multidisciplinary research on a broad range of topics is facilitated. The interaction between the Agricultural Research Service long-term experimental watersheds and LTAR exemplifies this. At the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), this is further enhanced by participation in the Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network. The RCEW has a long history (55 years) of experimentation, modeling and monitoring emphasizing hydrologic processes, which are inevitably related to biogeochemical processes, but rarely linked directly in RCEW research. New research with the Reynolds Creek CZO (RC CZO) emphasizes biogeochemistry. The background research and infrastructure at the RCEW provides an ideal platform for that research. At the same time, RC CZO products are enabling ARS to extend its research activities. We highlight three examples: (i) forcing data sets used to facilitate physical modeling of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes, (ii) linkage of hydrology and geophyscis to extend our understanding of subsurface processes, and (iii) climate/elevation linkages to ecosystem productivity, which are closely related in water limited environments such as the RCEW. The addition of the RCEW to the LTAR is further extended ARS capabilities. For example, the RCEW is now monitoring net carbon balance and productivity at sites along an elevation/climatic gradient. The addition of LTAR research enhances that work by extending the climate gradient and introducing management and land surface change effects. We anticipate that these interactions will grow and that cross-site experiments will be initiated as the results begin to accumulate.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater contamination by trichloroethene (TCE) poses a threat to health and leads to the generation of vinyl chloride (VC), a carcinogen. Dehalococcoides mccartyi is the only bacterium that can completely dechlorinate TCE to ethene (C2H4). Acetylene (C2H2) occurs in TCE-contaminated sites as a consequence of chemical degradation of TCE. Yet acetylene inhibits a variety of microbial processes including methanogesis and reductive dechlorination. Pelobacter acetylenicus and related species can metabolize acetylene via acetylene hydratase and acetaldehyde dismutatse thereby generating acetate and H2 as endproducts, which could serve as electron donor and carbon source for growth of D. mccartyi.\nWe found that 1mM acetylene (aqueous) inhibits growth of D. mccartyi strain 195 on 0.3 mM TCE, but that the inhibition was removed after 12 days with the addition of an acetylene-utilizing isolate from San Francisco Bay, Pelobacter strain SFB93. TCE did not inhibit the growth of this Pelobacter at the concentrations tested (0.1-0.5 mM) and TCE was not consumed by strain SFB93. Co-cultures of strain 195 with strain SFB93 at 5% inoculation were established in 120 mL serum bottles containing 40 mL defined medium. TCE was supplied at a liquid concentration of 0.1 mM, with 0.1 mM acetylene and N2/CO2 (90:10 v/v) headspace at 34 °C. Co-cultures were subsequently transferred (5% vol/vol inoculation) to generate subcultures after 20 µmol TCE was reduced to VC and 36 µmol acetylene was depleted. Aqueous H2 ranged from 114 to 217 nM during TCE-dechlorination, and the cell yield of strain 195 was 3.7 ±0.3 × 107 cells µmol-1 Cl- released. In a D. mccartyi-containing enrichment culture (ANAS) under the same conditions as above, it was found that inhibition of dechlorination by acetylene was reversed after 19 days by adding SFB93.\nThus we showed that a co-culture of Pelobacter SFB93 and D. mccartyi 195 could be maintained with C2H2 as the electron donor and carbon source while TCE served as the electron acceptor. Inhibition by C2H2 of reductive dechlorination in both the D. mccartyi isolate and the enrichment culture ANAS were observed, but the inhibition was eliminated by adding Pelobacter SFB93 to the cultures. These results will help facilitate the optimization of TCE-bioremediation at contaminated sites containing both TCE and C2H2.",

            "abstract": "Landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a crucial role in the climate of the US Pacific coast region as they are frequently related with heavy precipitation and flash flooding events. Thus, the capability of climate models to accurately simulate AR landfalls and their key hydrologic effects is an important practical concern for WUS, from flood forecasting to future water resources projections.\nIn order to examine the effects of model configuration, including the resolution and spectral nudging, in simulating the climatology of key weather events in the conterminous US, a NASA team has performed a hindcast experiment using the GEOS5 global and the NU-WRF regional models for Nov 1999 - Oct 2010. This study examines the skill of these hindcasts, with different models and their configurations, in simulating key footprints of landfalling ARs in the WUS region. Using an AR-landfall chronology based on the vertically-integrated water vapor flux calculated from the MERRA2 reanalysis, we have analyzed the observed and simulated precipitation and temperature anomalies associated with wintertime AR landfalls along the US Pacific coast. Model skill is measured using metrics including regional means, a skill score based on correlations and mean-square errors, and Taylor diagrams in four WUS Bukovsky regions. Results show that the AR-related anomalies of precipitation is more reliable than of surface temperatures. Model skill also varies according to regions. The AR temperature anomalies are well simulated in most of the WUS region except PNW. For precipitation, simulations with finer spatial resolution tend to generate larger spatial variability and agree better with the PRISM data in most regions. Such a resolution dependence of spatial variability is not found for temperatures; e.g., the MERRA2 reanalysis often outperforms, with similar spatial variability and higher pattern correlations with the PRISM data, finer-resolution NU-WRF runs in simulating temperature variations within subregions. Results from this study will be summarized to assist future (regional) climate experiments for climate change impact assessments and developing adaptation/mitigation strategies, the key elements of the National Climate Assessment.",

Observation based estimates showed significant changes in phytoplankton biomass in the last few decades; and climate models also project a reduced marine primary production and shifts in the plankton community structure in the future climate. Here we investigate the contribution of individual phytoplankton functional groups to the DMS production and fluxes to the atmosphere using the improved marine ecosystem-biogeochemical module of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We will examine the impacts of shifts in phytoplankton community composition on DMS distributions in a RCP climate scenario.

In late 2014 aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s RV Falkor, we mapped, albeit incompletely, the Canyon for the first time, revealing that it is both the longest (>700 km) and the most voluminous (>6800 km3) submarine canyon yet discovered on Earth. Kroenke Canyon appears to originate in the vicinity of Ontong Java (Solomon Islands) and Nukumanu (Papua New Guinea) atolls, and presumably began to develop when the atolls were high-standing volcanic islands surmounting the ~120 Ma igneous basement of the OJP. The Canyon is characterised by numerous tributaries and significant mass wasting. Kroenke Canyon incises the layer-cake stratigraphy of OJP sediment and sedimentary rock, mostly carbonate with some interbedded chert, which has provided numerous slip surfaces for submarine landslides. The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) roughly coincides with the depth of the transition between the OJP and the neighbouring Nauru Basin. As a result, despite the large volume of sediment eroded and transported by canyon-forming processes, only a minor fan is evident in the Nauru Basin because most of the carbonate has dissolved.",

            "abstract": "Chlorite is a common phyllosilicate mineral in crustal fault zones, and it is generally considered to contribute to fault-zone weakening. However, very little is known about its frictional properties, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining suitable material for study. Synthetic gouges (<90 µm grain size) have been prepared from four chlorite-rich separates whose compositions range between 18.3 and 33.6 wt% MgO, 1.3-21.6 wt% FeO (total Fe content), and 25.0-33.0 wt% SiO2 (electron microprobe analysis). Magnesium contents vary directly with Si and inversely with Fe. Frictional strengths were measured in the temperature range 25-300°C and shearing rates between 0.00115 and 1.15 µm/s, with fluid pressure and effective normal stress held constant at 60 and 100 MPa, respectively. The chlorites are velocity strengthening at all tested conditions, promoting stable slip. No obvious trends in strength relative to either temperature or velocity were discernible for a given chlorite. In contrast, the frictional strength at any given set of physical conditions is a function of chlorite composition, the most Fe-rich chlorite being the strongest (coefficient of friction, µ in the range 0.26-0.36) and the most Mg- and Si-rich sample the weakest (µ = 0.16-0.22). This is one of the first reports of a compositional influence on the frictional properties of a mineral. The results confirm that chlorite will contribute to strength reduction in fault gouge, but the Mg-rich chlorites associated with ultramafic rocks will be more effective weakening agents than the relatively high-Fe chlorites more typical of quartzofeldspathic crustal rocks.",

            "abstract": "<span\">Three ingredients for inducing seismicity are (i) fault or faults capable of slipping seismically, (ii) non-hydrostatic stress state, and (iii) pore fluid pressure perturbation. Slip tendency is the ratio of shear to normal stress for any surface experiencing a three-dimensional stress state. Its value depends on the relative magnitudes of the principal stresses and the orientation of the surface of interest; it is a measure of the likelihood that a surface will experience slip. The value of slip tendency that generates slip is variable and depends on rock type and fault zone characteristics. We investigate geologic scenarios coupling slip tendency analysis with established models of well hydraulics to generate pressure histories throughout a rock volume. Because it is sensitive to both stress and fault geometry, slip tendency is an efficient measure of the propensity of a fault to slip, and is a better predictive tool for induced seismicity than pore fluid pressure, or pore fluid pressure change. Our modeling suggests reasons why the most energetic earthquakes that are linked to subsurface fluid injection in the United States are likely the result of reactivated basement faults. Low permeabilities tend to increase the magnitude of the pore pressure perturbation, which in turn increases slip tendency. For much of the USA, “basement” connotes crystalline rock with low intrinsic permeability, and hence fault and fracture zones are often the primary conductive features within a low permeability host. Many such faults are long-lived, may have experienced repeated reactivation and have been modified by chemically active fluids, they are thus likely to have developed characteristics such as foliation and phyllosilicate mineralogies that reduce their frictional strength. The combination of high slip tendency and low friction renders these faults susceptible to relatively small perturbations in pore fluid pressure.",

Precise calibration of these instruments is needed to understand rapidly changing parameters like sea ice freeboard and to measure optical properties of surfaces like snow covered ice sheets using subsurface scattered photons.\nPhotons travelling into snow, ice, or water before scattering back to the altimeter receiving system (subsurface photons) travel farther and longer than photons scattering off the surface only, causing a bias in the measured elevation. We seek to identify subsurface photons in a laboratory setting using a flight-tested laser altimeter (MABEL) and to quantify their effect on surface elevation estimates for laser altimeter systems.

            "abstract": "Soil microorganisms are the main drivers of soil organic matter cycling. Organic matter input by living plants is the major energy and matter source for soil microorganisms, higher organic matter inputs are found in highly diverse plant communities. It is therefore relevant to understand how plant diversity alters the soil microbial community and soil organic matter. In a general sense, microbial biomass and microbial diversity increase with increasing plant diversity, however the mechanisms driving these interactions are not fully explored. Working with soils from a long-term biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment), we investigated how changes in the soil microbial dynamics related to plant diversity were explained by biotic and abiotic factors. Microbial biomass quantification and differentiation of bacterial and fungal groups was done by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis; terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to determine the bacterial diversity. Gram negative (G-) bacteria predominated in high plant diversity; Gram positive (G+) bacteria were more abundant in low plant diversity and saprotrophic fungi were independent from plant diversity. The separation between G- and G+ bacteria in relation to plant diversity was governed by a difference in carbon-input related factors (e.g. root biomass and soil moisture) between plant diversity levels. Moreover, the bacterial diversity increased with plant diversity and the evenness of the PLFA markers decreased. Our results showed that higher plant diversity favors carbon-input related factors and this in turn favors the development of microbial communities specialized in utilizing new carbon inputs (i.e. G- bacteria), which are contributing to the export of new C from plants to soils.",

            "abstract": "The VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB) is designed with 3 gain stages: Low (LGS), Mid (MGS) and High (HGS) to span bright daytime to moonlit night earth scene signal levels. The published at-launch DNB relative spectral response (RSR) is based upon the LGS spectral measurements, since it was well measured in the pre-launch test program and the LGS can be calibrated by the on-board solar diffuser (MGS and HGS saturate on the SD). The LGS RSR however does not fully represent the spectral characteristics of nighttime DNB data from the MGS and HGS. Nighttime data users who apply the detailed DNB spectral characteristics in their analyses should use modulated RSR appropriate to the MGS and HGS observations. The RSR modulation is due to spectral darkening of the 4 mirrors of the S-NPP VIIRS telescope, which were contaminated with tungsten oxides in fabrication. These tungsten oxides are ‘in family’ with transition lenses on eyeglasses that darken when exposed to sunlight but do not recover when VIIRS goes into darkness because VIIRS in space is in a vacuum (transition lenses require atmospheric oxygen to recover). The on-going mirror darkening has caused a time-dependent shift in DNB RSR towards blue wavelengths. This presentation will provide access to the correct RSR to use for S-NPP DNB nighttime data over the mission time on-orbit. The changes in characteristics will be described in engineering terms to facilitate clear user understanding of how to handle RSR for nighttime observations over the mission lifetime.",

            "abstract": "Scaling problems abound in biogeochemistry. At the finest scale, soil microbes experience habitats and environmental changes that affect the chemical transformations of interest. We collect the DNA of these organisms from sites across landscapes and note differences in who is there, and we seek to evaluate why group membership changes in space (biogeography) and why activity rates change over time (physiology). The goal of efforts at finer scales is often to better predict patterns at larger scales.\nWe conducted such a hierarchical examination of methane uptake in the Great Plains grasslands of North America, gathering data from 22 plots at 8 field locations, scattered from South Dakota to New Mexico and Colorado to Kansas. Our work provides insight into methanotroph biogeochemistry at all of these scales. For example, we found that methane uptake rates vary mostly due to the methanotroph activity, and less so due to diffusivity. A combination of field and lab observations reveal that methanotroph communities differ in their sensitivity to soil moisture and to ammonium (an inhibitor of methanotrophy). Examination of methanotroph community composition reveals tantalizing patterns in composition, dominance and richness across sites, that appears to be structured by patterns of precipitation and soil texture. We anticipate that greater synthesis of these hierarchical findings will paint a richer picture of methanotroph life and enable improved prediction of methane uptake at regional scales.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the effect of spatial gradients in biomass burning (BB) aerosol on mesoscale circulations and clouds in the Amazon through high-resolution numerical modeling over areas of 30 km – 60 km. Inhomogeneous horizontal distribution of BB aerosol results in differential surface heat fluxes and radiative heating of the air, which generates circulation patterns that strongly influence cloud formation. The influence on air circulation and cumulus cloud formation depends on the BB aerosol loading, its vertical location, and the width of the plume. Plumes that reside at higher altitudes (~ 1.5 km altitude) produce monotonic responses to aerosol loading whereas the response to plumes close to the surface changes non-monotonically with plume width and aerosol loading. Sensitivity tests highlight the importance of interactive calculations of surface latent and heat fluxes with a coupled land surface model. In the case of the plume residing at higher altitude, failure to use interactive fluxes results in a reversal of the circulation whereas for the plume residing nearer the surface, the interactive surface model weakens the circulation. The influence of the BB aerosol on heating patterns, circulations, and surface fluxes is significant, and of more importance than the BB aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions themselves.",

            "abstract": "Carbon cycling along the high latitude coastal margins of Alaska is poorly understood relative to boreal and arctic ecosystems. The perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) of southeast Alaska has some of the densest carbon stocks (>300 Mg C ha-1) in the world but the fate of these stocks with continued warming will balance on the poorly constrained rates of carbon accumulation and loss. We quantified the rate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production from four different wetland types (rich fen, poor fen, forested wetland and cedar wetland) using controlled laboratory incubations of surface (10 cm) and subsurface (25 cm) soils incubated at 8 ºC and 15 ºC for 37 weeks. This design allowed us to determine the potential vulnerability of wetland soil carbon stocks to climate warming and partition organic matter mineralization into DOC and CO2 fluxes and its controls (e.g., wetland type and temperature). Furthermore, we used fluorescence characterization of DOC and laboratory bioassays to assess how climate warming may impact the quality and bioavailability of DOC delivered to fluvial systems. Soil depth and temperature strongly influenced carbon loss in all four wetland types with the greatest CO2 fluxes observed in the rich fen and greatest DOC fluxes observed in the poor fen. Of the fluxes, CO2 was the most sensitive to incubation temperature but DOC showed more variation with wetland type. Fluxes of DOC and CO2 were positively correlated only during the last few months of the incubation suggesting strong biotic control of DOC production developed as soil organic matter decomposition progressed. Moreover, bioavailable DOC and protein-like fluorescence were greatest in the initial soil extractions but dramatically decreased over the length of the incubations. Our findings suggest that soil organic matter decomposition will increase as the PCTR continues to warm, but this response will also will vary with wetland type.",

            "abstract": "Continental margins exhibit a range of widths and symmetries defined by the strain patterns that arise during extension and rifting. An important pattern in this respect is the early localization of extension into necking zones. The rheology of the lower crust plays a large role in this localization, and can be affected by inherited orogenic structures, fabrics, and mineral assemblages. Here, we further evaluate the role of orogenic fabrics in continental extension using microstructural observations and thermodynamic modeling of geological sections exposed in the Funeral and Black Mountains of the Death Valley region, California, and from the Mauleon Basin, France. The Death Valley region sits within the Basin-and-Range region of broadly distributed Cenozoic extension, over a relatively flat and deep moho. In contrast, in the Mauleon basin, Cretaceous extension accommodated mantle exhumation, and was strongly localized in older Hercynian orogenic crust. In both areas, mid- to lower crustal rocks are characterized by inherited migmatitic fabrics overprinted by zones of localized, extensional fabrics. Mineral assemblages that formed over a P-T cooling path define the fabrics in each field area. The high-temperature fabrics record decompression-melting due to late- to post-orogenic collapse. Yet, the two field areas show contrasting retrograde assemblages, which are hypothesized to have resulted from changes in the local effective bulk composition produced by differences in melt segregation. At subsequent extensional stages, mid- to lower crustal deformation resulted in the transposition of the inherited post-orogenic fabrics, documented with quartz fabric analysis (including EBSD). The two contrasting regions show how the rheology of inherited orogenic lower crust responds to differences in melt-segregation and metamorphic histories, potentially controlling margin structural evolution.",

            "abstract": "The shelf of the Canadian Beaufort Sea is underlain by relict offshore permafrost that formed in the long intervals of terrestrial exposure during glacial periods. At the shelf edge the permafrost thins rapidly and also warms. This area has a very distinct morphology that we attribute to both the formation and degradation of ice bearing permafrost. Positive relief features include circular to oval shaped topographic mounds, up to 10 m high and ~50 m in diameter which occur at a density of ~6 per km2. Intermixed are circular topographic depressions up to 20 m deep. This topography was investigated using an autonomous underwater vehicle that provides 1 m horizontal resolution bathymetry and chirp profiles, a remotely operated vehicle to document seafloor textures, and sediment cores to sample pore waters. A consistent down-core freshening at rates of 14 to 96 mM Cl- per meter was found in these pore waters near the shelf edge. Downward extrapolation of these trends indicates water with ≤335 mM Cl- should occur at 2.3 to 22.4 m sub-seafloor depths within this shelf edge deformation band. Pore water with 335 mM Cl- or less freezes at -1.4°C. As bottom water temperatures in this area are persistently (<-1.4°C) cold and ground ice was observed in some core samples, we interpret the volume changes associated with mound formation are in part due to pore water freezing. Thermal models (Taylor et al., 2014) predict brackish water along the shelf edge may be sourced in relict permafrost melting under the adjacent continental shelf. Buoyant brackish water is hypothesized to migrate along the base of the relict permafrost, to emerge at the shelf edge and then refreeze when it encounters the colder seafloor. Expansion generated by the formation of ice-bearing permafrost generates the positive relief mounds and ridges. The associated negative relief features may be related to permafrost dynamics also. Permafrost dynamics may have geohazard implications that are unique to the Arctic shelf edge.",

            "abstract": "The Mid-Continent Rift (MCR), a failed Proterozoic rift structure in central North America, is a dominant feature of North American gravity maps. The rift underwent a combination of extension, magmatism, and later compression, and it is difficult to predict how these events affected the overall crustal thickness and bulk composition in the vicinity of the rift axis, though the associated gravity high indicates that large-volume mafic magmatism took place. The Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) project instrumented the MCR with Flexible Array broadband seismographs from 2011 through 2013 in Minnesota and Wisconsin, along two lines crossing the rift axis as well as a line following the axis.\nWe examine teleseismic P-coda data from SPREE and nearby Transportable Array instruments using a new technique: transfer-function analysis. In this approach, possible models of crustal structure are used to generate a predicted transfer function relating the radial and vertical components of the P coda at a particular site. The transfer function then allows generation of a misfit (between the true radial component and a synthetic radial component predicted from the vertical trace) without the need to perform receiver-function deconvolution, thus avoiding the deconvolution problems encountered with receiver functions in sedimentary basins. We use the transfer-function approach to perform a grid search over three crustal properties: crustal thickness, crustal P/S velocity ratio, and the thickness of an overlying sedimentary basin.\nResults for our SPREE/TA data set indicate that the crust is significantly thickened along the rift axis, with maximum thicknesses approaching 50 km; the crust is thinner (ca. 40 km) outside of the rift zone. The crustal thickness structure is particularly complex beneath southeastern Minnesota, where very strong Moho topography is present, as well as up to 2 km of sediment; further north, the Moho is smoother and the basin is not present. P/S ratio varies along the rift axis, suggesting a higher mafic component (higher ratio) in southern Minnesota. The complexity we see along the MCR is consistent with the results obtained by Zhang et al. (this conference) using receiver function analysis.",

            "abstract": "Tidal bores are upstream-propagating hydraulic jumps that episodically form the leading edge of flood tides in upstream-narrowing, gently sloping, coastal rivers which experience high tidal ranges (6 m+, typically). They attain 9 m in height and can penetrate more than 100 km inboard of a shoreline. The deposits of tidal bores, if they can be confidently diagnosed in ancient successions, constitute an unequivocal line of evidence in support of deposition within the tidal-fluvial zone of a lowland river. Deposits of modern tidal bores have been documented, and two recent studies have interpreted tidal bore deposits in ancient (Jurassic and Pennsylvanian) sedimentary rocks. The ancient tidal bore deposits recognized thus far comprise laterally discontinuous, erosionally-based beds of massive to faintly stratified sand, locally muddy and rich in detrital plant debris. Paleoflow structures, where preserved, indicate upstream-directed flow. The beds are enclosed by other, more pervasively stratified sandstones that were the product of ebb and flood-oriented currents in the ancient tidal rivers. The interpreted bore deposits are anomalous in the context of these normal current deposits, and indicate erosive scouring of the substrate followed by the en masse deposition of sand from suspension and upstream advection. Multiple horizons of putative tidal bore deposits are recognized in both the Jurassic and Pennsylvanian examples, suggesting that they were not the product of low-frequency, high-magnitude events such as tsunami or debris flows. It is anticipated that more examples of ancient tidal bore deposits will come to light now that diagnostic criteria are available, and that these will contribute to the fuller recognition of tidally-modulated fluvial deposits in the rock record.",

Although numerous SSWs have been observed in the northern hemisphere, this remains the only recorded major SSW in the southern hemisphere. Much debate has focused on this unique event and the causes, even resulting in a special issue of the Journal of Atmospheric Science. In this work we use the adjoint of NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) to investigate sensitivity to initial conditions during the onset of the 2002 SSW. The adjoint model provides a framework for propagating gradients with respect to the model state backwards in time. As such it is used to reveal aspects of the model initial conditions that have the biggest impact on the temperature in the stratosphere during the warming. The adjoint model reveals a large sensitivity over the southern Atlantic ocean and in the troposphere. This reinforces previous studies that attributed the SSW to a blocking ridge in this region. By converting sensitivity to perturbations it is shown that relatively small localized tropospheric perturbations to winds and temperature can be transported to the stratosphere and have a large impact on the SSW.",

The equations, however, present enormous mathematical challenges, while observed records are commonly analyzed with models borrowed from traditional time series analysis. Such models typically involve unrealistic for atmospheric dynamics strong statistical assumptions, and their data generating mechanisms (DGMs) are noticeably different from the actual ones.\nIn contrast, discussed in the talk novel time series models (in the form of low-order nonlinear dynamical systems, extensions of the celebrated Lorenz model) are derived from the governing equations, whose fundamental properties they inherit. Simple enough to generate numerous long records, they are particularly suited for statistical studies of weather and climate, especially in topics such as extremes, where the estimators are exceedingly sensitive to properties of the DGMs.\nThis new approach to atmospheric time series analysis is motivated by recent progress in statistical properties of dynamical systems. It has been proved that the flow of the Lorenz model satisfies the central limit theorem of probability theory (i.e., series of observations on this model may exhibit statistics of sequences of random variables), and the extreme value theory has been extended from random phenomena to chaotic deterministic dynamical systems, the Lorenz model in particular.",

The comparison focused on North America and Europe sectors during selected two storm events: 2006 AGU storm (14-15 Dec. 2006) and 2013 March storm (17-19 Mar. 2013). The ionospheric models used for this study range from empirical to physics-based, and physics-based data assimilation models. We investigated spatial and temporal variations of TEC during the storms. In addition, we considered several parameters to quantify storm impacts on TEC: TEC changes compared to quiet time, rate of TEC change, and maximum increase/decrease during the storms. In this presentation, we focus on preliminary results of the comparison of the models performance in reproducing the storm-time TEC variations using the parameters and skill scores.

            "abstract": "The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) and Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) have measured normal optical depths throughout Saturn’s rings by stellar occultations covering a wide range of viewing geometries. The UVIS photometer has an effective wavelength of 0.15 µm and a relatively wide (6.0 mrad × 6.4 mrad) field-of-view. VIMS, in occultation mode, measures at an effective wavelength of 2.9 µm and over a single pixel of angular dimensions 0.25 mrad × 0.5 mrad. Occultations measured by VIMS at the same viewing geometry as UVIS occultations overstate the optical depth if particles smaller than 1.22λVIMS/2θ ~ 8.36 mm are present because light diffracted out of the VIMS pixel by those particles is not replaced by neighboring particles. By measuring differential optical depths one can probe the parameters of the ring particle size distribution (i.e. Zebker et al. 1985, Icarus, 64, 531-548). The technique is complicated, however, by the geometric dependence of the optical depth imposed by the non-axisymmetric self-gravity wakes, which are ephemeral elongated aggregates, deformed by Keplerian shear. Beginning with the granola bar wake model of Colwell et al. (2006, Geophys. Res. Lett., 33, L07201), we introduce a free parameter τsmall which represents the excess normal optical depth measured by VIMS due to sub-cm particles between the opaque wakes and combine VIMS and UVIS occultations for particle size analysis while simultaneously determining the properties of the wakes. We find that throughout the A Ring the wake properties generally agree with previously published results (Colwell et al. 2006, Hedman et al. 2007, Astron. J., 133, 2624-2629). We find a significant fraction of sub-cm particles in the inner and outer A Ring and in the troughs of density waves near strong Lindblad resonances. While wake properties vary in the halo regions surrounding these resonances, the abundance of sub-cm particles varies little from 124,000-131,000 km. In the region exterior to the Encke gap we find that the size of the smallest particles in the ring decreases toward the outer edge of the ring. We also find a trend of increasing sub-cm particle abundance toward the outer edge of the A Ring, consistent with previous studies and suggestive of greater erosion of ring particles due to numerous density waves in that region.",

            "abstract": "The geologic mosaic of terranes, adjacent multi-phase plate boundary, rapid lateral topographic variations, and heterogeneous distribution of strain throughout Alaska all suggest strong heterogeneity of crustal architecture. We present a model of crustal thickness across the state is primarily constrained where seismic instrumentation has been deployed – dense coverage in the south-central region and sparse coverage in the north, west, and arc regions. P receiver functions (PRF) were calculated using an upgraded version of Funclab, a software module that retrieves data, calculates receiver functions, facilitates quality control, and calculates H-k stacking, depth mapping via binned Common Conversion Point stacking, and other backend products. 1,678 events and 262 stations yielded 102,000 preliminary PRF that were culled to 21,000 total RFs. Iterative time-domain deconvolution was performed about a 1 Hz central frequency for ZRT traces. Our model reproduces many of the Moho depth variations previously modeled by receiver functions and gravity. Thick (>60 km) crust below the Chugach and St. Elias Ranges transitions to ~40 km thick crust south of the Denali Fault. Immediately to the north, thin (29-35) crust is observed in central Alaska between the Alaska and Brooks Ranges. The central Brooks Range is observed to have a thick crustal root below its topographic high axis. Stations scattered throughout western Alaska and the Bering Sea regions generally show average (~35 km) thickness crust while displaying inter-station uniqueness in the form of stacked RFs. Below the forearc and central Alaska Range, the Yakutat slab Moho is also observed. To complete coverage for the state we use a gravity Moho model calibrated to our receiver function solutions. The resolution of gravity-derived Moho models is limited and can only produce a smoothed approximation of the actual Moho. Where receiver function results are dense we observe significant complexity to the Moho, consistent with active tectonic processes. We also explore lateral variations in Moho trends and compare with previously determined Sp receiver functions that provide estimates of lithospheric thickness. Our goal is to produce a model to serve as reference for up-coming Earthscope seismic results.",

            "abstract": "Energy-to-moment ratios can provide information on the distribution of seismic source spectrum between high and low frequencies, and thus identify anomalous events (either \"slow\" or \"snappy\") whose source violates seismic scaling laws, the former characteristic of the so-called tsunami earthquakes (e.g., Mentawai, 2010), the latter featuring enhanced acceleration and destruction (e.g., Christchurch, 2011). We extend to deep earthquakes the concept of the slowness paramete, Θ=log10EE/M0, introduced by Newman and Okal [1998], where the estimated energy EE is computed for an average focal mechanism and depth (in the range 300-690 km). We find that only minor modifications of the algorithm are necessary to adapt it to deep earthquakes. The analysis of a dataset of 160 deep earthquakes from the past 30 years show that these events scale with an average Θ=-4.34±0.31, corresponding to slightly greater strain release than for their shallow counterparts. However, the most important result to date is that we have not found any \"outliers\", i.e., violating this trend by one or more logarithmic units, as was the case for the slow events at shallow depths. This indicates that the processes responsible for such variations in energy distribution in the source spectrum of shallow earthquakes, are absent from their deep counterparts, suggesting, perhaps not unexpectedly, that the deep seismogenic zones feature more homogeneous properties than shallow ones. This includes the large event of 30 May 2015 below the Bonin Islands (Θ=-4.13), which took place both deeper than, and oceanwards of, the otherwise documented Wadati-Benioff Zone.",

            "abstract": "Mercury's magnetosphere is much more dynamic than other planetary magnetospheres because of Mercury's weak intrinsic magnetic field and its proximity to the Sun. Magnetic reconnection and Kelvin-Helmholtz phenomena occur in Mercury's magnetopause and magnetotail at higher frequencies than in other planetary magnetosphere. For instance, chains of flux transfer events (FTEs) on the magnetopause, have been frequentlyobserved by the the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft (Slavin et al., 2012). Because ion Larmor radius is comparable to typical spatial scales in Mercury's magnetosphere, finite Larmor radius effects need to be accounted for. In addition, it is important to take in account non-ideal dissipation mechanisms to accurately describe magnetic reconnection. A kinetic approach allows us to model these phenomena accurately. However, kinetic global simulations, even for small-size magnetospheres like Mercury’s, are currently unfeasible because of the high computational cost. In this work, we carry out global simulations of Mercury's magnetosphere with the recently developed MHD-EPIC model, which is a two-way coupling of the extended magnetohydrodynamic (XMHD) code BATS-R-US with the implicit Particle-in-Cell (PIC) model iPIC3D. The PIC model can cover the regions where kinetic effects are most important, such as reconnection sites. The BATS-R-US code, on the other hand, can efficiently handle the rest of the computational domain where the MHD or Hall MHD description is sufficient. We will present our preliminary results and comparison with MESSENGER observations.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols influence climate by directly reflecting or absorbing sunlight, or indirectly by affecting clouds. A major source of aerosols is from oceanic wave breaking. Due to their complexity, the effects of marine aerosol on climate are uncertain. To provide more detailed measurements of the chemical composition of marine aerosols, Scanning Transmission X-Ray Microscopy coupled with Near Edge X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (SXTM-NEXAFS) was used to give spatially resolved molecular information for carbon and oxygen. Application of STXM/NEXAFS to particles collected during a mesocosm study using a unique wave channel facility to generate aerosols shows that the organic volume fraction of aerosols at the aerodynamic diameter size range of 0.18-0.32 µm are a direct function of the biological activity in the sea water. Aerosol organic volume fraction increased from 0.32 for particles generated from seawater containing low biolife to 0.49 and 0.40 for particles produced during phytoplankton blooms. However, the organic volume fraction of aerosols at the aerodynamic diameter size range of 0.56-1 µm did not change with biological activity. Measurements also show that different types of organics can concentrate into aerosols depending on the enzyme activity expressed at the time. Enhanced spectral signatures for aliphatic hydrocarbons were observed during the first phytoplankton bloom compared to a second phytoplankton bloom occurring directly thereafter. The decreased signature of aliphatic organics in the second phytoplankton bloom was correlated with increased lipase activity from heterobacteria.  Organic aggregates having similar morphology also differ in composition from their carbon spectra from the two blooms. For July 17, organic aggregates were much richer in hydrocarbons, which showed a remarkably intense C-H absorbance and a broad C-C absorbance. Organic aggregates observed for July 26-27, did not have the C-H and C-C signatures, but contained more polar functional groups including C=O, suggesting the organics for this time period were more soluble. These results suggest that oceanic biological activity can affect the composition and morphology of marine aerosols and consequently, change the effectiveness with which marine aerosols form clouds.",

            "abstract": "The DEEPWAVE field project took place over the New Zealand region during June and July of 2014 and was focused on observing orographic and non-orographic gravity waves from their source regions in the troposphere to attenuation regions in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. An important preliminary finding of this project is that many mountain wave events are attenuated in a 15-20km “valve layer” in the lower stratosphere, characterized by weak winds and non-linearity. This valve layer strongly attenuates about half of New Zealand mountain wave events, reducing wave momentum fluxes by as much as 90% and producing a maximum in momentum flux divergence. This work further characterizes this lower-stratospheric mountain wave attenuation and seeks to understand the physics of actual wave attenuation events “reproduced” within 6- and 2-km resolution realistic WRF simulations. Local attenuation diagnostics, such as Richardson Number, stratification, and the non-linearity ratio, are used to characterize the size and 3-D distribution of attenuation regions and to diagnose dissipation mechanisms. Potential vorticity (PV) is also used as a diagnostic to identify attenuation regions and also to trace the influences of these regions downstream. Preliminary work has revealed that mountain wave attenuation over New Zealand is spatially inhomogeneous, generates PV in dipoles, and that lateral shear instabilities cause lateral mixing 1000s of kilometers downstream of the attenuation regions.",

While the RIS4E team consists of four themes, each dedicated to a different aspect of airless body exploration, this submission details the RIS4E work underway to maximize an astronaut’s effectiveness while conducting surface science. The next generation of surface science operations will look quite different than the EVAs (extravehicular activities) conducted during Apollo. Astronauts will possess data of much higher resolution than the Apollo reconnaissance data, and the EVAs will thus be designed to answer targeted science questions. Additionally, technological advancements over the last several decades have made it possible to conduct in situ analyses of a caliber much greater than was achievable during Apollo. For example, lab techniques such as x-ray fluorescence, x-ray diffraction, and multi-spectral imaging are now available in field portable formats, meaning that astronauts can gain real-time geochemical awareness during sample collection. The integration of these instruments into EVA operations, however, has not been widely tested. While these instruments will provide the astronaut with a high-resolution look at regional geochemistry and structure, their implementation could prove costly to the already constrained astronaut EVA timeline. The RIS4E team, through fieldwork at the December 1974 lava flow at Kilauea Volcano, HI, investigates the incorporation of portable technologies into planetary surface exploration and explores the relationship between science value added from these instruments and the cost associated with integrating them into an EVA timeline. We also consider what an appropriate instrumentation suite would be for the exploration of a volcanic terrain using this ideal terrestrial analog (see Rogers et al., Young et al., Bleacher et al., and Yant et al., this meeting).",

Issues that range from environmental degradation and natural hazards to creating sustainable economic systems or livable cities. Human health and resilience also involves the Earth. Environmental hazard issues have dimensions and consequences that have connections to environmental justice and disproportionate impacts on people based on their ethnicity, gender, cultural and socioeconomic conditions. Often these dimensions are hidden or unexplored in common approaches to teaching about hazards. However, they can provide importance context and meaning to students who would not otherwise see themselves in STEM disciplines. Teaching geoscience in a framework of societal issues may be an important mechanism for building science and sustainability capacity in future graduates.\nIn May 2015, the NSF STEP center InTeGrate held a workshop in New Orleans, LA on teaching about Coastal Hazards, Risk and Environmental Justice. This was an opportunity to bring together people who use these topics as a powerful topic for transdisciplinary learning that connects science to local communities. This workshop was tailored for faculty members from minority-serving institutions and other colleges and universities that serve populations that are under-represented in the geosciences and related fields. The workshop outcome was a set of strategies for accomplishing this work, including participants’ experience teaching with local cases, making connections to communities, and building partnerships with employers to understand workforce needs related to interdisciplinary thinking, sustainability science and risk. The participants articulated both the great need and opportunity for educators to help learners to explore these dimensions with their students as well as the challenge of learning to teach across disciplines and using controversial topics.",

Although the NEI has the maximum area-weighted rainfall, its contribution is the least toward a strong or weak monsoon.

The method is minimal invasive and therefore provides a unique opportunity to image subsurface variability not possible with standard point-scale equipment, such as TDR- and/or capacitance probes.\nFull-waveform inversion (FWI) of cross-borehole GPR uses the entire waveform of the transmitted electromagnetic signal. The recorded data contains information on the travel time of the pulse, as well as the attenuation, resulting in moisture content and electrical conductivity images of the subsurface using just one method. Few case studies of cross-borehole GPR FWI using real data have been published to date. The majority of these studies focus on estimating the variation in porosity in the saturated zone (e.g. in gravel aquifers, fractured metamorphic rock, and heterogeneous chalk sediments).\nIn this study, we use cross-borehole GPR to monitor the infiltration of a saline tracer into an unsaturated sandy soil. In September 2011, saline water was added across a 142 m2 area at an agricultural field site in Denmark. A total of 3.3 mm saline water was applied mimicking a natural infiltration event. During the following year, the tracer infiltration into the subsurface was monitored using cross-borehole GPR at weekly to monthly intervals. Furthermore, five cores were extracted within the field site to obtain independent profiles of soil moisture and pore water conductivity for comparison.\nThe cross-borehole GPR data were inverted using ray-based and FWI techniques. For the FWI an appropriate starting model and an effective wavelet must be estimated. Preliminary results indicate that the data modeled for the FWI results mimic better the measured data compared to the ray-based results. However, more research is needed to investigate the influence of the used starting model and the effective wavelet estimation.",

            "abstract": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems are highly productive marine regions. Primary production in these systems is performed by a complex array of phytoplankton, many of which are in the picophytoplankton size class (≤2 µM diameter). Because morphological features in these small cells are limited and difficult to visualize, our understanding of their distributions and activities is poor. Even at broad levels, such as cyanobacteria versus picoeukaryotes, contributions to primary production are not well resolved. However, laboratory experiments show that the biology of species within each of these groups is highly differentiated. Hence, to develop predictive understanding of primary production in these regions, its transfer to higher trophic levels and key export terms, it is necessary to understand which taxa are present and their in situ activities. Here, we report results from multi-year expeditions along a transect (Line 67) that extends from Monterey Bay, California (USA) to the North Pacific Gyre and is also part of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). We explore the diversity of phytoplankton in the coastal zone, the upwelling-transition zone and subtropical gyre-like waters to gain insights into controls acting on primary producers in each. Our Line 67 results on primary producer dynamics are underlain by a comprehensive suite of genomic, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and molecular analyses. Statistical approaches have helped us to define temperature maxima, nutrient thresholds and important remineralization processes that influence dominance by specific eukaryotic algae. First-ever species-specific growth and grazing mortality rates provide an unprecedented view of contributions to biomass production and its consumption by higher trophic levels. Finally, by investigating the entire microbial community including heterotrophic taxa, we are able to establish baselines for community interactions that are affiliated with productivity in this Eastern Boundary System. Collaborative efforts with the modeling and remote sensing communities should extend the results and methodologies developed here to improve understanding of primary producer communities in present and future climates scenarios and estimates from satellite measurements.",

            "abstract": "Any core formation models would lead to the incorporation of sulfur (S) into the Earth's core, based on the cosmochemical/geochemical constraints, sulfur's chemical affinity for iron (Fe), and low eutectic melting temperature in the Fe-FeS system. Preferential partitioning of S into the melt also provides petrologic constraint on the density difference between the liquid outer and solid inner cores. Therefore, the center issue is to constrain the amount of sulfur in the core. Geochemical constraints usually place 2-4 wt.% S in the core after accounting for its volatility, whereas more S is allowed in models based on mineral physics data. Here we re-examine the constraints on the S content in the core by both petrologic and mineral physics data. We have measured S partitioning between solid and liquid iron in the multi-anvil apparatus and the laser-heated diamond anvil cell, evaluating the effect of pressure on melting temperature and partition coefficient. In addition, we have conducted shockwave experiments on Fe-11.8wt%S using a two-stage light gas gun up to 211 GPa. The new shockwave experiments yield Hugoniot densities and the longitudinal sound velocities. The measurements provide the longitudinal sound velocity before melting and the bulk sound velocity of liquid. The measured sound velocities clearly show melting of the Fe-FeS mix with 11.8wt%S at a pressure between 111 and 129 GPa. The sound velocities at pressures above 129GPa represent the bulk sound velocities of Fe-11.8wt%S liquid. The combined data set including density, sound velocity, melting temperature, and S partitioning places a tight constraint on the required sulfur partition coefficient to produce the density and velocity jumps and the bulk sulfur content in the core.",

            "abstract": "Elevated levels of nutrient loadings have enriched the Chesapeake Bay estuaries and coastal waters via point and nonpoint sources and the atmosphere. Restoring oyster beds is considered a Best Management Practice (BMP) to improve the water quality as well as provide physical aquatic habitat and a healthier estuarine system. Efforts include declaring sanctuaries for brood-stocks, supplementing hard substrate on the bottom and aiding natural populations with the addition of hatchery-reared and disease-resistant stocks. An economic assessment suggests that restoring the ecological functions will improve water quality, stabilize shorelines, and establish a habitat for breeding grounds that outweighs the value of harvestable oyster production. Parametric factorial models were developed to investigate multicolinearities among in situ water quality and oyster restoration activities to evaluate posterior success rates upon multiple substrates, and physical, chemical, hydrological and biological site characteristics to systematically identify significant factors. Findings were then further utilized to identify the optimal sites for successful oyster restoration augmentable with Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) and BMPs. Factorial models evaluate the relationship among the dependent variable, oyster biomass, and treatments of temperature, salinity, total suspended solids, E. coli/Enterococci counts, depth, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, nitrogen and phosphorus, and blocks consist of alternative substrates (oyster shells versus riprap, granite, cement, cinder blocks, limestone marl or combinations). Factorial model results were then compared to identify which combination of variables produces the highest posterior biomass of oysters. Developed Factorial model can facilitate maximizing the likelihood of successful oyster reef restoration in an effort to establish a healthier ecosystem and to improve overall estuarine water quality in the Chesapeake Bay estuaries.",

Results of a study of Alfvén modes propagating outward from the Sun in streaming inhomogeneous plasma for the inner heliosphere (≤ 1AU) region show that a simultaneous action of macro scale and resonant wave-particle instabilities of shell-like distribution combined with nonlinear wave-wave interaction of shear and kinetic Alfvén branches may be responsible for formation of both parallel and perpendicular spectra of the solar wind turbulence. The study does not use any of the available nonlinear models of imbalanced incompressible MHD turbulence but nevertheless correctly reproduces several peculiarities of the solar wind turbulence spectra that currently generate significant difficulties for the solar wind MHD turbulence models. Our approach correctly explains the fine structure of parallel fluctuations, quantitatively describes the prevalence of a turbulent energy in perpendicular (k⊥ ) scales over energy contained in propagating parallel (k|| ) to the local magnetic field perturbations. The radial dependence of the turbulent spectral break is also predicted rather well.",

            "abstract": "Asphalt volcanism in the deep ocean can generate substantial areas of hard substratum and hydrocarbon fluxes that support chemosynthetic communities. The process was first described in the southern Gulf of Mexico following the discovery in 2003 of Chapopote, a knoll at 3200m depth that includes large asphalt flows. F/S METEOR returned to the region in February and March, 2015 to quantify the extent and characteristics of Chapopote and other asphalt-hosting knolls using the SEAL AUV, QUEST ROV, shipborne acoustics, and autonomous instrument landers. Preliminary findings have greatly expanded the number of confirmed asphalt volcanoes, as well as sites where seepage was detected as gas flares in the water column. The morphology of asphalt flows, which was investigated using large-scale photo-mosaicking techniques, indicated that they form with a complex interplay of gravity flows, buoyant uplift, and chemical weathering. Geochemical analysis of asphalt samples is underway to investigate the ages of material and the time-constants of alterations after exposure at the seafloor. Rapid gas hydrate formation had generated massive seafloor deposits at several sites. Notably, gas hydrate mounds had been colonized by aggregations of 2m long tubeworms that extended over areas approaching 1000 sq m in some cases. The biological community comprised an abundant assemblage in which the caridean shrimp Alvinocaris muricola and the squat lobsters Munidopsis geyeri and M. exuta were numerically dominant. Chemosynthetic fauna were primarily the tubeworm Escarpia laminate, observed on asphalt surfaces and gas hydrate substrate and the mussel Bathymodiolus heckarae, observed around active gas vents. Prospects for oil and gas development in the region raise questions regarding appropriate measures for safeguarding lush chemosynthetic communities.",

In this study, an Ambient Pressure Mass Spectrometer (AmPMS) that is selective and sensitive to molecules with a high proton affinity, such as amines, was coupled with a newly built corona discharge ion source. AmPMS was used to monitor many different nitrogenous compound that are found in an urban atmosphere (July 2015, Minneapolis), down to the single digit pmol/mol level. Simultaneous to this, a proton transfer mass spectrometer also sampled the atmosphere through an inlet within 20 m of the AmPMS inlet. In another set of studies, a similar AmPMS was attached to a large Teflon film chamber at the Atmospheric Chemistry Division at NCAR (August 2015, Boulder). Exploratory studies are planned on the sticking of amines to the chamber walls as well as oxidizing the amine and monitoring products. Depending on the success of these studies, results will be presented on the reversability of amine partitioning and mass balance for these species in the chamber.",

In the reactor, nitrous acid, water and sulfur dioxide gases along with ultraviolet light produced sulfuric acid. The particles formed from these vapors were detected with a scanning mobility particle spectrometer equipped with a diethylene glycol condensation particle counter (Jiang et al. 2011). For a set of standard conditions, particles attained a log-normal distribution with a peak diameter of 6 nm, and a total number of about 3x105 cm-3. The distributions show that ~70 % of the particles are between 4 and 8 nm diameter (lnσ ~ 0.37). These standard conditions are: 296 K, 25% relative humidity, total flow = 3 sLpm, ~10 ppbv HONO, SO2 in excess. With variations of relative humidity, the total particle number varied strongly, with a power relationship of ~3.5, and the size distributions showed a slight increase in peak diameter with relative humidity, increasing about 1 nm from 8 to 33 % relative humidity. Variations of HONO at a constant light intensity (wavelength of ~ 360 nm) were performed and particle size and total number changed dramatically. Size distributions also changed drastically with variations of light intensity, accomplished by turning on/off some of the black light flourescent bulbs that illuminated the flow reactor. Comparisons of these size distributions to recently published nucleation experiments (e.g. Zollner et al., Glasoe et al.) as well as to simulations of PhoFR reveal important details about the levels of sulfuric acid present in PhoFR as well as possible base contaminants.",

            "abstract": "As the solar wind plasma flows away from the Sun, it eventually collides with the local interstellar medium, creating the heliosphere. Neutral atoms from interstellar space travel inside the heliosphere and charge-exchange with the solar wind plasma, creating energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). Some of these ENAs travel outside the heliosphere, undergo two charge-exchange events, and travel back inside the heliosphere towards Earth, with the strongest intensity in directions perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field (IMF). It is widely believed that this process generates the “ribbon” of enhanced ENA intensity observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), and has been shown to explain many key features of the observations.\nIBEX observations of the ribbon are composed of a complex, line-of-sight integration of ENAs that come from different distances beyond the heliopause, and thus the ENAs detected by IBEX over a wide range of energies are uniquely coupled to the IMF draped around the heliosphere. We present a detailed analysis of the IBEX ribbon measurements using 3D simulations of the heliosphere and computations of the ribbon flux at Earth based on IBEX capabilities, and derive the magnitude and direction of the IMF required to reproduce the position of the IBEX ribbon in the sky.

What is unknown is how far these TIDs traveled after being launched by the tsunami and the role of the underlying neutral atmosphere on their propagation characteristics. For the first time, we show that TIDs associated with the Tohoku tsunami were observed in GPS TEC data for several hours over the west coast of the US and as far inland as Colorado. The results presented here show a range of TIDs generated by gravity wave packets propagating into the ionosphere from below. We present results indicating the presence of TIDs with periods ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, and horizontal wavelengths from 150 km to 400 km. The azimuth of the observed TID wave train was 121.8 ± 1.8° (angle measured in degrees east of north), which matches the azimuth of the tsunami near the Pacific coast of the US. The observed period of the TIDs was one of the spectral components of the tsunami wave packet as it approached the Pacific coast of the US. These results suggest that the tsunami was the source of the TIDs over the US. Additionally, the TID periods and horizontal wavelengths clearly vary in longitude. These variations agree with theoretical gravity wave results concerning propagation and dissipation in the thermosphere.",

The aerosols are assimilated by using the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model, which interact directly with the radiation parameterization, and radiatively coupled with atmospheric model dynamics in the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5). The data have been grouped into five datasets, including variables such as: dust column mass density, dust column mass density – PM 2.5, dust deposition, SO2 column mass density, aerosol optical depth analysis, total aerosol extinction AOT 550nm, black carbon emission etc. The data are available at hourly or 3-hourly and monthly at horizontal spatial resolution of 0.5x0.625 degrees (latitude x longitude) and 72 eta coordinate levels extending to 0.01 hPa for 3-dimensional variables. This presentation will document data access services at GES DISC and how to explore the data through the online visualization tool (Giovanni). As use cases, aerosol transportation of selected events will be demonstrated: a) SO2 column mass density from volcano Sierra Negra (Oct 2005), stayed in the tropical atmosphere for about 20 days; b) dust column mass density from a Asian dust storm in April 2001, transported dust from Asia across Pacific to North America in about one week; and c) black carbon column mass density from a wildfire late July to early September 2010 in Russia.",

            "abstract": "The snow ablation period is a time of great potential for carbon uptake in high-elevation, subalpine forests. During this period, water availability associated with snowmelt promotes photosynthetic carbon uptake, while snow cover diminishes carbon losses from soil respiration. Although the ablation period can be as short as two weeks, as much as 30% of the total seasonal carbon uptake can occur during this period. Varying ablation period dynamics, however, can result in varying rates of carbon uptake during this integral uptake period. We use fifteen years of observational climate flux and snow water equivalent (SWE) data for a subalpine forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to analyze carbon uptake trends during the annual ablation period. Specifically, we focus on how the timing of peak SWE affects carbon uptake during the ablation period. We find that when the snowmelt period occurs one month earlier than average, the forest experiences an ablation period mean air temperature of 2.7° C, approximately 5° C colder than an ablation period that occurs one month later than average. This early, colder atmospheric condition leads to daytime carbon uptake rates that are 2.5 gC/m2/day less than the later, warmer period, which results in 47 gC/m2 less ablation period carbon uptake. As most climate models project peak SWE to occur earlier under various warming scenarios, we can expect to see a trend of less carbon uptake during future ablation periods. We expect to see a decrease in total growing season carbon uptake if the post-snowmelt period is unable to compensate for the decrease in ablation period carbon uptake.",

In this study we make a comparison between ground-based optical measurements of the premidnight growth phase/onset arcs at subauroral latitudes and magnetically conjugate measurements made by the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) at ~780 km in altitude and by the Van Allen Probe-B spacecraft crossing L values of ~5.0–5.6 in the premidnight inner tail region. The conjugate observations offer a unique opportunity to examine the detailed features of the arc location relative to large-scale Birkeland currents and of the magnetospheric counterpart.

            "abstract": "It is poorly known whether the shallow parts of subduction megathrust faults commonly weaken in great earthquakes to cause coseismic slip to trench, or strengthen to resist coseismic slip but slip to trench afterwards. The 2011 M 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake offers an example of coseismic slip to trench. Comparison of high-resolution bathymetry data collected over the Japan Trench before and after the earthquake shows an overall seafloor uplift of ~ 10-20 m landward of the trench. By modeling the bathymetry change, we determine a coseismic fault slip up to ~ 60 m at the trench. In comparison, GPS displacements recorded on the near-trench (~ 60 km) islands after the 2005 M 8.7 Nias, Sumatra, earthquake suggest large shallow afterslip, although coseismic slip at the trench cannot be resolved. The 2012 M 7.6 Nicoya, Costa Rica, earthquake provides an unambiguous example for slip to trench only after the earthquake. The difference in seafloor pressures observed at sites < 1 km apart on the seaward and landward sides of the thrust outcrop did not show any change during the earthquake, indicating no coseismic slip to trench; only afterwards did pressure differences indicate gradual uplift of the prism toe relative to the incoming plate, suggesting afterslip reaching the trench. Finally, at Nankai, occurrences of very-low-frequency earthquakes at shallow depths (< 10 km below seafloor) and concurrent borehole pressure transients near the trench suggest that episodic slip to trench occurs well into the interseismic interval there. These observations showing distinctly different shallow fault behaviour raise several questions: What factors control the behaviour of the shallow fault? Is the shallow fault behaviour margin-dependent? Can the same shallow fault behave differently in different earthquakes? We speculate that earthquake size and the amount of slip play dominant roles. The shallow megathrust tends to exhibit rate-strengthening at low slip rates and resists seismic rupture such as in the Costa Rica earthquake, but a sufficiently large slip of the deeper rupture zone may force the shallow part to slip and may even cause dynamic weakening at high slip rates such as in the Tohoku-oki earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing temperature changes in the Arctic are large relative to lower latitudes; a process known as Arctic Amplification. Arctic temperatures have increased at least 3 times the rate of mid-latitude temperatures relative to the late 20th century, due to multiple interacting feedbacks driven by modest global change. Even if global temperature increases are contained to +2° C by 2040, Arctic (North of 60° N) monthly mean temperatures in fall will increase by +5° C. The Arctic is very likely to be sea ice free during summer before 2040, with the sea ice free duration limited to <5 months. Snow cover will be absent in May and June on most land masses. Whether these changes impact mid-latitude weather events is complex and controversial, as the time period for observing such linkages is short [<10 years] and involves understanding direct forcing by Arctic changes on a chaotic climatic system. Although chaotic internal variability dominates the dynamics of atmospheric circulation, Arctic thermodynamic influences can reinforce regional weather patterns. Extreme Arctic temperature events, as a combination of mean temperature increases combined with natural variability, will become common, nearing and exceeding previous thresholds. Such an event as an analog for the future was the +4° C anomalies for Alaska in November-December 2014 related to recent warm Pacific sea surface temperatures. Thus for the next few decades out to 2040, continuing rapid environmental changes in the Arctic are very likely, despite any mitigation activities, and the appropriate response is to plan for adaptation to meet these mean and extreme event changes. Mitigation is essential to forestall further disasters in the second half of the century. It is important to note such future rapid Arctic amplification, and the potential for environmental surprises, to support those making planning decisions and encourage action.",

            "abstract": "Although the Midcontinent Rift (MCR) had been thought to have formed by isolated midplate volcanism and failed due to Grenville compression, a more plausible scenario is that it formed as part of the rifting of Amazonia from Laurentia and became inactive once seafloor spreading was established. Structural modeling of seismic reflection data shows an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a fault-controlled extending basin, and a postrift phase where volcanics and sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding basin without associated faulting. The MCR thus has the geometry of a rift but a LIP's magma volume. A crucial constraint on the evolution of the MCR comes from the roughly flat-lying Jacobsville sandstone, Bayfield group, and other equivalent sediments (JBE) that overlie the dipping volcanics and sediments deposited in the MCR basin. The MCR’s “failure” - the ending of volcanism and extension and thus its failure to develop into a new ocean basin - has been attributed to compression during the Grenville orogeny, the series of collisions that assembled Amazonia and other continents into the supercontinent of Rodinia from ~1.3 Ga - ~0.95 Ga. The JBE’s age is poorly constrained, with proposed ages ranging from ~1100 – ~542 Ma. Many analyses assume that the JBE are either post-rift sediments deposited in the thermal subsidence stage or syntectonic strata associated with the inversion of the rift. In this view, deformation of the JBE by reverse faults including the Keweenaw and Douglas faults occurred at ~1.060 Ga, reflecting Grenville compression ending the MCR’s evolution. However, paleomagnetic, structural, compositional, and detrital zircon data suggest that these units are much younger than previously thought, so much of the deformation thought to have occurred at ~1.06 Ga is likely much younger. Recent new zircon data for the Jacobsville collected in summer 2015 should help resolve this question.",

            "abstract": "The Argentinian Andes define key examples of retroarc shortening and basin evolution above a zone of active subduction. The La Ramada fold-thrust belt (RFTB) in the High Andes provides insights into the relative influence and temporal records of diverse convergent margin processes (e.g. flat-slab subduction, convergent wedge dynamics, structural inversion). The RFTB contains Mesozoic extensional basin strata deformed by later Andean shortening. New detrital zircon U-Pb analyses of Mesozoic rift sediments reveal: (1) a dominant Permo-Triassic age signature (220-280 Ma) associated with proximal sources of effective basement (Choiyoi Group) during Triassic synrift deposition; (2) upsection younging of maximum depositional ages from Late Triassic through Early Cretaceous (230 to 100 Ma) with the increasing influence of western Andean arc sources; and (3) a significant Late Cretaceous influx of Paleozoic (~350-550 Ma) and Proterozoic (~650-1300 Ma) populations during the earliest shift from back-arc post-extensional subsidence to upper-plate shortening. The Cenozoic detrital record of the Manantiales foreland basin (between the Frontal Cordillera and Precordillera) records RFTB deformation prior to flat-slab subduction. A Permo-Triassic Choiyoi age signature dominates the Miocene succession, consistent with sources in the proximal Espinacito range. Subordinate Mesozoic (~80-250 Ma) to Proterozoic (~850-1800 Ma) U-Pb populations record exhumation of the Andean magmatic arc and recycling of different structural levels in the RFTB during thrusting/inversion of Mesozoic rift basin strata and subjacent Paleozoic units. Whereas maximum depositional ages of sampled Manantiales units cluster at 18-20 Ma, the Estancia Uspallata basin (~50 km to the south) shows consistent upsection younging of Cenozoic populations attributed to proximal volcanic centers. Ongoing work will apply low-temperature thermochronology to pinpoint basin accumulation histories and thrust timing.",

However, these trends are less understood in regions of complex terrain or in coastal regions where temperature gradients are relatively larger and mesoscale features are important. Thus it is important to understand the regional impacts of terrain and land/water contrasts on heat extremes in a warming world, and identify changes in the conditions that drive such extremes. The northwest U.S. is a region with such surface complexity, where regional heat extremes arise from synoptic/mesoscale interactions between the large-scale flow and local topography\nThis talk will analyze changes to the synoptic and mesoscale conditions associated with heat extremes over the northwest U.S. by utilizing CMIP5 global climate model simulations, and dynamically downscaled regional climate models. An analysis of changes in mid- to low-level tropospheric temperature, offshore/onshore flow, soil moisture, precipitation, and cloud fraction are described, as well as how these changes interact with regional terrain and land/water contrasts to alter the temperature distributions over the region.\nCMIP5 models suggest that low-level zonal wind distributions over the northwest U.S. become narrower, leading to fewer days with strong offshore flow. Soil moisture is projected to decline over the region due to reductions in clouds and precipitation, as well as general warming. Historical and future regional temperature distributions will be described, and it will be shown that even though climate models predict increases in heat extremes for western Oregon and Washington, these increases are far fewer compared to inland areas. The variance over most inland locations increases, with the exception of the northwest U.S., where variance doesn’t change. The importance of regional terrain and land/water contrasts in explaining these changes will be described.",

The goal is to create a tool that will sort the data provided by the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (LISN) in South America. The tool will look for patterns in TEC and try to correlate patterns with solar activity or terrestrial weather. We present the qualitatively categorized TEC patterns from December 2011 and the quantitative tool being created to sort through the larger set of several years of TEC data.

Within the RCSP, the Montana State University-Bozeman led Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Project has focused on potential CO2 storage sites, including the Kevin Dome in northern Montana. The 750mi2 large dome lies along the north-southwest trending Sweetgrass Arch and is a natural CO2 reservoir with the potential to produce one million tonnes of CO2. The Project intends to extract and reinject this one million tonnes of CO2back into the water-leg of the Dome within the dolomitic, middle Duperow Formation to monitor impacts on the surrounding environment and communities. The caprock system includes extremely low porosity dolomite in the upper Duperow that is overlain by the anhydrite-dominated Potlatch caprock. Core was extracted by the Project from the Wallawein 22-1 well. Six 1\"-diameter sub-samples were taken at depths of 3687 and 3689' of the 4\"-diameter core in both vertical and horizontal directions.\nUnconfined uniaxial compression tests were conducted at room temperature using an Instron 4483 load frame with a 150kN load cell operated at a strain rate of 6.835-5mm per second. Samples were instrumented with four strain gages to record elastic moduli and characterize fracture behavior. The Potlatch anhydrite has demonstrated to be both strong and stiff with an average uniaxial compressive strength of 150.62±23.95MPa, a Young’s modulus of 89.96±10.22GPa, and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.32±0.05. These three variables are essential to developing geomechanical models that assess caprock responses to injection during CO2 sequestration. Petrographic characterizations of the fractured samples reveal an 80% groundmass of subeuhedral anhydrite crystals measuring 97-625µm and 20% 0.12-1mm wide veins comprised of 9-35µm wide dolomite grains that become increasingly anhedral toward vein centers. Petrographic observations of tightly aligned anhydrite grains support the porosity of 7.5% calculated from sample densities. Such microscopic observations are key to understanding fracture propogation and permeability responses on a reservoir scale.",

The program was focussed on providing a supportive environment for 2nd and 3rd year undergraduates, many of whom were first generation and underrepresented students. This model provides three levels of mentorship support for the participating interns: 1) the primary research advisor provides academic and professional support. 2) The program coordinator, who meets with the interns multiple times per week, provides personal support and helps the interns to assimilate into the highly competitive environment of the research laboratory. 3) Returning undergraduate interns provided peer support and guidance to the new cohort of students. The impacts of this program on the first generation students and the research mentors, as well as the lessons learned will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide snow clouds are known to occur in the polar regions on Mars during the long polar night. Earlier studies have shown that a substantial fraction (up to ~20%) of the seasonal ice caps of Mars can be deposited as CO2 snowfall. The presence of optically thick clouds can also strongly influence the polar energy balance, by scattering thermal radiation emitted by the surface and lower atmosphere. Furthermore, snow deposition is likely to affect the surface morphology and subsequent evolution of the seasonal caps. Therefore, both the spatial distribution and time variability of polar snow clouds are important for understanding their influence on the Martian CO2cycle and climate. However, previous investigations have suffered from relatively coarse time resolution (typically days), coarse or incomplete spatial coverage, or both.\nHere we report results of a dedicated campaign by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, to observe polar CO2 clouds with an unprecedented time-resolution within the same spatial region. By scanning the MCS field of view, we acquired observations directly over the north pole for every ~2hr orbit over the course of several days. This was repeated during two separate periods in northern winter. The 2 hr sampling frequency enables the detailed study of cloud evolution. These observations were also compared to a cloud-free, control region just off the pole, which was sampled in the same way. Results from this experiment show that the north polar CO2 clouds are dynamic, and appear to follow a consistent pattern: Beginning with a relatively clear atmosphere, the cloud rapidly grows to ~25 – 30 km altitude in < 2 hr. Then, the altitude of the cloud tops diminishes slowly, reaching near the surface after ~6 – 10 hr. We interpret this slow decay as the precipitation of snow particles, which constrains their size to be ~10 – 100 μm. Also pervasive in this season are water ice clouds, which may provide condensation nuclei for the CO2. The interplay between these two atmospheric aerosol species on short timescales is a potentially fruitful area of future research, enabled by these unique observations.\nPart of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

One of the resulting modes is MJO-like, with an 11-pentad period and a 3-pentad decay time. We have separately used a variety of criteria to identify several MJO events during boreal winters 1998-2012 for individual examination. Here we explore how the MJO-like mode evolves during these cases in multiple ways. We track the contributions to that mode by upper- and lower-level zonal winds and latent heating (as proxied by Outgoing Longwave Radiation, OLR), as well as the contributions made by mid-tropospheric temperature (T400) and sea-level pressure (SLP) in the pre-cursor and early stages of the events. We also examine the stochastic forcing of these cases using diagnostics based on fluctuation-dissipation theory, and compare the characteristics of this forcing during the early stages of several MJO events.",

            "abstract": "Prominences are relatively cool structures composed of over-dense plasma that are observed in the corona. Their properties are significantly diverse, making them difficult to understand. During this investigation, we examined data from the Solar Dynamic Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) at 304 Å and 171 Å to observe the behavior of a prominence on the day of its eruption, 13 June 2010. We measured the height of the cavity over time to estimate its rise velocity. This was found to be not constant and followed an exponential rise. We found that the best way to determine the velocity was to split the fit into a two-part velocity. Initially the rise was <5 km/s but this quickly increased to ~15-47 km/s. We investigated the prominence mass using SDO/AIA 304 Å data to look at the area of the structure, and estimated the length by looking at previous H-alpha data. From this we had a rough volume and using a standard value of prominence density we estimated the upper limit of the mass to be 9.42 x 1010 kg. Next, we used the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to study the magnetic field strength in the area around the prominence between the 5-14 of June and found that the total absolute magnetic field (|B|) over the days was decreasing. Lastly, we used the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead spacecraft (STEREO-A) in the 195 Å and 304 Å wavelength to look at our prominence eruption using a different point of view. Examining mass and magnetic field can help us understand the trigger mechanism of this prominence. Unfortunately, this is not enough information to determine the exact cause of the eruption. Looking at future works, we can study more aspects about the sun that can be relevant in this kind of situation.",

            "abstract": "The spectral properties of scalar turbulence at high wavenumbers have been extensively studied in turbulent flows, and existing theories explaining the k–5/3 scaling within the inertial subrange appear satisfactory at high Reynolds numbers. Equivalent theories for the low wavenumber range have been comparatively lacking because boundary conditions prohibit attainment of such universal behavior. A number of atmospheric surface layer (ASL) experiments reported a k–1 scaling in air temperature spectra ETT(k) at low wavenumbers but other experiments did not. Here, the occurrence of a k–1 scaling in ETT(k) in an idealized ASL flow across a wide range of atmospheric stability regimes is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Experiments reveal a k–1 scaling persisted across different atmospheric stability parameter values (ζ) ranging from mildly unstable to mildly stable conditions (–0.1< ζ < 0.2). As instability increases, the k–1 scaling vanishes. Based on a combined spectral and co-spectral budget models and upon using a Heisenberg eddy viscosity as a closure to the spectral flux transfer term, conditions promoting a k–1 scaling are identified. Existence of a k–1 scaling is shown to be primarily linked to an imbalance between the production and dissipation rates of half the temperature variance. The role of the imbalance between the production and dissipation rates of half the temperature variance in controlling the existence of a ‘-1’ scaling suggests that the ‘-1’ scaling in ETT(k) does not necessarily concur with the ‘-1’ scaling in the spectra of longitudinal velocity Euu(k). This finding explains why some ASL experiments reported k–1 in Euu(k) but not ETT(k). It also differs from prior arguments derived from directional-dimensional analysis that lead to simultaneous k–1 scaling in Euu(k) and ETT(k) at low wavenumbers in a neutral ASL.",

            "abstract": "Evaluating at high spatial-resolution the topographical and ecological structures of the critical zone (CZ) are now routine with aerial LiDAR. Here we evaluated the eco-hydrological differences of topographic metrics (the independent variables) versus individual tree and gridded aboveground carbon (AGC) pools (as dependent variables) at multiple length-scales across an elevation modified gradient of precipitation and temperature in the Boulder Creek CZ Observatory Watershed, Colorado USA. We describe the responses in AGC within the context of a three-zone eco-hydrological model, e.g. toe slope and valley bottoms (Zone 1), transitional hillslopes (Zone 2), and upper slopes to ridges (Zone 3). In a GIS we compared three separate zero-order basins: (1) the Betasso Preserve: 1,810-2,024 meters above mean sea level (m aμsl), area = 0.45 km2, n = 17,286 trees; (2) Upper and Lower Gordon Gulch: 2,446-2,737 m aμsl, area = 3.57 km2, n = 178,469 trees; and (3) Como Creek: 2,900m-3,560 m aμsl, area = 6.64 km2, n = 317,274 trees. In each of the three catchments Zone 1 held the greatest mean AGC (μ = 52.88-60.97 Mg C ha-1) and maximum AGC (99% confidence interval (CI, p = 0.01) = 152.95-184.95 Mg C ha-1) relative to Zone 2 (μ = 27.84-44.52 Mg C ha-1, 99% CI = 99.67-122.4 Mg C ha-1) and Zone 3 (μ = 12.63-30.33 Mg C ha-1, 99% CI = 62.16-92.65 Mg C ha-1). Topography with negative general curvatures (i.e. convergent shapes) had greater AGC (μ = 73.7-96.3 Mg C ha-1, 99% CI = 189.0-355.8 Mg C ha-1) than positive general curvatures (i.e. divergent shapes) (μ = 17.4-30.8 Mg C ha-1, 99% CI = 88.2-120.4 Mg C ha-1), but only when evaluated at longer length scales (<10 m). Larger AGC pools are postulated to be related to (1) increased soil depth which provides larger rooting zones and (2) access to groundwater along Zone 1, vs Zones 2 and 3 which have (a) shallower soils and (b) less or zero accessibility to groundwater.",

            "abstract": "To assess the stability of ground during gas production from hydrate bearing sediments, it is of fundamental importance that the constitutive model employed and the computational procedure adopted are capable and accurate. One way to establish credence is to investigate if observation from laboratory tests could be reproduced in analysis. From this consideration, this study modeled laboratory triaxial tests in which hydrate dissociation was induced when a certain level of shear stress was reached. During the dissociation, however, both the axial and the confining stresses were kept unchanged. There were basically two scenarios observed: If the applied shear stress was higher than the shear strength of the hydrate free host soil, failure would take place during the dissociation; otherwise the sample would remain stable. The dissociation was induced either by a temperature raise or through pore pressure reduction. To model such tests, a coupled procedure was employed: the geomechanical analysis was conducted in FLAC3D, and the multiphase flow was conducted in TOUGH+. In this study, an SMP critical state constitutive model was implemented in the FLAC3D. This study successfully reproduced the observation from the laboratory tests. It showed that if the dissociation was caused by temperature change alone, failure would take place during dissociation. On the other hand, the modeling results also showed that if the dissociation was induced by pressure reduction, a sample could remain stable during dissociation because the effective confining stress was raised, but it would fail afterwards when the pre-association fluid pressure was allowed to return and the pace of hydrate reformation lagged behind.",

            "abstract": "Time reversal is a powerful tool to image directly both the location and mechanism of sources. This technique assumes seismic velocities in the medium and propagates time-reversed observations of ground motion from each receiver location. Assuming an accurate velocity model and adequate array aperture, the waves will focus at the source location. Although multiple sensors are used simultaneously to estimate the source parameters, we can only image temporally compact sources due to a technical limitation of back projection. In this study, we propose a new approach for passive seismic migration that contains crosscorrelation within the time-reversal scheme. We first individually extrapolate wavefields at each receiver, and then crosscorrelate these wavefields (as a product in the frequency domain: Geometric-mean RTM, GmRTM). Because of the correlation, we can accumulate the energy of sources along the time axis in the image domain and enhance the source signals when the source has extended duration. As a test of this technique, we apply our RTM to synthetic earthquake waveforms and low-frequency earthquakes in Mexico. Results in Guerrero are compared with tectonic tremor locations determined with an independent technique, namely the Tremor Energy and Polarization (TREP) method. We successfully improve the SNR of the source image compared with conventional time-reversal imaging.",

The physical processes that influence the localization and intensity of these precipitation corridors often have an adverse effect on precipitation in surrounding areas, which increases their regional hydrologic importance. In this talk, we review observational studies of the climatological aspects of these multiday heavy midlatitude precipitation corridors confined to narrow latitudinal widths (< 5 degrees). We also present sensitivity studies with high-resolution convection-allowing models. Comparisons of these different simulations allows us to examine the relative importance of 1) external large-scale factors and 2) internal factors related to repeated precipitation episodes over the same location on determining the intensity and longevity of the heavy precipitation corridors.",

            "abstract": "Deeply incised canyons are some of the most dramatic features of landscapes carved by megafloods. The geometry of these canyons may reveal information regarding flood magnitudes during the last ice age on Earth and the volume of water flowing on early Mars. Canyons on both planets have been alternatively modeled as ‘channels’, where the modern topography was completely inundated with water to the elevation of the canyon rims, or as ‘valleys’ that were progressively incised by lesser discharges. Here we combine numerical flood simulations and sediment transport mechanics to explore the hydraulic implications that result from modeling the canyons as ‘channels’ versus ‘valleys’. Over 300 floods were simulated for Moses Coulee, a 60 km-long canyon in the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington, USA, using a 2D, depth-averaged hydraulic model. We simulated floods with discharges ranging from 0.1 million m3 s-1 to 6 million m3 s-1 using both the modern landscape as a topographic boundary condition and synthetic topographies that restored the canyon floor to different elevations as guided by strath terraces. For each simulation we tracked whether shear stresses on the terrace treads exceeded thresholds for sliding of basalt columns. Simulations using the modern topography indicate shear stresses were sufficiently high to erode the terraces at discharges lower than bankfull, and surprisingly, shear stresses decrease with increasing discharge at some sites due to backwater dynamics, which constrains canyon formation to moderate discharges. Simulations performed on the synthetic topography suggest the canyon could have been incised progressively by floods smaller than those required to fill the canyon to bankfull stage. These results suggest the canyons can be viewed as valleys that incised progressively, as opposed to channels filled with water, which has implications for placing bounds on paleoflood hydraulic reconstruction on Earth and Mars.",

            "abstract": "Almost 40 million people living in the arid western U.S. depend on the Colorado River. The high demand, recent drought, and paleoclimatic studies documenting long, severe droughts have spurred numerous studies on the drivers of Colorado River flow. Understanding low-frequency variability and trends in a large and complex basin like the Upper Colorado (UCRB), which contributes the vast majority of Colorado River flow, requires long, high-spatial resolution climatological records. However, researchers sometimes find discrepancies between long climate data products and hydrological records. One explanation for such disparities is the composition of the climate data record. The National Center for Environmental Information’s Master Station History Report (MSHR) documents significant changes in the number and spatial distribution of weather stations within the UCRB. These shifts are reflected in the basin-average station elevation, which has varied by over 300m since 1950 and by over 365m since 1875. Strong elevation and aspect controls on both temperature and precipitation combined with the high degree of variability in station location could drive trends in gridded products in the absence of real climatological trends, although differences in base data, spatial resolution and gridding algorithms can complicate comparisons. Yet limiting analysis to only those stations with long, consistent records is impractical and would be problematic as station density in the early part of the record was not sufficient to characterize the basin. Here we document changes in station coverage within the UCRB and identify the degree to which coverage may have influenced climatic trends.",

            "abstract": "Making credible projections of future changes in extreme events has been challenging because it requires not only running climate models at high resolution to faithfully reproduce impact-relevant extreme events, but also ensemble sizes on the order of 10³ and greater to obtain reliable statistics on the intensity and frequency of extreme events. Due to sparsity of high-resolution data, most studies have used fitted analytical probability distributions to produce statistics for extreme events, which in itself has limitations and uncertainties. Here we present results of a superensemble of simulations generated by weather@home, a citizen science computing platform, where Western United States climate was simulated for the recent past (1985-2014) and future (2030-2059) using a coupled regional/global model (HadRM3P/HadAM3P) at 25-km resolution. The very large number of simulations permits the detection of robust spatial patterns of anthropogenically forced change, amidst the “noise” of natural variability, in extremes in daily temperature and precipitation. We investigate to what extent extreme events change in frequency and intensity, relative to changes in the means. Also, the physical mechanisms underlying such changes are explored. We also compare projected daily extreme temperature and precipitation from weather@home with those from regional/global coupled model parings from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), whereby statistics (e.g. 20-year, 50-year, etc., return values) are estimated from fitted extreme value distribution.",

            "abstract": "The parallel energization of polar cap outflow (PCO) has been shown to be highly effective along newly-created lobe lines where the geometry is such that the Coulomb force due to the dawn-to-dusk electric field is roughly parallel to the curvature drift of the ions. This “Coulomb-curvature” interaction can produce a parallel energization rate that raises the parallel energy of the ions to about 5-6 keV before they reach the Neutral Sheet (NSh) at about 11 earth radii downtail. Then, in the outer NSh, they produce a strong westward curvature current. When they enter the inner neutral sheet (INSh) where they become “unmagnetized”, they are accelerated westward by the dawn-dusk electric field. This causes their perpendicular energy and their pitch angle to increase such that the ions essentially become trapped in the inner NSh while continuing to accelerate westward. This additional westward current in the inner NSh accompanies the westward curvature current produced in the two outer NSh layers. This total ion current is supplemented by the westward curvature current caused by the eastward curvature drift of the electrons. The combined total ion and electron current is sufficient to severely decrease the magnetic field near the earthward end of the NSh. The magnetic pressure decrease is compensated by the particle pressure increase due to inflow of oxygen ions from the northern and southern polar caps. The conditions near the earthward edge of the NSh and in the adjoining plasmasheet regions neighbouring the NSh become ideal for reconnection and the dipolarization that follows.",

One major problem in dams’ impact studies is the lack of reliable methods for simulating reservoir operation. We have used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to parameterize actual dam operations and developed a General Reservoir Operation Scheme (GROS) which may be added to daily hydrologic routing models for simulating the releases from dams in regional and global-scale studies. GROS is sufficiently accurate in simulating the operation of existing reservoirs and is specifically designed to provide a broad perspective of the general behavior of dams and improve the understanding of the large-scale hydrological impact of dams operation in a relatively easy and efficient way. Embedding GROS in a water balance model (WBMplus), we are analyzing the hydrological impact of dams on the thirteen states of the Northeastern United States. Our analysis shows the changing trends in hydrological characteristics of each state for the period of 1950 to 2099 under the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We demonstrate how the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum monthly flows change as a result of climate change and explore the role of reservoirs in that change. In addition, we investigate whether building new dams can provide engineered resilience to climate change and enhance future water security.",

The majority of the data have been provided by “citizen scientists” participating in a national-scale, multi-taxa phenology observation program, Nature’s Notebook. Since 2008, more than 5,500 active participants registered with Nature’s Notebook have contributed over 5.5 million observation records for plants and animals. This presentation will demonstrate several types of questions that can be addressed by engaging citizen scientists in a standardized national monitoring system focused on field observations of biodiversity. Because the proof is often in the pudding, we will feature a diversity of recently published studies, but will also highlight several new and ongoing local- to continental-scale projects. Projects include continental bioclimatic indices, regional assessments of historical and potential future trends in phenology, sub-regional assessments of temperate deciduous forest response to recent variability in spring-time heat accumulation, state- and management unit- level foci on spatio-temporal variation in organismal activity at both the population and community level, and local monitoring for invasive species detection across platforms from ground to satellite. Additional data-mining and exploration by interested researchers and/or resource managers will likely further demonstrate the value of these data.

            "abstract": "Robustness analyses of water supply systems have moved toward exploratory simulation to discover scenarios in which existing or planned policies may fail to meet stakeholder objectives. Such assessments rely heavily on the choice of plausible future scenarios, which, in the case of drought management, requires sampling or generating a broad ensemble of reservoir inflows which do not necessarily reflect the historical record. Here we adapt a widely used synthetic streamflow generation method to adjust the frequency of low-flow periods, which can be related to impactful historical events from the perspective of decision makers. Specifically, the modified generation procedure allows the user to specify parameters n, p such that events with observed weekly non-exceedance frequency p appear in the synthetic scenario with approximate frequency np (i.e., the pth percentile flow occurs n times more frequently). Additionally, the generator preserves the historical autocorrelation of streamflow and its seasonality, as well as approximate multi-site correlation. Using model simulations from recent work in multi-objective urban drought portfolio planning in North Carolina, a region whose water supply faces both climate and population pressures, we illustrate the decision-relevant consequences caused by raising the frequency of low flows associated with the 2007-2008 drought. This method explores system performance under extreme events of increasing frequency prior to reconciling these findings with climate model projections, and thus can be used to support bottom-up robustness methods in water systems planning.",

            "abstract": "The lower boundary of soil has been a point of contention among soil scientists for decades. Recent evidence suggests that soil is much deeper than is measured by many ecological studies and that arbitrary definitions of maximum soil depth unnecessarily exclude important regions of the soil profile. This paper provides illustrated examples of soil profiles that have important deep soil characteristics or buried horizons. Soil pits were excavated with a backhoe to at least 2.5 m depth at 35 sites throughout the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) ecoregion of the Pacific Northwest. These soils cover four orders – Andisol, Inceptisol, Alfisol, and Ultisol – and highlight the hidden diversity of subsoil characteristics throughout the region. The roots of trees and understory species often extended deep into the C horizons of soil. Despite experiencing less pedogenic development than surface horizons, C horizons are important as the frontier of soil formation, as an important resource for plant growth, and as a repository of diffuse but significant carbon storage. On average, there was 188.1 Mg C ha-1 total across all 35 sites, of which 76.3 Mg ha-1 (40.5%) was found below 0.5 m and 44.4 Mg ha-1 (23.6%) was found below 1 m. There was substantial variability in the vertical distribution of C with as little as 8.0% and as much as 58.0% of total C below 1 m. In some cases, B horizons are far deeper than the 1 or 2 m depth arbitrarily assumed to represent the whole soil. In other cases, subsoil hides buried profiles that can significantly impact total soil carbon stocks as well as aboveground plant growth. These buried horizons are important repositories of nutrients and carbon that are poorly understood and rarely sampled. Ignoring subsoil precludes incorporating soil burial or deep soil processes into biogeochemical and global carbon cycle models, and limits mechanistic understanding of carbon sequestration and mobilization in soil.",

The lattice Boltzmann method, based on microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equations, is particularly well suited for fluid flow simulations involving interfacial dynamics and complex boundaries. In this study, we compare the Shan-Chen and color-fluid model in lattice Boltzmann simulation of multiphase flow in porous media. The original models were proposed two decades ago, and suffer from significant spurious currents as well as other numerical limitations. Therefore, the latest developments of the two models are employed, which allows consideration of density and viscosity contrasts relevant to geological sequestration in saline reservoirs. Previous studies of the comparison of the two models were mostly done in simple geometries, and demonstrated that the Shan-Chen model suffered from more serious numerical errors than the color-fluid model, although the latter is more computationally demanding. The real impact on multiphase flow in porous media has not been studied in detail. In this investigation, we employ realistic fluid parameters and perform numerical simulations in geometries based on micro-CT images of rock cores. The fluid displacement patterns and the relative permeability obtained by simulations will be used to evaluate the two models. The computational cost of the two models will also be presented for comparison.\nThis work was supported as part of the Center for Geologic Storage of CO2, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science.",

First, for each site, we produce P-to-S receiver functions (RFs) organized by backazimuth and epicentral distance, and use them to identify the phase most likely representing a conversion from the Moho. Second, we construct averaged RFs for groups of telesismic events located in a similar geographic region, which we employ to examine shapes of Moho P-to-S converted phases in time series with maximum frequencies increasing from 0.25Hz to 2-3 Hz.\nAt some sites we observe a progressive narrowing of a simple Moho converted phase with an increase in frequency, typical of a vertically instantaneous boundary, while at others the converted phase becomes progressively more complex, typical of a diffuse Moho. Thus, we adopt this difference in converted wave shape dependence on increasing frequency as a measure of Moho thickness.\nOur estimates of Moho thickness range from less than 300 m to over 2 km, with some locations showing evidence for multiple converting boundaries in the 35-50 km depth range. In this study we define “sharp” Moho at those sites where its vertical thickness is less than 1 km.\nOur results show that sharp Moho is universal in the Archean terranes regardless of surface lithology, likely due to higher Moho temperatures facilitating wide-spread delamination of dense lower crustal rocks. While a sharp Moho is not unique to the Superior Province, all Grenville and Appalachians sites where we find sharp Moho are in regions of granitic plutonism, suggesting a possible general association with reworking and density sorting of the crustal material (e.g. volcanic arc).",

            "abstract": "In a brecciated intrusive complex, mineral assemblages from non-ore-stage hydrothermal alteration may be mistakenly associated with ore body emplacement during exploration. The ability to differentiate mineralizing from non-mineralizing alteration by stable isotope analysis, and to map the fluid pathways, is a useful tool for future exploration. The Bull Hill diatreme, central Bear Lodge Mountains, contains porphyritic alkaline clasts and cross-cutting megacrystic sanidine trachyte dikes. The K feldspar (Kfs) phenocrysts reacted with and recorded the passage of hydrothermal fluids, likely derived from post-diatreme carbonatite intrusions. A study of the δ18O values of Kfs in the complex can assist mineralization mapping by revealing the late hydrothermal fluid pathways and provenance. Dike and breccia samples were split from three drill holes at regular distances, moving away from carbonatite dikes and large veins. Eighteen samples were prepared for oxygen isotope analysis by physical separation of megacrysts, or by crushing and hand-picking Kfs fragments from the breccia. A carbonatite Kfs sample was prepared by partial HCl digestion. Oxygen isotope ratios were measured at the Washington State University GeoAnalytical Laboratory using a Finnegan Delta S Mass Spectrometer. Kfs δ18O values range between 7.69‰ and 9.09‰ in the diatreme breccia xenocrysts, 5.28‰ to 8.12‰ in the megacrystic dike phenocrysts, and 7.15‰ in the carbonatite phenocrysts. Results suggest no clear relationship between the δ18O values in Kfs and the different phases of intrusion. This may be due to δ18O variability introduced by zoned and multi-crystal samples, limited variations of δ18O values among intrusion fluids, or that the final carbonatite intrusion pervasively altered all samples within the study area. Therefore, this method may not be particularly useful for identifying potential ore-bearing units in the Bear Lodge Intrusive Complex.",

            "abstract": "During 1995-2012 Wind recorded 168 magnetic clouds (MCs), 197 magnetic cloud-like structures (MCLs), and 358 interplanetary (IP) shocks. Ninety four MCs and 56 MCLs had upstream shock waves. The following features are found: (i) Averages of solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), duration (<Δt>), strength of Bzmin, and intensity of the associated geomagnetic storm/activity (Dstmin) for MCs with upstream shock waves (MCSHOCK) are higher (or stronger) than those averages for the MCs without upstream shock waves (MCNO-SHOCK). (ii) The <Δt> of MCSHOCK events (≈19.6 hr) is 9% longer than that for MCNO-SHOCK events (≈17.9 hr). (iii) For the MCSHOCK events, the average duration of the sheath (<ΔtSHEATH>) is 12.1 hrs. These findings could be very useful for space weather predictions, i.e. IP shocks driven by MCs are expected to arrive at Wind (or at 1 AU) about ~12 hours ahead of the front of the MCs on average. (iv) The occurrence frequency of IP shocks is well associated with sunspot number (SSN). The average intensity of geomagnetic storms measured by <Dstmin> for MCSHOCK and MCNOSHOCK events is -102 and -31 nT, respectively. The <Dstmin> is -78, -70, and -35 nT for the 358 IP shocks, 168 MCs, and 197 MCLs, respectively. These results imply that IP shocks, when they occur with MCs/MCLs, must play an important role in the strength of geomagnetic storms. We speculate as to why this is so. Yearly occurrence frequencies of MCSHOCK and IP shocks are well correlated with solar activity (e.g., SSN). Choosing the right Dstmin estimating formula for predicting the intensity of MC-associated geomagnetic storms is crucial for space weather predictions.",

            "abstract": "Chemical data assimilation in numerical models of the atmosphere is a venture into uncharted territory, into a world populated by a vast zoo of chemical compounds with strongly non-linear interactions. Commonly assimilated observations exist for only a selected few of those key gas phase compounds (CO, O3, NO2), and assimilating those in models assuming linearity begs the question of: To what extent we can infer the remainder to create a new state of the atmosphere that is chemically sound and optimal? In our work we present the first systematic investigation of sensitivities that exist between chemical compounds under varying ambient conditions in order to inform scientists on the potential pitfalls when assimilating single/few chemical compounds into complex 3D chemistry transport models.\nIn order to do this, we developed a box-modeling tool (BOXMOX) based on the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP, http://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/) in which we can conduct simulations with a suite of ‘mechanisms’, sets of differential equations describing atmospheric photochemistry. The box modeling approach allows us to sample a large variety of atmospheric conditions (urban, rural, biogenically dominated, biomass burning plumes) to capture the range of chemical conditions that typically exist in the atmosphere. Included in our suite are ‘lumped’ mechanisms typically used in regional and global chemistry transport models (MOZART, RACM, RADM2, SAPRC99, CB05, CBMZ) as well as the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM, U. Leeds). We will use an Observing System Simulation Experiment approach with the MCM prediction as ‘nature’ or ‘true’ state, assimilating idealized synthetic observations (from MCM) into the different ‚lumped’ mechanisms under various environments. Two approaches to estimate the sensitivity of the chemical system will be compared: 1) adjoint: using Jacobians computed by KPP and 2) ensemble: by perturbing emissions, temperature, photolysis rates, entrainment, etc., in order to create gain matrices to infer the unobserved part of the photochemical system.",

            "abstract": "The debris flow in Mud Creek on September 20, 2014 occurred during a warm spell at the end of an unusually long and hot summer. No precipitation was recorded during or immediately before the event, and it appears to have resulted from rapid glacial melt. It initiated on the toe of the Konwakiton Glacier, and immediately below it. The flow track was small in the upper parts (40 feet wide), but between 8,000 and 10,000 feet in elevation, it entrained a large volume of debris from the walls and bed of the deeply incised gorge and transported it down to the apex of the Mud Creek alluvial fan (4,800’). At that point, it overflowed the channel and deposited debris on top of older (1924) debris flow deposits, and the debris plugged a road culvert 24 feet wide and 12 feet high. A small fraction of the flow was diverted to a pre-existing overflow channel which parallels Mud Creek, about 1,000 feet to the west. The main debris flow traveled down Mud Creek, confined to the pre-existing channel, but locally got to within a foot or so of overflowing the banks. At elevation 3920’, video was taken during the event by a private citizen and placed on YouTube. The video revealed that the flow matrix consisted of a slurry of water/clay/silt/sand/gravel, transporting boulders 1-6 feet in diameter along with the flow. Cobble-sized rock appears to be absent.\nSieve analysis of the debris flow matrix material revealed a fining of particles in a downstream direction, as expected. The thickness of deposits on the fan generally decreased in a downstream direction. Deposits were 5-6 feet deep above the Mud Creek dam, which is at 4,800’ elevation, and 4-5 feet deep at the dam itself. Further downstream, thicknesses decreased as follows: 3920’aqueduct crossing, 3-4 feet; 3620’ Pilgrim Creek Road crossing, 2-3 feet; 3,520’, 1-2 feet; 3,440’ abandoned railroad grade, 1 foot. \nThis event damaged roads, and future events could threaten life and property. There is a need to better understand local glacial melt processes to predict such events. USGS LiDAR (2011) is available, and the US Forest Service will acquire LiDAR for Mud Creek later in 2015. These data sets will allow a quantitative measure of changes in the glaciers and channel network, as well as the amount of erosion and deposition which occurred in 2014. This information will facilitate a sound assessment of potential future hazards.",

            "abstract": "Arctic warming will amplify climate change especially if thawing tundra emits increasingly greater amounts of CO2 and CH4 due to rising temperatures in the coming decades. However, uncertainties about flux rates and sources limit the prediction of these feedbacks. The few observations of tundra carbon fluxes during snowmelt suggest that there may be large releases during spring thaw, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms and whether emissions of greenhouse gases are widespread enough to influence atmospheric concentrations. To address this question we employed a multi-scale approach, including ecosystem-scale measurements, a mechanistic soil-core thawing experiment, and airborne observations of atmospheric carbon concentrations. We show that fluxes during the 2-week period of snow and surface-ice melt in 2014 near Barrow, Alaska, reduced the net snow-free season uptake of CO2 by 46% and added 6% to the CH4 emissions. A controlled laboratory experiment revealed that when frozen permafrost was exposed to warming temperatures, it released an immediate, large pulse of CO2 and CH4 that had been trapped under the surface ice. While the Alaskan North Slope was undergoing snowmelt, changes in the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 measured by aircraft were correlated to fluxes of CO2 and CH4 measured by eddy-covariance. Airborne measurements from the aircraft reflected local observations, and confirmed that the pulse had influence on regional atmospheric concentrations. This research suggests that the Arctic carbon spring pulse is a result of a delayed release of biogenic production in fall, and that this pulse is widespread and large enough to offset a significant fraction of the moderate Arctic tundra carbon sink.",

            "abstract": "The discovery of water ice and perchlorates in the shallow subsurface of Mars [1,2] is interesting because they could produce aqueous liquid solutions under Mars’ present-day environmental conditions.\nWe used the Michigan Mars Environmental Chamber [3] to simulate the pressure, temperature and relative humidity during the full diurnal cycle of sol 19 at the Phoenix landing site. Sol 19 was chosen because on this sol ice found in a shallow trench (Dodo-Goldilocks) at a depth of ~5 cm was removed with little effort [4], suggesting that it was a frozen brine (softer than freshwater ice), and because oblate spheroids found on a strut of the lander, possibly a saline mud, were observed to grow and darken (suggesting liquefaction) [4].\nThe results of our simulations show that early in the mission the frozen brine likely found in the Dodo-Goldilocks trench could melt in the morning, temporarily forming aqueous liquid solutions when the temperature in the trench was above the eutectic temperature of the Ca(ClO4)2 salt (~199 K). In addition, the results of our simulations indicate that the spheroids observed on a strut of the Phoenix lander were most likely droplets of liquid brines.\nSince halophilic terrestrial bacteria thrive in brines [5], our results suggest that Mars’ polar region could potentially be a habitat for microorganisms. In addition, it has been suggested that frost could form on fine-grained terrains at Gale crater during the winter [6]. If this frost gets in contact with perchlorate salts, it could melt temporarily forming liquid brines.",

            "abstract": "The Dawn team divided the surface of Ceres into fifteen quadrangles to facilitate systematic geological mapping, which is a tool used to methodically observe and interpret the surfaces of planetary bodies. Here we present a geological map of Ezinu quadrangle, along with initial interpretations of the quadrangle’s geological history. Ezinu quadrangle is located from 21-66°N and 180-270°E and includes the following dominant features. (1) Ezinu crater (120 km diameter), which contains a cluster of small craters, sinuous grooves and mass wasting deposits in its interior. Ezinu crater is associated with dark mantling material, which corresponds to the northern part of the HST #8 dark albedo region observed by Li et al. (2006). (2) The northern portion of Occator crater (92 km diameter), which is associated with dark mantling material that we interpret as Occator ejecta. This dark mantling material corresponds to part of the HST #10 dark albedo region observed by Li et al. (2006). (3) Northwest-striking crater chains and grooves, which cross-cut the southern part of Ezinu quadrangle. It is possible that the crater chains and grooves were formed by material ejected during formation of the Yalode and/or Urvara impact craters in the southern hemisphere. In addition, Ezinu quadrangle is located in one of two possible source regions of water vapor detected around Ceres (Küppers et al., 2014). Ongoing work will include the identification of possible water vapor source regions and the development of a detailed geological history of the quadrangle. Currently, the geological mapping is based on Approach (~1.3 km/pixel) and Survey (~400 m/pixel) mosaics of clear and color filter data from the Dawn spacecraft’s Framing Camera. In addition, shape models derived from Framing Camera data are used as a mapping aid. Dawn will begin the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) in mid-August, and our geological mapping will incorporate the higher resolution HAMO mosaics (~140 m/pixel).",

            "abstract": "Water resource managers throughout the Western United States have struggled with persistent and severe drought since the early 2000s. In California, a historic 4-year drought period has resulted in just under 50% of the state experiencing exceptional drought conditions, and record low snowpack levels in the Sierra Nevada region; additionally, the drought has cost the California agricultural community approximately $3 billion in losses. In the Colorado River Basin, nearly 80% of the basin is in drought, as record low levels at Lake Mead threaten to impose the first ever water shortage in the Lower Colorado River Basin and threaten a portion of the nearly $960 billion economy dependent on water from the Colorado River. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) describes warming sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean that typically correlate with cool and wet precipitation events in California and the Lower Colorado River Basin during an El Niño event. Past research indicates the potential to identify analog ENSO events to evaluate the impact to water resources in the Western U.S. Two of California’s wettest winters have occurred during the strong El Nino events of 1982 - 1983 and 1997 – 1998. The 1982 – 1983 event also corresponded with one of the wettest years on record in the Colorado River Basin. Current forecasts indicate the potential for one of the strongest El Niño events on record this winter.\nIn this study, remotely sensed precipitation is utilized and compared to past ENSO events in an effort to identify possible hydroclimatic and water supply impacts to California and the Colorado River Basin. Western U.S. snowpack and precipitation events are further compared to streamflows in the region and the potential for extreme (i.e., flooding) events in an effort to inform water resource managers throughout the Western U.S.",

During these campaigns, we made extensive measurements of photosynthetic capacity—Vcmax and Jmax—and their temperature sensitivities across a range of sites, crop types and environmental conditions. Our objectives were to characterize the physiological diversity of agricultural vegetation in California and develop generalizable algorithms to map these physiological parameters across several image acquisitions, regardless of crop type and canopy temperatures. We employed AVIRIS imagery to scale and estimate the vegetation parameters and MASTER surface temperature to provide context, since physiology responds exponentially to leaf temperature. We demonstrate a segmentation approach to disentangling leaf and background soil temperature, and then illustrate our retrievals of Vcmax and Jmax during overflight conditions across a large number of the 2013-2015 HyspIRI acquisitions. Our results show >80% repeatability (R2) across split sample jack-knifing, with RMSEs within 15% of the range of our data. The approach was robust across crop types (e.g., grape, almond, pistachio, avocado, pomegranate, oats, peppers, citrus, date palm, alfalfa, melons, beets) and leaf temperatures.

            "abstract": "Although fission track geochronology has been successfully used to date volcanic glasses and tephras in several studies, a variety of approaches have been used (see Westgate et al., 2013), and no consensus for a standardized methodology has emerged. As a result, this technique is rarely employed, despite having the potential to date tephras and glasses that cannot be dated by other methods, such as K-Ar dating. We have been evaluating the various approaches used to address the technical issues in fission track dating of tephras, by applying them to standards of known ages, including Moldavite tektite, and Huckleberry and Bishop Tuffs. Some of these issues include track etching and counting protocol, and corrections for the effects of track fading at low temperatures. Track etching is generally done in 24% HF for 75 or more seconds, but the time necessary for optimal etching appears to vary according to sample composition and grain size. To correct for track fading, we are using the diameter correction technique of Sandhu and Westgate (1995). We have obtained tephra samples from two regions, the Afar Depression in Ethiopia, an area with significant early hominid fossils, and the Denali fault zone in Alaska, an area with a complicated tectonic evolution. For both of these regions, we have samples that have been dated by other methods for calibration purposes, and we will explore the application of a Zeta correction to the technique. This underutilized technique can provide powerful constraints on studies of timing in diverse geologic environments.",

            "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of solar irradiance are required for electric utilities to economically integrate substantial amounts of solar power into their power generation portfolios. A common shortcoming of numerical weather models is the prediction of marine boundary layer clouds such as over the California coast as boundary layer processes are not resolved well. There are two turbulence parameterizations employed in the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The MYNN scheme is based on the turbulent kinetic energy that is explicit calculated in the model while the YSU scheme produces the exchange coefficients based on K-profiles for unstable and stable conditions. The microphysical and dynamical characteristics of marine boundary layer clouds are compared between two turbulence parameterizations and then sensitivity tests are conducted to enhance the exchange coefficients for momentum and heat. The results from the simulations show that increasing the exchange coefficient leads to enhanced vertical mixing and a deeper mixed layer over both sea and land surfaces. In this condition, clouds become deeper increasing cloud lifetime and reducing surface irradiance. These changes will reduce the bias of day-ahead solar forecasting over coastal California.",

According to the World Resources Institute, floods impact 21 million people every year and affect the global GDP by $96 billion. Providing accurate flood maps in near-real time (NRT) is critical to their utility to first responders. Also, in times of flooding, river gauging stations on location, if any, are of less use to monitor stage height as an approximation for water surface area, as often the stations themselves get washed out or peak water levels reach much beyond their design measuring capacity.\nIn a joint effort with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the European Commission Joint Research Centre and the University of Alabama, the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) measures NRT: 1) river discharges, and 2) water inundation extents, both with a global coverage on a daily basis. Satellite-based passive microwave sensors and hydrological modeling are utilized to establish ‘remote-sensing based discharge stations’. Once calibrated, daily discharge time series span from 1998 to the present. Also, the two MODIS instruments aboard the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites provide daily floodplain inundation extent with global coverage at a spatial resolution of 250m.\nDFO’s mission is to provide easy access to NRT river and flood data products. Apart from the DFO web portal, several water extent products can be ingested by utilizing a Web Map Service (WMS), such as is established with for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region through the GeoSUR program portal. This effort includes implementing over 100 satellite discharge stations showing in NRT if a river is flooding, normal, or in low flow.\nNew collaborative efforts have resulted in flood hazard maps which display flood extent as well as exceedance probabilities. The record length of our sensors allows mapping the 1.5 year, 5 year and 25 year flood extent. These can provide key information to water management and disaster response entities.",

Clearly we would like use as much of the available data as possible to parameterize the simulations, so that a consistent picture of the heliosphere may emerge. However, since the simulations obtain a solution to the boundary value problem, we only have freedom to manipulate the boundaries -- in the inner heliosphere and in the interstellar medium. Here we demonstrate how conditions in the interstellar medium can be used to satisfy various observed quantities in the heliosphere. We show that certain assumption about the interstellar medium correctly predict several observed features, while other assumptions may satisfy only one observation while leading to incorrect predictions for others. The goal is to identify those boundary conditions that result in the broadest agreement with observations.",

Recent work suggests that competing models for saltation (the characteristic hopping of aeolian sediment) fail because they do not adequately account for wind turbulence. To address this issue, we performed field deployments measuring high-frequency co-variations of aeolian saltation and near-surface winds at multiple sites under a range of conditions. Our observations yield several novel findings not currently captured by saltation models: (1) Saltation flux displays no significant lag relative to horizontal wind velocity; (2) Characteristic height of the saltation layer remains constant with changes in shear velocity; and (3) During saltation, the vertical profile of mean horizontal wind velocity is steeper than expected from the Reynolds stress. We examine how the interactions between saltation and turbulence in field settings could explain some of these surprising observations.",

We use an ocean-water circulation model [1] that shows how pressure gradients drive water to the surface from a relatively gas-rich, subsurface ocean. The model calculates the temperatures, pressures, exsolution, and flow rates throughout the circulation system. We now examine the formation of CO2 gas pockets in the ice close to the surface; the movement of CO2 to the surface; and the subsequent venting of CO2, when at least some of the CO2 freezes to form frost.

            "abstract": "Subaqueous volcanic eruptions comprise only 8% of all recorded eruptions in historical time, but have caused ~20% of fatalities associated with volcanic activity during this time (Mastin and Witter, 2000). Crater lakes, however, act as calorimeters, absorbing heat from intruding magma and integrating it over space and time and thus offer a unique opportunity to monitor volcanic activity. Kawah Ijen is a composite volcano located on east Java, Indonesia, whose crater hosts the largest natural hyperacidic lake (27 x 106 m3; pH <1) on Earth. As part of an international workshop on Kawah Ijen in September 2014, we tested a novel approach for mapping and monitoring variations in crater-lake apparent surface temperatures at high spatial (~30 cm) and temporal (every two minutes) resolution. We used a ground-based thermal infrared (TIR) camera from the crater rim to collect a set of visible imagery around the crater during the daytime and a time series of co-located visible and TIR imagery at one location from pre-dawn to daytime. We processed daytime visible imagery with the Structure-from-Motion photogrammetric method to create a digital elevation model onto which the time series of TIR imagery was orthorectified and georeferenced. Lake apparent surface temperatures typically ranged from ~21 to 28oC. At two locations, apparent surface temperatures were ~ 7 and 9 oC less than in-situ lake temperature measurements at 1.5 and 5 m depth, respectively. We observed large spatio-temporal variations in lake apparent surface temperatures, which were likely associated with wind-driven evaporative cooling of the lake surface. Our approach shows promise for continuous monitoring of crater-lake surface temperatures, particularly if the TIR camera is deployed as part of a permanent station with ancillary meteorological measurements to help distinguish temperature variations associated with atmospheric processes from those at depth within the lake and volcano.",

We use measurements of NOx, RONO2, HNO3, HOx, and VOCs obtained during summer 2013 in rural Alabama as part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) to provide new constraints on the production and loss of biogenic RONO2 and thus to understand their role in setting the NOx lifetime.

            "abstract": "Drought is a dominant climatic feature affecting socio-ecological systems across the U.S. Northern Great Plains. While drought conditions primarily occur in response to periods of low precipitation, they can be exacerbated by enhanced evaporative demand (E0) during periods of elevated temperatures, net radiation, advection, and/or decreased humidity. Our understanding of future drought processes in this region is intrinsically linked to the uncertainty in climate models’ representation of E0 in both historical and future simulations, and this in turn depends on how we choose to calculate E0. While it is generally understood that physically based formulations of E0 such as Penman-Monteith (PM) more appropriately account for the influence of radiative and advective forcings, temperature-based formulations such as the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite equations are often preferred for ecological and hydrological applications due to their simplicity and our higher confidence in input parameters. Here, we assess differences in E0 representation across CMIP5 global climate models using physically and temperature-based formulations of reference evapotranspiration (ETr; i.e., evaporative demand as modeled using a well-watered reference crop). Using daily outputs from the historical runs of selected CMIP5 models, we compare seasonal and annual ETr trends from the PM and Hargreaves formulations over the CONUS and validate these against observational data (U.S. Class-A pan data). Next we use the PM-ETr to compute the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) and evaluate EDDI at weekly and monthly scales in historical simulations over the U.S. Northern Great Plains. We attribute variability, trends, and drought anomalies to each of its driving parameters, to tease out the influence of specific model biases and evaluate geographical nuances of ETr drivers. Our findings will later serve as baseline for the evaluation of drought characteristics in simulations of future climate.",

            "abstract": "Imaging spectroscopy (otherwise known as hyperspectral remote sensing) offers the potential to characterize the spatial and temporal variation in biophysical and biochemical properties of vegetation that can be costly or logistically difficult to measure comprehensively using traditional methods. A number of recent studies have illustrated the capacity for imaging spectroscopy data, such as from NASA’s AVIRIS sensor, to empirically estimate functional traits related to foliar chemistry and physiology (Singh et al. 2015, Serbin et al. 2015). Here, we present analyses that illustrate the implications of those studies to characterize within-field or -stand variability in ecosystem functioning. In agricultural ecosystems, within-field photosynthetic capacity can vary by 30-50%, likely due to within-field variations in water availability and soil fertility. In general, the variability of foliar traits is lower in forests than agriculture, but can still be significant. Finally, we demonstrate that functional trait variability at the stand scale is strongly related to vegetation diversity. These results have two significant implications: 1) reliance on a small number of field samples to broadly estimate functional traits likely underestimates variability in those traits, and 2) if trait estimations from imaging spectroscopy are reliable, such data offer the opportunity to greatly increase the density of measurements we can use to predict ecosystem function.",

            "abstract": "Recent interest in model complexity of complex systems is motivated by opacity of complex models and overfitting leading to low skill. In this work we explore a notion of model complexity of global climate as measured by a suitable function of number of parameters, granularity of relevant data, and targeted forecasting skill (certainty of prediction).\nIn this notion each dataset is associated with typically one to three parameters. Data is coarsened by low-pass filtering. Forecasting skill is assessed by fitting the model to available data up to various values of year Y and comparing its predictions between Y and now with what actually happened.\nAt one extreme we achieve very low model complexity using one parameter relating 60-year-smoothed CO2 to temperature data and a goal of high skill. To maintain skill when data is refined to 20-year smoothing we model the influence of length of day on climate using three parameters, two of which however cannot be separated by the data and hence can be coalesced to one without loss of skill. Further refinement to 10 years is necessary in order to account for the recent hiatus, accomplished with heliomagnetic field data collected by Gauss and others since 1835, which we fit with three parameters.\nThe primary conclusion is that high skill, at least up to the present, is possible with surprisingly simple yet physically plausible models. Using additional data not needed for the foregoing, such as volume of the oceanic mixed layer, we explore circumstances under which the apparent promise of high skill might not be realized in future due to departures from regularities to date such as the RCP8.5 concentration pathway. Of secondary interest, for Y = 1925, 2 years before Arrhenius died, temperature up to the present is significantly underestimated (low temperature skill) but exhibits a hiatus accurately matching today's in both year of onset and duration (high timing skill).\nFurther details at http://clim.stanford.edu/modcomp/",

The evolution of surface temperature implicitly contains the signature of energy partitioning that it can be used to diagnose the surface energy balance. Compared to land surface, energy partitioning over water surface is further complicated by the penetration and absorption of solar radiation in the water body. In this study, we developed a novel analytical method for the reconstruction of surface temperature and for the estimation of all surface energy components, by combining Green’s function approach and linear stability analysis. This new method only requires one single depth measurement of temperature or flux, and applies to the surface energy balance over either land (soil) or water continuum. Model assessment was made against in-situ measurements and numerical predications of the maximum entropy production method, indicating that this approach is robust and of good accuracy. The understanding of the surface energy balance, enabled by this new approach, has been applied to an arid city, viz. Phoenix AZ, to reveal new perspectives of different urban-rural contrasts in terms of thermal and hydrological processes.",

            "abstract": "Yellowstone National Park is unmatched with regard to its quantity of active hydrothermal features. Origins of thermal waters in its geyser basins have been traced to mixing of a deep parent water with meteoric waters in shallow local reservoirs (Fournier, 1989). A mineral-solution equilibrium model was developed to calculate water-rock chemical re-equilibration temperatures in these shallow reservoirs. We use the GeoT program, which uses water composition data as input to calculate saturation indices of selected minerals; the “best-clustering” minerals are then statistically determined to infer reservoir temperatures (Spycher et al., 2013). We develop the method using water composition data from Heart Lake Geyser Basin (HLGB), for which both chemical and isotopic geothermometers predict a reservoir water temperature of 205°C ± 10°C (Lowenstern et al., 2012), and minerals found in drill cores in Yellowstone’s geyser basins. We test the model for sensitivity to major element composition, pH, Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) and selected minerals to optimize model parameters. Calculated temperatures are most accurate at pH values below 9.0, and closely match the equilibrium saturation indices of quartz, stilbite, microcline, and albite. The model is optimized with a TIC concentration that is consistent with the mass of diffuse CO2 flux in HLGB (Lowenstern et al., 2012). We then use water compositions from other thermal basins in Yellowstone in search of spatial variations in reservoir temperatures. We then compare the calculated temperatures with various SiO2 and cation geothermometers.",

            "abstract": "The source and cycling of trace metals and nutrients in coalbed methane (CBM) systems are controlled by both geochemical processes, such as dissolution or precipitation, and biological mediation by microbial communities. CBM production by the microbes is influenced by trace metals and macronutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). Previous studies have shown the importance of these nutrients to both enhance and inhibit methane production; however, it’s not clear whether they are sourced from coal via in-situ biodegradation of organic matter or transported into the seams with groundwater recharge. To address this knowledge gap, trace metal and nutrient geochemistry and the organic content of solid coal and associated groundwater will be investigated across a hydrologic gradient in CBM wells in the Powder River Basin, MT. Sequential dissolution experiments (chemical extraction of organic and inorganic constituents) using 8 core samples of coal and sandstone will provide insight into the presence of trace metals and nutrients in coalbeds, the associated minerals present, and their mobilization. If significant concentrations of N, P, and trace metals are present in core samples, in-situ sourcing of nutrients by microbes is highly probable. The biogeochemical evolution of groundwater, as it relates to trace metal and nutrient cycling by microbial consortia, will be investigated by targeting core-associated coal seams from shallow wells in recharge areas to depths of at least 165 m and across a 28 m vertical profile that include overburden, coal, and underburden. If microbial-limiting trace metals and nutrients are transported into coal seams with groundwater recharge, we would expect to see higher concentrations of trace metals and nutrients in recharge areas compared to deeper coalbeds. The results of this study will provide novel understanding of where trace metals and nutrients are sourced and how they are cycled in CBM systems.",

            "abstract": "The southwest US and northwest Mexico are predicted to become warmer and drier, increasing disturbance, shifting ecosystem composition, and altering global CO2 cycling. However, direct measurements of ecosystem land-atmosphere carbon and water exchange in this region have lagged behind those in wetter regions. In this presentation we present a synthesis of CO2, water, and energy exchanges made at 25 Southwest eddy covariance sites (3-10 years each, n = 174 years). This regional gradient includes desert shrublands, grasslands, savannas, and forests and spans ranges of 200 – 800 mm in mean annual precipitation and 2 – 24 ⁰C mean annual temperature, a climate space that has been underrepresented in flux databases and publications. We compare measured fluxes against state-of-the-art remote sensing and modeling products representing current best regional estimates. We find that 65% of annual net ecosystem production of CO2 (NEP) is explained by water availability. Meanwhile, most of the unexplained NEP variability is related to site-specific differences persisting over the observation years, suggesting slow-changing controls such as demography (plant type, age, structure) and legacies of disturbance. Disturbances that kill plants without removing biomass, such as drought, tend to decrease productivity and increase respiration, shifting sites from carbon sinks to sources. However, following disturbances that removed biomass, such as fire, both productivity and respiration decline, with minimal impacts on NEP. Remote sensing and modeling match mean CO2 uptake measurements across spatial gradients in climate and plant functional type. However, measured uptake reveals 200-400% greater interannual variability than model estimates. High variability and sensitivity to water help us understand why semiarid ecosystems dominate the interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon sink in global accounting studies.",

We coupled landscape, fire, and hydrologic models and forced them using projected climate to demonstrate climate change impacts anticipated at Fort Huachuca in southeastern Arizona, USA.\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes climate change as a trend that has implications for military installations, national security and global instability. The goal of this DoD Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) project (RC-2232) is to provide decision making tools for military installations in the southwestern US to help them adapt to the operational realities associated with climate change.\nFor this study we coupled the spatially explicit fire and vegetation dynamics model FireBGCv2 with the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment tool (AGWA) to evaluate landscape vegetation change, fire disturbance, and surface runoff in response to projected climate forcing. A projected climate stream for the years 2005-2055 was developed from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) 4 km statistical downscaling of the CanESM2 GCM using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. AGWA, an ArcGIS add-in tool, was used to automate the parameterization and execution of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the KINematic runoff and EROSion2 (KINEROS2) models based on GIS layers. Landscape raster data generated by FireBGCv2 project an increase in fire and drought associated tree mortality and a decrease in vegetative basal area over the years of simulation. Preliminary results from SWAT modeling efforts show an increase to surface runoff during years following a fire, and for future winter rainy seasons. Initial results from KINEROS2 model runs show that peak runoff rates are expected to increase 10-100 fold as a result of intense rainfall falling on burned areas.",

The secondary ENA mechanism involves primary ENAs exiting the heliosphere, giving rise to a population of energetic pick-up ions in the outer heliosheath region within a few hundred AU of the heliopause. Several possible scattering scenarios for these pick-up ions then result in a preferential ENA signal from regions where the interstellar magnetic field is close to perpendicular to the line of sight. We will present results from our simulations of the global heliosphere that include a kinetic description of neutral hydrogen. The properties of the source population for outer heliosheath pick-up ions will be shown, along with details of the magnetic field that drapes over the heliopause.

            "abstract": "A wealth of information about the characteristics of Saturn’s ring particles and their regolith can be obtained by modeling the changes in their brightness, color and temperature with changing viewing geometry over a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet through the thermal infrared. Data from Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) are jointly studied using data from the lit and unlit main rings at multiple geometries and solar elevations over 11 years of the Cassini mission. Using multi-wavelength data sets allow us to test different thermal models by combining the effects of particle albedo, regolith grain size and surface roughness with thermal emissivity and inertia, particle spin rate and spin axis orientation.\nThe CIRS temperature and ISS color variations are confined primarily to phase angle over a range of solar elevations with only small differences from changing spacecraft elevation. Color and temperature dependence with varying solar elevation angle are also observed. Brightness dependence with changing solar elevation angle and phase angle is observed with UVIS.\nVIMS observations show that the IR ice absorption band depths are a very weak function of phase angle, out to ~140 deg phase, suggesting that interparticle light scattering is relatively unimportant except at very high phase angles. These results imply that the individual properties of the ring particles may play a larger role than the collective properties of the rings, in particular at visible wavelengths. The temperature and color variation with phase angle may be a result of scattering within the regolith and on possibly rough surfaces of the clumps, as well as a contribution from scattering between individual particles in a many-particle-thick layer. Preliminary results from our joint studies will be presented.\nThis research was carried out in part at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.

Watersheds in the Basin and Range Geological Province are characterized by a variable precipitation regime of wet winters and variable summer precipitation. The relative contributions to groundwater recharge by summer and winter precipitation vary throughout the province, with winter precipitation recharge dominant in the northern parts of the region, and recharge from summer monsoonal precipitation playing a more significant role in the south, where the North American Monsoon (NAM) extends its influence. Stable water isotope data of groundwater and seasonal precipitation from sites in Sonora, Mexico and the U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas were examined to estimate and compare groundwater recharge seasonality throughout the region. Contributions of winter precipitation to annual recharge vary from 69% ± 41% in the southernmost Río San Miguel Basin in Sonora, Mexico, to 100% ± 36% in the westernmost Mojave Desert of California. The Normalized Seasonal Wetness Index (NSWI), a simple water budget method for estimating recharge seasonality from climatic data, was shown to approximate recharge seasonality well in several winter precipitation-dominated systems, but less well in basins with significant summer precipitation.",

Examples of the ground matrix include sands, glacial till, sub-lacustrine diamicton, glaciers and even icy moons. The likely anomalies are cylindrical or spherical water-filled conduits, boulders or saturation bulbs. In such cases refractive focusing within the anomaly may be the cause, whereby waves propagating along the curved surface continually refract along short cuts through the anomaly, which results in enhanced backscatter that emanates from the near the anomaly base. Although Mie scattering and optical ray path propagation of this phenomenon are well understood, the associated backscatter attributes of amplitude, dispersion and phase are not conceptually obvious from the mathematics. Here we try to provide some understanding of these attributes with theory, laboratory experiments with GPR pulses and higher permittivity spheres buried in lower permittivity sand, and numerical models that simulate the experiments. Our experiments clearly show amplitude enhancement of waves whose time delay is predicted by the surface wave explanation, yet with an unexpected reversal of waveform phase polarity. Theoretically we provide a geometrical model that predicts the position of the focal point as a function of the geometric and dielectric parameters, which we evaluate to find those that cause the focus to occur inside the sphere, and the unexpected phase change.",

WRF-Chem simulations are conducted at cloud resolving scales (dx <= 1km), using the MOSAIC bin aerosol scheme, aqueous chemistry, and wet removal in liquid and frozen hydrometeors. A new capability to specify the fraction of each species that is retained in ice upon hydrometeor freezing is added, and sensitivity simulations are compared with observations to determine the best estimate of the retention factor for each species. Furthermore, tracking of solute in individual liquid and frozen hydrometeor classes is implemented in WRF-Chem based on Barth et al. (JGR, 2001). Scavenging efficiencies are calculated from the model and observations using a multi-component mixture model, which includes entrainment of free and upper tropospheric air. The simulations are compared with in-situ trace gas and aerosol observations and ground-based radar wind and hydrometeor fields in order to assess the relative impact of aqueous chemistry, photochemistry, and microphysical transport on the scavenging efficiencies for different species.",

However, the sensitivity of Mg/Ca to salinity is debated; while analysis of foraminifera grown in cultures generally indicates a sensitivity of 3 – 6% per salinity unit, core-top studies have suggested a much higher sensitivity of between 15 – 27% per salinity unit, bringing the utility of Mg/Ca as a SST proxy into dispute. Sediment traps circumvent the issues of dissolution and post-depositional calcite precipitation that hamper core-top calibration studies, whilst allowing the analysis of foraminifera that have calcified under natural conditions within a well constrained period of time. We collated previously published sediment trap/plankton tow G. ruber (white) Mg/Ca data, and generated new Mg/Ca data from a sediment trap located in the highly-saline tropical North Atlantic, close to West Africa. Calcification temperature and salinity were calculated for the time interval represented by each trap/tow sample using World Ocean Atlas 2013 data. The resulting dataset comprises >240 Mg/Ca measurements (in the size fraction 150 – 350 µm), that span a temperature range of 18 – 28 °C and 33.6 – 36.7 PSU. Multiple regression of the dataset reveals a temperature sensitivity of 7 ± 0.4% per °C (p < 2.2*10-16) and a salinity sensitivity of 4 ± 1% per salinity unit (p = 2*10-5). Application of this calibration has significant implications for both the magnitude and timing of glacial-interglacial temperature changes when variations in salinity are accounted for.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean is changing rapidly, partly in response to sea ice loss and partly from other forcings. Here we consider the three main parameters of physical oceanography: temperature, salinity, and momentum. With regard to temperature, the ocean is experiencing enhanced seasonal surface warming each summer as the ice pack retreats and thins. Some of this summer heat can persist through the winter below the surface mixed layer, although enhanced mixing and other processes can act against this survival. Deeper subsurface layers advected into the Arctic from the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans are also warming as these areas respond to warming trends and decadal climate variability. Arctic Ocean warming has implications for the mass balance of the sea ice pack, as well as both marine and coastal terrestrial ecosystems. With regard to salinity, the ocean has just begun to show an overall freshening signal, although with high spatial and temporal variance. This freshening is partly a result of sea ice melt, but also a response to global hydrologic and oceanographic changes. Arctic Ocean freshening enhances the surface stratification, which suppresses upward fluxes of heat and nutrients from below. It also reduces the transfer of momentum (i.e., the stress) from winds to the deep ocean. With regard to momentum, sea ice reduction has created a “looser” ice pack that allows more wind energy to enter the ocean. This effect opposes that of enhanced freshening/stratification when one considers mixing in the upper ocean; the sign and amplitude of the net result is a hot topic in the field. It should also be noted that surface stress in the summer season might actually be declining, as the rough ice pack transitions to a generally smoother sparse pack or open water. In summary, the Arctic Ocean is on the cusp of great change, largely (but not exclusively) forced by changes in the sea ice pack.",

            "abstract": "The City of Santa Barbara, located in coastal southern California, is concerned that excessive groundwater pumping will lead to chloride (Cl) contamination of its groundwater system from seawater intrusion (SWI). In addition, the city wishes to estimate the effect of continued pumping on the groundwater basin under a variety of initial and climatic conditions. A SEAWAT-based groundwater-flow and solute-transport model of the Santa Barbara groundwater basin was optimized to produce optimal pumping schedules assuming 5 different scenarios. Borg, a multi-objective genetic algorithm, was coupled with the SEAWAT model to identify optimal management strategies. The optimization problems were formulated as multi-objective so that the tradeoffs between maximizing pumping, minimizing SWI, and minimizing drawdowns can be examined by the city. Decisions can then be made on a pumping schedule in light of current preferences and climatic conditions. Borg was used to produce Pareto optimal results for all 5 scenarios, which vary in their initial conditions (high water levels, low water levels, or current basin state), simulated climate (normal or drought conditions), and problem formulation (objective equations and decision-variable aggregation). Results show mostly well-defined Pareto surfaces with a few singularities. Furthermore, the results identify the precise pumping schedule per well that was suitable given the desired restriction on drawdown and Cl concentrations. A system of decision-making is then possible based on various observations of the basin’s hydrologic states and climatic trends without having to run any further optimizations. In addition, an assessment of selected Pareto-optimal solutions was analyzed with sensitivity information using the simulation model alone. A wide range of possible groundwater pumping scenarios is available and depends heavily on the future climate scenarios and the Pareto-optimal solution selected while managing the pumping wells.",

            "abstract": "An area of substantial interest is the sensitivity of orographic precipitation to the characteristics of the incoming flow and to the surrounding environment. Some studies have suggested substantial sensitivity of precipitation within individual river drainages for relatively small directional or stability variations of incoming flow. A characterization of such flow sensitivity would be of great value for hydrometeorological prediction, the determination of Probable Maximum Precipitation statistics, and for quantifying the uncertainty in precipitation and hydrological forecasts.\nTo gain insight into this problem, an idealized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system was created in which simulations are driven by a single vertical sounding, with the assumption of thermal wind balance. The actual terrain is used and the full physics complement of the modeling system.\nThe presentation will show how precipitation over the Olympic Mountains of Washington State varies as flow direction changes. This analysis will include both the aggregate precipitation over the barrier and the precipitation within individual drainages or areas. The role of surrounding terrain and the nearby coastline are also examined by removing these features from simulations. Finally, the impact of varying flow stability and speed on the precipitation over this orographic feature will be described.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas are responsible for a large and increasing part of global greenhouse gas emissions. Effective policy for controlling urban emissions depends on an accurate understanding of those emissions, including their trends in time, distribution across source types, and the effects of regulatory, economic, or technological changes on the rate of emissions. The level of detail required will demand input both from bottom-up inventories and from top-down atmospheric concentration measurements, which must then be translated into emissions fluxes. Among the meteorological information needed for that translation, the mixing dynamics of the lower atmosphere are crucial; an error in the depth of the mixed layer produces a proportional error in the flux estimate. Ground-based remote sensing can provide continuous information about the mixed layer. We present results highlighting the importance of such continuous information.\nA Sigma Space mini-Micro Pulse Lidar (miniMPL) and a Vaisala ceilometer were deployed in the Los Angeles megacity, California over a period of several years. A locally appropriate, wavelet-based algorithm was devised to estimate the depth of the mixed layer on the basis of this remote sensing data. A voting scheme, novel for this application, was used to establish confidence. While a seasonal trend in mixed layer depth does exist, that trend is masked by very high day-to-day variability. Daily maximum mixed layer depths often differ by a factor of two from monthly or seasonal averages. We use a simplified model to demonstrate the impact of this variability on top-down approaches to greenhouse gas emissions quantification, demonstrating the value of continuous observations.",

            "abstract": "The advent of biophysical land surface schemes, in which photosynthesis and the structure of plant functional types is modelled explicitly, allows detailed carbon budgets to be simulated in Earth System Models (ESMs), including the response of ecosystems to increasing atmospheric CO2. Projections of future carbon balances are often viewed in terms of enhanced photosynthesis in response to increased atmospheric CO2, the so-called ‘CO2 fertilization effect’, versus increased respiration caused by warming. However, most ESMs do not represent nutrient cycles, most notably nitrogen (N), the availability of which can act as a strong constraint on photosynthesis, and carbon turnover in the soil.\nIn the Canadian ESM (CanESM), surface processes are represented by the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), which models surface energy and water exchanges, coupled with the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM), which models carbon-related processes. We present global and site-level results from incorporating a nitrogen cycle (C-N coupled) into CLASS coupled with CTEM. Flux, forcing and initializing data sets developed by the North American Carbon Program (NACP) and NACP- Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) were used.\nThe C-N coupled model yielded global annual estimates (over 1980-2010) of 122.7 Pg C yr−1 for gross ecosystem production (GEP), and 62.7 Pg C yr−1 for net primary productivity (NPP). Ecosystem respiration (Re) was 119.1 Pg C yr−1 which is about 25% larger than observed, and results in a low estimate of 3.64 Pg C yr−1 for net ecosystem productivity (NEP = GEP – Re). On regional and site-level scales, larger differences were seen between the C-only and C-N coupled model, especially at high latitudes during summer months where N is limiting. Analysis of the long-term annual variations over 1901-2010 also showed different responses to evolving climate, CO2 and N deposition. For 1970-2010, the C-N coupled model indicated a strong N constraint on the rate of increase of GEP and NPP compared to the C-only model.",

The availability of more abundant gas and oil is reshaping the global energy system, with implications for both evolving emissions of CO2 and other climate forcers. More abundant gas and oil will also transform the character of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. We review recent findings regarding the impact of abundant gas and oil for climate forcing and the challenge of emissions mitigation. We find strong evidence that, absent policies to limits its penetration against renewable energy, abundant gas has little observable impact on CO2 emissions, and tends to increase overall climate forcing, though the latter finding is subject to substantial uncertainty. The presence of abundant gas also affects emissions mitigation. There is relatively little literature exploring the implication of expanded gas availability on the difficulty in meeting emissions mitigation goals. However, preliminary results indicate that on global scales abundant gas does not substantially affect the cost of emissions mitigation, even though natural gas could have an expanded role in emissions mitigation scenarios as compared with scenarios in which natural gas is less abundant.",

Over 1,200 km of marine magnetic data were collected in San Pablo Bay along NE-trending traverses spaced 200-m apart, and approximately 200 km of chirp data were collected along similarly oriented profiles spaced 1-km apart. Data were acquired using a 0.7-12 kHz sweep with a 20 ms length fired at 6 times per second. Due to attenuation of the acoustic signal by bay muds and persistent natural gas layers in San Pablo Bay, chirp data are only able to image the upper 2 to 5 meters of the sub-seafloor.\nOffset and warping of near-surface reflections delineates a previously unrecognized NW-trending strand of the Hayward fault that extends across San Pablo Bay, from Point Pinole to Lower Tubbs Island. Vertical offset along the fault varies in both direction and magnitude, with some indication of increasing offset with depth. The fault imaged in the chirp data corresponds to gravity, magnetic, and tomographic gradients in the bay. Relocated seismicity is aligned with the surface trace of the fault and repeating earthquakes along this trend suggest this strand of the Hayward fault is creeping. A northwestward onshore projection of this fault is coincident with gravity and topographic gradients that align with a SSE-trending splay of the Rodgers Creek Fault, suggesting the Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults may connect directly rather than through a wide step-over zone. Even if the faults do not directly connect, these new data indicate that the faults are much closer together (2 km vs 4 km) than previously thought, making a through-going rupture more plausible.",

            "abstract": "Lake Alchichica is a maars type crater-lake located in Central Mexico (pH > 8.9, EC ~13.39 mS cm-1). This limnological system harbors two types of microbialites that can be found around the entire perimeter of the lake (Fig. 1). These structures are representative examples of complex and diverse microbiological assemblages, where microbial activity promotes lithification by trapping, binding and/or precipitating detrital or chemical sediments. Previous studies determined that the microbialites of Lake Alchichica fix N2 to thrive under the N-limiting conditions of the lake, and that these nitrogenase activity peaks are related to heterocystous cyanobacteria that couple photosynthesis to N2 fixation during daylight periods. Heterocystous cyanobacteria (Nostocales) together with Oscillatoriales (non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria) and other cyanobacterial groups have been described as the most abundant cyanobacteria in Alchichica microbialites, and in lithifying mats. Our results suggest that heterocystous cyanobacteria play an important role not only by fixing N2 for biomass construction, but also because their heterocysts host in their external cell membranes main sites for carbonate mineral precipitation including calcium carbonates and siderite. Previous research has shown that the heterocyst is the specialized site for cellular respiration associated to the pH decrease of vegetative/photosynthetic cells, contributing thus to the precipitation of carbonates and the accretion of the organosedimentary structure",

            "abstract": "The presence of oligomers in biomass burning aerosol, as well as secondary organic aerosol derived from other sources, influences particle viscosity and can introduce kinetic limitations to water uptake. This, in turn, impacts aerosol optical properties and the efficiency with which these particles serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). To explore the influence of organic-component viscosity on aerosol hygroscopicity, the water-uptake behavior of aerosol systems comprised of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mixtures of PEG and ammonium sulfate (AS) was measured under sub- and supersaturated relative humidity (RH) conditions. Experiments were conducted with systems containing PEG with average molecular weights ranging from 200 to 10,000 g/mol, corresponding to a range in viscosity of 0.004 – 4.5 Pa s under dry conditions. While evidence suggests that viscous aerosol components can suppress water uptake at RH < 90%, under supersaturated conditions (with respect to RH), an increase in CCN activity with increasing PEG molecular weight was observed. We attribute this to an increase in the efficiency with which PEG serves as a surfactant with increasing molecular weight. This effect is most pronounced for PEG-AS mixtures and, in fact, a modest increase in CCN activity is observed for the PEG 10,000-AS mixture as compared to pure AS, as evidenced by a 4% reduction in critical activation diameter. Experimental results are compared with calculations of hygroscopic growth at thermodynamic equilibrium using the Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients model and the potential influence of kinetic limitations to observed water uptake is further explored with the Kinetic Multi-Layer Model of Gas-Particle Interactions. Results suggest the competing effects of organic-component viscosity and surface-tension depression may lead to RH-dependent differences in hygroscopicity for oligomers and other surface-active compounds present in atmospheric aerosols, for which PEG serves as a surrogate in these experiments.",

AMS radiocarbon analysis of three samples comprising pine-cone scales and needles from a 5-cm-thick faulted layer of organic detritus indicates the earthquake occurred post-320 CAL yr. BP (after A.D. 1630). The dated layer is buried beneath topsoil and a 15-cm-high scarp on the forest floor. Prior to this study, the entire surface-rupturing history of this nascent normal fault was thought to consist of two large events in the late Holocene (West, 1994; Schwartz et al., 2012). The discovery of a third, barely pre-historic, event led us to take a fresh look at geomorphically youthful depressions on the floodplain of the Bear River that we had interpreted as possible evidence of liquefaction. The appearance of these features is remarkably similar to sand-blow craters formed in the near-field of the M6.9 1983 Borah Peak earthquake. We have also identified steep scarps (<2 m high) and a still-forming coarse colluvial wedge near the north end of the fault in Wyoming, indicating that the most recent event ruptured most or all of the 40-km length of the fault.\nSince first rupturing to the surface about 4500 years ago, the Bear River fault has generated large-magnitude earthquakes at intervals of about 2000 years, more frequently than most active faults in the region. The sudden initiation of normal faulting in an area of no prior late Cenozoic extension provides a basis for seismic hazard estimates of the maximum-magnitude background earthquake (earthquake not associated with a known fault) for normal faults in the Intermountain West.",

Of these, Bannu Basin is the least studied and only a handful of publicly accessible datasets and publications are available.\n2D seismic profiles and well data from this area have been recently made public and provide a more comprehensive picture of the structural geology and stratigraphy of the Bannu Basin. Well data analysis plus structural and stratigraphic interpretation of seismic profiles were integrated with existing data from the Bannu Basin to generate structural cross sections and fence diagrams. The fence diagrams indicate the presence of salt and salt diapirism that is concentrated along the Marwat anticline.\nSalt diapirs and transpressive structures were identified at the terminations of wrench zones. Evidence of salt enables the concept that Infra-Cambrian salt may have been the sole detachment for Bannu Basin and not Cambrian shale as previously proposed. A shallower Eocene/Paleocene detachment has also been identified.\nBannu Basin indicates structural and stratigraphic similarities with the Potwar-Salt Range and exhibits thin-skinned deformation. Our results suggest that these similarities are likely due to the presence of salt and its role as a detachment in both regions. Therefore, we consider the Bannu Basin as the western extension of the Potwar-Salt Range and that the Infra-Cambrian salt extends westward of the Kalabagh fault.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the updip spatial overlap of tremor and slip during recent episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events in Cascadia using a combination of forward and inverse models constrained by GPS, strainmeter, and tremor observations. Results from major ETS events in northern Cascadia suggest that, although there is significant spatial overlap, slow slip tends to extend further updip than tremor. ETS activity is thought to be dependent on a range of parameters, such as variable fluid pressures, temperature dependent physical properties, and facies changes. A spatial offset would indicant that tremor and slip are reflective of different physical conditions. While a clear offset of tremor and slip has been observed in multiple other subduction zones, a similar offset in Cascadia has remained difficult to constrain. Here we seek to establish whether the updip spatial offset is real in Cascadia and to quantify its extent.\nTo complement GPS observations in Cascadia, we incorporate high fidelity strainmeter observations into inversions and sensitivity tests of iterative forward models. Tremor distributions are used as a proxy for slip and incorporated into slip models where parameters affecting the distribution and magnitude of slip are allowed to vary. These slip models are used to forward predict surface displacements and strains, which are then compared to the geodetic observations and inferred slip based on geodetic inversions. Results indicate that, while the tremor-derived slip distributions do a good job predicting the broad-scale surface deformation, the best-fit models have slip updip of the peak tremor activity. The fine-scale relationship of tremor and slip appears to vary on an event-by-event basis, where areas of high tremor density do not always correlate with increased surface displacements and vice-versa.",

            "abstract": "The direct and indirect radiative effects of above clouds aerosols (ACA) are still highly uncertain in current climate assessments. Much of this uncertainty is observational as most orbital remote sensing algorithms were not designed to simultaneously retrieve aerosol and cloud optical properties. Recently, several algorithms have been developed to infer ACA loading and properties using passive, single view angle instruments (OMI, MODIS). Yet, these are not operational and still require rigorous validation. Multiangle polarimetric instruments like POLDER, and RSP show promise for detection and quantification of ACA. However, the retrieval methods for polarimetric measurements entail some drawbacks such as assuming homogeneity of the underlying cloud field for POLDER and retrieved cloud effective radii as an input into RSP scheme. In addition, these methods require computationally expensive RT calculations, which precludes real-time polarimetric data analysis during field campaigns.\nHere we describe the development of a new algorithm to retrieve atmospheric aerosol and cloud optical properties from observations by polarimetrically sensitive instruments using Neural Networks (NN), which are computationally efficient and fast enough to produce results in the field. This algorithm is specific for ACA, and developed primarily to support the ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) campaign, which will acquire measurements of ACA in the South-East Atlantic Ocean during episodes of absorbing aerosols above Stratocumulus cloud decks in 2016-18.\nThe algorithm will use a trained NN scheme for concurrent cloud and aerosol microphysical property retrievals that will be input to optimal estimation method.\nWe will discuss the overall retrieval scheme, focusing on the input variables. Specifically, we use principle component analysis (PCA) to examine the information content available to describe the simulated cloud scenes (with adequate noise representation) by using various combinations of the measured and calculated polarimetric variables (total and polarized reflectance or a combination with degree of linear polarization). This sensitivity analysis will examine universal properties relevant to optimal retrieval of cloud properties using multiangle polarimetry.",

            "abstract": "Each year, the arctic sea ice edge retreats from its winter maximum extent through the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ) to its summer minimum extent. On some days, this retreat happens at a rapid pace, while on other days, parts of the pan-arctic ice edge hardly move for periods of days up to 1.5 weeks. We term this stationary behavior “ice edge loitering,” and identify areas that are more prone to loitering than others. Generally, about 20-25% of the SIZ area experiences loitering, most often only one time at any one location during the retreat season, but sometimes two or more times. The main mechanism controlling loitering is an interaction between surface winds and warm sea surface temperatures in areas from which the ice has already retreated. When retreat happens early enough to allow atmospheric warming of this open water, winds that force ice floes into this water cause melting. Thus while individual ice floes are moving, the ice edge as a whole appears to loiter. The time scale of loitering is then naturally tied to the synoptic time scale of wind forcing. Perhaps surprisingly, the area of loitering in the arctic seas has not changed over the past 25 years, even as the SIZ area has grown. This is because rapid ice retreat happens most commonly late in the summer, when atmospheric warming of open water is weak. We speculate that loitering may have profound effects on both physical and biological conditions at the ice edge during the retreat season.",

            "abstract": "The SECARB project is the largest demonstration of CO2 capture, transportation, injection and storage from a coal-fired power station in the US. In August 2012, SECARB began capturing CO2 emitted by Unit 5 at Plant Barry north of Mobile, Alabama and injecting it into the Paluxy Formation at a depth of 9,400 ft above the Citronelle oilfield.\nVertical seismic profile (VSP), cross-well and distributed acoustic sensing using fiber optics are being used to check for CO2 leakage out of the storage reservoir and track the CO2 plume. The acquisition plan includes one pre- and post-CO2 injection survey using an 80-level VSP array with a vibroseis source and cross-well using a piezoelectric source. “Snapshot” VSP surveys are performed every 6-12 months using a shorter 18-level geophone array installed on production tubing in the observation well.\nGood quality results were produced for both the 80-level VSP and cross-well baseline surveys. Mixed results were obtained using the 18-level VSP array due to the smaller aperture, large depth to the target and thin sand layers receiving injected CO2. Time-lapse differencing shows weak illumination at the CO2 injection depth for only one far-offset source point. The lack of bright spots prompted SECARB to move the second cross-well survey up in the schedule. A second cross-well survey was conducted in June 2014. This time the hydrophones were deployed in the production tubing to avoid removing the 18-level array. The acquired data exhibited signal degradation compared to the baseline survey and tube waves interfered with the reflections. First arrivals were used to build a post-injection velocity tomogram. Differencing of the pre- and post-injection tomograms was performed, producing a time-lapse image of good quality. The resulting image (Figure) shows a significant velocity difference, indicating the CO2 plume has moved roughly 400 ft in zone. More importantly, no velocity anomaly or leakage is evident above the storage reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Fractured rocks rich in carbonates can be found as candidates for both reservoirs and seals of importance to GCS; however, the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the fractures are still not fully understood despite its importance for both reservoir rocks, where CO2-induced variations in aperture can significantly change injectivity, as well as seals, where feedbacks between dissolution and flow could lead to either leakage or self-sealing behavior.\nTwo samples, a dolomite and a carbonate rich shale, were analyzed in situ using dynamic synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXR-μCT), flowing CO2-saturated water along a cylindrical sample (~3/8” diameter, ~1” height) with a single fracture along the flow direction. Experiments lasted about one week each, with a constant flow of 5 μl/min under 1400 psi pore pressure and 1700 psi confining pressure. XR tomographic scans were taken at different time steps to monitor the evolution of the fracture characteristics.\nA comparison of the two systems will be presented. In both samples significant dissolution occurs during the experiment, with the development of wormholes clearly visible from segmented fracture aperture maps. Both samples develop a weathered zone on the fracture surface, but the microstructure and the extent of this weathered layer is markedly different. Effluent chemistry analysis and SEM/EDS also help to reveal some time-dependent processes (e.g. increase in the dolomite dissolution rate with time). In both the experiments the crack surfaces becomes enriched in less soluble minerals and some migration of fines is visible as well. The mobilization of clays in the shale sample is unexpectedly small. With the extent of the dissolution allowed by our experiments, no noticeable closing of the fracture due to the confining pressure is visible, and the contact area evolution is barely noticeable.\nPeclet and Dahmköhler numbers for this experiments seem to suggest that the self-sealing behavior observed in prior experiments with carbonate-rich shales is not universal. A very large amount of dissolution would be needed to obtain a significant closure of the fracture. Moreover the evolution of fractures during dissolution is a complicated system where several different processes (which can also be time dependent) need to be taken into account.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis may be generated by subduction zone earthquakes in four ways: (1) elastic seafloor deformation of the upper plate induced by a buried rupture, (2) enhanced seafloor uplift due to splay faulting, (3) seaward motion of the sloping seafloor due to slip-to-trench rupture, and (4) activation of multiple thrusts and back-thrusts due to sudden shortening of the frontal accretionary prism. Cascadia megathrust rupture models previously developed for tsunami hazard assessment include the first two scenarios. The 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake which exhibited dramatic coseismic slip at the trench raised a new question. Can the shallowest portion of the Cascadia megathrust also slip to trench in great earthquakes as in the Tohoku-oki earthquake or would it normally resist coseimic rupture but creep aseismically after the earthquake as in the 2005 Mw 8.7 Nias earthquake? We reanalyzed seismic images from marine multichannel seismic surveys conducted in 1985 and 1989 with a new focus on the accretionary wedge deformation front. The incoming plate at Cascadia is blanketed by ~3km sediment near the deformation front. Off Vancouver Island, deformation style varies along the subduction margin. In a southern portion there are multiple thrusts dipping landward. Half-way north the vergence changes to dominantly back-thrusting. Farther north, in the Explorer segment, both seaward and landward vergent thrusts are present. This is in sharp contrast to the sediment-starved Japan trench where one continuous decollement extends all the way to the trench, a structure style that facilitates slip-to-trench rupture. Given the complex structure at Cascadia’s deformation front, slip-to-trench rupture appears to be much less likely. Scenarios (1) and (4) may be the more likely source scenarios for Cascadia. However, for tsunami hazard assessment, all the rupture scenarios should be considered even for the low probability slip-to-trench rupture scenario involving frontal thrusts with structural details very different from the Japan trench. Therefore, we developed a suit of rupture models using a 3D dislocation model based on the latest structural knowledge, rupture mechanics and observations of recent large tsunamigenic earthquakes such as those at the Sumatra, Chile, and Japan subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Surface energy fluxes are key to the annual summer melt and autumn freeze-up of Arctic sea ice, but are strongly modulated by interactions between atmospheric, ocean, and sea-ice processes. This presentation will examine direct observations of energy fluxes during autumn freeze-up from three recent field programs: the international Arctic Clouds in Summer Experiment (ACSE) on board the R/V Oden in 2014, the Japanese MR14-05 cruise of the R/V Mirai in 2014, and the ONR-funded Sea State cruise of the R/V Sikuliaq in 2015. The R/V Oden obtained measurements in open water and multi-year ice north of the New Siberian Islands, the R/V Mirai’s measurements were at a fixed point near the ice edge in the western Canada Basin, and the measurements from the Sikuliaq were obtained at the advancing ice edge in the Canada Basin/Beaufort Sea. Though measurement types varied, all three cruises made atmospheric measurements with radiosondes and remote sensing at high temporal resolution, obtained measurements or estimates of all terms in the surface energy budget equation, obtained upper-ocean thermodynamic measurements with frequent CTDs, and were able to characterize the evolving air-ocean and air-ice interfaces. The 2014 cruises document processes producing autumnal heat loss in the upper ocean just before and at the very incipient stages of ice formation, while the third cruise documented processes responsible for ice formation during the main freeze-up period. Ocean freeze-up was observed when the near-surface ocean temperature had reached its freezing point and energy loss to the atmosphere continued (Fig. 1). This important loss of energy to the atmosphere from the ocean mixed layer was modulated by a number of local and regional atmospheric processes and some ocean processes, producing significant variability. The different energy budgets over the existing sea ice and adjacent open water also played a major role in the freeze-up processes. This presentation will attempt to quantify the relative impacts of the various processes and provide a coherent scenario for the Arctic autumnal freeze-up from initial ocean heat loss in mid-September to the time when the sea-ice edge approaches the Arctic Ocean coast in early November. Some implications for modelling these processes will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Helium isotopic ratios (3He/4He) observed in mineral springs above the Cascadia forearc provide a marker for fluids derived from Juan de Fuca lithosphere. Sample sites arcward of the forearc mantle corner generally yield significantly higher ratios (~1.5–4.0 R/RA) than those seaward of the corner (~0.3–0.6 R/RA). 3He detected above the inner forearc mantle wedge may represent a mixture of both oceanic lithosphere and forearc mantle sources, whereas 3He detected seaward of the forearc mantle corner likely has only an oceanic source. The highest ratios in the forearc coincide with slab depths (~40–45 km) where metamorphic dehydration of young, warm oceanic lithosphere is expected to release significant fluid and where tectonic tremor occurs, whereas little fluid is expected to be released from the slab (~ 25–30 km depth) beneath sites seaward of the corner.\nHigh helium ratios are also observed in springs and wells in the Nankai and Hikurangi forearcs above the region where tremor and slow slip events are detected. This correlation provides independent evidence that tremor and slow slip are associated with deep fluids, and further suggests that high pore pressures associated with tremor may also serve to keep fractures open for 3He migration through the crust.\nEven though our preliminary results document mantle-derived helium in surface waters of the Cascadia forearc, these results are based on sparse data from sample locations that are not optimally distributed. We have recently identified additional sample sites to investigate whether specific crustal structures in the Cascadia forearc might serve as conduits to speed the ascent of mantle-derived helium. Finally, the possibility of a 3He source related to westward flow of arc-derived fluids through the forearc mantle cannot be ruled out for some of the sites, nonetheless, the highest ratio (4.0 R/RA) is found >130 km from the nearest Cascade Arc volcano making a magmatic source unlikely.",

            "abstract": "The scaling of fault slip events given by the relationship between the scalar moment M0, and duration T, potentially provides key constraints on the underlying physics controlling slip. Many studies have suggested that measurements of M0 and T are related as M0=KfT3 for ‘fast’ slip events (earthquakes) and M0=KsT for ‘slow’ slip events, in which Kf and Ks are proportionality constants, although some studies have inferred intermediate relations. Here ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ refer to slip front propagation velocities, either so slow that seismic radiation is too small or long period to be measurable or fast enough that dynamic processes may be important for the slip process and measurable seismic waves radiate. Numerous models have been proposed to explain the differing M0-T scaling relations. We show that a single, simple dislocation model of slip events within a bounded slip zone may explain nearly all M0-T observations. Rather than different scaling for fast and slow populations, we suggest that within each population the scaling changes from M0  proportional to T3 to T when the slipping area reaches the slip zone boundaries and transitions from unbounded, 2-dimensional to bounded, 1-dimensional growth. This transition has not been apparent previously for slow events because data have sampled only the bounded regime and may be obscured for earthquakes when observations from multiple tectonic regions are combined. We have attempted to sample the expected transition between bounded and unbounded regimes for the slow slip population, measuring tremor cluster parameters from catalogs for Japan and Cascadia and using them as proxies for small slow slip event characteristics. For fast events we employed published earthquake slip models. Observations corroborate our hypothesis, but highlight observational difficulties. We find that M0-T observations for both slow and fast slip events, spanning 12 orders of magnitude in M0, are consistent with a single model based on dislocation theory. Remarkably, a few parameters can explain the first-order features of these observations: the average slip zone width or boundaries, slip front propagation velocities, and stress drop. While a continuous distribution of slip modes likely exists, this distribution may be bimodal.",

During that period of the Earth's history, atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have dropped, and global climate both cooled and evolved towards high amplitude oscillating conditions that are associated with the waxing and waning of continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.

In this century, humanity will explore these worlds, searching for life beyond Earth and seeking thereby to understand the limits of habitability.\nOf our ocean worlds, Enceladus presents a unique combination of attributes: large reservoir of subsurface water already known to contain salts, organics, and silica nanoparticles originating from hydrothermal activity; and able to be sampled via a plume predictably expressed into space. These special circumstances immediately tag Enceladus as a key destination for potential missions to search for evidence of non-Earth life, and lead to a range of potential mission concepts: for orbital reconnaissance; in situ and returned-sample analysis of plume and surface-fallback material; and direct sulcus, vent, cavern, and ocean exploration.\nEach mission type can address a unique set of science questions, and would require a unique set of capabilities, most of which are not yet developed. Both the questions and the capability developments can be sequenced into a programmatic precedence network, the realization of which requires international cooperation. Three factors make this true: exploring remote oceans autonomously will cost a lot; the Outer Space Treaty governs planetary protection; and discovery of non-Earth life is an epochal human imperative.\nResults of current planning will be presented in AGU session 8599: how ocean-world science questions and capability requirements can be parsed into programmatically acceptable mission increments; how one mission proposed into the Discovery program in 2015 would take the next step on this path; the Decadal calendar of decision points and program options that will constrain ocean-world exploration through mid-century; and findings of the COSPAR Planetary Protection Panel colloquium for ocean-world exploration held in September 2015.",

            "abstract": "Summertime marine boundary layer stratocumulus (Sc) clouds have a strong impact on ecology and infrastructure over the coast of California. Modeling the lifetime of such clouds in global climate models (GCM) or numerical weather prediction models (NWP) is difficult and significant errors are typically observed. For instance, stratocumulus clouds over the coast of southern California in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were found to dissipate, on average, 1.9 hours earlier than observed via satellite. In order to determine the factors controlling the Sc lifetime, we have employed large eddy simulations (LES) and a mixed layer model (MLM). Enhancements to previous MLMs include a temperature dependent radiation scheme, a land surface model, and a novel entrainment parameterization scheme for stratocumulus clouds over land in which the entrainment velocity is derived as a function of the surface buoyancy flux and the buoyancy flux integrated over the cloud layer. The advantage of using the MLM is that different mechanisms and feedbacks controlling stratocumulus cloud thickness can be examined rapidly through sensitivity studies.\nWe find that during the night cloud lifetime is modulated by longwave cooling of the boundary layer and entrainment flux warming and drying. During the day, surface shortwave radiative heating drives surface flux therefore increasing the turbulence within the boundary layer and increasing entrainment flux. For wet surface conditions, the increase in latent heat flux moistens the boundary layer and offsets the increase in entrainment flux warming and drying of the boundary layer and clouds persist throughout the day. For dry surface conditions, the combination of increased surface sensible heat flux warming the boundary layer and increased entrainment flux act to dissipate the cloud within a couple of hours after sunrise. For both cases, the sea breeze advects cool ocean air that acts to thicken and prolong the cloud lifetime. Next, we utilize the MLM, validated through the LES, to study the sensitivity of the Sc cloud lifetime to a comprehensive set of parameters such as initial cloud thickness and inversion strength.",

            "abstract": "A fuel-based approach is presented for estimating emissions from US oil and natural gas production that utilizes state-level fuel surveys of oil and gas engine activity, well-level production data, and emission factors for oil and gas equipment. Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are mapped on a 4 km x 4 km horizontal grid for 2013-14 in Utah and Colorado. Emission sources include combustion from exploration (e.g., drilling), production (e.g., heaters, dehydrators, and compressor engines), and natural gas processing plants, which comprise a large fraction of the local combustion activity in oil and gas basins. Fuel-based emission factors of NOx are from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and applied to spatially-resolved maps of CO2 emissions. Preliminary NOx emissions from this study are estimated for the Uintah Basin, Utah, to be ~5300 metric tons of NO2-equivalent in 2013. Our result compares well with an observations-based top-down emissions estimate of NOx derived from a previous study, ~4200 metric tons of NO2-equivalent. By contrast, the 2011 National Emissions Inventory estimates oil and gas emissions of NOx to be ~3 times higher than our study in the Uintah Basin. We intend to expand our fuel-based approach to map combustion-related emissions in other U.S. oil and natural gas basins and compare with additional observational datasets.",

            "abstract": "There is ongoing debate regarding the mobility of crystal mush zones in granitic magmas and their ability to mix and interact with intrusive batches to form compositional heterogeneity in plutons. Magmatic structures, localized zones of compositional diversity, enable evaluation of the significance of magmatic flow and convection vs. chemical diffusion in magmatic systems by determining their mode of formation. With further study, magmatic structures are potentially powerful tools recording syn-emplacement tectonic activity. Pothole Dome, in the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite of the Tuolumne Intrusive Complex is an ideal location to investigate magmatic structures since a variety of plumes, pipes, mafic ellipsoids, and schlieren troughs are densely clustered. Previous workers have established patterns in the orientations of different Pothole Dome magmatic structures that are indicative of a broad pattern of movement and younging directions at the kilometer scale. Preliminary whole-rock geochemical and isotopic data compare variations between the normal Cathedral magmas and a plume, trough, tube, potassium feldspar cluster and granitic dyke to investigate plausible mechanisms for the formation of the distinct compositional diversity formed in the structures.\nSchlieren, abundant in biotite, hornblende, apatite, sphene and zircon show relatively high levels of titanium, calcium and magnesium relative to the feldspar cluster and dyke. Schlieren are also enriched in minor elements including Zr, Y, Sr and Ce relative to the felsic structures. Both elemental and isotopic data for schlieren defining the plumes and troughs and the late leucogranitic dikes and k-feldspar clusters all plot outside the typical mixing line for Cathedral Peak Granodiorite compositions. We postulate that this may be a result of an unmixing process during physical flow of previously mixed populations of chemically distinct crystals in the Cathedral Peak.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution 2D seismic data acquired by the USGS in 2013 enable detailed characterization of the gas and gas hydrate system at lease block Green Canyon 955 (GC955) in the Gulf of Mexico, USA. Earlier studies, based on conventional industry 3D seismic data and logging-while-drilling (LWD) borehole data acquired in 2009, identified general aspects of the regional and local depositional setting along with two gas hydrate-bearing sand reservoirs and one layer containing fracture-filling gas hydrate within fine-grained sediments. These studies also highlighted a number of critical remaining questions. The 2013 high-resolution 2D data fill a significant gap in our previous understanding of the site by enabling interpretation of the complex system of faults and gas chimneys that provide conduits for gas flow and thus control the gas hydrate distribution observed in the LWD data. In addition, we have improved our understanding of the main channel/levee sand reservoir body, mapping in fine detail the levee sequences and the fault system that segments them into individual reservoirs. The 2013 data provide a rarely available high-resolution view of a levee reservoir package, with sequential levee deposits clearly imaged. Further, we can calculate the total gas hydrate resource present in the main reservoir body, refining earlier estimates. Based on the 2013 seismic data and assumptions derived from the LWD data, we estimate an in-place volume of 840 million cubic meters or 29 billion cubic feet of gas in the form of gas hydrate. Together, these interpretations provide a significantly improved understanding of the gas hydrate reservoirs and the gas migration system at GC955.",

Our ultimate goal is to quantitatively validate models of the global coronal magnetic field by comparing forward models of synthetic data to real observations. As a necessary first step, we seek to build a three-dimensional (3D) model of the electron density in the solar corona, based on white-light coronagraph data. Given that these observations are two-dimensional snapshots, we employ a new application of statistical tomography to piece together the full 3D picture. In an initial step, we demonstrate that our method is capable of reconstructing geometrically-simple density formations. We next turn to more realistic coronal density structures as represented by the global magnetohydrodynamic models made available by Predictive Science Inc., and integrated to create synthetic data using the FORWARD SolarSoft codes. Finally, we consider the application of our method to Mauna Loa Solar Observatory K-Coronagraph observations, and discuss the strengths and limitations of our method.",

            "abstract": "Statistics of models of geophysical fluids may be directly accessed by solving the equations of motion for the statistics themselves as proposed by Lorenz 50 years ago. Such Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) is applied to idealized barotropic jets that are driven stochastically. Low-order zonally-averaged statistics are captured by expansions in equal-time cumulants. In the limit of large time-scale separation between the zonal modes and the eddies, the dynamics are quasi-linear, emergent zonal jets are driven directly by the Reynolds stresses exerted by the eddies, and the equations of motion for the cumulants close at second order. We demonstrate that higher-order statistics may also be obtained in this limit through the use of large deviation theory to calculate the rate function of the zonally-averaged Reynolds stress. For moderate separation in time-scales, eddy-eddy interactions must be retained, and cumulant expansions truncated at third order are able to accurately reproduce zonal means and two-point correlations. An alternative closure based upon scale separation is also illustrated.",

            "abstract": "The 24 August 2014 M6.0 South Napa Earthquake produced a complex surface rupture involving multiple fault traces, which were imaged and mapped in detail during the weeks following the earthquake. We excavated eight trenches across two of the fault strands near the northern termination of mapped surface faulting where the faults traverse fluvial terraces above Redwood Creek. At this location, Fault trace A (the principal rupture trace) and Fault trace C (the largest of the secondary ruptures) are approximately 100 meters apart. Fault slip in 2014 was minor at this location on both traces; linear regression of fence post locations modeled from terrestrial LiDAR scans of the northern property-boundary fence indicates about 5 cm of horizontal displacement on Fault A and 3 cm on Fault C. We excavated eight trenches across the two fault strands. Trenches 1 through 6, excavated on the lower, younger terraces, exposed no faulting in the underlying fluvial deposits. Trenches 7 and 8, sited on the higher, older terrace, exposed shear zones that juxtapose bedrock against Pleistocene fluvial gravel. On this older terrace, faulting extends into the youngest deposits underlying the Pleistocene terrace surface. We collected samples of organic materials for radiocarbon dating in trenches 1 through 6, and samples for luminescence dating from trench 8 to constrain the ages of the deposits. Initial radiocarbon ages of samples collected from unfaulted deposits suggest there has been no significant surface rupture on either fault in more than approximately 6000 years. Additional radiocarbon and luminescence ages will further constrain the timing of faulting. These preliminary results suggest that no large surface rupture has occurred on these faults in the late Holocene at this location, and that the 2014 surface rupture will not be preserved in the stratigraphic record at this site.",

            "abstract": "The transition from rifting of oceanic lithosphere to full magmatic spreading is examined at the Galapagos triple junction (GTJ) where the tip of the Cocos-Nazca spreading center (called C-N Rift) is propagating westward and breaking apart 0.5 Ma lithosphere formed at the East Pacific Rise near 2 15’N. Bathymetric mapping of the western section of the C-N Rift is limited, but sufficient to obtain a first-order understanding of how seafloor spreading is established. An initial rifting stage is followed by rifting with magma supply and lastly, full magmatic spreading is established. The flexural rotation of normal faults that border the rift basins is used to document thinning of the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere before magmatic spreading begins. The earliest faults show small outward rotation (1-5 degrees) for their offset suggesting that they cut thick lithosphere. Subsequent faults closer to the axis have larger outward rotations (up to 35-40 degrees) with larger offset indicating that the lithosphere was much thinner at the time of faulting and that low-angle detachment faults are forming. It is during late stage rifting and prior to full magmatic spreading that detachment faults such as the Intrarift ridge along Hess Deep rift are observed. Studies of low-angle detachment faulting during continental breakup at the Woodlark Basin suggest that their formation signals the input of magma beneath the rift. If this also is the case at the C-N Rift then magma is being supplied beneath Hess Deep rift. The axis of the segment immediately east of Hess Deep rift is characterized by a shallow graben with small seamounts scattered along it, typical of segments farther to the east, and we infer that full magmatic seafloor spreading has been established here. Our results provide new information on the formation of divergent boundaries in oceanic lithosphere, and place constraints on the supply of magma to a newly developing plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "Summertime aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in the Southeast U.S. is high and sharply enhanced (2-3 times) compared to wintertime AOT. This seasonal pattern is unique to the Southeast U.S. and is of particular interest because temperatures there have not warmed over the past 100 years, contrasting with trends in other U.S. regions. Some investigators hypothesize the Southeast temperature trend is due to secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formed from interactions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and anthropogenic emissions that create a cooling haze. However, aerosol measurements made at the surface do not exhibit strong seasonal differences in mass or organic fraction to support this hypothesis. In this work, we attempt to reconcile the spatial and temporal distribution of AOT over the U.S. with surface mass measurements by examining trends in particle-phase liquid water, an aerosol constituent that effectively scatters radiation and is removed from aerosols in mass measurements at routine surface monitoring sites. We employ the thermodynamic model ISORROPIA (v2.1) to estimate surface and aloft aerosol water mass concentrations at locations of Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) sites using measured speciated ion mass concentrations and NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) meteorological data. Results demonstrate strong seasonal differences in aerosol water in the eastern compared to the western part of the U.S., consistent with geographic patterns in AOT. The highest mean regional seasonal difference from 2000 to 2007 is 5.5 µg m-3 and occurs the Southeast, while the lowest is 0.44 µg m-3 and occurs in the dry Mountain West. Our findings suggest 1) similarity between spatial trends in aerosol water in the U.S. and previously published AOT data from the MODIS-TERRA instrument and 2) similar interannual trends in mean aerosol water and previously published interannual AOT trends from MISR, MODIS-TERRA, MODIS-AQUA, and the Walker Branch AERONET site. These aerosol water results provide a plausible explanation for the geographical and seasonal patterns in AOT, and reconcile AOT with surface mass networks.",

            "abstract": "<span'';\">The parameters shear wave velocity and soft sediment thickness are very important for the site investigation. Shear wave velocities are usually obtained from the dispersion curve analysis of surface wave (MASW), which are obtained by active or passive seismic array. Dispersion curve provides a reliable velocity estimate at frequencies above the fundamental resonant frequency of the site (Hobiger et al, 2009), however dispersion curve analysis does not provide information about the deeper layers,. The information of deeper layer can be included from H/V spectral ratio analysis, which provides a very good estimate of fundamental frequency of site. A joint inversion analysis of dispersion and H/V curves have been made, the dispersion curve has been obtained by active source (MASW) while H/V ratios are obtained from seismic ambient noise recording through single 3 component broadband seismometer. H/V curve inversion are linked with Rayleigh wave ellipticty curve, however Bonnefoy-Claudet (2008) have shown that both Rayleigh and Love waves contribute to the H/V spectrum, so it is necessary to accurately extract Rayleigh wave ellipticity from single station recording. We have utilized two techniques to retrieve Rayliegh wave ellipticty from our noise recording. One is random decrement technique, RayDec (Hobiger et al, 2009) and second, time frequency analysis (Neries project, 2010). This Rayleigh wave ellipticty from H/V recording and dispersion curve from MASW have been jointly inverted. The inversion has been carried out using neighborhood algorithm introduced to geophysics by Sambridge (1999). Shear wave velocity profile have been compared with borehole result (at same location), which showed a very promising correlation, especially within zone of high velocity contrast and depth of bedrock.\n",

            "abstract": "On 22 April 2015, Calbuco Volcano in southern Chile erupted for the first time in 43 years. The two primary phases of eruption, separated by a few hours, produced pyroclastic density currents, lahars, and spectacular vertical eruption columns that rose into the stratosphere. Clear weather conditions allowed the populated areas of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas full view of the lightning-rich eruption, which was rapidly shared through social media. A wealth of remote-sensing data was also publically available in near real-time. We used this information to assess the eruption behavior by combining satellite-based umbrella growth rates, and the location and frequency of volcanic lightning. Umbrella expansion rates from GOES-13 satellite retrievals correspond to eruption rates of about 4x106 kg s-1 for the first eruptive phase and 6x106 kg s-1 for the second phase, following the approach of Pouget et al. (2013, JVGR, 258, 100-112). The location and timing of lightning flashes were obtained from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) Global Volcanic Lightning Monitor, which is updated approximately every minute (Ewert et al., 2010, Fall AGU Abstract AE31A-04). Interestingly, the onset of detected flashes was delayed by ~30 min after the start of each eruptive phase. Lighting provided a useful proxy for the waxing or waning intensity of the eruption, and helped identify the end of significant ash emissions. Using the 1-D volcanic plume model Plumeria, we have also simulated the vertical distribution of ash and ice in the plumes to examine potential causes of the extraordinary amount of volcanic lightning (1,094 flashes detected). Our analysis provides information on eruption timing, duration, and mass flow rate, which are necessary for ash dispersal modeling within hours of eruption. Results are also consistent with the field-based measurements of total erupted volume. We suggest that the combination of satellite-detected umbrella expansion rates with lightning data may provide a useful approach to constrain near real-time inputs for ash dispersal models and hazard warnings.",

The influence of the tectonic environment on the dynamic change rule and the enrichment regulation of karst system is significant for the exploitation and protection of karst groundwater resources.\nFrom the control function of fault and fracture point of view, based on the developmental and distribution pattern of multi-episodic tectonism, this study analyzed fractures in the three-fold structural units characterized by NE-NW and NS trends and discussed the influence of multi-episodic tectonism on the groundwater flow system and rich water zones.\nThe results showed that the geological fracture underwent two episodes of tectonism, thrusting nappe in the Jurassic and extension in the Cretaceous. The overprint of two episodes resulted in a number of faults with high hydraulic conductivity, which serve as conduits. The superiority joints groups are in the NE and NW directions, with conjugated characteristics. The high-angle or vertical dips directly benefit infiltration. The fractures in the intersection areas have formed groundwater runoff channels and strong space, controlling water-rich zones such as Baidai, Ganchi-Changgou and Gaozhuang-Shiwo. Magmatic rock and the aquiclude also contribute to the rich water zones and the location of springs, all of which have important significance for water supply.\nKeywords: system of Karst groundwater, geological structure, fracture network, hydrogeological flow field, Zhangfang karst area",

            "abstract": "Pass-through superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) is one of the most important tools for modern paleomagnetism research. It offers rapid and continuous measurements of weak remanent magnetization preserved in various geological archives. However, pass-through SRM measurements are inevitably smoothed and even distorted due to the convolution effect of the SRM sensor response, and deconvolution is necessary to restore high-resolution signal from pass-through measurements. Reliable deconvolution relies on accurate estimate of the SRM sensor response and our understanding of errors associated with sample measurements. In this presentation, we introduce new practical tool and procedure to facilitate rapid and accurate measurements of SRM sensor response with demonstration using an SRM at the Kochi Core Center, Japan. We also report accurate measurements of SRM tray positions measured using laser interferometry. The measured positions with an actual u-channel sample on the tray show vibrations with peak amplitudes of ~50μm following each stop of the tray. The vibrations diminish towards background level in ~0.4 sec. Comparison with the positions expected from the stepping motor counts show random discrepancies with standard deviations of 0.1~0.2 mm. Measurements with u-channel show higher standard deviations including significant stepwise changes of up to ~0.5mm.",

            "abstract": "Soil cracks can act as preferential flowpaths, but their effects on non-equilibrium flow and transport are difficult to quantify because of dynamic interactions between water and the crack structure. I have developed a simple method that combines infiltration measurements with digital imaging to simultaneously quantify infiltration and crack closure. Preliminary data collected on soils with moderate shrink-swell potential (possessing surface-connected cracks of 1-5 mm width) reveal that soil cracks begin to close almost immediately after the onset of infiltration, but soon thereafter attain quasi-stable geometries. This suggests that in the context of short-term infiltration tests it may be possible to model soil cracks as having relatively constant contributions to preferential flow.",

            "abstract": "The August 2015 GeoGirls program was a project designed to inspire girls to gain an appreciation and enthusiasm for Earth sciences using Mount St. Helens as an outdoor volcanic laboratory. Occupations in the field of science and engineering tend to be held by more males than females. One way to address this is to introduce girls to possible opportunities within the geosciences and encourage them to learn more about the dynamic environment in which they live. In 2015, the GeoGirls program sought to accomplish this goal through organizing a five day-long field camp for twenty middle school-aged girls, along with four high school-aged mentors and two local teachers. This group explored Mount St. Helens guided by female scientists from the USGS Cascade Volcano Observatory (CVO), the Mount St. Helens Institute (MSHI), UNAVCO, Boise State, Georgia Tech, University of Washington and Oregon State University. To introduce participants to techniques used by volcanologists, the girls participated in hands-on experiments and research projects focusing on seismology, GPS, terrestrial lidar, photogrammetry, water and tephra. Participants also learned to collect samples, analyze data and use microscopes. Through this experience, participants acquired strategies for conducting research by developing hypotheses, making observations, thinking critically and sharing their findings with others. The success of the GeoGirls program was evaluated by participant and parent survey questionnaires, which allowed assessment of overall enthusiasm and interest in pursuing careers in the geosciences. The program was free to participants and was run jointly by MSHI and CVO and funded by NSF, the American Association of University Women, the Association for Women Geoscientists, the Association of Environmental & Engineering Geologists and private donors. The program will run again in the summer of 2016.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that, when a stably stratified flow with approach velocity U and buoyancy frequency N flows over an obstacle of height h, the low–level flow goes around the object while the rest flows over it for low F = U / N h. The streamline that separates the two types of flow is the dividing streamline, and the prediction of its height Hs is of great practical interest.\nSheppard (1956) provided the analytical solution Hs = h (1 – F) and, because of its practical utility, the formula continues to be largely employed, notwithstanding the criticism it has attracted because of certain underlying assumptions, viz., 1) the crude approximation of constant N and uniform approach velocity U, which is unrealistic for atmospheric flows; 2) the incorrect assumption of a complete balance between kinetic and potential energy at the mountain summit, which neglects the energy contributions of the perturbation pressure field as well as viscous dissipation adjacent to the hill surface. In this study, the first limitation is addressed by considering a logarithmic approach velocity profile but with constant N. A modified logarithmic velocity profile for stably stratified flows is proposed, and an analytical solution is obtained for Hs in terms of Lambert-W functions. Results are tested against smoke visualization experiments and related field measurements made during the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations (MATERHORN) Program. Some of the assumptions and perceived violations of them are tested using laboratory experiments conducted in a stratified water channel.",

            "abstract": "One of the data products that will be provided by the TEMPO satellite mission is 0-2 km ozone column concentration. To make inferences about surface air quality from this data product, the relationship between lower-tropospheric column and surface ozone concentrations and their diurnal, seasonal, and spatial variations have to be well understood. To characterize these relationships, we have used ozone profile observations obtained with NOAA’s truck-based, scanning TOPAZ ozone lidar from several recent field campaigns including Discover-AQ Houston and Colorado, the Uintah Basin Wintertime Ozone Study (UBWOS), and the Las Vegas Ozone Study (LVOS). The TOPAZ lidar is ideally suited for this kind of study because it provides ozone profiles from about 15 m above ground level (AGL) up to 3 km AGL at high spatial and temporal resolution. We have used the lidar observations closest to the ground as a proxy for surface ozone and compared them to the 0-2 km AGL average column ozone concentrations measured with the lidar. Results from the Discover-AQ Colorado campaign show that in the afternoon, when the boundary layer (BL) was deep and well mixed, ozone column and surface concentrations agreed quite well. However, during the morning hours, ozone column concentrations were significantly higher than those at the surface, because ozone was depleted in a shallow surface layer due to titration and deposition, whereas ozone levels in the residual layer aloft remained moderately high. The analysis of column and surface ozone correlations using ozone lidar observations from the Discover-AQ Houston, UBWOS and LVOS campaigns is currently underway. The results from these studies will provide additional insights into the relationship between column and surface ozone, in particular their variation as a function of measurement location and season, and their dependence on BL processes such as mixed layer height evolution, land-sea breeze circulation, and terrain-induced flows.",

            "abstract": "The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has been monitoring boundary layer ozone at the Walnut Grove Tower (WGT) since 1996 for investigating regional transport and vertical profile. Walnut Grove is located between Sacramento and Stockton, CA in the Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta. Sampling inlets are positioned at 30-ft, 400-ft, 800-ft, 1200-ft and 1600-ft levels of the 2000-ft tower, which is one of the tallest monitoring towers in the Western US. Ozone, ambient temperature, wind speed, and wind direction are simultaneously measured at each level, and reported as hourly averages. The current study included analyses of available ozone and corresponding meteorological data for the months of June – September from 1996 – 2014 with objectives to: 1) explore trends and inter-annual variability of ozone, 2) examine any correlations between ozone and meteorological parameters, 3) understand interactions of ozone measured at various levels, and 4) assess how well a regulatory state-of-the-science air quality model such as the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) captures observation. Daily 1-hr maximum ozone has been consistently decreasing during the 1996 – 2014 period at a rate of ~1 ppb per year. This indicates that CARB’s measures to control ambient ozone have been effective over the past years. Evolution of the vertical profile throughout the day shows that ozone is fairly homogeneously mixed between 1 – 5 pm, when mixing height typically reaches the maximum. Ozone at 30-ft shows the greatest variability because of its proximity to the ground and emissions sources - rises faster during morning hours (7 – 10 am) and declines more rapidly during evening hours (7 – 10 pm) compared to other levels. Air masses reaching the tower are predominantly southwesterly (247 – 257 deg.) at the bottom, and southwesterly to slightly northwesterly (254 – 302 deg.) at top levels. Daily 1-hr maximum ozone was negatively correlated with wind speed (i.e. ozone was high under low wind condition) and positively correlated with ambient temperature (i.e. ozone was high under high temperature condition) during ~40% and ~50% of the time, respectively. A modeling exercise for Jun – Sep of 2012 shows that CMAQ captures the observed evolution and vertical mixing of ozone throughout the day quite well in the boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "In the present day, it has become more apparent that redox reactions involving mineral dust are of great interest, especially for Fe-containing mineral dust, as they transported and deposited into certain regions of the ocean that dissolved iron is often a limiting nutrient for ocean life. Given that heterogeneous reactions of Fe-containing mineral dust with acidic gases and their precursors, i.e. HNO3, dimethyl sulfide( DMS), lead to lower pH environments, the amount of bioavailable iron can increase as they are transported through the atmosphere. The current work focuses on chemical and photochemical processing of Fe-containing mineral dust particles in the presence of HNO3, SO2 and DMS under atmospherically relevant conditions. Here, various spectroscopic methods are combined with dissolution measurements to investigate atmospheric processing of iron containing aerosol dust, with a specific focus on mineralogy and environmental conditions, i.e. pH, relative humidity, temperature and solar flux. Ilmenite (FeTiO3) is used as one of the proxies for Fe-containing minerals that have enough complexity to mimic the mineral dust, yet simple enough to know the details of the reaction pathways. During these studies, above factors are found to play significant roles in the dissolution of iron from mineral dust aerosol. More importantly, data suggest that presence of titanium in the lattice structure of ilmenite enhances iron dissolution, at least by 3-fold in a comparison with hematite. Further, growth and activity of ocean diatoms (Cyclotella meneghiniana) are monitored in the presence of Fe-containing mineral dust under the same conditions. Here, diatoms are added to the reactors containing pre-dissolved iron from a prior 48hr reaction. Results show a high correlation between the growth of diatoms and the amount of bioavailable from iron containing minerals. The current study thus highlights these important, yet unconsidered, factors in the atmospheric processing of iron-containing mineral dust aerosol.",

            "abstract": "Local capillary trapping is the small-scale (10-2 to 10+1 m) CO2 trapping that is caused by the capillary pressure heterogeneity. The benefit of LCT, applied specially to CO2 sequestration, is that saturation of stored CO2 is larger than the residual gas, yet these CO2 are not susceptible to leakage through failed seals. Thus quantifying the extent of local capillary trapping is valuable in design and risk assessment of geologic storage projects.\nModeling local capillary trapping is computationally expensive and may even be intractable using a conventional reservoir simulator. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model local capillary trapping by combining geologic criteria and connectivity analysis. The connectivity analysis originally developed for characterizing well-to-reservoir connectivity is adapted to this problem by means of a newly defined edge weight property between neighboring grid blocks, which accounts for the multiphase flow properties, injection rate, and gravity effect. Then the connectivity is estimated from shortest path algorithm to predict the CO2 migration behavior and plume shape during injection. A geologic criteria algorithm is developed to estimate the potential local capillary traps based only on the entry capillary pressure field. The latter is correlated to a geostatistical realization of permeability field.\nThe extended connectivity analysis shows a good match of CO2 plume computed by the full-physics simulation. We then incorporate it into the geologic algorithm to quantify the amount of LCT structures identified within the entry capillary pressure field that can be filled during CO2 injection. Several simulations are conducted in the reservoirs with different level of heterogeneity (measured by the Dykstra-Parsons coefficient) under various injection scenarios. We find that there exists a threshold Dykstra-Parsons coefficient, below which low injection rate gives rise to more LCT; whereas higher injection rate increases LCT in heterogeneous reservoirs.\nBoth the geologic algorithm and connectivity analysis are very fast; therefore, the integrated methodology can be used as a quick tool to estimate local capillary trapping. It can also be used as a potential complement to the full-physics simulation to evaluate safe storage capacity.",

            "abstract": "The SuperCam remote-sensing instrument suite in development for the Mars 2020 rover represents a significant advance from its precursor, ChemCam, by adding Raman spectroscopy (to 12 m distance) and visible and near-infrared (VISIR) reflectance spectroscopy. For Raman spectroscopy the LIBS Nd:YAG laser is frequency-doubled to 532 nm (green Raman). A transmission spectrometer with an intensified CCD covers 150-4400 cm-1 spectral range at a resolution of 10 cm-1. The system is adjustably time-gated, removing much of the mineral fluorescence from the Raman spectra and also facilitating time-resolved fluorescence studies. The infrared range covers 1.3-2.6 microns in addition to the existing 400-840 nm range on ChemCam. Additional upgrades include doubling the LIBS resolution in the 535-860 nm range and adding color to the Remote Micro-Imager (RMI), which is the highest resolution remote imager on the rover. A large-scale effort is being applied to the on-board standards, being led by U. Valladolid in Spain, with targets contributed by many institutions. The number of geological targets will be increased from 8 (on ChemCam) to 22, planned to include end-member plagioclase feldspars, hi- and low-Ca pyroxene, olivines, several fine-grained basalts, hematite, jarosite, carbonates, apatite, and several synthetic targets doped with trace elements. Three Spectralon targets are planned for IR calibration and several color bands for the RMI. All but the Spectralon and color bands should be available for LIBS calibration, and many are also being designed for Raman and VISIR calibration. For LIBS this collection of standards will significantly improve the accuracy relative to ChemCam; other precision improvements are anticipated to come from correcting for variable plasma temperature. The presentation will illustrate how Mars datasets will be significantly improved via this multi-technique approach and will give a first look at prototype SuperCam spectra.",

Current gravity analyses cannot rule out a wide range of values (k2=43–0.50) and a variety of plausible interior models. We are seeking an independent estimate of tidal Love number k2 with improved errors to further constrain these models.\nExisting gravity-based solutions for Mercury's spin axis orientation differ from those of Earth-based radar and topography-based solutions. This difference may indicate an error in one of the determinations, or a real difference between the orientations about which the gravity field and the crust rotate, which can exist in a variety of plausible configuration. Securing an independent estimate of the spin axis orientation is vital because this quantity has a profound impact on the determination of the moment of inertia and interior models.\nWe have derived a spherical harmonic solution of the gravity field to degree and order 40 as well as estimates of the tidal Love number k2 and spin axis orientation.",

            "abstract": "A paradox of the deformation pattern in the NE Japan Arc is that the short-term (<102 years) deformation observed by geodetic techniques and the long-term (>104 years) deformation estimated from geomorphic and geologic evidence are different in both rate and/or direction. It has been proposed that elastic deformation released by a megathrust earthquake along the Japanese Trench, could resolve this paradox. However, co-seismic and post-seismic deformation associated with the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw9.0) has not compensated for the misfit. To understand the physical properties of the crust and mechanism of strain accumulation and release in the NE Japan Arc, more careful and detailed comparisons of deformation using various timescales and methods may provide a fundamental clue. For estimating long-term vertical deformation rates of NE Japan Arc, we performed 1) a compilation of previous low-temperature thermochronometric data in the Japanese Islands and 2) apatite and zircon (U–Th)/He (AHe and ZHe) thermochronometric analyses on the late Cretaceous and Paleogene granitoids across the NE Japan Arc. Both the previous fission-track (FT) and newly obtained AHe ages indicate an obvious contrast in cooling/denudation histories between the fore-arc and back-arc sides of the NE Japan Arc. FT ages of 100–46 Ma and AHe ages of 59–50 Ma in the Abukuma Mountains in the fore-arc side indicate relatively slow cooling/denudation and a stable tectonic setting during the Cenozoic. On the other hand, younger apatite FT ages of 6.1 and 4.6 Ma and AHe ages of 11–1.5 Ma in the Ou Backbone range, Iide-Asahi Mountains, and Echigo Mountains in the back-arc side may reflect rapid cooling/denudation since the latest Miocene or late Pliocene. ZHe ages in the back-arc side range between 54–11 Ma, which is generally consistent with their coexisting AHe ages considering the difference in their closure temperatures.",

            "abstract": "A major debate related to the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau is centered on whether or not an island arc-back-arc basin system occurred along the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, central Tibet. Here we present new zircon U-Pb geochronology, rare earth elements (REE) and bulk-rock geochemistry of these magmatic rocks in the Amdo area, the middle Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, central Tibet, to identify significant and new records of Mesozoic tectonomagmatic processes. Zircon U-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS techniques yields a concordant age with a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 228.6 ± 1.6 Ma (n = 7, MSWD = 1.19) for the Quehala basalts, and a mean ages of 220.0 ± 2.1 (n = 8, MSWD = 1.5) for the Amdo pillow lavas. On the normalized REE patterns of zircon, significant Ce enrichment indicates the magma sources of these magmatic rocks have been subjected to modification of slab-derived fluid. Geochemical features suggest that the Quehala basalts (ca. 228 Ma), displaying an island arc tholeiites (IAT) affinity, resulted from partial melting of an enriched mantle wedge in the subduction zone, whereas the Amdo pillow lavas (ca. 220 Ma) characterized by both arc-like and N-MORB-like geochemical characteristics occurred as associated back-arc basin basalts (BABB) at the spreading center of back-arc basin after the formation of island arc tholeiites. In conclusion, the volcanic rocks in the Amdo area have documented the magmatic processes from early-stage subduction to development of associated back-arc basin, confirming the occurrence of intra-oceanic subduction within the Bangong-Nujiang Tethys during the late Triassic. Furthermore, the spatial relationships among the Quehala formation, Tumengela formation and Amdo pillow lavas indicate northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean during the Late Triassic to middle Jurassic.",

            "abstract": "The ability to detect and monitor precursory events, thermal signatures, and ongoing volcanic activity in near-realtime is an invaluable tool. Volcanic hazards often range from low level lava effusion to large explosive eruptions, easily capable of ejecting ash to aircraft cruise altitudes. Using ground based remote sensing to detect and monitor this activity is essential, but the required equipment is often expensive and difficult to maintain, which increases the risk to public safety and the likelihood of financial impact. Our investigation explores the use of 'off the shelf' cameras, ranging from computer webcams to low-light security cameras, to monitor volcanic incandescent activity in near-realtime. These cameras are ideal as they operate in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, are relatively cheap to purchase, consume little power, are easily replaced, and can provide telemetered, near-realtime data. We focus on the early detection of volcanic activity, using automated scripts that capture streaming online webcam imagery and evaluate each image according to pixel brightness, in order to automatically detect and identify increases in potentially hazardous activity. The cameras used here range in price from $0 to $1,000 and the script is written in Python, an open source programming language, to reduce the overall cost to potential users and increase the accessibility of these tools, particularly in developing nations. In addition, by performing laboratory tests to determine the spectral response of these cameras, a direct comparison of collocated low-light and thermal infrared cameras has allowed approximate eruption temperatures to be correlated to pixel brightness. Data collected from several volcanoes; (1) Stromboli, Italy (2) Shiveluch, Russia (3) Fuego, Guatemala (4) Popcatépetl, México, along with campaign data from Stromboli (June, 2013), and laboratory tests are presented here.",

            "abstract": "Eastward and northward propagation of intraseasonal signals is a prominent feature during boreal winter over the tropical Northern Hemisphere. Here, an obvious southward propagation is revealed over the South China Sea (SCS) in sea surface temperature (SST), surface wind, and latent heat flux anomalies. The SST in the SCS displays prominent intraseasonal variations during boreal winter with a spectrum peak in the 10-30-day time period. These intraseasonal SST variations are closely associated with intraseasonal variations of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). A weak EAWM is preceded by cooler SST and followed by warmer SST in the SCS and subtropical western North Pacific. The SST and surface wind anomalies display a coherent southward propagation over the SCS during boreal winter. This southward propagation is attributed to the wind-evaporation-SST effect under climatological northerly winds in winter, which differs from summer when climatological winds are westerly. SST-induced wind speed anomalies are larger to the north side of SST anomalies. This induces larger surface evaporation anomalies to the north side, leading to a southward displacement of large SST anomalies. In turn, wind and evaporation anomalies move southward. There appears to be a positive feedback between circulation and precipitation that leads to amplification of meridional wind anomalies when the SST anomalies are weak. Surface latent heat flux is a dominant factor for the SST change in the SCS and the Yellow Sea. Shortwave radiation has a complementary contribution in the SCS, but has a negative effect in the Yellow Sea. The wind-induced Ekman advection appears important for the SST warming in the Yellow Sea.",

            "abstract": "Arched magnetoplasma structures ubiquitously exist in the solar atmosphere and affect energetic phenomena such as flares and coronal mass ejections. In a laboratory setup, excitation of fast-waves (with characteristics of EUV/EIT waves on the Sun) and global kink-mode oscillations from an erupting arched magnetoplasma was recorded with an unprecedented detail by capturing spatio-temporal evolution of the three-dimensional magnetic-field and plasma density. Images of the arched magnetoplasma evolution were recorded using a fast-CCD camera. The global kink-mode oscillations were observed as transverse oscillations across the symmetry plane of the magnetoplasma. The arched magnetoplasma (plasma β ≈ 10-3, Lundquist number ≈ 102–105, radius/ion-gyroradius ≈ 20, B ≈ 1000 Gauss at footpoints) was created using a lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) plasma source and it evolved in an ambient magnetoplasma produced by another LaB6 source (See Ref. [2] for details). The experiment runs continuously with a 0.5 Hz repetition rate. Hence, plasma parameters were recorded with a good resolution (spatial-resolution/magnetoplasma-length ≈ 10-2 – 10-3, temporal-resolution/eruption-time ≈ 10-3) using movable probes in three-dimensions. Mimicking the behavior of solar eruptions, a long pre-eruption phase (lasting up to 150 Alfvén transit times) was created in the laboratory by gradually increasing the electrical current. This leads to an impulsive eruption of the arched magnetoplasma within 4 Alfvén transit times. The relative magnitudes of the parameters of the arched and ambient magnetoplasma were varied to simulate a variety of conditions relevant to solar eruptions, examine the relevance of the existing models of the kink-mode oscillations, and investigate the dispersion characteristics of the fast wave.\n",

            "abstract": "Simultaneous source technology allows us to acquire seismic data in a much more efficient way and saves considerable acquisition time. However, it is necessary to separate these data into their conventionally acquired equivalent state. Luckily, we can simply treat the deblending problem as a noise attenuation problem because the blending noise has been performed to be incoherent in some domains such as common receiver, common offset domains. Multichannel matching pursuit (MCMP) is a lateral coherency based technique and has been widely used in a variety of seismic applications such as seismic trace decomposition and denoising seismic records. It decomposes the signals into a series of wavelets namely atoms, but the atom is just the best match to the average of multiple traces with the same scale factor, translation factor, frequency factor and phase parameter at each iteration, which is not in accord with the real seismic records. In this paper, we propose a new multichannel matching pursuit (MCMP) algorithm with directional features for simultaneous source separation in common receiver gathers. The new MCMP uses local lateral coherence as a constraint and utilizes the maximum semblance coefficient within a multidirectional window as the best direction at each iteration. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we use Ricker wavelet to synthetize a simultaneous source data set and sort the data to common receiver gathers. Comparing the deblending results with multidirectional vector median filter (MDVMF) method, the new MCMP preserves more useful seismic signals, but some individual useful signals are not reconstructed successfully probably because of the zero padding influence. The real data examples also prove that the new MCMP is effective in practice for deblending.",

            "abstract": "Ocean redox conditions during the early Cambrian, a critical period in Earth history marked by rapid evolution of animals, are uncertain. Previous studies have suggested well oxic conditions based on Mo isotopes and stratified, anoxic deep waters based on Fe-S-C and trace metal data. The Niutitang Formation (529-514 Ma) at Yangjiaping (South China) consists of a lower black shale member (LM, 0-18 m) and an upper gray silty shale member (UM, 24-80 m). The LM is moderately to strongly enriched in Mo, U and V, and heterogeneous in Mo-isotopic compositions (δ98Mo = ‒0.65‰ to +2.14‰), while the UM shows lesser enrichment of Mo, U and V, higher Mo/U ratios, and intermediate and more uniform δ98Mo (+1.16‰ to +1.71‰). The metal data and previously reported Fe-speciation data suggest a redox change from dominantly euxinic conditions for the LM to suboxic or weakly anoxic-euxinic conditions for the UM, consistent with a shift of the chemocline from the water column to the sediment during a eustatic fall.\nWe propose an “euxinic wedge” model for the δ98Mo patterns observed here. In this model, the early Cambrian ocean exhibited a lateral transition from ferruginous conditions in nearshore areas to euxinic conditions at mid-depths and back to ferruginous conditions in offshore areas. This pattern was the result of terrigenous Fe-Mnox reduction, sulfate resupply via rivers, and hydrothermal inputs of reactive Fe into the deep basin. Within this framework, sedimentary δ98Mo variation in the study units can be explained through the combined effects of Mo isotopic fractionation associated with Fe-Mnox adsorption and depth-dependent H2S concentrations. Importantly, the heaviest δ98Mo values, which were previously interpreted to reflect full oxygenation, can be explained by the operation of a globally widespread Fe-Mn particulate shuttle that removed large quantities of isotopically light Mo to the sediment, leaving seawater enriched in 98Mo.",

            "abstract": "Using MDIS images, we have compiled a database of all impact craters on Mercury with D > 5 km (36K total craters), excluding obvious secondaries (those in chains and clusters). For craters with D > 10 km (12K craters), we have characterized interior and exterior morphology, degradation state, and the presence of post-impact filling. The database represents a unique resource for understanding the resurfacing history of Mercury, examining regional variations in near-surface rheology, and studying the effects of target and impactor properties on final crater forms. We will present initial results on all of these topics. Here we highlight a couple of the significant results. We have used the database to plot the spatial densities of impact craters in different size ranges. Around several fresh peak ring basins over 150 km in diameter, such as Derain (D = 175 km, attached image), at ~4 crater radii from the rim we see an annulus of high spatial density of craters at 5-10 km in diameter that is not present in spatial density plots of craters 10-20 and 20-50 km in diameter. This confirms the presence of a previously hypothesized population of large (D > 5 km) distal secondaries. By virtue of its proximity to the Sun and a mix of asteroidal and cometary impactors, Mercury is expected to have a wide range of impactor velocities. We have been examining fresh craters in the 30-50 and 100-140 km diameter range and sorting them according to proximity to other similar-sized craters, with the idea that craters formed close to each other likely impacted similar targets. If impactor velocity is a significant factor in determining final crater appearance or depth, then there should be noticeable differences between nearby, same-sized craters. We have observed a few possible exceptions that warrant further examination, but generally we find that close-proximity crater pairs/clusters are identical in appearance and shape.",

The relationship between reduction in contaminant mass discharge (CMDR) and mass removal (MR) was used as the metric to examine remediation efficiency. The impacts of well-field configuration on mass removal behavior is attributed to mass-transfer constraints associated with regions of low flow, which can be muted by the influence of permeability heterogeneity. These impacts are reflected in the associated CMDR-MR profiles. Systems whose CDMR-MR profiles are below the 1:1 relationship line are associated with more efficient well-field configurations. The impact of domain heterogeneity on mass-removal effectiveness was investigated in terms of both variance and correlation scale of the random permeability distributions and indexed by the CMDR-MR relationship. Data collected from pump-and-treat operations conducted in a section of the Tucson International Airport Area (TIAA) federal Superfund site were used as a case study. The comparison between simulated and measured site data supports the general validity of the numerical model, and results from the case study are consistent with the conclusions of the theoretical study. These results illustrate that the CMDR-MR relationship can be an effective way to quantify the impacts of different factors on mass-removal efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Since the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, intensive monitoring and modeling works on radionuclide transfer in environment have been carried out.\nAlthough Cesium (Cs) concentration has been attenuating due to both physical and environmental half-life (i.e., wash-off by water and sediment), the attenuation rate depends clearly on the type of land use and land cover. In the Fukushima case, studying the migration in forest land use is important for predicting the long-term behavior of Cs because most of the contaminated region is covered by forests.\nAtmospheric fallout is characterized by complicated behavior in biogeochemical cycle in forests which can be described by biotic/abiotic interactions between many components. In developing conceptual and mathematical model on Cs transfer in forest ecosystem, defining the dominant components and their interactions are crucial issues (BIOMASS, 1997-2001). However, the modeling of fate and transport in geosphere after Cs exports from the forest ecosystem is often ignored.\nAn integrated watershed modeling for simulating spatiotemporal redistribution of Cs that includes the entire region from source to mouth and surface to subsurface, has been recently developed. Since the deposited Cs can migrate due to water and sediment movement, the different species (i.e., dissolved and suspended) and their interactions are key issues in the modeling. However, the initial inventory as source-term was simplified to be homogeneous and time-independent, and biogeochemical cycle in forests was not explicitly considered. Consequently, it was difficult to evaluate the regionally-inherent characteristics which differ according to land uses, even if the model was well calibrated.\nIn this study, we combine the different advantages in modeling of forest ecosystem and watershed. This enable to include more realistic Cs deposition and time series of inventory can be forced over the land surface. These processes are integrated into the watershed simulator GETFLOWS coupled with biogeochemical cycling in forests. We present brief a overview of the simulator and an application for reservoir basin.",

            "abstract": "The eastern boundary fault zone of the Niigata plain (EBFZNP) is about 60 km-long and is distributed in the NNE-SSW direction along a boundary between the Niigata plain and the Echigo-Iide Mts., central Japan. The plain is a very thick sedimentary basin of which the deepest is over 6000 m (JNGA and JOPD, 1992) and the Cretaceous basement rocks are exposed at the Mts. side. This region has been involved in compressive deformation (ca. 3 Ma ~), developing the fold structures, such as Niitsu hills located in the western part of the EBFZNP, in sediment layers and the EBFZNP as a bedding-slip fault along the unconformity between the Miocene and the basement rocks (e.g., Ikeda et al., 2002). In order to clarify more detailed subsurface structures and characteristics of the EBFZNP, we have conducted a gravity survey and analysis around this region.\nA gravity survey was carried out in September 2014 and March 2015. We set four gravity survey lines, one of which corresponds to a seismic survey line (Kato et al., 2013), across the EBFZNP. The number of measurement points is 216. We compiled gravity data measured in this survey and published (Yamamoto et al., 2011; Geological Survey of Japan, AIST, 2013; Geographical Survey Institute of Japan, 2015), and calculated Bouguer anomalies. In order to illustrate discontinuities of the subsurface structures, filtering processes of a horizontal and vertical first-order differential operation were applied to the Bouguer anomalies. We also analyzed density structures along the survey lines using the 2D Talwani’s method (Talwani et al., 1959).\nThe Bouguer anomalies are relatively low in the plain side and 40 mGal higher in the Mts. side. Both of the steep horizontal gradients and the zero isolines of the vertical differentiation, which indicate tectonic discontinuities of the subsurface structure, are continuous and clearly extend along the EBFZNP. These features suggest that the EBFZNP forms a continuous fault structure below the surface. From the density structure analysis, we recognize that the EBFZNP is wholly a west-dipping fault structure and that the Niitsu hills have an anticlinorium structure with a basement high in the south part of the hills and an anticline structure formed in sediment layers in the north part, respectively.\nThis study is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 26400450.",

The data used to calculate the splitting parameters (fast polarization direction and delay time) are from 1949 Earthscope digital broadband seismic stations.

A small set of the stations (45) has consistent splitting parameters for events with different back-azimuths; those observations can be explained by a one-layer simple anisotropy.

            "abstract": "A variety of data requires that the mantle source for basaltic magmatism is heterogeneous. Thanks to numerous experimental studies, parameterizations are available to model the melting behavior of peridotite and pyroxenite compositions that are thought to be present in the mantle (e.g., 1, 2). Based on these parameterizations, numerous studies have attempted to estimate the proportion of pyroxenites in magmatic sources. However, while almost all melting experiments correspond to a batch melting process, it is likely that oceanic basalts are formed by near fractional melting rather than batch melting (e.g., 3). Due to the limited extent of melting of peridotites under upper mantle conditions, their magmatic productivity and melt compositions are similar for batch and fractional melting (e.g., 4). In contrast, pyroxenites undergo much higher meting degrees during decompression of a heterogeneous, peridotite-rich mantle source. Using pMELTS, I investigated the effect of near-fractional melting of pyroxenite. Results suggest that the nature of the melting process for pyroxenites can significantly affect (1) the melt productivity of pyroxenites and thus their potential contribution in basalt genesis, (2) the major element composition of melts and thus their interaction with the surrounding peridodite, and (3) the concentration of minor elements such as Ni and consequently the estimation of pyroxenite proportion in magma-source (e.g., 5). In particular, calculations imply that the proportion of solid pyroxenite in the magma source is likely to be underestimated using “batch melting” rather than “fractional melting” parameterization. An increase in the pyroxenite proportion may affect the buoyancy of the mixture in the upper mantle and have important geodynamical implications. 1-Katz et al., 2003, GGG 4; 2-Lambart et al., 2013, Lithos 160-161; 3- Hirose & Kawamura, 1994, Geophy.

            "abstract": "The Barmer Basin, situated within the West Indian Rift System, is an intra-cratonic rift basin produced during Gondwana break-up. Despite being a prominent oil and gas province, the structural evolution and context of the rift within northwest India remains poorly understood. Substantial subsurface datasets acquired during hydrocarbon exploration provide an unrivalled tool to investigate the tectonic evolution of the Barmer Basin rift and northwest India during India-Asia collision. Here we present a structural analysis using seismic datasets to investigate Barmer Basin evolution and place findings within the context of northwest India development. Present day rift structural architectures result from superposition of two non-coaxial extensional events; an early mid-Cretaceous rift-oblique event (NW-SE), followed by a main Paleocene rifting phase (NE-SW). Three phases of fault reactivation follow rifting: A transpressive, Late Paleocene inversion along localised E-W and NNE-SSW-trending faults; a widespread Late Paleocene-Early Eocene inversion and Late Miocene-Present Day transpressive strike-slip faulting along NW-SE-trending faults and isolated inversion structures. A major Late Eocene-Miocene unconformity in the basin is also identified, approximately coeval with those identified within the Himalayan foreland basin, suggesting a common cause related to India-Asia collision, and calling into question previous explanations that are not compatible with spatial extension of the unconformity beyond the foreland basin. Although, relatively poorly age constrained, extensional and compressional events within the Barmer Basin can be correlated with regional tectonic processes including the fragmentation of Gondwana, the rapid migration of the Greater Indian continent, to subsequent collision with Asia. New insights into the Barmer Basin development have important implications not only for ongoing hydrocarbon exploration but the temporal evolution of northwest India.",

For nine of the total 10 TeSLs, which were observed by a sodium lidar, the adjacent ionospheric observations from the COSMIC radio occultation and ionosondes exhibited abrupt perturbations in the RO SNR profiles and spread Es in the ionograms, respectively, indicating the existence of large-scale complex Es. Further, all the TeSLs, which had the co-observations by a VHF radar located nearby, were accompanied by the E region field-aligned irregularity (FAI) echoes. And seven FAIs (7/10) showed evident upwelling structure covering altitudes of 100 -- 140 km, well correlated with the development of the TeSLs. The occurrence of the large-scale complex Es possibly implies the direct altitude modulation of the horizontal Es layers by the atmospheric waves or the strong eastward polarization electric fields, which contribute the formation the FAI structures. In the course of the altitude modulation of the Es layers, sufficient ions (including sodium ions) and electrons could be accumulated in the upper altitude during the upward motion of the FAI plasma and benefits the formation of TeSLs through the chemical reaction.\nTwo TeSL cases observed at Fort Collins, CO (20.0N), a middle latitude region, during day of year (DOY) 177 - 179 and DOY 191 during the year 2003. The enhanced sodium density in the lower thermospheric region provided the simultaneous observations for the horizontal wind and temperature. The TeSLs observed at Fort Collins had the similar feathers, i.e., they appeared at approximately 110 km and propagated with a downward speed of 1.5 - 2.5 km/hr, meanwhile, the higher temperature with approximately 50K increase and strong horizontal wind shear were accompanied with the TeSLs. Further investigation indicated that the TeSLs might be caused mainly by the ions vertical convergence due to horizontal wind-shear induced by the semi-diurnal tides, and the temperature enhancement at the altitude of 110 km had little contributions to the formation of TeSLs.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Hawthorne earthquake swarm occurred in the central Walker Lane zone, neighboring the border between California and Nevada. The swarm included an Mw 4.4 on April 13, Mw 4.6 on April 17, and Mw 3.9 on April 27. Due to the lack of the near-field seismic instrument, it is difficult to get the accurate source information from the seismic data for these moderate-magnitude events. ENVISAT InSAR observations captured the deformation mainly caused by three events during the 2011 Hawthorne earthquake swarm. The surface traces of three seismogenic sources could be identified according to the local topography and interferogram phase discontinuities. The epicenters could be determined using the interferograms and the relocated earthquake distribution. An apparent earthquake migration is revealed by InSAR observations and the earthquake distribution. Analysis and modeling of InSAR data show that three moderate magnitude earthquakes were produced by slip on three previously unrecognized faults in the central Walker Lane. Two seismogenic sources are northwest striking, right-lateral strike-slip faults with some thrust-slip components, and the other source is a northeast striking, thrust-slip fault with some strike-slip components. The former two faults are roughly parallel to each other, and almost perpendicular to the latter one. This special spatial correlation between three seismogenic faults and nature of seismogenic faults suggest the central Walker Lane has been undergoing southeast-northwest horizontal compressive deformation, consistent with the region crustal movement revealed by GPS measurement. The Coulomb failure stresses on the fault planes were calculated using the preferred slip model and the Coulomb 3.4 software package. For the Mw4.6 earthquake, the Coulomb stress change caused by the Mw4.4 event increased by ~0.1 bar. For the Mw3.9 event, the Coulomb stress change caused by the Mw4.6 earthquake increased by ~1.0 bar. This indicates that the preceding earthquake may trigger the subsequence one. Because no abnormal volcano activity was observed during the 2011 Hawthorne earthquake swarm, we can rule out the volcano activity to induce these events. However, the groundwater change and mining in the epicentral zone may contribute to the 2011 Hawthorne earthquake.",

The Bathyarchaeota bin size ranged from approximately 0.9 to 3.3 Mb, with coverage ranging from approximately 10× to 28×.

In addition, genes encoding glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, beta-oxidation pathways and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (except citrate synthase) were present in all genomic bins highlighting the heterotrophic life style of Bathyarchaeota. The presence of a wide variety of transporters of organic compounds further supports the versatile heterotrophic metabolism of Bathyarchaeota.

We find that as urban land expanses, though emissions are held constant, concentrations of CO, elemental carbon (EC), and PM2.5 tend to decrease near the surface (below ~500 m), but increase at higher altitudes (1–3 km), resulting in a reduced vertical concentration gradient. On the contrary, the O3 burden averaged over all newly urbanized grid cells consistently increases from the surface to a height of about 4 km. The responses of pollutant concentrations to the spatial extent of urbanization are linear near the surface, but nonlinear (or intensified) at higher altitudes. The perturbations in boundary layer height, 2-m temperature and 2-m relative humidity also increase linearly with the spatial extent of urban land expansion (R2 >0.96). Our work indicates that as large tracts of new urban land emerge, the influence of urban expansion on meteorology and air pollution would be significantly amplified. An improved integrated process rate (IPR) analysis scheme is implemented in WRF/Chem to investigate the non-negligible and unique role of urban land forcing in impacting the advection, turbulent mixing, and dry/wet removal of pollutants. IPR indicates that, for primary pollutants, the enhanced sink (source) caused by turbulent mixing and vertical advection in the lower (upper) atmosphere could be a key factor in changes to simulated vertical profiles. The evolution of secondary pollutants is further largely influenced by the upward relocation of precursors that impacts gas-phase chemistry for O3 and aerosol processes for PM2.5. Our preliminary results indicate that this “elevation effects” of urban land expansion could foster the trans-Pacific transport of airborne pollutants, and it is necessary we further quantify and analyze.",

            "abstract": "Geology of the Franciscan subduction complex, California, suggests that megathrust slip at depths of ~15 to 30 km is accommodated in accretionary or non-accretionary modes. During non-accretion or subduction erosion, megathrust slip is accommodated in a narrow zone <50 m thick, based on the narrow primary fault zones separating different accreted units. In contrast, accretion of a unit in a subduction complex involves its transfer from the subducting to the upper plate. During the time a unit is accreted, megathrust slip is accommodated by faults along the upper and lower contacts of the accreted unit as well as internal faults that imbricate the unit. In an accretionary mode, the zone of megathrust slip accommodation is the thickness of the accreted unit, which reaches several km. Subduction slip for a time period can be estimated by plate motion models, and the amount of megathrust slip accommodated during accretion may be crudely estimated by considering the thickness of the repeated imbricates in various accreted units (300-500 m), the total structural thickness accreted in a given time period (10-20 km between 80 and 120 Ma), and a maximum across strike (downdip) extent for an accreted unit (~30 km). 80-120 Ma, the time of accretion of the Eastern and Central Belts of the complex, corresponded to about 3100 km of margin-normal subduction. During this time, slip accommodated by accretion of units at their region of greatest structural thickness may have ranged from 1200 km, for a thicker ‘peel’ of 500 m, to 2000 km, for a thinner ‘peel’ of 300 m; this slip estimate range is about 40 to 60 percent of the total subduction slip during that period. This suggests that even during this 40 Ma period of net accretion, about half of the slip (and about half of the time) was associated with non-accreting events. Although subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, more refined geochronology can test this estimate.",

On sunny days mid-day peroxy radical mixing ratios were typically between 20 and 70 ppt and were well correlated with “HO2*” measured by the Indiana University Laser-Induced Fluorescence with Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (IU-FAGE) instrument. The ratio of total peroxy radicals (UMass) to the IU-FAGE HO2* measurements was greater than two. We also describe results from an informal intercomparison of the two instruments’ calibration sources, which are based on acetone photolysis (UMass) and water photolysis (IU).

            "abstract": "The Korean Peninsula was dislocated laterally by 1-6cm after the 11 March 2011 M9.0 Tohoku-Oki megathrust at a distance of ~1300 km. These lateral displacements produced apparent tensional stresses of 1-7 kPa in the crust of the peninsula, perturbing the medium. Temporal variation of seismic velocities is investigated to assess the lithospheric responses to the megatrust. The Green’s function over inter-station paths are retrieved from ambient noises recorded at broadband seismic stations that are densely deployed over the peninsula. The ambient noises are bandpass-filtered between 0.03 and 0.08 Hz, and spectral whitening and one-bit normalization are applied. The fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves are retrieved by stacking the cross-correlation functions of 10-days-long ambient noises from 2010 to 2015. The traveltime changes of Rayleigh waves with respect to the reference traveltimes are calculated by comparing the stacked cross-correlation functions. The reference Rayleigh waves are calculated by stacking the cross-correlation functions for 4 to 6 months before the megathrust. The traveltime changes are normalized by the inter-station distances. Abrupt traveltime delays are observed right after the megathrust, which are particularly strong along paths subparallel to the great-circle direction to the megathrust. The peak traveltime delay reaches 0.028 s/km, which corresponds to shear velocity decrease of 8.9 %. The traveltime delays are weak along the paths deviated from the great-circle directions. The observation suggests that the transient tension stress field caused longitudinal lithospheric perturbation with preferential mineral orientation and fluid migration, decreasing the seismic velocities. The traveltime delays were recovered with rates of 0.000025 to 0.000059 s/km per day, completing the recovery in several hundred days after the megathrust.",

            "abstract": "Revegetation has become increasingly important for desertified land restoration in arid and semiarid regions. Little is known about the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) after the establishment of shrubland on shifting sand dunes; especially the changes in SOC fractions following planting were poorly understood. 0-10 cm soil samples were collected along chronosequence plots were to: (1) quantitatively analyze the changes of SOC and its fractions over time following the establishment of shrublands on shifting sand dunes; (2) precisely assess the relative contribution of different components to total organic carbon at different times. The results showed that revegetation can promote SOC accumulation in desert regions. SOC increased from 0.33±0.11 g kg-1 in mobile sand dunes to 5.08±0.11 g kg-1 in 57-year shrublands, while the light fraction of organic C (LF-OC) ranged from 0.05±0.02 g kg-1 to 2.96±0.24 g kg-1, the dissolved organic C (DOC) increased from 5.95±0.42 mg kg-1 to 23.63±2.79 mg kg-1 and microbial biomass C (MBC) from 6.54±1.64 mg kg-1 to 135.35±19.49 mg kg-1. Their dynamics patterns can be divided into three stages, i.e. slow increase, fast increase and slow increase stages; especially, both SOC and its fractions showed no significant changes in the first 14 years, which suggested that soil restoration is a slow process in dry environments, and therefore the maintenance of soil habitat is a crucial for land management.\nOur results also demonstrated that revegetation can increase the ratio of labile to stable pools in desert regions. Although, the content of HF-OC significantly increased after afforestation, but its contribution to SOC decreased from 85.15% to 41.52%, implied that more SOC stocks were stabilized in labile pools with the elapse of time, this would give rise to the risk of significant SOC losses caused by potential global warming and human-induced disturbances.",

Earthquakes recorded at epicentral distances of 90°-130° from EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) and SIEDCAR (SC) broadband seismic stations were examined comprehensively, via the Matlab program “Splitlab”, to determine whether SKS and SKKS phases indicated anisotropic properties. Splitlab allows waveforms to be rotated, filtered, and windowed interactively and splitting measurements are made on a user-specified waveform segment via three independent methods simultaneously. To improve signal-to-noise and improve reliability, we stacked the error surfaces that resulted from grid searches in the measurements for each station location.\nFast polarization directions near the Rio Grande Rift tend to be sub-parallel to the RGR but then change to angles that are consistent with North America’s average plate motion, to the east. The surface erosional depression of the Pecos Valley coincides with fast polarization directions that are aligned in a more northerly direction than their neighbors, whereas the topographic high to the east coincides with an easterly change of the fast axis.\nThe area above a mantle high velocity anomaly discovered separately via seismic tomography which may indicate thickened lithosphere, corresponds to unusually large delay times and fast polarization directions that are more closely aligned to a north-south orientation. The area of southeastern New Mexico that falls between the mantle fast anomaly and the Great Plains craton displays dramatically smaller delay times, as well as changes in fast axis directions toward the northeast. Changes in fast axis directions may indicate flow around the mantle anomaly; small delay times could indicate vertical or attenuated flow.",

            "abstract": "Increasing Arctic summer temperatures in recent decades and shrinking cold-based ice caps on Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, are exposing ancient landscapes complete with uneroded bedrock surfaces. Previous work has indicated that these upland surfaces covered with cold-based ice experience negligible erosion compared with the valleys and fjords systems that contain fast-flowing ice. Given the appearance of highly weathered bedrock, it is argued that these landscapes have remained largely unchanged since at least the last interglaciation (~120 ka), and have likely experienced multiple cycles of ice expansion and retraction with little erosion throughout the Quaternary. To explore this hypothesis, we use multiple cosmogenic radionuclides (26Al and 10Be) to investigate and provide insight into longer-term cryosphere activity and landscape evolution. 26Al/10Be in surfaces recently exposed exhibit a wide range of exposure-burial histories. Total exposure-burial times range from ~0.3 – 1.5 My and estimated erosion rates from 0.5 – 6.2 m Ma-1. The upland surfaces of the Penny Ice cap generally experienced higher erosion rates (~0.45 cm ka-1) than those covered by smaller ice caps (~0.2 cm ka-1). The cumulative burial/exposure histories in high, fjord-edge locations indicate that significant erosion north of the Penny Ice Cap ceased between ~600 and 800 ka, suggesting that Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) organization and fjord inception was underway by at least this time. Additionally, 26Al/10Be ratios near production values despite high inventories from a coastal summit 50 km east of the Penny Ice Cape suggest that that area has not experienced appreciable burial by ice, suggesting that it was never inundated by the LIS. Moreover, these initial data suggest a variable and dynamic cryosphere in the region and provide insight into how large ice sheets evolved and organized themselves during the Quaternary.",

Some available historical records of China evidenced that there is a good relationship between cropland coverage and population in preindustrial periods, which was one of the methods used by Goldewijk (2001). Goldewijk (2001) also noted that historical data is particularly important for validating integrated models of environmental change. Therefore, a simple approach was used to derive geographically explicit changes of historical croplands distribution over the past 2220 years in China based on refining the relationship between croplands and population in this study. By collecting historical croplands data and population from different historical population records, we derived a Chinese representation of croplands over the past 2220 years. We compiled a dataset of Chinese historical croplands data, at the province level, based on the historical population data of China. Moreover, we used ArcGIS application to digitize all of the past 2220 year’s historical maps and natural landscapes (e.g. rivers, mountains, and lakes etc.) of China for presenting historical croplands distribution in China. By overlaying the historical croplands distribution maps of China over the modern-day map of China based on latitude and longitude; we can identify those historical croplands’ locations on the modern-day map of China. Finally, for the each and every year we can develop a historical cropland distribution map and a historical cropland density map to present the land-cover change. We believe that the estimation and the resulting dataset will facilitate the development of regional and global climate and ecosystem models to simulate and understand the effects of land-cover change on climate and the cycling of carbon and water.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity in river deltas between distributary channels and inter-channel islands brings sediment and nutrients onto islands resulting in distinct vegetation zonation patterns on island interiors. Deltaic islands can also remain inundated for long periods of time, providing the conditions for denitrification to occur. To understand these dynamics and the overall complexity of the deltaic plain, water, sediment, and nutrient fluxes need to be considered at the network scale. Some key questions are what effect does external environmental forcing, such as river discharge, wind, and tides, have on spatial patterns in the delta, and what role do internal dynamics play in deltaic evolution.\nWe apply the mutual information and transfer entropy metrics to quantify couplings between environmental controls and delta variables on islands and channels in Wax Lake Delta, a naturally prograding 100km2 river delta in coastal Louisiana, USA. Mutual information measures the amount of shared information in a coupling, while the transfer entropy measures the information transfer between two variables. With this method, we are able to analyze different dimensional variables across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Continuous water levels, water temperature, and turbidity data were collected in three channels and on five islands from November 2013 to August 2014. Continuous surface water nitrate concentrations were collected at six locations on one island in the delta during the summer of 2015. The data occur over a suite of discharge, wind, and tidal conditions. While discharge is a predominant force, winds and tides play a significant role in water movement and residence time inside the islands. Nitrate fluctuations, in response to environmental forcing, vary spatially and temporally at the island scale, which will have an effect on nitrate dynamics on island interiors. Turbidity and water levels show variation at the network scale, leading to patterns of inundation across the delta.",

Economic trade is increasingly of interest to the scientific community due to the natural resources (e.g. water, carbon, nutrients, etc.) embodied in traded commodities. Trade refers to the spatial and temporal redistribution of commodities, and is typically measured annually between countries. However, commodity exchange networks occur at many different scales, though data availability at finer temporal and spatial resolution is rare. Exchange networks may prove an important adaptation measure to cope with future climate and economic shocks. As such, it is essential to understand how commodity exchange networks scale, so that we can understand opportunities and roadblocks to the spatial and temporal redistribution of goods and services. To this end, we present an empirical analysis of trade systems across three spatial scales: global, sub-national in the United States, and county-scale in the United States. We compare and contrast the network properties, the self-sufficiency ratio, and performance of the gravity model of trade for these three exchange systems.",

Results show that annual precipitation had obvious inter-annual variability, and the variation of soil moisture; evaporation and CO2 flux were very consistently with the annual cycle and intensity of precipitation. Soil moisture is the key participant in land-atmosphere interaction. However, as the water shortage and disconnected from water table over the semi-arid region, it is much more sensitive with precipitation compensation and evaporation feedbacks. Soil water can cooling the near surface air temperature by evaporation (latent heat flux), and also as the main energy partitioning consumer of net radiation in humid area or pluvial period in arid area, yet it was water limited in arid and semi-arid region, sensible heat flux predominated net radiation for enhancing the surface air temperature. We also found that soil moisture profile significantly affected the plant physiology, which was also consistent with the annual cycle and intensity of precipitation.",

            "abstract": "We report on measurements of soil hydrological and thermal properties from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica (MDV), and relate them to changes in the spatial patterns of shallow groundwater flow (water tracks), landscape subsidence (thermokarst), and microbial and invertebrate ecosystem response. We show that shallow groundwater in the MDV is primarily derived from snowfall and seasonal ground ice melt, but is evaporatively concentrated during the summer flow period to produce saline to hypersaline active layer solutions. Multi-year profiles of soil temperature and soil moisture indicate that water track flow is largely limited to the duration of active layer conditions (~2 months) and that water track discharge is characterized by an early season pulse as ground ice melts, and a late season pulse as solutions flowing downslope accumulate at the base of the water tracks. Evaporative concentration of water track fluids, coupled with soil salt dissolution, and/or cation exchange reactions, result in enrichment of water track fluids in chloride and sulfate salts (depending on local soil chemistry) such that initially fresh snowmelt becomes saline to hypersaline over several km of groundwater flow. These brines shape soil ecosystems in the MDV by controlling salinity-dependent habitat suitability for invertebrates and microbial organisms. We show that these soil salts and shallow groundwater solutions accumulate in local depressions to form ponds, and that where these ponds are located above buried ice, the presence of salts leads to expansion of the basins to form large thermokarst depressions. Because water tracks are primarily snow-fed, and are moderated by shallow groundwater processes, they represent a component of the Antarctic hydrological system that is likely to respond rapidly to regional changes in temperature and precipitation, altering Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, carbon budgets, and ground ice distribution.",

Annual decrease from the same month in the previous year shows a clear oscillation due to orbit precession correlated with trapped energetic proton flux up to 1996. Although phase of the oscillation in annual variation shows a clear correlation, the amplitude tends to be larger than that expected from a degradation model based on energetic proton distribution of the NASA’s AP8 model. We have worked on modelling of the L-shell distribution of trapped energetic protons which provides best-fit for the degradation of solar cells. The results by assuming Gaussian distribution of proton flux for L value are as follows. (1) If we assume a steady state before 1996, the best-fitted distribution has a peak around L=1.6 and a width of dL=0.1 (i.e., half width of 1/e decrease from the peak). (2) If we employ a dynamic model with temporal variation and introduce a different distribution between April 1991 and June 1992, RMSE is further improved from the static model. Modeled distributions have its center around L=1.9, suggesting outward shift or expansion of the proton radiation belt during the interval. Our modeling gives more confined distribution than given by the AP8 and AP9 models, but is more consistent with the CRRESPRO model based on the observation before November 1991.",

            "abstract": "The cosmogenic isotope 10Be has been proved as a potential source for the understanding of soil and landscape development and climate change in a variety of Earth’s surface terrestrial archives such as soils, loess and ice sheets. After being produced in the atmosphere, the deposited 10Be by precipitation and dust enters mainly the inorganic cycle and accumulates on the surface of soil particles with little loss to the subsurface. Most of the estimates for the preipitaion-10Be input were performed for archives stretching back in time without a region wide data on 10Be atmospheric deposition. Although not entirely reflecting atmospheric depositional flux, the bulk of the isotope concertation strongly indicates atmospheric input and soil development processes. In the report presented here, measurement of 10Be in surface soils (top 5-10 cm) from China are combined with data on atmospheric flux (wet and dry) to estimate present soil development and correlation to precipitation rates. The results indicate variability in 10Be concentration from 0.27×108 to 35.38×108 atoms/g and show that higher concentrations are found in high precipitation region while regions with extensive precipitation show a possible dilution effect. Also it seems that mature soils along river pathways retain more 10Be than soils on dry lands and high elevation. A positive correlation between average precipitation rate and 10Be distribution suggests 10Be-precipitation relationship if the dilution effect can be eliminated. In addition, estimate of 10Be deposition using atmospheric flux models suggest differences between regions, with the highest values comparable to trend shown by the empirical data. Although, the data do not cover depth profiles that can reflect past time processes in the soils, the distribution pattern and correlation with precipitation suggest high potential for using 10Be as proxy of precipitation back in time.",

Four main large-scale ionospheric disturbances are identified from reanalysis: (1) The positive storm during the initial phase; (2) The SED (storm enhanced density) structure in both northern and southern hemisphere; (3) The large positive storm in main phase; (4) The significant negative storm in middle and low latitude during recovery phase. We then run the NCAR-TIEGCM model with Heelis electric potential empirical model as polar input. The TIEGCM can reproduce 3 of 4 large-scale structures (except SED) very well. We then further analyzed the altitudinal variations of these large-scale disturbances and found several interesting things, such as the altitude variation of SED, the rotation of positive/negative storm phase with local time. Those structures could not be identified clearly by traditional used data sources, which either has no gloval coverage or no vertical resolution. The drivers such as neutral wind/density and electric field from TIEGCM simulations are also analyzed to self-consistantly explain the identified disturbance features.",

            "abstract": "Different geophysical methods are used to study and map submarine permafrost on the Arctic Shelf. Due to specific features of submarine permafrost, none of geophysical methods can provide conclusive data when gas-charged sediments and taliks occur within permafrost. Experimental data show that electrical properties of frozen grounds change significantly. For example, depending on ground lithology and wetness, electrical resistivity can increase up to 103 times upon freezing. Thus, electromagnetic methods could be considered more informative and valuable tool for characterizing subsea permafrost. Investigation of submarine permafrost on the shallow Arctic Shelf requires modifications of electromagnetic methods to cover specific needs of working from the fast ice. Winter expeditions devoted to subsea permafrost investigations were performed in March-April of 2012-2015 in the near-shore area of the Laptev Sea. TEM was applied to predict permafrost down to 1 km depth. TEM systems are advantageous when many stations are required, because many short deployments can be performed in a single survey. Working from the fast ice allowed collection of few tens of stations to cover the entire polygon. Interpretation of data collected in 2012 allowed to predict position of the permafrost table near-shore near Muostakh Island, which was validated by followed up permafrost drilling. Surveys performed in 2013-2015 also confirmed good agreement between electromagnetic data and observational data obtained by drilling. Accuracy of the methods reached 3.5%. Note, that in March-April of 2014 and 2015, we used the modified TEM which allows obtaining continuous subsea permafrost table profiles.",

We interpret the whole event in two different phases: preflare and main flare. The preflare phase was associated with the formation of sigmoid via tether-cutting type reconnection between the sheared field. The main phase also started with similar type reconnection between the sheared fields below the pre existing sigmoid structure at the circular polarity inversion line and the subsequent eruption of sigmoid. The multiwavelength observations as well as nonlinear force-free field extrapolation analysis show evidence of a large-scale fan-spine type magnetic configuration, with a sigmoid lying under a section of the fan dome. We are proposing the following scenario for the main event. The initial low lying tether-cutting type reconnection was believed to be responsible for the eruption of sigmoid. There after the reconnection occurred in the wake of the erupting sigmoid between the surrounding arcades, resulting in the formation of standard ribbons. In the next stage we believe the reconnection at the magnetic null point higher in the corona responsible for the formation of the extended large-scale quasi-circular ribbon.",

Both seagrass beds and coral reefs could prevent the coastline from erosion. While seagrass stabilizes sediments and acts as a biofilter, coral reefs can control carbon dioxide in the ocean water. Besides, seagrass also provides direct food for many fish and marine animals. Therefore, mapping seagrass beds and coral reefs is very important for coastal management and conservation. In May 2013, Vietnam launched the first satellite for earth observations, called Vietnam Natural Resources, Environment and Disaster Monitoring Satellite (VNREDSAT-1). It is a great opportunity for environmental monitoring in the country using the data from this satellite. The objective of this study is to use the VNREDSAT-1 data to map seagrass beds and coral reefs in the coastal region of Ninh Hai district, Ninh Thuan province, Vietnam, where the seagrass still remains in good a condition. We processed the VNREDSAT-1 image through four steps: (1) Atmospheric correction using Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum radiative transfer model (6S), (2) Sun glint removal by using Hedley method, (3) Water column correction using the depth-variant index (DII) proposed by Lyzenga, and (4) Image classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm. The mapping results verified with the ground reference data showed a good overall accuracy of 75% and Kappa coefficient of 0.7. The total area of seagrass beds was approximately 323.09 ha, which mainly distributed in My Hoa and Thai An villages. The total area of coral reefs was approximately 564.42 ha, located along the coast and on outer area to seagrass and shoreline reefs. This study demonstrates the applicability of VNREDSAT-1 for underwater habitat monitoring. The results could be useful for natural resources managers to devise strategies for management and conservation of underwater ecosystems in Vietnam.",

We derived the dynamical equations for these wave modes using two-fluid model and then solved numerically to analyze power spectra as well as wave localization at different instants of time. The ponderomotive force associated with the pump is responsible for the wave localization and these localized structures become more chaotic as the system evolves with time until the modulational instability (or oscillating two-stream instability) mentioned here, saturates. We observe steepening of the spectra as we go from inertial range to the dispersion range i.e. nearly k-1.67 to k-3.0. The steepening of spectra may be described as the transfer of energy from longer scale to the smaller scale. The formation of complex magnetic filaments and change in the spectral index may be responsible for the charged particles acceleration in the solar wind plasma.",

The hygroscopicity of BC coatings can strongly influence the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and optical properties of BC-containing particles. In this study, we measured the hygroscopicity parameter k for both BC-coating materials (kBC-coat) and BC-free particles (kBC-free) in the urban atmosphere of Tokyo, using a single particle soot photometer (SP2). In our measurement system, dry ambient particles were first mass-selected by an aerosol particle mass analyzer, then humidified, and then passed to the SP2 laser for detection. There the refractory BC mass content and optical diameter of individual humidified particles were measured by the SP2. During the observation period, the measured kBC-coat generally agreed with kBC-free to within ±25%, and was usually in typical range for inorganic and organic aerosols. These results indicate that BC-coating materials and BC-free particles in Tokyo usually had similar chemical compositions, internal mixtures of inorganic and organic compounds, even in a source region. Occasionally kBC-coat was much higher than kBC-free values, when the mass concentrations of BC and organic aerosols were poorly correlated. This indicates external mixing of BC-containing and BC-free particles from different sources. These findings improve our understanding of the CCN activity of BC-containing particles, which strongly influences their wet removal, and optical properties in the ambient air.",

However, details of variability in the different components of water supply to watersheds are generally missing. We present here evaluation of isotopic changes in small watershed (0.19 km2) in the upstream of Xin’an River, Anhui province, China based on daily sampling of rainfall events and runoff (river and soil water). The δ2H and δ18O of different water sources in the watershed were aimed in order explore interactions between different parts of the hydrological processes. The collected water samples were analyzed for δ2H and δ18O using Picarro L-2120i analyzer at a precision of 1.0 and 0.1 ‰, respectively. The results indicated higher abundance of 2H and 18O in precipitation than those in river. Additionally, the content of the heavy isotopes also decreases in soil water with depth, while surface soil water was enriched because of evaporation. The response of the watershed to the changes in δ2H and δ18O varied, where water in upstream gained more heavy isotopes rapidly, while in the downstream part the enrichment happened after a few days. This feature suggests a different but still strong hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater in the small watershed tested here. Accordingly, variability of δ2H and δ18O should be carefully evaluated on a local scale before application in transport system of large rivers and exchange with groundwater.",

Our results showed that the presence of MWCNT with concentration ranging from 0.05 to 1 g/L inhibited the reduction of hematite (Fe2O3) by up to 35%, likely due to the toxicity effects of MWCNTs. However, the microbially-reduced MWCNTs (0.1 g/L) stimulated the reduction of Fe(III) by 3.6 times, indicating the potential role of MWCNTs as an electron shuttle. These results suggest MWCNTs play a dual role in regulating the microbial reduction of hematite through both toxicity effects and electron shuttle. We plan to further explore the mechanism for the impact of MWCNTs on the redox reactions of iron by studying the influences of carboxyl functionalized MWCNTs, analyzing the impact of MWCNTs on bacterial growth and characterizing the quinone functional groups in MWCNTs. Potential results will provide a novel perception for the impact of CNTs on the biogeochemical cycles of iron.The worldwide carbon nanotubes (CNTs) industry is rapidly expanding with production capacity exceeding several thousand tons per year. After the service lives, CNTs will be ultimately released into the environment with their concentrations in soils increasing by 0.4-147 ng/kg/year and the consequent environmental impacts have received more and more attentions.

            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to pinpoint the beginning of interaction of two gigantic crustal structures: the Siberian Craton and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). We hypothesize that the beginning of convergence should be recorded in the Neoproterozoic passive margin strata of Siberian Craton by the first appearance of extraregional Neoproterozoic zircons. In order to test this hypothesis, we have acquired U-Pb zircon age distributions from twelve Neoproterozoic clastic rocks from the Baikal-Patom margin of Siberia and one sample from the volcaniclastic Padrinsky Group that was deposited atop accreted CAOB crust.\nStratigraphically lower strata from the Siberian margin yield Archean - Paleoproterozoic detrital zircon ages, which are similar to, and probably derived from the Siberian Precambrian craton. A few extra-regional Mesoproterozoic grains are also present.\nThe provenance shift happens in the upper portion of the section and is marked by a strong influx of extra-regional Neoproterozoic sediments. The youngest grains of 610 Ma constrain the sedimentation age and confine the timing of interaction between CAOB and Siberia in this region. Neoproterozoic zircons also dominate the overlying sedimentary unit, suggesting the continuance of the convergence. The coeval volcanoclastic unit on the CAOB side has a similar U-Pb detrital age distribution, strengthening the provenance link.\nAnalysis of the local tectonics suggests that the beginning of accretion might have started even before the first appearance of Neoproterozoic zircon: during the development of a regional unconformity, capped by 635 Ma (?) \"Snowball Earth\" tillites of Dzhemkukan Fm. The absence of Neoproterozoic zircons in Dzhemkukan Fm. is probably explained by a thin-skinned tectonics that did not result in massive orogenesis .\nOur data are in good correlation with other Neoproterozoic sedimentary basins of southern Siberian Craton, including Cisbaikalia and Bodaibo Synclinorium.",

            "abstract": "Viscous fingering is a hydrodynamic instability that occurs when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one. Instead of progressing as a uniform front, the less viscous fluid forms fingers that vary in size and shape to create complex patterns. Understanding how these patterns and their associated gradients evolve over time is of critical importance in characterizing the mixing of two fluids, which in turn is important to applications such as enhanced oil recovery and microfluidics.\nMixing relies on the presence of concentration gradients. In this work, we determine the concentration field experimentally during the injection of a fluid into a circular Hele-Shaw cell to displace a more viscous fluid. We use a fluorescent tracer with the injected fluid to obtain high-resolution concentration fields, from which we determine the concentration gradients for different fluid injection rates and various viscosity ratios. Areas where gradients are present constitute the mixing zone, which can be characterized by its length and its thickness. We observe two regimes in its thickness: an initial regime with constant thickness and a latter regime where the thickness scales as the square root of time. We present here the factors causing these two regimes and the overall effect this has on mixing, as characterized by measures of mixing such as mixing efficiency and scalar dissipation rate.\nUsing this information, we develop quantitative models of the dynamics of the interface length (previous work) and mixing zone thickness, and propose a scaling theory for the growth of the mixing zone and the overall impact of viscous fingering on mixing.",

            "abstract": "Modern seismological analyses are difficult to carry out for earthquakes which occurred in the early period of instrumental observation (between 1870’s to 1920’s in Japan) because of sparse station distributions and low quality of data particularly clock errors. Source parameters of such old earthquakes can be estimated through comparisons of old data with recent seismological data with known hypocenters and focal mechanism solutions. In this study, we constructed a new method to determine hypocenters and focal mechanism solutions for semi-historical earthquakes using template matching technique. To quantify the similarity in hypocentral locations between recent and semi-historical earthquakes, we use RMS of S-P time differences. As for focal mechanism solutions, we calculated weighted (by the normalized P-wave amplitudes) misfit rate between observed first-motion polarities and expected polarities from recent focal mechanism solutions.\nWe confirmed the effectiveness of this method by applying it to recent earthquakes and comparing the distribution of RMS S-P time differences and weighted misfit rates with hypocenters and focal mechanism solutions determined by the Japan Meteorological Agency. RMS S-P time differences show small values around the true hypocenter and the weighted misfit rates become small for the true focal mechanism solutions.\nWe then preliminarily applied this method to several large earthquakes in semi-historical period. For the M6.8 earthquake of 1922 in the Kanto region, Japan, the six S-P times are similar to those reported from recent intermediate-depth earthquakes in the southern part of Chiba Prefecture. The thirteen first-motion polarities are consistent with those expected from recent strike-slip or normal-faulting types of earthquakes at depth 60-70 km within subducting Philippine Sea slab in this region. Such earthquakes are active along the western edge of slab-slab contact zone between the Philippine Sea and Pacific Plates.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the features of atmospheric circulation and moisture transport associated with two modes of decadal variability in the North Pacific: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), with emphasis on the multi-scale water vapor transport and atmospheric river (AR) over the North Pacific region. During the positive phase of PDO, the geopotential height anomaly at 500 hPa exhibits a Pacific-North American like pattern. During the positive phase of NPGO, the geopotential height anomaly at 500 hPa features a dipole pattern with a negative anomaly north of 40°N and a positive anomaly south of 40°N over the North Pacific. Associated with the positive PDO phase, the ocean-to-land moisture transport is enhanced between 25°N and 35°N and reduced over the Northeast Pacific for the time-mean integrated vapor transport (IVT). The synoptic poleward transport is suppressed north of 40°N and enhanced south of 40°N. In the positive NPGO phase, the zonal moisture transport is intensified south of 20°N and between 40°N and 50°N for the time-mean IVT and weakened over the west coast of North America for the low-frequency IVT. The synoptic poleward transport is suppressed south of 30°N. The eastern part of the North Pacific AR belt moves southward during positive PDO as the entire North Pacific AR belt shifts slightly northward during positive NPGO. An investigation on AR anomalies during a period over which the PDO and NPGO coexist demonstrates that the AR frequency over the North American western coastal regions is significantly influenced by the conjunction of the PDO and NPGO modes.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the subsurface structure of the Western Transverse Ranges (WTR) is critical to assess the seismic potential of large thrust faults comprising this fold-and-thrust belt. Several models have been advanced over the years, building on new data and understandings of thrust belt architecture, but none of these efforts have incorporated the full range of data, including style and rates of late Quaternary deformation in conjunction with surface geology, sub-surface well data and offshore seismic data. In our models, we suggest that the nearly continuous backbone with continuous stratigraphy of the Santa Ynez Mountains is explained by a large anticlinorium over a deep structural ramp, and that the current thrust front is defined by the southward-vergent Pitas Point-Ventura fault. The Ventura Avenue anticline and trend is an actively deforming fault propagation fold over the partially blind Pitas Point-Ventura fault. Details of how this fault is resolved to the surface are not well constrained, but any deformation model must account for the several back-thrusts that ride in the hanging wall of the thrust sheet, as well as the localized subsidence in Carpenteria and offshore Santa Barbara. Our preliminary starting model is a modification of a recently published model that invokes ramp-flat structure, with a deep ramp under the Santa Ynez Mountains, a shallower “flat” with considerable complexity in the hanging wall and a frontal ramp comprising the San Cayetano and Pitas Point thrusts. With the inferred deep ramp under the Santa Ynez Range, this model implies that large earthquakes may extend the entire length of the anticlinorium from Point Conception to eastern Ventura Basin, suggesting that the potential for a large earthquake is significantly higher then previously assumed.",

            "abstract": "Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) are not consistent across the CMIP5 model simulations because LULC distribution was determined in each model by unique application of land use change to model-specific initial land cover states. Such differences impede understanding of the carbon cycle and climate because differences in LULC change can both dominate, via emissions, and alter, via biome extent, other sources of uncertainty in the global carbon cycle, such as the effects of CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition on terrestrial ecosystems. For example, the Community Earth System model overestimates 2005 atmospheric CO2 concentration by ~20 ppmv, and we explore the contribution of historical LULC trajectory to this bias in relation to the effects of CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition on terrestrial carbon. Switching from the default, year-2000-referenced LULC trajectory to a chronological LULC trajectory actually increases the bias by about 70%, and the difference in atmospheric CO2 concentration could be ~9 ppmv between a “pasture rule” scenario that preferentially uses non-forest for new pasture and a “crop rule” scenario that preferentially uses forest for new cropland. These atmospheric differences correspond to changes of 28 and 17 Pg of total land ecosystem carbon, respectively. We will compare these results to additional scenarios with static CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition to assess the relative contributions of each of these factors to carbon cycle and climate uncertainties. We will also evaluate extreme forest clearing and retention scenarios to determine a potential uncertainty envelope due to land use conversion assumptions. Our current results suggest that the initial forest area is too high and thus contributes to the 2005 bias in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This highlights the need for more accurate LULC scenarios in earth system simulations to provide robust historical and future projections of carbon and climate.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s albedo is the primary determinant of the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth-atmosphere system. The main factor controlling albedo is the amount of clouds present, but aerosols can affect and alter both clear-sky and cloudy-sky reflectance. How albedo depends on cloud fraction and how albedo varies at a given cloud fraction and a given cloud water content, reveals information about these aerosol effects on the radiation budget. Hence, the relation between total albedo and cloud fraction can be used for illustration and quantification of aerosol effects, and as a diagnostic tool, to test model performance.\nHere, we show examples of the utilisation of this relation focusing on satellite observations from CERES and MODIS on Aqua, as well as from Calipso and CloudSat, and performing comparisons with climate models on the way:\nIn low-cloud regions in the subtropics, we find that climate models well represent a near-constant regional cloud albedo, and this representation has improved from CMIP3 to CMIP5. CMIP5 models indicate more reflective clouds in present-day climate than pre-industrial, as a result of increased aerosol burdens. On monthly mean time scale, models are found to over-estimate the regional cloud-brightening due to aerosols.\nOn the global scale we find an increasing cloud albedo with increasing cloud fraction - a relation that is very well defined in observations, and less so in CMIP5 models. Cloud brightening from pre-industrial to present day is also seen on global scale.\nFurther, controlling for both cloud fraction and cloud water content we can trace small variations in albedo, or perturbations of solar reflectivity, that create a near-global coherent geographical pattern that is consistent with aerosol impacts on climate, with albedo enhancement in regions dominant of known aerosol sources and suppression of albedo in regions associated with high rates of aerosol removal (deduced using CloudSat precipitation estimates). This mapping can be done with CERES and MODIS over the ocean. Using the integrated attenuated backscatter from the Calipso lidar as a proxy for the atmospheric contribution to albedo, it can be extended to include land-covered areas, yielding a global picture of the albedo perturbation footprint.",

Following the analysis of salt rich ice grains emitted by Enceladus that indicated a salt-water ocean in contact with the moon’s rocky core [1,2] a recent CDA analysis of nano-phase silica particles pointed at hydrothermal activity at the moon’s rock/water interface [3]. The results imply temperatures above 80 - 90°C and alkaline pH values around 10 reminiscent of alkaline hydrothermal vents on Earth like the Lost City Hydrothermal Field.\nIn this context the compositional analysis of organic components in CDA mass spectra of the ejected ice grains is of particular relevance. A multitude of volatile organic species has already been identified in the gas component of the plume [4]. As expected, we find more complex organic molecules in ice grains than in the gas indicating aromatic species, amines, and carbonyl group species. The composition of organic-bearing ice grains displays a great diversity indicating a variety of different organic species in varying concentrations. Recent spatially resolved CDA in situ measurements inside Enceladus’ plume indicate that these organic compounds are especially frequent in ‘young’ ice grains that have just been ejected by high velocity jets.\nWe investigate the implications of our findings with respect to ice grain formation at the water surface and inside the icy vents. We constrain the generation of organic compounds at the rock/water interface in the light of hydrothermal activity and the potential for the formation of life precursor molecules in Enceladus’ ocean.\nRef:[1] Postberg et al., Nature 459, 1098-1101 (2009).

            "abstract": "The kinematics of the Hellenic subduction zone have long been enigmatic; while GPS and seismological data suggest that subduction is mostly aseismic, there is reliable historical evidence for several large (MW~8) earthquakes in the past. The origins of the Hellenic Trench System, a group of bathymetric escarpments within the overriding plate, are also widely debated. Since most of the region is underwater, earthquake seismology provides the best hope of understanding its kinematics, but reliable estimates of source depth are required to distinguish between earthquakes in the overriding and downgoing plates. We critically review previously assigned earthquake mechanisms and depths and (where data are available) use body-waveform modelling and array seismology to constrain them further, providing an updated catalogue of the seismicity of the Hellenic subduction zone since 1957. We also present new radiocarbon dates from uplifted paleoshorelines on the island of Rhodes, which show that its coast was uplifted in a large (MW > 7.5) reverse-faulting earthquake around 4000 years BP. Seismological and reflection seismic data suggest that this earthquake and the one responsible for uplift of Crete in AD 365 occurred on steep reverse faults within the overriding lithosphere, presenting a resolution for the paradox of occasional large earthquakes in a region of predominantly aseismic subduction and also a plausible mechanism for the formation of the Hellenic Trench System. The presence of flights of Quaternary marine terraces suggests that uplift of these islands is ongoing, but it is important to distinguish between the effects of the reverse faulting and those of the widespread normal faulting throughout the Aegean; although it seems probable that uplift of Crete and Rhodes is related to reverse faulting, seismological and field evidence suggests that Karpathos (the island between them) is being uplifted as a horst block, as part of arc-parallel extension of the overriding plate.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Tidal response of underground water level is useful to study damage zones of causative faults of large earthquakes. A detailed analysis on the spectrum characteristics of the water level data acquired from the borehole of over 800m deep inside the Wenchuan earthquake fault zone suggests that water level correlates well with the earth tide. The tidal constituents of O1 (25.819h), K1 (23.934h), M2 (12.421h), S2 (12.000h) can be easily recognized from the spectrum map of the water level data. The tidal constituent M2 may play the most important role on the water level variation among these four tidal constituents because of its strongest spectrum amplitude. Further analysis shows that the tidal constituents of Mf (13.661d) and Mm (27.555d) may also play a role in the water level variation. According to a newest study of our group which suggests that the tidal force M2 has a close relationship with a special type of georesistivity pulses which appeared before large earthquakes, we suppose that there may exist a correlation between the tide force related water level variations and formation of the pulses.\nKey words: Tidal force, Water Level, Spectrum Characteristics, Earthquake",

            "abstract": "Large quantities of the greenhouse gas CH4 are produced in anoxic sediments of continental margins and may be liberated to the overlying water column, and later into the atmosphere. Indeed, coastal seas account for more than 75% of global oceanic CH4 emissions. Yet, aerobic CH4 oxidizing bacteria (MOB) consume an important part of CH4 in the water column, thus mitigating CH4 release to the atmosphere. Coastal oceans are highly dynamic systems, in particular with regard to the variability of temperature, salinity and oxygen concentrations, all of which are potential key environmental factors controlling MOx. To determine the most important controlling factors, we conducted a two-year time-series study with measurements of CH4, MOx, the composition of the MOB community, and physicochemical water column parameters in a coastal inlet in the Baltic Sea (Eckernförde(E-) Bay, Boknis Eck Time Series Station). In addition, we investigated the influence of temperature and oxygen on MOx during controlled laboratory experiments. In E-Bay, seasonal stratification leads to hypoxia in bottom waters towards the end of the stratification period. Methane is produced year-round in the sediments, resulting in accumulation of methane in bottom waters, and supersaturation (with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium) in surface waters. Here, we will discuss the factors impacting MOx the most, which were a) perturbations of the water column caused by storm events, currents or seasonal mixing, b) temperature and c) oxygen concentration. a) Perturbations of the water column led to a sharp decrease in MOx within hours, probably caused by replacement of ‘old’ water with a high standing stock of MOB by ‘new’ waters with a lower abundance of MOB. b) An increase in temperature generally led to higher MOx rates. c) Even though CH4 was abundant at all depths, MOx was highest in bottom waters (1-5 nM/d), which usually contain the lowest O2 concentrations. Lab-based experiments with adjusted O2 concentrations in the range of 0.2 - 220 µM confirmed a sub-micromolar O2 optimum. Additionally, the metabolic fate of CH4-carbon at low (<0.5 µM) and high (~200 µM) O2 concentrations was investigated during incubations with 14C-CH4. The results suggest a differential partitioning of catabolic and anabolic processes at different O2 concentrations.",

            "abstract": "An ensemble data assimilation system is used to assess the impact of assimilating satellite infrared radiance data in both clear and cloudy skies on the analysis and forecast of severe weather and tropical cyclones. The new generation geostationary satellite infrared radiance data, including those from AHI onboard Himawara-8 launched in October 2014 and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on GOES-R to be launched in 2016, have or will have near global coverage at all times with high spatial and temporal resolution. GOES-R will provide two times higher spatial and temporal resolution radiance data than the satellites currently in orbit. Both contain 10 infrared channels with 2 km x 2 km spatial resolution with images produced every 15 minutes. The assimilation of such high-resolution satellite observations in both clear and cloudy skies is challenging given their strong non-linear relationships to the underlying model fields, the general lack of effective quality control on them, the need to apply bias corrections to them, and the necessity of data synthesizing and thinning for their application to regional scale numerical weather prediction. These difficulties are especially relevant to the cloudy radiances. For the current study we couple the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) to the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system developed at Penn State University (PSU) and built around the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). This new framework, together with our assimilation strategies that include superobbing and effective data quality control, enables us to directly assimilate multiple channel brightness temperatures with high temporal and spatial resolution into the EnKF. The impact of assimilating brightness temperatures from these new advanced imagers is assessed through both examining the dynamical covariance between the satellite radiances and the state variables estimated from an ensemble and performing extensive observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). Preliminary experiments show promising improvements in hurricane initialization and forecasting via assimilation of these next generation brightness temperatures. Ongoing research explores the potential impact of all-sky GOES-R radiance assimilation for other severe and convective weather phenomena.",

In the leading plasma of this shower electric currents are induced that generate radio waves which have been detected with LOFAR, a large and dense array of simple antennas primarily developed for radio-astronomy observations.\nLOFAR has observed air showers under fair-weather conditions as well as under atmospheric conditions where thunderstorms occur. For air showers under fair-weather conditions the intensity as well as the polarization of the radio emission can be understood rather accurately from the present models.\nFor air showers measured under thunderstorm conditions we observe large differences in the intensity and polarization patterns from the fair weather models. We will show that the linear as well as the circular polarization of the radio waves carry clear information on the orientation of the electric fields at different heights in the thunderstorm clouds. We will show for the first time that the circular polarization of the radio waves tells about the change of orientation of the fields with altitude. We will show that from the measured data at LOFAR the thunderstorm electric fields can be reconstructed.\nWe thus have established the measurement of radio emission from extensive air showers induced by cosmic rays as a new tool to probe the atmospheric electric fields present in thunderclouds in a non-intrusive way.",

            "abstract": "Ice Complex (IC) is the most well-known type of syncryogenic permafrost deposit. ICs are widely distributed in the northern-eastern part of Russia (Siberia) and in Alaska. These deposits are an important source of paleo-climatic information, because they contain well-preserved remains of flora and fauna typical for the time of preservation. The isotope signature of ice preserved in an IC can help to reconstruct specific features of the freezing period and freezing conditions. However, the best methods to use to determine the origin and age of ICs and what constitutes typical IC morphological structure are still being discussed. Conventionally, syncryogenic permafrost deposits of Pleistocene age, consisting of an ice-wedge net, are considered ICs. In our multi-year study, we applied a new approach, defining ICs using cryolithological criteria. Our results allow us to conclude that the initial composition of an IC is determined by the sediments (silt, sand, gravel) and processes (fluvial, slope, aeolian) involved in IC genesis. Further alteration of IC composition occurs via cryogenic processes during glacial epochs and partial/complete thawing during inter-glacial epochs; usually such alteration leads to an increase in the fine-grain fraction of IC sediments and the formation of separate IC layers, which should be considered as separate stratigraphic units. Only the uppermost unit of an IC should be called an edoma ice complex (EIC); this unit creates specific relief features, for which EICs are known, in Siberia and Yakutia. The most important task to which attention should be paid in further investigations is the development of criteria that will allow reconstructive modeling of the processes and conditions that existed in the past, processes and conditions which determined initial IC composition and alteration of properties over time.",

            "abstract": "The Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) bounds the Tibetan Plateau to the north and is the longest continental active strike-slip fault at lithospheric scale within the India-Eurasia collision zone (Wittlinger et al., 1998). Together with other mega strike-slip faults, e.g., the Kunlun, Haiyuan, Xianshuihe and Jiali faults, it plays an important role in both the two end member models, eastward block-like motion and distributed deformation or channel flow, to accommodate the India-Eurasia convergence. However, how much amount of northward motion, from convergence between Indian and Eurasian plates to the south, has been transferred by localized slip on the ATF into eastward motion of the Plateau relative to the Tarim basin is still unclear. Its main reason may be originated from disagreements over quite scattered Quaternary left-slip rates from 2 mm/yr up to 30 mm/yr and also difference in slip rate over time scales of 10 yr from GPS and InSAR to 10 kyr from Quaternary offset-landforms. However, accurate Quaternary long-term average slip rate is the first step for quantitatively evaluating the role of the ATF in transferring northward convergence of the India-Eurasia collision into eastward escape and then for understanding the kinematic model of the Tibetan Plateau.\nHere we present a synthetic approach to well constrain long-term left-slip rate by identifying paleo-earthquake sequence as precise chronologic bounds for the associated measured cumulative displacements at two sites on the Aksay segment of the ATF. This result is very important not only to establish surface-rupturing earthquake recurrence model to reduce its potential earthquake hazards along the ATF, but also to solve the long-standing dispute over the high or low Quaternary slip rates by using diferent terrace models and geodetic strain rate.\nAnalysis of the paleo-earthquakes from trenches and recent cumulative offsets reveals a Holocene surface-rupturing faulting process, which well constrains the long-term slip rate of the ATF on its eastern segment. These long-tern slip rates may help us to legitimately understand how much of the convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates has been accommodated by the ATF.",

            "abstract": "During a substorm event in 2009, THEMIS probes observed high-energy (≲ 1MeV) ions and characteristic time evolution of the differential flux. The high-energy ions seem to be produced in the magnetotail, but existing acceleration theories cannot explain the production of such high-energy ions due to the limitation of dawn-dusk (DD) flow scale. We propose that if two approaching flow fronts exist simultaneously in the magnetotail, the production of high-energy ions can be achieved. Namely, some ideal ions are repeatedly reflected by the two fronts and accelerated to high energies, exceeding the energy-limit given by the product of the duskward electric field and DD scale length of the flows. In addition, this acceleration model similar to “first-order Fermi acceleration” can produce the observed differential flux change.\nWe have analytically calculated the energy-gain of each ion between two approaching flow fronts, and roughly estimated the efficiency of the acceleration and the spectrum change. In order to include the DD flow scale, we have further performed a spatially 1-D (2-D in velocity) test particle simulation where a couple of flow fronts approach each other. Using the simulation, we have confirmed the production of high-energy ions as well as the change of the energy spectrum of ions associated with the acceleration. The simulation result shows that high-energy ions can be produced with shorter DD scale length compared to that of the simple acceleration for trapped particles in the flow front. If we assume that the DD scale length of the flow is 10Re, the simulated ion maximum energy near 1MeV and differential flux change are similar to those of the observation. This scale length is less than half of the length needed for the product with the duskward electric field to produce 1MeV ions. This estimated 10Re flow scale in that event does not contradict previous studies.",

            "abstract": "We characterized tsunamis from the 29 March and 5 May 2015 Kokopo, Papua New Guinea Mw 7.5 earthquake doublet by applying teleseismic body-wave inversion and tsunami simulation. These events are the first instrumentally-recorded tsunamis from the New Britain subduction zone. Seismic body-wave inversions using various rupture velocities (Vr) showed almost similar source-time functions and waveform agreements but the spatial distributions of the slips were different. In this study, the rupture velocities were reliably estimated from joint use of seismic and tsunami data for the earthquake doublet; and they (i.e., 1.75 and 1.5 km/s) were smaller than typical Vr values for tsunamigenic earthquakes. The largest slips on the fault were similar (2.1 m and 1.7 m), but the different depths and locations yielded maximum seafloor uplift of ~ 0.4 m and ~ 0.2 m, respectively, which resulted in different tsunami powers. This indicates that even though the earthquake size and rupture durations are similar for an earthquake doublet, the resultant tsunami would be different, depending on the location and depth of the earthquake source, as well as water depth around the source. Simulations of hypothetical tsunami scenarios with large magnitudes of Mw 8.4 and 8.5 from the New Britain subduction zone showed that the shoreline tide gauge zero-to-crest amplitude can reach up to 10 m in Rabaul.

            "abstract": "Since its arrival at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the instruments of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) have been collecting data on an ever growing plasma interaction region around the comet. During the first phase of the mission, this region was dominated by solar wind signatures interspersed with low-frequency magnetic field waves and ion deflection due to heavy cometary ion pick-up. However starting in March 2015, the plasma region became more active with magnetic field strengths around 40-50nT and a number of field discontinuities with ΔB~40nT. This study is aimed at two events in April and May 2015, where the discontinuities were accompanied by a marked change in ion and/or electron flow direction. We propose that this is due to an inhomogeneous composition of the coma that leads to different magnetic field regions, which are triggered by the solar wind, containing different particle populations. These different populations are either the result of a high neutral density or a heightened ionization rate upstream of the spacecraft. In this multi-instrument study we also investigate the influence of charged dust grains, which might influence the electron density.",

            "abstract": "In most cases, mountain glaciers are narrow and situated over steep slopes. A laser-based altimeter such as ICESat has a small illuminated footprint at about 70 m, thus allowing to measure precise elevations over narrow mountain glaciers. However, unlike a typical radar altimeter mission, ICESat does not have repeat ground tracks (except in its early phase) to measure heights of a specific point at different times. Within a time span, usually a reference digital elevation model is used to compute height anomalies at ICESat’s measurement sites over a designated area, which are then averaged to produce a representative height change (anomaly) in this area. In contrast, a radar altimeter such as TOPEX/Poseidon (TP; its follow-on missions are Jason-1 and -2), repeats its ground tracks at an even time interval (10 days for TP), but has a larger illuminated footprint than ICESat’s (about 1 km or larger), making it difficult to measure precise elevations over narrow mountain glaciers. Here we demonstrate the potential of TP and Jason-2 radar altimeters in detecting elevation changes over mountain glaciers that are sufficiently wide and smooth. We select several glacier-covered sites in Mt. Tanggula (Tibet) and the Himalayas to experiment with methods that can generate precise height measurements from the two altimeters. Over the same spot, ranging errors due to slope, volume scattering and radar penetration can be common between repeat cycles, and may be reduced by differencing successive heights. We retracked radar waveforms and classify the surfaces using the SRTM-derived elevations. The effects of terrain and slope are reduced by fitting a surface to the height measurements from repeat cycles. We remove outlier heights and apply a smoothing filter to form final time series of glacier elevation change at the selected sites, which are compared with the results from ICESat (note the different mission times). Because TP and Jason-2 measure height changes every 10 days, clear annual and inter-annual oscillations of glacier heights are present in the resulting time series, in comparison to the unevenly sampled height changes from ICESat that do not show such oscillations. The rates of glacier elevation change from T/P and Jason-2 are mostly negative, but vary with locations and heights.",

Interpretation of sedimentological paleointensity records is complicated, and volcanic rocks provide only non-continuous records. Another means for reconstructing paleomagnetic intensity is analyzing cosmogenic radio nuclides. In this study, we reconstruct the Blake and the Post-Blake Excursions using the cosmogenic radio nuclide 10Be in the Dome Fuji ice core. It has been reported that the Blake Excursion and the Post-Blake Excursion occurred within the Brunhes Chron, at around 115 ka and 100 ka, respectively. These two excursions occurred in quick succession. The Post-Blake Excursion is relatively poorly studied, only being reconstructed from sediments and volcanic rocks. Results indicate there is a significant peaks in 10Be flux that is thought to be reflect respectively the Blake and the Post-Blake Excursions. The maximum 10Be flux during the Post-Blake Excurison is similar to that of the Blake Excursion, suggesting that the geomagnetic dipole field during the Post-Blake Excursion weakened by the same amount as during the Blake Excursion. We also compare the results for the Laschamp Excursion that we also reconstructed from the same ice core to discuss the nature of individual excursions inferred from the cosmogenic radio nuclides data.",

            "abstract": "A key component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle is evapotranspiration (ET), which links the water, energy and carbon cycles, and returns about two-thirds of precipitation to the atmosphere. Understanding the variability of ET is a key factor in climate change, playing a central role in the potential acceleration of the water cycle under global warming, providing feedbacks between the land and atmosphere, and mitigating and exacerbating extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. Despite its importance our knowledge of ET variations and its controls is limited. These controls can be separated into atmospheric demand (radiative and aerodynamic controls) and surface limitations (environmental and ecophysical controls). Much of the uncertainty in ET derives from uncertainties in changes in atmospheric evaporative demand, often characterized by potential evapotranspiration (PET), which combines the effects of available radiation for evaporation and the ability of the atmosphere to accept evaporated water. This is particularly important in energy-limited regions, such as high latitudes and the humid tropics, where water availability is not limiting and changes in available radiation and temperature are key drivers.\nTo better understand changes and controls on atmospheric demand, we have developed an updated global dataset of surface meteorology and radiation for the past 70 years that merges reanalysis, satellite retrievals and station data. The reanalysis/satellite data are corrected locally (for biases and spurious trends) by assimilating data records for thousands of surface meteorology stations, and hundreds of surface radiation stations. The dataset is used to calculate long-term estimates of PET that show a general increase globally over the past 30-40 years. We decompose the variations in PET into components driven by radiative and aerodynamic controls. Although the spatial distribution of controls on PET changes is complex, temperature plays a major role overall in driving increases in PET globally. Humidity and windspeed are associated with changes in PET in some regions, although these are more uncertain because of data uncertainties. We discuss the implications of these variations and their controls on water availability and drought over the past decades and under future climates.",

            "abstract": "We propose here a massive cross-correlation technique applied to seismic events located around volcanoes and recorded at teleseismic distance. Multichannel cross-correlations are performed between 2002 to 2012 using seismic templates occurring at the time of moderate to large volcanic eruptions. The volcanic periods are reported from the Global Volcanism Program database while the waveform data are obtained from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The temporal distribution of new seismic events, built from the association of teleseismic detections reveals acceleration patterns, which are highly correlated to the past eruptive activities. These newly detected events are relocated using Bayesian approach and leads to preliminary interpretation of the volcanic plumbing system. Two examples are presented. First, the large 2008 eruption (Volcanic Explosivity Index, VEI4) of Kasatochi (Aleutian Islands, 52.10°N/175.31°W) is used to demonstrate that only few seismic templates (~3) help to reveal the time scale of the eruption. Results are compared to hydroacoustic signal, which is highly correlated to the distribution of new seismic events prior and during eruption. We also show that after the peaked seismic activity (i.e., ~ 100 seismic events in 1 hour) the infrasound signal starts and signs the volcanic plume activity. The second case example reveals with success seven past volcanic eruptions of lower magnitude (VEI1 to VEI2) of the Karangetang volcano (Siau Island in Indonesia, 2.46°N/125.24°E). We show the potential of this method to detect volcanic eruptions in isolated areas. This is of special interest especially when there is no volcano observatory to monitor the volcanic activity, or when the last eruptive period is unknown.",

            "abstract": "The study of instabilities in fluids in which viscosity experiences a transition at a certain temperature range is of great interest for the understanding of planetary interiors, since this phenomena is suitable for representing a very viscous lithosphere (and thus rather rigid) over a convecting mantle. To this end, we study a 2D convection problem in which viscosity depends on temperature by abruptly changing its value within a narrow temperature gap. Notable solutions are found for a sharp transition viscosity law which are fundamentally related to the presence of a symmetry in the problem. For instance, cyclic series are found consisting of spontaneous plate-like behaviors emerging sporadically through abrupt bursts, and rapidly evolving towards a stagnant lid regime. The plate-like evolution alternates motions towards either right or left, introducing temporary asymmetries on the convecting styles. Further time-dependent regimes with stagnant and plate-like lids are described, which are also greatly influenced by the presence of the symmetry. These results provide convection examples of moving plates, that coexist with subsurface upwards and downwards meandering jets, but without a proper subduction, and can be particularly illustrative for understanding convective styles of the Earth prior to subduction, or that of other planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "Here, we investigate the contribution of mesoscale eddies on the oxygen variability of the eastern tropical south Pacific, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. The contribution of mesoscale eddies is uncovered under a sensitivity experiments, in which an idealized simulation without mesoscale dynamics is compared to a realistic simulation. We found that eddy dynamics intensified the ventilation of both equatorial and oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) core regions of the eastern tropical south Pacific ocean. This increased ventilation was related to the intensified eastward and poleward transport of well oxygenated waters. At the equatorial region, the increased oxygen supply reduced the volume of hypoxic waters in the upper 500 m depth. This reduction of hypoxic waters volume was accompanied by an increase of oxygen content. In contrast, the eddy-driven oxygen supply to the core of the OMZ did not result in a reduction of hypoxic waters volume. The oxygen content in the water column showed reduced concentration. This reduction of oxygen content was related to the eddy-induced shallowing of the thermocline, which have contributed to the upward expansion of low oxygen waters, and increased oxygen consumption by increasing the export production. Our results suggest an influence of eddy variability on the observed interannual oxygen variability along the Peruvian coast. The intense eddy activity during El Niño events might have contributed to the increased oxygen content along the coast. During La Niña events, the weak eddy activity might not have favoured the oxygen increase, therefore the reduction of water column oxygen content.",

The objective of this study is to conduct statistical diagnosis of permafrost temperatures using soil temperature records from hydrometeorological stations across Russia. Based on soil temperature data from 26 hydrometeorological stations, we evaluate the changes in permafrost temperatures from 1961 through 2013 and their response to changes in air temperatures and seasonal snow depth. Soil temperatures from 26 stations show a significant increase at all depths with trend ranging from 0.35°C per decade at 20 cm depth to 0.23 °C per decade at 320 cm depth which is more than twice the rate of air temperature increase in the region. Enhanced soil temperature increase was found during cold seasons while no significant trends can be found during warm seasons. Permafrost temperature at 320 cm remains a significant and stable increase in each month. Besides the influence of air temperature, seasonal snow cover also played an important role in ground thermal dynamics. Considering changes both in seasonal snow depth and air temperature can explain much of the variance of soil temperature. This study further demonstrates that climate change signals inferred from permafrost temperatures are complicated by changes in seasonal snow cover.",

            "abstract": "Although Pleistocene and earlier aeolian sediments in the adjacent regions of deserts were used as indicators for the occurrence of the deserts in northern China, our multidisciplinary investigation in the Hunshandake Sandy Lands, Inner Mongolia, a typical landscape in the eastern portion of the Asian mid-latitude desert belt, demonstrates that this sandy desert is just ca. 4000 years old. Before the formation of the current sand dunes, Hunshandke was characterized with large and deep lakes and grasssland vegetation, as many sedimentary sections indicate. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology shows that the three large former lakes where we have done detailed investigation, experienced high stands from early Holocene to ca. 5 ka. During the early and middle Holocene this desert was a temperate steppe environment, dominated by grasslands and trees near lakes and streams, as various palaeoenvironmental proxies suggest. While North Hemisphere’s monsoonal regions experienced catastrophic precipitation decreases at ca. 4.2 ka, many parts of the presently arid and semi-arid zone in northern China were shifted from Green to Desert state. In the eastern portion of the Hunshandake, the desertification was, however, directly associated with groundwater capture by the Xilamulun River, as the palaeo-drainage remains show. The process of groundwater sapping initiated a sudden and irreversible region-wide hydrologic event that lowered the groundwater table and exacerbated the desertification of the Hunshandake, and further resulting in post-Humid period mass migration of northern China’s Hongshan culture from that we think the modern Chinese civilization has been rooted.",

A long-term records of N2O mixing ratios at both stations (2012-2014) provide the necessary statistics and temporal patterns. To achieve that purpose, a modeling framework has been established that utilizes the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Model (STILT), driven by the meteorological fields from the Integrated Forecasting System and coupled to the IER hourly emission database.. The framework allowed spatial source apportionment of the nitrous oxide loads measured at both stations. The influences of the most important regional sources of N2O have been analyzed, including Krakow agglomeration (waste, transport and power production) and chemical plant (nitric acid and caprolactam production), located ca. 100 km east of Krakow. The relative enhancement of these sources were analyzed against the reference scenario (all available European emission sources) and against the regional total.\nThe results have shown significant differences in the station characteristics, with very small enhancements of N2O concentrations predicted for Kasprowy Wierch (maximum 2 ppb). For Kraków, the predicted concentrations were higher (close to 2 ppb monthly median). Influence of the sources located in Małopolska have been shown to be in the range of 20% - 80% with a temporal variability on daily and seasonal scales.\n The predictions of the model were validated against in-situ observations performed at both stations, pointing to possible misattribution of the local sources in Kraków.",

Among several mitigation methods proposed to reduce the H2S emissions, is H2S sequestration into geothermal systems. Reykjavík Energy is undertaking a pilot project at Hellisheidi geothermal system (SW Iceland) called Sulfix project where H2S is being injected into the geothermal reservoir for permanent sequestration into pyrite. The SulFix project started its operation in June 2014: the soluble geothermal gases are dissolved in geothermal waste water, and injected at 8 bars into the high temperature reservoir (>200˚C) at 750 m below the wellhead. The reactions involving sulfur in the geothermal reservoir may be traced using sulfur fluid chemistry and multiple sulfur isotope systematics (32S, 33S, 34S and 36S), including mixing between the reservoir geothermal fluid and the injection fluid, sulfide mineralization and oxidation of sulfide to sulfate.\nIn this study we investigated the multiple sulfur isotope systematics upon sulfide mineralization under geothermal conditions. High temperature flow through experiments were carried out in basaltic glass at 200-250°C and ~5 mmol/kg H2S to study the fluid-rock interaction. The results indicate that the sulfide mineralization occurs rapidly under geothermal conditions, highlighting the leaching rate of iron from the basaltic glass as the mineralization rate determining factor. Moreover, the formation of sulfide may be traced using the δ34S-Δ33S relationship in the fluids and pyrite formation - for example to determine if non-reactive mixing between the injection fluids and reservoir fluids occurs at Hellisheidi.

The data processing methods adopted are Pre-processing (Geometric correction and Radiometric calibration), Speckle Reduction, Image Decomposition and Image Classification. Initially to classify forest regions, unsupervised classification was applied to determine different unknown classes. It was observed K-means clustering method gave better results in comparison with ISO Data method.Using the algorithm developed for Radar Tools, the code for decomposition and classification techniques were applied in Interactive Data Language (IDL) and was applied to RISAT-1 image of Mysore-Mandya region of Karnataka, India. This region is chosen for studying forest vegetation and consists of agricultural lands, water and hilly regions. Polarimetric SAR data possess a high potential for classification of earth surface.\nAfter applying the decomposition techniques, classification was done by selecting region of interests andpost-classification the over-all accuracy was observed to be higher in the SDH decomposed image, as it operates on individual pixels on a coherent basis and utilises the complete intrinsic coherent nature of polarimetric SAR data. Thereby, making SDH decomposition particularly suited for analysis of high-resolution SAR data. The Pauli Decomposition represents all the polarimetric information in a single SAR image however interpretation of the resulting image is difficult. The SDH decomposition technique seems to produce better results and interpretation as compared to Pauli Decomposition however more quantification and further analysis are being done in this area of research. The comparison of Polarimetric decomposition techniques and evolutionary classification techniques will be the scope of this work.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing acquisition of high-precision surface pressure data in Gale crater by the MSL meteorology package motivates our investigation of how to interpret the observed diurnal variations in surface pressure in terms of seasonal changes in planetary-scale thermal forcing. We utilize a very high resolution Mars global circulation model (15 and 7.5 km resolution) that simulates diurnal variabilty at scales ranging from the crater scale to the planetary scale to address the issue of distinguishing the pressure signature of small-scale topographically-driven circulations from the global tide field. We define the latter as that resulting from a resynthesis of surface pressure using a compact set of tide modes derived from a space-time analysis of suitably normalized simulated surface pressure. This field includes the migrating tides, resonantly enhanced Kelvin waves and a small set of additional nonmigrating tides. The resulting residual pressure field is found to be highly localized and clearly influenced by topography. In particular, there are enhancements in the diurnal period tide amplitude of ~ 8-15 Pa in the majority of “small” scale craters. The enhancement in Gale crater is very similar to that found in a mesoscale model study by Tyler and Barnes [2013]. The phasing of the peak residual diurnal tide amplitude is invariably 6-8 am local solar time (LST) and is due to nighttime downlope/daytime upslope circulations. Slope wind effects are not simply localized to craters, but impact larger basin-like regions as well, including Hellas, Argyre, Isidis, and Solis Planum.\nA notable feature of the MSL pressure record is the seasonally-evolving appearance of sharply peaked features at 0800 and 2000 LST that reflect the presence of four and six hour harmonics. We find that these modes correspond to migrating (sun-synchronous) tides and the observed seasonal cycle can be well matched by models with suitably evolving radiative forcing by aerosols. In short, these tide modes reflect global-scale forcing. We will discuss how consideration of these higher frequency tides aids modelers in assessing the impact of radiatively active water ice clouds.",

            "abstract": "Most studies on convection in the Earth's mantle and core employ the Boussinesq approximation, which assumes an incompressible mantle. However, convection in the Earth's interior is subjected to compressible effects due to increase of density with depth. They are the cause of the so-called Adiabatic (or isentropic) gradient, which plays an important role in the core where conduction along the adiabat can transfer a large fraction of the total heat extracted, and may even potentially generate stagnant layers of pure conduction. We developed a numerical method for a fully compressible convection model, which may later be reduced to the different simplifications such as the anelastic approximation and the anelastic liquid approximation. The tests of our numerical schemes against selfconsistent criteria show that the numerical simulations are fully consistent from the point of view of energy dissipation, heat transfer and entropy budget. We analyze the solutions of this thermal convection problem with different equations of state in a wide range of dimensionless parameters and determine the domain of validity of each approximation.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayas were recently identified as a global hotspot for deep stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) during spring [1]. Although STT transport in this region may play a vital role in tropospheric chemistry, the hydrological cycle and aquatic ecosystems in Asia, there is no direct measurement of a specific chemical stratospheric tracer to verify and evaluate its possible impact. Here, cosmogenic 35S tracer (half-life: ~87 days) produced in the stratosphere was measured for the first time in surface snow and river runoff samples collected at Mt. Everest in April 2013 using a low-noise liquid scintillation spectroscopy [2]. Strikingly, we find extraordinarily high concentrations of 35S in these samples (>10 times higher than the southern Tibetan Plateau), verifying the Himalayas as a gateway of springtime STT. In light of this, two studies were conducted: a) Measurements of 35SO2 and 35SO42- at the southern Tibetan Plateau reveals that the oxidative life time of SO2 is reduced to 2.1 days under the influence of aged stratospheric air masses from the Himalayas. A concept box model for estimating the influence of STT on surface O3 using 35S tracer is proposed. b) Quadruple stable sulfur isotopes in a sediment core (~250 years) from the Gokyo Lake (the world’s highest freshwater lake) [3] near Mt. Everest are being measured to investigate the possible impact of STT on sulfur budget at the Himalayas. The absence of sulfide suggests that bacterial sulfate reduction may be negligible in this lake. Enrichment of uranium (EF ≈ 10) in 20th century samples highlights the impact of atmospheric deposition. S-isotope sulfate anomalies are not found (∆33S and ∆36S ≈ 0‰), implying that sulfate in this lake may be mainly contributed by eolian dust or derived from rock. This is also supported by the low enrichments of most trace elements (EF ≈ 1). Rare earth elements will be used to assist in identifying the potential sources and interpreting the variation of δ34S. To better resolve the impacts of STT on sulfur cycle, sulfur isotope measurements in aerosols or ice cores collected at Mt. Everest in the future are recommended.\n",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremors are observed worldwide and most in the hot young subduction zones. However, recent studies reported that tremors and slow slips (SSEs) occur in the Japan subduction zone which is rather cold or old subduction (Kato et al., 2012; Ito et al., 2015). Ito et al. (2015) showed the coincidental excitations of the tremors and the SSE before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake by examining the ambient noise level in the ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) records. However, the previous method is only based on amplitudes. In this study, we examine polarization and envelope amplitudes in different frequency bands of OBS data for validation and further detection of tremors beneath the Japan subduction zone.\nThe average particle motion polarization for every 10-minute time window is calculated on the basis of the three-component covariance matrix of ground motion. The degree of linearity and the polarization azimuth are measured from the ratio among three eigenvalues and the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, respectively (Jurkevicks, 1988; Wech et al., 2007). We apply the method to the continuous velocity seismograms for 5 months from November 2010 to March 2011 recorded at 17 short-period OBS network stations deployed in the Japan Trench axis area off Miyagi, northeast Japan.\nThe polarization results show three major tremor sequences which correspond to the tremor sequences reported in Ito et al. (2015) and several minor tremor sequences. The stable and nearly constant polarization azimuths in these sequences indicate similar focal mechanisms and epicenters. The azimuths slightly change toward the largest foreshock of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, which may possibly indicate the migration of tremor sources. To validate these tremor signals, we apply another detection method based on the frequency scanning detection at a single station (Sit et al., 2012). For a given time window, the ratios among the averaged amplitudes of three bandpass filtered envelope waveforms from 2-4 Hz, 10-20 Hz and 0.5-1.0 Hz (tremor, local earthquakes and ocean noises) are used to distinguish tremor signals from other noises. The preliminary result shows good correlation with the result from Ito et al. (2015) and the polarization analysis, which strongly support the occurrence of tremors in the Japan subduction area.",

However, very little is known about this property at the extreme conditions of pressure and temperature that prevailed in the magma ocean. We have computed from first principles molecular dynamics simulations the dc conductivity of liquid Silica SiO2 at pressure and temperature conditions spanning those of the magma ocean and super-Earth interiors. We find semi-metallic values of the conductivity at conditions typical of the putative basal magma ocean in the Early Earth. The variation of the conductivity with pressure and temperature displays interesting behavior that we rationalize on the basis of the closing the pseudo-gap at the Fermi level. For temperatures lower than T < 20,000 K electrical conductivity exhibits a maximum at intermediate compressions. We further explain this behavior in terms of stuctural changes that occur in silica liquid at high pressure; we find that the structure approaches that of the iso-electronic rare earth element Ne. We compare with Hugoniot data, including the equation of state, heat capacity, and reflectivity. The behavior of the heat capacity is different to that inferred from multiple Hugoniot experiments. These differences and the effect of including exact exchange on the calculations are discussed. Our results have important consequences for magnetic field generation in the early Earth and super-Earths.",

Our study introduces a novel approach for inferring uncertainty-quantified hydrological and thermal parameters from a combination of pressure and temperature measurements in the hyporheic zone (HZ).\nWe use a stochastic approach to infer thermal and hydrological parameters in a HZ vertical profile. The column is forced by pressure and temperature time series at the boundaries and conditioned on temperature at multiple depths. The inversion process is based on a Bayesian algorithm called Method of Anchored Distribution (MAD) and on the associated open-source program MAD++, with extensions in the post-processing toolbox. This approach has several benefits. First, the hierarchical framework built-in in MAD allows the specification of a non-parametric and assumption-free likelihood function. Moreover, the Bayesian approach yields data-driven and naturally uncertainty-quantified parameter estimates.\nWe present two outcomes of the inversion approach. (1) Repeating the analysis at multiple locations yields spatially-distributed snapshots of uncertainty-quantified HZ parameters. (2) The unconditional posterior distribution of hydrological parameters is integrated in a Monte-Carlo error estimation framework to provide statistical distributions of surface-subsurface exchanges time series.\nWe present the methodology and demonstrate its application using field measurements from the Avenelles basin, France.",

            "abstract": "As the shape of the Greenland ice sheet responds to changes in surface mass balance (SMB) and dynamics, it affects the surface mass balance through the atmospheric lapse rate and by altering atmospheric circulation patterns. Positive degree day models include simplified representations of this feedback, but it is difficult to simulate with state-of-the-art models because it requires coupling of regional climate models with dynamical ice sheet models, which is technically challenging. This difficulty, along with the high computational expense of regional climate models, also drastically limits opportunities for exploring the impact of modelling uncertainties on sea level projections.\nWe present a parameterisation of the SMB-elevation feedback in the MAR regional climate model that provides a far easier and quicker estimate than atmosphere-ice sheet model coupling, which can be used with any ice sheet model. This allows us to use ensembles of different parameter values and ice sheet models to assess the effect of uncertainty in the feedback and ice sheet model structure on future sea level projections.\nWe take a Bayesian approach to uncertainty in the feedback parameterisation, scoring the results from multiple possible \"SMB lapse rates\" according to how well they reproduce a MAR simulation with altered ice sheet topography. We test the impact of the resulting parameterisation on sea level projections using five ice sheet models forced by MAR (in turned forced by two different global climate models) under the emissions scenario A1B. The estimated additional sea level contribution due to the SMB–elevation feedback is 4.3% at 2100 (95% credibility interval 1.8–6.9%), and 9.6% at 2200 (3.6–16.0%).",

            "abstract": "After the 2011 devastating Tohoku tsunami, improvement of tsunami early warning system is one of key issues in Japan. Japanese government was decided to install 125 ocean bottom pressure sensors and seismometers with a cable system along the Japan and Kurile trench. Each sensor is separated by 30km. We should develop a new approach for real-time tsunami forecast using those newly available data combined with GNSS data or seismic data.  A well-recognized problem to use tsunami data at pressure sensors on the top of tsunami source area is a fact that a large vertical coseismic deformation due to a large earthquake cannot be observed at those sensors. The sensors observe a tsunami wave when it starts to propagate. Because of that problem, GSNN data or seismic data are typically used to estimate the coseismic deformation for the tsunami numerical simulation. In this paper, we develop a new technique, which solve the problem. Our technique uses the observations at pressure sensors on the tsunami source area as an input to compute the tsunami directly. Actual tsunami heights at the sensors on the source area is unknown because the cosismic vertical deformation is unknown. However, we can observe directly the time derivative of tsunami heights at those sensors. Time derivatives of tsunami heights at each point are used as inputs to compute the tsunami height distribution in the calculated area. Then we can numerically compute a tsunami using a traditional finite difference technique from the tsunami height distribution computed. For numerical test, first, we compute the synthetic tsunamis using the fault model with 1 minute grid system. The computed tsunami waveforms at 15 minutes x 15 minutes grid points are used as the observed data for this new technique. Each observed point is separated by 15 minutes, about 30km. The result show that the accuracy of tsunami computation is good enough for tsunami forecast. Tsunami generation with a long duration, such as tsunami earthquake, is also tested for this technique. The results are also good enough for tsunami forecast. Without information of an earthquake, tsunami can be computed from observed tsunami data near the source area using this new technique. The technique is useful for a tsunami early warning system. It is important to be combined with other approaches using other data such as GSNN data.",

Currently many operational LST products have been generated using European and American satellite data, i.e., the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, few LST product has been produced using Chinese satellite data. Thus, the objective of this study is to generate reliable LST product using Chinese HJ-1B satellite data.\nThe HJ-1B satellite of China, were launched on September 6, 2008, which are used for disaster and environment monitoring. IRS (Infrared Scanner) is one of the key instruments onboard HJ-1B satellite, it can scan the earth every four days, has four spectral bands ranging from the near-infrared to thermal infrared bands (band 1 0.75 - 1.10μm, band 2 1.55-1.75μm, MIR band 3 3.50 - 3.90μm, band 4 10.5-12.5μm) with 720 km swath. It scans ±29° from nadir and the spatial resolution for band1-3 is 150m and 300m for band4.\nIn this study, a single-channel parametric model (SC-PM) algorithm were used to produce 300m LST product from HJ-1B IRS data. The NCEP atmospheric profiles and a parametric model were used for atmospheric correction. In order to improve the accuracy of the land surface emissivity (LSE), the 1km ASTER Global Emissivity Database (GED) and self-developed 5-day 1km vegetation cover product were used for estimating the LSE based on the Vegetation Cover Method. Two years of HJ-1B IRS LST product in Heihe River basin (Gansu province, China) from June 2012 to June 2014 were generated. The LST products were evaluated against ground observations in an arid area of northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment. Four barren surface sites and ten vegetated sites were chosen for the evaluation. The results show that the developed HJ-1B IRS LST products demonstrate a good accuracy, with an average bias of 0.11 K and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.43 K for all the sites during daytime. In addition, the biases are within 1K for all the barren surface sites, this indicate that using ASTER GED can produce reliable LST products from HJ-1B IRS data, especially for the barren surfaces.",

            "abstract": "The term “curse of dimensionality” refers to increases in the dimensionality of model spaces that result in undesirable increases in data sparsity, such that model parameters are no longer sufficiently constrained by the data. It is relevant for many problems in exploration geophysics. The most obvious applications are 3D tomographic inversions, which typically include very large numbers of unknowns.   There is a further “curse of dimensionality” that may impede many geophysical investigations: 3D surveys typically involve the acquisition of data using only a 2D array of sensors distributed across the Earth’s surface. As a consequence, procedures for imaging the subsurface are missing data recorded in the third dimension, depth. Similar problems affect 2D inversions of (1D) profile data.   Computational problems that need to be overcome in large-scale tomographic inversions are additional issues associated with the “curse of dimensionality”. In particular, the rapidly emerging field of realistic 3D full-waveform inversions of elastic and anisotroic data is hitting the limits of current computer facilities. Seemingly ever increasing computing power will undoubtedly be beneficial for such endeavors. Nevertheless, suitable model parameterizations that offer appropriate spatial resolution while keeping the inversion problem computationally tractable will continue to be critical elements of any high dimension inversion endeavor.   Because of the large computational costs and the difficulties to cover extensive areas with geophysical sensors in complicated terrain, many land surveys continue to involve data acquisition along profiles. Such surveys will play a significant role for the foreseeable future. When solving the associated 2D inversion problems, the “curse of dimensionality” strikes again. The underlying 2D assumption that subsurface properties and topography do not change in the third dimension, that is, perpendicular to the tomographic plane, is often unjustified.\nIn this presentation, the “curse of dimensionality” will be illustrated by means of several examples from near-surface geophysics. A variety of options will be presented for addressing the related problems, including experimental design techniques and optimized model parameterization strategies.",

            "abstract": "Microrelief formations (“gilgai”), which form due to successive wetting-drying cycles typical of swelling soils, provide ecological hotspots for local fauna and flora, including higher and more robust vegetative growth. The distribution of these gilgai suggests a remarkable degree of regularity. However, it is unclear to what extent the mechanisms that drive gilgai formation are physical, such as desiccation-induced fracturing, or biological in nature, namely antecedent vegetative clustering. We investigated gilgai genesis and pattern formation in a 100 x 100 meter study area with swelling soils in a semiarid grassland at the Mpala Research Center in central Kenya. Our ongoing experiment is composed of three 9m2 treatments: we removed gilgai and limited vegetative growth by herbicide application in one plot, allowed for unrestricted seed dispersal in another, and left gilgai unobstructed in a control plot. To estimate the spatial frequencies of the repeating patterns of gilgai, we obtained ultra-high resolution (0.01-0.03m/pixel) images with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from which digital elevation models were also generated. Geostatistical analyses using wavelet and fourier methods in 1- and 2-dimensions were employed to characterize gilgai size and distribution. Preliminary results support regular spatial patterning across the gilgaied landscape and heterogeneities may be related to local soil properties and biophysical influences. Local data on gilgai and fracture characteristics suggest that gilgai form at characteristic heights and spacing based on fracture morphology: deep, wide cracks result in large, highly vegetated mounds whereas shallow cracks, induced by animal trails, are less correlated with gilgai size and shape. Our experiments will help elucidate the links between shrink-swell processes and gilgai-vegetation patterning in high activity clay soils and advance our understanding of the mechanisms of gilgai formation in drylands.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of amendment of different biochars on soil physical and biological properties as well as soil carbon sequestration. Biochars were produced with dairy manure and woodchip at temperatures of 300, 500, and 700°C, respectively. Each biochar was mixed at 5% (w/w) with a forest soil and the mixture was incubated for 180 days, during which soil physical and biological properties, and soil respiration rates were measured. Results showed that the biochar addition significantly enhanced the formation of soil macroaggregates at the early incubation time. The biochar application significantly reduced soil bulk density, increased the amount of soil organic matter, and stimulated microbial activity and soil respiration rates at the early incubation stage. Biochar applications improved water retention capacity, with stronger effects by biochars produced at higher pyrolysis temperatures. At the same suction, the soil with woodchip biochars possessed higher water content than with the dairy manure biochars. Biochar addition significantly affected the soil physical and biological properties, which resulted in different soil carbon mineralization rates and the amount of soil carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "Flows in fractured and deformable media are difficult to characterize and predict, and this is especially so for multiphase flows where interactions at interfaces between gas, liquid and granular phases contribute to the fluid dynamics. Here we study gas driven (pneumatic) fracturing of a wet unconsolidated granular packing confined in a Hele-Shaw cell, and present an in-depth analysis of both pore-scale phenomena and large scale pattern formation. The fracture growth process is governed by a complex interplay between pressure, capillary, frictional and viscous forces. Fractures are observed to grow in an intermittent, stick slip fashion, punctuated by stationary periods. Growth is impeded by friction from local compaction fronts forming around the growing fracture branches, and new fractures are triggered by initial pore invasion followed by fluidization of the compaction front. We study the influence of granular properties (size/shape) as well as gas injection rate, and find that the system undergoes a series of transitions in terms of observed dynamics and pattern formation. We propose simple mathematical models that predict fracture density from basic properties of the deformable granular packing, and also a transition from fracturing to fluidization and viscous fingering beyond a critical injection rate.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall is the main driver of hydrological systems. Unfortunately, it is highly variable in space and time and therefore difficult to observe accurately. This poses a serious challenge to correctly estimate the catchment-averaged precipitation, a key factor for hydrological models. As biased precipitation leads to biased parameter estimation and thus to biased runoff predictions, it is very important to have a realistic description of precipitation uncertainty. Rainfall multipliers (RM), which correct each observed storm with a random factor, provide a first step into this direction. Nevertheless, they often fail when the estimated input has a different temporal pattern from the true one or when a storm is not detected by the raingauge. In this study we propose a more realistic input error model, which is able to overcome these challenges and increase our certainty by better estimating model input and parameters. We formulate the average precipitation over the watershed as a stochastic input process (SIP). We suggest a transformed Gauss-Markov process, which is estimated in a Bayesian framework by using input (rainfall) and output (runoff) data. We tested the methodology in a 28.6 ha urban catchment represented by an accurate conceptual model. Specifically, we perform calibration and predictions with SIP and RM using accurate data from nearby raingauges (R1) and inaccurate data from a distant gauge (R2). Results show that using SIP, the estimated model parameters are \"protected\" from the corrupting impact of inaccurate rainfall. Additionally, SIP can correct input biases during calibration (Figure) and reliably quantify rainfall and runoff uncertainties during both calibration (Figure) and validation. In our real-word application with non-trivial rainfall errors, this was not the case with RM. We therefore recommend SIP in all cases where the input is the predominant source of uncertainty. Furthermore, the high-resolution rainfall intensities obtained with this innovative technique can help validate areal rainfall estimates from other methods and constitute an important contribution towards separating predictive uncertainties.",

According to earlier studies using data of low time resolution, the SI and HCS get closer further away from the Sun, and the two structures coincide with each other around 5 AU. In this study, we make use of the STEREO data of a much higher time resolution to reveal the relative location of the SI, HCS, and the so-called True Sector Boundary (TSB) that is given by the boundary at which the suprathermal electrons change their relative propagating directions. We find the SI coincides with the HCS while the TSB is found at a distinct location. Preliminary analysis suggests that the closed loops in pseudostreamer continually have interchange reconnection with the open field lines that lead them, resulting not only the coincidence of HCS and SI but also the separation of the TSB from the HCS/SI. We therefore conclude that the interchange reconnection plays an important role at the evolution of slow solar wind.",

Despite the tremendous progress in the theory, observation and prediction of El Niño over the past three decades, there is still considerable debate on the classification of El Niño diversity and on the genesis of such diversity. This uncertainty renders El Niño prediction a continuously challenging task. Here we provide a unified perspective on El Niño diversity as well as its causes, based on a fuzzy clustering analysis and model experiments. Specifically, the interannual variability of the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature can be generally classified into three warm patterns and one cold pattern, which together constitute a canonical El Niño/La Niña cycle and its different flavors. Whereas the genesis of the canonical cycle can be readily explained by classic theories, the asymmetry, irregularity and extremes of El Niño may well result from westerly wind bursts, a type of state-dependent atmospheric perturbation in the equatorial Pacific, which strongly affects El Niño but not La Niña due to its unidirectional nature. This suggests that properly accounting for the interplay between the canonical cycle and westerly wind bursts may improve El Niño prediction.",

            "abstract": "Forest management has the potential to impact surface physical characteristics to the same degree that changes in land cover do. The impacts of land cover changes on the global climate are well-known. Despite an increasingly detailed understanding of the potential for forest management to affect climate, none of the current generation of Earth system models account for forest management through their land surface modules. We addressed this gap by developing and reparameterizing the ORCHIDEE land surface model to simulate the biogeochemical and biophysical effects of forest management. Through vertical discretization of the forest canopy and corresponding modifications to the energy budget, radiation transfer, and carbon allocation, forest management can now be simulated much more realistically on the global scale. This model was used to explore the effect of forest management on European climate since 1750. Reparameterization was carried out to replace generic forest plant functional types with real tree species, covering the most dominant species across the continent. Historical forest management and land cover maps were created to run the simulations from 1600 until the present day. The model was coupled to the atmospheric model LMDz to explore differences in climate between 1750 and 2010 and attribute those differences to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and concurrent warming, land cover, species composition, and wood extraction. Although Europe's forest are considered a carbon sink in this century, our simulations show the modern forests are still experiencing carbon debt compared to their historical values.",

            "abstract": "Large pools of organic carbon were reported in The First State of the Carbon Cycle Report, but measurements from high latitude ecosystems, in particular for deeper soils >1m depth, remained scarce. A newly enlarged soil carbon database with an order of magnitude more numerous deep sampling sites has verified the widespread pattern of large quantities of carbon accumulated deep in permafrost (perennially frozen) soils. The known pool of permafrost carbon across the northern circumpolar permafrost zone is now estimated to be 1330-1580 Pg C, with the potential for an additional ~400 Pg C in deep permafrost sediments. In addition, an uncertainty estimate of plus/minus 15% has now been calculated for the soil carbon pool in the surface 0-3m. Laboratory incubations of these permafrost soils reveal that a significant fraction can be mineralized by microbes upon thaw and converted to carbon dioxide and methane on time scales of years to decades, with decade-long average losses from aerobic incubations ranging from 6-34% of initial carbon. Carbon emissions from the same soils incubated in an anaerobic environment are, on average, 78-85% lower than aerobic soils. But, the more potent greenhouse gas methane released under anaerobic conditions in part increases the climate impact of these emissions. While mean quantities of methane are only 3% to 7% that of carbon dioxide emitted from anaerobic incubations (by weight of C), these mean methane values represent 25% to 45% of the overall potential impact on climate when accounting for the higher global warming potential of methane. Taken together though, in spite of the more potent greenhouse gas methane, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier, aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment. Model projections tend to estimate losses of carbon in line with empirical measurements, but differ in the extent that they project that soil carbon loss will be compensated by new plant growth and carbon input to the surface soil. Together, the loss of carbon from thawing permafrost soils and disturbance by fire in combination with offsetting plant uptake response determines the net effect of high latitudes on the carbon cycle of both North America and the globe.",

            "abstract": "Measuring spectral dependence of light absorption by colored organic or “brown” carbon (BrC) is important, because of its effects on photolysis rates of ozone and surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Enhanced UV spectral absorption by BrC can in turn be exploited for simultaneous retrievals of BrC and black carbon (BC) column amounts in field campaigns. We present an innovative ground-based retrieval of BC and BrC volume fractions and their mass absorption efficiencies during the biomass burning season in Santa Cruz, Bolivia in September-October 2007. Our method combines retrieval of BC volume fraction using AERONET inversion in visible wavelengths with the inversion of total BC+BrC absorption (i.e., column effective imaginary refractive index, kmeas) using Diffuse/Direct irradiance measurements in UV wavelengths. First, we retrieve BrC volume fraction by fitting kmeas at 368nm using Maxwell-Garnett (MG) mixing rules assuming: (1) flat spectral dependence of kBC, (2) known value of kBrC at 368nm from laboratory absorption measurements or smoke chamber experiments, and (3) known BC volume fraction from AERONET inversion. Next, we derive kBrC in short UVB wavelengths by fitting kmeas at 305nm, 311nm, 317nm, 325nm, and 332nm using MG mixing rules and fixed volume fractions of BC and BrC. Our retrievals show larger than expected spectral dependence of kBrC in UVB wavelengths, implying reduced surface UVB irradiance and inhibited photolysis rates of surface ozone destruction. We use a one-dimensional chemical box model to show that the observed strong wavelength dependence of BrC absorption leads to inhibited photolysis of ozone to O(1D), a loss mechanism, while having little impact or even accelerating photolysis of NO2, an ozone production mechanism. Although BC only absorption in biomass burning aerosols is important for climate radiative forcing in the visible wavelengths, additional absorption by BrC is important because of its impact on surface UVB radiation affecting human health, ecosystem, photochemistry, and air quality.",

            "abstract": "The estimated magnitude of aerosol cloud mediated radiative forcing has evolved during the IPCC assessments, but its large uncertainty remained essentially unchanged and constituted a major component of the total uncertainty in climate forcing. In fact, paradoxically, the advancements in understanding impacts of cloud aerosol interactions on radiation increase the uncertainty, because we discover additional pathways by which aerosols affects clouds much faster than developing our ability to quantify these effects observationally. In other words, we discover more of what we should know that we don't know. This inherently increases the known uncertainty. The presentation will review the various known and recently discovered aerosol cloud mediated radiative effects and the methods that may be used to quantify them. The major challenges in doing so are measuring CCN from satellites and disentangling the impacts of CCN and updrafts on cloud properties. New breakthrough capabilities that give hope that it may be achievable from current satellite measurements will be presented.",

We have found that a focus on clean energy solutions, without reference to dirty energy, substantially reduces (may even eliminate) the negativity associated with sea level rise, extreme weather and other climate change presentations. US audiences respond well to discussion of California’s clean energy transformation with solar, wind, geothermal and water power together now approaching 25% of total energy supply for the world’s sixth largest economy.\nFor both policymakers and the general public, a “positive climate change” presentation does not generally suffice on its own. Clear visual display of climate science information is essential. We have found the Science On a Sphere (SOS) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration science education tool, to be exceptional in this regard. Further, broad dissemination is possible given the SOS network consists of over 120 sites in 23 countries. The new SOS Explorer system, an advanced science education tool, can readily utilize the over 500 available SOS data sets.\nWe have recently developed an arctic amplification and mid-latitude climate change impacts program for the upcoming US National Academy of Sciences’ Arctic Matters Symposium/Open House. This SOS and SOS Explorer education program will be described with emphasis on the climate solutions incorporated into this module targeted at US policymakers and invited open house public.",

            "abstract": "Observations at a rare, modern drumlin field—exposed by the recession of the Icelandic surge-type glacier, Múlajökull—allow a physically based model of drumlin formation to be formulated. These observations include the following: 1) drumlin relief resulted from basal till deposition on drumlins and erosion between them; 2) till deposition occurred during surges; 3) evidence of longitudinally compressive strain in till of the drumlins, as expected from negative flux divergence in a shearing bed, is absent; 4) during quiescent periods till was under higher effective normal stresses between drumlins than within them; 5) crevasse swarms are coincident with drumlins, and 6) water drainage at the glacier margin during the current quiescent state is through channels in low areas between drumlins.\nIn the new model, basal sediment transport is controlled by patterns of effective stress that are different in the quiescent and surging states. During quiescent periods, slip of ice over a sinusoidally perturbed bed, crevasse formation, and flow of subglacial water toward R-channels that lie between drumlins result in effective stresses that increase toward channels and decrease from the stoss to the lee sides of drumlins. This effective-stress pattern causes till entrainment and erosion by regelation infiltration (Rempel, 2008, JGR, 113) that peaks at drumlin heads and near R-channels and is minimized on the lee sides of drumlins, while bed shear is inhibited by effective stresses too high to allow deformation. In contrast, during surges regelation infiltration cannot occur, and high rates of bed shear—assumed to be spatially uniform due to the lack of evidence for till flux divergence—cause basal melt rates sufficient to deposit, by lodgment, till layers of up to ~2.0 m in thickness during a single surge. With multiple surge cycles, drumlins grow in height and migrate downglacier, with resultant stratigraphy in broad agreement with field observations.",

            "abstract": "During the substorm growth phase the overall convection, electric currents, and aurora structures in the nightside ionosphere often change very gradually over prolonged (> 1 hr) periods, and therefore the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) system can be considered to be in a quasi-steady state. For the source region of a downward field-aligned current (FAC) the cross-tail current, which is carried mostly by ions, closes with a FAC, which is carried by electrons moving away from the ionosphere. Thus both ions and electrons accumulate there and accordingly, the plasma pressure increases. In the source region of an upward FAC, in contrast, the reduction of plasma pressure is expected. Since the plasma pressure, more precisely the entropy parameter (pVr), is most critical for the interchange stability of the magnetotail, this simple assessment raises a fundamental question about the magnetotail dynamics, that is, how the magnetotail remains to be steady. In this study we argue that if the magnetosphere is in a steady state, those expected increase and decrease in plasma pressure need to balance with the change due to the plasma transport by convection. This requirement, along with the condition for the interchange stability, leads to the conclusion that the associated pattern of convection has a structure that is presumably the magnetospheric counter part of the Harang reversal. More specifically, for the dusk convection cell, the convection flow is directed azimuthally westward in the source region of the downward R2 current, whereas it is directed sunward in the source region of the upward R1 current. We verify this idea by examining a quasi-steady magnetotail modeled by the RCM-Dungey code. Using equi-potential contours as a reference we also suggest that auroral arcs mapped to the equator tend to be oriented in the east-west and Sun-Earth direction if they are located in the premidnight R2 and R1 currents, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The world economy is under pressure for greater, more efficient and more sustainable use of natural resources to meet complementary and competing objectives in the energy, water, and food sectors. Increasing national, regional, and seasonal water scarcities in much of the world pose severe challenges for national governments, the international development community, and ultimately, for individual water users. This presentation assesses the nexus between energy and water, with an emphasis on the interactions and trade-offs between energy and water for food production. It examines the impact of biofuel production on water quantity and quality, and the potential for hydropower potential to meet energy challenges while expanding irrigation water supplies and food production potential, thereby enhancing global food security.\nBiofuel production affects both water quantity and quality. Expanding production of biofuels—through either crop-based production systems or direct biomass production—can significantly increase demand for water as more acreage is planted or the crop mix begins to favor thirstier crops; water demand for bio-refineries creates additional competition with agricultural water use. Water quality can also be adversely affected by increased acreage for fertilizer-intensive crops, such as maize or sugarcane, which can result in increased nitrate run-off and soil erosion.\nHydropower has become a relatively forgotten part of the energy-water security picture that deserves renewed attention. Unlike biofuels, hydropower does not normally compete with agricultural water. Instead, development of hydropower could complement food production by developing dam structures and power that also provide irrigation water and support its distribution for growing food crops. But balanced hydropower policies require consideration of potential trade-offs with environmental and social impacts.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of groundwater recharge is important to evaluate aquifer’s water balance. Spatial and temporal distribution of the recharge depends on variability of hydraulic properties of rock. This variability is larger for sedimentary fractured environments where fast and slow flow paths exist. Therefore, quantifying groundwater fluxes through various rock sections within the vadose zone and into the aquifer is of critical importance for determining aquifers storage deviation. The research objective was to investigate how the lithology changes influence flow in the unsaturated zone and the spatial and temporal variation of groundwater recharge. To assess these variations for the Western Mountain Aquifer (Yarkon-Taninim) of Israel, we considered a range of parameters values for both fractures/karst and porous media, namely; permeability, block size, spacing between fractures, karst volumetric volume, etc. A conceptual model was built for nine monitoring wells sites in the study area. A one-dimensional, dual permeability mathematical model of water flow in a variably saturated, fractured/karst-porous media was applied to simulate water flow in each location. Model parameters were determined by solving the inverse problem using data of groundwater level observations. The results of simulation show that the highest groundwater replenishment occurs in locations where fast flow paths conditions are expected, while the lowest recharges took place in locations containing low permeability layers. The spatial differences in recharge are larger during years with high precipitation which can reach a few hundred percent. Additionally, fast and slow flow paths conditions also influence annual cumulative groundwater recharge dynamic. In areas where fast flow paths exist, most of the groundwater recharge occurs during the rainy season (60-80% of the total recharge for the tested years), while in locations with slow flow path conditions the recharge rate stays relatively constant with a near linear pattern and continues during summer.",

            "abstract": "Landslides are frequently triggered by typhoons and earthquakes in Taiwan, causing serious economic losses and human casualties. Remotely sensed images and geo-spatial data consisting of land-cover and environmental information have been widely used for producing landslide inventories and causative factors for slope stability analysis. Landslide susceptibility, on the other hand, can represent the spatial likelihood of landslide occurrence and is an important basis for landslide risk assessment. As multi-temporal satellite images become popular and affordable, they are commonly used to generate landslide inventories for subsequent analysis. However, it is usually difficult to distinguish different landslide sub-regions (scarp, debris flow, deposition etc.) directly from remote sensing imagery. Consequently, the extracted landslide extents using image-based visual interpretation and automatic detections may contain many depositions that may reduce the fidelity of the landslide susceptibility model.\nThis study developed an empirical thresholding scheme based on terrain characteristics for eliminating depositions from detected landslide areas to improve landslide susceptibility modeling. In this study, Bayesian network classifier is utilized to build a landslide susceptibility model and to predict sequent rainfall-induced shallow landslides in the Shimen reservoir watershed located in northern Taiwan. Eleven causative factors are considered, including terrain slope, aspect, curvature, elevation, geology, land-use, NDVI, soil, distance to fault, river and road. Landslide areas detected using satellite images acquired before and after eight typhoons between 2004 to 2008 are collected as the main inventory for training and verification. In the analysis, previous landslide events are used as training data to predict the samples of the next event. The results are then compared with recorded landslide areas in the inventory to evaluate the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the accuracies of landslide susceptibility analysis in all sequential predictions have been improved significantly after eliminating landslide depositions.",

            "abstract": "One of the fundamental components in any dynamical model of melt transport is the rheology of partially molten rock. This rheology is poorly understood, and one way in which a better understanding can be obtained is by comparing the results of laboratory deformation experiments to numerical models. Here we present a comparison between numerical models and the laboratory setup of Qi et al. 2013 (EPSL), where a cylinder of partially molten rock containing rigid spherical inclusions was placed under torsion. We have replicated this setup in a finite element model which solves the partial differential equations describing the mechanical process of compaction. These computationally-demanding 3D simulations are only possible due to the recent development of a new preconditioning method for the equations of magma dynamics.\nThe experiments show a distinct pattern of melt-rich and melt-depleted regions around the inclusions. In our numerical models, the pattern of melt varies with key rheological parameters, such as the ratio of bulk to shear viscosity, and the porosity- and strain-rate-dependence of the shear viscosity. These observed melt patterns therefore have the potential to constrain rheological properties. While there are many similarities between the experiments and the numerical models, there are also important differences, which highlight the need for better models of the physics of two-phase mantle/magma dynamics. In particular, the laboratory experiments display more pervasive melt-rich bands than is seen in our numerics.",

            "abstract": "Injection-induced earthquake rates can vary rapidly in space and time, which presents significant challenges to traditional probabilistic seismic hazard assessment methodologies that are based on a time-independent model of mainshock occurrence. To help society cope with rapidly evolving seismicity, the USGS is developing one-year hazard models for areas of induced seismicity in the central and eastern US to forecast the shaking due to all earthquakes, including aftershocks which are generally omitted from hazards assessments (Petersen et al., 2015). However, the spatial and temporal variability of the earthquake rates make them difficult to forecast even on time-scales as short as one year. An initial approach is to use the previous year’s seismicity rate to forecast the next year’s seismicity rate. However, in places such as northern Oklahoma the rates vary so rapidly over time that a simple linear extrapolation does not accurately forecast the future, even when the variability in the rates is modeled with simulations based on an Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model (Ogata, JASA, 1988) to account for earthquake clustering.\nInstead of relying on a fixed time period for rate estimation, we explore another way to determine when the earthquake rate should be updated. This approach could also objectively identify new areas where the induced seismicity hazard model should be applied. We will estimate the background seismicity rate by optimizing a single set of ETAS aftershock triggering parameters across the most active induced seismicity zones -- Oklahoma, Guy-Greenbrier, the Raton Basin, and the Azle-Dallas-Fort Worth area -- with individual background rate parameters in each zone. The full seismicity rate, with uncertainties, can then be estimated using ETAS simulations and changes in rate can be detected by applying change point analysis in ETAS transformed time with methods already developed for Poisson processes.",

When the rings are in a high energy state the dynamics of the particles is dominated by random thermal motions. As the energy of the system is reduced the particles eventually settle into two dimensional dust chains. The time evolution of these particles from high energy random thermal motion to regular lattice structures under rapid cooling conditions has been investigated using motion tracking techniques. As the system cools, the dust particles shift and rotate in a two-dimensional plane in order to achieve an equilibrium position. Analysis shows that most particle shifts are local involving only a few particles, though some adjustments are global and involve most of the particles in the cluster. Laser induced acoustic (longitudinal) waves have also been observed in the two ring system and the dispersion relation is compared to theory.",

Therefore, an analysis with a high spatio-temporal resolution of the vulnerability assessment of water resources (VAWR) in China is burningly needed. However, to our knowledge, the temporal analysis of VAWR has been not yet addressed. Consequently, we performed, for the first time, a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of China’s water resources vulnerability (WRV), using a composite index approach with an array of aspects highlighting key challenges that China’s water resources system is nowadays facing.\nDuring our study period of 2003-2013, the political weight of China’s integrated water resources management has been increasing continuously. Hence, it is essential and significant, based on the historical socioeconomic changes influenced by water-environment policy making and implementation, to reveal China’s WRV for pinpointing key challenges to the healthy functionality of its water resources system.\nThe water resources system in North and Central Coast appeared more vulnerable than that in Western China. China’s water use efficiency has grown substantially over the study period, and so is water supply and sanitation coverage. In contrast, water pollution has been worsening remarkably in most parts of China, and so have water scarcity and shortage in the most stressed parts of the country.\nThis spatio-temporal analysis implies that the key challenges to China’s water resources system not only root in the geographical mismatch between socioeconomic development (e.g. water demand) and water resources endowments (e.g. water resources availability), but also stem from the intertwinement between socioeconomic development and national strategic policy making.",

            "abstract": "Changing patterns in detrital provenance through time have the ability to resolve salient features of an orogenic cycle. Such changes in the age spectrum of detrital minerals can be attributed to fluctuations in the geodynamic regime (e.g. opening of seaways, initiation of subduction and arc magmatism, and transition from subduction to collisional tectonics with arrival of exotic crustal material). These processes manifest themselves through a variety of sedimentary responses due to basin formation, transition from rift to drift sedimentation, or inversion and basement unroofing. This generally is charted by the presence of older detrital zircon populations during basement unroofing events and is followed by a successive younging in the detrital zircon age signature either through arrival of young island arc terranes or the progression of subduction magmatism along a continental margin. The sedimentary response to the aforementioned geodynamic environment can be visualized using a multi-dimensional scaling approach to detrital zircon age spectra. This statistical tool characterizes the “dissimilarity” of age spectra of the various sedimentary successions, but importantly also charts this measure through time.\nWe present three case studies in which multi-dimensional scaling reveals additional useful information on the style of basin evolution within the orogenic cycle. The Albany-Fraser Orogeny in Western Australia and Grenville Orogeny (sensu stricto) in Laurentia demonstrate clear patterns in which detrital zircon age spectra become more dissimilar with time. In stark contrast, sedimentary successions from the Meso- to Neoproterozoic North Atlantic Region reveal no consistent pattern. Rather, the North Atlantic Region reflects a signature consistent with significant zircon age communication due to a distal position from an orogenic front, oblique translation of terranes, and complexity of the continental margin.\nThis statistical approach provides a mechanism to connect the evolutionary patterns of detrital zircon age spectra to the geodynamics of an orogenic system, which in many cases is a direct function of proximity to the orogenic front.",

            "abstract": "Since the Sahelian population livelihood relies mainly on agropastoral activities, accurate information on biomass productivity dynamics and the underlying drivers are needed to manage a wide range of issues such as food security. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of these drivers in rangeland and cropland, both at the Sahel and local scales (an agropastoral site in South-West Niger). At the Sahel scale, the MODIS Land Cover product was used to extract cropland and rangeland pixels. By analyzing MODIS NDVI trends together with TRMM3B43 annual rainfall (2000-2010), we developed a new classification scheme allowing to identify areas of persistent decline/improvement in biomass productivity and to separate rainfall-driven dynamics from other factors. The results showed an overall increase of productivity in the rangeland, and both an improvement and a degradation in the cropland. We found strong evidence that the increase in biomass productivity was generally linked to increasing rainfall, while the decrease could be attributed chiefly to other factors exclusively or to a combination of both climate- and human-induced factors (see the attached Figure). At the Niger site scale, biomass trends have been put in relation with a set of potential drivers via a RandomForest model, to define which were the explanatory factors of the observed trends. The factor set covered 5 categories: climate, natural constraints, demography, physical accessibility and land cover changes. We highlighted that tiger bushes areas were particularly prone to pressure due to overgrazing and overexploitation of wood, while positive trends were mainly observed near rivers and in fossil valleys where new agricultural practices might have been promoted. The approach developped here could help to delineate areas with decrease in crop and grassland production and thus to assess the vulnerability of the population, but also to target zones with good potential for planning long-term food security policies.",

            "abstract": "The ability of the state-of-the-art climate models to reproduce the mean spatial characteristics of extreme precipitation indices over Africa is evaluated. The ensembles of eight precipitation-based indices as defined by ETCCDI were extracted from seventeen CMIP5 GCMs and twelve CORDEX RCMs simulations based on absolute and percentile (95th) thresholds and computed from the 1975 to 2004 historical period. Daily precipitation indices calculated from GPCP and TRMM satellite-derived observation datasets during the period 1997 to 2012 and 1998 to 2011 respectively were also employed in this study for model validation. Results of spatial representation of the frequency of extreme precipitation events (R1mm, CDD, CWD and R95p) highlight a generally good consistency between the two observations. Equally, in the regional analysis some similarities exist in their median and interquartile (25th and 75th percentile) spread especially for CDD, CWD and R95p for most regions. In the associated intensities (SDII, RX5day, R95 and R95ptot), results indicate large spatial differences between the two observational datasets, with finer resolution TRMM generating higher rainfall intensities than the coarser resolution GPCP. TRMM has also demonstrated higher median and interquartile range as compared to GPCP. The CORDEX RCMs and CMIP5 GCMs simulations have estimated more number of extreme precipitation events, while underestimated the intensities. The differences between the models and observations can be as large as the typical model interquartile spread of the ensembles for some indices (R1mm, CWD, SDII and R95) in some regions. Meanwhile, CORDEX estimations are generally closer to the observations than CMIP5 in reproducing the frequency of extreme rainfall indices. For the estimation of rainfall intensities, CORDEX simulations are in most cases more consistence with TRMM observations whilst the CMIP5 GCMs simulations are closer to GPCP observations.",

The results show that errors in lateral boundary conditions from the GCM members, have an unexpected way on the skill of the RCMs in reproducing regional climate features such as the West African Monsoon features and the annual cycle of precipitation and temperature in terms of outperforming the GCM simulation. It also shows the occurrence of the West African Monsoon jump, the intensification and northward shift of the Saharan Heat Low (SHL) as expressed in some RCMs than the GCMs. Most RCMs also capture the mean annual cycle of precipitation and temperature, including, single and double-peaked during the summer months, in terms of events and amplitude. In a series of RCMs and GCMs experiments between the Sahara region and equatorial Africa, the presence of strong positive meridional temperature gradients at the surface and a strong meridional gradients in the potential temperatures near the surface are obvious, indicating the region of strong vertical shear development enough to establish easterly flow such as the African easterly jet. In addition, the isentropic potential vorticity (IPV) gradient decreases northward in the lower troposphere across northern Africa, with the maximum reversal on the 315-K surface. The region with negative IPV gradient favors the potential instability which has been associated with the growth of easterly waves.",

            "abstract": "In a number of topical contexts, the response of fluid-filled fractures is of fundamental importance. For example, hydraulic fracturing operations typically generate multiple sub-parallel fractures that may, in turn, interact with families of preexisting natural fractures. At the In Salah carbon sequestration site, space geodetic observations of surface deformation suggested opening of a fracture and leakage of fluids into the caprock. And hydrocarbon production is often facilitated by naturally occurring fractures that are typically depressurized through production or pressurized to enhance oil recovery.\nBoth the surface deformation and the fluid flow resulting from pressure variations in a fractured medium are qualitatively different for a fractured medium compared to a medium with isotropic properties. It is straightforward to calculate the responses of a medium with a single fracture, with analytical solutions available for simple geometries. Also, in the limit of very high fracture density, continuum representations of anisotropic poroelasticity can be used. However, as in the examples above, there are many applications where a finite number of fractures are spaced closely enough that their stress fields interact. I investigate this regime numerically. Observations of both surface deformation and inferences of permeability can be effective in constraining estimates of fracture density and aperture.",

            "abstract": "Global flood risk models are now a reality. Initially, their development was driven by a demand from users for first-order global assessments to identify risk hotspots. Relentless upward trends in flood damage over the last decade have enhanced interest in such assessments. The adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts have made these efforts even more essential.\nAs a result, global flood risk models are being used more and more in practice, by an increasingly large number of practitioners and decision-makers. However, they clearly have their limits compared to local models. To address these issues, a team of scientists and practitioners recently came together at the Global Flood Partnership meeting to critically assess the question ‘What can(’t) we do with global flood risk models?’. The results of this dialogue (Ward et al., 2013) will be presented, opening a discussion on similar broader initiatives at the science-policy interface in other natural hazards.\nIn this contribution, examples are provided of successful applications of global flood risk models in practice (for example together with the World Bank, Red Cross, and UNISDR), and limitations and gaps between user ‘wish-lists’ and model capabilities are discussed. Finally, a research agenda is presented for addressing these limitations and reducing the gaps.\nWard, P.J. et al., 2015. Nature Climate Change, doi:10.1038/nclimate2742.",

            "abstract": "Most previous turbulence observations in the solar wind were made for large- and moderate-amplitude fluctuations, which include current sheets and intermittent structures. Here we first present the spectral analysis on the low-amplitude fluctuations that may be considered as nearly stationary, and compare the results with those of moderate-amplitude fluctuations which show intermittency. By using measurements from the WIND spacecraft, we present spectral features as derived by the FFT method from 6-minute time series of magnetic fluctuations with low relative amplitudes of only 0.05 to 0.11. When comparing their spectra with those of moderate-amplitude fluctuations (relative amplitude of about 0.4), we find that for the low-amplitude fluctuations the averaged spectral indices are -1.67 and -1.46, respectively for small and large sampling angles, i.e. the angle between the Sun-to-Earth radial direction and the mean magnetic field direction. However, for the moderate-amplitude fluctuations, these two indices are -1.89 and -1.70, respectively. This result of the moderate-amplitude fluctuations is consistent with that of previous analyses, which by using the wavelet technique revealed spectral anisotropy and yielded an index of -2 in the parallel direction and -5/3 in the perpendicular direction. But the result found here for the low-amplitude fluctuations was not reported before, and thus will probably initiate new studies aiming to understand better the turbulence nature of such low-amplitude fluctuations. Future studies will help us to understand why the spectral anisotropy differs for fluctuations of different amplitudes.",

            "abstract": "The inverted metamorphism associated with the Main Central thrust zone in the Himalaya has been historically attributed to a number of tectonic processes. Here we show that there is actually a composite peak and deformation temperature sequence that formed in succession via different tectonic processes. The deformation partitioning seems to the have played a key role, and the magnitude of each process has varied along strike of the orogen.\nTo explain the formation of the inverted metamorphic sequence across the Lesser Himalayan Sequence (LHS) in eastern Bhutan, we used Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous material (RSCM) to determine the peak metamorphic temperatures and Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry to determine the deformation temperatures combined with thermochronology including published apatite and zircon U-Th/He and fission-track data and new 40Ar/39Ar dating of muscovite. The dataset was inverted using 3D-thermal-kinematic modeling to constrain the ranges of geological parameters such as fault geometry and slip rates, location and rates of localized basal accretion, and thermal properties of the crust.\nRSCM results indicate that there are two peak temperature sequences separated by a major thrust within the LHS. The internal temperature sequence shows an inverted peak temperature gradient of 12 °C/km; in the external (southern) sequence, the peak temperatures are constant across the structural sequence. Thermo-kinematic modeling suggest that the thermochronologic and thermobarometric data are compatible with a two-stage scenario: an Early-Middle Miocene phase of fast overthrusting of a hot hanging wall over a downgoing footwall and inversion of the synkinematic isotherms, followed by the formation of the external duplex developed by dominant underthrusting and basal accretion. To reconcile our observations with the experimental data, we suggest that pervasive ductile deformation within the upper LHS and along the Main Central thrust zone at its top stopped at ~11 Ma at which time the deformation shifted and focused within the external duplex and the Main Boundary Thrust.",

            "abstract": "The long-term slip on faults has to follow, on average, the plate motion, while slip deficit is accumulated over shorter time scales (e.g., between the large earthquakes). Accumulated slip deficits eventually have to be released by earthquakes and aseismic processes. In this study, we propose a new inversion approach for coseismic slip, taking interseismic slip deficit as prior information. We assume a linear correlation between coseismic slip and interseismic slip deficit, and invert for the coefficients that link the coseismic displacements to the required strain accumulation time and seismic release level of the earthquake. We apply our approach to the 2011 M9 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake and the 2010 M8.7 Maule earthquake. Under the assumption that the largest slip almost fully releases the local strain (as indicated by borehole measurements,\nLin et al., 2013\n), our results suggest that the strain accumulated along the Tohoku-Oki earthquake segment has been almost fully released during the 2011 M9 rupture. The remaining slip deficit can be attributed to the postseismic processes. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake; while the Maule earthquake only released about one quarter of the local strain. We estimate the required time of strain accumulation for the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake to be ~25 years (confidence interval of [17, 43] years), consistent with the observed average recurrence time of ~22 years for M6 earthquakes in Parkfield. For the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, we estimate the recurrence time of ~500-700 years. The recurrence time relevant to the Maule earthquake is estimated to be about 350 years. This new inversion approach for evaluating slip balance can be generally applied to any earthquake for which dense geodetic measurements are available.",

Geochronological and geochemical data on Neoproterozoic granitoids in Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif are presented in order to shed light on the genesis and the genetic link to the tectonic evolution of Rodinia. LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb ages of 915±4 Ma, 841±5 Ma, and 917±4 Ma, were obtained for two granodiorites and one monzogranite, respectively. These granitoids have SiO2 = 67.89–71.18 wt.%, MgO = 0.53–0.88 wt.%, and Na2O+K2O = 6.48–9.61 wt.%, and are chemically a calc-alkaline series. They are characterized by enrichment in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements, and depletion in heavy rare earth elements and high field strength elements such as Nb, Ta, and Ti, consistent with the chemistry of igneous rocks from an active continental margin setting. The zircons with different ages (ca. 915~917 and 841 Ma) from these granitoids share similar characteristics in Hf isotopic composition. In situ Hf analyses of zircons show that εHf (t) values and two-stage model ages of –4.7 ~ +1.5 and 1.7~1.9 Ga, respectively. It is evidence that these Neoproterozoic granitoids were derived from the reworking of the Paleoproterozoic continental crust. The above findings, combined with the regional geologic information, imply that these granitoids formed under an active continental margin setting related to the assembly of Rodinia in the early stage of Neoproterozoic. Meanwhile, similar magmatic events history also suggests that the Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif have an affinity to the Siberia Craton.

            "abstract": "Blended acquisition technique can be used to improve the efficiency in marine seismic exploration, but the separation of blended wavefields is a key factor for conventional processing. When the blended record is sorted from the common shot gather to other domains, the aliasing signal of secondary source will be transformed into a random distribution noise. In this paper, we produce an adaptive iteration multilevel method to achieve multi-source separation. Based on an adaptive iterative multilevel median filtering method, aliasing noise can be removed in a large window first, but at the same time it will lost the details of the wanted wavefields. Then we can gradually extract more details by reducing the median filter window size. We test three simultaneous acquisitions for marine synthetic seismic data to verity the reliability of the method, and apply this method to the real blended data which was acquired from a marine area. The result shows that a single shot record of each source is clear after the separation, and the spectral features are similar. Thus the method in this paper is proved to have a good practical value.",

            "abstract": "Space-based pollution monitoring from current and planned satellite UV-Vis spectrometers play an increasingly important role in studies of tropospheric chemistry and also air quality applications to help mitigate anthropogenic and natural impacts on sensitive ecosystems, and human health. We present long-term changes in tropospheric SO2 and NO2 over some of the most polluted industrialized regions of the world observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard NASA’s Aura satellite. Using OMI data, we identified about 400 SO2 “hot spots” and estimated emissions from them. In many regions emissions and their ambient pollution levels have decreased significantly, such as over eastern US, Europe and China. OMI observed about 50% reduction in SO2 and NO2 pollution over the North China plain in 2012-2014 that can be attributed to both government efforts to restrain emissions from the power and industrial sectors and the economic slowdown. While much smaller, India’s SO2 and NO2 emissions from coal power plants and smelters are growing at a fast pace, increasing by about 200% and 50% from 2005 to 2014. Over Europe and the US OMI-observed trends agree well with those from available in situ measurements of surface concentrations, deposition and emissions data. However, for some regions (e.g., Mexico, Middle East) the emission inventories may be incomplete and OMI can provide emission estimates for missing sources, such as SO2 sources observed over the Persian Gulf. It is essential to continue long-term overlapping satellite data records of air quality with increased spatial and temporal resolution to resolve point pollution sources using oversampling technique. We discuss how Aura OMI pollution measurements and emission estimates will be continued with the US JPSS and European Sentinel series for the next 20 years and further enhanced by the addition of three geostationary UV-VIS instruments.",

            "abstract": "In this big data era, it is more urgent than ever to solve two major issues: (1) fast data transmission method that can facilitate access to data from non-local sources, and (2) fast and efficient data analysis methods that can reveal the key information from the available data for particular purposes. Although approaches in different fields to address these two questions may differ significantly, the common part must involve data compression techniques and fast algorithm.\nIn this paper, we introduce the recently developed adaptive and spatiotemporally local analysis method, namely the fast multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD), for the analysis of large spatiotemporal dataset. The original MEEMD uses ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to decompose time series at each spatial grid and then pieces together the temporal-spatial evolution of climate variability and change on naturally separated timescales, which is computationally expensive. By taking the advantage of the high efficiency of the principle component analysis/empirical orthogonal function (PCA/EOF) expression for spatiotemporally coherent data, we design a lossy compression method for climate data to facilitate its non-local transmission. In addition to that, we also explain the basic principles behind the fast MEEMD through decomposing PCs instead of original grid-wise time series to speedup computation of MEEMD. Using a typical climate dataset as an example, we demonstrate that our newly designed methods can (1) compress data with a compression rate of one to two orders; (2) speed up the MEEMD algorithm by one to two orders.",

            "abstract": "Recent theoretical advances now enable accurate characterization of both the single scattering and multiple scattering contributions to the lidar backscatter signals obtained from opaque water clouds (Hu et al., 2006). As a consequence, lidar measurements of opaque water clouds have increasingly broad applications, especially for space-based polarization-sensitive lidars such as CALIOP. Among the most prominent and useful of these are (1) calibration and assessments of calibration accuracy (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2006); (2) accurate estimates of extrinsic (e.g., optical depths) and intrinsic (e.g., extinction-to-backscatter ratios) optical properties of clouds and aerosol layers lying above opaque water clouds (Hu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2015); and (3) retrievals of water cloud microphysical properties such as cloud droplet number concentrations (Hu et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2014).\nIn the first part of this presentation we give an overview of the recent advances in this subject area. The second part introduces several new studies of water clouds using the multi-wavelength depolarization measurement capabilities of NASA’s airborne high spectral resolution lidars (HSRL). We use these measurements to assess existing theory, validate the measurement concept and explore several new application concepts.

            "abstract": "The unprecedented high-quality seismic data from Earthscope’s Transportable Array provide us a great opportunity to investigate the subsurface structure beneath North America. Even with such a fine network, tightly constraining the 3D lithospheric structure is a challenge. Integrating complementary geophysical observations in simultaneous inversions has produced promising results. We have developed a receiver-function wavefield interpolation/smoothing method to enhance the complementariness of receiver functions and surface-wave dispersion. Combining information from adjacent seismic stations suppresses poorly sampled and difficult-to-interpret back-azimuthal variations and allows the stable extraction of the key features in the receiver-function wavefield. The interpolated receiver functions are inverted simultaneously with Rayleigh-wave phase and group velocities and Bouguer gravity observations to produce a robust estimate of the broad 3D shear-wave speed variations beneath the eastern United States. P-wave velocities and density variations are related to shear-speed using empirical velocity ratios and relations. We constrain the 3D variations to be laterally and vertically smooth. Application of the same methods to the western conterminous United States resulted in velocity images that are consistent with published models on the first order. With the completion of the Transportable Array deployment in the northeast US, the seismic dataset beneath the eastern U.S. region is complete. Preliminary inversions contain expected near-surface low shear-wave speeds associated with large basins and coastal regions and thicker crust beneath the interior compared with the coastal regions. Speeds in the upper mantle are generally typical, but the model includes several regions of relatively slow mantle beneath the northern Mississippi Embayment, the east coast, and beneath New England.",

            "abstract": "The critical balance theory (GS, Goldreich and Sridhar, 1995) in MHD turbulence seems now to be well accepted in the turbulence community. During recent years, quite a few papers claimed to have provided evidence in support of this theory by solar wind turbulence observations. Here we present new data that result in a different conclusion, namely that the previous observations cannot be considered as evidence for the GS theory. It is based on the critical balance assumption that the parallel Alfven wave propagation time equals the perpendicular cascade time, k⊥v⊥=k//VA. Assuming that the cascading energy flux does not change with scale, a spectral index of -2 is obtained for the parallel power spectrum P(k//). To check this theoretical prediction, small sampling angle (θRB) with the mean magnetic field averaged at the local time and the local scale is used for selecting the local power spectral densities (PSDs). We recovered that the so averaged PSDs at different scales have a nearly -2 slope. However, using 30 days of Ulysses data we discovered that the critical balance assumption was invalid in the corresponding data analysis. The values of δB/B0 corresponding to the selected local PSDs are all found to be much smaller than the required value of tan(θRB). Most of the observations with a small sampling angle may be considered to be rather more perpendicular from the theoretical point of view. We also found that the spectral index of the selected PSDs depends on the selection criterion. If one guarantees constantly small sampling angles in a local time period, the slope of the selected PSD changes to -1.7. Thus our conclusion is that no evidence exists that solar wind turbulence can be described by the GS theory. What is the true origin of the spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence remains an important open question.",

            "abstract": "Droughts are “creeping” natural hazards that are usually related to extended time periods with rainfall deficiency when compared to average statistics. Characterization of regional, present and future, droughts associated with climate natural variability and/or global changes are important to assess their impact on water resource availability. In this work, we make use of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to identify and quantify, at different timescales, precipitation deficits and droughts in the northern part of the Tuscany Region (Italy). The study site extends from the Appenine to the Tirrenian Sea and has an area, of about 3000 km2. Historical rainfall data collected in the last 90 years are available in gauging stations covering the entire area. We first analyzed the historical drought (in terms of SPI) frequencies in comparison with those of the last decade. It seems likely that an increase in droughts in the last period, at all timescale, can be detected from the available data. Then, to evaluate the effects of natural climate variabilities which, as some Authors as pointed out, can be far greater than climate change signals, we made use of a multi-site weather generator to produce synthetic rainfall time-series that match the statistical properties of the historical data. In this way we provided equally likely alternative realizations of the last decade climate useful to explore the variability and evaluate the uncertainty of the present drought frequencies. Moreover, to characterize the possible upcoming droughts (next 25 and 40 years) we made use of synthetic future rainfall time-series. For this purpose, we modified the weather generator parameters on the basis of available RCM climate model outputs under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. This study is a first step, for the local water supply company, to understand the need of implementing immediate and/or medium-tem water conservation activities and drought response measures over the area.",

This interaction begins at a local scale, i.e. between surface fluxes and the near-surface atmosphere, with the strength of near-surface land-atmosphere coupling dependent on the relationship between soil moisture and evapotranspiration, a function of the surface-layer turbulence and vegetation and soil properties, where for strong land-atmosphere coupling, a given change in soil moisture yields a large change in evapotranspiration, and conversely for weak coupling, the change in soil moisture yields only a small change in evapotranspiration. Following a conceptual development, we use observations from surface flux sites to examine the various aspects of local land-atmosphere interaction, then extend this to the global scale by assessing the coupling using a global land data assimilation (GLDAS) data set from NCEP.",

The complex mountain terrain and vast area of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) make such factors particularly important. With daily data from 161 meteorological stations over the past 43 years (1970–2012), we analyse the spatio-temporal variations of TLRs, WSGs, and PGs over and around TP, derived using linear regression methods and dividing the study area into zones based on spatial variations. Results of this study include: (1) The observed TLR varies from −0.46 to −0.73 ∘C (100 m) −1, with averaged TLRs of −0.60,−0.62, and −0.59 ∘C (100 m) −1 for Tmax, Tmin,and Tmean , respectively. The averaged TLR is slightly less than the global mean of −0.65 ∘C (100 m) −1 . The spatial variability of TLR relates to climate conditions, wherein the TLR increases in dry conditions and in cold months (October–April), while it lessens in humid regions and during warm months (May–September). (2) The estimated annual WSG ranges from 0.07 to 0.17m s −1 (100 m) −1. Monthly WSGs show a marked seasonal shift, in which higher WSGs can be explained by the high intensity of prevailing wind. (3) Positive summer PGs vary from 12.08 in the central TP to 26.14 mm (100 m) −1 in northeastern Qinghai and the southern TP, but a reverse gradient prevails in Yunnan and parts of Sichuan Province. (4) The regional warming over TP is more evident in winter, and Tmin demonstrated the most prominent warming compared with Tmax and Tmean. Environments at high elevations experience more rapid changes in temperatures (Tmax, Tmin,and Tmean) than those at low elevations, which is especially true in winter and for Tmin. Furthermore, inter-annual variation of TLRs is linked to elevation-dependent warming.",

It is difficult to quantify, yet may be vulnerable to changes in amount and frequency due to warming climate. Cloud immersion is characterized and monitored as part of the ecohydrology research of the USGS Water, Energy and Biogeochemical Budgets (WEBB) program and the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). Stable-isotope studies indicated cloud water may contribute significantly to headwater streamflow, and measurements with an active-strand collector yielded estimates of overnight cloud water deposition rates on Pico del Este (1050 m); but cloud liquid water content and spatial and temporal variability are not well understood. At five sites spanning the lifting condensation level to ridge-top (600-1000 m) in the Luquillo Mountains, cloud immersion conditions are monitored using time-lapse photography and temperature/ relative humidity (T/RH) sensors. A ceilometer, installed at 99 m on the windward slope on 4/29/2013, provides longer-term data to understand variation in cloud base altitude and to detect changes that may occur with warming climate. The cloud-zone sites range from tropical wet forest (mixed species) to rain forest (sierra palm) to elfin cloud forest. T/RH sensors indicated foggy conditions when temperature < dewpoint, but they are not sensitive to varying water content in the cloud. Images were processed to determine frequency and duration of immersion and estimates of optical density of cloud. Spatial heterogeneity in cloud immersion is assessed by comparing ceilometer measurements to the images. These complementary data sets provide quantification of spatial and temporal patterns of cloud immersion, and areal estimates of cloud water deposition will be made to determine importance in the water budget.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 on chloride-containing aerosols transforms N2O5 into nitrate and ClNO2. The production of nitrate is the loss pathway of NOx, while the formation and subsequent photolysis of ClNO2 acts as temporary reservoir of NOx and source of Cl atom, which reacts with VOCs like OH radical. The N2O5 uptake and ClNO2 production, therefore, influences the reactive nitrogen and ozone chemistry. Hong Kong and Pearl River Delta (the latter is known as the world factory), which are located in Southern China, has been experiencing severe photochemical and haze pollution in recent years. But the role of the N2O5 heterogeneous chemistry has not been studied. Yet elevated concentrations of N2O5 and ClNO2 have been observed at a high-altitude site in Hong Kong, suggesting the potential significance of the N2O5 and ClNO2 chemistry in this region. In this study, Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model, which is a widely used coupled meteorology-chemistry model, was further developed to incorporate the parameterization of N2O5 heterogeneous reaction, ClNO2 production, and gas phase reactions of Cl with VOCs and then to evaluate the impacts on reactive nitrogen and tropospheric ozone in this region. The implementation of N2O5 and ClNO2 chemistry improved model performance of air pollutants. The updated model was able to reproduce the observed temporal patterns of N2O5 and ClNO2 at the mountain top site. We will present the simulations of effects of the N2O5 heterogeneous reactions and ClNO2 production on the concentrations of NOx, total nitrate, and ozone in the planetary boundary layer of Southern China. Overall, our study suggests significant impacts of the N2O5 and ClNO2 processes on reactive nitrogen budget and ozone chemistry and the necessity to consider them in future atmospheric chemistry modelling studies.",

The difficulties global climate models have in representing the areal extent and temporal variability of these clouds has motivated numerous observational and modeling studies over the last two decades. New observations have challenged accepted explanations for the underlying physical mechanisms that modulate marine stratocumulus. Recent work has revised thinking on the relative importance of feedbacks among aerosols, microphysics, dynamics and radiation. This presentation will showcase some new observational findings of marine stratocumulus that do not fit current theories. For example, data reveal: large multi-day (3-50 days) variability of cloud amount; mesoscale spatial patterns of drizzle cells that are remarkably static for more than 2 hours; individual drizzle cells lifetimes that exceed 2 times the rainout timescale; and shallow clouds < 500 m thick that generate intense rainfall (> 38 dBZ). Further, what potential mechanisms explain why the seasonal variation in the diurnal cycle of regional cloudiness shows the greatest variation in the southeast Atlantic and least in the northeast Pacific? These observations point the way for potential new research that may inspire a more comprehensive physical understanding of marine stratocumulus clouds.",

            "abstract": "Abstract\nOver the past fifty years global climate change has altered various environmental processes. Due to global climate change early snowmelt is occurring more frequently throughout much of the world. The increasing frequency of these events is a relatively new phenomena and it is challenging the effectiveness of current water resource management and flood forecasting best practices. Early snowmelt events are caused by a brief period of unusually high air temperature, high humidity, or rain-on-snow. This research focuses on the detection of rain-on-snow events using remote sensing approaches to identify the frequency, extent and magnitude of these events. Early snow melt events, driven by rainfall with the presence of snow, are identified from The Flood Observatory archives. Passive microwave data from the AMSR-E and SSM/I instruments are compared with MODIS imagery and field observations to assess the microwave products’ reliability in capturing these events. Early melt detection algorithms that use passive microwave retrievals for northern latitude areas, primarily Alaska and Canada, were evaluated in the continental United States. These algorithms failed to capture mid latitude early snow melt events primarily due to climatological differences between northern and mid latitude areas. This research developed an alternative algorithm using the passive microwave signature that reflects the inherent characteristics of mid latitude rain-on-snow events. The two algorithms are compared for their relative value in detecting mid latitude rain-on-snow events. Performance is linked to climatological signatures of observed rain-on-snow events.",

            "abstract": "According to several theories, the beam instability induced by shock-accelerated ions can generate upstream-propagating Alfvén waves (UPAWs) with a bump near 0.03 Hz in the power spectrum, while the nonlinear wave-wave interaction favors an inverse cascade to create a power-law spectrum. Here we present the first observational evidence for the upstream-propagating Alfvénic fluctuations (UPAFs) with power-law spectra by using measurements from the WIND spacecraft in year 1995. We utilize a new criterion to identify the upstream-propagating Alfvénic intervals: the propagation direction is opposite to that of solar wind strahl electron outflow. Besides 35 UPAWs, we find 47 UPAFs with power-law spectra, and ~47% of these UPAFs are associated with energetic ion events (>30 keV). These UPAWs and UPAFs are mostly observed in the slow solar wind. However, their occurrence rate and power behave differently in dependence on the radial distance from the Earth. The spectral indices of UPAFs are between -3 and -2. These power-law spectra cannot be explained by the linear ion-beam instability. The results provide new clues on understanding the dynamic equilibrium between the non-linear inverse cascade and the linear ion-beam instability.",

            "abstract": "We present a research program to produce a solar spectral irradiance (SSI) record suitable for whole atmosphere chemistry-climate model (CCM) transient studies over the 2001-2015 time period for Solar Cycle 23 and 24 (SC23-24). Climate simulations during this time period are particularly valuable because SC23-24 represents the best-observed solar cycle in history – both from the perspective of solar physics and in terms of Earth observation systems. This record will be based predominantly on the observed irradiance of the SORCE mission as measured by the SIM and SOLSTICE instruments from April of 2003 to the present time. The SSI data record for this proposed study requires very broad wavelength coverage (115-100000 nm), daily spectral coverage, compliance of the integrated SSI record with the TSI, and well-defined and documented uncertainty estimates. While the majority of the record will be derived from SORCE observations, extensions back to the SC23 maximum time period (early 2001) and closure of critical gaps in the SORCE record will be generated employing the Fontenla et al. (2015) Solar Radiation Physical Model (SRPMv2). Since SRPM is a physics-based model, estimates of the SSI for wavelengths outside the SORCE measurement range can be meaningfully included. This model now includes non-LTE contributions from metals in the atomic number range 22-28 (i.e. titanium through nickel) as well as important molecular photo-disassociation contributions from molecules such as NH, molecular hydrogen, CH, and OH led have led to greatly improved agreement between the model and the observed 0.1 nm SOLSTICE spectrum. Thus comparative studies of the SORCE observations with SRPMv2 provide meaningful insight into the nature of solar variability critical for subsequent Earth atmospheric modeling efforts.",

            "abstract": "The Noto Peninsula is located in the backarc region of southwest Japan and is characterized by geomorphologic features formed by active tectonics and glacial eustasy through the Quaternary. Pleistocene marine terraces along the northern coast of the Noto Peninsula indicate uplift in the coastal area through the late Quaternary (Ota and Hirakawa, 1979). Recently, an active fault zone on the seafloor off the coast was found and was divided into four segments, Monzen-oki, Saruyama-oki, Wajima-oki, and Suzu-oki, from west to east (Inoue and Okamura, 2010).\nWe investigated vertical displacement along the coast using intertidal sessile organisms at nine sites on the rocky coast. We measured the height of fossilized Pomatoleios kraussii by GPS surveying together with a sea-level change curve, and dated them using the AMS 14C method. The vertical displacements and dates at the sites implied that coastal uplift occurred along 20 km of coastline, corresponding to the Wajima-oki segment zone, and most likely between 1600 and 1800 AD. This is coincident with seismic damage in this area in 1729 AD recorded in historical documents.\nWe constructed a fault model with three rectangular faults in a homogeneous elastic half-space and estimated the optimal net slip and rake by a non-linear inversion method (Matsu’ura and Hasegawa, 1987). The best fit to the estimated vertical displacements is provided by a net slip of 1.8 m with a rake of 90° for the western fault plane and a net slip of 0.6 m with a rake of 90° for the center and the eastern fault planes. The moment magnitude (Mw) calculated from these parameters with a rigidity of 30 GPa is 6.6. We compared the elevation distribution of the former shorelines based on coastal terraces and the 1729 earthquake uplifts. Assuming that the coastal uplift is caused by the cumulative crustal deformation produced by the same size event as the 1729 earthquake, the average recurrence interval of the events is estimated to be 1700 years.",

            "abstract": "Formation of fragments as the result of dynamic processes associated with impulsive loads has been the subject of numerous studies ranging from shaped-charge jet break up and rock blasting to bolide impacts, and, more recently, earthquake rupture. The dynamic strength of solids is varies as a strong function of loading rate, and, in completely failed solids, the characteristic size of fragments is related to the loading dynamics. In this study, we present some novel results using fragmentation of an “order” parameter in an isotropic body, while we use a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formulation to infer characteristics of the fragments. The order parameter is related to general rigidity of the system and is investigated in 3D space including amplitude and phase modes. To this end, we use the idea of the formation of topological defects in the course of rapid pressure changes and show that a power-law scaling describes transient strength versus inverse of the stress-ramp time. Furthermore, we illustrate that the coefficient of this power-law is deeply connected to relaxation (healing) time of the body. In addition, we show that dynamic polarization patterns of the dynamic cracks are analogous to the transition from ferrimagnets to paramagnets, providing insight to the dynamics of microscopic-scale catastrophic failure. This connection helps us to use the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) to infer the size of fragments from loading rate when considering a linear loading ramp. The idea behind the KZM is to compare the relaxation time (or healing time of the system in equilibrium) with the timescale of change of the control parameter (ε). In addition, we discuss a case where inherent defects are present prior to the impulse load and discuss the effect of impurities on the scaling coefficients. To support our approach, we use the results of fast-loading experiments on Westerly Granite supported by recording multiple acoustic emissions.",

            "abstract": "Rock weathering and soil formation in the critical zone are important for material cycle from the solid Earth to superficial system. Laterite is a major type of soil in South China forming at hot-humid climate, which has strong effect on the global uranium cycle. Uranium is closely related to the environmental redox condition because U is stable at U(Ⅳ) in anoxic condition and U(Ⅵ) as soluble uranyl ion (UO22+) under oxic circumstance. In order to understand the behavior of U isotopes during crust weathering, here we report uranium isotopic compositions of soil and base rock samples from a laterite profile originated from extreme weathering of basalt in Guangdong, South China.\nThe uranium isotopic data were measured on a Nu Plasma MC-ICP-MS at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign using the double spike method. The δ238U of BCR-1 is -0.29±0.03‰ (relative to the international standard CRM-112A), corresponding to a 238U/235U ratio of 137.911±0.004. Our result of BCR-1 agrees with previous analyses (e.g., -0.28‰ in Weyer et al. 2008) [1]. U contents of the laterite profile decrease from 1.9 ppm to 0.9 ppm with depth, and peak at 160 - 170 cm (2.3 ppm), much higher than the U content of base rocks (~0.5 ppm). In contrary, U/Th of laterites is lower than that of base rock (0.27) except the peak at the depth of 160-170 cm (0.38), indicating significant U loss during weathering. Notably, U isotope compositions of soils show a small variation from -0.38 to -0.28‰, consistent with the base rock within analytical error (0.05‰ to 0.08‰, 2sd). Such small variation can be explained by a “rind effect” (Wang et al., 2015) [2], by which U(Ⅳ) can be completely oxidized to U(VI) layer by layer during basalt weathering by dissolved oxygen. Therefore, our study indicates that U loss during basalt weathering at the hot-humid climate does not change U isotope composition of superficial water system.\n[1] Weyer S. et al.

            "abstract": "The standard model of an erupting volcano is one in which the viscosity of a decompressing magma increases as the volatiles leave the melt structure to form bubbles.\nIt has now been observed that the addition of the “volatiles” P, Cl and F result in an increase in silicate melt viscosity. This observation would mean that the viscosity of selected degassing magmas would decrease rather than increase.\nHere we look at P, Cl and F as three volatiles which increase viscosity through different structural mechanisms. In all three cases the volatiles increase the viscosity of peralkaline composition melts, but appear to always decrease the viscosity of peraluminous melts.\nPhosphorus causes the melt to unmix into a Na-P rich phase and a Na-poor silicate phase. Thus as the network modifying Na (or Ca) are removed to the phosphorus–rich melt, the matrix melt viscosity increases. With increasing amounts of added phosphorus (at network modifying Na ~ P) the addition of further phosphorus causes a decrease in viscosity.\nThe addition of chlorine to Fe-free aluminosilicate melts results in an increase in viscosity. NMR data on these glass indicates that the chlorine sits in salt-like structures surrounded by Na and/or Ca. Such structures would remove network-modifying atoms from the melt structure and thus result in an increase in viscosity. The NMR spectra of fluorine-bearing glasses shows that F takes up at least 5 different structural positions in peralkaline composition melts. Three of these positions should result in a decrease in viscosity due to the removal of bridging oxygens. Two of the structural positons of F, however, should result in an increase in viscosity as they require the removal of network-modifying atoms from the melt structure (with one of the structures being that observed for Cl). This would imply that increasing amounts of F might result in an increase in viscosity. This proposed increase in viscosity with increasing F has now been experimentally confirmed.",

Since 1976, eighty-seven >Mw5.0 earthquakes have happened in the rift regions, and fifty-five events have normal faulting focal mechanisms according to the GCMT catalog. These rifts and normal faults are associated with both the EW-trending extension of the southern Tibet and the convergence between Indian and Tibet. The 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal great earthquake and its Mw7.3 aftershock occurred at the main Himalayan Thrust zone and caused tremendous damages in Kathmandu region. Those earthquakes will lead to significant viscoelastic deformation and stress changes in the southern Tibet in the future. To evaluate the seismic hazard in the active rift regions in southern Tibet, we modeled the slip distribution of the 2015 Nepal great earthquakes using the InSAR displacement field from the ALOS-2 satellite SAR data, and calculated the Coulomb failure stress (CFS) on these active normal faults in the rift zones. Because the estimated CFS depends on the geometrical parameters of receiver faults, it is necessary to get the accurate fault parameters in the rift zones. Some historical earthquakes have been studied using the field data, teleseismic data and InSAR observations, but results are in not agreement with each other. In this study, we revaluated the geometrical parameters of seismogenic faults occurred in the rift zones using some high-quality coseismic InSAR observations and teleseismic body-wave data. Finally, we will evaluate the seismic hazard in the rift zones according to the value of the estimated CFS and aftershock distribution.",

            "abstract": "Reliable estimation of the surface energy budgets over urban areas is crucial for many applications such as water resource management and weather forecasting. Among the urban heat fluxes required inputting parameters, the vegetative fraction coverage (VFC) factor is one of the most difficult to be retrieved over intra-urban scales. Traditional methods for the extraction of VFC from remote sensing data using vegetation indices such as NDVI were found to have large uncertainty due to its sensitivity to the surface heterogeneous characteristic. This study presents a Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) based approach of Landsat TM data to map the VFC for the use in the modeling of urban heat fluxes, in the case of Beijing, China. Two models (Two-Source model (TSEB) and Pixel Component Arranging and Comparing Algorithm (PCACA)), which have different input requirements and levels of complexity, but both owe operational capabilities, were adopted for evaluation of VFC on urban heat fluxes.\nA comparative analysis between NDVI-based and SMA-based urban VFC showed that the latter achieved more accurate VFC values for complex urban regions. Moreover, the SMA-based urban VFC could be utilized to produce a more detailed spatial variability in studied urban heat fluxes (i.e. Bowen ratio and latent heat flux (LE)) as well as a higher precision when used as input to both Big-Leaf and PCACA model. Our study also revealed that the LANDSAT TM retrieved VFC value is more sensitive in obtaining urban heat fluxes for Big-Leaf model relative than PCACA model. PCACA model may be more practical for surface heat flux research when the study region is relatively complex and the required parameters are insufficient. In addition, for the three selected metropolises (Beijing, Shijiazhuang and Suzhou) with dissimilar urban vegetation cover conditions, an exponential relationship was found obviously between the VFC and LE/VFC in terms of both overall and zonal analysis regarding on both TSEB and PCACA model, meaning that different VFC can impacts the LE with different degree. We found that small patches of urban greens in high dense built-up areas would be more effective in alleviating urban heat stress.",

            "abstract": "Coral U-series geochronology is an important tool for calibrating records of sea level change during the late Quaternary and coral 14C dates for the radiocarbon timescale. However, coralline aragonite is highly susceptible to diagenesis, and samples must be carefully screened to ensure a specimen is unaltered. One method used to accept or reject U-series ages is the initial coral 234U/238U activity ratio, which reflects the 234U/238U activity of seawater at the time of coral skeleton formation. Due to the long residence time of uranium in the ocean (~400,000 years), researchers often assume that seawater 234U/238U has remained constant throughout the late Pleistocene. Coral specimens whose U-series ages yield an initial 234U/238U value that is significantly different than modern seawater are considered altered. Several studies have demonstrated that coral initial 234U/238U and, hence, seawater 234U/238U may have varied significantly on glacial-interglacial timescales, but the cause of this variability is subject to debate.\nTo evaluate the pattern and mechanisms of 234U/238U variability in seawater over the last glacial cycle, we draw upon a compilation of U-series measurements of shallow and deep water corals to better define the observed variability. Observed trends from the coral record will be assessed using a simple two-box model of the ocean to determine how changes to the ocean’s uranium isotope budget during glacial cycles can explain shifts in seawater 234U/238U. An improved understanding the evolution of seawater 234U/238U composition will enable more robust interpretations of both closed-system and open-system ages for corals. Such interpretations of U-series ages are essential to the development of robust chronologies for climate and sea level change and for improving the calibration of the radiocarbon timescale.",

            "abstract": "Simulations from hydrological models are affected by potentially large uncertainties stemming from boundary and initial conditions, model parameters, and observational uncertainty due to errors in collection and post-processing, e.g. temporal and spatial interpolation, of the input (typically rainfall and temperature) and output data (streamflow). Understanding the relative importance of such sources of uncertainty and their possible interactions is essential to support model calibration, validation and diagnostic evaluation, and to prioritize efforts for uncertainty reduction. These relative influences and their interactions are likely to vary across time and between catchments. For instance, accurate characterisation of the temperature gradient might be essential in snow-dominated catchments and especially during the snow accumulation/melt period; errors in rainfall measurement and interpolation are expected to be mostly influential in the rising phase of a flood event; observational errors might become far less influential with respect to parameter uncertainty during the recession phase.\nTraditional applications of sensitivity analysis (SA) rely on the aggregation of simulation results, typically by defining a measure of model performance like the root mean squared error. This aggregation of propagated uncertainties prior to a SA may lead to a significant loss of information and may cover up local behaviour that could be of great interest. Time-varying sensitivity analysis, where the aggregation and SA are repeated at different time-steps, is a viable option to reduce the loss of information and for obtaining a more accurate picture of the model behaviour. In this work, we address questions like: what are the specific time periods where different uncertainty sources (e.g. observations or parameters) dominate the model response and therefore uncertainty reduction would be most beneficial? How does this temporal uncertainty impact change in catchments with different characteristics (e.g. snow-dominated or intermittent)? Lessons learnt in this study will provide guidance for efforts towards uncertainty reduction and improve data gathering versus improving model diagnostics.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that only a small portion of radiated power from a very low frequency (VLF) loop antenna is transferred to an electromagnetic part of VLF wave spectrum (whistler modes) with the rest of radiated power lying in a quasi-electrostatic part of the VLF wave spectrum – low oblique resonance oscillations (LOR). In order to increase portion of radiated power going into the electromagnetic part of the wave spectrum concept of a parametric antenna in the ionospheric plasma is analyzed. Such antennas are capable of exciting electromagnetic radiation fields, specifically the creation of whistler waves generated at the VLF range, which are also capable of propagating large distances away from the source region. The mechanism of whistler wave generation is considered a parametric interaction of LOR oscillations excited by conventional loop antenna. The transformation of LOR waves on quasi-neutral density perturbations generated by a dipole antenna operating in the frequency range above an ion cyclotron frequency gives rise to electromagnetic whistler waves on combination frequencies. In this approach extended plasma volume around a loop antenna represents a parametric antenna. Simulation to demonstrate excitation and spatial structure of VLF waves excited by a loop antenna using a PIC code LSP will be presented as well. Possible applications including the wave-particle interactions to mitigate performance anomalies of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, active space experiments, communication via VLF waves, and modification experiments in the ionosphere will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Fine plant roots are short-lived, narrow-diameter roots that play an important role in ecosystem carbon, water, and nutrient cycling in biomes ranging from the tundra to the tropics. Root ecologists make measurements at a millimeter scale to answer a question with global implications: In response to a changing climate, how do fine roots modulate the exchange of carbon between soils and the atmosphere and how will this response affect our future climate? In a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment in Oak Ridge, TN, elevated [CO2] caused fine roots to dive deeper into the soil profile in search of limiting nitrogen, which led to increased soil C storage in deep soils. In contrast, the fine roots of trees and shrubs in an ombrotrophic bog are constrained to nutrient-poor, oxic soils above the average summer water table depth, though this may change with warmer, drier conditions. Tundra plant species are similarly constrained to surface organic soils by permafrost or waterlogged soils, but have many adaptations that alter ecosystem C fluxes, including aerenchyma that oxygenate the rhizosphere but also allow direct methane flux to the atmosphere. FRED, a global root trait database, will allow terrestrial biosphere models to represent the complexity of root traits across the globe, informing both model representation of ecosystem C and nutrient fluxes, but also the gaps where measurements are needed on plant-soil interactions (for example, in the tropical biome). While the complexity of mm-scale measurements may never have a place in large-scale global models, close collaboration between empiricists and modelers can help to guide the scaling of important, yet small-scale, processes to quantify their important roles in larger-scale ecosystem fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The fast spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) between 11°N and 14°N is characterized by several discontinuities. Previous work suggests that magmas erupted at ridge discontinuities partially crystallize at higher pressures than magmas erupted along “normal” ridge segments. We have determined the pressures of partial crystallization of erupted magmas using 922 glass analyses compiled from Gale et al., (2013). The results indicate crystallization at a wide range of pressures (1 bar to ~ 700 MPa) over the whole length of this ridge segment with no apparent correlation between pressure and ridge discontinuities. This might indicate that some magmas begin to crystallize in the mantle. Alternatively, the compositions of some magmas have been modified by interaction with preexisting crust so that the calculated pressures may not represent the true pressure of partial crystallization. We compiled geochemical data for 178 whole-rock samples from Gale et al., (2013) to examine the possibility that some magmas have interacted with oceanic crust. We found no systematic changes in composition with latitude or ridge discontinuities, and values of Na8 suggest near-constant degrees of melting at near constant temperature in the mantle beneath the ridge. However, normalizing trace element concentrations to the composition of average NMORB reveals that the southern and northern ridge segments have compositions similar to NMORB, although some samples are enriched in highly incompatible elements. In contrast, samples from the middle segment are depleted in highly incompatible elements relative to NMORB. The simplest interpretation is that magmas were ultimately derived from mantle sources variably depleted in highly incompatible elements. Plots of P2O5 and TiO2 versus K2O suggest that crystallization was not the only process occurring in the crust, and some magmas assimilated preexisting oceanic crust during ascent. This suggests the possibility that all magmas were ultimately derived from a mantle source depleted in incompatible elements relative to NMORB, but that some magmas became enriched in incompatible elements through interaction with the crust. Further studies will test this hypothesis, and seek an explanation for the high pressures of partial crystallization calculated for magmas erupted along the EPR.",

The wide dynamic range, the high temporal resolution, and the use of two different ion source configurations of the NGIMS instrument [Mahaffy et al., 2014] allows neutral density structure and its variability to be characterized in detail. Large amplitude wave structure is observed on the lowest altitude portion of many orbits that dissipates at higher altitudes. Although this structure puts scatter in the retrieval of scale height temperatures these are nevertheless robustly secured by averaging over several orbits. The variability of the upper atmosphere temperature with latitude and local solar time is reported.

For approximation of probability distributions and estimation of extreme flux values Modified Fisher-Tippett (MFT) distribution has been used. Besides mean flux values, consideration is given to the comparative analysis of (i) parameters of the MFT probability density functions (scale and location), (ii) extreme flux values corresponding high order percentiles of fluxes (e.g. 99th and higher) and (iii) fractional contribution of extreme surface flux events in the total surface turbulent fluxes integrated over months and seasons. The latter was estimated using both fractional distribution derived from MFT and empirical estimates based upon occurrence histograms. The strongest differences in the parameters of probability distributions of surface fluxes and extreme surface flux values between different reanalyses are found in the western boundary current extension regions and high latitudes, while the highest differences in the fractional contributions of surface fluxes may occur in mid ocean regions being closely associated with atmospheric synoptic dynamics. Generally, satellite surface flux products demonstrate relatively stronger extreme fluxes compared to reanalyses, even in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes where data assimilation input in reanalyses is quite dense compared to the Southern Ocean regions. Our assessment also discriminated different reanalyses and satellite products with respect to their ability to quantify the role of extreme surface turbulent fluxes in forming ocean heat release in different regions.",

In addition, a flow shear across the reconnection site in the plane of the reconnecting magnetic field can be caused by magnetosheath flow, especially at higher latitudes. Being able to predict the solar wind’s effect on reconnection is important for understanding, e.g., solar wind-magnetospheric coupling. Recently, we showed that flow shear during asymmetric reconnection causes the reconnection site to convect in the outflow direction, predicted the flow speed from momentum conservation, and confirmed the results with two-dimensional two-fluid numerical simulations (Doss et al., J. Geophys. Res., submitted). We also predicted and confirmed with two-fluid simulations the reconnection rate as a function of upstream plasma conditions and the flow shear required to shut reconnection off. Here, we revisit this system using two-dimensional fully electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, which treat plasma mixing in the exhaust more realistically than the fluid model. We find very good agreement between the predictions and PIC simulation results for both the X-line convection speed and the reconnection rate for flow speeds below the cutoff speed. For reconnection with typical conditions at the dayside magnetopause, we predict the reconnection site of isolated X-lines convect at nearly the same speed as the tangential component of the solar wind velocity, and the flow has little effect on the reconnection rate.",

            "abstract": "The use of building vibrations to measure blast wave propagation in a city is examined in this case study. The Exxon Mobil Corp. oil refinery in Torrance, California experienced an explosion on February 18, 2015 causing ground shaking equivalent to a magnitude 1.9 earthquake. The impulse response for the source was computed from Southern California Seismic Network data for a multi-orthogonal force system with a value of 2×105 kN vertically downward. The pressure wave excited by the explosion traveled through the city of Los Angeles, and was detected by a dense accelerometer array in a 52-story building also in downtown Los Angeles 22.8 km from the explosion. The array is part of the Community Seismic Network (CSN) and consists of three-component class-C MEMs sensors located on each floor of the building. The detection was verified by the nearly simultaneous arrival times of acceleration pulses on multiple floors of the building, corresponding to an average wave speed near the speed of sound in air.\nThe pressure wave peak magnitude from the air blast was determined using accelerometer data collected on every floor of the building coupled with the elastic response of the structure as a whole. . Making use of high-fidelity finite element modeling of the building validated by previous low-level seismicity and ambient noise data, a procedure is outlined for pressure wave detection and quantification on well instrumented buildings. This case study for a 52 story building, instrumented by the CSN, acts as a proxy for blast wave quantification in dense urban environments. This type of information can be used to understand the flow of blast waves through a cityscape as well as enhance procedures for estimating blast source magnitude. Better understanding of the propagation of pressure waves in urban environments will lead to the development of improved countermeasures in those environments.",

            "abstract": "Performance assessment of bridges has become very important during recent years. Bridges around the world are aging, leading to the incorporation of efficient, reliable, and economic evaluation procedures. These techniques must assess properly the performance of bridges under several loading conditions in a real manner, representing the physics of the problem. Among several approaches, Global Positioning System (GPS) can be intelligently used for the performance evaluation of bridges. We focused on GPS, since it naturally produces position estimates as compared to seismic instruments that record either velocity or acceleration, and thus require an integration. There are several reasons that make the Juarez Bridge a case of study for evaluation: it is approximately 45 years old, it is a reinforced concrete structure, it connects two significant zones of the city, and its spans is closely to 200 meters long. In addition, thousands of vehicles and pedestrians use the Juarez Bridge every day, which make feasible the GPS performance assessment. Hence, in order to produce optimal position estimates, GPS data were collected during two consecutive hours at three different periods of the day for a whole week (Monday through Sunday), to represent three critical limit states of the bridge (mid-span and end-spans). GPS data were processed using the GAMIT/GLOBK software, considering 1-second sampling rate, 15-degree cutoff angle, ionosphere-free double-differenced (DD) carrier phase method, and precise final orbits disseminated by IGS (International GNSS Service). The displacements obtained from the above discussed procedure are compared with allowable values documented in bridge construction manuals. Reliability theory was used to evaluate the probability of failure of the bridge for the three periods of the day. In addition, a conclusion was made about the most risky day of the week for the use of the Juarez Bridge. It is expected that the results from the proposed research will provide enough information to document non-permissible movements of the Juarez Bridge. Finally, guidance for future retrofit of the structure will be fully available.",

The science objectives of JUICE is to understand (1) emergence of habitable worlds around gas giants and (2) Jupiter system as an archetype for gas giants. JUICE was mission adopted in November 2014. JUICE will be launched by Arian-5. After 7.5 years of interplanetary transfer and Earth-Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assists JUICE will be inserted into an orbit around Jupiter in January 2030. JUICE will make observation of all the three Jupiter icy Moons that potentially have subsurface ocean under the icy crust. After inserted into Ganymede orbit in 2032, JUICE will make detailed observation of the largest Icy Moon in the solar system. Three Japanese groups were selected to provide part of the three science instruments RPWI, GALA, and PEP/JNA. Two Japanese groups were also selected as science Co-I of two instrument groups JANUS and J-MAG. JUICE is the first mission for ISAS/JAXA to participate to foreign large science mission as a junior partner who will provide part of the science instruments. Taking into account all the data to be obtained by 5 instruments that JUICE-JAPAN will participate, Japanese team will be able to contribute to most of the major science objectives relating with planet Jupiter (JANUS), Jupiter magnetosphere (PEP/JNA, RPWI, and J-MAG), and Icy Moons (GALA, J-MAG, and JANUS). JUICE-JAPAN Working Group (WG) was established in September 2013. JUICE-JAPAN WG submitted a proposal for ISAS/JAXA small project in February 2014. JUICE-JAPAN WG passed the MDR in September 2014.

            "abstract": "The observation of dry and wet decades at the regional scale is, in different parts of the world, explained by teleconnections between regional and global climate modes of variability. This decadal variability raises interesting issues, such as the long-term planning of hydropower generation. Indeed, quantifying these teleconnections requires analyzing long series, which are rare and often lacking in remote areas such as Northern Canada, where some of the largest hydropower systems in the world are found. In northern Canada, no meteorological station close to any large dam has more than 50 years of data. These few decades of observations are not sufficient to adequately study multi-decadal hydrological variability and teleconnections. To cope with this issue, several reconstructions methodologies have been proposed, using for example natural proxies (e.g. tree-ring). Here, we applied a reconstruction methodology based on an historical atmospheric reanalysis on several Canadian catchments, to produce daily streamflow series. These series were then used to study teleconnections at the catchment-scale over the 1851-2011 period.\nFirstly, a climatic reconstruction method (ANATEM) was applied, resulting in an ensemble of daily climatic series for each studied catchment. These ensembles were obtained by resampling the observed catchment climatic series based on both season and similarity of geopotential height fields. The NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis ensemble has been used to estimate similarities between daily geopotential fields over the 1851-2011 period. Secondly, a hydrological model was used to transform the climatic ensembles into streamflow ensembles. The studied catchments are located in two different - and distant - Canadian regions (British-Columbia and Québec provinces), allowing quantifying potential teleconnections with different climatic modes of variability, such as the NAO, ENSO or the PDO for each region. Thus, correlations between the variability of the reconstructed streamflow series and the different climate indices have been estimated at the decadal scale, for each studied catchment. Finally, the high temporal resolution of the applied reconstruction method (daily time-step) allowed studying the variability and teleconnection of seasonal streamflows over the past 160 years.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity is a key concept that integrates longitudinal transport in rivers with vertical and lateral exchanges between rivers and hyporheic zones, riparian wetlands, floodplains, and ponded aquatic ecosystems. Desirable levels of connectivity are thought to be associated with rivers that are well-connected longitudinally while also being well connected vertically and laterally with marginal waters where carbon and nutrients are efficiently transformed, and where aquatic organisms feed, or are reared, or take refuge during floods. But what is the proper balance between longitudinal and vertical and lateral connectivity? We took a step towards quantifying hydrologic connectivity using the model NEXSS (Gomez-Velez and Harvey, 2014, GRL) applied throughout the nation’s rivers. NEXSS simulates vertical and lateral connectivity and compares it with longitudinal transport along the river’s main axis. It uses as inputs measured network topology for first to eighth order channels, river hydraulic geometry, sediment grain size, bedform types and sizes, estimated hydraulic conductivity of sediments, and estimates of reaction rates such as denitrification. Results indicate that hyporheic flow is large enough to exchange a river’s entire volume many times within a river network, which increases biogeochemical opportunities for nutrient processing and attenuation of contaminants. Also, the analysis demonstrated why and where (i.e., in which physiographic regions of the nation) are hyporheic flow and solute reactions the greatest. The cumulative influence of hydrologic connectivity on water quality is expressed by a dimensionless index of reaction significance. Our quantification of hydrologic connectivity adds a physical basis that supports water quality modeling, and also supports scientifically based prioritization of management actions (e.g. stream restoration) and may support other types of actions (e.g. legislative actions) to help conserve healthy functional rivers with proper levels of stream metabolism and diverse food webs. The NEXSS model will be modified to account for variable flow (baseflow to bankfull) and to account for exchange that occurs with overbank flooding of riparian wetlands and floodplains.",

            "abstract": "Both Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) and optical imagery play a pivotal role in many applications. Thus it is desirable to fuse the two independent sources of data congruously. Many of the fusion methods, however, fail to consider the different nature of SAR and optical data. Moreover, it is not straightforward to adjust the contribution of the two data sources with respect to the application. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the classification methods which can provide the possibility of combination of two kinds of images considering the different nature of them. It is particularly useful when object-based classification is used, in which case features extracted from SAR and optical images can be treated differently.\nThis paper aims to develop an object-based classification method using both optical and SAR data which treats the two data sources independently. For the implementation of the method, a RapidEye and a RADARSAT-2 Quad-polarimetric image over Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland, Canada will be used for wetland classification. RapidEye will be segmented using multiresolution algorithm in eCognitionTM. Because of speckle, segmentation of SAR images does not have robust results. Thus the result of the segmentation from RapidEye image is superimposed on RADARSAT-2 image. Then useful SAR and optical features are extracted. Integrating features extracted from optical and SAR data, a compound kernel in SVM is applied for classification. This kernel is a combination of two kernels with different weights, each of which are for the features of one of the data sources. Using compound kernel can outperform using the same kernel for both images.\nThe proposed method has two main advantages. First, different nature of optical and SAR images which is the result of dissimilar dynamic range, resolution, etc. is considered. Second, as the two data sources are combined with different weights, it is possible to adjust the role of each data sources for varying applications.",

            "abstract": "Limited computational resources typically limit the spatial resolution of watershed-scale hydrologic-biogeochemical models, thus necessitating the upscaling of topographic, biotic, and abiotic parameters. Upscaled models, however, may not capture nonlinear interactions between processes accurately, leading to significant biases in the solutions. In this presentation, we consider a sampling-based scaling approach that maps coarse-resolution solutions to the high-resolution solutions. The approach, called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Mapping Method (PODMM), trains a reduced order model with coarse- and fine- solutions, here obtained using a high-resolution watershed-scale model. The model, PAWS+CLM, is a quasi-3D watershed model that has been validated against observations in many temperate watersheds; here we applied PAWS+CLM to construct coarse- (7 km) and fine- (200m) resolution simulations for the Clinton River basin in Michigan, USA. After the training stage, subsequent fine-resolution solutions were approximated based only on coarse-resolution solutions and the ROM, leading to significant computational speedup. We demonstrate that fine-resolution soil moisture, latent heat flux, and net primary production are accurately reproduced, with up to 80% bias reduction compared to solutions obtained using coarse-resolution model. In addition, the subgrid distributions of the ROM solutions closely resemble those obtained using the fine-resolution model. This method can potentially bridge the intrinsic difference in scales between different processes by allowing efficient upscaling and downscaling of spatial solutions.",

            "abstract": "River water moves in and out of the main channel along pathways that are perpendicular to the channel’s main axis that flow across or beneath the ground surface. These hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) are difficult to measure, yet no less important than a river’s downstream flow, or exchanges with the atmosphere and deeper groundwater (Harvey and Gooseff, 2015, WRR). There are very few comprehensive investigations of exchange fluxes to understand patterns with river size and relative importance of specific types of exchanges. We used the physically based model NEXSS to simulate multiple scales of hyporheic flow and their cumulative effects on solute reaction in large basins (on the order of Chesapeake Bay basin or larger). Our goal was to explain where and when particular types of hyporheic flow are important in enhancing key biogeochemical reactions, such as organic carbon respiration and denitrification. Results demonstrate that hyporheic flux (expressed per unit area of streambed) varies surprisingly little across the continuum of first-order streams to eighth-order rivers, and vertical exchange beneath small bedforms dominates in comparison with lateral flow beneath gravel bars and meanders. Also, the river’s entire volume is exchanged many times with hyporheic flow within a basin, and the turnover length (after one entire river volume is exchanged) is strongly influenced by hydrogeomorphic differences between physiographic regions as well as by river size. The cumulative effects on biogeochemical reactions were assessed using a the reaction significance factor, RSF, which computes the cumulative potential for hyporheic reactions using a dimensionless index that balances reaction progress in a single hyporheic flow path against overall processing efficiency of river turnover through hyporheic flow paths of that type. Reaction significance appears to be strongly dominated by hydrologic factors rather than biogeochemical factors, and seems to be dominated by vertical exchange beneath small bedforms throughout river networks. Future implementations of NEXSS will expand the model to consider flow variation and to consider HEFs beyond hyporheic flow to include exchange with marginal surface waters such as riparian wetlands, floodplains, and ponded water.",

These planetary waves are typically excited by diabatic or orographic forcing and can be subject to considerable downstream modification. Due to differences in wave properties, including vertical structure, phase speed and group velocity, Rossby waves exhibit a wide range of behaviors. Here we demonstrate the combined effects of eastward propagating stationary barotropic Rossby waves and westward propagating very low zonal wavenumber stationary barotropic Rossby waves on the atmospheric response to wintertime El Niño convective forcing over the tropical Pacific. Experiments are conducted using the Community Atmospheric Model 4.0 in which both diabatic forcing over the Pacific and localized relaxation outside the forcing region are applied. The localized relaxation is used to dampen Rossby wave propagation to either the west or east of the forcing region and isolate the alternate direction signal. Wave responses match theoretical expectations and clarify that observed downstream stationary responses to diabatic forcing result from the superposition of planetary wave signals emanating in alternate directions.",

The question addressed is how these different pathways each contribute to the total amount of return flow and the dynamics behind them. We used time-lapse ERT measurements in combination with an ensemble of ERT and seismic lines to answer this question via (1) capturing the process of gradual fragmentation of aqueous environments in the vadose zone during drying stages at field scale; (2) characterization of the formation of preferential flow paths from infiltrating wetting fronts during wetting cycles at field scale. The time-lapse ERT provides the possibility to capture the dynamic processes involved during the occurrence of finger flow or macro-pores when an intensive wetting period during flood irrigation occurs. It elucidates the dynamics of retention in the vadose zone during drying and wetting periods at field scale. This method provides thereby a link to upscale from laboratory experiments to field scale and watershed scale for finger flow and preferential flow paths and illustrates the hysteresis behavior at field scale.",

            "abstract": "To increase our understanding of the slow-spreading, equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), we deployed an array of eight autonomous hydrophones centered on the ridge axis between ~20°N and ~10°S. The hydrophones were deployed for 2+ years (500 Hz sample rate) and obtained a continuous record of the regional seismicity. This region is especially interesting for many reasons. A strongly segmented MAR is offset by some of the longest transform faults in the global oceans. In addition, the North America-South America-Africa (NA-SA-AF) triple junction is thought to be between 10°N and 20°N at the MAR, but its exact location is not well-defined. And finally, the NA-SA plate boundary is not clearly delineated by teleseismicity or prominent seafloor structures despite known relative motion between the plates. Seven of the eight hydrophones were recovered in January 2015 and earthquake location analysis is underway. These seismic data will be used to understand the modes of spreading, short-term earthquake predictability, and triple junction dynamics. In particular, we will use patterns in the earthquake data to address the following: 1) Whether long-lived detachment faults play a central role in accretion at the equatorial MAR similar to what is observed to the north (Escartin et al., 2008). 2) Whether foreshock sequences can be used to predict (retrospectively) earthquakes with magnitudes ≥ 5.4 mb on equatorial Atlantic transform faults as they can be on Pacific transforms (McGuire et al., 2005). A total of eighteen teleseismic earthquakes ≥ 5.4 mb occurred in this region during the hydrophone deployment providing a robust data base to test this foreshock precursor hypothesis. 3) Lastly, whether or not the geometry and crustal stress patterns induced by the NA-SA-AF triple junction are apparent in the earthquake data. If so, the earthquake patterns will help improve our understanding of triple junction dynamics and overall lithospheric strength.",

            "abstract": "Consistent comparisons of the amount of land required for different electricity generation technologies are challenging because land use associated with fossil fuel acquisition and delivery has not been well characterized or empirically grounded. This research focuses on improving estimates of the life cycle land use of natural gas-fired electricity (m2/MWh generated) through the novel combination of inventories of natural gas-related infrastructure, satellite imagery analysis and gas production estimates. We focus on seven counties that represent 98% of the total gas production in the Barnett Shale (Texas), evaluating over 500 sites across five life cycle stages (gas production, gathering, processing, transmission, and power generation as well as produced water disposal). We find that a large fraction of total life cycle land use is related to gathering (midstream) infrastructure, particularly pipelines; access roads related to all stages also contribute a large life cycle share. Results were sensitive to several inputs, including well lifetime, pipeline right of way, number of wells per site, variability of heat rate for electricity generation, and facility lifetime. Through this work, we have demonstrated a novel, highly-resolved and empirical method for estimating life cycle land use from natural gas infrastructure in an important production region. When replicated for other gas production regions and other fuels, the results can enable more empirically-grounded and robust comparisons of the land footprint of alternative energy choices.",

            "abstract": "One concern related to GCS is possible risk of unintended CO2 leakage from the storage formations into overlying potable aquifers on underground sources of drinking water (USDW). Here we present a series of field tests conducted in an alluvial aquifer which is on a river terrace at The University of Texas Brackenridge Field Laboratory. Several shallow groundwater wells were completed to the limestone bedrock at a depth of 6 m and screened in the lower 3 m. Core sediments recovered from the shallow aquifer show that the sediments vary in grain size from clay-rich layers to coarse sandy gravels.\nTwo main types of field tests were conducted at the BFL: single- (or double-) well push-pull test and pulse-like CO2 release test. A single- (or double-) well push-pull test includes three phases: the injection phase, the resting phase and pulling phase. During the injection phase, groundwater pumped from the shallow aquifer was stored in a tank, equilibrated with CO2 gasand then injected into the shallow aquifer to mimic CO2 leakage. During the resting phase, the groundwater charged with CO2 reacted with minerals in the aquifer sediments. During the pulling phase, groundwater was pumped from the injection well and groundwater samples were collected continuously for groundwater chemistry analysis. In such tests, large volume of groundwater which was charged with CO2 can be injected into the shallow aquifer and thus maximize contact of groundwater charged with CO2. Different than a single- (or double-) well push-pull test, a pulse-like CO2 release test for validating chemical sensors for CO2 leakage detection involves a CO2 release phase that CO2 gas was directly bubbled into the testing well and a post monitoring phase that groundwater chemistry was continuously monitored through sensors and/or grounder sampling.\nResults of the single- (or double-) well push-pull tests conducted in the shallow aquifer shows that the unintended CO2 leakage could lead to dissolution of carbonates and some silicates and mobilization of heavy metals from the aquifer sediments to groundwater, however, such mobilization posed no risks on groundwater quality at this site. The pulse-like tests have demonstrated it is plausible to use chemical sensors for CO2 leakage detection in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial water storage (TWS) consists of groundwater, soil moisture, snow and ice, lakes and rivers and water contained in biomass. The water storage, especially the subsurface storage, is an essential property of the catchment, which controls climate, hydrological and biogeochemical processes at different scales. During the past decades, climate and land cover change has been proved to exert significant influences on hydrological processes which in turn alters the TWS variation. In order to better understand the interaction and feedback mechanism between TWS and earth system, it is necessary to quantify the effects of climate and land cover change on TWS variation. Direct estimation of total TWS has been made possible by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites that measures the earth gravity field. At present, few efforts were made to explicitly investigate the TWS variation under changing climate and land cover. GRACE data has its own limitations. One is its temporal coverage is short, it’s only available since 2002, which is not sufficient to reflect the trend due to climate and land cover change. The other reason is that it cannot distinguish different components contributing to TWS.\nThe limitation of TWS observation data can be overcame by numerical models developed to reproduce or to predict different earth system processes. After calibration and validation, with limited observations, these models can be trusted to extend our knowledge to where observations are not available both in time and space. In this study, based on Noah-MP LSM and satellite and ground data, we aim to:\n(1) Investigate the variation of total TWS as well as its components over Upper Colorado River Basin from 1990 to 2014.\n(2) Identify the major factors that control the TWS variation.\n(3) Quantify how the changing climate and land cover affect TWS variation in the same period.",

            "abstract": "Currently, the Noah Land-Surface Model (Noah-LSM) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model does not have a representation of the physical behavior of a karst terrain found in a large area of Tennessee and Kentucky and 25% of land area worldwide. The soluble nature of the bedrock within a karst geologic terrains allows for the formation of caverns, joints, fissures, sinkholes, and underground streams which affect the hydrological behavior of the region. The Highland Rim of Tennessee and the Pennyroyal Plateau and Bluegrass region of Kentucky make up a larger karst area known as the Interior Low Plateau. The highly weathered upper portion of the karst terrain, known as the epikarst, allows for more rapid transport of water through the system. For this study, hydrological aspects, such as bedrock porosity and the hydraulic conductivity, were chosen within this region in order to determine the most representative subsurface parameters for the Noah-LSM. These values along with the use of similar proxy values were chosen to calculate and represent the remaining eight parameters within the SOILPARM.TBL for the WRF model.\nHydraulic conductivity values show a variation ranging from around 10-7 and 10-5 ms-1 for the karst bedrock within this region. A sand and clay soil type was used along with bedrock parameters to determine an average soil parameter type for the epikarst bedrock located within this region. Results from this study show parameters for an epikarst bedrock type displaying higher water transport through the system, similar to that of a sandy soil type with a water retention similar to that of a loam type soil. The physical nature of epikarst may lead to a decrease in latent heat values over this region and increase sensible heat values. This, in turn, may effect boundary layer growth which could lead to convective development. Future modeling work can be conducted using these values by way of coupling the soil parameters with the karst regions of the Tennessee/Kentucky area.",

            "abstract": "A new synthesis of 10 study areas and >480 14C dates of Holocene fire and erosional response are recorded in alluvial fan sediments of the interior western US. Chronologies are from high elevation mixed conifer forests in the N. Rockies, ponderosa and Douglas-fir forests in the N. Rockies and SW, and low elevation sagebrush steppe and piñon-juniper woodlands near the Snake River Plain. Results are as follows: 1) Late Holocene arrivals of ponderosa, lodgepole and piñon pine at Northern Rockies sites correspond with increased fire severity, linking vegetation and fire regime changes. 2) Deposit types vary with environment; sheetfloods are more common in sparsely vegetated sites and in drier Holocene periods with open forests, whereas dense forests and infrequent severe fires often produce debris flows. 3) Climate variability drives ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests in both the SW and N. Rockies to burn ‘at both ends of the spectrum’, where frequent low-severity fires are typical, but higher-severity fires burn during severe droughts following fuel buildup over wet decades. 4) Fires in dry sage steppe are generally fuel-limited, but burn during prolonged wet and variable climates; grazing, land-use, and invasive species, particularly influence modern fires. 5) At moist high-elevation lodgepole and mixed conifer sites in Yellowstone and central Idaho, episodic large debris flows indicate high severity burns, often during severe multidecadal droughts. 6) Regionally coherent peaks exist ca. 200, 500, 900, 1700 and 2600 cal yr BP, but fire activity is not generally synchronous among sites. Differences in climate among sites likely account for some asynchroneity. 7) Recent severe fires have burned in 8 of 10 sites described; erosional response appears particularly anomalous in the SW, where impacts of fire suppression and land use are greatest. Widespread and severe modern fires may herald the arrival of a no-analog era of fire in the western US.",

            "abstract": "The Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) is a left-lateral, strike-slip fault that forms the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and plays a significant role in accommodating the convergence between the colliding Indian and Eurasian plates. As a part of the fourth phase of the INDEPTH project, magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected across the central segment of the ATF to determine the lithospheric-scale structure of the fault system. Dimensionality analyses demonstrated that the MT data can be interpreted using two-dimensional approaches, but some localized 3-D effects are seen. Consequently, both 2-D and 3-D inversions were carried out, and a joint interpretation was made on the basis of these two types of models. Inversion models revealed two major conductors beneath the Qaidam Basin (QB) and Altyn Tagh Range (ATR), respectively. The conductive region beneath the QB was interpreted as a ductile layer in the lower crust to upper mantle that might represent flow beneath the western margin of the QB, whereas the large scale south-dipping conductor beneath the ATR is interpreted as a region with high fluid content formed by metamorphism associated with the oblique underthrusting of the Tarim Block beneath the northern Tibetan Plateau. These fluids migrate upward through the fault system and have formed serpentinized zones in the crust. Combining these interpretations, a structural model compatible with diverse geophysical observations is proposed, in which we suggest the competing end-member rigid block model and continuum model are reconcilable with the continuum model locally dominant for the study region, as evidenced by a thickened crust.\n* This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41404060, 40974058, 40904025) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2652014016).\n",

While in-situ measurements can give the highest quality of information on a site-specific basis, the vast permafrost terrains of North America and Eurasia require space-based techniques for assessments of cause and effect and long-term changes and impacts from the changes of permafrost and the active-layer. Satellite-based 6.925 and 10.65 GHz sensor algorithmic retrievals of soil moisture by Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observation System (AMSR-E) onboard NASA-Aqua and follow-on AMSR2 onboard JAXA-Global Change Observation Mission – Water-1 are ongoing since July 2002. Accurate land-surface temperature and vegetation parameters are critical to the success of passive microwave algorithmic retrieval schemes. Strategically located soil moisture measurements are needed for spatial and temporal co-location evaluation and validation of the space-based algorithmic estimates. We compare on a daily basis ground-based (subsurface-probe) 50- and 70-MHz radio-frequency soil moisture measurements with NASA- and JAXA-algorithmic retrieval passive microwave retrievals. We find improvements in performance of the JAXA-algorithm (AMSR-E reprocessed and AMSR2 ongoing) relative to the earlier NASA-algorithm version. In the boreal forest regions accurate land-surface temperatures and vegetation parameters are still needed for algorithmic retrieval success. Over the period of AMSR-E retrievals we find evidence of at the high northern latitudes of growing terrestrial radio-frequency interference in the 10.65 GHz channel soil moisture content.

Simplifying the river bed geometries could reduce both the computational burden implementing flow simulations and challenges in assembling the required data, especially for large domains. Average flow conditions expressed as empirical “at-a-station” hydraulic geometry relationships between key channel components, (i.e. water depth, top-width, flow velocity, flow area against discharge) have been studied since 60's. Recent works demonstrated that power-function as idealized riverbed geometry whose parameters are correlated to those of exponential relationship between mean water depth and top-width, are consistent with empirical \"at-a-station\" relations.\nUS Geological Surveys' National Water Information System web-interface provides huge amount of river discharge and corresponding stage height data from several thousands of streamflow monitoring stations over United States accompanied by river survey summaries providing additional flow informations (width, mean velocity, cross-sectional area). We conducted a series of analyses to indentify consistent data daily monitoring and corresponding survey records that are suitable to refine our current understanding of how the \"at-a-station\" properties of river channels relate to channel forming characteristics (e.g. riverbed slope, flow regime, geology, etc.). The resulting ~1,200 actively operating USGS stations with over ~225,000 corresponding survery records (almost 200 survey per gauge on average) is the largest river survey database ever studied in the past.\nOur presentation will show our process assembling our river monitoring and survey data base and we will present our first results translating \"at-a-station\" relations into he hydraulic geometry of river channels based on idealized power-law riverbed geometries. We also will also present a series of application (e.g. improved flow rounting, simplyfied river surveying).",

            "abstract": "A regional assessment of historical and future yields, and components of the water, nitrogen, and carbon soil balance of dryland wheat-based cropping systems in the US Pacific Northwest is being conducted (Regional Approaches to Climate Change project funded by USDA-NIFA). All these elements intertwines and are important to understand the future of these systems in the region. A computer simulation methodology was used based on the CropSyst model and historic and projected daily weather data downscaled to a 4x4 km grid including 14 general circulation models (GCMs) and two representative concentration pathways of future atmospheric CO2 (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The study region was divided in 3 agro-ecological zones (AEZ) based on precipitation amount: low (<300 mm/year), intermediate (300-460 mm/year) and high (>460 mm/year), with a change from crop-fallow, to transition fallow (crop-crop-fallow) to annual cropping, respectively. Typical wheat-based rotations included winter wheat (WW)-Summer fallow (SF) for the low AEZ, WW-spring wheat (SW)-SF for the intermediate AEZ, and WW-SW-spring peas for the high AEZ, all under conventional and no tillage management. Alternative systems incorporating canola were also evaluated. Results suggest that, in most cases, these dryland systems may fare well in the future (31-year periods centered around 2030, 2050, and 2070), with potential gains in productivity. Also, a trend towards increased fallow in the intermediate AEZ appears possible for higher productivity, and the inclusion of less water demanding crops may help sustain cropping intensity. Uncertainties in these projections arise from large discrepancies among climate models regarding the warming rate, compounded by different possible future CO2 emission scenarios, the degree of change in frequency and severity of extreme events and associated potential damages to crop canopies due to cold weather and grain set reduction due to extreme heat events. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the impact of climate change on pests, diseases and weeds that could affect crop production and management costs. Finally, there is also uncertainty on the speed of technological innovation allowing producers to adapt to changing conditions.",

            "abstract": "Trends of all-sky downward surface shortwave radiation (SSR) from high-spatial resolution satellite-derived data over Europe from 1983 to 2010 are first presented. The results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) brightening in the major part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of around 2 Wm-2 per decade over the whole Europe, which, taking into account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can be related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe. The reported increase in SSR is slightly lower than the obtained using high-quality ground-based series over Europe. Secondly, clear-sky SSR estimates have been derived as the result of the difference between ground-based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data (i.e., this latter lacking direct aerosol effects). The results highlight that these residual series can be useful to estimate clear-sky SSR trends, pointing to a significant increase during the period 1983-2010, with higher rates of around 2 Wm-2 per decade over central and eastern Europe. This increase in clear-sky SSR is mainly due to a strong increase from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, possibly linked to a decrease in anthropogenic emissions and a recovery from the El Chichón and Pinatubo volcanic eruptions. These results are in line with observations and other estimates of clear-sky SSR (e.g., by making use of sunshine duration records), as well as reported anthropogenic aerosol emissions and concentrations in Europe. Overall, from the results of this study it can be concluded that around one third of the brightening trend in Europe from 1983 to 2010 can be explained by direct aerosol effects, whereas the other two third is related to clouds, i.e. via changes in natural cloud variability and/or aerosol indirect effect on clouds.",

Phosphorus (P) is a pollutant that is particularly susceptible to these types of events, as P is often disproportionately transported in overland runoff. While the benefit of avoiding the intersection of manure and runoff is unmistakable, it is less clear what length of time is needed between manure application and runoff, and also, what types of predictions can be most effective (i.e. what is the benefit of runoff predictions over simple rain predictions?). In this study, we model the effect of prediction type and avoidance window size on resultant P export.

            "abstract": "The 2004 M6 Parkfield Ca earthquake was preceded by a four-year period of anomalously high seismicity adjacent to, but not on, the San Andreas Fault. The rate of small events at distances between 1.5 and 20 km from the fault plane and at depths greater than 8 km increased from 6 events/yr prior 2000 to 20 events/yr between 2000 and the 2004 earthquake. This increase in seismicity coincided with an increase in non-volcanic tremor, which, if tremor is indicative of creep on the fault plane, suggests that creep may have driven the enhanced seismicity. A causal relation between creep at the base of the fault zone and off-fault seismicity is supported by Coulomb stress transfer calculations that predict the observed spatial pattern of the seismicity. In particular, an observed SE striking lineation of enhanced seismicity is shown to be a direct consequence of a deepening brittle-ductile transition SE of Parkfield, as evidenced by a deepening of the tremor and low-frequency earthquakes. The observation that off-fault seismicity before and after the 2004 earthquake occurred in the same location suggests that the foreshocks are driven by an episode of deep creep and the aftershocks are driven by after slip, both occurring on the same deep extension of the fault plane. Finally, a transient increase in off-fault seismicity was observed to follow the 2010 Maule and the 2011 Tohuku earthquakes. Since the seismic waves from these events were observed to trigger tremor at Parkfield, this observation can be taken as further evidence for a causal link between deep creep and off-fault seismicity, particularly since the increase in off-fault seismicity was limited to deep events having the same spatial pattern as those that preceded the 2004 earthquakes. A similar anomaly in on-fault seismicity between 1990 and 1994 did not show any evidence of anomalous off-fault seismicity, and did not culminate in a M6 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The field of research aiming at recovering meaningful measurements of sea level and significant wave height from satellite altimetry in the coastal strip, known as coastal altimetry, has reached maturity thanks to the concerted effort of a lively community of scientists (\nwww.coastalt.eu/community\n).\nWe illustrate the improvements in radar waveform retracking, as well as those in the corrections of atmospheric and surface effects, that together enable coastal altimetry to achieve a precision comparable to the 2-cm level at 1-Hz seen over the open ocean. We present design and implementation of a multi-mission coastal altimetry processor based on the ALES retracking algorithm that has been used to generate products from the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Envisat altimeters in the 50-km coastal band globally; these products are freely available.\nWe show examples of the validation of satellite altimetry data against tide gauges and wave buoys in dynamically different regions of the world’s coasts (Northern Adriatic, UK coast, South Africa, South-East Australia). We demonstrate the intrinsically superior performance of SAR mode (delay-Doppler) altimetry from ESA Cryosat-2 mission, showing measurement noise of around 5 cm or lower for the 20-Hz data almost all the way to the coast when the orientation of the satellite track is favourable. This is extremely promising for the Sentinel-3 altimeter, due for launch in late 2015, which will be in SAR mode everywhere.\nWe finally illustrate with examples two very different applications of the reprocessed data, both having significant societal impact: a) the observation of the offshore-to-coast sea level profile during extreme events (storm surges), which is of great value to surge modellers and forecasters; and b) the use of long (>20 years) time series of coastal altimetry to derive the rates of global and regional sea level rise in the coastal strip, therefore enabling a link between the open-ocean estimates and those from tide gauges.",

            "abstract": "The stratification of the deep ocean plays a key role in the climate system by influencing the ocean circulation and regulating the outgassing of CO2. Previous studies have suggested that Southern Ocean processes control the global ocean stratification below the main thermocline (i.e., below ~500m). In this study, three ocean-only simulations are carried out with the Community Earth System Model (CESM1): one control simulation forced with Pre-industrial (PI) surface conditions, a second control simulation forced with Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) surface conditions, and a test simulation forced with LGM surface conditions in southern high latitudes and PI surface conditions elsewhere. We find that the test simulation does broadly reproduce the LGM density stratification of the global ocean below 2000m, but not at intermediate depths between 500m and 1500m. We propose a mechanism whereby the stratification of the intermediate-depth waters is influenced by the differing effects on the surface buoyancy distribution of fixed versus restoring aspects of the surface buoyancy forcing. This implies the Southern Ocean exerts less influence over the global deep ocean stratification than has been previously suggested, at least when considering the difference between LGM and PI climates in CESM1.",

This acceleration occurs because the ion gyroradius is comparable to the spatial scale of the localized electric field pulse at the leading edge of the earthward-propagating, dipolarizing flux bundles before it stops. The proposed acceleration mechanism can reproduce observed spectra of high-energy ions. We conclude that the electric field associated with dipolarizing flux bundles prior to their stoppage in the inner magnetosphere provides a natural site for intense local ion acceleration.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, the hydrochemistry and geologic characteristics of the shallow groundwater aquifer along Wadi Al Showat, Khamis Mushiet District, Southwest Saudi Arabia was evaluated and assessed. Along this wadi the fractured/weathered basement rocks house significant quantity of groundwater that usually used by local people for agricultural and domestic purposes. Assessing and evaluation of the quality of the groundwater in such shallow aquifers is very important; especially the groundwater is generally occurred within the fractured basement rocks at shallow depths, thus exposing the groundwater to surface or near-surface contaminants is expected. For this purpose hydrochemical and biological analysis was conducted for 25 water samples collected from the available shallow dug wells along the studied wadi. The study reveals that the groundwater quality changed due to the agriculture and urbanization practices along the wadi. The effect of domestic waste water and septic tanks was obvious.\nIn addition, the field investigation indicates that the basement rocks in the area is dissected by two main sets of fractures that oriented in the west-northwest and east-west directions. In some places, the basement rocks is intruded by coarse-grained, quartz-rich quartzite grained monzogranite, and pegmatite veins that have a coarse-grained weathering product, therefore, they tend to develop and preserve open joint systems between the granitic blocks. These fracturing system are important from the hydrogeological point of view, as they facilitate the storage, water flow movement through them and also facilitate the vertical infiltration of the surface pollutants. These results led to a better understanding of the groundwater characteristics that is important in groundwater management in the study area.",

We present a coupled study of mineral major and trace element compositions and deformation microstructures of Wyoming craton peridotites. The peridotite xenoliths were sampled from the Homestead and Williams diatremes in the northwest margin of the Wyoming. Many peridotites bear coexisting garnet and spinel, and range in crystal texture from coarse grained to porphyroclastic and recrystallized. Samples have predominantly harzburgitic mineral abundances while some of the porphyroclastic samples are lherzolitic. Among the samples analyzed, most are depleted with respect to major elements (e.g. olivine Mg# = ~92). However, trace element compositions show significant systematic variations in enrichment, indicating varying degrees and styles of metasomatism among the analyzed sample suite. Primitive-mantle normalized REE patterns in cpx range from hump-shaped to negatively sloped; the former suggests metasomatism at high melt/rock ratios and the latter represents unperturbed subsolidus equilibration with garnet. Compositions indicative of metasomatism generally correspond to samples bearing porphyroclastic, recrystallized textures. Garnet-pyroxene major element thermobarometry constrain final equilibration of the xenoliths to ~4 GPa and 1140-1330ºC, conditions that are significantly above the presumed shield geotherm and agree with previous estimates of lithospheric P-T conditions in this region of the craton. Preliminary REE-in-two-pyroxene temperatures overlap with major element-based temperatures. Crystal-preferred orientations of olivine and pyroxenes will be presented at the meeting, and will be interpreted in conjunction with major and trace element compositional data.",

Speleothems are increasingly used as terrestrial archives of past climate and environmental change because they can provide long, continuous, precisely U-series dated and high-resolution time series, and are generally unaffected by post-depositional diagenetic alteration. The stable isotope record, a proxy primarily for precipitation in the tropics, shows many of the salient features also found in Greenland ice cores, e.g. Heinrich events and the LGM. However, amplitudes, duration and timing of such anomalous periods do not always correspond to those recorded in ice cores. The Holocene shows a drying trend similar to what has been found in other climate archives. Our record will elucidate teleconnections at different time scales between the tropics and higher latitudes, which are highly relevant for the understanding of decadal to multicentennial climate variability and underlying dynamics, and to learn critical aspects of reconstructed as well as simulated pre-industrial tropical climate evolution.

The inversion -- termed ``transient calibration'' -- produces an optimal set of time-mean, spatially varying parameters together with a time-evolving state that accounts for the transient nature of observations and the model dynamics. Serving as an optimal initial condition, the estimated state for 2011 is used, with no additional forcing, for predicting grounded ice volume loss and grounding line retreat over the ensuing 30 years. The transiently calibrated model predicts a near-steady loss of grounded ice volume of approximately 21 km3/a over this period, as well as loss of 33 km2/a grounded area. We contrast this prediction with one obtained following a commonly used ``snapshot'' or steady-state inversion, which does not consider time dependence and assumes all observations to be contemporaneous. Transient calibration is shown to achieve a better fit with observations of thinning and grounding line retreat histories, and yields a quantitatively different projection with respect to ice volume loss and ungrounding. Sensitivity studies suggest large near-future levels of unforced, i.e. committed sea level contribution from these ice streams under reasonable assumptions regarding uncertainties of the unknown parameters.",

The Clearinghouse efforts address national priorities outlined in USGS Circular 1242, Plan to Coordinate NEHRP post-earthquake investigations and S. 740–Geospatial Data Act of 2015, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), to streamline and coordinate geospatial data infrastructure, maximizing geospatial data in support of the Robert T. Stafford Act. Finally, the US Dept. of Homeland Security, Geospatial Management Office, recognized Clearinghouse’s data sharing efforts as a Best Practice to be included in the forthcoming 2015 HLS Geospatial Concept of Operations.",

            "abstract": "The Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB) is best known for the major active stratovolcanoes, such as Popocatépetl, Citlaltépetl and Colima. The most common stratovolcanoes in this province are modest-size cones with heights of 800 to 1000 m. Examples are Tequila, Sangangüey, Las Navajas, Culiacán, La Joya, El Zamorano, Temascalcingo and Altamirano; these last two were formed within the Acambay Graben in central MVB. The Acambay graben (20 x 70 km) is 100 km to the NW of Mexico City, with E-W trending seismically active normal faults; in particular the Acambay-Tixmadejé fault related to a mB =7 earthquake in 1912. Within the graben there are many volcanic structures, including calderas, domes, cinder cones and stratovolcanoes; Temascalcingo and Altamirano are the largest, with about 800 and 900 m heights, respectively. Temascalcingo is mostly composed of dacitic lavas and block and ash flow deposits. Includes a 3 x 2.5 km summit caldera and a magmatic sector collapse event with the associated debris avalanche deposit. 14C ages of 37-12 ka correspond to the volcano’s latest phases that produced pyroclastic deposits. A major plinian eruption formed the San Mateo Pumice with an age of <20 Ka. Altamirano volcano is poorly studied; it is andesitic-dacitic, composed of lavas, pyroclastic flow deposits, and pumice fallouts. Morphologically is better preserved than Temascalcingo, and it should be younger. 14C ages of 4.0-2.5 ka were performed in charcoal within pyroclastic flow deposits that apparently were erupted from Altamirano. An undated 3 m thick pumice fallout on the flanks of Altamirano volcano could be also Holocene. It represents a major explosive event. The relatively young ages found in volcanic deposits within the Acambay graben raise the volcanic danger level in this area, originally thought as an inactive volcanic zone. The two major volcanoes, Temascalcingo and Altamirano, should be considered as dormant volcanoes that could restart activity at any time. We thanks grant DGAPA-UNAM-PAPIIT IN-104615.",

            "abstract": "Polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) are high-altitude ice clouds that form in the cold summer mesopause region due to adiabatic cooling caused by an upwelling induced by the global meridional circulation, which is driven by gravity wave dissipation and forcing. Polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSEs) are strong coherent echoes also observed in the polar summer mesosphere and are considered to be related to ionization and the small-scale structure associated with PMCs, with their origins thought to be strongly related. The peak PMSE height can be located slightly below the summer mesopause temperature minimum but above the PMC altitude. Upward propagating atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) are usually considered to be the cause of the wave patterns seen in PMCs. Monitoring PMCs and PMSEs will provide important tools in detecting climate change in the upper atmosphere and a better understanding of the earth-climate system.\nThe science goal I plan to accomplish is to investigate the possibility of a connection between gravity wave perturbation characteristics in PMCs from the AIM (Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) satellite and PMSE structures observed by PANSY (program of the Antarctic Syowa MST/IS radar). Data from the CIPS instrument onboard AIM, PANSY, and AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) will be used. AIM provides a two-dimensional horizontal view of the atmosphere dynamics embedded in PMCs, while PANSY provides a vertical view of PMSEs and gravity waves with high temporal resolution. The combination of AIM and PANSY will provide a three-dimensional view of the atmosphere, AGWs, PMCs and PMSEs. AIRS provides information about AGWs in the stratosphere. Wave analysis of the Fast Fourier Transform or a wavelet analysis will be used to complete the science goal. AIRS will be used to examine how lower atmosphere meteorology may impact the PMC and PMSE structures.",

            "abstract": "Textural equilibrium controls the distribution of the liquid phase in many naturally occurring porous materials such as partially molten rocks and alloys, salt-brine and ice-water systems. In these materials, pore geometry evolves to minimize the solid-liquid interfacial energy while maintaining a constant dihedral angle, θ, at solid–liquid contact lines. A characteristic of texturally equilibrated porous media, in the absence of deformation, is that the pore network percolates at any porosity for θ<60° while a percolation threshold exists for θ>60°. However, in ductile polycrystalline materials including rock salt, the balance between surface tension and ductile deformation controls the percolation of fluid pockets along grain corners and edges. Here we show sufficiently rapid deformation can overcome this threshold by elongating and connecting isolated pores by examining a large number of accessible salt samples from deep water Gulf of Mexico. We first confirm the percolation threshold in static laboratory experiments on synthetic salt samples with X-ray microtomography. We then provide field evidence on existence of interconnected pore space in rock salt in extremely low porosities, significantly below the static percolation threshold. Scaling arguments suggest that strain rates in salt are sufficient to overcome surface tension and may allow percolation. We also present the first level-set computations of three-dimensional texturally equilibrated melt networks in realistic rock fabrics. The resulting pore space is used to obtain the effective physical properties of rock, effective electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, with a novel numerical model.",

            "abstract": "The characterization of the tectonic framework of Paleozoic terrains is crucial for the investigation of unconventional fractured volcanic reservoirs. In recent years, the need for exploitation of these areas showed the value of the non-seismic methods in Brazil. Here we present the results of a magnetotelluric imaging (MT) to identify and characterize the structural framework of the southern portion of the Paraná Basin, southern Brazil. We carried out a SW-NE ,1200 km-long MT profile, with 68 stations spaced between 5-15 km on the southernmost states in Brazil. The observation of the PSI profile highlights the presence of large scale NW-SE faults and emphasize the presence of two major regional structures: (i) the Rio Grande Arc in the southern portion, and (ii) the Torres Syncline in the northern portion. The Rio Grande Arc is a horst highlighted by the basement uplift and the thicker layers of sedimentary rocks in the extremes south and north of this structure. The fault system observed along the profile suggests simultaneously uplifting of the basement and deposition of the sedimentary sequences of the Paraná Basin. This hypothesis is in agreement with stratigraphic, borehole and geochronological data, which have shown that the Rio Grande arc is contemporaneous with the deposition of the Triassic to Early Jurassic sediments. The Torres Syncline is a structure characterized by the increasing thickness of sedimentary layers in the north section of our MT profile. The continuity of the layers is interrupted by large regional fault systems, which also affect the volcanic rocks of the Serra Geral Formation, indicating that the faults were active after the Cretaceous. The results show that the MT modeling brings a distinct contribution to the understanding of the present structural architecture of the Paraná basin and the construction of a model for potential fractured volcanic reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Pore-scale processes mediated by microorganisms underlie a range of critical ecosystem services, regulating carbon stability, nutrient flux, and the purification of water. Advances in cultivation-independent approaches now provide us with the ability to reconstruct thousands of genomes from microbial populations from which functional roles may be assigned. With this capability to reveal microbial metabolic potential, the next step is to put these microbes back where they belong to interact with their natural environment, i.e. the pore scale. At this scale, microorganisms communicate, cooperate and compete across their fitness landscapes with communities emerging that feedback on the physical and chemical properties of their environment, ultimately altering the fitness landscape and selecting for new microbial communities with new properties and so on.\nWe have developed a trait-based model of microbial activity that simulates coupled functional guilds that are parameterized with unique combinations of traits that govern fitness under dynamic conditions. Using a reactive transport framework, we simulate the thermodynamics of coupled electron donor-acceptor reactions to predict energy available for cellular maintenance, respiration, biomass development, and enzyme production. From metagenomics, we directly estimate some trait values related to growth and identify the linkage of key traits associated with respiration and fermentation, macromolecule depolymerizing enzymes, and other key functions such as nitrogen fixation. Our simulations were carried out to explore abiotic controls on community emergence such as seasonally fluctuating water table regimes across floodplain organic matter hotspots. Simulations and metagenomic/metatranscriptomic observations highlighted the many dependencies connecting the relative fitness of functional guilds and the importance of chemolithoautotrophic lifestyles. Using an X-Ray microCT-derived soil microaggregate physical model combined with genome-enabled reactive flow and transport we simulated the importance of pore network properties including connectivity in regulating metabolic interdependencies between microbial functional guilds.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation phenology controls the seasonality of many ecosystem processes, as well as numerous biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. Phenology is highly sensitive to climate change and variability, and is thus a key aspect of global change ecology.\nThe goal of the PhenoCam network is to serve as a long-term, continental-scale, phenological observatory. The network uses repeat digital photography—images captured using conventional, visible-wavelength, automated digital cameras—to characterize vegetation phenology in diverse ecosystems across North America and around the world.\nAt present, imagery from over 200 research sites, spanning a wide range of ecoregions, climate zones, and plant functional types, is currently being archived and processed in near-real-time through the PhenoCam project web page (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/). Data derived from PhenoCam imagery have been previously used to evaluate satellite phenology products, to constrain and test new phenology models, to understand relationships between canopy phenology and ecosystem processes, and to study the seasonal changes in leaf-level physiology that are associated with changes in leaf color.\nI will describe a new, publicly-available phenological dataset, derived from over 600 site-years of PhenoCam imagery. For each archived image (ca. 5 million), we extracted RGB (red, green, blue) color channel information, with means and other statistics calculated across a region-of-interest (ROI) delineating a specific vegetation type. From the high-frequency (typically, 30 minute) imagery, we derived time series characterizing vegetation color, including “canopy greenness”, processed to 1- and 3-day intervals. For ecosystems with a single annual cycle of vegetation activity, we derived estimates, with uncertainties, for the start, middle, and end of spring and autumn phenological transitions.\nGiven the lack of multi-year, standardized, and geographically distributed phenological data for North America, we anticipate that these datasets will be widely used by researchers in a variety of fields. Shifts in phenology are a particularly tangible example of the biological impacts of climate change, and thus these data may also find use in science education and outreach to the general public.",

GOAmazon intends to study how aerosols and surface fluxes influence cloud cycles under clean conditions, as well as how aerosol and cloud life cycles, including cloud-aerosol-precipitation interactions, are influenced by pollutant outflow from a tropical megacity. This study employs the SIPAM S band radar, the X Band dual polarization radar, GOES images, disdrometers, CCN counters, radiosondes and data collected by G1 and HALO airplanes. As ancillary data, we used the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, the TERRACLASS (INPE) and EVI from MODIS for surface topography, surface type classification and vegetation index, respectively. Cloud and precipitation are studied as function of aerosol concentration as well surface type and thermodynamic properties. Different sensors and space-time scales are employed to compare the life cycle and cloud size distribution using radar and satellite for different atmospheric conditions. For each IOP, the droplet size distribution using the airplanes or the particle size distribution using disdrometers are described discussing the aerosol, thermodynamic, surface type and topography effects on the clouds and precipitation. The typical precipitation behavior, for each IOP, is described using CFADs and reflectivity distributions. For few specific flights, those measuring ice particles, during the wet season (IOP1), some examples and classifications of convective and stratiform clouds are discussed. Finally, the microphysical properties of the clouds are presented using X band dual pol radar hydrometeor classifications and evaluating the effect of aerosol loading on the cloud vertical structure.",

            "abstract": "The demand for improved climate knowledge and information is well documented. As noted in the IPCC (SREX, AR5), the UNISDR Global Assessment Reports and other assessments, this demand has increased pressure for information to support planning under changing rates and emergence of multiple hazards including climate extremes (drought, heat waves, floods). “Decision support” is now a popular term in the climate applications research community. While existing decision support activities can be identified in many disparate settings (e.g. federal, academic, private), the challenge of changing environments (coupled physical and social) is actually one of crafting implementation strategies for improving decision quality (not just meeting \"user needs\"). This includes overcoming weaknesses in co-production models, moving beyond DSSs as simply “software”, coordinating innovation mapping and diffusion, and providing fora and gaming tools to identify common interests and differences in the way risks are perceived and managed among the affected groups. We outline the development and evolution of multi-hazard early warning systems in the United States and elsewhere, focusing on climate-related hazards. In particular, the presentation will focus on the climate science and information needed for (1) improved monitoring and modeling, (2) generating risk profiles, (3) developing information systems and scenarios for critical thresholds, (4) the net benefits of using new information (5) characterizing and bridging the “last mile” in the context of longer-term risk management.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics have operated on Earth for a majority of its lifetime. Tectonics regulates atmospheric carbon and creates a planetary-scale water cycle, and is a primary factor in the Earth being habitable. While the mechanism for initiating tectonics is unknown, as we expand our search for habitable worlds, understanding which planetary compositions produce planets capable of supporting long-term tectonics is of paramount importance. On Earth, this sustentation of tectonics is a function of both its structure and composition. Currently, however, we have no method to measure the interior composition of exoplanets. In our Solar system, though, Solar abundances for refractory elements mirror the Earth’s to within ~10%, allowing the adoption of Solar abundances as proxies for Earth’s. It is not known, however, whether this mirroring of stellar and terrestrial planet abundances holds true for other star-planet systems without determination of the composition of initial planetesimals via condensation sequence calculations. Currently, all code for ascertaining these sequences are commercially available or closed-source. We present, then, the open-source Arbitrary Composition Condensation Sequence calculator (ArCCoS) for converting the elemental composition of a parent star to that of the planet-building material as well as the extent of oxidation within the planetesimals.\nThese data allow us to constrain the likelihood for one of the main drivers for plate tectonics: the basalt to eclogite transition subducting plates. Unlike basalt, eclogite is denser than the surrounding mantle and thus sinks into the mantle, pulling the overlying slab with it. Without this higher density relative to the mantle, plates stagnate at shallow depths, shutting off plate tectonics. Using the results of ArCCoS as abundance inputs into the MELTS and HeFESTo thermodynamic models, we calculate phase relations for the first basaltic crust and depleted mantle of a terrestrial planet produced from a given stellar composition. We find that for many stellar systems, the basalt-eclogite transition does not increase plate density enough relative to the mantle.

            "abstract": "Isoprene is the predominant volatile organic compound emitted by vegetation. Isoprene emissions occur during daytime, when photo-oxidation is rapid and in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) produces ozone and degrades air quality in polluted regions. Here we show in a city downwind of a deciduous forest that isoprene actually peaks at night, with nocturnal chemistry controlling the fate of that isoprene and the likelihood of a high-ozone episode the following day. When nitrate (NO3­) radicals are suppressed, high isoprene persists through the night, providing photochemical fuel upon daybreak and a dramatic morning ozone peak. On nights with significant NO3, isoprene is removed before dawn; days with low morning isoprene then have lower ozone with a typical afternoon peak. This biogenic-anthropogenic coupling expands the daily high-ozone window and likely has opposite ozone-NOx response to what would otherwise be expected, with implications for exposure and air quality management in such areas.",

            "abstract": "Our goal is to accurately estimate attenuation from seismic data using model regularization in the seismic inversion workflow. One way to achieve this goal is by finding an analytical relation linking Vp to Qp. We derive such an approximate closed-form equation by establishing that the key parameter affecting Vp in clean partially saturated gas sand is porosity, while the two key parameters affecting Qp are porosity and water saturation. We find a simple equation that relates the dry-rock compressional modulus MDry to that of the mineral frame and porosity by using just one adjustable coefficient. Then we use a theoretical model relating Qp at partial saturation to MDry, porosity, and water saturation. Finally, by using these two relations, we find a closed-form transform between Qp and Vp at fixed water saturation. This relation is tested on well data from a clean clastic gas reservoir. Next we create a 2D synthetic gas reservoir section populated with Qp and Vp and generate respective synthetic seismograms. The goal now is to invert this synthetic seismic section for Qp. If we use standard seismic inversion based solely on seismic data, the inverted attenuation model has low resolution, incorrect position, and is distorted. However, adding our relation between velocity and attenuation, we obtain an attenuation model very close to the original section. This method is tested on a 2D real seismic data from GOM. The resulting Qp model matches the geological shape of an absorption body interpreted from seismic section. By using this Qp model in seismic migration, we make the seismic events below the high-absorption layer clearly visible, with improved frequency content and coherency of the events.",

This project focuses on the use of magnetic properties of the Tulare Lake sediments in order to test previous results by dating the sediments and determining the relative lake level at the time of deposition. Shallowing lake conditions were identified leading up to a prominent unconformity from magnetic mineralogy and grain size indicators, primarily decreasing ARM/IRM and S-Ratio values suggesting coarser grain sizes and more oxidizing conditions. Approximately half of the samples possessed well-behaved paleomagnetic directions suitable for paleomagnetic secular variation dating. The results indicate that the sediments below the unconformity were deposited approximately 7600-6700 14C years ago (~7600 to 8500 cal yr B.P.), and the sediments above the unconformity were deposited approximately 2200-500 14C years ago. The ages of the corresponding sediments are consistent with the time intervals during which lake level was predicted to be above the elevation of the Poso Canal site before and after a mid-Holocene regression.",

            "abstract": "Multi-channel seismic (MCS) images and wide-angle sonobuoy data acquired during a 2011 cruise on the R/V Thomas G. Thompson (TN272) show widespread emplacement of igneous sills and broadly thickened oceanic Layer 2 through hundreds of kilometers of oceanic crust in one of the oldest ocean basins in the western Pacific, a region known as the Jurassic Quiet Zone (JQZ). Oceanic crust from the JQZ has grown through at least two main magmatic phases: It was formed by mid-ocean ridge processes in the Jurassic (at ~170 Ma), and then it was added to by a substantial Cretaceous magmatic event (at ~75-125 Ma). The scale of Cretaceous magmatism is exemplified by massive seafloor features such as the Ontong Java Plateau, Mid-Pacific Mountains, Marshall-Gilbert Islands, Marcus-Wake Seamount Chain, and numerous guyots, seamounts, and volcaniclastic flows observed throughout the region. We use seismic data to image heavily intruded and modified oceanic crust along an 800-km-long transect through the JQZ in order to examine how processes of secondary crustal growth – including magmatic emplacement, transport, and distribution – are expressed in the structure of modified oceanic crust. We also model gravity anomalies to constrain crustal thickness and depth to the Moho. Our observations suggest that western Pacific crust was modified via the following modes of emplacement: (a) extrusive seafloor flows that may or may not have grown into seamounts, (b) seamounts formed through intrusive diking that pushed older sediments aside during their formation, and (c) igneous sills that intruded sediments at varying depths. Emplacement modes (a) and (b) tend to imply a focused, pipe-like mechanism for melt transport through the lithosphere. Such a mechanism does not explain the observed broadly distributed intrusive emplacement of mode (c) however, which may entail successive sill emplacement between igneous basement and sediments thickening oceanic Layer 2 along ~400 km of our seismic line. This mode of crustal growth seems to require broad zones of melt transport through the lithosphere and across the Moho.",

Performance of MLR in developing one-month lead categorical forecasts is evaluated for various river basins over the US Sunbelt. Comparison of MLR with the estimated categorical forecasts from Principle Component Regression (PCR) method under both cross-validation and split-sampling validation reveals that in general the forecasts from MLR has better performance and lower Rank Probability Score (RPS) compared to the PCR forecasts. In addition, MLR performs better than PCR method particularly in arid basins that exhibit strong skewness in seasonal flows with records of distinct dry years.

We have also made measurements on restructured mature-soot particles with a fractal dimension of 2.4. The soot samples were size selected using a differential mobility analyzer and characterized with a scanning mobility particle sizer and centrifugal particle mass analyzer. We reproduced the LII and scattering temporal profiles with an energy- and mass-balance model, which accounted for heating of particles passed through a CW-laser beam over laser-particle interaction times of ~10 microseconds. The results demonstrate a strong influence of aggregate size and morphology on LII and scattering signals. Conductive cooling competes with absorptive heating on these time scales; the effects are reduced with increasing aggregate size and fractal dimension. These effects can lead to a significant delay in the onset of the LII signal, which could be mistaken for a coating effect. These effects may also explain an apparent low bias in the SP2 measurements for small particle sizes, particularly for fresh, mature soot. The results additionally reveal significant perturbations to the measured scattering signal from LII interference and suggest swelling or popping of the aggregates during sublimation. We are characterizing black carbon measurement techniques prior to deployment of instrumentation in Barrow, Alaska for a project focused on measurements and modeling of black carbon in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The existence and possible transition from positive to negative soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks is explored in this presentation using collocated flux tower measurements (Ameriflux) and atmospheric profiles from reanalysis. The focus is on the series of physical processes that lead to these local feedbacks connecting remote sea surface temperature changes (SST anomalies) to local soil moisture and boundary layer responses. Seasonal and Agricultural droughts are particularly useful test beds for examining these feedback processes because they are typically characterized by prolonged stretches of rain-free days followed by some termination condition. To quantify the full process-chain across these distinct spatial scales, complimentary information from several well-established land-atmosphere coupling metrics are used including, but not limited to, Mixing Diagram approaches, Soil Moisture Memory, and the Heated Condensation Framework. Preliminary analysis shows that there may be transitions from negative and positive soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks as droughts develop. This is largely instigated by persistent atmospheric forcing that initially promotes increased surface latent heat flux, which limits boundary layer depth and dry air entrainment. However, if stagnant synoptic conditions continue eventually soil moisture is depleted to the point of shutting off surface latent heat flux producing deep boundary layers and increased dry air entrainment thus deepening drought stress. A package of standardized Fortran 90 modules called the Coupling Metrics Toolkit (CoMeT;\nhttps://github.com/abtawfik/coupling-metrics\n) used to calculate these land-atmosphere coupling metrics is also briefly presented.",

            "abstract": "Active layer detachment sliding and retrogressive thaw slumping are important modes of upland permafrost degradation and disturbance in permafrost regions, and have been linked with climate warming trends, ecosystem impacts, and permafrost carbon release. In the Brooks Range and foothills of northwest Alaska, these features are widespread, with distribution linked to multiple landscape properties. Inter-related and co-varying terrain properties, including surficial geology, topography, geomorphology, vegetation and hydrology, are generally considered key drivers of permafrost landscape characteristics and responses to climate perturbation. However, these inter-relationships as collective drivers of terrain suitability for active layer detachment and retrogressive thaw slump processes are poorly understood in this region. We empirically tested and refined a hypothetical model of terrain factors driving active layer detachment and retrogressive thaw slump terrain suitability, and used final model results to generate synoptic terrain suitability estimates across the study region. Spatial data for terrain properties were examined against locations of 2,492 observed active layer detachments and 805 observed retrogressive thaw slumps using structural equation modelling and integrated terrain unit analysis. Factors significant to achieving model fit were found to substantially hone and constrain region-wide terrain suitability estimates, suggesting that omission of relevant factors leads to broad overestimation of terrain suitability. Resulting probabilistic maps of terrain suitability, and a threshold-delineated mask of suitable terrain, were used to quantify and describe landscape settings typical of these features. 51% of the study region is estimated suitable terrain for retrogressive thaw slumps, compared with 35% for active layer detachment slides, while 29% of the study region is estimated suitable for both. Results improve current understanding of arctic landscape vulnerability and responses to climate change, and enhance the capability to estimate quantities of permafrost carbon and nitrogen potentially subject to release through these modes of permafrost degradation.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen in geologic materials is a tracer and record of biologic activity. Analysis can be difficult, however, as concentrations are often low (~1s to 10s ppm). The most stable form for N to be preserved in rocks and minerals is as NH4+, which is derived from organic matter and substitutes into mineral lattices for K+. Thus, measuring NH4+ content serves as a good proxy for total N content.\nFluorometry (FL) is the standard technique for aqueous samples, and has a number of advantages over older indophenol-blue based, colorimetric (IBC) techniques (Hall, 1993). These include lower sample processing time, safer reagents, more stable reactions, and greater precision. In this study, I adapt a fluorometry technique (Holmes et al., 1999) for use in analyzing NH4+ concentration in geologic materials.\nSamples and standards were dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, neutralized with potassium hydroxide, then analyzed either with FL or IBC. As part of IBC, a distillation step was carried out to concentrate NH4+, and both techniques were used after this step to as well. Initial results show promise, as reproducible, ppm-level concentrations are demonstrated in several different rock types of various ages: Neoproterozoic siliciclastic sediments, a Jurassic granodiorite, a Cretaceous serpentinite, and Neoproterozoic carbonates. Concentrations are comparable between the two methods, though curiously fluorometry indicates NH4+ concentrations about 22% lower. Distillation appears effective in strengthening the signal for FL, though it may not be necessary for accurate results.\nThere are several factors affecting the quality of FL. Sample pH appears to be the most important. At pH>9, NH3 is stable, and can easily escape a solution. Ensuring samples remain below pH 9 should prove key. Additional tests are being carried out to improve sample recovery, lessen time of HF dissolution, and improve accuracy.\nThis new application of a standard technique should prove useful not only in determining NH4+ content in geologic samples, but can also serve as a first step in determining a strategy for further analysis. It appears to accurately measure concentrations down to a few ppm, and has low associated error (~5%).",

We designed systems using OsmoSamplers to collect pore water samples for methylmercury, methane, chloride, and sulfate analysis, sampling in a vegetated area and an area devegetated by clipping. Samples were collected over a 27 day period and stored in coils to create a temporal data set of in situ concentrations. This time series allows us to explore the methane-methylmercury connection and the effects of vegetation removal on methylmercury production. Some methanogens are known to methylate mercury, but the relative importance of the methane community in mercury methylation is not well understood. We hypothesized a positive correlation between methane and methylmercury production and a decrease in methylmercury production corresponding to vegetation removal. We also sought to demonstrate the feasibility of using OsmoSamplers to look at methylmercury flux in relation to these controls on mercury methylation. This study is a preliminary exploration of this technology in a marsh environment. Using our system we have successfully collected pore water samples.

Therefore, one of the 21stCentury Grant Challenges faced by global population is securing water for food. However, the soil-water behavior in an agricultural environment is complex; among others, one of the key properties we recognize is water repellence or hydrophobicity, which affects many hydrogeological and hazardous conditions such as excessive water infiltration, runoff, and soil erosion.\nUnder a US-Israel research program funded by USDA and BARD at Israel, we have proposed the development of a novel micro-unmanned aerial vehicle (micro-UAV or drone) based hyperspectral imaging platform for identifying and assessing soil repellence at low altitudes with enhanced flexibility, much reduced cost, and ultimately easy use. This aerial imaging system consists of a generic micro-UAV, hyperspectral sensor aided by GPS/IMU, on-board computing units, and a ground station. The target benefits of this system include: (1) programmable waypoint navigation and robotic control for multi-view imaging; (2) ability of two- or three-dimensional scene reconstruction for complex terrains; and (3) fusion with other sensors to realize real-time diagnosis (e.g., humidity and solar irradiation that may affect soil-water sensing). In this talk we present our methodology and processes in integration of hyperspectral imaging, on-board sensing and computing, hyperspectral data modeling, and preliminary field demonstration and verification of the developed prototype.",

            "abstract": "The identification and characterization of hydrated minerals within ancient aqueous environments on Mars are high priorities for determining the past habitability of the red planet. Few studies, however, have focused on characterizing the entire mineral assemblage, even though it could aide our understanding of past environments. In this study we use both spaceborne (Landsat, Hyperion) and field (VNIR + Raman spectroscopic) analyses to study the mineralogy of various salt flats (salars) of the northern region of Chile as an analog for Martian evaporites.\nCore and marginal zones within the salars are easily distinguished on the Landsat 8 band color composites. These areas host different mineralogic assemblages that often result in different landscape types (see Flahaut et al., EPSC 2015). The lower elevation Salar de Atacama, located in the Andean pre-depression, is characterized by a unique thick halite crust at its center, whereas various assemblages of calcium (gypsum, anhydrite) and sodium (mirabilite) sulfates and clays were found at its margin. Sulfates form the main crust of the Andean salars to the east, although various compositions are observed. These compositions seem to be controlled by the type of brine (Ca, SO4 or mixed). Sulfate crusts were found to be generally thin (<5 cm) with a sharp transition to the underlying clay, silt or sand-rich alluvial deposits.\nUsed together, VNIR and Raman spectroscopy, plus morphologic analyses provided a powerful tool to distinguish among different types of salt crusts. Ongoing XRD analyses will quantify the mineral assemblages. We found that the Atacama’s unique arid and volcanic environment, coupled with the transition recorded in some of the salars has a strong Mars analogue potential. Characterizing the outcrops at a variety of environments from alkaline, lake waters to more acidic salar brines and the mineralogy observed at these sites may facilitate constraining geochemical environments on Mars.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the shifting in historical patterns of pastureland (natural and planted) in Brazil using a new high-resolution (approximately 1 km x 1 km) spatially explicit reconstruction of land use from 1940 to 2012 and stocking rate of cattle maps from 1990 to 2012. We also identified the top 5% (highest yields) pixels in the 2010 stocking rate map and we assessed the historical trends in intensification and extensification practices in Brazil. We focus our analyzes in Amazonia and Cerrado biomes, in Mato Grosso and Pará states, and in the new agricultural frontier called MATOPIBA – which is formed by Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia states. Natural pastureland expanded until the 1970s and, after that, most areas with natural pasture were replaced by planted pasture, which is more profitable. In 2012, natural pastures were still predominant in the Pampas (located in southern Rio Grande do Sul) and the Pantanal (located in western Mato Grosso do Sul). On the other hand, planted pastureland expanded in area between 1975 and 2012, especially in the Cerrado biome. Brazilian stocking rate of cattle increased, but remains close to 1.0 head/ha between 1990 and 2010 and the top 5% were about twice as high as the average in all regions analyzed. The yield gap (difference between average and the top 5% pixels) was largest in Pará state, where the stocking rate of cattle was below 50% of the potential given 2010 practices. The increase in cattle production in Amazonia biome and in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará came from both intensification and expansion of pasturelands. In contrast, pasturelands in Cerrado and MATOPIBA decreased in area while stocking rates of cattle increased gradually. Our results provide new insights about land use change and productivity in Brazilian territory that could guide future agricultural and conservation discussions, decisions, and policies.",

            "abstract": "The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) is a ~650-kyr interval of global warming, with a brief ~50 ky long peak warming interval, and an abrupt termination. Deep sea and surface ocean temperature evolution across this interval are fairly well constrained, but thus far we have little understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the gradual warming and rapid recovery. Carbonate mass accumulation rates suggest a shoaling of the carbonate compensation depth, and studies on alkenones indicate increasing atmospheric CO2 levels during the MECO. This suggests an increase in surface ocean CO2, and consequently ocean acidification. However, the severity and timing of the proposed ocean acidification with respect to the onset, peak warming and the termination are currently not well resolved.\nThe boron isotopic composition (δ11B) recorded in planktic foraminifer shells offers an opportunity to infer oceanic pH across this interval. We are working on a boron isotope reconstruction from Southern Ocean IODP site 738 and South Atlantic IODP site 1263, covering 42.0 to 38.5 Ma. These sites are characterized by good carbonate preservation and well-defined age models have been established. Additionally, ecology, nutrient content and bottom-water oxygenation have been shown to change significantly across the event towards a more eutrophic, periodically oxygen-depleted environment supporting different biological communities.\nWe selected the planktic foraminifera species Acarinina spinuloinflata for this study because it is symbiont-bearing, suggesting a near-surface habitat and little vertical migration in the water column, and because of its abundance in the samples. δ11B data will be translated to surface ocean pH and atmospheric pCO2 will be approximated to refine knowledge about the carbon cycle during this time. Parallel analysis of two core sites will help to evaluate the tenacity of the data.",

            "abstract": "Wells and Coppersmith (1994) have used fault data to fit simple linear regression (SLR) models to explain linear relations between moment magnitude and logarithms of fault measurements such as rupture length, rupture width, rupture area and surface displacement. Our work extends their analyses to multiple linear regression (MLR) models by considering two or more predictors with updated data. Treating the quantitative variables (rupture length, rupture width, rupture area and surface displacement) as predictors to fit linear regression models on magnitude, we have discovered that the two-predictor model using rupture area and maximum displacement fits the best. The next best alternative predictors are surface length and rupture area. Neither slip type nor slip direction is a significant predictor by fitting of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. Corrected Akaike information criterion (Burnham and Anderson, 2002) is used as a model assessment criterion. Comparisons between simple linear regression models of Wells and Coppersmith (1994) and our multiple linear regression models are presented. Our work is done using fault data from Wells and Coppersmith (1994) and new data from Ellswort (2000), Hanks and Bakun (2002, 2008), Shaw (2013), and Finite-Source Rupture Model Database (http://equake-rc.info/SRCMOD/, 2015).",

            "abstract": "Subglacial hydrology and the dynamics therein are important modulators of ice flow in the Greenland Ice Sheet. At tidewater outlet glaciers the characteristics of proglacial discharge affect fjord circulation, sediment deposition, submarine melt rates, and iceberg calving. Information about the spatio-temporal variability of discharge is limited by the challenges of in situ data collection at tidewater glaciers. Here, we present summertime measurements of subglacial discharge variability using a thermal infrared (7.5μm to 13μm) camera and intervalometer at Kangerlussuup Sermia (KS), a ~4km wide outlet glacier in the Uummannaq Bay region of West Greenland (71.46 N, 51.43 W). KS has an advantageous geometry for this investigation because of its shallow grounding zone and well-entrenched subglacial hydrologic system. In tandem, these characteristics promote buoyant freshwater to rise to the fjord surface from discrete outlets at the glacier's base. We investigate the timing of plume activity at these outlets and discuss potential controls on outlet switching.\nRaw camera measurements cannot be accurately converted to surface temperature without correcting for environmental variables and scene geometry, both of which are time-evolving during data acquisition. Our processing methodology relies on a variety of existing techniques -- image segmentation, ray casting, atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, Monte Carlo simulations -- and a variety of ancillary data products -- satellite imagery, atmospheric reanalysis, meteorologic and hydrologic measurements -- to produce the final results. What is gained is an unprecedented view into interactions between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere that control the dynamic and sensitive terminus region of a tidewater outlet glacier.",

            "abstract": "We report progress in demonstrating a pulsed, wavelength-resolved IPDA lidar technique for measuring the tropospheric CO2 concentrations as a candidate for NASA’s ASCENDS mission. The CO2 lidar flies on NASA’s DC-8 aircraft and measures the atmospheric backscatter profiles and shape of the 1572.33 nm absorption line by using 30 wavelength samples distributed across the lube. Our post-flight analysis estimates the lidar range and pulse energies at each wavelength 10 times per second. The retrievals solve for the optimum CO2 absorption line shape and the column average CO2 concentrations using radiative transfer calculations based on HITRAN, the aircraft altitude, range to the scattering surface, and the atmospheric conditions. We compare these to CO2 concentrations sampled by in-situ sensors on the aircraft. The number of wavelength samples can be reduced in the retrievals.\nDuring the ASCENDS airborne campaign in 2013 two flights were made in February over snow in the Rocky Mountains and the Central Plains allowing measurement of snow-covered surface reflectivity.\nSeveral improvements were made to the lidar for the 2014 campaign. These included using a new step-locked laser diode source, and incorporating a new HgCdTe APD detector and analog digitizer into the lidar receiver. Testing showed this detector had higher sensitivity, analog response, and a more linear dynamic range than the PMT detector used previously. In 2014 flights were made in late August and early September over the California Central Valley, the redwood forests along the California coast, two desert areas in Nevada and California, and two flights above growing agriculture in Iowa. Two flights were also made under OCO-2 satellite ground tracks. Analyses show the retrievals of lidar range and CO2 column absorption, and mixing ratio worked well when measuring over topography with rapidly changing height and reflectivity, and through thin clouds and aerosol scattering. The lidar measurements clearly show the decrease in CO2 concentration over growing cropland in Iowa. In several flights the agreement of the lidar with the column average concentration was < 1ppm, with standard deviation of 0.9 ppm. A summary of these results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Ground-based remote sensing geodesy has huge potential for volcano monitoring and improved modelling of volcanic hazards. Terrestrial Radar Interferometers (TRI) can rapidly and accurately create DEMs and repeat occupation of sites allows measurement of deformation. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry can be used to construct DEMs and SfM surveys can be carried out with relatively accessible equipment. TRI and SfM techniques are highly complimentary: The upper slopes of a volcano may be cloud covered, but can be imaged by TRI, whereas lower canyons may be in radar shadow, but can be imaged with SfM. Both methods are also complimentary to satellite observations (e.g. SRTM, ASTER), offering some advantages in terms of coverage and resolution. We present the acquisition of two new geodetic datasets at Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia (NRV). NRV is a large glacierised volcano that erupted in 1985, generating a glacier-derived lahar that killed over 23,000 people in the city of Armero and 2,000 people in the town of Chinchina. NRV is the most active volcano in Colombia and since 2012 has generated small eruptions (with no casualties) and constant gas and ash emissions. In early 2015, we collected data from several sites close to the crater of NRV and around the Azufrado drainage (the site of previous debris avalanches and lahars). The TRI was operated from three sites, while drone- and ground-based cameras ventured into the canyons to fill in radar shadow gaps. These data have three primary uses: 1) generation of high-precision DEMs for lahar modelling and visualisation of previous events, 2) imaging of summit glacier motion, and 3) establishing a baseline for long-term deformation studies. We discuss ground-based remote sensing geodetic data from high-tech (TRI) to low-tech (SfM) methods and show the importance of combining these complimentary datasets to improve DEMs for hazard modelling and volcano monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Normal faults are essential in shaping the seafloor formed at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges, and information on their behavior on short (seismic cycle) time scales is limited. Here we combine catalogs of hydro-acoustically recorded [Bohnenstiehl et al., 2000; 2002] and teleseismic earthquakes to analyze the modes of seismic moment release along the Northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Marathon (12ºN) and Oceanographer (35ºN) Fracture Zones. Along about 50% of the ridge axis, tectonic extension is taken up by steep, symmetric conjugate faults that bound a well-defined axial valley. By contrast, along the remaining 50% most of the tectonic strain is accommodated by large-offset detachment faults [Escartín et al., 2008].\nUpon declustering the catalogs to remove major aftershock sequences, we estimate seismicity rates and infer seismic moment release along the ridge axis by converting hydro-acoustic source level to moment magnitude. The shape of the resulting cumulative moment release curves is then investigated at individual ridge sections defined by tectonic interpretation of seafloor morphology. Qualitatively, the seismogenic behavior of symmetric sections appears more stick slip-like (with large events separated by a few years of relative quiescence) than that of detachment-dominated sections, which feature more frequent, smaller events.\nWe quantify these differences by measuring relevant parameters (e.g., background seismicity rates, b-values...) along different tectonic ridge sections, as well as along sliding windows with no prior knowledge of the seafloor morphology. Finally, we assess possible relations between the observed contrasted seismogenic behavior and the systematic variations in fault geometry and rheology (dip, offset, cross-axis and down-dip extent, presence of weak minerals in the fault zone) inferred from seafloor observations along slow-spreading ridges.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary carbon isotope values (δ13C) of bulk organic matter and long chain (C25 to C35) n-alkanes are among the most long-lived and widely utilized proxies of organic matter and vegetation source. The carbon distribution (e.g. average carbon chain length, ACL) and isotope signature from long chain n-alkanes had been intensively used on paleoclimate studies because they are less influenced by diagenesis, differential preservation of compound classes, and changes in the sources of organic matter than bulk δ13C values. Recently, studies of modern plant n-alkanes have challenged the use of carbon distribution and carbon isotope signature from sedimentary n-alkanes as reliable indicators of vegetation and climate change. The climate in central-south western South America (SA) is projected to become significantly warmer and drier over the next several decades to centuries in response to anthropogenically driven warming. Paleolimnological studies along western SA are critical to obtain more realistic and reliable regional reconstructions of past climate and environments, including vegetation and water budget variability. Here we discuss bulk δ13C, distribution and δ13C in long chain n-alkanes from a suite of ~40 lake surface sediment (core-top) samples spanning the transition from a Mediterranean climate with a patchwork of cultivated vegetation, pastureland, conifers in central Chile to a rainy temperate climate dominated by broadleaf deciduous and evergreen forest. Data are compared to the latitudinal and orographic climatic trends of the Andes based on the climatology (e.g. precipitation and temperature) of the locations of all lakes involved in this study, using monthly gridded reanalysis products of the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), based on the NCEP global forecast model and meteorological stations available in the region, from January 1979 to December 2010 with a 0.5° horizontal resolution.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant that has harmful effects on human and plant life. The climate and urban emissions in Houston, TX and Denver, CO can be conducive for significant ozone production and thus, high ozone events. Tighter government strategies for ozone mitigation have been proposed, which involve reducing the current EPA eight-hour ozone standard from 75 ppb to 65-70 ppb. These strategies rely on the reduction of ozone precursors in order to decrease the ozone production rate, P(O3). The changes in the ozone concentration at a certain location are dependent upon P(O3), so decreasing P(O3) can decrease ozone levels provided that it has not been transported from other areas. Air quality models test reduction strategies before they are implemented, locate ozone sources, and predict ozone episodes.\nTraditionally, P(O3) has been calculated by models. However, large uncertainties in model emissions inventories, chemical mechanisms, and meteorology can reduce confidence in this approach. A new instrument, the Measurement of Ozone Production Sensor (MOPS) directly measures P(O3) and can provide an alternate approach to determining P(O3). An updated version of the Penn State MOPS (MOPSv2.0) was deployed to Houston, TX and Denver, CO as a part of NASA’s DISCOVER-AQ field campaign in the summers of 2013 and 2014, respectively. We present MOPS directly-measured P(O3) rates from these areas, as well as comparisons to zero-dimensional and three-dimensional modeled P(O3) using the RACM2 and MCMv2.2 mechanisms. These comparisons demonstrate the potential of the MOPS to test and evaluate model-derived P(O3), to advance the understanding of model chemical mechanisms, and to improve predictions of high ozone events.",

            "abstract": "Numerical model is the major tool used in the studies of climate change and climate projection. Because of the enormous complexity involved in such climate models, they are usually run on supercomputing centers or at least high-performance computing clusters. The cloud computing environment, however, offers an alternative option for running climate models. Compared to traditional supercomputing environment, cloud computing offers more flexibility yet also extra technical challenges. Using the CESM (community earth system model) as a case study, we test the feasibility of running the climate model in the cloud-based virtual computing environment. Using the cloud computing resources offered by Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and an open-source software, StarCluster, which can set up virtual cluster, we investigate how to run the CESM on AWS EC2 and the efficiency of parallelization of CESM on the AWS virtual cluster. We created virtual computing cluster using StarCluster on the AWS EC2 instances and carried out CESM simulations on such virtual cluster. We then compared the wall-clock time for one year of CESM simulation on the virtual cluster with that on a local high-performance computing (HPC) cluster with infiniband connections and operated by the University of Michigan. The results show that the CESM model can be efficiently scaled with number of CPUs on the AWS EC2 virtual computer cluster, and the parallelization efficiency is comparable to that on local HPC cluster. For standard configuration of the CESM at a spatial resolution of 1.9-degree latitude and 2.5-degree longitude, increasing the number of CPUs from 16 to 64 leads to a more than twice reduction in wall-clock running time and the scaling is nearly linear. Beyond 64 CPUs, the communication latency starts to overweight the saving of distributed computing and the parallelization efficiency becomes nearly level off.",

            "abstract": "We have carried out a comprehensive survey of the best Cassini ISS data of Saturn's main rings for the purpose of cataloguing all observed spiral density waves, spiral bending waves, and other radial and quasi-radial ring structure. Our survey has revealed a number of new features, including the first known resonant waves raised by Enceladus and Hyperion, thus increasing the number of points at which the local surface density and viscosity of the rings can be measured (cf. Tiscareno et al. 2007, Icarus).\nWe convert each 2-D image taken by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) into a 1-D \"radial scan\" by combining as many as a thousand pixels at each radial location. This process suppresses local structure, azimuthal structure, and random noise, causing ISS to be the optimal Cassini instrument for detecting a certain class of low-amplitude features. Finally, we employ wavelet techniques (cf. Tiscareno et al. 2007, Icarus) to elucidate subtle periodic and quasi-periodic features in the radial scan data.\nResonant perturbations in the rings can be ranked according to their relative strengths (Lissauer and Cuzzi 1982, AJ). We will present an update of that work along with a comprehensive map of the resonances that produce observed features in the rings. We will identify the strongest expected perturbations that do not have observed manifestations, and will discuss whether the absence is likely to reflect a real limit of ring responsiveness, or (as with previous observations) to reflect sensitivity limits. We will also present a catalogue of wave-like features whose cause is unknown, posing new puzzles.",

            "abstract": "This study attempts to apply queueing theory to develop a stochastic framework that could account for the random-sized batch arrivals of incoming sediment particles into receiving waters. Sediment particles, control volume, mechanics of sediment transport (such as mechanics of suspension, deposition and resuspension) are treated as the customers, service facility and the server respectively in queueing theory. In the framework, the stochastic diffusion particle tracking model (SD-PTM) and resuspension of particles are included to simulate the random transport trajectories of suspended particles. The most distinguished characteristic of queueing theory is that customers come to the service facility in a random manner. In analogy to sediment transport, this characteristic is adopted to model the random-sized batch arrival process of sediment particles including the random occurrences and random magnitude of incoming sediment particles. The random occurrences of arrivals are simulated by Poisson process while the number of sediment particles in each arrival can be simulated by a binominal distribution. Simulations of random arrivals and random magnitude are proposed individually to compare with the random-sized batch arrival simulations. Simulation results are a probabilistic description for discrete sediment transport through ensemble statistics (i.e. ensemble means and ensemble variances) of sediment concentrations and transport rates. Results reveal the different mechanisms of incoming particles will result in differences in the ensemble variances of concentrations and transport rates under the same mean incoming rate of sediment particles.",

            "abstract": "The structure of Madagascar's crust is determined using both body wave receiver functions as well as an analysis of surface waves using ambient-noise and two-plane-wave earthquake surface waves analyses. The primary data used are from the 2011-2013 MACOMO (Madagascar, the Comoros, and Mozambique) broadband seismic array from the PASSCAL program of IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology), funded by the NSF. Additional data came from the RHUM-RUM project (led by G. Barruol and K. Sigloch), the Madagascar Seismic Profile (led by F. Tilmann), and the GSN. The crustal structure of Madagascar, which had previously only been inferred from a gravity survey assuming isostasy, shows a strong correlation with its tectonic history. Crustal thicknesses are greatest, reaching 45 km, along the spine of Madagascar’s mountains, which run north-south across the island. Crustal thicknesses thin to the east and west, which are both regions of tectonic separation, however, with very different results. Extensive crustal thinning occurred along the western coasts of Madagascar when the island rifted away from mainland Africa beginning 160 Ma ago. The crust is as thin as 20 km here, but the thickness of basin sediments is as great as 9 km, with the crystalline basement continental crust thinning to 12 km at its thinnest. Along the east coast, the crustal thickness is within the 33-38 km range, but it is thickest in the two places where mesoarchaean crust was rifted off from the Indian subcontinent when it broke away from Madagascar. Surface wave studies show that velocities beneath Madagascar are generally slow, when compared to global models such as AK135. This appears to be due to the occurrence of Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in three regions of Madagascar (north, central, and southwest), each of which has strong underlying seismic low-velocity anomalies in the lithospheric mantle and asthenosphere.",

We employed an analytical pore-scale representation of evaporation from porous surfaces to define potential evaporation using a hypothetical steady-state reference temperature for air and evaporating surface. The feedback between drying land surfaces and overlaying air properties is implicitly incorporated in the hypothetical steady-state where the sensible heat flux vanishes and available energy is consumed by evaporation. Potential evaporation based on steady-state surface temperature was in surprisingly good agreement with class A pan evaporation measurements suggesting that pan evaporation occurs with negligible sensible heat flux. The model facilitates a new analytical generalization of the asymmetric complementary relationship across a wide range of meteorological conditions with good agreement between measured and predicted actual evaporation.",

Here we assess existing glacial isostatic adjustments (GIA) predictions by analysing 1995–2015 data from 61 continuous GPS receivers located along the margin of the Greenland ice sheet. Since GPS receivers measure both the GIA and elastic signals, we isolate GIA, by removing the elastic adjustments of the lithosphere due to present-day mass changes using high-resolution fields of ice surface elevation change derived from satellite and airborne altimetry measurements (ERS1/2, ICESat, ATM, ENVISAT, and CryoSat-2). For most GPS stations, our observed GIA rates contradict GIA predictions; particularly, we find huge uplift rates in southeast Greenland of up to 14 mm/yr while models predict rates of 0-2 mm/yr. Our results suggest possible improvements of GIA predictions, and hence of the poorly constrained ice load history and Earth structure models for Greenland.",

            "abstract": "The lithospheric structure of the Pacific and North American plates play an important role in modulating plate deformation along the California margin. Pure path models indicate that the Pacific plate has a fast thick (80km) lid overlaying a strong low velocity zone (LVZ) extending to beyond 300 km depth. In contrast, the North America structure is characterized by a relatively thin (25-35km) lid and a shallow LVZ. Vertical ray paths have similar travel times across the plate boundary for the two models, making resolution of the transitional structure difficult. Earthquakes such as the 2014 March 10 Mw 6.8 Mendocino and 2014 August 25 Mw 6.0 Napa events recorded at regional distances across California provide an opportunity to study horizontal paths and track the lateral variation in the lower crust–uppermost mantle structure under the Californian margin. Observations from both Napa and Mendocino events show direct SH-wave arrivals at Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) stations are systematically earlier (up to 10 s) for coastal and island stations relative to inland sites. The shift in SH arrival times may be due to features such as varying crustal thickness, varying upper mantle velocity and the presence of a fast seismic lid. To test the different hypotheses, we perform extensive forward modeling using both 1-D frequency-wavenumber and 3-D finite-difference approaches. The model that best fits the SH arrival times has a fast lid (Vs = 4.7 km/s) underlying the whole California margin, with the lid increasing in thickness from east to west to a maximum thickness about 70 km in the western offshore region. The fast, thick seismic lid lends strength and rigidity to the Pacific plate lithosphere in contrast with the weaker North American continental plate, which influences the overall plate deformation along the Californian margin and is in agreement with GPS measurements.",

            "abstract": "Large-eddy simulations are used to investigate the role of aerosol loading on organized Stratocumulus. We prescribed the cloud droplet number concentration (Nc) and considered it as the proxy for different aerosol loading. While the presence of drizzle amplifies the mesoscale variability as is in Savic-Jovcic and Stevens (JAS, 2008), two noticeable findings are discussed here:\nFirst, the scale of marine boundary layer circulation appears to be independent of aerosol loading, suggesting a major role of the turbulence. The precise role of the turbulence in stratocumulus organization is studied by modifying the large scale fluctuations from the LES domain.\nSecond, while it is commonly thought that the whole circulation needs to be represented for robust cloud development, we find that stratocumulus dynamics, including variables like w'w' and w'w'w', are remarkably robust even if large scales are ignored by simply reducing the domain sizes. The only variable that is sensitive to the change of the scale is the amount of cloudiness.\nDespite their smaller cloud thickness and inhomogeneous macroscopic structure for low Nc, individual drizzling clouds have sizes that are commensurate with circulation scale. We observe an Nc threshold below which stratocumulus is thin enough so that a little decrease of Nc would lead to great change of cloud fraction.\nThe simulated cloud albedo is more sensitive to in-cloud liquid water content than to the amount of cloudiness since the former decreases at least three times faster than the latter due to drizzle. The main impact of drizzle evaporation is observed to keep the sub-cloud layer moist and as a result to extend the lifetime of stratocumulus by a couple of hours.",

            "abstract": "The flammability of California coastal marsh vegetation is highest in winter and spring when dominant high marsh plants such as Sarcocornia pacifica are dormant. With climate change the number of cool-season fires are increasing in the state, and marsh systems are becoming more vulnerable to fire disturbance. Very little information exists in peer-reviewed or grey literature on the presence of fire in Pacific Coast tidal marshes. In 1993, the Green Meadows fire in Ventura County, California burned a small portion of tidally influenced Sarcocornia­-dominated marsh at Point Mugu. After the May 2013 Springs Fire burned a similar portion of the salt marsh vegetation, we conducted a two-year vegetation recovery survey using transects of surface vegetation plots and MODIS derived NDVI remote sensing monitoring. Recovery during the first year was limited. Sixteen months into the recovery period, percent plant coverage reached an average of approximately 60% for all plots in the burned area, as opposed to an average of 100% in control plots, and remained at that level for the duration of the study. NDVI did not approach near pre-fire conditions until 19 months after the fire. While recovery may have been influenced by California’s current extreme drought conditions, the recurrence of fire and rate of recovery raise many important questions as to the role of fire in Pacific coast tidal marshes. For example, the lack of Salicornia cover over more than an entire breeding season would be detrimental to protected species such as Rallus obsoletus. Fire adds new vulnerabilities on critical tidal marsh habitat already taxed by the threat of sea-level rise, coastal squeeze and invasive species.",

This work comparing ground data acquired by different systems for the same atmospheric scenario regarding cloud cover. We used two ground sites located at Florianópolis, Brazil, where cloud cover and solar irradiance data were acquired. Solar radiation data and sky images were acquired at SONDA station (-27◦28’, -48◦29’, 15m asl) and cloud cover data collected at the international airport meteorological station (-27◦40’, -48◦29’). This study compares these two datasets for sky scenarios presenting only stratocumulus cloud cover. The results show the complexity of the interaction process between solar irradiance and cloud cover and how it affects ground observations. It can be seen that even when sky is completely cloudy (8/8 or 100%) by a single type of cloud, the ratio between global and diffuse irradiance varied from 0.75 till 0.98.",

            "abstract": "Arctic Alaska is being impacted by elevated atmospheric temperatures and one consequence could be intensified emissions of greenhouse gases from Arctic lakes as the underlying permafrost thaws. We measured two pathways for methane release from lakes: diffusion and ebullition. The dissolved CH4 concentration in the lake will be determined by performing a headspace extraction. Ebullition and diffusive flux will be measured using floating gas chambers at the lake surface and be measured on a set time interval. Furthermore, stable isotope measurements will establish the CH4 source as biogenic (δ13C -61‰) or thermogenic (δ13C -41‰). Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas compared to carbon dioxide (CO2) with a global warming potential of 34 times CO2 on a one-hundred year time scale. It is important establish the role of CH4 emissions from Arctic lakes as part of the global CH4 budget, due to the large carbon reserves that can become active in the carbon cycle from thawing of the underlying permafrost as lake temperature warms. The measurements will be collected throughout the day for about three weeks in August 2015. The CH4 flux trends will be compared to factors such as time of day, weather conditions, lake temperature, lake depth and size, and concentration of dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen. The lakes in this study are part of the Circum-Arctic Lakes Observation Network and include 35 lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Previous studies have shown that concentrations of CH4 in these lakes ranges from 1 – 8 micrograms per liter, with diffusive CH4 fluxes between 2 to 500 g CH4 per minute. Measured ebulliative fluxes range from 100 to 5000 g CH4 per minute.",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards present a great opportunity for the increased exposure of contemporary geosciences into the K-12 curricula of most of the countries school. However, the manner by which the NGSS are being adopted by different schools and districts poses several challenges. So far, 13 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted the NGSS in full, accounting for about 30% of the nation’s students. In addition, four states (Massachusetts, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and West Virginia), accounting for another 5% of U.S. students, have adopted new state science standards that are adapted from the NGSS, each in different ways. For West Virginia, language concerning climate change has been tempered. For Oklahoma and South Dakota, language concerning climate change has been nearly entirely removed. In addition, there are a large number of independent school districts, accounting for at least and additional 35% of the nation’s students, that are in the process of designing curriculum aligned to some degree with the NGSS. These are in states that have either not yet adopted the NGSS or likely will never adopt the NGSS (at a state-wide level). This presents a challenge to the geosciences, because the level of geoscience content will greatly vary, state-to-state and district-to-district. The NGSS present the geosciences with a heavy emphasis on Earth Systems Science, particular as it relates to climate systems and human impacts on systems, but most K-12 teachers have not had exposure to the geosciences in these contexts, and will require significant professional development. In addition, the inclusion of a full year of geoscience content in high school (in addition to a year for middle school), presents another curricular challenge, as most schools have never taught this amount of geoscience to all of its students (the NGSS are designed to have all of its standards taught to all students). The NGSS also emphasizes learning through a set of 8 different practices, many involving the direct analysis and interpretation, often in a quantitative way, with real data and evidence, and while there are great opportunities here, the implementation will be difficult. There are several different models for incorporating the geoscience content in high school, and different districts are likely to vary greatly in its implementation.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have described a slow-down in the rise in global mean temperature over the past 15 years, noting that these trends are anomalous with respect to the trends predicted by the CMIP5 ensemble. This result has been shown to be sensitive to the choice of starting year when assessing the hiatus with a simple linear regression. It is also sensitive to assumptions about the independence of CMIP5 ensemble members when estimating distributions of the CMIP5 ensemble. We address these interdependences of ensemble members by exploring two end-member scenarios of the CMIP5 ensemble: one in which each ensemble member is assumed independent and a second in which modeling centers are assumed independent. A more stable metric of trend, the\nδ\n-slope, is employed to measure the recent divergence of a temperature time-series from the average CMIP5 projection. When treating each CMIP5 ensemble member as independent, we find that observed recent trends are anomalous for all hiatus periods starting after 1997 at the 95\n%\nconfidence level. However, for the scenario assuming modeling centers to be independent, we find that observed recent trends are consistent with the CMIP5 ensemble at the 95\n%\nconfidence level. This result holds across all plausible hiatus starting years tested (1990-2005). Using the Ansari-Bradley rank-sum test, seven modeling centers comprising 58 ensemble members are each shown to have lower spread in\nδ\n-slope values than the distribution of\nδ\nslope values of CMIP5 ensemble members outside each modeling center at the 95\n%\nconfidence level. This supports the end-member scenario that treats each modeling center as independent. In addition, examination of spatial patterns of\nδ\n-slope in each CMIP5 ensemble member reveals that the simulation that is closest to observations in global mean temperature\nδ\n-slope value also has one of the highest\nδ\n-slope spatial pattern correlations with observations. This pattern reflects a strong negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and further supports the notion that the recent period of warming is captured by the CMIP5 ensemble.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms through which the climate system responds to orbital insolation changes requires establishing the timing of events imprinted on the geological record. In this study, we investigate the relative timing of the glacial terminations across the equatorial Pacific in order to identify a possible mechanism through which the tropics may have influenced a global climate response. The relative termination timing between the eastern and western equatorial Pacific was assessed from 15 published SST records based on Globigerinoides ruber Mg/Ca or alkenone thermometry. The novelty of our study lies in the accounting of the various sources of uncertainty inherent to paleoclimate reconstruction and timing analysis. Specifically, we use a Monte-Carlo process allowing sampling of possible realizations of the time series that are functions of the uncertainty of the benthic δ18O alignment to a global benthic curve, of the SST uncertainty, and of the uncertainty in the change point, which we use as a definition for the termination timing. We find that the uncertainty on the relative timing estimates is on the order of several thousand years, and stems from age model uncertainty (60%) and the uncertainty in the change point detection (40%). Random sources of uncertainty are the main contributor, and, therefore, averaging over a large datasets and/or higher resolution records should yield more precise and accurate estimates of the relative lead-lag. However, at this time, the number of records is not sufficient to identify any significant differences in the timing of the last three glacial terminations in SST records from the Eastern and Western Tropical Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing subsurface properties, particularly hydraulic conductivity, is crucial for reliable and cost-effective groundwater supply management, contaminant remediation, and emerging deep subsurface activities such as geologic carbon storage and unconventional resources recovery. With recent advances in sensor technology, a large volume of hydro-geophysical and chemical data can be obtained to achieve high-resolution images of subsurface properties, which can be used for accurate subsurface flow and reactive transport predictions. However, subsurface characterization with a plethora of information requires high, often prohibitive, computational costs associated with \"big data\" processing and large-scale numerical simulations. As a result, traditional inversion techniques are not well–suited for problems that require coupled multi-physics simulation models with massive data.\nIn this work, we apply a scalable inversion method called Principal Component Geostatistical Approach (PCGA) for characterizing heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) distribution in a 3-D sand box. The PCGA is a Jacobian-free geostatistical inversion approach that uses the leading principal components of the prior information to reduce computational costs, sometimes dramatically, and can be easily linked with any simulation software. Sequential images of transient tracer concentrations in the sand box were obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, resulting in 6 million tracer-concentration data [Yoon et. al., 2008]. Since each individual tracer observation has little information on the K distribution, the dimension of the data was reduced using temporal moments and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Consequently, 100,000 unknown K values consistent with the scale of MRI data (at a scale of 0.25^3 cm^3) were estimated by matching temporal moments and DCT coefficients of the original tracer data. Estimated K fields are close to the true K field, and even small-scale variability of the sand box was captured to highlight high K connectivity and contrasts between low and high K zones. Total number of 1,000 MODFLOW and MT3DMS simulations were required to obtain final estimates and corresponding estimation uncertainty, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.",

Observations of total ozone following the eruption of El Chichon in the 1980s provided some of the earliest and clearest indications of the importance of volcanic aerosol on ozone depletion. In subsequent decades, improved laboratory information, modeling studies, and observations showed how heterogeneous chemical processing on and in volcanic aerosols could enhance chlorine-catalyzed ozone loss in the lower stratosphere, while decreasing nitrogen-catalyzed ozone loss in the upper stratosphere. Recent satellite observations shed important light on this chemistry but major gaps in understanding remain, including for example a lack of knowledge of whether hydrochloric acid can be efficiently taken up in stratospheric particles under cold conditions, interactions and competition between volcanic aerosols and ice clouds, and the effects of volcanic aerosols on chemistry in the tropopause region. Effects of volcanic aerosols on Arctic and Antarctic ozone depletion are also subject to many certainties, owing in large part to observational deficiencies. Implications for gaining an improved understanding through both laboratory studies and new observations will be briefly described.",

            "abstract": "We will show observations of waveform bursts using the Electric Field and Waves (EFW) burst data on the Van Allen Probes satellites with intermediate frequency waves such as whistler mode, magnetosonic and lower hybrid. These observations show very strong modulation of these waves by lower frequency waves such as EMIC or ULF. We are analyzing the burst data and cross coupling between wave modes to determine how prevalent the cross coupling between wave modes is and under what conditions it occurs. To supplement the EFW data, each satellite is also equipped with a full complement of particle instruments, including the HOPE instrument measuring lower energy (1 eV – 50 keV) particles and MagEIS instruments measuring higher energy (20 keV – 5 MeV) particles. The energy and angular resolution of these detectors are sufficient to resolve the scattering and energization arising from the distinct wave modes, using the signatures in the trapped electron populations predicted by theory for the various mechanisms. Comparison of the burst waveform data with the electron data from HOPE and MagEIS, for times with and without coupling between the wave modes, will allow us to identify how the cross coupling affects electron dynamics in the radiation belts.\nThe significance of wave-particle interactions in the formation and depletion of the radiation belts has long been established, but is still not completely understood. Specifically, pitch angle scattering from waves such as plasmaspheric hiss and electromagnetic ion cyclotron [EMIC] waves near the duskside plasmapause is known to contribute to electron loss from the radiation belts, primarily through precipitation into the atmosphere. Higher frequency waves such as whistler mode chorus and magnetosonic waves observed near the equator in the lower hybrid frequency range are widely believed to be primary means for electron energization. However, these and other competing processes often occur simultaneously, and an accurate model of radiation belt dynamics must account for the relative influence of all these processes over time. Additionally, analysis of the coupling between wave modes over the course of auroral storms and substorms, periods of extremely complex interaction and energy transfer, could increase our understanding of storm time radiation belt dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Very low permeability is a principal reason salt formations are considered viable hosts for disposal of nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. Granular salt is likely to be used as back-fill material and a seal system component. Salt formation pressures will promote reconsolidation of granular salt, eventually resulting in low permeabilities, comparable to native salt. Understanding the consolidation processes, dependent on the stress state, moisture availability and temperature, is important for demonstrating sealing functions and long-term repository performance. As granular salt consolidates, initial void reduction is achieved by brittle processes of grain rearrangement and cataclastic flow. At porosities less than 10%, grain boundary processes and crystal-plastic mechanisms govern further porosity reduction. When present, fluid assists in grain boundary processes and recrystallization. Fluid inclusions are typically found in abundance within bedded salt crystal structure and along grain boundaries, but are rarely observed internal to domal salt grains. We have observed fluid canals and evidence of moisture along grain boundaries in domal salt. In this research, we investigate grain boundary moisture in granular salt that has been reconsolidated under high temperatures to relatively low porosity. Mine-run salt from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and Avery Island was used to create cylindrical samples, vented and unvented, which were reconsolidated at 250°C and stresses to 20 MPa. Unvented reconsolidation retains essentially all the grain boundary moisture as found ubiquitously on scanning electron photomicrographs of consolidated samples which revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of canals from residual moisture. This contrasts significantly with the vented samples, which had virtually no grain boundary moisture after consolidation. Microstructural techniques include scanning electron, stereo-dynascopic, and optical microscopy. The observations will be used to support evaluation of a constitutive model for reconsolidating granular salt to be used to predict thermal-mechanical-hydrologic responses of salt repository seal structures and backfilled rooms.",

            "abstract": "With its global coverage and all-weather imaging capability, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has become an increasingly important technique for studying magma dynamics at volcanoes in remote regions, such as the Aleutian Islands. The spatial distribution of surface deformation derived from InSAR data enables the construction of detailed mechanical models to aid the investigation of magmatic processes. We processed nearly 12,000 SAR images of Aleutian volcanoes acquired by ERS-1, JERS-1, ERS-2, Radarsat-1, Envisat, ALOS, and TerraSAR-X from the early 1990s to 2010. We combined these SAR images to produce about 25,000 interferograms, which we analyzed for evidence of surface deformation at most of the arc’s Holocene volcanoes. This talk summarizes deformation processes at Aleutian volcanoes observed with InSAR, including: (1) time-varying volcanic inflation and magmatic intrusion, (2) deformation preceding and accompanying seismic swarms , (3) persistent volcano-wide subsidence at calderas that last erupted tens of years ago, (4) episodic magma intrusion and associated tectonic stress release, (5) subsidence caused by a decrease in pore fluid pressure in active hydrothermal systems, (6) subsidence of surface lava and pyroclastic flows, and (7) a lack of deformation at some volcanoes with recent eruptions, where deformation might be expected. Our work demonstrates that deformation patterns and associated magma supply mechanisms at Aleutian volcanoes are diverse and vary in both space and time. By combining InSAR results with information from the geologic record, accounts of historical eruptions, and data from seismology, petrology, gas geochemistry, and other sources, we have developed conceptual models for the magma plumbing systems and behaviors of many volcanoes in the Aleutian arc. We realize that these models are simplistic, but it is our hope that they will serve as foundations that will be refined as additional information becomes available.",

On-going field studies in representative aquatic habitats on the central Amazon floodplain are combining monthly measurements of carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere with deployment of meteorological sensors and high-resolution thermistors and optical dissolved oxygen sensors. A real-time cavity ringdown spectrometer is being used to determine the gas concentrations; vertical profiles were obtained by using an equilibrator to extract gases from water, and floating chambers are used to assess fluxes. Gas fluxes varied as a function of season, habitat and water depth. Greatest carbon dioxide fluxes occurred during high and falling water levels. During low water, periods with high chlorophyll, indicative of phytoplankton, the flux of carbon dioxide switched from being emitted from the lake to being taken-up by the lake some of the time. The highest pCO2 concentration (5500 µatm) was about three times higher than the median (1700 µatm). Higher CO2 fluxes were observed in open water than in areas with flooded or floating vegetation. In contrast, methane fluxes were higher in vegetated regions. We measured turbulence as rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy based on microstructure profiling. Comparison of these measurements with those calculated from meteorological and time series measurements validated new equations for turbulent kinetic energy dissipation (TKE) rates during moderate winds and cooling and illustrated that the highest dissipation rates occurred under heating. Measured gas exchange coefficients (k600) were similar to those based on the TKE dissipation rates and are well described using the surface renewal model. These k values are several times higher than previous values applied to regional extrapolations in the Amazon basin and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "The NASA spaceborne Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission is a constellation of 8 microsatellites focused on tropical cyclone (TC) inner core process studies. CYGNSS will be launched in October 2016, and will use GPS-Reflectometry (GPS-R) to measure ocean surface wind speed in all precipitating conditions, and with sufficient frequency to resolve genesis and rapid intensification. Here we present a modified and improved version of the current baseline Level 2 (L2) wind speed retrieval algorithm designed for CYGNSS. An overview of the current approach is first presented, which makes use of two different observables computed from 1-second Level 1b (L1b) delay-Doppler Maps (DDMs) of radar cross section. The first observable, the Delay-Doppler Map Average (DDMA), is the averaged radar cross section over a delay-Doppler window around the DDM peak (i.e. the specular reflection point coordinate in delay and Doppler). The second, the Leading Edge Slope (LES), is the leading edge of the Integrated Delay Waveform (IDW), obtained by integrating the DDM along the Doppler dimension. The observables are calculated over a limited range of time delays and Doppler frequencies to comply with baseline spatial resolution requirements for the retrieved winds, which in the case of CYGNSS is 25 km. In the current approach, the relationship between the observable value and the surface winds is described by an empirical Geophysical Model Function (GMF) that is characterized by a very high slope in the high wind regime, for both DDMA and LES observables, causing large errors in the retrieval at high winds. A simple mathematical modification of these observables is proposed, which linearizes the relationship between ocean surface roughness and the observables. This significantly reduces the non-linearity present in the GMF that relate the observables to the wind speed, and reduces the root-mean square error between true and retrieved winds, particularly in the high wind regime. The modified retrieval algorithm is tested using GPS-R synthetic data simulated using an End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) developed for CYGNSS, and it is then applied to GPS-R data from the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) GPS-R experiment. An analysis of the algorithm performances for both synthetic and real data is illustrated.",

We show all-sky, 5-55 keV ENA H maps from the year 2003 to 2014 and compare the solar cycle variation of the ENAs in both the heliospheric nose (upstream) and anti-nose (downstream) directions with the > 30 keV ions measured within the heliosheath by the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) detector on Voyagers 1, 2 (V1, V2) where we measure protons in overlapping energy bands ~30-55 keV. We find that a) Toward the anti-nose direction the ENA-H intensities decline during SC23, i.e. after 2003 ENA intensities decreased by ~ x2 at all energies by the end of year 2011, ~1 year after the observed minimum in solar activity; b) This ENA decrease (5.2-55 keV) during 2009-2011 is consistent with the concurrent intensity decrease of the > 30 keV ions (by a factor of 2-3) observed in situ by V1 and V2 in the heliosheath; c) Toward the nose direction, minimum intensities in both INCA ENAs and the V2 ions at E > 28 keV occur during the year 2013, with a subsequent recovery from 2014 to date (by a factor of ~2 in the > 35 keV ENA data). These quantitative correlations between the decreases of INCA ENAs (in both the heliospheric nose and anti-nose directions) and the in situ V1 and V2 ion measurements (separated by > 130 AU) during the declining phase of SC23, along with their concurrent jointly shared recoveries at the onset of SC24, imply that: 1) the 5-55 keV ENAs are produced in the heliosheath (because their transit times over 100 AU are less than a few months at energies > 40 keV), thus proving that our ENA observations can provide the ground truth for constructing comprehensive global heliosphere models; 2) the global heliosheath responds promptly (within ~1-1.5 yrs) to outward-propagating solar wind changes throughout the solar cycle.",

A dynamical dust grain tracing code is used to establish relative dust grain densities and three-dimensional velocity distributions in the outer solar system for four main sources of dust grains: Jupiter-family comets, Halley-type comets, Oort-Cloud comets, and Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt objects. Model densities are constrained by in-situ dust measurements by the New Horizons Student Dust Counter, the Pioneer 10 meteoroid detector, and the Galileo Dust Detection System (DDS). The model predicts that Jupiter-family comet grains dominate the interplanetary dust grain mass flux inside approximately 10 AU, Oort-Cloud cometary grains may dominate between 10 and 25 AU, and Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt grains are dominant outside 25 AU. The model also predicts that while the total interplanetary mass flux at Jupiter roughly matches that inferred by the analysis of the Galileo DDS measurements, mass fluxes to Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are at least one order-of-magnitude lower than that predicted by extrapolations of dust grain flux models from 1 AU. We present modeled mass fluxes to various moons, atmospheres, and ring systems of the outer planets.",

            "abstract": "Advances in observational systems and reduction in their cost are allowing us to explore, monitor, and digitally represent our environment in unprecedented details and over large areas. Low cost in situ sensors, unmanned autonomous vehicles, imaging technologies, and other new observational approaches along with airborne and space borne systems are allowing us to measure nearly everything, almost everywhere, and at almost all the time. Under the aegis of observatories they are enabling an integrated view across space and time scales ranging from storms to seasons to years and, in some cases, decades. Rapid increase in the convergence of computational, communication and information systems and their inter-operability through advances in technologies such as semantic web can provide opportunities to further facilitate fusion and synthesis of heterogeneous measurements with knowledge systems. This integration can enable us to break disciplinary boundaries and bring sensor data directly to desktop or handheld devices. We describe CyberInfrastructure effort that is being developed through projects such as Earthcube Geosemantics (\nhttp://geosemantics.hydrocomplexity.net\n), (SEAD (\nhttp://sead-data.net/\n), and Browndog (\nhttp://browndog.ncsa.illinois.edu/)s\no that data across all of earth science can be easily shared and integrated with models. This also includes efforts to enable models to become interoperable among themselves and with data using technologies that enable human-out-of-the-loop integration. Through such technologies our ability to use real time information for decision-making and scientific investigations will increase multifold. The data goes through a sequence of steps, often iterative, from collection to long-term preservation. Similarly the scientific investigation and associated outcomes are composed of a number of iterative steps from problem identification to solutions. However, the integration between these two pathways is rather limited. We describe characteristics of new technologies that are needed to bring these processes together in the near future to significantly reduce the latency between data, science, and agile and informed actions that support sustainability.",

Voigt, DLR, et al.) in Europe and for ACCESS II in California (B. Anderson, NASA, et al.) in March-May 2014. The model uses NWP data from ECMWF and past airtraffic data (actual traffic data are used for analysis). The forecasts provided a sequence of hourly forecast maps of contrail cirrus optical depth for 3.5 days, every 12 h. CoCiP has been compared to observations before, e.g. within a global climate-aerosol-contrail model (Schumann, Penner et al., ACPD, 2015, doi:10.5194/acpd-15-19553-2015). Good predictions would allow for climate optimal routing (see, e.g., US patent by Mannstein and Schumann, US 2012/0173147 A1).\nThe predictions are tested by: 1) Local eyewitness reports and photos, 2) satellite observed cloudiness, 3) autocorrelation analysis of predictions for various forecast periods, 4) comparisons of computed with observed optical depth from COCS (doi:10.5194/amt-7-3233-2014, 2014) by IR METEOSAT-SEVIRI observations over Europe. The results demonstrate medium-range predictability of contrail cirrus to a useful degree for given traffic, soot emissions, and high-quality NWP data. A growing set of satellite, Lidar, and in-situ data from ML-CIRRUS and ACCENT are becoming available and will be used to further test the forecast quality.\nThe autocorrelation of optical depth predictions is near 70% for 3-d forecasts for Europe (outside times with high Sahara dust loads), and only slightly smaller for continental USA.\nContrail cirrus is abundant over Europe and USA. More than 1/3 of all cirrus measured with the research aircraft HALO during ML-CIRRUS was impacted by contrails. The radiative forcing (RF) is strongly daytime and ambience dependent. The net annual mean RF, based on our global studies, may reach up to 0.08 W/m2 globally, and may well exceed 1 W/m2 regionally, with maximum over Europe. Hence, any mean to reduce the climate impact of aviation contrails may be important. Local RF values along a given flight route are far larger in magnitude and may be positive and negative and change strongly for small route changes, hence offer larger potential for mitigation.",

            "abstract": "A transect of shale sites was established across the Northern Hemisphere as part of the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO) to investigate the role of climate in shale weathering. Mean annual temperature and precipitation vary across sites located in Wales, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Puerto Rico. Long-term weathering rates were quantified by comparing bulk soil geochemistry with original parent shale composition and cosmogenic 10Be inventories to estimate weathering duration. Present-day weathering rates were obtained by burying approximately 2 cm by 1 cm shale chips at multiple depths in soil pit walls. Shale chip samples were exhumed after two and five years of burial, washed and mass loss measured. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to determine surface chemistry and physical alteration of the recovered shale. Long-term weathering rates increase with increasing temperature across the transect. Similarly, after two years of burial, exhumed shale chip weathering rates increased from 2.9 ± 0.9 in Wales to 11.2 ± 3.7 m Ma-1 in Puerto Rico. Average weathering rates after two years of burial were similar in Virginia, Tennessee and Alabama (8.6 – 10.6 m Ma-1). Many shale chips in Alabama and Puerto Rico, however, retained soil particles even after washing, therefore total mass loss, and thus weathering rates, at these sites could be even greater. After five years of burial, mass loss across the Appalachian sites was greatest in Tennessee while weathering rates were overall generally similar to two year rates (3.0 to 12.6 m Ma-1). Evidence of physical and chemical changes, especially Na and Mg loss, from shale chip surfaces was greater on shale chips buried at warmer and wetter sites. Quantifying weathering rates as a function of climate at multiple scales will contribute to understanding the effects of global climate change on soil formation rates in the Critical Zone.",

            "abstract": "Land-Atmosphere interactions–their strength, directionality and evolution–are one of the main sources of uncertainty in contemporary climate modeling. A particularly crucial role in sustaining and modulating land-atmosphere interaction is the one of aerosols and dusts. Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred micrometers in diameter. Furthermore, the amount of dust and fog in the atmosphere is an important measure of visibility, which is another dimension of land-atmosphere interactions. Visibility affects all form of traffic, aviation, land and sailing. Being able to predict the change of visibility in the air in advance enables relevant authorities to take necessary actions before the disaster falls. Time Series Analysis (TAS) method is an emerging technique for modeling and forecasting the behavior of land-atmosphere interactions, including visibility.\nThis research assess the dynamics and evolution of visibility around Abu Dhabi International Airport (+24.4320 latitude, +54.6510 longitude, and 27m elevation) using mean daily visibility and mean daily wind speed. TAS has been first used to model and forecast the visibility, and then the Transfer Function Model has been applied, considering the wind speed as an exogenous variable. By considering the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a statistical criteria, two forecasting models namely univarite time series model and transfer function model, were developed to forecast the visibility around Abu Dhabi International Airport for three weeks. Transfer function model improved the MAPE of the forecast significantly.",

            "abstract": "The present study examines the role of different mechanisms as precursors for ENSO diversity by analyzing high-quality satellite observations of several key variables for the past 27 years, complemented by subsurface information from ocean reanalysis (GODAS, SODAsi). Our objective is to clarify the relative importance of large-scale atmospheric forcing from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as tropical atmospheric noise and ocean background conditions in triggering different ENSO types, thus providing insights in the event predictability and possible lead times.\nThis investigation uses an extensive suite of ocean satellite retrievals from microwave sensors, radiometers and scatterometers, all intercalibrated and consistently processed at Remote Sensing Systems. The satellite data record of wind speed, columnar water vapor, cloud water, and precipitation begins in 1988 with the first SSMI. Through-clouds SST observations started in 1998 with TMI. Wind vectors observations started with the scatterometer QuikSCAT in 1999. All of these variables have now been continuously monitored and processed to a high accuracy level, suitable for climate studies, and are available at high frequency, twice daily for each instrument, and at a fine spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees.\nWe first examine the large-scale extra-tropical precursors in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and their relative influence in triggering each El Niño/La Niña event during the satellite era. We then consider the role played by atmospheric noise in the form of Westerly Wind Bursts (WWBs) in triggering different event types, and the possible interplay of the WWB activity and extra-tropical influences. In particular, the relationship of the WWB amplitude and longitudinal evolution with the location of the eastern edge of the Warm Pool is examined over the total length of the satellite record. Special attention is devoted to the evolution of equatorial Pacific conditions during 2014/2015, which is examined in the context of previous ENSO events.",

While we mapped the rupture and measured vertical displacement of up to 80 cm at the field, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) shows densely spaced fringes on the hanging wall side, suggesting westward or uplift movement associated with thrust faulting. The mainshock focal mechanism and aftershock hypocenters indicate the source fault dips to the east but the InSAR images cannot exactly differentiate between horizontal and vertical movements and also lose coherence within and near the fault zone itself. To reveal near-field deformation and shallow fault slip, here we demonstrate a differential LiDAR analysis using a pair of 1 m-resolution pre-event and post-event bare Earth digital terrain models (DTMs) obtained from commercial LiDAR provider. We applied particle image velocity (PIV) method incorporating elevation change to obtain 3-D vectors of coseismic displacements (Mukoyama, 2011, J. Mt. Sci). Despite sporadic noises mostly due to local landslides, we detected up to 1.5 m net movement at the tip of the hanging wall, more than the field measurement of 80 cm. Our result implies that a 9-km-long rupture zone is not a single continuous fault but composed of two bow-shaped fault strands, suggesting a combination of shallow fault dip and modest amount (< 1.5 m) of slip. Eastward movement without notable subsidence on the footwall also supports the low angle fault dip near the surface, and significant fault normal contraction, observed as buckled cultural features across the fault zone. Secondary features, such as subsidiary back-thrust faults confirmed at the field, are also visible as a significant contrast of vector directions and slip amounts.",

            "abstract": "Runoff generation often is a non-linear and hysteretic function of catchment water storage. Storage dynamics, in turn, are notoriously difficult to monitor in a comprehensive way beyond the point scale. Superconducting gravimeters (SG) measure temporal variations of the Earth’s acceleration of gravity with very high precision and temporal resolution. They have been shown to be sensitive to mass variations induced by hydrological processes in their surroundings, typically within a radius of few 100 meters around the instrument. Thus, in turn, SGs are unique instruments for monitoring water storage variations in the landscape in an integrative way, accounting for soil moisture, vadose zone and groundwater storage, snow, and surface water bodies if existent. We present the measurement concept of SGs and expose its value for hydrological process research. We stress limitations, in particular that the hydrological application of SGs so far has often been hindered by the instruments being located in observatory buildings. This infrastructure disturbs the local hydrology and causes many uncertainties due to the often poorly known geometry of the construction, non-natural flow paths of water, and unknown water storage variations below and/or on top of the infrastructure.\nBy deploying the SG in a small enclosure, these disturbances and unknowns are minimized. We report on the first experiences with exposing a SG of the latest generation (iGrav) in a small housing of less than 1 m2 footprint to temperate hydro-meteorological conditions. The system has been set up on a grassland site at the Geodetic Observatory in Wettzell, Bavarian Forest, Germany, in early 2015. We present the technical layout and challenges in running the gravimeter system. Additionally, we report on the quality of data acquired so far and present comparisons to in-situ soil moisture monitoring with TDR and TOMST sensors, a lysimeter, and groundwater observations. We discuss the value of SG observations for estimating water storage variations, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge beyond the point scale.",

One of these phenomena is the evolution of magnetic reconnection. Switch-on effects have been described earlier for magneto-/hydrodynamic (MHD and HD) simulations, where oscillations are ignited by the initial condition and the usual instantaneous way of starting a simulation run. Here we revisit the GEM setup (a Harris current sheet) and demonstrate the immediate generation of oscillations propagating perpendicular to the magnetic shear layer (in Bz). Also we show how these oscillations do not dissipate quickly and will later be mode-converted to generate wave power, first in By, much later also in Bx (pointing along the shear direction). One needs to take care not to interpret these oscillations as physical wave modes associated with the nature of reconnection. We propose a method to prevent such switch-on effects from the beginning, that should be considered for implementation in other PIC simulation codes as well.",

            "abstract": "The impact of changes in the frequency and severity of drought on fresh water sustainability is a great concern for many regions of the world. One such location is the High Plains, where the local economy is primarily driven by fresh water withdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer, which accounts for approximately 30% of total irrigation withdrawals from all U.S. aquifers combined. Modeling studies that focus on the feedback mechanisms that control the climate and eco-hydrology during times of drought are limited, and have used conventional General Circulation Models (GCMs) with grid length scales ranging from one hundred to several hundred kilometers. Additionally, these models utilize crude statistical parameterizations of cloud processes for estimating sub-grid fluxes of heat and moisture and have a poor representation of land surface heterogeneity. For this research, we focus on the 2012 High Plains drought and perform numerical simulations using three single column model (SCM) versions of BUGS5 (Colorado State University (CSU) GCM coupled to the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB3)). In the first version of BUGS5, the model is used in its standard bulk setting (single atmospheric column coupled to a single instance of SiB3), secondly, the Super-Parameterized Community Atmospheric Model (SP-CAM), a cloud resolving model (CRM) (CRM consists of 32 atmospheric columns), replaces the single CSU GCM atmospheric parameterization and is coupled to a single instance of SiB3, and for the third version of BUGS5, an instance of SiB3 is coupled to each CRM column of the SP-CAM (32 CRM columns coupled to 32 instances of SiB3). To assess the physical realism of the land-atmosphere feedbacks simulated by all three versions of BUGS5, differences in simulated energy and moisture fluxes are computed between the 2011 and 2012 period and are compared to those calculated using observational data from the AmeriFlux Tower Network for the same period at the ARM Site in Lamont, OK. This research will provide a better understanding of model deficiencies in reproducing and predicting droughts in the future, which is essential to the economic, ecologic and social well being of the High Plains.",

To address this issue, a controlled release experiment is undertaken at the Borden research aquifer, Ontario, Canada. Due to low solubility, it is expected that the injection will lead to gas exsolution and ebullition. Gas migration is expected to extend to the unsaturated zone and towards the ground surface, and may possibly be affected by CH4 oxidation. The project consists of multiple components targeting the saturated zone, unsaturated zone, and gas emissions at the ground surface. This presentation will focus on the analysis of surficial CO2 and CH4 effluxes and vadose zone gas composition to track the temporal and spatial evolution of fugitive gas. Surface effluxes are measured with flux chambers connected to a laser-based gas analyzer, and subsurface gas samples are being collected via monitoring wells equipped with sensors for oxygen, volumetric water content, electrical conductivity, and temperature to correlate with changes in gas composition. First results indicate rapid migration of CH4 to the ground surface in the vicinity of the injection locations. We will present preliminary data from this experiment and evaluate the distribution and rate of gas migration.

The park has numerous Native American sites that are vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal erosion, part of which may be influenced by Cascadia interseismic deformation. Efforts at removal of exotic beach grass (Ammophila arenaria) that stabilizes most of the dune complex have begun; vegetation removal will remobilize the dunes and could obscure and also expose near surficial geologic features. Using a LiDAR base to capture extant data and give context to future resource protection projects, I surficially mapped the dunes and provisionally interpreted, tsunamigenically-derived cobbles (which are more than five feet thick in one road cut exposure) that extensively mantle the deflation plain in the lee of the foredune. Natural, test pit and auger exposures helped characterize fluvial and marsh deposits in the southern bank and floodplain of the Smith River. Optically stimulated luminescence and/or radiocarbon dates constrain the ages for cobble deposits and dunes throughout the park, and liquefaction features exposed in the southern bank of the Smith River. In combination with estimated rates of dune formation and migration at TDSP since the A.D. 1700 Cascadia earthquake, the ages for seismogenically-sourced sediment associated with dune ridges and cobble deposits are tentatively correlated with the ages of latest Holocene Cascadia triggered turbidites dated by Goldfinger et al. (2012) on the Smith River platform. The mapping also helped identify a marine terrace sequence on the southern limb of the northwest-trending Lake Earl Syncline that bifurcates the park, and suggests projection of the northwest-trending Cemetery Scarp, part of the Point St. George fault complex (Polenz and Kelsey 1999), through the southern part of the park.",

Using local earthquakes, 3-D Qp and Qs crustal models have been obtained for this region which includes the San Andreas fault system, the Central Valley, the Sierra Nevada batholith, and the Mendocino subduction volcanic system. Path attenuation t* values were determined from P and S spectra of 959 spatially distributed earthquakes, magnitude 2.5-6.0 from 2005-2014, using 1254 stations from NCEDC networks and IRIS Mendocino and Sierra Nevada temporary arrays. The t* data were used in Q inversions, using existing hypocenters and 3-D velocity models, with basic 10-km node spacing. The uneven data coverage was accounted for with linking of nodes into larger areas in order to provide useful Q images across the 3-D volume. The results at shallow depth (< 2 km) show very low Q in the Sacramento Delta, the Eureka area, and parts of the Bay Area. In the brittle crust, fault zones that have high seismicity exhibit low Q. In the lower crust, low Q is observed along fault zones that have large cumulative displacement and have experienced grain size reduction. Underlying active volcanic areas, low Q features are apparent below 20-km depth. Moderately high Q is associated with igneous rocks of the Sierra Nevada and Salinian block, while the Franciscan subduction complex shows moderately low Q. The most prominent high Q feature is related to the Great Valley Ophiolite.",

            "abstract": "The equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) is significant ionospheric phenomena caused by the so-called fountain effect, which is driven by a zonal eastward electric field. This process involves the altitudinal coupling, electrodynamics and inhomogeneity of ionospheric plasma densities in the equatorial and low latitude regions. Not only eastward electric field, but neutral winds also play a role in controlling the actual configuration of the EIA. In the present study, an attempt is made to reveal the effect of the longitudinal variability of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) strengths associated with eastward electric field and meridional neutral winds for the generation and control of the asymmetries on EIA crests of TEC (Total Electron Content) about the magnetic equator in the American sector. Our results show that as EEJ is stronger (weaker), EIA crests are formed farther (closer) from equator on the western (eastern) side of South America. A physics-based numerical model is used to study the effects of daytime meridional neutral winds and EEJ on consequent evolution of asymmetry in equatorial TEC anomalies during afternoon and onwards. This result implies that the electric field associated with the EEJ together with meridional neutral winds may play a key role in the development of observed asymmetries of EIA crests and dictate the shape, size, amplitude and separation of the EIA crests as seen through ionospheric TEC distribution measured using GPS (Global Positioning System) in the low latitudes ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP, 3.3–2.9 Ma), with reconstructed atmospheric pCO2 of 350–450 ppm, represents a potential analogue for climate change in the near future. Current highly cited estimates place MPWP maximum global mean sea level (GMSL) at 21 ± 10 m above modern, requiring total loss of the Greenland (GIS) and marine West Antarctic Ice Sheets (WAIS) and a substantial loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), with only a concurrent 2–3 ºC rise in global temperature. Many estimates of Pliocene GMSL are based on the partitioning of oxygen isotope records from benthic foraminifera (δ18Ob) into changes in deep-sea temperatures and terrestrial ice sheets. These isotopic budgets are underpinned by the assumption that the δ18O of Antarctic ice (δ18Oi) was the same in the Pliocene as it is today, and while the sensitivity of δ18Ob to changing meltwater δ18O has been previously considered, these analyses neglect conservation of 18O/16O in the ocean-ice system. Using well-calibrated δ18O-temperature relationships for Antarctic precipitation along with estimates of Pliocene Antarctic surface temperatures, we argue that the δ18Oi of the Pliocene Antarctic ice sheet was at minimum 1‰–4‰ higher than present. Assuming conservation of 18O/16O in the ocean-ice system, this requires lower Pliocene seawater δ18O (δ18Osw) without a corresponding change in ice sheet mass. This effect alone accounts for 5%–20% of the δ18Ob difference between the MPWP interglacials and the modern. With this amended isotope budget, we suggest that Pliocene GMSL was likely 9–13.5 m and very likely 5-17 m above modern, which suggests the EAIS is less sensitive to radiative forcing than previously inferred from the geologic record.",

A new generation of low-earth orbiting (LEO) sounders complimented by geostationary sounders over North America, Europe, and Asia providing a unique opportunity to quantify the current and future trajectory of emissions and their impact on global pollution. We examine the potential of this constellation of air quality sounders to quantify the role of local and non-local sources of pollution on background ozone in the US. Based upon an adjoint sensitivity method, we quantify the role synoptic scale transport of non-US pollution on US background ozone over months representative of different source-receptor relationships. This analysis allows us distinguish emission trajectories from megacities, e.g. Beijing, or regions, e.g., western China, from natural trends on downwind ozone. We subsequently explore how a combination of LEO and GEO observations could help quantify the balance of local emissions against changes in distant sources . These results show how this unprecedented new international ozone observing system can monitor the changing structure of emissions and their impact on global pollution.",

            "abstract": "Surface reflectance is one of the key products from VIIRS and as with MODIS, is used in developing several higher-order land products. The VIIRS Surface Reflectance (SR) IP is based on the heritage MODIS Collection 5 product (\nVermote et al. 2002\n). The quality and character of surface reflectance depends on the accuracy of the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) and aerosol algorithms and of course on the adequate calibration of the sensor. Early evaluation of the VIIRS SR product in the context of the maturity of the operational processing system known as the Interface Data Processing System (IDPS), has been a major focus of work to-date, but is now evolving into the development of a VIIRS suite of Climate Data Records produced by the NASA Land Science Investigator Processing System (SIPS). We will present the calibration performance and the role of the surface reflectance in calibration monitoring, the performance of the cloud mask with a focus on vegetation monitoring (no snow conditions), the performance of the aerosol input used in the atmospheric correction with quantitative results of the performance of the SR product over AERONET sites. Based on those elements and further assessment, we will address the readiness of the SR product for the production of higher-order land products such as Vegetation Indices, Albedo and LAI/FPAR, the its application to agricultural monitoring and in particular the integration of VIIRS data into the global agricultural monitoring (GLAM) system developed at UMd. Finally from the lessons learned, we will articulate a set of critical recommendations to ensure consistency and continuity of the JPSS mission with the MODIS data record.",

            "abstract": "As is well known from the remote sensing of minerals, absorption features in infrared spectra can change drastically with changes in particle size. These changes are the product of two competing effects: volume scattering where increasing particle size leads to a net increase in absorption, and surface scattering where increasing particle size decreases net absorption. Depending on the relative contribution of volume and surface scattering, absorption features can appear as troughs in reflectivity spectra (volume scattering), sharp peaks (surface scattering), or may disappear out right.\nSolid ice has a significant absorption feature near 12 microns, that is a candidate for the retrieval of snow morphology from infrared remote sensing. In this presentation, we first overview a new phenomenological theory of the reflectivity of particulate media, with an emphasize on different regimes of scattering behavior. We then investigate the 12 micron feature of pure snow and snow containing black carbon, with an emphasize on how this feature is expected to change with changes in snow grain size, and with varying amounts of black carbon.",

            "abstract": "During the past decade, rifting events and episodes have provided new insights about the mechanisms that generate ground deformation, faulting and eruptions at divergent plate boundaries. However, our knowledge is still limited on, for example, the influence of pre-existing structures, the relations between dike intrusions and seismicity, and about near-field deformation. Here we show evidence for oblique rift opening related to a graben collapse during a rifting event originating from the Bárðarbunga caldera (central Iceland). This event led to the largest basaltic eruption in Iceland for more than 200 years. From seismicity and high-resolution radar imagery (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) we reveal the timing and kinematics of the graben formation and other near-field deformation. We use radar amplitude image offsets and earthquake fault plane solutions (over the same period) to show that significant left-lateral shear took place in addition with the opening across the graben. This suggests that pre-existing fracture zone and two centuries of far-field strain accumulation controlled the intrusion pathway. Our results imply that pre-existing fracture zones, which are rarely considered in dike propagation studies, play a key role in controlling both rift opening obliquity and fault plane rupture geometries.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of groundwater (GW) budgets and effective management of agricultural GW pumping remains a challenge in much of California’s Central Valley (CV) due to a lack of irrigation well metering. CVHM and C2VSim are two regional-scale integrated hydrologic models that provide estimates of historical and current CV distributed pumping rates. However, both models estimate GW pumping using conceptually different agricultural water models with uncertainties that have not been adequately investigated. Here, we evaluate differences in distributed agricultural GW pumping and recharge estimates related to important differences in the conceptual framework and model assumptions used to simulate surface water (SW) and GW interaction across the root zone. Differences in the magnitude and timing of GW pumping and recharge were evaluated for a subregion (~1000 mi2) coincident with Yolo County, CA, to provide similar initial and boundary conditions for both models. Synthetic, multi-year datasets of land-use, precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and SW deliveries were prescribed for each model to provide realistic end-member scenarios for GW-pumping demand and recharge. Results show differences in the magnitude and timing of GW-pumping demand, deep percolation, and recharge. Discrepancies are related, in large part, to model differences in the estimation of ET requirements and representation of soil-moisture conditions. CVHM partitions ET demand, while C2VSim uses a bulk ET rate, resulting in differences in both crop-water and GW-pumping demand. Additionally, CVHM assumes steady-state soil-moisture conditions, and simulates deep percolation as a function of irrigation inefficiencies, while C2VSim simulates deep percolation as a function of transient soil-moisture storage conditions. These findings show that estimates of GW-pumping demand are sensitive to these important conceptual differences, which can impact conjunctive-use water management decisions in the CV.",

            "abstract": "In 1964, the “Good Friday Earthquake” ruptured a 800 km-long segment of the Alaskan-Aleutian Subduction Zone (AASZ), representing the largest measured earthquake in North America (Mw 9.2). Lake sediments potentially record such large earthquakes, since seismic shaking can generate subaquatic mass-wasting deposits. Several short cores, high-resolution seismic (3.5 kHz) and multibeam (50khz) data were collected in Eklutna, Skilak and Kenai Lakes in southern Alaska. The data reveal the presence of sublacustrine landslides related to the 1964 earthquake. The seismic profiles also show a succession of older landslide deposits in the subsurface. It has been shown that earthquake shaking with intensities of > VII can trigger such landslides and as such they are useful for paleoseismology research, especially in low-seismicity regions. In high-seismicity regions (e.g. southcentral Chile), however, the turbidite record has shown to be a much more sensitive seismometer, because frequent and strong seismic shaking is under-represented in landslide deposits in the lake records. Eklutna, Skilak and Kenai lakes are also located in a high-seismicity setting (the Prince William Sound segment of the AASZ), but they exhibit significantly larger sedimentation rates (4 mm/yr), potentially reducing the effect of under-representation.\nOur multilake approach allows us to compare landslide records between lakes with different characteristics: low slope gradients and sedimentation rates cause under-representation of the landslides in Skilak Lake with respect to other independent paleoseismic records, while steeper slopes and higher sedimentation rates in Eklutna Lake produce more frequent event deposits, potentially thus resulting in a more precise sedimentary archive of past earthquake events.\nMultiple lake records will also help us understand segment boundaries of megathrust earthquakes. This is crucial for inferring information on variability between ruptures and interplate coupling.",

Given the breadth of potential science and engineering topics that excite children, the RETINA Program focuses on interactive participation in the design and development of simple robotic and sensor systems, providing a range of challenges to engage students through project-based learning (PBL). Thus, young students experience scientific discovery through the use and understanding of technology. This groundwork serves as the foundation for SSROV Camp, a week-long, summer day camp for 6th-8th grade students. The camp is centered on the sensors and platforms that guide seafloor exploration and discovery and builds upon the notion that transformative discoveries in the deep sea result from either sampling new environments or making new measurements with sensors adapted to this extreme environment. These technical and scientific needs are folded into the curriculum. Each of the first four days of the camp includes four team-based, hands-on technical challenges, communication among peer groups, and competition. The fifth day includes additional activities, culminating in camper-led presentations to describe a planned mission based on a given geologic setting. Presentations include hypotheses, operational requirements and expected data products. SSROV Camp was initiated last summer for three sessions, two in Monterey, CA and one in Oxford, MS. Campers from both regions grasped key elements of the program, based on written responses to questions before and after the camp. On average, 32% of the pre-test questions were answered correctly compared with 80% of the post-test questions. Additional confirmation of gains in campers’ knowledge, skills, and critical thinking on environmental issues and engineering problems were apparent during the “jeopardy” competition, nightly homework, and mission presentations. On the basis of this successful effort, we hope to expand to other towns.",

            "abstract": "It has been widely observed that earthquakes can be triggered due to changes in stress induced by the passage of surface waves from remote earthquakes. These stress changes are typically on the order of a few kiloPascals and occur over time spans of seconds. Less well investigated is the question of whether triggering of seismic activity can result from similar stress changes occurring over periods of hours or days due to changing barometric pressure, rainfall, and Earth tides. Past studies have shown a possible link between these stress sources and slow earthquakes in Taiwan (Hsu et al., 2015).\nHere, we investigate the relationship between seismicity and changing barometric pressure, Earth tides, and rainfall for four regions of the western United States where regional seismic networks provide high-quality seismic catalogs over relatively long time periods: Southern California, Northern California, the Pacific Northwest, and Utah. For each region we obtained seismic catalogs from January 2001 through September 2014 and acquired hourly data for barometric pressure and rainfall across the regions from the National Climatic Data Center. The vertical stress time series due to Earth tides was computed for the location of each weather station in the study areas. We summed the stresses from these 3 sources and looked for variations in seismicity correlated to the stress changes.\nWe show that seismicity rates increase with increasing magnitude of stress change. In many cases the increase in seismicity is larger for reductions in vertical stress than it is for stress increases. We speculate that the dependency of seismic rate on combined vertical stress is acting through a combination of two mechanisms: (1) Reduced stresses reduce the normal force on faults, triggering failure in critically-stressed faults. (2) Increased stresses may similarly reduce the normal force on faults due to increases in pore pressure induced in the fault region.",

            "abstract": "Discrimination between snow and clouds poses a serious but tractable challenge to the consistent delivery of high-quality information on mountain snow from remote sensing. Clouds obstruct the surface from the sensor’s view, and the similar optical properties of clouds and snow make accurate discrimination difficult. We assess the performance of the current Landsat 8 operational snow and cloud mask products (LDCM CCA and CFmask), along with a new method, using over one million manually identified snow and clouds pixels in Landsat 8 scenes. The new method uses physically based scattering models to generate spectra in each Landsat 8 band, at that scene’s solar illumination, for snow and cloud particle sizes that cover the plausible range for each. The modeled spectra are compared to pixels’ spectra via several independent ways to identify snow and clouds. The results are synthesized to create a final snow/cloud mask, and the method can be applied to any multispectral imager with bands covering the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared regions. Each algorithm we tested misidentifies snow and clouds in both directions to varying degrees. We assess performance with measures of Precision, Recall, and the F statistic, which are based on counts of true and false positives and negatives. Tests for significance in differences between spectra in the measured and modeled values among incorrectly identified pixels help ascertain reasons for misidentification. A cloud mask specifically designed to separate snow from clouds is a valuable tool for those interested in remotely sensing snow cover. Given freely available remote sensing datasets and computational tools to feasibly process entire mission histories for an area of interest, enabling researchers to reliably identify and separate snow and clouds increases the usability of the data for hydrological and climatological studies.",

            "abstract": "Mantle pyroxenites play an important role in models on melt petrogenesis at mid-ocean ridges and ocean islands. Thus their study can give extremely valuable insights on mantle heterogeneity and deep melting and melt transport processes but only a limited number of studies exist. A recent study on pyroxenites sampled at the Lena Trough showed that measuring the elemental composition of minerals within pyroxenites can give important information on their formation processes and associated pressures and temperatures.\n Here we build on this recent study by working on fresh plagioclase-bearing pyroxenites from the nearby Gakkel Ridge, Arctic Ocean. Very little has been published on abyssal pyroxenites and plagioclase-bearing pyroxenites in particular, and the ability to contrast our results – including estimates of formation pressures and temperatures – with pyroxenites from a nearby ridge is particularly useful. In this study we determined the chemical and modal composition of three samples of plagioclase-bearing pyroxenites dredged within the Sparsely Magmatic Zone.\nThese samples are particularly fresh, allowing a detailed study of mineral compositional variation and their textural context. Different generations of pyroxene can be identified and plagioclase occurs as rims around spinel, pl-opx symplectites and lamellae in and around clinopyroxene and crosscutting olivines.\nMineral compositions are variable within a given thin section and distinctly different from pyroxenites from Lena Trough. We established temperature and pressure conditions under which the samples likely formed using mineral equilibria and single mineral thermometers; we then compared and contrasted the studied samples with published data from other plagioclase pyroxenites and peridotites. Pressure estimates show that plagioclase formation occurred shallower relative to Lena Trough but comparable to pyroxenites from the Southwest Indian Ridge.",

            "abstract": "We undertook zircon U–Pb dating and analyzed major and trace elements and zircon Hf isotope compositions of Late Cambrian to Middle Devonian igneous and metasedimentary rocks in central Jilin Province, NE China, in order to constrain the Early–Middle Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the south-eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB),. Zircon U–Pb dating indicates that the Early–Middle Paleozoic magmatism in central Jilin Province can be divided into four episodes: Late Cambrian (ca. 493 Ma), Middle Ordovician (ca. 467 Ma), Late Ordovician–Early Silurian (ca. 443 Ma), and Late Silurian–Middle Devonian (425–396 Ma). The progression from subduction initiation to maturity is recorded by Late Cambrian low-K tholeiitic meta-diabase and ultramafic rocks, Middle Ordovician medium-K calc-alkaline pyroxene andesite, and Late Ordovician to Early Silurian low-K tonalite, which all formed in an evolving supra-subduction zone setting. Late Silurian to Middle Devonian igneous rocks contain granodiorite, monzogranite, rhyolite, dacite, and trachydacite, show progressively increasing K2O contents, from medium K to shoshonite series. Furthermore, the Early–Middle Devonian monzogranites were generated by the melting of thickened lower crust. These results suggest a transition from subduction to post-orogenic setting during the Late Silurian–Middle Devonian. Overall, we suggest that Late Cambrian tholeiitic meta-diabase and ultramafic rocks, Middle Ordovician pyroxene andesite, and Late Ordovician–Early Silurian tonalite formed above the northward-subducting and simultaneously seaward-retreating of Paleo-Asian Ocean plate. Subsequently, the northern arc collided with the North China Craton and post-orogenic extension probably occurred during the Late Silurian–Middle Devonian.\nThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (grant: 2013CB429802) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant: 41172057).",

            "abstract": "Ten years ago, the Global Energy and Water EXchanges Global Land Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE) spotlighted the Southern Great Plains (SGP) for being one of three hotspots globally for land-derived precipitation predictability. Since then, the GLACE results have served as the underlying motivation for numerous subsequent land-atmosphere (L-A) coupling studies over the SGP domain. The range of these studies includes: local point scale studies leveraging surface meteorological and flux measurements at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement SGP (ARM-SGP) Central Facility, regional pentad to monthly scale atmospheric moisture budget analyses based on atmospheric reanalysis, and regional limited duration (2-7 day) coupled model sensitivity experiments. This study has the following three objectives: (1) to provide the common historical context necessary for bridging past and future interdisciplinary characterizations of L-A coupling, (2) to isolate the mechanism(s) for the region’s L-A coupling signal, and (3) to evaluate the short range (12-18hr) predictability of soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks. We produce a convective triggering potential—low-level humidity index (CTP-HI)—based climatology of L-A coupling at ARM-SGP for the period 1979-2014 using North American Regional Reanalysis and North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 data. We link the underlying coupling regime classification timeseries to corresponding synoptic-mesoscale weather patterns and bulk atmospheric moisture budget analyses. On the whole, the region’s precipitation variability is largely dependent on large-scale moisture transport and the role of the land is nominal. However, we show that surface sensible heat flux can play an important role in modulating diurnal precipitation cycle phase and amplitude—either directly (enhancing CTP) in water-limited conditions or indirectly (increasing HI) in energy-limited conditions. In fact, both 0700 LT soil moisture and 1300 LT sensible heat flux are significantly correlated with afternoon peak (AP) precipitation occurrence and amplitude. To finish, we evaluate retrospectively the predictability of AP precipitation events during summer 2015 considering only early morning meteorological parameters.",

            "abstract": "Tropical peatland burning activities in Southeast Asia, which can keep smouldering for a long time, have been becoming rather frequent during the last few decades. These combustions have released huge amounts of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles into the atmosphere, contributing large uncertainties to the global radiative forcing estimation. In addition, the gas and aerosol particles emitted from the peat-fire have caused environmental and human health issues. These regional and global impacts are closely tied to water uptake properties of aerosol particles, which alter their physical and chemical characteristics. However, hygroscopic property of peat burning aerosol particles has rarely been investigated. Here, we utilized a self-built Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA) to measure diameter growth factors of fresh peat burning particles, which were generated during laboratory peat combustion experiments under controlled conditions. Particle number size distribution and chemical composition were also measured using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and the Time of Flight - Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ToF-ACSM). Number size distribution demonstrated a bimodal pattern, with the mode diameters in the size ranges of 50-80 nm and 300-500 nm, respectively. The corresponding normalized volume size distribution was unimodal distributed with mode diameter at around 400-600nm. Water uptake of freshly emitted peat smoke aerosol particles was less hygroscopic, probably because fresh peat burning aerosol particles were predominantly composed of organic compounds and sulfates were negligible. The obtained information can be further applied into the studies on the influence of peat burning aerosol particles on regional and global climate.",

            "abstract": "Episodic depressurization-pressurization cycles of Kīlauea Volcano’s shallow magma system cause variations in ground deformation, eruption rate, and surface height of the active summit lava lake. The mechanism responsible for these pressure-change cycles remains enigmatic, but associated monitoring signals often show a quasi-exponential temporal history that is consistent with a temporary reduction (or blockage) of supply to Kīlauea’s shallow magma storage area. Regardless of their cause, the diverse signals produced by these deflation-inflation (DI) cycles offer an unrivaled opportunity to constrain properties of an active volcano’s shallow magma reservoir and relation to its eruptive vents.\nWe model transient behavior at Kīlauea Volcano using a simple mathematical model of an elastic reservoir that is coupled to magma flux through Kīlauea’s East Rift Zone (ERZ) at a rate proportional to the difference in pressure between the summit reservoir and the ERZ eruptive vent (Newtonian flow). In this model, summit deflations and ERZ flux reductions are caused by a blockage in supply to the reservoir, while re-inflations occur as the system returns to a steady-state flux condition. The model naturally produces exponential variations in pressure and eruption rate which reasonably, albeit imperfectly, match observations during many of the transient events at Kīlauea.\nWe constrain the model using a diverse range of observations including time-varying summit lava lake surface height and volume change, the temporal evolution of summit ground tilt, time-averaged eruption rate derived from TanDEM-X radar data, and height difference between the summit lava lake and the ERZ eruptive vent during brief eruptive pauses (Patrick et al., 2015). Formulating a Bayesian inverse and including independent prior constraint on magma density, host rock strength, and other properties of the system, we are able to place probabilistic constraints on the volume and volatile content of shallow magma storage, as well as properties of the ERZ conduit and influx of magma into Kīlauea’s shallow magma reservoir. Reservoir influx parameters cannot in general be uniquely resolved, but reservoir volume and exsolved volatile content are well constrained; ERZ conduit radius may also be estimated given some simplifying assumptions.",

We provide the first estimate of the width Δ of the tropospheric interhemispheric transit-time distribution (TTD). We find that Δ has a value of ~1.3 years that varies little with SH latitude, compared to the mean transit time Γ that increases from ~1.1 years in the SH tropics to ~1.4 years at the South Pole. The TTD shape parameter Δ/Γ is thus larger in the SH tropics than at mid and high SH latitudes. Our analysis introduces a simple path-dependent lifetime that parameterizes chemical losses. The path-dependent lifetimes are estimated for CFC replacements and systematic differences between path-dependent and global lifetimes are interpreted. The path-dependent lifetimes have the potential to provide new observational constraints on tropospheric and stratospheric loss processes.",

            "abstract": "Radon and radon progeny are the most important contribution to dose from natural sources of radiation. Most studies have demonstrated an increased risk of lung cancer at high concentration of radon for the public. Radon potential map is an essential approach for radon risk assessment.\nThe radon potential map is based on the measured data of soil gas radon concentration and soil air permeability, combined with GIS technology, in Zhongshan City in the Southern China. The preliminary radon survey in ZC was conducted using a portable semiconductor radon monitor RAD-7 and soil air permeability instrument Rad-jok, covering a total area of 1800 km2. The sampling depth for soil gas radon measurement in the field was at the depth of 80 cm below the ground. 222Rn activity concentrations varyed between 0.74 and 158 kBq/m3, and 220Rn between 0.02 and 235 kBq/m3 in soil gas. The average value of 222Rn and 220Rn was 67.6 and 74.8 kBq/m3, respectively. The results show that: (1) the characteristics and distributions of 222Rn/220Rn concentration from soil gas in ZC are obviously related with local lithology (the Middle and the Late Jurassic and the Cretaceous biotitic-granite) and geological formation. High 222Rn/220Rn concentrations were observed in soil gas in the outcrops of weathered granite or filled back granite sands. (2) The distribution model of 220Rn is as same as that of 222Rn. The Wuguishan Mountain areas and in the south-east areas of ZC, covering with granite rocks, are high radon risk districts; the central zones in ZC are low radon potential areas, and part of the northern districts are medium radon potential areas.

            "abstract": "Until recently, “peak oil” was regarded as imminent. Now, however, the recent rapid increase in US oil and gas production from shale exploitation has delayed peak oil. This delay raises grave climate concerns. The development of new technologies (such as horizontal drilling) means that enormous unconventional reserves distributed worldwide may be readily recoverable, with large negative consequences on the global greenhouse gas emissions trajectory. If even a small portion of these unconventional reserves were exploited, it is highly likely that limiting global Earth warming to 2ºC, a goal being discussed for COP 21, will be impossible. Instead, tipping points in the climate system will likely be reached, with serious effects, including greatly accelerated ice melting, leading to large and unstoppable global sea level rise.\n The enthusiasm for shale gas stems in part from its potential role as a bridge fuel to wean the country from coal until low-carbon alternatives come into full play. However, shale gas and oil production entail direct adverse environmental impacts (air and water pollution, induced earthquakes and public health risks) that are only now coming to light. Gas production through fracking also has severe impacts on climate through the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that leaks from production sites. In intensive fracking regions, high methane concentrations are measured on the ground and are now detectable in satellite data.\nProponents of gas fracking argue that with the right policies to protect communities and the environment, natural gas can be harnessed as part of a broad climate strategy. But opponents of gas fracking believe that no regulation will be adequate to protect communities and the local environment. They also fear that natural gas produced through fracking will delay progress toward a carbon-free future.\nWe will explore the consequences for the global climate of exploiting these very large oil and gas resources.",

Having up to 31 events per day, the columns of ash reached an altitude between 4500 and 7000 masl. Each event frequently averaging between 50 and 500 meters from about 442 or 48% of the total events this period. The reports of falling ash came from as far as the city of Salamanca at 278 km to the NE.\nThe intense activity destroyed the original dome forming a new one with an elliptical crater 224 m by 166 m and 35 m deep.\nOn May 15 we observed the growth of a new dome. On July 4, this created the falling of rocks along the slopes and the formation of three Andesitic lava flows at the N, SW and S flanks.\nBy July 11 the volume of lava extruded was about 6 x106 m3, with a rate extrusion of 1.21 m3per sec.\n2. Based on three flyby observations, it was noted that the lava flows on the S and SW sectors had a higher extrusion rate in the N sector. The first two were placed on a slope with an average gradient of 36º, while on the northern slope gradient is 23º, as a result of the interaction of extrusion speed, slope and height of the lava front, there were constant landslides, causing at least 4 Merapi type pyroclastic flows, that flowed by the gullies of Montegrande and San Antonio. The first flow reached distances of 7 km and 10.4 km. It is the largest lava flow recorded since January 20, 1913.\nThe devastating results were the burning of 500 meters of the Templado Forest, burning along the Montegrande Creek and finally affecting many crops and livestock. This type of activity already had shown in 1975 and 1991 by the lava flow and S NE flank where the pyroclastic flows had no destructive effects, except for some small fires in forested areas at the base of the volcano (Thorpe, et al, 1977).\nIn March 1903 Colima volcano showed similar activity per Arreola J. and Diaz Severo, who reported a formation of an amphitheater opening to the E, while now on July 11, 2015 an amphitheater was formed towards the S sector.\nThe similarity in the evolution process of these eruptions allows us to frame the question: At the end of this fourth cycle of activity of Colima volcano, are we very close to a large subplinian or Plinian eruption such as it occurred in the years 1611, 1818 and 1913?",

However, environmentally sustainable livestock intensification, one of the key goals pursued by Plano ABC (the federal government low carbon agriculture plan), strongly depends on our ability to more precisely identify pasture conditions, improvement needs, and the respective cattle support capacities. To this end, and with the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, we have concentrated efforts in order to have: 1) a more detailed and updated map of the brazilian pasturelands; 2) a thorough biophysical differentiation of these pastures according to degradation stages / forage levels; and 3) an estimation of overall pasture productivity trends. Our initial estimates, based on the interpretation of satellite and census data, suggest that as much as 50% of the total grazing area in Brazil (about 170 Mhectares) are moderately or severely affected by soil-plant degradation. On the other hand, our preliminary results also corroborate the enormous potential of well managed pastures to positively impact carbon and water fluxes. Based on satellite data and pasture samples from large and productive cattle ranch operations in the central savanna biome in Brazil (Cerrado), we estimated total growing season (October to April) biomass and evapotranspiration to correspond to 9 Gt of carbon and 420 Gt of water, respectively.",

We examined the frequency-magnitude relationship for the entire pre-road period and show that the seven largest events fall above a strongly linear relationship, suggesting a distinct process (e.g., severe fires or earthquakes) operating at low-frequency to generate large-magnitude events. Expressing the record as cumulative sediment accumulation anomalies showed the importance of the large events in “returning the system” to the long-term mean rate. Applying frequency-magnitude analysis in a moving window showed that the Q100 and Q10 of watershed erosion varied by 1.7 and 1.0 orders of magnitude, respectively. The variations in watershed erosion are weakly correlated with temperature and precipitation reconstructions at the decadal to centennial scale. This suggests that dynamics both internal (i.e., sediment production) and external (i.e., earthquakes) to the system, as well as more stochastic events (i.e., single severe wildfires) can at least partially over-ride external climate forcing of watershed erosion at decadal to centennial time scales.",

            "abstract": "The Laurentian Great Lakes are a key component of the weather and climate system of the northern and eastern United States through their influences on atmospheric circulation and the availability of moisture. The differences in temperature between the lake surface, land, and atmosphere control a number of small-scale atmospheric circulations in the region. During the spring and early summer months, the lakes are typically colder than the air due to density driven circulations in the lake as well as the high heat capacity of water. This colder water surface helps to generate a stable layer of air, which controls the flow of moisture and momentum over and around the lakes. The stable layer’s strength and location plays a key role in both the placement of precipitation generated downwind of the lakes and the potential suppression of existing convective systems. In this study, precipitation promotion and suppression processes will be explored through a series of high-resolution (< 4 km horizontal grid spacing) Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulations with varying lake surface characteristics. Sensitivity of individual events to changes in the lake surface properties is examined, and the results illustrate how the dynamics and intensity of storms may change in a warmer climate.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: In seismic exploration for metal deposits, the traditional seismic inversion method based on layered homogeneous medium theory seems difficult to inverse small scale inhomogeneity and spatial variation of the actual medium. The reason is that physical properties of actual medium are more likely random distribution rather than layered. Thus, it is necessary to investigate a random medium inversion algorithm. The velocity of 2D random medium can be described as a function of five parameters: the background velocity (V0), the standard deviation of velocity (σ), the horizontal and vertical autocorrelation lengths (A and B), and the autocorrelation angle (θ). In this study, we propose an inversion algorithm for random medium based on the Fuzzy C-means Clustering (FCM) theory, whose basic idea is that FCM is used to control the inversion process to move forward to the direction we desired by clustering the estimated parameters into groups. Our method can be divided into three steps: firstly, the three parameters (A, B, θ) are estimated from 2D post-stack seismic data using the non-stationary random medium parameter estimation method, and then the estimated parameters are clustered to different groups according to FCM; secondly, the initial random medium model is constructed with clustered groups and the rest two parameters (V0 and σ) obtained from the well logging data; at last, inversion of the random medium are conducted to obtain velocity, impedance and random medium parameters using the Conjugate Gradient Method. The inversion experiments of synthetic seismic data show that the velocity models inverted by our algorithm are close to the real velocity distribution and the boundary of different media can be distinguished clearly.\nKey words: random medium, inversion, FCM, parameter estimation",

            "abstract": "How surface topography is supported at depth is a long-standing question in geodynamics. Overall, the western United States (US) stands high compared to the North American craton, but it has remained a challenge to distinguish crustal and mantle support of this topography due to the complex tectonic history of the western US and inadequate knowledge of crustal structure.\nWe provide new seismological constraints on crustal structure using virtual deep seismic sounding (VDSS). VDSS uses SV-to-P wave conversion at the free surface near each seismograph as a virtual source, which, in turn, generates a strong, post-critical reflection off the Moho. This signal remains robust even if the Moho is complex or transitional in nature. Compared to traditional receiver functions, VDSS is less prone to contamination by scattering from other crustal structures, such as thick sediments or intra-crustal discontinuities. More important, VDSS can provide simultaneous constraints on both the total thickness and the overall P-wave speed of the crust – two key parameters for estimating the crustal contribution to isostasy.\nBased on data from USArray (EarthScope), we estimate the residual topography (that is, the difference between observed elevation and that predicted from the Airy model given the inferred crustal structure) in the western US (Figure 1). Positive values, indicative of mantle-supported topography, are wide spread in the Great Basin, the southern Rocky Mountains, the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone system, and the High Lava Plains. The periphery of the Colorado Plateau, the Central Sierra Nevada batholith, and the Idaho batholith also show positive residual topography. In contrast, our analysis suggests that thick crust in the interior of the Colorado Plateau and the Wyoming craton provides more than enough support for the topography, consistent with a thick, cold lithospheric root below.",

Here, we investigated the δ15N values of surface bulk soil, soil NO3 and plants from six restoration grasslands in two different regions (Yunwu Mountain and Bin County) of the Chinese Loess Plateau to study soil NO3 conversion and transportation in these ecosystems. The soil NO3-δ15N values of Yunwu Mountain ranged from -0.1‰ to 1.3‰, and the soil NO3-δ15N values of Bin County ranged from 1.2‰ to 11.3‰. In our result, (1) the soil NO3-δ15N values increased as plant δ15N values decreased in study areas. Additionally, the bulk soil δ15N values were positively correlated with plant δ15N values. (2) In both study areas, the soil NO3-δ15N values were positively correlated with soil water content. In contrast, the bulk soil δ15N and plant δ15N values were negatively correlated with increasing soil water content. It is shown that soil NO3 is easily absorbed by plants in our study areas, which indicates that NO3 is the primary inorganic N source for grassland plants on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The plants absorbed more 15N-depleted NO3 when soil water content increased. Fallen litter assimilated by the soil produced the positive correlation between bulk soil δ15N values and plant δ15N values, which may explain how the plant-soil N cycle responds to soil water changes and may explain the negative correlation between bulk soil δ15N values and mean annual precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Satellite based estimation of solar-induced terrestrial fluorescence (SIF) is considered to be a direct measure of photosynthetic functional status of the vegetation. Prior studies have shown SIF to more accurately retrieve the productivity of intensively managed croplands, as in the U.S. corn belt. In this study, we assessed and compared agricultural productivity over two intensive crop production regions in Australia and India using SIF data, traditional spectral measures, and crop yield data. Regional level wheat yield data were obtained for the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) in India and the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia for analyses with GOME-2 SIF satellite and MODIS VI measurements, and gross primary productivity from flux towers. We investigated the importance of integrating traditional meteorological parameters and ground based data with time-series vegetation indices for scaling of SIF to obtain robust yield prediction models for application across years and continents. This study further explored the relationship of inter annual variations in crop phenology metrics through SIF retrievals and its relationship with crop yields.\nThe IGP study region showed systematic cycles of double cropping. MDB region on the other hand showed cycles of pronounced winter cropping and a weaker and variable second cropping over the analysis period. For various winter wheat crop seasons in IGP, from 2007 to 2012, SIF explained and accounted between 48 to 74 per cent of the variations in regional wheat yields. Similar results were obtained in the case of MDB also, however, the relationship between SIF and yield estimates was weaker (R2 = 0.44). SIF measurements, as a surrogate of crop productivity, were considerably higher over the highly productive IGP region in almost all the years considered. The SIF data shows immense potential for modelling agricultural productivity, particularly as the resolution of SIF retrievals continues to improve.",

            "abstract": "Studies have shown that estimates of ground motion parameter from ground motion attenuation relationship often greater than the observed value, mainly because multiple ruptures of the big earthquake reduce the source pulse height of source time function. In the absence of real-time data of the station after the earthquake, this paper attempts to make some constraints from the source, to improve the accuracy of shakemaps. Causative fault of Yushu Ms 7.1 earthquake is vertical approximately (dip 83 °), and source process in time and space was dispersive distinctly. Main shock of Yushu Ms7.1 earthquake can be divided into several sub-events based on source process of this earthquake. Magnitude of each sub-events depended on each area under the curve of source pulse of source time function, and location derived from source process of each sub-event. We use ShakeMap method with considering the site effect to generate shakeMap for each sub-event, respectively. Finally, ShakeMaps of mainshock can be aquired from superposition of shakemaps for all the sub-events in space. Shakemaps based on surface rupture of causative Fault from field survey can also be derived for mainshock with only one magnitude. We compare ShakeMaps of both the above methods with Intensity of investigation. Comparisons show that decomposition method of main shock more accurately reflect the shake of earthquake in near-field, but for far field the shake is controlled by the weakening influence of the source, the estimated Ⅵ area was smaller than the intensity of the actual investigation. Perhaps seismic intensity in far-field may be related to the increasing seismic duration for the two events. In general, decomposition method of main shock based on source process, considering shakemap of each sub-event, is feasible for disaster emergency response, decision-making and rapid Disaster Assessment after the earthquake.",

As a consequence of this, the road was closed for nearly a week. In mid May, the Dalton was flooded by the Sag River in several reaches from approximately mile post (MP) 394 to Deadhorse (MP 414). The magnitude of this event, the first recorded since the road was built in 1976, was such that the road was closed for nearly three weeks.

            "abstract": "Microseismic surface waves originating from sources in ocean would propagate along parts of oceanic path before being recorded by on-land seismic stations. Studying the path effects on waveform, travel-time, magnitude and other properties of these microseismic signals is important in accurately determining the location, strength and generating mechanism of the sources. Strong effects are observed in the microseismic signals generated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and verified by synthetic seismograms. We find that Sandy-related seismic signals are significantly affected by oceanic path: only seismic signals share a similar length of oceanic path are cross-correlated and a large portion of the correlated signals can be traced back to sources at the ocean-continent boundary within a narrow azimuthal range from the hurricane center. In this presentation, we report that these observations can be explained by strong path effect of wave propagation from a seismic source in the hurricane center. The strong directionality of waveform cross-correlation can be explained by the propagation effect that waveform characteristics of Rayleigh wave are mostly controlled by transitional propagating path from ocean to the continental region, resulting in seismic signals being correlated only among stations sharing similar length of oceanic path; the sources at the ocean-continent boundary can be attributed to strong seismic scattering in the ocean-continent boundary, generating apparent seismic “sources” there. We also compare the synthetic vertical/transverse magnitude ratio of Rayleigh waves in an anisotropic velocity model with observations. Our results indicate that these types of seismic observations would be particularly useful for studying seismic structure of crust and upper mantle in the ocean-continent area.",

            "abstract": "Pulsating flow, at frequencies ranging from 10-2 to 101 Hz, has been recorded in explosive eruptions through video, thermal imagery, and infrasonic and seismic data. Such pulsating flow can be generated from instabilities in bubbly magma, and from granular instabilities in post-fragmentation conduit flow. Variable fluxes of gas and particles at the vent can alter entrainment conditions, and consequently affect eruption column stability. However, volcanic eruption models typically assume steady flow from the vent, and regime diagrams of eruption column stability are based on such steady flow assumptions. Using Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase numerical simulations of eruption columns with both steady and pulsating sources, we compared the relative behavior of steady and pulsed columns across a range of pulse frequencies and mass fluxes at the vent (mass flux is time-averaged for pulsating cases). Preliminary results suggest that pulsating flow increases air entrainment into the column relative to steady flow for otherwise constant eruption conditions, and that entrainment increases with decreasing pulse frequency. Increased entrainment at low frequency implies that low-frequency pulsed columns are more buoyant and potentially more stable than their steady counterparts, for a given mass flux. This effect disrupts the steady flow-based understanding of eruption column stability regimes and may be a factor to consider for future assessment of volcanic hazards and interpreting mass flux conditions from deposits.",

Rates of change are unprecedented, raising questions about whether (and how) communities will adapt and if responses will reflect synergistic interactions among multiple stressors. Changes to benthic biodiversity on continental margins have important implications for carbon cycle processes and other ecosystem services. One strategy to interpret adaptation potential and predict future faunal change is to examine ecological shifts along natural gradients in the modern ocean. Here, we assess the explanatory power of major climate stressors for macrofaunal diversity and evenness along continental margins using variance partitioning techniques. Sharp drops in diversity are seen as O2 levels decline through the 0.5 – 0.15 ml/l (~22 – 6 μM; ~21 – 5 matm) range, and as temperature increases through the 7-10°C range. pCO2 shows a strong effect in the Arabian Sea but very little effect in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. In contrast, very little variation in evenness is explained by these three global change variables. The identification of sharp thresholds in ecological response are used here to predict seafloor areas most at risk to future marine global change, although the existence of clear regional differences cautions against applying global thresholds.",

The results of this investigation suggested that meaningful temperature changepoints exist below 90F. The local WFO considered a day as \"hot\" when it reached or exceeded 90F unless the day was particularly sunny and humid. Discussions with the local National Weather Service Forecast Office were productive and led to some rethinking of how they consider a \"Hot\" day. The changepoints information was also incorporated into a health impacts report prepared by the Vermont Department of Health for the CDC's Building Resilience Against Climate Effects, by utilizing climate indices tailored to a temperature less than 90F.

Since 2010, we have established a long-term, national monitoring program of drip water infiltration onto cave stalagmites using automated Stalagmate© loggers. Five karst regions, from semi-arid to sub-tropical climates, have been instrumented. Over 200 loggers (between 10 and 40 per cave) have collected data on the timing and amount of drip water infiltration, from sites of contrasting limestone geology. Here, we present results demonstrating the timing and characteristics of drip water discharge from 2010 to present. At the semi-arid Cathedral Cave, with a range of depths from 0-40 m, there is a decreasing frequency of recharge events with depth below ground surface. High-intensity, long-duration rainfall events are confirmed to be the primary driver of infiltration events at semi-arid sites, whereas annual rainfall amount is the primary driver at a Mediterranean climate site with high primary porosity. Inter-annual variability in the frequency and relative amount of drip water infiltration is compared to climate forcing variables such as the ENSO and surface temperature. Our cave observatory system helps improve our understanding of the drip water recharge process, drip-water related speleothem proxy records, and provides a baseline monitoring network for diffuse groundwater recharge during a period of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Both natural climate change and anthropogenic impacts may cause nonstationarities in hydrological ex-tremes. In this study, long-term annual maximum streamﬂow (AMS) records from 145 stations over Canada were used to investigate the nonstationary characteristics of AMS, which include abrupt changes and monotonic temporal trends. The nonparameteric Pettitt test was applied to detect abrupt changes, while temporal monotonic trend analysis in AMS series was conducted using the nonparameteric Mann–Kendall and Spearman tests, as well as a parametric Pearson test. Nonstationary frequency analysis of the AMS series was done using a group of nonstationary probability distributions. The nonstationary characteristics of Ca-nadian AMS were further investigated in terms of the Hurst exponent (H), which represents the long-term persistence (LTP) of streamﬂow data. The results presented here indicate that for Canadian AMS data, abrupt changes are detected more frequently than monotonic trends, partly because many rivers began to be regulated in the twentieth century. Drainage basins that have experienced signiﬁcant land-use changes are more likely to show temporal trends in AMS, compared to pristine basins with stable land-use conditions. The nonstationary characteristics of AMS were accounted for by ﬁtting the data with probability distributions with time-varying parameters. Large H found in almost 2/ 3 of the Canadian AMS dataset indicates strong LTP, which may partly represent the presence of long-term memories in many Canadian river basins. Furthermore, H values of AMS data are positively correlated with the basin area of Canadian rivers. It seems that non-stationary frequency analysis, instead of the traditional stationary hydrologic frequency analysis, should be employed in the future.",

            "abstract": "Currently the ETAS model [Ogata, 1988, JASA] is considered to be a standard model of seismicity. However, because the ETAS model is a purely statistical one, the physics-based seismicity model derived from the rate-and-state friction (hereafter referred to as Dieterich model) [Dieterich, 1994, JGR] is frequently examined. However, the original version of the Dieterich model has several problems in the application to real earthquake sequences and therefore modifications have been conducted in previous studies.\nIwata [2015, Pageoph] is one of such studies and shows that the Dieterich model is significantly improved as a result of the inclusion of the effect of secondary aftershocks (i.e., aftershocks caused by previous aftershocks). However, still the performance of the ETAS model is superior to that of the improved Dieterich model. For further improvement, the mixture of the Dieterich and ETAS models is examined in this study.\nTo achieve the mixture, the seismicity rate is represented as a sum of the ETAS and Dieterich models of which weights are given as k and 1-k, respectively. This mixture model is applied to the aftershock sequences of the 1995 Kobe and 2004 Mid-Niigata sequences which have been analyzed in Iwata [2015]. Additionally, the sequence of the Matsushiro earthquake swarm in central Japan 1965-1970 is also analyzed. The value of k and parameters of the ETAS and Dieterich models are estimated by means of the maximum likelihood method, and the model performances are assessed on the basis of AIC. For the two aftershock sequences, the AIC values of the ETAS model are around 3-9 smaller (i.e., better) than those of the mixture model. On the contrary, for the Matsushiro swarm, the AIC value of the mixture model is 5.8 smaller than that of the ETAS model, indicating that the mixture of the two models results in significant improvement of the seismicity model.",

            "abstract": "The knowledge of plant water use characteristics under changing environmental conditions is essential for ecosystem management and water resources distribution in water-stressed environments. This study was conducted to quantify variations in transpiration and canopy conductance in a shelterbelt in the middle of the Heihe River Basin, China. Sap flow of eight Gansu Poplar trees (Populus gansuensis) with different diameters at breast height (DBH) was measured over three consecutive growing seasons (2012-2014). The evapotranspiration of groundwater via plant use was estimated by the White method, with diurnal water table fluctuations. Results showed that mean sap flow density varied between 30.62 ±11.44 and 101.88 ±28.98 kg m-2 h-1, and it increased linearly with the DBH. Variations of sap flow density were mainly controlled by meteorological factors in addition to water table depth. Average stand transpiration during the growing season was about 4.85 mm day-1, and it had a logarithmic relationship with reference crop evapotranspiration. Precipitation increased stand transpiration, but not at a statistically significant level (p>0.05). The recharge of soil water by irrigation significantly accelerated stand transpiration (p<0.05). Stand transpiration and canopy conductance increased by 27% and 31%, respectively, when soil water conditions changed from dry to wet. Canopy conductance decreased logarithmically with vapor pressure deficit, whereas there was no apparent relationship between canopy conductance and solar radiation. The sensitivity of canopy conductance to vapor pressure deficit decreased under dry soil conditions. Groundwater evapotranspiration (0.6-7.1 mm day-1) was linearly correlated with stand transpiration (1.1-6.5 mm day-1) (R2 = 0.71). During the drought period, approximately 80% of total stand transpiration came from groundwater evapotranspiration. This study highlighted the critical role of irrigation and groundwater for shelterbelts, and might provide the basis for the development of water requirement schemes for shelterbelt growth in arid inland river basins.",

            "abstract": "Kennelly et al. (2013) reported that young plasma injection events observed in Saturn’s nightside magnetosphere and identified from plasma wave signatures are modulated at the period associated with the winter hemisphere. In a system unstable to interchange, radial motion of flux tubes is constrained by the “line-tying” effect of high ionospheric conductance (Southwood and Kivelson, 1989). Slippage of a flux tube would then occur initially in the hemisphere in which the ionospheric conductance is lowest. Saturn’s ionospheric conductances vary not only with season, but also with rotation phase because of the presence of a pattern of rotating field-aligned currents that drive “planetary period oscillations” (Jia and Kivelson, 2012). The conductance should minimize near the center of the downward current region and, at this rotation phase in the winter hemisphere, the growth rate of the instability would be largest, accounting for control by the northern period. With motion starting in the winter hemisphere, the flux tube would develop a tilt of predictable sense and the initial inward motion of the interchanging flux tube would occur at a specific rotation phase of the winter ionosphere. For a subset of the Kennelly events, we found that the tilt and phase are consistent with expectations based on the control of displacement by ionospheric conductance. Many additional young interchange events have been identified by K. K. Khurana [personal communication, 2015] whom we thank for making the list available. We examine this more extensive set of events and use them to investigate the proposed mechanism more fully.\n__________\nJia, X., and M. G. Kivelson (2012), J. Geophys.

            "abstract": "Small scale heterogeneities of subsurface medium can be characterized conveniently and effectively using a few simple random medium parameters (RMP), such as autocorrelation length, angle and roughness factor, etc. The estimation of these parameters is significant in both oil reservoir prediction and metallic mine exploration. Poor accuracy and low stability existed in current estimation approaches limit the application of random medium theory in seismic exploration. This study focuses on improving the accuracy and stability of RMP estimation from post-stacked seismic data and its application in the seismic inversion. Experiment and theory analysis indicate that, although the autocorrelation of random medium is related to those of corresponding post-stacked seismic data, the relationship is obviously affected by the seismic dominant frequency, the autocorrelation length, roughness factor and so on. Also the error of calculation of autocorrelation in the case of finite and discrete model decreases the accuracy. In order to improve the precision of estimation of RMP, we design two improved approaches. Firstly, we apply region growing algorithm, which often used in image processing, to reduce the influence of noise in the autocorrelation calculated by the power spectrum method. Secondly, the orientation of autocorrelation is used as a new constraint in the estimation algorithm. The numerical experiments proved that it is feasible. In addition, in post-stack seismic inversion of random medium, the estimated RMP may be used to constrain inverse procedure and to construct the initial model. The experiment results indicate that taking inversed model as random medium and using relatively accurate estimated RMP to construct initial model can get better inversion result, which contained more details conformed to the actual underground medium.",

Here we describe a previously unrecognized source of dawn-dusk asymmetry in a rapidly rotating magnetosphere. As plasma rotates from dawn to noon on a dipolarizing flux tube, it flows away from the equator at close to the sound speed. As plasma rotates from noon to dusk on a stretching flux tube, it is accelerated back to the equator by centrifugal acceleration at flow speeds typically smaller than the sound speed. Correspondingly, the plasma sheet remains far thicker in the afternoon than in the morning. Using two magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we analyze the forces that account for flows along and across the field in Saturn's magnetosphere and point out analogous effects at Jupiter. Different radial force balance in the morning and afternoon sectors produces net dusk to dawn flow, or equivalently, a large-scale electric field oriented from post-noon to pre-midnight.",

            "abstract": "The use of fossil fuels and fertilizers has increased the amount of biologically reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere over the past century. Tibet is the one of the most threatened regions by nitrogen deposition, thus understanding how its microbial communities function maybe of high importance to predicting microbial responses to nitrogen deposition. Here we describe a short-time nitrogen addition conducted in an alpine steppe ecosystem to investigate the response of functional structure of soil microbial community to multi-level nitrogen addition. Using a GeoChip 4.0, we showed that functional diversities and richness of functional genes were unchanged at low level of nitrogen fertilizer inputs (<20 kg N ha-1 yr-1), but significantly decreased at higher nitrogen fertilizer inputs (>=40 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Detrended correspondence analysis indicated that the functional structure of microbial communities was markedly different across the nitrogen gradients. Most C degradation genes whose abundances significantly increased under elevated N fertilizer were those involved in the degradation of relatively labile C (starch, hemicellulose, cellulose), whereas the abundance of certain genes involved in the degradation of recalcitrant C (i.e. lignin) was largely decreased (such as manganese peroxidase, mnp). The results suggest that the elevated N fertilization rates might significantly accelerate the labile C degradation, but might not spur recalcitrant C degradation. The combined effect of gdh and ureC genes involved in N cycling appeared to shift the balance between ammonia and organic N toward organic N ammonification and hence increased the N mineralization potential. Moreover, Urease directly involved in urea mineralization significantly increased. Lastly, Canonical correspondence analysis showed that soil (TOC+NH4++NO3-+NO2-+pH) and plant (Aboveground plant productivity + Shannon Diversity) variables could explain 38.9% of the variation of soil microbial community composition. On the basis of above observations, we predict that increasing of nitrogen deposition on the Tibetan steppe ecosystem is very likely to change soil microbial community functional structure, with particular effects on microbial C and N-cycling genes and consequently microbe-mediated soil C and N dynamics.",

Recently we extracted tsunami waveforms of the 28 October 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake recoded by the APG and DPG of Cascadia Initiative program (Sheehan et al., 2015, SRL). We applied such dense tsunami observations (48 stations) together with other records from DARTs (9 stations) to characterize the tsunami source. This study is the first study that used such a large number of offshore tsunami records for earthquake source study.\nConventionally the curves of tsunami travel times are drawn backward from station locations to estimate the tsunami source region. Here we propose a more advanced technique called tsunami back-projection to estimate the source region. Our image produced by tsunami back-projection has the largest value or tsunami centroid that is very close to the epicenter and above the Queen Charlotte transform fault (QCF), whereas the negative values are mostly located east of Haida Gwaii in the Hecate Strait. By using tsunami back-projection we avoid picking initial tsunami phase which is a necessary step in the conventional method that is rather subjective.\nThe slip distribution of the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake estimated by tsunami waveform inversion shows large slip near the trench (4-5 m) and also on a plate interface southeast the epicenter (3-4 m) below QCF. From the slip distribution, the calculated seismic moment is 5.4 × 1020 N m (Mw 7.8). The steep bathymetry offshore Haida Gwaii and the horizontal movement caused by the earthquake possibly affects the sea surface deformation. The potential tsunami energy calculated from the sea-surface deformation of pure faulting is 2.20 × 1013 J, while that from the bathymetry effect is 0.12 × 1013 J or about 5% of the total potential energy. The significant deformation above the steep slope is confirmed by another tsunami inversion that disregards fault parameters.",

The statistical study of Bouhram et al. 2005 has shown that heavy ions could dominate the magnetopause for as much as 30% of the time on the dusk side. Thus the influence of heavy ions in solar wind-magnetosphere coupling should not be neglected. However, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) linear theory for KHI does not include any ion effects, and people working on the heavy ion effects have not come to an agreement either. Whether the heavy ions promote or inhibit the KHI still remains not well addressed. With a two-dimensional hybrid model, we investigated the effects of ion mass number on the KHI growth rate, starting from the simplest case of uniform density and uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the shear flow. It is shown that the growth rate of the KHI is lower with a heavier mass number. We try to to derive the linear theory for the kinetic KHI and compare it with the hybrid simulation results. The linear theory with ion effects considered is going to be further verified with varying heavy ion fractions and finite magnetic shear. More implications for the dawn-dusk asymmetry of KHI on planetary magnetopause are desirable when comparing the results of opposite magnetic field directions relative to the flow vorticity.",

As a result, increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs via cultivation of nitrogen-fixing crops and application of fertilizer and manure have altered the terrestrial-aquatic N cycle. Anthropogenic perturbations to the N cycle propagate through the ecosystem, impacting downstream freshwater and coastal life, terrestrial and riverine N2O emissions, and carbon cycling throughout the system. We used the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory LM3-TAN (Terrestrial-Aquatic Nitrogen) model to simulate anthropogenic influences on nitrogen losses across terrestrial and riverine systems in South America from 1700 to 2050. The model’s representation of ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes captures the transport and transformation of nitrogen throughout the vegetation-soil-river continuum, enabling a more comprehensive accounting of nitrogen losses than previous estimates. We find that land-use and land-management changes increase nitrogen losses and explore the difference in regional patterns between the Amazon and La Plata basins. We highlight the importance of biological fixation and demonstrate that historical changes in nitrogen losses have been more driven by the type of crop introduced than by the amount of fertilizer used.",

Human impacts also affect riparian vegetation patterns. Human- induced changes include introduction of exotic species, diversion of water for human use, channelization of the river to protect property, and other land use changes that can lead to deterioration of the riparian ecosystem. This study explored the use of remote sensing to map an iconic stretch of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. The pre-dam riparian zone in the Grand Canyon was affected by annual floods from spring run-off from the watersheds of Green River, the Colorado River and the San Juan River. A pixel-based vegetation map of the riparian zone in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, was produced from high-resolution aerial imagery. The map was calibrated and validated with ground survey data. A seven-step image processing and classification procedure was developed based on a suite of vegetation indices and classification subroutines available in ENVI Image Processing and Analysis software. The result was a quantitative species level vegetation map that could be more accurate than the qualitative, polygon-based maps presently used on the Lower Colorado River. The dominant woody species in the Grand Canyon are now saltcedar, arrowweed and mesquite, reflecting stress-tolerant forms adapted to alternated flow regimes associated with the river regulation.",

            "abstract": "We trapped gas bubbles emitted from the seafloor into oil-containing collector and observed an unique phenomena. Gas hydrate formation needs water for the crystal lattice; however, gas hydrates in some areas are associated with hydrophobic crude oil or asphalt. In order to understand gas hydrate growth in oil-bearing sediments, an experiment with cooking oil was made at gas hydrate stability condition. We collected venting gas bubbles into a collector with canola oil during ROV survey at a gas hydrate area in the eastern margin of the Sea of Japan. When the gas bubbles were trapped into collector with oil, gas phase appeared above the oil and gas hydrates, between oil and gas phase. At this study area within gas hydrate stability condition, control experiment with oil-free collector suggested that gas bubbles emitted from the seafloor were quickly covered with gas hydrate film. Therefore it is improbable that gas bubbles entered into the oil phase before hydrate skin formation. After the gas phase formation in oil-containing collector, the ROV floated outside of hydrate stability condition for gas hydrate dissociation and re-dived to the venting site. During the re-dive within hydrate stability condition, gas hydrate was not formed. The result suggests that moisture in the oil is not enough for hydrate formation. Therefore gas hydrates that appeared at the oil/gas phase boundary were already formed before bubbles enter into the oil. Hydrate film is the only possible origin. This observation suggests that hydrate film coating gas hydrate was broken at the sea water/oil boundary or inside oil. Further experiments may contribute for revealing kinetics of hydrate film and formation.

            "abstract": "Lagrangian ocean circulation and biological dynamics are numerically studied in Todos Santos Bay during the spring of 2007. This period is particularly interesting after an intense toxic algal bloom occurred in April 2007 in this area, which was associated with the wind-driven upwelling in the region. High resolution, numerical model simulations were carried out to study dynamical features along of the Southern California Bight (SCB), the coast of the northern Baja California (BC), and the interior of Todos Santos Bay (TSB). These simulations are used in a three-dimensional Lagrangian (particle tracking) analysis which provides information about the origin and distribution of the waters present in the Bay during the occurrence of the toxic bloom. After the selection of trajectories of particles showing coherent patterns, a Nitrate-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD) lower trophic model is implemented to study the influence of the environmental conditions that occur during the particle advection, solving the NPZD equations at every time-varying position of the advected particles. The model is also modified for phytoplankton growth as a function of the environmental temperature to somehow emulate the life cycle of Pseudo-nitzschia. The analysis of the trajectories shows that particles mainly come from two regions: from the north, in the southern portion of SCB and from regions west of the TSB. Knowing the regional circulation patterns and their phytoplankton dynamics can help to understand and even predict the origin and destination of the harmful algal blooms that occur in TSB and its surroundings.",

            "abstract": "Urban environments exhibit unique biogeochemistry due to the presence of a myriad of anthropogenic sources of contaminants. One potential route through which humans have been exposed to metal contaminants is the ingestion of food produced on urban soils. The Inland Empire is a metropolitan located in semi-arid region of Southern California with greater than 4 million residents, where the growing population is demonstrating an increase in citizen participation in contributing to expanding local food systems. In response to the demand for locally grown produce, the Inland Empire is undergoing rapid land use change, where large tracts of land on the periphery of cities, including Riverside, are being converted or set aside for urban agriculture, though the quality of the soil for food production is unknown. At the same time, smaller gardens and farms are growing in number within the more densely populated areas. Assessing the quality of urban soil currently used for food production in this region can aid in projecting how land use change will affect the quality of crops produced as urban agriculture continues to expand in arid regions. Soil samples were taken from a variety of land use types, including areas currently producing crops and areas set aside for future large scale food production. Samples were collected at the surface (0-2 cm) and below till depth (20-22 cm). These soils were analyzed for total carbon including organic and inorganic carbon fractions, total nitrogen, bulk metal and trace metal concentrations (including As, Mn, Cr, Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu). To approximate the mobility of the trace elements under various conditions, extraction tests were also performed, including EPA Pb bioavailability analysis. Finally, we utilize statistical tools and spatial analysis to illustrate the relationship between previous land use, current land use, and soil quality for urban crop production.",

            "abstract": "Cave drip water acts as a signal carrier for the soil-rock-air system leading to the capture of climatic and environmental information in stalagmites. This paper seeks to develop an understanding of the environmental and climatic factors which control fluorescence variations in dripwater from in Heshang Cave, Central China. This information is essential to unravelling the significance of organic fluorescence in stalagmites and its utility in quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions. On the seasonal time scale, drip water fluorescence is largely controlled by the decomposition and translocation of dissolved organic matter in the soil, related to climate factors like temperature and precipitation. On the inter-annual time scale, longer duration monitoring data in scarce, yet this is needed to fully comprehend the influence of climate in stalagmite fluorescence time series. This study presents nine consecutive years of monthly drip water fluorescence intensity and drip rate data from two perennial drip sites in Heshang Cave. Drip water fluorescence was generally characterized by intensities in spring/summer and low intensities in autumn/winter. In dry hydrologic years, little seasonality in fluorescence signals was observed, but the opposite was observed in wet years. On the inter-annual time scale, the annual mean intensities of drip water fluorescence positively correlated with local annual rainfall with a 1-year lag (R2HS4=0.94; R2HS6=0.74). This indicates that rainfall is the main control on total drip water fluorescence (integrating across a hydrologic year), despite significant degrees of intra-annual fluorescence variation being observed between wet and dry years. These findings are of direct relevance for paleoclimate reconstruction using fluorescence intensities in stalagmites from the Asian monsoon region.\nKey words: fluorescence; dissolved organic matter; drip water rates; seasonality; precipitation",

            "abstract": "A regional air-sea coupled model coupled through OASIS3.0 was developed for CORDEX East Asia. The regional air-sea coupled model, named as FROALS, was composed of a regional climate model RegCM3 as its atmospheric component, a global climate ocean model (LICOM) as its oceanic component. The performance of regional atmospheric model over CORDEX EA was firstly optimized by tuning seven parameters, using the multiple very fast simulated annealing approach. The performance of FROALS in the simulation of Asian summer monsoon during 1989-2010 was assessed by using the metrics developed by the CLIVAR Asian–Australian Monsoon Panel (AAMP) Diagnostics Task Team. Results indicated that FROALS exhibited good performance in simulating the climatology of Asian summer monsoon. The simulated JJA mean SST biases were weaker than those in CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM). The skill of FROALS approached that of CMIP5 MMEM in terms of the annual cycle of Asian summer monsoon. The model also well captured the spatial pattern of the intraseasonal variability variance and extreme climate indices of Asian summer monsoon despite with larger amplitude.\nThen driven by the historical simulation and future climate projection from a global climate system model, dynamical downscaling has been conducted at the uniformly horizontal resolution of 50 km. The impacts of regional air-sea coupling on the simulation of East Asian summer monsoon rainfall have been investigated with comparisons to the corresponding standalone regional climate model (RCM) simulations. The added value of FROALS with respect to the driving global climate was evident in terms of both climatology and interannual variability of summer rainfall over eastern China, contributing from both the high horizontal resolution and the reasonably simulated moisture fluxes convergence. Compared with the standalone RCM simulation, the spatial pattern of the simulated low level monsoon flow over East Asian-western North Pacific was improved in the FROALS due to the inclusion of regional air-sea coupling. The impact of regional air-sea coupling in future climate change downscaling is investigated.",

The physical properties of rock such as composition, texture and structure have previously been difficult to accurately quantify through remote sensing, however, new research in the fields of terrestrial LiDAR and infrared thermography has proven useful in the differentiation of lithology in sedimentary outcrops. This study focuses on the application of these methods, in conjunction with digital photogrammetry, to a number of volcanic rock masses in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB) and Chilcotin Group (CG) of British Columbia. The GVB is a chain of volcanoes and related features extending through southwestern British Columbia and is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The CG is an assemblage of Neogene-aged lavas covering nearly 36,500 km2 in central British Columbia.\nWe integrate infrared chronothermography, which enables the characterization of temporal change in the thermal signature, laser waveform attributes such as amplitude and intensity, and digital photogrammetry, in order to distinguish between a range of rock types, lithologies and structures. This data is compared to laboratory experiments on field samples and ground-truth information collected by classical geological and geotechnical methods. Our research clearly shows that it is possible to remotely map, in 3D, otherwise inaccessible volcanic rock masses.",

            "abstract": "Exhumation rates >5 mm a-1 have been reported for Namche Barwa, making it one of the most rapidly exhuming places on earth. The driver of such high exhumation rates has been highly debated, and two principle hypotheses have evolved: first the aneurysm model (Zeitler et al., 2001) which proposes that a weakening of the crust coupled with extremely active surface processes causes a spatially stationary locus of exhumation. Secondly a northward plunging antiform that is progressively migrating north-eastward (Seward and Burg, 2008) may instead explain the concentration of extremely low cooling ages and rapid exhumation. Distinguishing the effects of tectonic and surface processes, as well as climate is complex, especially given that most existing thermochronometric systems are unable to resolve late-stage cooling histories. Here we present multi-OSL-thermochronometry which comprises a series of different systems with closure temperature ranging from 30 to 70 oC. We have applied this new technique to a suite of samples from the Namche Barwa massif and are able to resolve cooling histories over 0.1 Ma timescales. Our data indicate propagation of a knick-point along the Parlung river, which can be explained by progressive north-eastward migration of a northward plunging antiform. We suggest therefore that river incision does not feedback onto tectonics, as proposed by the aneurysm model.\n",

            "abstract": "The Budyko hypothesis provides a reference condition of water balance and describes an empirical relationship between precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E) and potential evapotranspiration (Ep). However, real-world catchments often deviate significantly from the theoretical Budyko curve. Recent advances of understanding in the impacts of seasonal water balances on long-term averaged water balance showed that phase difference between P and Ep is a major cause of downward departure from the Budyko curve. The phase difference and its processing by the catchments are in fact recorded over the globe in the form of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA). Here we present a GRACE-assisted Budyko-type formula that has improved predictive accuracy for long term E/P using the aridity index and storage patterns. We established an error model for the residual between Turk-Pike form of the Budyko curve and the observed E, based on a seamless United States basin water balance dataset. We found that the error model could improve the prediction efficiency by more than 60% comparing to Budyko model. The form of the error model was supported by Monte Carlo analysis. We compared the results with NLDAS predict E and found that the GRACE-corrected formula are in closer agreement with NLDAS than that without GRACE correction. In addition, we apply this error model to the whole world and global E was predicted. By comparing with other E products we found this error model can correct Budyko curve effectively.",

At regional scale ages decrease from central to western Nepal. Ages in central Nepal are < 5 Ma with many < 2 Ma, whereas ages west of the Kaligandaki are 5-14 Ma. The sand samples are dominated by 8-6 Ma detrital AFT age populations. Thermal modeling of AFT and ZHe ages in western Nepal shows an episode of rapid cooling between 12 and 8 Ma during emplacement of the Ramgarh thrust. Rocks from lower structural positions have younger (< 8 Ma) ages, consistent with growth of the Lesser Himalayan duplex. Old cooling ages in western Nepal correlate with lower erosion rates, drier climate, and an upward-convex to gently sloping topographic profile. Precipitation in western Nepal is concentrated at the front of the high-grade, GH klippen, which orographically shelter the thrust belt to the north. Younger ages in central Nepal instead correlate with higher erosion rates, northward penetration of intense monsoonal precipitation into the interior of the range, and development of an upward-concave topographic profile indicative of relatively intense erosion. This region lacks GH rocks south of the trace of the Main Central thrust, and the area between the Main Boundary and Main Frontal thrusts is lower than 1 km allowing precipitation to penetrate farther north. Higher erosion in central compared to western Nepal is also supported by the geology: resistant GH rocks in southern central Nepal are limited to the Kathmandu klippe, whereas in western Nepal they cover a larger area in the Dadeldhura and Jajarkot klippen. Cooling ages in western Nepal are interpreted to date the timing of thrust-sheet emplacement as supported by a southward decrease of ages. In central Nepal the correlation between intense precipitation and young cooling ages suggests transient climate-enhanced headward erosion and is supported by a northward decrease of ages. We suggest that in central Nepal the cooling signature related to emplacement of the Main Central and Ramgarh thrusts as well as growth of the Lesser Himalayan duplex has been removed by recent erosion.",

            "abstract": "The spatial and temporal extent of geological phenomena makes experiments in geology difficult to conduct, if not entirely impossible and collection of data is laborious and expensive – so expensive that most of the time we cannot test a hypothesis. The aim, in many cases, is to gather enough data to build a predictive geological model. Even in a mine, where data are abundant, a model remains incomplete because the information at the level of a blasting block is two orders of magnitude larger than the sample from a drill core, and we have to take measurement errors into account. So, what confidence can we have in a model based on sparse data, uncertainties and measurement error?\nSynthetic geology does not attempt to model the real world in terms of geological processes with all their uncertainties, rather it offers an artificial geological data source with fully known properties. On the basis of this artificial geology, we can simulate geological sampling by established or future technologies to study the resulting dataset. Conducting these experiments in silico removes the constraints of testing in the field or in production, and provides us with a known ground-truth against which the steps in a data analysis and integration workflow can be validated.\nReal-time simulation of data sources can be used to investigate crucial questions such as the potential information gain from future sensing capabilities, or from new sampling strategies, or the combination of both, and it enables us to test many \"what if?\" questions, both in geology and in data engineering. What would we be able to see if we could obtain data at higher resolution? How would real-time data analysis change sampling strategies? Does our data infrastructure handle many new real-time data streams? What feature engineering can be deducted for machine learning approaches? By providing a 'data sandbox' able to scale to realistic geological scenarios we hope to start answering some of these questions.",

            "abstract": "Poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs) are observed near the dayside poleward auroral oval boundary. PMAFs are thought to be an ionospheric signature of dayside reconnection and flux transfer events. PMAFs tend to occur when the IMF is southward. Although a limited number of PMAFs has been found in association with IMF southward turning, events without appreciable changes in IMF have also been reported. While those PMAFs could be triggered spontaneously, many of the past studies used solar wind measurements far away from the bow shock nose and may have used inaccurate time shift or missed small-scale structures in the solar wind. To examine how often PMAFs are triggered by upstream structures using solar wind measurements close to the bow shock nose, we use the AGO all sky imager in Antarctic and THEMIS B and C satellites in 2008, 2009 and 2011. We identified 24 conjunction events, where at least one of the THEMIS satellites is in the solar wind and the AGO imager is located within 3 MLT from the THEMIS MLT. We found that, in 14 out of 24 conjunction events, PMAFs occur soon after IMF southward turning, indicating that IMF southward turning could be the major triggering of PMAFs. Interestingly, among these 14 cases, there are 7 cases with different IMF structures between THEMIS B/C and OMNI, which obtained IMF information from WIND and ACE. And the larger correlation coefficients between PMAFs and IMFs observed by THMEIS B/C than OMNI present the advantages of THEMIS B/C. Among the 10 cases without correlating with IMF structures, PMAFs in two events are shown to have good correlation with reflected ions in the foreshock. Based on all the conjunction events we identified, IMF southward turning is the major trigger of PMAFs and reflected ions have minor effects. The rest of the cases could be spontaneous PMAFs, although foreshock activities, even if exists, may be missed due to the IMF orientation.",

            "abstract": "A regional multi-frequency-band lightning detection network in Beijing (BLNET) has been developed for both research and operational purposes. The network is employed in the experiment of Dynamic-microphysical-electrical Processes in Severe Thunderstorms and Lightning Hazards (Storm973), supported by Ministry of Science and Technology as National Key Basic Research Program of China or 973 Program. The network consisted of 16 stations in 2015 covering most part of The “Jing-Jin-Ji” (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) metropolis zone, one of the most developed areas in China. Four different sensors, including slow antenna, fast antenna, magnetic antenna, and VHF antenna, are integrated in each station to detect lightning radiation signals in different frequency band. The Chan algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt method are adopted jointly in the lightning location algorithm. In addition to locate the lightning radiation pulses in two-dimension or three-dimension in different band, the charge source neutralized by the lightning discharge can be retrieved either. The theoretical horizontal error over the network is less than 200 m and the vertical error is less than 500 m over the network. The comparison of total lightning location results with corresponding radar echoes for thunderstorm cases indicates the good performance of BLNET in the severe convection surveillance. The actual two-dimensional location error in VLF/LF band, compared with a ground truth that acquired with a GPS-synchronized high-speed video camera, is about 250 m.",

            "abstract": "Based on daily rainfall data from CMA, best track data of Tropical Cyclones (TC) from JMA, and the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis from NOAA, regional mean daily precipitation extreme (RDPE) events over Fujian-Jiangxi Region (FJR) of China and the associated circulation anomalies have been investigated. During summers of 1979-2011, totaling 105 RDPE events are identified; out of which 35 are TC-influenced (TCIn-RDPE) and 70 no-TC-related (TCFr-RDPE). Distinct differences between these two types of RDPEs are found in both their statistical features and the related circulation patterns, except they all occurred more frequently with stronger intensities in recent two decades other than in 1980s. TCFr-RDPEs usually occur in June while TCIn-RDPEs mainly do in July-August. When TCFr-RDPEs happen, a center of the departure cyclonic circulation is observed over FJR, with an anomalous anticyclonic circulation to the south of this region. The warm/moist airflows from the South-China-Sea (SCS) and western Pacific meet with colder air from the north to form a narrow convergent belt of water vapor over FJR. Simultaneously, positive diabatic forcing anomalies are observed over FJR whereas negatives over both its south and north sides, facilitating the formation and maintenance of the cyclonic circulation anomaly as well as the upward motion of the atmosphere over FJR. As TCIn-RDPEs occur, southeastern China is dominated by a TC-related stronger anomalous cyclonic circulation. An anomalous anticyclonic circulation in mid- and high-latitudes north of the FJR exist in mid and lower troposphere, which looks opposite as compared to that of TCFr-RDPE events. The abundant warm/wet air is carried into the FJR from both the Indian Ocean and SCS, leading to large amount of latent heat to release over FJR, inducing strong ascent of air there. Furthermore, large differences are also found in ways of Rossby wave energy propagation between these two type RDPE events. These results are helpful for us to deepen understanding of mechanisms behind these two types of RDPE events.",

            "abstract": "Induced polarization (IP) is a powerful tool in metalliferous ore exploration. However, there are many sources, such as clay and graphite, which can generate IP anomaly. Spectral induced polarization (SIP) measures IP response on a wide frequency range. This method provides a way to discriminate IP response generated by metalliferous ore or other objects. The best way to explore metalliferous ore is 3D SIP exploration. However, if we consider the exploration cost and efficiency, we can use SIP profiling to find an anomaly, and then use 2D/3D SIP sounding to characterize the anomaly. Based on above idea, we used a large-scale distributed SIP measurement system which can realize 800 sounding sites in one direction at the same time. This system can be used for SIP profiling, 2D/3D SIP sounding with high efficiency, high resolution, and large depth of investigation (> 1000 m). Qiushuwan copper - molybdenum deposit is located in Nanyang city, Henan province, China. It is only a middle-size deposit although over 100 holes were drilled and over 40 years of exploration were spent because of very complex geological setting. We made SIP measurement over 100 rock and ore samples to discriminate IP responses of ore and rock containing graphite. Then we carried out 7 lines of 2D SIP exploration with the depth of investigation great than 1000 m. The minimum electode spacing for potential difference is only 20 m. And we increase the spacing of current electodes at linear scale. This acquisition setting ensures high density data acquired and high quality data acquisition. Modeling and inversion result proves that we can get underground information with high resolution by our method. Our result shows that there exists a strong SIP response related to ore body in depth > 300 m. Pseudo-3D inversion of five 2D SIP sounding lines shows the location and size of IP anomaly. The new drillings based our result found a big copper-molybdenum ore body in new position with depth > 300 m and ore thickness > 300 m.",

            "abstract": "Marine aerosols, such as sea salt particles, and sulfate and organic particles originated from marine biotas, exist in the marine atmosphere. Additionally, continental aerosols, such as dust and anthropogenic substances are transported over the open oceans. Variation of number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) depends on the number-size distribution and chemical compositions of aerosols, and affects the lifetime and the reflectivity of clouds over the open oceans.\nDuring the R/V Hakuho Maru KH-12-1 cruise from Callao to Tokyo via Honolulu in the Pacific Ocean (23 January – 7 March 2012), aerosol number-size distribution and CCN number concentration were continuously measured, and the marine aerosols for chemical analysis were collected on shipboard.\nIn the marine atmosphere over the Pacific, averaged aerosol total number concentration (TN) was 280 cm-3. Bimodal number-size distributions were observed frequently with peaks at 40-60 nm (Aitken mode) and 160-230 nm (accumulation mode).\nCCN concentrations were categorized by assuming three types of particles by chemical compositions (i.e., NaCl; a major component of sea salt particles, (NH4)2SO4; a sulfur oxide originated from the marine biotas, and Oxalic acid; a major component among organic carbon (OC) originated from the marine biotas).\nActivation Rate (AR), which is defined as the ratio of the number concentrations of CCN against TN, varied mainly because of the number-size distribution. Chemical composition was the factor that determined AR values. However, the AR variations caused by changes of the chemical composition were much smaller than those caused changes of the particle size distribution even when Asian dust were observed over the region on 27-29 February. During the long range transport, rapid coagulation among mineral dust, organics and sea salt particles may accelerate the gravitational setting of marine aerosols and supplies the terrestrial substances to the ocean environment.",

            "abstract": "The Archean Wyoming Craton is a primary building block of the core of the North American continent. It resisted tectonic deformation for over a billion years, but during the Laramide orogeny significant crustal shortening was accommodated by basement-involved thrusting. Xenoliths suggest that ~50 km of cratonic mantle were removed from the Wyoming Province by basal erosion during this time. This orogenic event resulted in the formation of several mountain ranges in Wyoming which are part of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern limit of the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming is typically defined by the Big Horn and Laramie ranges. The Black Hills represent a topographic anomaly having a similar trend to the Big Horn and the Laramie Mts, but lying ~200 km NE of the Rocky Mountain Front (RMF); while the intervening region is relatively undeformed. Subduction of the conjugate to the Shatsky Rise is the leading hypothesis to explain the flattening of the Farallon slab that lead to the Laramide orogeny. The leading edge of the Shatsky conjugate would have been the conjugate to the Tamu Massif, the largest known single volcano on the planet. The reconstructed path of the Tamu conjugate plausibly places it beneath the region between the RMF and the Black Hills, where a high seismic velocity anomaly is observed by body wave tomography to depths exceeding 200 km. We propose that subcretion of the highly depleted mantle lithosphere of the Tamu cojugate re-cratonized a region of the Wyoming Province forming a distinct rigid block. We further suggest that the new block successfully resisted tectonic deformation and transferred the stresses of the Laramide orogeny northeastward to generate the basement-cored uplift of the Black Hills.",

            "abstract": "A moment tensor is a 3 x 3 symmetric matrix that expresses an earthquake source. We construct a parameterization of the five-dimensional space of all moment tensors of unit norm. The coordinates associated with the parameterization are closely related to moment tensor orientations and source types. The parameterization is uniform, in the sense that equal volumes in the coordinate domain of the parameterization correspond to equal volumes of moment tensors. Uniformly distributed points in the coordinate domain therefore give uniformly distributed moment tensors. A cartesian grid in the coordinate domain can be used to search efficiently over moment tensors. We find that uniformly distributed moment tensors have uniformly distributed orientations (eigenframes), but that their source types (eigenvalue triples) are distributed so as to favor double couples. An appropriate choice of a priori moment tensor probability is a prerequisite for parameter estimation. As a seemingly sensible choice, we consider the homogeneous probability, in which equal volumes of moment tensors are equally likely. We believe that it will lead to improved characterization of source processes.",

            "abstract": "The northern Cordilleran ice sheet (CIS) consisted of a series of quasi-independent ice lobes that coalesced during the last glacial maximum (LGM) to form a continuous carapace of precipitation limited ice over southern Yukon. Variations in effective precipitation to different source areas of these ice lobes have been used to explain disparities in glacier extents in marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 4 and 6. Deglaciation of the northern margin of the CIS and its rate of recession from the LGM are poorly understood. We use cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating (10Be and 36Cl) on groups of 3-4 glacial erratics to reconstruct the timing and rate of deglaciation. Our sampling concentrated on the St. Elias, Cassiar and Selwyn lobes, as well an independent glacier from the Ogilvie Mountains.\nBoulders sampled up-ice from terminal moraines show that the initiation of deglaciation varied regionally. 36Cl ages from the Ogilvie Mountains indicate that deglaciation initiated by 24.8 ka. Further south in the Selwyn Lobe, two sites separated by ~150 km returned ages of 15.2 and 16.1 ka. To the south-west, three boulders from the Cassiar Lobe are 13.6 ka.\nRates of deglaciation are best constrained for the Cassiar Lobe with two transects along different flow lines. Multiple valley bottom samples in the mid-deglaciation setting at Whitehorse yielded ages of 12.0 ka, while one boulder from the adjacent ridge top 600 m above is 13.5 ka. In the accumulation zone, ice-free conditions occurred by 10.8 ka. The other transect has higher elevation samples in a mid-deglaciation setting in the Pelly Mountains that indicate deglaciation occurred by 13.0 ka. Samples taken from high elevation and valley bottom sites close to accumulation zones of the Cassiar Lobe yielded ages of 13.6 and 11.0 ka, respectively.\nThese results provide a chronology for the style of deglaciation interpreted from regional mapping throughout Yukon: gradual initial retreat and thinning marked by moraines, followed by rapid downwasting and regional stagnation. Thinning of the ice to expose uplands in the Cassiar lobe was coincident with margin retreat. The increase in rates of deglaciation after 12 ka fits well with mapped evidence of regional stagnation. These ages correspond to evidence in the north Pacific of rapid warming immediately after the Younger Dryas in the pre-Boreal.",

            "abstract": "Salmon are a valuable cultural and economic resource throughout the Pacific Northwest, but increasing human activity is degrading coastal ecosystems and threatening local salmon populations. Salmon conservation efforts often focus on habitat restoration, including the re-colonization of salmon into historically obstructed areas such as the Cedar River in Washington, USA. However, to assess the implications of salmon re-colonization on a landscape scale, it is critical to consider not only the river ecosystem but also the surrounding riparian habitat. Although prior studies suggest that salmon alter riparian food web dynamics, the riparian community on the Cedar River has not yet been characterized. To investigate possible connections between salmon and the riparian habitat, we surveyed riparian spider communities along a gradient of salmon inputs (g/m2). In 10-m transects along the banks of the river, we identified spiders and spider webs, collected prey from webs, and characterized nearby aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. We found that the density of aquatic macroinvertebrates, as well as the density of spider prey, both had significant positive relationships with salmon inputs, supporting the hypothesis that salmon provide energy and nutrients for both aquatic and riparian food webs. We also found that spider diversity significantly decreased with salmon inputs, potentially due to confounding factors such as stream gradient or vegetation structure. Although additional information is needed to fully understand this relationship, the significant connection between salmon inputs and spider diversity is compelling motivation for further studies regarding the link between aquatic and riparian systems on the Cedar River. Understanding the connections between salmon and the riparian community is critical to characterizing the landscape-scale implications of sustainable salmon management in the Pacific Northwest.",

            "abstract": "Illitization, the transformation of smectite to illite, could compromise some beneficiary features of an engineered barrier system (EBS) that is composed primarily of bentonite and clay host rock. It is a major determining factor to establish the maximum design temperature of the repositories because it is believed that illitization could be greatly enhanced at temperatures higher than 100 oC and thus significantly lower the sorption and swelling capacity of bentonite and clay rock. However, existing experimental and modeling studies on the occurrence of illitization and related performance impacts are not conclusive, in part because the relevant couplings between the thermal, hydrological, chemical, and mechanical (THMC) processes have not been fully represented in the models. Here we present fully coupled THMC simulations of a generic nuclear waste repository in a clay formation with bentonite-backfilled EBS. Two scenarios were simulated for comparison: a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister can reach about 200 oC and a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister peaks at about 100 oC.\nThe model simulations demonstrate that illitization is in general more significant at higher temperatures. We also compared the chemical changes and the resulting swelling stress change for two types of bentonite: Kunigel-VI and FEBEX bentonite. Higher temperatures also lead to much higher stress in the near field, caused by thermal pressurization and vapor pressure buildup in the EBS bentonite and clay host rock. Chemical changes lead to a reduction in swelling stress, which is more pronounced for Kunigel-VI bentonite than for FEBEX bentonite.",

            "abstract": "We present results of a petrographic study of Harrat Rahat volcanic field in western Saudi Arabia as part of a collaborative project between the U.S.G.S. and the Saudi Geological Survey. Lavas range in composition from alkali basalt to trachyphonolite. Basalts have <2-10 vol.% phenocrysts of euhedral olivine and plagioclase (± minor clinopyroxene). In intermediate lavas, phenocrysts (<5 vol.%) of olivine and plagioclase are resorbed, and plagioclase also exhibits sieve textures and strong zoning, indicative of complex magmatic histories. Trachyphonolite lavas have 0-35 vol.% large phenocrysts of anorthoclase and trace fayalitic olivine but are characterized by a size distribution of crystals that is seriate in hand specimen, so that most exceeded 45% crystals at the time of eruption. Some contain groundmass alkali amphibole. Crystal size distributions (CSD) of crystal-rich trachyphonolites produce simple linear trends (see below), which are interpreted as signifying that all the crystals are related through a common nucleation and growth history, at more or less constant pressure. Linear CSDs indicate no loss of small crystals due to reheating of magmas by recharge, no gain of small crystals due to late-stage nucleation on ascent or degassing, and no addition of large phenocrysts by crystal accumulation or magma mixing. Experimental studies demonstrate that silica-undersaturated evolved magmas like those erupted at Harrat Rahat can form by fractionation of alkali basalts at crustal depths greater than ~25 km. The observed phenocryst assemblage in the trachyphonolites, however, forms at shallow depths, ~2-4 km, according to MELTS modeling. Coupled with CSD data, this suggests that deep extraction events yield crystal-poor trachyphonolite magmas that rise to the upper crust where they undergo crystallization. Extensive shallow crystallization of trachyphonolites may have triggered eruptions by causing vapor saturation, which lowers magma density via vesiculation and has the potential to explosively disrupt wallrocks. Based on the complex crystal textures in the intermediate lavas and their similarity in age to the trachyphonolites, ~120 ka, we suggest that most of the intermediate magmas form by magma mixing when rising basalts intercept and entrain shallow trachyphonolite magma.",

            "abstract": "The termination of seismicity at the bottom of the upper continental\ncrust is usually attributed to the onset of plasticity in quartz at\ntemperature of about 300 deg. C, and a transition from the\nvelocity-weakening to velocity-strengthening behavior of typical\ncrustal rocks such as granite. Laboratory measurements of the rate\nparameter (a-b) of rate-state friction using a triaxial apparatus show\na transition from negative (a-b) (velocity-weakening behavior,\nconditionally unstable slip) to positive (a-b) (velocity-strengthening\nbehavior, stable creep) for Westerly granite at temperatures above\n300-350 deg. C (Stesky, 1978; Blanpied et al., 1991). Assuming a\nreasonable geotherm, this transition is expected to occur at depth of\n12-15 km, in good agreement with the depth distribution of earthquakes\nin California. The temperature dependence of the (a-b) parameter is\nbelieved to control the thickness of the seismogenic layer, as\nearthquakes would not be able to nucleate under velocity-strengthening\nconditions. However, Mitchell et al. (2013) reported\nvelocity-weakening behavior of Westerly granite at temperatures up to\n450 deg. C in laboratory tests using a heated direct shear apparatus\nand solid samples. Here we present results from recent experiments\ndone on thick gouge at both dry and hydrated conditions at\ntemperatures up to 600 deg. C and normal stresses up to 40 MPa. We\nfind that the rate dependence parameter (a-b) progressively decreases\nwith temperature over the entire temperature range, leading to more\nunstable slip at higher temperature. This tendency is enhanced in the\npresence of water. The new experimental data suggest that friction of\ncommon crustal rocks can be velocity-weakening over a wider depth\nrange than previously believed, in particular under dry conditions or\nlow water fugacity. This may help explain deep crustal seismicity in\nareas of active extension (e.g., Baikal and East Africa\\cite rift\nzones) and convergence (e.g., Himalayas and Andes), as well as\nnon-volcanic tremor associated with deep roots of active faults (e.g.,\nSan Andreas fault in central California).",

            "abstract": "Moisture in the upper most layer of soil column from 14 different models under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 (CMIP5) project were analyzed for four seasons of the year. Aim of this study was to explore variability in soil moisture over south Asia using multi model ensemble and relationship between summer rainfall and soil moisture for spring and summer season. GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) dataset set was used for comparing CMIP5 ensemble mean soil moisture in different season. Ensemble mean represents soil moisture well in accordance with the geographical features; prominent arid regions are indicated profoundly. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was applied to study the variability. First component of EOF explains 17%, 16%, 11% and 11% variability for spring, summer, autumn and winter season respectively. Analysis reveal increasing trend in soil moisture over most parts of Afghanistan, Central and north western parts of Pakistan, northern India and eastern to south eastern parts of China, in spring season. During summer, south western part of India exhibits highest negative trend while rest of the study area show minute trend (increasing or decreasing). In autumn, south west of India is under highest negative loadings. During winter season, north western parts of study area show decreasing trend. Summer rainfall has very week (negative or positive) spatial correlation, with spring soil moisture, while possess higher correlation with summer soil moisture.\nOur studies have significant contribution to understand complex nature of land - atmosphere interactions, as soil moisture prediction plays an important role in the cycle of sink and source of many air pollutants. Next level of research should be on filling the gaps between accurately measuring the soil moisture using satellite remote sensing and land surface modelling. Impact of soil moisture in tracking down different types of pollutant will also be studied.",

            "abstract": "The D’’ layer beneath the western Pacific is characterized by obvious lateral heterogeneity in seismic velocity structure, variable seismic discontinuity at its top and existence of ultra-low velocity zones above core mantle boundary. Details on the geometry and strength of anisotropy, especially those near the edge of LLSVP (large low shear velocity provinces) in the D’’ layer are still debated. The SKS and SKKS phases, for the same event-station pair, sample the similar raypath in the shallow mantle but different raypath in the lowermost mantle. The splitting data of the SKS and SKKS pairs thus can be used to constrain seismic anisotropy at the lowermost mantle. In this study, we use the SKS splitting data from different earthquakes to estimate the anisotropy beneath a seismic station, and then use them to extract D’’ seismic anisotropy from SKKS splitting data. We collected 1700 SKS and 456 SKKS high-quality waveforms for 45 earthquakes from Toga recorded at distances between 85° - 120° by the seismic networks of the China Earthquake Administration (CEA). Most of the SKS-SKKS pairs show similar splitting. However, large differences are observed from pairs that sample the edge of LLSVP, suggesting the presence of seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle. The fast polarization direction estimated from the SKKS data after correction of shallow anisotropy is roughly perpendicular to the edge of LLSVP. The observation of significant lowermost mantle anisotropy from the edge of LLSVP beneath western Pacific would shed lights on the nature of LLSVP.",

            "abstract": "Severe natural phenomena such as hurricane, volcano, blizzard, flood and drought have the potential to cause immeasurable property damages, great socioeconomic impact, and tragic loss of human life. From searching to assessing the “Big”, i.e., massive and heterogeneous scientific data (particularly, satellite and model products) in order to investigate those natural hazards, it has, however, become a daunting task for Earth scientists and applications researchers, especially during recent decades.\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Service Center (GES DISC) has served “Big” Earth science data, and the pertinent valuable information and services to the aforementioned users of diverse communities for years. In order to help and guide our users to online readily (i.e., with a minimum effort) acquire their requested data from our enormous resource at GES DISC for studying their targeted hazard/event, we have thus initiated a “Bundle Data” approach in 2014, first targeting the hurricane event/topic. We have recently worked on new topics such as volcano and blizzard. The “bundle data” of a specific hazard/event is basically a sophisticated integrated data package consisting of a series of proper datasets containing a group of relevant (“knowledge-based”) data variables readily accessible to users via a system-prearranged table linking those data variables to the proper datasets (URLs). This online approach has been developed by utilizing a few existing data services such as Mirador as search engine; Giovanni for visualization; and OPeNDAP for data access, etc. The online “Data Cookbook” site at GES DISC is the current host for the “bundle data”. We are now also planning on developing an “Automated Virtual Collection Framework” that shall eventually accommodate the “bundle data”, as well as further improve our management in “Big Data”.",

            "abstract": "Elves are the optical signature of the lightning electromagnetic pulse (EMP) interaction with the lower ionosphere. Simultaneously, the lightning EMP induces collisional heating of the lower ionosphere and deposits energy in the D-region. We use a database of elve observations from the ground-based PIPER photometer instrument, together with VLF/LF observations of the causative sferics, to assess the probability of elve production for different lightning source parameters. We find that the lightning peak current alone predicts the occurrence of elves with 90% accuracy, and there is a 50% probability of elve production for peak currents of 88 kA. Using the resulting probability regression curve together with one year of global lightning peak current data from GLD360, we estimate that 0.8% of all lightning across the globe produces elves, for a total of ~5 x 106 elves per year globally. \nNext, using the Stanford EMP model, we calculate the total energy deposited in the lower ionosphere due to lightning, as a function of peak current and other source parameters. Again, we find that the lightning peak current provides the majority of the variation and is a good predictor of the total heating in the ionosphere. We find that the energy deposited in the lower ionosphere is 70-80% of the total radiated energy in the EMP, the variation depending on day vs. night and only weakly dependent on peak current. Integrating over the total annual lightning activity, we find a total of ~60 TJ of energy deposited in the lower ionosphere per year due to lightning.",

            "abstract": "Alaska is one of the world's most seismically and tectonically active regions. Its enhanced seismicity, including slab seismicity down to 180 km, provides opportunities (1) to characterize pervasive crustal faulting and slab deformation through the estimation of moment tensors and (2) to image subsurface structures to help understand the tectonic evolution of Alaska. Most previous studies of earthquakes and seismic imaging in Alaska have emphasized earthquake locations and body-wave travel-time tomography. In the past decade, catalogs of seismic moment tensors have been established, while seismic surface waves, active-source data, and potential field data have been used to improve models of seismic structure. We have developed moment tensor catalogs in the regions of two of the largest sedimentary basins in Alaska: Cook Inlet forearc basin, west of Anchorage, and Nenana basin, west of Fairbanks. Our moment tensor solutions near Nenana basin suggest a transtensional tectonic setting, with the basin developing in a stepover of a left-lateral strike-slip fault system. We explore the effects of seismic wave propagation from point-source and finite-source earthquake models by performing three-dimensional wavefield simulations using seismic velocity models that include major sedimentary basins. We will use our catalog of moment tensors within an adjoint-based, iterative inversion to improve the three-dimensional tomographic model of Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Earth's lithospheric structure exhibits variations in geometry---such as surface topography, Moho topography, discontinuities across faults, and subducting slabs---as well as variations in elastic properties---such as differences in composition between a sedimentary basin and an exhumed batholith. Three-dimensional models of Earth's structure need to account for these known geometric and volumetric variations. The Moho is a globally identifiable discontinuity between the lower crust and uppermost mantle. We review recent efforts on (1) constructing the Moho surface from existing data sets, (2) forward-modeling the local and teleseismic wavefield and its interactions with the Moho, and (3) prospects for simultaneously iteratively improving the Moho surface and surrounding crust and mantle velocity models, by using adjoint-based imaging techniques. Estimating the Moho is particularly challenging in regions spanning oceanic and continental crust such as southern California or Alaska, where the Moho depth varies from 10 km to 50 km (below sea level). The Moho surfaces in southern California and Alaska have been estimated from receiver functions, gravity data, and wide-angle active-source data (PmP and Pn). The influence of the Moho surface on the regional seismic wavefield can be quantified with 3D wavefield simulations using local earthquakes, with slab earthquake (if present) enhancing coverage. Recent efforts have combined frequency-wavenumber methods for teleseismic body wave propagation with 3D wavefield simulation methods for near-station body wave propagation and reverberations within the crust. These hybrid methods allow us to model crustal interactions with teleseismic body waves. Using a 2D synthetic problem we demonstrate how the Moho topography can be treated as unknown parameters within the same simulation-based framework that is used to iteratively improve tomographic models of the crust and upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Motivating people in rapidly urbanizing areas to take protective actions against natural disasters faces the challenge that these people often do not know what actions to take, do not believe that such actions are effective, and/or believe that the disaster will not happen to them within their lifetimes. Thus, finding demonstrated ways of motivating people to take protective action likely constitutes a grand challenge for natural disaster risk reduction and resiliency, because it may be one of the largest, lowest-cost sources of potential risk reduction in these situations. We developed a theory-based documentary film (hereafter, intervention) targeted at motivating retrofits of local school buildings, and tested its effectiveness in Kathmandu, Nepal, using a matched-pair clustered randomized controlled trial. The intervention features Nepalese who have strengthened their school buildings as role models to others at schools still in need of seismic work. It was tested at 16 Kathmandu Valley schools from November 2014 through March 2015. Schools were matched into 8 pairs, then randomly assigned to see either the intervention film or an attention placebo control film on an unrelated topic. Testing was completed just five weeks before the M 7.8 Gorkha earthquake struck central Nepal. When compared to the control schools, the schools whose community members saw the retrofit intervention film increased their knowledge of specific actions to take in support of earthquake-resistant construction, belief in the feasibility of making buildings earthquake-resistant, willingness to support seismic strengthening of the local school building, and likelihood to recommend to others that they build earthquake-resistant homes, which have all been shown to be precursors to taking self-protective action. This suggests that employing a mass-media intervention featuring community members who have already taken the desired action increases factors that may accelerate adoption of risk reduction actions by others who are similar to them.",

            "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a trace element that occurs at ppb level in most terrestrial materials. The determination of Cd in geological samples by ICP-MS is subject to Zr and/or Mo based oxide/hydroxide interference. This study developed a valid method for the determination of Cd by Ar aerosol dilution ICP-MS with inverse aqua regia extraction (in a water bath at 95℃ for 2h). An Agilent 7700x ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies, USA) with an aerosol dilution system was used. The extraction procedure separated most of the Zr matrix (>90%) from the analyte, and the residual Zr- hydroxides and Mo-oxides or hydroxides were successfully eliminated by adding an amount of Ar to the sample aerosol prior to the plasma. Compared to the conventional operation, the amounts of oxide and hydroxide ions formed in the plasma were reduced by up to 10 times. The relative yields of the interfering oxides and hydroxides were as low as 0.012% ((94Mo16OH++95Mo16O+)/(94Mo++95Mo+)) and 0.007% (94Zr16OH+/94Zr+). Under the optimized dilution gas flow rate (0.85 L min-1) and carrier gas flow rate (0.24 L min-1), the limit of detection (LOD, 3s) for 111Cd was 1.3 ng g-1. The accuracy of the method was assessed by using two USGS SRMs (andesite AGV-2 and basalt BCR-2). The Cd contents determined for AGV-2 and BCR-2 are 0.058±0.004μg g-1 and 0.148±0.007μg g-1 (N=10), which are in good agreement with the USGS reference values (0.061μg g-1 and 0.14μg g-1). The proposed method was also applied to determine Cd contents in 65 IGGE SRMs (28 soils, 28 sediments and 9 rocks). The measured Cd levels in these samples agree well with their certified values. The developed method shows great potential for the direct determination of trace levels of Cd in geological samples.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic sulfide ore bodies contain large amounts of sulfide with high concentrations of metals such as Ni, Cu and PGE. Their presence in relatively small intrusions commonly is attributed to the segregation and accumulation of sulfide droplets from magmas that flow rapidly through conduits. This 'high-flux' model is at odds with the following observations. Many ores appear to have been emplaced as magmatic breccias (Norilsk-Talnakh, Aguablanca) or crystal mushes (Jinchuan) containing a high proportion of sulfide. Such mixtures are very dense and could not have risen up through the crust from a deeper staging chamber. At Uitkomst and Platreef, screens of sedimentary rock maintaining the same orientation as adjacent sedimentary strata separate layers of ultramafic cumulates, some containing abundant sulfide ore. This geometry suggests that ultramafic mush and ore sulfides oozed into the sedimentary sequence, replacing less resistant strata. A mechanism explaining these observations is as follows: mafic-ultramafic intrusions both large and small do not differentiate in place but grow through the injection of magmas of differing compositions and crystallinity. Highly mafic magmas, particularly those charged with ferromagnesian crystals and sulfide, have high densities and they are injected into the lower parts of growing intrusions while less-dense, more evolved and/or plagioclase-rich magmas are injected at higher levels. Accumulation of sulfides probably occurs higher in the magma conduits and sulfide-rich mushes migrate or slump downwards in the conduit to form the ore bodies.",

Looking at past events and the current forecasts, which indicate Pacific Ocean conditions could lead to one of the strongest El Niño events on record this winter, it is no wonder that many water management agencies and their customers are expecting a relief in the southwestern United States (US) drought intensity as the probability of a strong El Niño becomes more significant. Despite the conditions in the Pacific Ocean, a strong El Niño is not a guarantee for wet conditions in the Colorado River basin - as can be seen from the 2002 event in which basin conditions were one of the driest on record. There is a great need to understand the range of possible conditions that could be observed under an El Niño event to better inform southwestern US water management agencies so that they may make well-guided decisions regarding their most valuable resource - the Colorado River.\nThis study builds upon past research based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climatology and hydrology projections and the analysis performed with singular variable decomposition (SVD) to identify climate models with high correlation between historical climate/hydrology in the CRB and sea surface temperature conditions in the Pacific Ocean. Past research methods were able to identify climate models which performed well using the SVD methodology. This current project seeks to analyze the well-performing climate models and identify future El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean and the resultant precipitation and temperature impacts in the lower CRB. This analysis will provide an objective, ensemble based outlook for potential climate change impacts under El Niño events.\nThe results of the study can potentially assist lower CRB water management agencies in characterizing the range of future El Niño impacts, under climate change conditions. It is expected that this information could be beneficial in understanding the range of potential El Niño impacts and their effect on drought in the southwestern US.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms have populated the Earth for billions of years and their activities are important biologic forces shaping our planetary environments. Microbial biomineralization that selectively take up environmental elements (e.g., C, S, P, Fe) and synthesize minerals either intracellularly or extracellularly is of great interest. One of the most interesting examples of these types of organisms are magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a polyphyletic group of prokaryotes that uptake iron from aquatic habitats and biomineralize intracellular nano-sized iron minerals of magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4), known as magnetosomes, and orientate and swim along the Earth’s magnetic field. However, our knowledge on the biomineralization mechanisms of MTB and their environmental function remains very limited because the genomic information of most MTB is still not fully understood. By using metagenomic approaches, we have acquired genomic sequences of environmental MTB communities and discovered several conserved genomic fragments containing gene operons for magnetite or greigite biomineralization from Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae MTB. The comparison of these gene clusters has provided valuable insights into the origin and evolution of magnetosome biomineralization. We further obtained several draft genomes of uncultivated MTB belonging to the phylum Nitrospirae, which reveals a metabolic flexibility of this poorly understood magnetotactic group and indicates their considerable roles in the biogeochemical cycles of iron and sulfur.",

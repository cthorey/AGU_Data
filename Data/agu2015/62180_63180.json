            "abstract": "In 2011, a perennial storage of water in the firn was observed in southeastern Greenland. An aquifer is created by surface melt water percolating down through the firn and saturating the pore space above the firn-ice transition. The mean depth to the top of the aquifer is 15 m and where it has been measured is 25 m thick. This water remains in the liquid state throughout the entire year and is stored within the aquifer. The firn aquifer contribution to sea level rise remains unclear. The aquifer could supply water to the glacier bed, accelerating glacial flow in the region. The aquifer could also store water until a saturation point is reached, and if the water is released at once, it could supply large amounts of fresh water to the ocean. To quantify the amount of liquid water stored in the firn, we used refraction seismic profiles to probe the base of the aquifer in 3 separate locations on the southeastern Greenland ice sheet. Finding the total thickness of the aquifer allows us to calculate the volume of water stored in the firn over these 100-500 meter long refraction lines. Our refraction seismic approach is sensitive to the thickness of the firn aquifer and total water content stored in the pore space of the firn. We combine our seismic measurements with densities and porosity data taken from firn cores extracted in the same area, as well as magnetic resonance soundings, and ground penetrating radar profiles to further constrain the structure of the aquifer. Elucidating the volume of water stored within these recently discovered aquifers is vital for determining the hydrological structure and stability of the southeastern Greenland ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "The Finite-Elements Tree-Crown Hydrodynamics model version 2 (FETCH2) simulates water flow through the tree using the porous media analogy. Empirical equations relate water potential within the stem to stomatal conductance at the leaf level. Leaves are connected to the stem at each height. While still simplified, this approach brings realism to the simulation of transpiration compared with models where stomatal conductance is directly linked to soil moisture. The FETCH2 model accounts for plant hydraulic traits such as xylem conductivity, area of hydro-active xylem, vertical distribution of leaf area, and maximal and minimal xylem water content, and their effect on the dynamics of water flow in the tree system. Such a modeling tool enhances our understanding of the role of hydraulic limitations and allows us to incorporate the effects of short-term water stresses on transpiration.\nHere, we use FETCH2 parameterized and evaluated with a large sap-flow observations data set, collected from 21 trees of two genera (oak/pine) at Silas Little Experimental Forest, NJ. The well-drained deep sandy soil leads to water stress during many days throughout the growing season. We conduct a set of tree-level transpiration simulations, and use the results to evaluate the effects of different hydraulic strategies on daily transpiration and water use efficiency. We define these \"hydraulic strategies\" through combinations of multiple sets of parameters in the model that describe the root, stem and leaf hydraulics.\nAfter evaluating the performance of the model, we use the results to shed light on the future trajectory of the forest in terms of species-specific transpiration responses. Application of the model on the two co-occurring oak species (Quercus prinus L. and Quercus velutina Lam) shows that the applied modeling approach was successfully captures the differences in water-use strategy through optimizing multiple physiological and hydraulic parameters.",

            "abstract": "Koshelev is the southernmost volcano of the Kamchatkan volcanic front where magmatic plumbing systems of the Kamchatkan subduction zone cross a thick layer of the oil-gas-bearing Neogene sedimentary strata of Western Kamchatka. The volcanic massive hosts a powerful hydrothermal system, which has been drilled in early 1980s. Deep wells tapped a hot (ca. 300ºC) saline solution (up to 40 g/L of Cl), whereas the upper part of the system is a typical steam cap with temperature close to 240ºC. Two hydrothermal fields of the volcano (Upper and Lower) discharge saturated or super-heated (up to 150ºC) steam and are characterized by numerous hot pools and low flow-rate springs of steam-heated waters enriched in boron and ammonia. There is also a small lateral group of warm Na-Ca-Cl-SO4 springs (40ºC). We report here our data and review the literature geochemical data on the chemical and isotopic composition of waters and hydrothermal vapours of the Koshelev system. Data on the gas composition include He and C isotopes, as well as the chemical and isotopic composition of light hydrocarbons. Water geochemistry includes literature data on water isotopes of the deep brine and trace elements and REE of steam-heated waters. A conceptual model of the system is presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "In the earliest Miocene the Antarctic ice sheet retreated substantially following the Mi-1 glaciation event. The relationship between pCO2 and orbital scale climate variations at this time is poorly understood, due to the paucity of pCO2 reconstructions with sufficient temporal resolution. Here, we report a pCO2 reconstruction based on fossil leaf micromorphological properties and supported by δ13C measurements, that indicates that pCO2 increased following the Mi-1 event and remained elevated for approximately 24 kyrs. The fossil leaves analyzed (Lauraceae) and δ13C measurements come from a drill core of annually laminated sediments recovered from a maar lake deposit in southern New Zealand spanning ~100 kyr across the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. The lake had a large and stable anoxic zone, allowing for remarkable preservation of organic material, including exquisitely preserved fossil leaves. The leaf stomatal/epidermal cell ratio (stomatal index) decreased for ~24 kyr during this time period, suggesting increased pCO2. δ13C values of primarily terrestrially sourced lake organic matter decreased by ~4‰ across the same interval, providing further support for an abrupt 24kyr-long increase in pCO2 at this time. By comparison with stomatal conductance and pCO2-induced carbon isotope fractionation in modern land plants, we estimate that the magnitude of the pCO2 increase was between 140 and 220 ppm. These results imply that dynamic variations in pCO2 occurred at precessional timescales during the early Miocene. We are further constraining the magnitude of pCO2 change and quantifying the pCO2 levels by: 1) Analyzing micromorphology and δ13C of close ecological and taxonomical modern analogues to early Miocene New Zealand Lauraceae, to better quantify changes in gas conductance and carbon isotope fractionation in response to recent pCO2 changes; 2) Directly measuring δ13C values and stomatal geometry of fossil leaves, to quantify pCO2 values using a recently published model based on fundamental leaf conductance principles.",

            "abstract": "Most previous studies of the Tibetan Plateau have focused on the processes of crustal thickening and subsequent lateral extrusion to account for the outward growth of the plateau. However, lithospheric structure across the tectonic boundaries of the Tibetan Plateau has not yet been fully imaged and, therefore, how geological structures evolved in association with the lateral expansion of the northeastern margin in particular remains unclear. Here, together with interpretation of regional geological and geophysical data, we employ a recently acquired 165 km-long deep seismic reflection image that crosses the Liupan shan (Fig. 1) northeastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau to show that crustal shortening, structural integrity, and topographic relief are strongly correlated. The resulting stratigraphic “architecture” suggests that crustal shortening is a primary driver for plateau uplift and expansion of northeastern Tibet and decoupled crustal deformation owing to differential structural integrity is accommodated during the subsequent northeastward growth of the plateau.\nFigure 1.Showing the seismic reflection line location and the topographic relief of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and the western Ordos basin (KF: Kunlun Fault; LP Shan: Liupan Shan; HF: Haiyuan Fault; YTSF: Yangtongshan Fault; NSS-LSF: Niushou Shan-Luoshan Fault)XG Shan: Xiaoguan Shan; YJD: Yanjiadian Diorite; GS: Guanshan Shan; CCP: Caochuanpu; LS Complex: Longshan Complex)",

            "abstract": "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data are widely used for the hydrological studies for large scale basins (≥100,000 sq km). GRACE data (Stokes Coefficients or Equivalent Water Height) used for hydrological studies are not direct observations but result from high level processing of raw data from the GRACE mission. Different partner agencies like CSR, GFZ and JPL implement their own methodology and their processing methods are independent from each other. The primary source of errors in GRACE data are due to measurement and modeling errors and the processing strategy of these agencies. Because of different processing methods, the final data from all the partner agencies are inconsistent with each other at some epoch. GRACE data provide spatio-temporal variations in Earth’s gravity which is mainly attributed to the seasonal fluctuations in water level on Earth surfaces and subsurface. During the quantification of error/uncertainties, several high positive and negative peaks were observed which do not correspond to any hydrological processes but may emanate from a combination of primary error sources, or some other geophysical processes (e.g. Earthquakes, landslide, etc.) resulting in redistribution of earth’s mass. Such peaks can be considered as outliers for hydrological studies. In this work, an algorithm has been designed to extract outliers from the GRACE data for Indo-Gangetic plain, which considers the seasonal variations and the trend in data. Different outlier detection methods have been used such as Z-score, modified Z-score and adjusted boxplot. For verification, assimilated hydrological (GLDAS) and hydro-meteorological data are used as the reference. The results have shown that the consistency amongst all data sets improved significantly after the removal of outliers.",

            "abstract": "The design of non-point sources control facilities in Korea is divided largely by the stormwater capture ratio, the stormwater load capture ratio, and the pollutant reduction efficiency of the facility. The stormwater capture ratio is given by a design formula as a function of the water quality treatment capacity, the greater the capacity, the more the amount of stormwater intercepted by the facility. The stormwater load capture ratio is defined as the ratio of the load entering the facility of the total pollutant load generated in the target catchment, and is given as a design formula represented by a function of the stormwater capture ratio.\nIn order to estimate the stormwater capture ratio and load capture ratio, a lot of quantitative analysis of hydrologic processes acted in pollutant emission is required, but these formulas have been applied without any verification. Since systematic monitoring programs were insufficient, verification of these formulas was fundamentally impossible. However, recently the Korean ministry of Environment has conducted an long-term systematic monitoring project, and thus the verification of the formulas became possible.\nIn this presentation, the stormwater capture ratio and load capture ratio are re-estimated using actual TP data obtained from long-term monitoring program at Noksan industrial complex located in Busan, Korea. Through the re-estimated process, the uncertainty included in the design process that has been applied until now will be shown in a quantitative extent. In addition, each uncertainty included in the stormwater capture ratio estimation and in the stormwater load capture ratio estimation will be expressed to quantify the relative impact on the overall non-point pollutant control facilities design process. Finally, the SWMM-Matlab interlocking module for model parameters estimation will be introduced.\nAcknowledgement\nThis subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment as \"The Eco Innovation Project : Non-point source pollution control research group“",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is the strongest contributor to sunlight absorption among atmospheric aerosols. Quantitative understanding of wet deposition of BC, which strongly affects the spatial distribution of BC, is important to improve our understandings on climate change. We have devised a technique for measuring the masses of individual BC particles in rainwater and snow samples, as a combination of a nebulizer and a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) (Ohata et al. 2011, 2013; Schwarz et al. 2012; Mori et al. 2014). We show two important improvements in this technique: 1)We have extended the upper limit of detectable BC particle diameter from 0.9 μm to about 4.0 μm by modifying the photodetector for measuring the laser-induced incandescence signal. 2)We introduced a pneumatic nebulizer Marin-5 (Cetac Technologies Inc., Omaha, NE, USA) and experimentally confirmed its high extraction efficiency (~50%) independent of particle diameter up to 2.0 μm. Using our improved system, we simultaneously measured the size distribution of BC particles in air and rainwater in Tokyo. We observed that the size distribution of BC in rainwater was larger than that in air, indicating that large BC particles were effectively removed by precipitation. We also observed BC particles with diameters larger than 1.0 μm, indicating that further studies of wet deposition of BC will require the use of the modified SP2.",

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the rich and growing set of constraints from geological reconstructions, geodetic data, and crustal and upper mantle heterogeneity imaged by structural seismology. We proceed to discuss a conceptual and quantitative framework for the causes of surface deformations. Exploring existing and newly developed tectonic and numerical geodynamic models, we illustrate the role of mantle convection on surface geology. A coherent picture emerges which can be outlined by two, almost symmetric, upper mantle convection cells. The down-wellings are found in the centre of the Mediterranean, and are associated with the descent of the Tyrrhenian and the Hellenic slabs. During plate convergence, these slabs migrated, driving return flow of the asthenosphere from the backarc regions. These currents can be found at large distance from the subduction zones, and are at present expressed in two upwellings beneath Anatolia and eastern Iberia. This convection system provides an explanation for the general pattern of seismic anisotropy in the Mediterranean, the first-order Anatolia and Adria microplate kinematics, and the positive dynamic topography of Anatolia and Eastern Iberia. More generally, it is an illustration of upper mantle, small-scale convection leading to intraplate deformation and complex plate boundary reconfiguration at the westernmost terminus of the Tethyan collision.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural production is a major contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and associated global warming. In this regard, novel carbon sequestration strategies such as large-scale biochar application may provide sustainable pathways to increase the terrestrial storage of carbon in agricultural areas. Biochar has a long residence time in the soil and hence understanding the soil properties affected by biochar addition needs to be investigated to identify the tradeoffs and synergies of large-scale biochar application. Even though several studies have investigated the impacts of biochar application on a variety of soil properties, very few studies have investigated the impacts on soil erosion, in particular wind (aeolian) erosion and subsequent particulate emissions. Using a combination of wind tunnel studies and laboratory experiments, we investigated the dust emission potential of biochar-amended agricultural soils. We amended biochar (unsieved or sieved to appropriate particle size; application rates ranging from 1 - 5 % of the soil by weight) to three soil types (sand, sandy loam, and silt loam) and estimated the changes in threshold shear velocity for wind erosion and dust emission potential in comparison to control soils. Our experiments demonstrate that emissions of fine biochar particles may result from two mechanisms (a) very fine biochar particles (suspension size) that are entrained into the air stream when the wind velocity exceeds the threshold, and (b) production of fine biochar particles originating from the abrasion by quartz grains. The results indicate that biochar application significantly increased particulate emissions and more interestingly, the rate of increase was found to be higher in the intermediate range of biochar application. As fine biochar particles effectively adsorb/trap contaminants and pathogens from the soil, the preferential erosion of fine biochar particles by wind may lead to concentration of contaminants in the airborne dust. The contaminants on biochar particles are mostly bioavailable, meaning that the contaminants can be desorbed and released to the biological system if inhaled. Hence the biochar-loaded dust from some agricultural areas may be a health hazard.",

New zircon LA–ICP–MS U–Pb data indicate that the early- and late-stage southern Quli, Qiligou, and Gaomiao porphyritic quartz diorites, the Canfang granodiorite, and the northern Wangmao porphyritic quartz monzodiorite were emplaced during the Early Cretaceous (~130 Ma) and the late Early Cretaceous (116 Ma). These rocks are characterized by high Na2O/K2O, Sr/Y, and (La/Yb)n ratios as well as high Sr concentrations, low Mg# values, and low heavy rare earth element and Y concentrations, all of which indicate an LMAR affinity. The samples have relatively high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7054–0.7095), and low eNd(t) (–11.90 to –22.20) and eHf(t) (–16.7 to –32.7) values, indicative of a lower continental crust origin. The presence of Neoproterozoic (754–542 Ma) and inherited Late Triassic (220 Ma) metamorphic zircons within the late Early Cretaceous LMAR and the relatively high 206Pb/204Pb ratios of these rocks suggest that they formed from primary magmas derived from partial melting of Yangtze Craton (YC) basement material that had undergone ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism. In contrast, the presence of Paleoproterozoic and Archean inherited zircons within early Early Cretaceous LMAR in this area and the relatively low 206Pb/204Pb ratios of these rocks are indicative of derivation from primary magmas generated by partial melting of the thickened lower continental crust of the North China Craton (NCC). These rocks may have formed in an extensional environment associated with the upwelling of asthenospheric mantle material. The presence of YC basement material within the NCC in the Sanmenxia–Houma area suggests that the deeply subducted Yangtze slab influenced an area of ~100 km in lateral extent within the southern margin of the central NCC during the Triassic.

            "abstract": "Annular-mode variability in the extratropical atmosphere is manifested as latitudinal shifts of an eddy-driven polar front jet (PFJ) and associated stormtrack. Climatologically, they are both observed slightly poleward of a midlatitude oceanic front, a confluent region of warm and cool ocean currents, which maintains a surface baroclinic zone against poleward eddy heat transport. A set of “aqua-planet” AGCM experiments with zonally-uniform SST, which mimics the Southern Hemisphere, reveals certain sensitivity of the nodal latitude of anomalous westerlies associated with the annular mode to the latitude of frontal SST gradient. The sensitivity is particularly evident for its positive phase, where PFJ is situated systematically poleward of the SST front at whatever latitude it is located. Insensitively to the frontal latitude, by contrast, PFJ for the negative phase resides near 40° latitude, which nearly corresponds to the climatological PFJ axis that is realized without frontal SST gradient. The annular mode can therefore be interpreted as wobble of the atmospheric circulation system between a regime dominated by thermodynamic influence of frontal SST gradient and that by atmospheric internal dynamics. This notion is found useful for understanding inter-basin differences observed in the wintertime signature of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) that are superimposed on the dominant zonally uniform signature. Compared to its negative phase, the axis of the surface westerlies observed in the positive phase of SAM exhibits stronger latitudinal excursions, which appears to reflect the inter-basin differences in the latitude of the oceanic frontal zone. Implications will be also discussed for the long-term trends in the westerlies over the midlatitude Southern Oceans.",

            "abstract": "The East Asian summer monsoon fluctuates from its climatological activity on monthly and interannual time scales, and the most dominant pattern of the variability is known as the Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern. Characterized by a meridional teleconnection in anomalous activity of the Meiyu/Baiu rainband, tropical storms and a surface subtropical anticyclone (the Bonin High) in between, the PJ pattern exerts substantial influence on summertime climatic conditions over East Asia and the western North Pacific. Despite the recent warming trend observed in its background state, no assessment thus far has been made on how substantially the PJ has undergone, if any, multi-decadal modulations in its structure and/or dominance. Through an EOF analysis applied to a new dataset of global atmospheric reanalysis (JRA-55), the predominance of the PJ pattern is confirmed as being extracted in the leading EOF of lower-tropospheric monthly vorticity anomalies over 55 recent years. Both efficient barotropic/baroclinic energy conversion from the climatological-mean state and efficient generation of available potential energy through anomalous convective activity over the tropical western Pacific are shown to be essential for the maintenance of the monthly atmospheric anomalies of the PJ pattern over the entire 55-year period. At the same time, however, the same EOF analysis as above but applied separately to each of the sub-periods reveals a distinct signature of long-term modulations in amplitude and thus the dominance of the PJ pattern. While being extracted in the first EOF up to the 1980s, the PJ pattern is extracted in the second EOF in the period since the 1990s with marked reductions in both the variance fraction explained and the efficiency of energy conversion/generation. The resultant modulations of the summertime meridional teleconnection are also discussed with implications for future changes.",

            "abstract": "Ultraslow spreading ridges are key regions to unravel mantle processes. Low potential temperatures and reduced melting allow decrypting early melting processes and shad lights on the source short-scale heterogeneities and their interactions with transient melts. Mantle-derived peridotites from the Smoothseafloor region of the eastern Southwest Indian Ridge reveal countertrending Na-Ti relationships. Na apparently behaves as a compatible element during partial melting similarly to light REEs. Heavy REEs, however, follow a normal relationship with the other melting indicators (e.g. Cr#), a behaviour that results in pattern rotation around a pivot element when looking to REE systematic. These relationships can be explained by percolation of relatively enriched, grt-field derived, melts in the spinel-field melting mantle 1. A feature that also explains the inverse Na-Cr# correlation, frequently observed in abyssal mantle rocks. Experimental relationships constraint the grt-field derived melts to be produced by low-melting paragenesis that experience a garnet to spinel phase transition shallower than mantle peridotites for a given temperature. Based on potential mantle temperatures estimated by Cannat et al., 19992, the grt-sp transition can be set at ca. 2.0 and 1.5 GPa for mantle peridotites and Mg pyroxenites respectively with the onset of mantle melting at 1.2 GPa. Mass balance calculations based on the amount of produced melt constrains the pyroxenitic fraction < 10% by mass of the mantle source. The contemporaneous presence of lithologies too depleted with respect to the described process suggests that some portions of the mantle source are inherited from more sustained ancient depletion events not related to present-day processes beneath this ridge portion.\nPNRA funding : PdR 2013/B1.02\n1.

            "abstract": "The Japanese Islands are divided into several crustal blocks [e.g. Loveless and Meade, 2010 JGR]. In the Northern Hokkaido, the boundary between the Amurian and the North American Plates run north-south between 44.0N and 45.4N. The east-west block convergence is considered to be as fast as ~1 cm/year there, but few large earthquakes are known to have occurred along this boundary. Recently, a slow slip event (SSE) is reported to have occurred in a segment at ~45.0N over a 4 months period from 2012 summer to the early 2013 [Ohzono et al., 2014 GJI]. The maximum surface movements was about 15 mm, and the moment magnitude of the SSE would not exceed 6.0 (fault slip is estimated as 10 cm). This suggests that plate convergence takes place as episodic SSEs in this block boundary. In this research, we looked for signatures of repeating SSEs along this block boundary using continuous GNSS data of the dense array GEONET in Japan. In order to detect faint signatures of SSEs in the coordinate time series, we adopted the method using AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion) similar to Nishimura et al. [2013 JGR] and Nishimura [2014 PEPS]. As a result, we were able to find numbers of SSE signals in various segments along the boundary. The detected SSEs are all fairly small, and surface movements did not exceed a few millimeters (except the 2012-2013 SSE reported in Ohzono et al. [2014]). We also searched earthquakes that may have triggered these SSEs. Although the 2012 SSE seems to have been triggered by a deep earthquake beneath Sakhalin on Aug. 14, 2012, no clear triggering earthquakes were identified for other SSEs. SSEs in subduction zones are known to recur fairly regularly, e.g. biannually repeating SSE in the SW part of the Ryukyu Arc [Heki and Kataoka, 2008 JGR]. However, shallow SSEs along the block boundary in the northern Hokkaido did not show such regular occurrences. We plan to confirm these SSE occurrences by comparing GNSS data with the Hi-Net tiltmeter records.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the thermal state of permafrost, a monitoring network with 13 boreholes and 5 automatic weather stations was established over the Upper Reaches of Heihe River Basin in Qilian Mountains of western China from 2011 to 2014. The boreholes were drilled along both east-west transects which is parallel to the Qilian Mountain ridges and the north-south transects. These boreholes with elevation from 3642 m a.s.l. to 4153 m a.s.l., covering different facing-slopes, vegetation cover, land cover, and soil types. Five automatic meteorological stations were established with measurements of soil temperatures within the active layer up to 2 m. In the present study, ground penetrating radar (GPR), mechanical probing and site digging methods were also used to detect active layer thickness (ALT) and permafrost distribution over the Upper Reaches of Heihe River Basin. The results showed that the ground temperature between 18 m and 20 m depth ranged from -1.85 °C to 0.45 °C in this area. There was a significant negative correction between elevation and mean annual ground temperature (MAGT), i.e., MAGT increases -0.65°C for every 100 m. The permafrost thickness varies from nearly 200 m to about 4.3 m. Both the ground temperature and permafrost thickness were significantly influenced by slope aspect, vegetation, surface condition, lithology and groundwater. The ALT was 133 cm with a range of 81~210 cm in eastern tributary and varied from 107 cm at the north-facing slope to 484 cm near the lower limit of permafrost with a mean depth of 271 cm in western tributary. The lower limit of permafrost was found at lowest elevation 3389 m and 3649 m on the north- and south-facing slopes, respectively. The near-zero temperature gradients suggested that recent warming had already penetrated into the ground and influenced the thermal state of permafrost significantly.",

In this context we refer to vegetation structural properties as vertical, horizontal and volumetric dimensions, including: canopy height; amount and distribution of vegetation by height; foliage projective cover (FPC); leaf area index (LAI); and above ground biomass. Our aim was to determine if there were significant differences between vegetation structural properties across 11 ecosystem types in Australia as measured by terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) structure metrics. The ecosystems sampled included: mesophyll vineforest, wet-dry tropical savannah, mallee woodland, subtropical eucalypt forest, mulga woodland/grassland, wet eucalypt forest, dry eucalypt forest, tall and wet eucalypt forest, and desert grassland/shrublands. Canopy height, plant area–height profiles and LAI were calculated from consistently processed TLS data using Australia’s Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network’s (TERN) Supersites by the TERN AusCover remote sensing field teams from 2012-2015. The Supersites were sampled using standardised field protocols within a core set of 1 ha plots as part of a 5 km x 5 km uniform area using a RIEGL-VZ400 waveform recording TLS. Four to seven scans were completed per plot, with one centre point and then at 25 m away from the centre point along transect lines at 0o, 60o and 240o.\nIndividual foliage profiles were sensitive to spatial variation in the distribution of plant materials. Significant differences were visible between each of the vegetation communities assessed when aggregated to plot and ecosystem type scales. Several of the communities exhibited simple profiles with either grass and shrubs (e.g. desert grassland) or grass and trees (e.g. mallee woodland). Others had multiple vegetation forms at different heights, contributing to the profile (e.g. wet eucalypt forest). The TLS data provide significantly more detail about the relative vertical and horizontal distribution of plant materials. TLS data are providing a step change in satellite image based vegetation mapping, and refining our knowledge of vegetation structure and its phenological variability. Open access plot scale TLS measurements are available through the TERN Auscover data portal.",

            "abstract": "Fine-grained suspended sediment in estuarine, coastal and deep-water environments is almost always aggregated and often a distinction is made between smaller and relatively stable microflocs and larger and more fragile macro-flocs. The grain size distribution (GSD) of microflocs tend to be independent on the local hydrodynamic forcing whereas macroflocs typically show strong dependence.\nResuspension of the deposited material is an important process in coastal and estuarine settings and the material may be eroded as individual particles or as aggregates of particles. The relative occurrence of these two types of particles in the erosion of undisturbed, natural sediments has only rarely been studied. In order to examine the contribution of aggregates and single particles to the resuspended material, erosion and settling experiments have been carried out and the GSD of the resuspended particles have been measured. The studies have been carried out in both temperate and tropical estuaries and on inter-tidal and sub-tidal sediments and the results compared to what was found in suspension in those settings. The erosion experiments were carried out with an EROMES erosion chamber and grain size analysis performed with a laboratory set-up of a LISST 100C.\nThe mean grain size of the eroded particles were up to about an order of magnitude larger than the mean grain size of the primary (individual) particles and the GSD of the resuspended material generally showed no dependence on the applied bed stress in the studied range from 0 to 0.5 N m-2. The GSD of the eroded aggregates were generally also very similar to the GSD of the material found in suspension at the sites. Our interpretation is that the GSD of the microflocs in suspension is to a large degree controlled by the aggregation taking place at the bed. This aggregation appears to be dominated by biological processes with fecal pellets being a very prominent component in some environments.",

            "abstract": "To clarify the evolutionary history of Gunnera magellanica (Gunneraceae), an alpine plant of the Andes mountains, we performed molecular phylogeographic analyses based on the sequences of an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and four non-coding regions (trnH-psbA, trnL-trnF, atpB-rbcL, rpl16 intron) of chloroplast DNA. We investigated 3, 4, 4 and 11 populations in, Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile, respectively, and detected six ITS genotypes (Types A–F) in G. magellanica. Five genotypes (Types A–E) were observed in the northern Andes population (Ecuador and Bolivia); only one ITS genotype (Type F) was observed in the southern Andes population (Chile and Argentina). Phylogenetic analyses showed that the ITS genotypes of the northern and southern Andes populations form different clades with high bootstrap probability. Furthermore, network analysis, analysis of molecular variance, and spatial analysis of molecular variance showed that there were two major clusters (the northern and southern Andes populations) in this species. Furthermore, in chloroplast DNA analysis, three major clades (northern Andes, Chillan, and southern Andes) were inferred from phylogenetic analyses using four non-coding regions, a finding that was supported by the above three types of analysis. The Chillan clade is the northernmost population in the southern Andes populations. With the exception of the Chillan clade (Chillan population), results of nuclear DNA and chloroplast DNA analyses were consistent. Both markers showed that the northern and southern Andes populations of G. magellanica were genetically different from each other. This type of clear phylogeographical structure was supported by PERMUT analysis according to Pons & Petit (1995, 1996). Moreover, based on our preliminary estimation that is based on the ITS sequences, the northern and southern Andes clades diverged ~0.63–3 million years ago, during a period of upheaval in the Andes. This suggests that the populations of G. magellanica that were distributed along the Andes have been divided into the two local populations of the northern and southern Andes during the uplift of the Andes.",

            "abstract": "During the last decades investigations at active continental margins discovered the link between the subduction of fluid saturated oceanic plates and the process of ascent of these fluids and partial melts forming a magmatic system that leads to volcanism at the earth surface. For this purpose the geophysical structure of the mantle and crustal range above the down going slap has been imaged. Information is required about the slap, the ascent paths, as well as the reservoires of fluids and partial melts in the mantle and the crust up to the volcanoes at the surface. Statistically the distance between the volcanoes of volcanic arcs down to their Wadati Benioff zone results of approximately 100 kilometers in mean value. Surprisingly, this depth range shows pronounced seismicity at most of all subduction zones. Additionally, mineralogical laboratory investigations have shown that dehydration of the diving plate has a maximum at temperature and pressure conditions we find at around 100 km depth. The ascent of the fluids and the appearance of partial melts as well as the distribution of these materials in the crust can be resolved by seismic tomographic methods using records of local natural seismicity. With these methods these areas are corresponding to lowered seismic velocities, high Vp/Vs ratios, as well as increased attenuation of seismic shear waves. The anomalies and their time dependence are controlled by the fluids. The seismic velocity anomalies detected so far are within a range of a few per cent to more than 30% reduction. But, to explore plate boundaries large and complex amphibious experiments are required, in which active and passive seismic investigations should be combined to achieve best results. The seismic station distribution should cover an area from before the trench up to far behind the volcanic chain, to provide under favorable conditions information down to 150 km depth. Findings of different subduction zones will be compared and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic profiles of the lithosphere–asthenosphere system show zones of high electrical conductivity and electrical anisotropy, which vary with depth. These anomalies can be explained by localized rock deformation near the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary due to the relative motion of tectonic plates and underlying mantle. Such localization may result from a small amount of melt or water in the asthenosphere, reducing viscosity. In particular, the effect of melt on the physical properties of deformed materials at upper-mantle conditions remains poorly constrained.\nHere we present electrical anisotropy measurements at high temperatures and quasi-hydrostatic pressures of about 3 GPa and temperatures up to 1300°C on previously deformed olivine aggregates and sheared partially molten rocks. For all samples, electrical conductivity is highest when parallel to the direction of shear. At temperatures >900°C, a deformed solid matrix with nearly isotropic melt distribution has an electrical anisotropy factor <5. To explain the higher electrical anisotropies observed in our experiments, we propose an experimentally based model in which layers of sheared olivine are alternated with layers of sheared olivine plus MORB or of pure melt. Conductivities are up to 100 times greater in the shear direction than perpendicular to the shear direction and reproduce stress-driven alignment of melt.\nOur results reproduce both the magnitude and the anisotropy of electrical conductivity in various melt-bearing geological contexts. Field data are best fit by an electrically anisotropic asthenosphere overlain by an isotropic, high-conductivity lowermost lithosphere. The high conductivity could arise from partial melting associated with localized deformation resulting from plate motion relative to the mantle, with subsequent upward melt percolation from the asthenosphere. This interpretation appears to be consistent with seismic observations.",

            "abstract": "Key insights into the amounts of plate convergence that have been accommodated as coseismic slip vs. other mechanisms over Holocene time scales are inferred from the timing and amounts of uplift associated with past megathrust earthquakes. A Mw 8.1 earthquake in 2007 helped us calibrate the relationship between megathrust rupture and the geography and amount of vertical displacement by measuring the amounts of coseismic uplift of shallow-living corals. We discovered, mapped and used 230Th ages of ancient in-situ corals extending 20 m higher than those killed by the 2007 uplift to build an uplift history on Ranongga and adjacent islands to reconstruct a series of forearc paleouplifts overlying the seismogenic zone extending from ~4 – 40 km from the trench. Our results are surprising: from mid-Holocene to present, we find distinct spatio-temporal heterogeneity in uplift across different sites that are located close together and find that there are far too few events (by ~50%) in our coral record to accommodate the current Australian-Pacific convergence rate of ~97mm/yr. These findings lead us to suggest that 1. uplift imposed during the 2007 Mw 8.1 event may be retained in some locations but removed in others prior to the next megathrust rupture; and 2. apart from large coseismic megathrust rupture, additional mechanisms such as smaller ruptures, slow slip events or aseismic creep, and/or splay faulting must help to accommodate at least half of the interplate convergence. Thus, we propose that the Western Solomon thrust be visualized as a fault zone, and not simply a fault plane: every time the system accommodates slip, a new set of cards is dealt. Though such a situation may or may not be unique to this region, coral paleogeodesy can provide detailed histories of vertical deformation at locations accruing uplift that can provide a foundation for hypotheses concerning the accommodation of interplate slip.",

The Korean government continues to make concerted efforts to improve air quality. One of the major policies that the Ministry of Environment of Korea enforced is “The Special Act for Improvement of Air Quality in SMA” and “The 1st Air Quality Management Plan of SMA”. Mobile Source emission controls are an important part of the policy. Thus, it is timely to evaluate the air quality improvement due to the controls. Therefore, we performed a quantitative analysis of the difference in air quality using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and December, 2011 was set as the target period to capture the impact of the above control plans.\nWe considered four fuel-type vehicle emission scenarios and compared the air quality improvement differences between them. The scenarios are as follows: no-control, gasoline vehicle control only, diesel vehicle control only, and control of both; utilizing the revised mobile source emissions from the Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS), which is the national emission inventory reflecting current policy.\nIn order to improve the accuracy of the modeling data, we developed new temporal allocation coefficients based on traffic volume observation data and spatially reallocated the mobile source emissions using vehicle flow survey data. Furthermore, we calculated the PM10 and PM2.5 emissions of gasoline vehicles which is omitted in CAPSS.\nThe results of the air quality modeling shows that vehicle control plans for both gasoline and diesel lead to a decrease of 0.65ppb~8.75ppb and 0.02㎍/㎥~7.09㎍/㎥ in NO2 and PM10 monthly average concentrations, respectively. The large percentage decreases mainly appear near the center of the metropolis. However, the largest NO2 decrease percentages are found in the northeast region of Gyeonggi-do, which is the province that surrounds the capital of Seoul. Comparing the results between the different scenarios, diesel vehicle control impact dominates relative to the impact of gasoline control. The diesel-only reduction plan shows that NO2 and PM10 improved by 2.93ppb and 3.32㎍/㎥, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Towards an effort to quantify the effects of rainforests to oil palm conversion on land-atmosphere carbon, water and energy fluxes, a specific plant functional type (PFT) and sub-canopy structure are developed for simulating oil palm within the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). Current global land surface models only simulate annual crops beside natural vegetation. In this study, a multilayer oil palm subroutine is developed in CLM4.5 for simulating oil palm's phenology and carbon and nitrogen allocation. The oil palm has monopodial morphology and sequential phenology of around 40 stacked phytomers, each carrying a large leaf and a fruit bunch, forming a natural multilayer canopy. A sub-canopy phenological and physiological parameterization is thus introduced, so that multiple phytomer components develop simultaneously but according to their different phenological steps (growth, yield and senescence) at different canopy layers. This specific multilayer structure was proved useful for simulating canopy development in terms of leaf area index (LAI) and fruit yield in terms of carbon and nitrogen outputs in Jambi, Sumatra (Fan et al. 2015).\nThe study supports that species-specific traits, such as palm’s monopodial morphology and sequential phenology, are necessary representations in terrestrial biosphere models in order to accurately simulate vegetation dynamics and feedbacks to climate. Further, oil palm's multilayer structure allows adding all canopy-level calculations of radiation, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and respiration, beside phenology, also to the sub-canopy level, so as to eliminate scale mismatch problem among different processes. A series of adaptations are made to the CLM model. Initial results show that the adapted multilayer radiative transfer scheme and the explicit represention of oil palm's canopy structure improve on simulating photosynthesis-light response curve. The explicit photosynthesis and dynamic leaf nitrogen calculations per canopy layer also enhance simulated CO2 flux when compared to eddy covariance flux data. More investigations on energy and water fluxes and nitrogen balance are being conducted. These new schemes would hopefully promote the understanding of climatic effects of the tropical land use transformation system.",

            "abstract": "The Walvis Ridge forms the NE portion of the Tristan-Gough hotspot track. It links the Etendeka large igneous province (LIP) in Africa, initially connected to the Parana LIP in South America, to the Guyot Province, that ends at the active volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough. After the plume head stage, the hotspot changed from a ridge-centered plume tail, forming the Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise (130-60 Ma), to an intraplate setting resulting in the geochemical distinct Tristan and Gough subtracks (Rohde et al. 2013; Geology 41). New major and trace element and radiogenic isotope data have been generated from 36 new dredge locations on the Walvis Ridge during R/V Sonne cruises SO233 and SO234. Based on the bathymetric data, we have identified tectonic structures and subsidence rates which indicate a complex geodynamic interplay of the Walvis Ridge formation and westward migration of the Mid Atlantic Ridge and the Rio Grande Rise. Our new results confirm that the age-progressive basement of the Walvis Ridge reflects only the enriched Gough component with no evidence of the Tristan component being present (Hoernle et al., 2015; Nat. Comm.). Superimposed large seamounts (including ridge- and guyot-like structures), especially in the SE portion of the Walvis Ridge, belong to a later-stage of alkalic volcanism with distinct HIMU incompatible element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic composition. The HIMU late-stage volcanism (206Pb/204Pb up to 20.8) is similar in composition to St. Helena and a late-stage (Eocene) sample from the Rio Grande Rise (Rohde et al., 2013; Tectonophysics 604). The new geochemical, bathymetric and existing age data indicate a magmatic reactivation c. 20-40 Ma after the formation of the Walvis Ridge basement, which may be related to passage of the Walvis Ridge over a batch of upwelling St. Helena type plume material. Our new results indicate a more complex formation of the Walvis Ridge than previously thought, which included two major phases of formation separated by a time gap of c. 20-40 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Rockfall ages in tectonically active regions provide information regarding frequency and magnitude of earthquakes. Such rockfalls have been dated using several methods including lichonometry modeling, radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating of material buried beneath boulders, and the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in exposed boulder faces. In the hyper-arid environment of the Dead Sea fault (DSF), southern Israel, rockfalls are most probably triggered by earthquakes. We dated rockfalls along the western margin of the DSF using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN). In Timna, where the exposure history of the boulders is relatively simple, we recognize three discrete rockfall events, at 31 ka, 15ka, and 4.5ka. However, the ages of the majority of the boulders concentrate at ~4.5 ka. In Shehoret, where boulder exposure ages are more complicated, samples were collected from simultaneously exposed conjugate boulders and cliff surfaces. Pre-rockfall inheritance and post-rockfall production rates of TCN cannot be evaluated in a straightforward way. We developed a numerical code that suggests most-likely rockfall ages between 3.6±0.8 and 4.7±0.7 ka. Our ages agree with dated earthquakes determined in various paleoseismic studies along the entire length of the DSF and support the observation of intensive earthquake activity around 4-5 ka. Our rockfall record, however, under represents the regional earthquake record derived from historic and paleoseismic records. This under representation implies that either the ongoing development of detachment cracks prior to triggering event is slower than the earthquake cycle or that most boulder piles are formed only during big and rare earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Though essential for informed decision-making, it is challenging to estimate the air quality and public health impacts associated with current and future energy generation scenarios because the analysis must address the complicated atmospheric processes that air pollutants undergo: emissions, dispersion, chemistry, and removal. Employing a chemical transport model (CTM) is the most rigorous way to address these atmospheric processes. However, CTMs are expensive from a computational standpoint and, therefore, beyond the reach of policy analysis for many types of problems. On the other hand, previously available reduced-form models used for policy analysis fall short of the rigor of CTMs and may lead to biased results. To address this gap, we developed the Estimating Air pollution Social Impacts Using Regression (EASIUR) method, which builds parameterizations that predict per-tonne social costs and intake fractions for pollutants emitted from any location in the United States. Derived from a large database of tagged CTM simulations, the EASIUR method predicts social costs almost indistinguishable from a full CTM but with negligible computational requirements. We found that the average mortality-related social costs from inorganic PM2.5 and its precursors in the United States are $150,000-180,000/t EC, $21,000-34,000/t SO2, $4,200-15,000/t NOx, and $29,000-85,000/t NH3. This talk will demonstrate examples of using both CTMs and reduced-form models for assessing air quality impacts associated with current energy production activities as well as a future deployment of carbon capture and sequestration.",

            "abstract": "Landscape heterogeneity is a common natural phenomenon but is seldom considered in current radiative transfer models for predicting the surface reflectance. This paper developed an explicit analytical Radiative Transfer model for heterogeneous Agro-Forestry scenarios (RTAF) by dividing the scenario into non-boundary regions and boundary regions. The scattering contribution of the non-boundary regions that are treated as homogeneous canopies can be estimated from the SAILH model, whereas that of the boundary regions with lengths, widths, canopy heights, and orientations of the field patches, is calculated based on the bidirectional gap probability by considering the interactions and mutual shadowing effects among different patches. The hot spot factor is extended for heterogeneous scenarios, the Hapke model for soil anisotropy is incorporated, and the contributions of the direct and diffuse radiation are separately calculated.\nThe multi-angular airborne observations and the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model simulations were used for validating and evaluating the RTAF model over an agro-forestry scenario in Heihe River Basin, China. It indicates that the RTAF model can accurately simulate the hemispherical-directional reflectance factors (HDRFs) of the heterogeneous agro-forestry scenario, with an RMSE of 0.0016 and 0.0179 in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, respectively. The RTAF model was compared with two widely used models, the dominant cover type (DCT) model and the spectral linear mixture (SLM) model, which either neglected the interactions and mutual shadowing effects between the shelterbets and crops, or did not account for the contribution of the shelterbets. Results suggest that the boundary effect can significantly influence the angular distribution of the HDRFs, and consequently enlarged the HDRF variations between the backward and forward directions in the principle plane. The RTAF model reduced the maximum relative error from 25.7% (SLM) and 23.0% (DCT) to 9.8% in the red band, and from 19.6% (DCT) and 13.7% (SLM) to 8.7% in the NIR band. According to the findings in this paper, the RTAF model provides a promising way to improve the retrieval of biophysical parameters (e.g. leaf area index) from remote sensing data over heterogeneous agro-forestry scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The onset of thermal convection within the outer ice shell of Titan is believed to be at the origin of methane outgassing on Titan (Tobie et al., 2006), a possible factor in Titan’s resurfacing processes (Mitri et al., 2008), and to have a major role in the evolution and tectonic activity of this Saturnian icy satellite (Tobie et al., 2005; Mitri and Showman, 2008; Mitri et al., 2010). Recent measurements of the gravity field (Iess et al., 2010, 2012) and the modeling of the shape and topography (Zebker et al., 2009; Mitri et al., 2014) have recently improved our knowledge of the thermal state and structure of Titan’s outer ice shell. Mitri et al. (2014) found that Titan’s surface topography is consistent with an isostatically compensated ice shell of variable thickness, likely at the present in a thermally conductive state (see also Nimmo and Bills, 2010; Hemingway et al., 2013), overlying a relatively dense (~1200-1350 kg m-3) subsurface ocean. As Titan’s ice shell is not currently experiencing thermal convection it is likely that the ice shell could have experienced during its history both the onset and the cessation of thermal convection; thermal convection could be present within the ice shell for limited times or in fact be episodic.\nWe investigate the evolution of Titan’s outer ice shell from the crystallization of the underlying ocean with a focus on the onset and cessation of thermal convection. To simulate convection in a growing ice shell, we numerically solve the thermal convection equations for a Newtonian rheology in a two dimensional Cartesian domain using finite element method, with a moving bottom boundary to ocean crystallization. We discuss how the crystallization process affects the onset of convection and in which conditions the cessation of thermal convection may occur. The geological consequences of the changes of the thermal state and structure of the outer ice shell will also be discussed.",

Plant δ13C depends on the δ13C of atmospheric CO2 and mean annual precipitation (MAP), but an unresolved decades-long debate centers on whether terrestrial C3 plant δ13C responds to pCO2. Here, the pCO2-dependence of C3 land plant δ13C was tested using isotopic records from low- and high-pCO2 times spanning historical through Eocene data. Historical data do not resolve a clear pCO2-effect (-1.2±1.0 to 0.59±0.34‰/100 ppmv), and organic carbon records of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition implicate changes in MAP and ecosystems, rather than pCO2, as the major driver of δ13C changes. Fossil collagen and tooth enamel data constrain pCO2-effects most tightly to -0.03±0.13 and -0.03±0.24‰/100 ppmv between 200 and 700 ppmv. Combining all constraints yields a preferred value of 0.0±0.2‰/100 ppmv (2 s.e.), i.e. there is effectively no pCO2 effect.

Although the physics of radiative transfer is central to understanding climate, it has played a far smaller role in weather research and is given only rudimentary attention in most educational programs in meteorology. Yet key contemporary problems in atmospheric science, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation and the self-aggregation of moist convection, do not appear to have been solved by approaches based strictly on fluid dynamics and moist adiabatic thermodynamics. Here I will argue that many outstanding problems in meteorology and climate science involve a nontrivial coupling of circulation and radiation physics. In particular, the phenomenon of self-aggregation of moist convection depends on the interaction of radiation with time-varying water vapor and clouds, with strong implications for such diverse problems as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, tropical cyclones, and the relative insensitivity of tropical climate to radiative forcing. This argues for an augmentation of radiative transfer physics in graduate curricula in atmospheric sciences.",

            "abstract": "As one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, West Africa (WA) has since the 1970s suffered sustained reduction in rainfall amounts, leading to droughts and associated negative impacts on its water resources. Although rainfall rates have been reported to have experienced a degree of recovery, dry conditions persist. Additionally, the region faces perennial flooding, thus resulting in a highly variable hydrologic regime due to the extreme climate conditions. This therefore necessitates routine monitoring of the WA’s freshwater reserves and its response to climate variations at the short and long term scales to aid sustainable use and management. However, this monitoring is hampered by data deficiency issues within the region. Consequently, dynamics leading to changes in water availability over the region are not completely understood. In this work, the recent flux and state of freshwater availability over WA from 1979 to 2013 is assessed by investigating the coupled variability of GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) and its changes (TWSC) estimates with rainfall, evapotranspiration, and land surface air temperature (LSAT), as well as, major global and regional teleconnection indices using complex principal component analysis and wavelet transforms. Since GRACE covers a relatively short period, and thereby present challenges for long to medium term analyses, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed to extend the GRACE series to 1979. The results from the ANN proved to be robust upon evaluation; spatially-averaged series for major basins and sub-climatic zones, as well as, the whole of WA presented RMSE, Nash-Sutcliffe efficient, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 11.83 mm, 0.76 and 0.89 respectively. Overall, the results obtained from this study indicate that, sustained increase in water flux, in terms of TWSC, contributed to a resurgence in freshwater reserves in the 21st century over WA from the low levels in the late 20th century. This recovery in TWS exhibits a positive coherence with inter-decadal rainfall and an inversed coupling to inter-decadal evapotranspiration rates. The increased TWS amount, resulting from increased rainfall are primarily driven by low frequency sea surface temperatures oscillations in the Atlantic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "By all sensible metrics, North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity underwent a pronounced decline from the middle of the 20th Century through the 1980s, and then recovered. A rich literature is devoted to the causes is this hurricane drought, with some arguing that it is part of a natural, multi-decadal oscillation of North Atlantic climate, and others pointing to time-varying radiative forcing as the main cause of the drought. In this work I show that the net variability of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity in the second half of the 20th Century has two spectral peaks: One around a single decade and another at a period close to 70 years. I hypothesize that the longer period variability, of which the drought was a part, was principally owing to time-varying radiative forcing, while the quasi-decadal signal is part of a natural oscillation of North Atlantic climate. To test this hypothesis, I present evidence that the two main contributors to time-varying radiative forcing over the period were CO2 variations and aerosol forcing brought about by a combination of sulfate originating in European sulfur emissions and natural mineral dust from the Sahara, and then show that most of the longer-period variations can be statistically explained by a combination of these two forcing agents, at the same time demonstrating that the spatial pattern on this variability is consistent with the radiative forcing hypothesis. On the other hand, the spatial pattern of the quasi-decadal variations is closely aligned with that of the EOFs of natural variability in a large suite of unforced, coupled climate models, suggesting that this quasi-decadal signal is part of a natural oscillation of the North Atlantic climate.",

The remote location of Kavachi and its explosive behavior has restricted scientific exploration of the volcano, limiting observations to surface imagery and peripheral water-column data. An expedition to Kavachi in January 2015 was timed with a rare lull in volcanic activity, allowing for observation of the inside of Kavachi’s caldera and its flanks. Here we present medium-resolution bathymetry of the main peak paired with benthic imagery, petrologic analysis of samples from the caldera rim, measurements of gas flux over the main peak, and hydrothermal plume structure data. A second peak was discovered to the Southwest of the main cone and displayed evidence of diffuse-flow venting. Populations of gelatinous animals, small fish, and sharks were observed inside the active crater, raising new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes. Most equipment used in this study was lightweight, relatively low-cost, and deployed using small boats; these methods may offer developing nations an economic means to explore deep-sea environments within their own territorial waters.",

            "abstract": "The rain-on-snow induced West Salt Creek rock avalanche occurred on May 25, 2014 on the northern flank of Grand Mesa. The avalanche was rare for the contiguous U.S. because of its large size (59 M m3) and high mobility (Length/Height=7.2). To understand the avalanche failure sequence, mechanisms, and mobility, we conducted a forensic analysis using large-scale (1:1000) structural mapping and seismic data. We used high-resolution, Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) imagery as a base for our field mapping and analyzed seismic data from 22 broadband stations (distances <656 km) and one short-period network. We inverted broadband data to derive a time series of forces that the avalanche exerted on the earth and tracked these forces using curves in the avalanche path. Our results revealed that the rock avalanche was a cascade of landslide events, rather than a single massive failure. The sequence began with a landslide/debris flow that started about 10 hours before the main avalanche. The main avalanche lasted just over 3 minutes and traveled at average velocities ranging from 15 to 36 m/s. For at least two hours after the avalanche ceased movement, a central, hummock-rich, strike-slip bound core continued to move slowly. Following movement of the core, numerous shallow landslides, rock slides, and rock falls created new structures and modified topography. Mobility of the main avalanche and central core were likely enhanced by valley floor material that liquefied from undrained loading by the overriding avalanche. Although the base was likely at least partially liquefied, our mapping indicates that the overriding avalanche internally deformed predominantly by sliding along discrete shear surfaces in material that was nearly dry and had substantial frictional strength. These results indicate that the West Salt Creek avalanche, and probably other long-traveled avalanches, could be modeled as two layers: a liquefied basal layer; and a thicker and stronger overriding layer.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric composition is rapidly changing in response to changes in industrialization, land-use, and climate. Tropospheric ozone is at the nexus of atmospheric chemistry, air-quality, and climate as it is not only the third most important greenhouse gas and a primary air pollutant, but also affects carbon dioxide by damaging plants and the lifetime of atmospheric methane by influencing the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere.\nObserved trends in free-tropospheric ozone as observed by ozone-sondes and more recently by satellite measurements from the Aura TES and IASI instruments do not agree with models that are driven by observed changes in ozone pre-cursor emissions. As a consequence, estimates of ozone radiative forcing and the future trajectory of tropospheric ozone concentrations are highly uncertain. In this study, we explore the use of satellite observations of ozone and its pre-cursors for constraining the sensitivity of Northern hemispheric tropospheric ozone to anthropogenic emissions. New measurements of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) from the Aura TES instrument suggest that one explanation for the model/data mismatch in trends is reduced ventilation of reactive nitrogen into the free-troposphere over Asia. Ultimately, continued well validated observation of ozone and its pre-cursors from IASI, AIRS, CRIS, and Trop-OMI will be needed to solve this critical scientific question.",

            "abstract": "The KP province of Pakistan hosts widespread deposits of thermo-metamorphic marbles that were extensively used as a building and ornamental stones since the time of earliest flourishing civilization in this region known as Indus Valley Civilization (2500 BC). The macroscopic characteristics of 22 marble varieties collected from three different areas of Lesser Himalayas (Northwest Pakistan), its chemical, mineralogical, petrographic features, temperature conditions of metamorphic re-crystallization, and the main physical properties are presented in order to provide a solid basis for possible studies on the provenance and distribution of building stones from this region. The results provide a set of diagnostic parameters that allow discriminating the investigated marbles and quarries. Studied marbles overlap in major phase assemblage, but the accessory mineral content, chemistry, the maximum grain size (MGS) and other petrographic characteristics are particularly useful in the distinction between them. On the basis of macroscopic features, the studied marbles can be classifies into four groups: (i) white (ii) grey-to-brown veined, (iii) brown-reddish to yellowish and (iv) dark-grey to blackish veined marbles. The results show that the investigated marbles are highly heterogeneous in both their geochemical parameters and minero-petrographic features. Microscopically, the white, grey-to-brown and dark-grey to blackish marbles display homeoblastic/granoblastic texture, and the brown-reddish to yellowish marbles display a heteroblastic texture with traces of slightly deformed polysynthetic twining planes. Minero-petrography, XRD, SEM and EPMA revealed that the investigated marbles chiefly consist of calcite along with dolomite, quartz, muscovite, pyrite, K-feldspar, Mg, Ti and Fe-oxides as subordinates. The magnesium content of calcite coexisting with dolomite was estimated by both XRD and EPMA/EDS, indicating the metamorphic temperature of re-crystallization from 414 – 628oC. The multi-analytical approach applied in the present study allows the best possible discrimination. The detailed databank relating to the quarried material, created here for the first time, provides a solid basis for possible studies on the provenance and distribution of building stones from these areas.",

We prospectively and retrospectively analyzed the transient variations of three different physical parameters – outgoing earth radiation (OLR), GPS/TEC and the thermodynamic proprieties in the lower atmosphere. These changes characterize the state of the atmosphere and ionosphere several days before the onset of this earthquake. Our preliminary results show that in mid March 2015 a rapid increase of emitted infrared radiation was observed from the satellite data and an anomaly near the epicenter reached the maximum on April 21-22. The ongoing analysis of satellite radiation revealed another transient anomaly on May 3th, probably associated with the M7.3 of May 12, 2015. The analysis of air temperature form ground stations show similar patterns of rapid increases offset 1-2 days earlier to the satellite transient anomalies.The GPS/TEC data indicate an increase and variation in electron density reaching a maximum value during April 22-24. We found a strong negative TEC anomaly in the crest of EIA (Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly) on April 21st and strong positive on April 24th, 2015.

            "abstract": "Measurements of particulate matter (PM) emissions generated from fugitive sources are of interest in air pollution studies, since such emissions vary widely both spatially and temporally. This research focuses on determining the uncertainties in quantifying fugitive PM emission factors (EFs) generated from mobile vehicles using a vertical scanning micro-pulse lidar (MPL). The goal of this research is to identify the greatest sources of uncertainty of the applied lidar technique in determining fugitive PM EFs, and to recommend methods to reduce the uncertainties in this measurement. The MPL detects the PM plume generated by mobile fugitive sources that are carried downwind to the MPL’s vertical scanning plane. Range-resolved MPL signals are measured, corrected, and converted to light extinction coefficients, through inversion of the lidar equation and calculation of the lidar ratio. In this research, both the near-end and far-end lidar equation inversion methods are considered. Range-resolved PM mass concentrations are then determined from the extinction coefficient measurements using the measured mass extinction efficiency (MEE) value, which is an intensive PM property. MEE is determined by collocated PM mass concentration and light extinction measurements, provided respectively by a DustTrak and an open-path laser transmissometer. These PM mass concentrations are then integrated with wind information, duration of plume event, and vehicle distance travelled to obtain fugitive PM EFs. To obtain the uncertainty of PM EFs, uncertainties in MPL signals, lidar ratio, MEE, and wind variation are considered. Error propagation method is applied to each of the above intermediate steps to aggregate uncertainty sources. Results include determination of uncertainties in each intermediate step, and comparison of uncertainties between the use of near-end and far-end lidar equation inversion methods.",

            "abstract": "The devitrification of glass in geological systems is of interest for many reasons. One means of quantitatively tracking the process is to measure the thermoluminescence (TL) sensitivity of the samples, i.e. the light produced by a sample as it is heated in the laboratory after exposure to a standard radiation dose, the natural TL signal having been previously removed. As crystallization occurs, the TL signal increases as luminescent crystals form in the glass. Kinetic studies of the devitrification of glass in basalts suggest that it the process takes many millions of years suggesting that TL sensitivity might be able to date lavas over this time-range.\nWe collected five samples of basalt flows at the Craters of the Moon, Idaho, and surrounding areas as part of the FINESSE team, a member of SSERVI. Radiocarbon and Ar-Ar ages are 6500, 6600, 57,000, 116,000, and 120,000 years. After grinding to ~200 mm grains, 4 mg aliquots were placed in a TL rig and heated to 500oC to remove their natural TL signal. They were then irradiated with a 150 mCi 90Sr beta source for 3 minutes and the TL induced was measured.\nThe TL counts obtained for these samples, in order of increasing age, are 150±25, 88.3±10, 153±53, 616±160, 533±76, the uncertainty being based on triplicate measurements. These data yield a relationship between TL sensitivity and age of Age = 232 x TL sensitivity – 1.638 x 104 with an R2 = 0.97.\nMany factors that influence the rate of devitrification need to be addressed before a quantitative method of dating, independent of isotopic methods, can be claimed. The composition of the glass, the amount of water in the basalt, and storage temperature, are all important factors. However, this small pilot study is encouraging and will be extended by further measurements of basalts from Idaho and Hawai’i before deciding whether it is worth investigating the complicating factors.",

So is the range of applications that include warnings against rainfall-induced hazards as well as resources monitoring. All these activities require some level of validation. In many places, where there is no alternative to satellite products, a simple naïve validation is sufficient. The users decide if the product helps them fulfill their responsibility. A more rigorous validation (evaluation) of the products is possible where an independent reference exists. If the focus is on flood prediction, the reference may include streamflow observations and hydrologic rainfall-runoff models. A key evaluation issue is satellite product uncertainty and performance characterization across scales and within a hydrologic context. The author demonstrates that simple examination of hydrograph at the outlet of a basin can be misleading. Using data collected during the Iowa Flood Studies Ground Validation field campaign, he presents a spatio-dynamic framework as a more comprehensive tool for product evaluation. He also demonstrates how hydrologic validation can help in specifying scale-dependent accuracy requirements for space-based products. Different applications may lead to different requirements.",

            "abstract": "Recent paleoceanographic reconstructions of subpolar North Atlantic variability during the last millennium describe oceanic conditions associated with a stronger subpolar gyre (SPG) during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950-1250 CE) followed by a weak phase during the Little Ice Age (1450-1850 CE). Yet the mechanism behind this relatively abrupt SPG shift remains unclear. Here, we investigate the SPG dynamics during the last millennium in an ensemble of three transient climate simulations performed with the Max Planck Institute-Earth system model. In particular, we focus on the dynamics underlying a decadal-scale SPG transition from an initial strong to a later weak state, which is found in one of the simulations and whose features are similar to the reconstructed event.\nOur results indicate that the simulated shift is triggered by a rapid increase in the freshwater transport from the Arctic toward the subpolar North Atlantic, which causes a broad freshening of the upper Labrador Sea. As a result, upper ocean densities largely decrease in the area, leading to a shut-down of oceanic deep mixing and, eventually, to a substantial weakening of the SPG. This event triggers a series of long-lasting feedbacks relating anomalous oceanic and atmospheric circulations, sea-ice extent, deep water formation in the Labrador Sea, and upper-ocean east-west density gradient within the SPG, all contributing to maintain the North Atlantic in an anomalous state for at least 200 years. A reorganization of the North Atlantic/Arctic ocean-atmosphere coupled system sustained by internal feedbacks acting on multicentennial time scales can therefore be initiated by changes in the SPG. Such reorganization, by contrast, does not depend on a long-lasting weakening of the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation or a shift in large-scale modes of atmospheric variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. The simulated SPG shift occurs right after a cluster of relatively small volcanic eruptions, which induces prominent thickening of the Arctic ice cap previous to the SPG shift. However, sensitivity experiments in which the volcanic forcing is removed can also show a similar abrupt SPG shift, pointing to a central role of internal climate variability in its inception.",

            "abstract": "Source-to-sink sediment routing across the Earth’s surface controls the evolution of continental margins. We measure sediment budgets in two small, tectonically active sediment-routing systems of Southern California, including the geologic provinces of the Transverse (north) and Peninsular (south) ranges, using cosmogenic radionuclide-derived denudation rates (averaging over 10^3 years) and submarine-fan sediment accumulation rates (>10^4 years of measurement) since the last glacial maximum (~20 ka). The surface areas and headwater elevations of Transverse and Peninsular ranges catchments are similar; however, the orographic effect of the Transverse ranges on El Niño-Southern Oscillation storms likely resulted in increased rainfall. The catchments of the Transverse ranges are also composed of rapidly uplifting (<5.0 mm/yr), and easily eroded Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary rocks compared to the core of the Peninsular ranges. Accordingly, the mass denudation rates of the Transverse ranges and sediment accumulation rates in submarine fans are ~3 times greater than the rates of the Peninsular ranges and submarine fans to the south. In both sediment-routing systems, submarine-fan mass accumulation exceeds terrestrial denudation by a factor of ~1.5. This imbalance might result from the fact that cosmogenic radionuclide-derived denudation rates average over shorter timescales than submarine-fan sediment accumulation rates; therefore, they do not account for sediment production during periods of greater precipitation and/or lower sea level during the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. Additional sediment supply to the submarine fans might be from unaccounted beach-cliff erosion. These results show sediment-budget variability in nearby geologic provinces owed to differences in climate, catchment lithology, and tectonic uplift. However, both the Transverse and Peninsular ranges catchments are measured to have less sediment production than offshore accumulation in submarine fans. These examples are representative of a globally significant class of small, tectonically active sediment-routing systems, in which sediment dispersal is sensitive to geologic variability, such as underlying lithology and dynamic topographic evolution.",

            "abstract": "A new array-based method for seismic waveform data is developed to not only detect small-scale heterogeneities in the mantle but also constrain their possible geometries. Detecting small-scale heterogeneities using scattered waves has been challenging because scattered phases usually suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios, and determining the shapes of such heterogeneities is even more difficult because of isochronal artifacts. In the proposed method, the problem of the low signal-to-noise ratio is addressed by adopting dual bootstrap stack, which can detect weak signals even with a limited number of channels, as well as by ensuring reproducibility among different events. The geometries of detected scatterers are then estimated using a new kind of hierarchical cluster analysis that could minimize the effect of isochronal artifacts. The new method is applied to a previously analyzed data set of Mariana earthquakes to facilitate a comparison with conventional methods. In the mantle beneath the Mariana trench region, a total of 39 scatterers are identified, with their potential volumes ranging from ~8x10^4 to ~1x10^6 km^3.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important state variable that influences water flow and solute transport in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system, and plays a key role in securing agricultural ecosystem services for nutrition and food security. Especially when environmental studies should be carried out at relatively large spatial scales, there is a need to synthesize the complex interactions between soil, plant behavior, and local atmospheric conditions. Although it relies on the somewhat loosely defined concepts of “field capacity” and “wilting point”, the soil water-holding capacity seems a suitable indicator to meet the above-mentioned requirement, yet easily understandable by the public and stakeholders. This parameter is employed in this work to evaluate the effectiveness of phytoremediation protocols funded by the EU-Life project EcoRemed and being implemented to remediate and restore contaminated agricultural soils of the National Interest Priority Site Litorale Domizio-Agro Aversano. The study area is located in the Campania Region (Southern Italy) and has an extent of about 200,000 hectares. A high-level spotted soil contamination is mostly due to the legal or outlaw industrial and municipal wastes, with hazardous consequences also on groundwater quality. With the availability of soil and land systems maps for this study area, disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected at two different soil depths to determine basic soil physico-chemical properties for the subsequent application of pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions were determined for a number of soil cores, in the laboratory with the evaporation experiments, and used to calibrate the PTFs. Efficient mapping of the soil hydraulic properties benefitted greatly from the use of the PTFs and the physically-based scaling procedure developed by Nasta et al. (2013, WRR, 49:4219-4229).",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal vents are thermally and geochemically dynamic habitats, and the organisms therein are subject to steep fluctuations in temperature and chemistry. To date, the influence of these environmental dynamics on microbial sulfate reduction has not been well constrained. Here, via multivariate experiments, we evaluate the effects of key environmental variables (temperature, pH, H2S, SO42-, DOC) on sulfate reduction rates and metabolic energy yields in a hydrothermal flange recovered from the Grotto vent in the Main Endeavor Field, Juan de Fuca ridge. Sulfate reduction was measured in batch reactions across a range of physico-chemical conditions. Temperature and pH were the strongest stimuli and maximum sulfate reduction rates were observed at 50°C and pH 6, suggesting that the in situ community of sulfate reducing organisms at Grotto may be most active in a slightly acidic and moderate thermal/chemical regime. At pH 4, sulfate reduction rates increased with sulfide concentrations most likely due to the mitigation of metal toxicity. While substrate concentrations also influenced sulfate reduction rates, energy-rich conditions muted the effect of metabolic energetics on sulfate reduction rates. We posit that variability in sulfate reduction rates reflect the response of the active microbial consortia to environmental constraints on in situ microbial physiology, toxicity, and the type and extent of energy limitation. These experiments help to constrain models of the spatial contribution of heterotrophic sulfate within the complex gradients inherent to hydrothermal deposits.",

Previous studies have showed that 80–90 % of global losses and 53 % of total cyclone-related deaths worldwide, occur in Bangladesh and out of which, 42% of cyclone-caused deaths were recorded in the last two centuries. The Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) is a unique joint program under the initiative of Government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Red Crescent Society that provides a robust cyclone early warning (CEW) system for the 13 coastal districts in Bangladesh. CPP ensures rapid dissemination of official Bangladesh Meteorological Department’s CEW signals to these communities. However, inconsistent CEW services are reported in several of these coastal communities. This study offered the quality assessment of CPP CEW services in Nijhum Island, a highly populated remotely located off-shore island in Bangladesh. Primary rural appraisal (household survey, focus group discussion and expert interview) were used for field data collection and Likert scale, for data analysis. Study revealed that cyclone early warning signal dissemination were restricted to small area covering only 35 percent of the total population. Moreover, local inhabitants had very poor understanding about disseminated CEW signals (flag signaling system, signal number & severity) although CPP initiated several training program to build and raise awareness. Consequently, people remained inactive during cyclone and reluctant to seek shelter which resulted in lack of proper post-disaster management. Moreover, local people had concern regarding accuracy of CEW signals disseminated by CPP. To ensure last mile connectivity of CEW services, it is highly recommended that local people should be given more training and awareness on CEW signals and how to respond to the same.",

Predicting variations in this environment that can affect technologies in space and on Earth, i.e. “space weather”, remains a big space physics challenge. We present a recently funded project through the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program that is developing a new capability to understand, model, and predict Space Hazards Induced near Earth by Large Dynamic Storms, the SHIELDS framework. The project goals are to specify the dynamics of the hot (keV) particles (the seed population for the radiation belts) on both macro- and micro-scale, including important physics of rapid particle injection and acceleration associated with magnetospheric storms/substorms and plasma waves. This challenging problem is addressed using a team of world-class experts in the fields of space science and computational plasma physics and state-of-the-art models and computational facilities. New data assimilation techniques employing data from LANL instruments on the Van Allen Probes and geosynchronous satellites are developed in addition to physics-based models. This research will provide a framework for understanding of key radiation belt drivers that may accelerate particles to relativistic energies and lead to spacecraft damage and failure. The ability to reliably distinguish between various modes of failure is critically important in anomaly resolution and forensics. SHIELDS will enhance our capability to accurately specify and predict the near-Earth space environment where operational satellites reside.",

            "abstract": "The radiative forcing (RF) of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the leading contribution to climate change from anthropogenic activities. Calculating CO2 RF requires detailed knowledge of spectral line parameters and lineshape functions for thousands of infrared absorption lines. A reliable spectroscopic characterization of CO2 forcing is therefore a critical input to scientific and policy-oriented assessments of present climate and future climate change. Our study is partly motivated by a recent assertion that CO2 RF values, and hence predictions of climate sensitivity to elevated CO2, have a significant high bias because the CO2 spectroscopic parameters being used are incorrect. Our results show that CO2 RF in a variety of atmospheres is remarkably insensitive to known uncertainties in the three main CO2 spectroscopic parameters: the line strengths, half widths, and line shapes. We demonstrate that this is due largely to the definition of CO2 RF, which is the difference between the CO2 longwave net flux at the tropopause for doubled CO2 concentrations from the preindustrial era. We also assess the effects of sub-Lorentzian wings of CO2 lines and find that the computed RF is largely insensitive to the spectral lineshape function. Overall, the spectroscopic uncertainty in present-day CO2 RF is less than a few percent. Our study highlights the basics and subtleties of RF calculations, addressing interests of the expert and non-expert.",

            "abstract": "Chemical composition analysis of atmospheric aerosols is of considerable interest and has been facilitated by mass spectrometry. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a suitable mode of ion generation of many organic species comprising aerosol particles, as it leads to minimal analyte fragmentation. However, particles exist in the atmosphere at mass concentrations of the order 10 µg/m3 or less in many environments and are highly heterogeneous; low concentrations and chemical complexity have limited ESI application in aerosol analysis. In this presentation, the development of an approach to apply ESI to molecules within submicrometer and nanometer scale aerosol particles is discussed. The technique, which we term electrostatic precipitation-ESI-MS (EP-ESI-MS), utilizes unipolar ionization to charge particles, electrostatic precipitation to collect particles on the tip of a tungsten rod, and subsequently, by flowing liquid over the rod, ESI and mass analysis of dissolved species originating from the collected particles. EP-ESI-MS is shown to enable analysis of nanogram quantities of collected inorganic and organic components. Furthermore, it is coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry and challenged with oxidation products of α-pinene to investigate its capability of enabling structure analysis of complex organic compounds in aerosol particles. With EP-ESI-MS, the identification of chemical components in aerosol particles is realized and the integrated mass spectrometric signals are found to be a monotonic function of the analyte mass concentration in the aerosol phase. Additionally, it is shown to have a dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude in mass, making it suitable for molecular analysis of aerosol particles in laboratory settings, as well as analysis of atmospheric aerosols in ambient air.",

            "abstract": "The linkage between climate change and increased frequency/magnitude of weather extremes remains an open question in the scientific field. Here we investigate such a dynamical linkage by focusing on an amplification trend of the northern subtropical stationary waves found in recent decades. Specifically, we show that in multiple modern reanalysis products, a robust positive trend exists in a wave amplitude index defined through summer-mean tropospheric stream function field. Pronounced changes in the subtropical atmospheric circulation accompany this wave amplification, including intensified South Asian monsoon and strengthened subtropical highs over the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. Through modifying characteristics of large-scale moisture transport, these circulation changes are in turn coupled with changes in regional precipitation amount and the occurrence of water extremes including both droughts and heavy rainfall events. Given this connection, the amplified stationary waves have likely contributed to the elevated occurrence probabilities of droughts in the central United States, Mexico, Japan and northern China as well as those of heavy rainfall events in South Asia, southeastern China and eastern United States. Since the amplifying stationary waves are a robust feature in models’ projection of future climate, our results suggest an increased risk of water extremes over the above-mentioned regions in the near future.",

            "abstract": "In natural subsurface systems, total elemental fluxes are often heavily influenced by areas of disproportionately high reaction rates. These pockets of high reaction rates tend to occur at interfaces, such as the hyporheic zone, where a hydrologic flowpath converges with either a chemically distinct hydrologic flowpath or a reactive substrate. Understanding the affects that these highly reactive zones have on the behavior of shallow subsurface systems is integral to the accurate quantification of nutrient fluxes and biogeochemical cycling. Numerical simulations of these systems may be able to offer some insight. To that end, we have developed a new reactive transport model, ParFlow.RT, by coupling the parallel flow and transport code ParFlow with the geochemical engines of both PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow. The coupling was accomplished via the Alquimia biogeochemistry API, which provides a unified interface to several geochemical codes and allows a relatively simple implementation of advanced geochemical functionality in flow and transport codes. This model uses an operator-splitting approach, where the transport and reaction steps are solved separately. Here, we present the details of this new model, and the results of verification simulations and biogeochemical cycling simulations of the DOE's East River field site outside of Gothic, CO. ",

Although total annual sediment yield has been monitored through time, sediment transport during individual storm events is less certain. At a study site on North Fork Caspar Creek, cross-section averaged sediment flux was collected throughout two storm events in December 2014 and February 2015 to determine if two commonly used sediment transport equations—Meyer-Peter-Müller and Wilcock—approximated observed bedload transport. Cross-section averaged bedload samples were collected approximately every hour during each storm event using a Helley-Smith bedload sampler. Five-minute composite samples were collected at five equally spaced locations along a cross-section and then sieved to half-phi sizes to determine the grain size distribution. The measured sediment flux values varied widely throughout the storm hydrographs and were consistently less than two orders of magnitude in value in comparison to the calculated values. Armored bed conditions, changing hydraulic conditions during each storm and variable sediment supply may have contributed to the observed differences.",

Leaks from Canadian natural gas wells in rocks underlying Lake Erie are a potential contributor to CH4 emissions. Previous work shows that Lake Erie is a positive source of CH4 to the atmosphere in late summer, with some evidence for enhanced CH4 emissions from regions with natural gas wells. This study updates past CH4 emission studies of Lake Erie, utilizing stable isotopic composition to determine the distribution of CH4 sources. d13C-CH4 ratios were measured using the University of Cincinnati’s isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Samples collected in late summer of 2013, during the period of widespread hypoxia in the central basin, indicate d13C-CH4 enrichment in locations near gas wells. This is consistent with previous studies showing that thermogenic CH4 is enriched in 13C relative to biological CH4. The d13C-CH4 in water at hypoxic sites is -58.6 ‰, while locations near gas wells average d13C of -42.5 ‰. Concentrations of CH4 in bottom waters were similar in both hypoxic and natural gas extraction regions. This preliminary data will be further assisted by isotopic data obtained during spring and summer of 2014. In addition, recent samples gathered early summer 2015 are currently under analysis, and fieldwork scheduled for late summer and fall 2015 will further build on this data set. Ongoing work includes additional measurements of hydrogen isotopic composition of methane and CH4 efflux throughout the year.",

Assessing the Pleistocene fan development and depocenter migration in the upper 150-220 m of the Bengal Fan was a primary goal of this expedition. Because any one site includes local variations in depositional processes, the transect approach and accurate stratigraphic correlation of sites is essential to understand overall fan development. Within this transect framework, integrating sediment fluxes across the fan allows for reconstruction of regional climate and tectonic signals through time. A hemipelagic unit deposited at ~1-2.5 cm/ka late in the Matuyama Chron, recording both the Cobb Mountain (1.173 – 1.185 Ma) and Jaramillo (0.988 – 1.072 Ma) Subchrons, was observed at all sites across the transect. This hemipelagic unit provides robust correlation between core derived chronologies and seismic imaging in the Middle Pleistocene. Correlation and orbital tuning of distinctive variations in physical properties (e.g. sediment lightness, wet-bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility) relative to paleomagnetic reversals indicate that turbidite deposition immediately below the base of this unit ceased relatively synchronously across the transect and turbidite deposition likely occurred elsewhere on the fan. The upper bound of the unit, however, is diachronous, with the timing of the onset of turbidite deposition in this part of the fan likely related to the infilling of accommodation space on the Middle Pleistocene fan surface. Stratigraphic constraints on the resumption of turbidite deposition to transect sites include the upper Jaramillo (0.988 Ma) and Matuyama-Bruhnes (0.780 Ma) polarity boundaries and the Oldest Toba Tephra (~0.800 ± 0.020 Ma).

            "abstract": "The El Jefe geyser in the Atacama Desert, Chile has been the subject of study to better understand processes of heat transport and eruption mechanisms in geyser systems (Munoz-Saez et al., 2015). Existing seismological literature on geyser and volcanic systems is predominantly focused on seismicity generated in the eruptive process (Benoit and McNutt, 1997; O’Brien et al., 2011). In contrast, this study leverages seismic noise in the repose period to generate an approximation to the Green’s function for each receiver pair, known as noise correlation functions (NCFs). A dense seismic array of 51 geophones spaced at 2-10 meter intervals recorded several days of data at a spatial scale and frequency range approximately two orders of magnitude removed from prior seismic interferometry studies. While eruptions of the El Jefe geyser impose a transient signal on a diffuse background noise, a regular eruption interval of 132.52.5 seconds (Munoz-Saez et al., 2015) allows for reliable removal of seismic energy associated with the eruption, improving the azimuthal distribution of noise across the array.\nThe approach to generating noise correlation functions closely follows the methodology of Seats and Lawrence (2014). Moveout of at least two phases of energy is apparent in the calculated NCFs, suggesting that multiple phases of seismic energy may be present in the noise, moving coherently across the array.",

            "abstract": "In previous studies we have identified structures created by nano-dust in the solar wind, and we have observed the expected draping and diverting signatures of such structures using well-spaced multi-spacecraft observations. In this study, we reproduce such an interaction event with our multi-fluid MHD model, modeling the dust particles as a fluid. When the number density of dust particles is comparable to the solar wind ions, a significant draping in the IMF is created, with amplitude larger than the ambient fluctuations. We note that such a density is well above several nano dust particles per Debye sphere and a dusty fluid is appropriate for modeling the dust-solar wind interaction. We assume a spherical cloud of dust travelling with 90% solar wind speed. In addition to reproducing the IMF response to the nano-dust at the end-stage of dust acceleration, we model the entire process of such acceleration in the gravity field of the inner heliosphere. It takes hours for the smallest dust with 3000 amu per proton charge to reach the solar wind speed. We find the dust cloud stretched along the solar wind flow. Such stretching enhances the draping of IMF, compared to the spherical cloud we used in an earlier stage of this study. This model will be further used to examine magnetic perturbations at an earlier stage of dust cloud acceleration, and then\ndetermine the size, density, and total mass of dust cloud, as well as its creation and acceleration.",

The perspicacity of these interactions is critical for advancing water resources management. This study discusses an approach that entails an entropy-based spatio-temporal disorder index. The index seems suitable for analyzing joint features and is hence applicable to these interactions at the watershed scale. The approach examines the joint spatio-temporal patterns of streamflow, precipitation, and land-cover across the watershed. Indeed, these three variables play a determinant role in terrestrial hydrology and are time dependent with meaningful spatial heterogeneity.

            "abstract": "More than 20 active volcanoes with historical eruptions are known on 17 islands composing the Central and Northern part of the Kurilian Arc. Six islands – Paramushir, Shiashkotan, Rasshua, Ushishir, Ketoy and Simushir – are characterized by hydrothermal activity, complementary to the fumarolic activity in their craters. There are several types of volcano-hydrothermal systems on the islands. At Paramushir, Shiashkotan and Ketoy the thermal manifestations are acidic to ultra-acidic water discharges associated with hydrothermal aquifers inside volcano edifices and formed as the result of the absorption of magmatic gases by ground waters. A closest known analogue of such activity is Satsuma-Iwojima volcano-island at the Ryukyu Arc. Another type of hydrothermal activity are wide spread coastal hot springs (Shiashkotan, Rasshua), situated as a rule within tide zones and formed by mixing of the heated seawater with cold groundwater or, in opposite, by mixing of the steam- or conductively heated groundwater with seawater. This type of thermal manifestation is similar to that reported for other volcanic islands of the world (Satsuma Iwojima, Monserrat, Ischia, Socorro). Ushishir volcano-hydrothermal system is formed by the absorption of magmatic gases by seawater. Only Ketoy Island hosts a permanent acidic crater lake. At Ebeko volcano (Paramushir) rapidly disappearing small acidic lakes (formed after phreatic eruptions) have been reported. The main hydrothermal manifestation of Simushir is the Zavaritsky caldera lake with numerous coastal thermal springs and weak steam vents. The last time measured temperatures of fumaroles at the islands are: >500ºC at Pallas Peak (Ketoy), 480ºC at Kuntamintar volcano (Shiashkotan), variable and fast changing temperatures from 120º C to 500ºC at Ebeko volcano (Paramushir), 150ºC in the Rasshua crater, and > 300ºC in the Chirpoy crater (Black Brothers islands).

These massive rivers transport large fluxes of water and nutrients into the Bay of Bengal via the GBM Delta system in Bangladesh. Future climate change will impact these fluxes with changing rainfall, temperature, evapotranspiration and soil moisture deficits being altered in the catchment systems. In this study the INCA model has been used to assess potential impacts of climate change using the UK Met Office Hadley Centre GCM model linked to a regionally coupled model of South East Asia, covering India and Bangladesh.\nThe Hadley Centre model has been pururbed by varying the parameters in the model to generate 17 realisations of future climates. Some of these reflect expected change but others capture the more extreme potential behaviour of future climate conditions. The 17 realisations have been used to drive the INCA Flow and Nitrogen model inorder to generate downstream times series of hydrology and nitrate- nitrogen. The variability of the climates on these fluxes are investigated and and their likley impact on the Bay of Begal Delta considered. Results indicate a slight shift in the monsoon season with increased wet season flows and increased temperatures which alter nutrient fluxes.\nSocietal Importance to Stakeholders\nThe GBM Delta supports one of the most densely populated regions of people living in poverty, who rely on ecosystem services provided by the Delta for survival. These ecosystem services are dependent upon fluxes of water and nutrients. Freshwater for urban, agriculture, and aquaculture requirements are essential to livelihoods. Nutrient loads stimulate estuarine ecosystems, supporting fishing stocks, which contribute significantly the economy of Bangladesh. Thus the societal importance of upstream climate driven change change in Bangladesh are very significant to many stakeholders in Bangladesh at the local, regional and national levels.",

            "abstract": "Norovirus is a highly infectious virus and the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks such as oyster norovirus outbreaks. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent norovirus infection and no drug to treat it. This paper presents an integrated modeling and mapping framework for predicting the risk of norovirus outbreaks in oyster harvesting waters in the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The framework involves (1) the construction of three novel remote sensing algorithms for the retrieval of sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature, and gage height (tide level) using NASA MODIS Aqua data; (2) the development of probability-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for the prediction of oyster norovirus outbreak risk, and (3) the application of the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) for mapping norovirus outbreak risks in oyster harvesting areas in the Northern Gulf of Mexico using the remotely sensed NASA data, retrieved data from the three remote sensing algorithms, and the ANN model predictions. The three remote sensing algorithms are able to correctly retrieve 94.1% of sea surface salinity, 94.0% of sea surface temperature, and 77.8% of gage height observed along the US coast, including the Pacific coast, the Gulf of Mexico coast, and the Atlantic coast. The gage height, temperature, and salinity are the three most important explanatory variables of the ANN model in terms of spatially distributed input variables. The ANN model is capable of hindcasting/predicting all oyster norovirus outbreaks occurred in oyster growing areas along the Gulf of Mexico coast where environmental data are available. The integrated modeling and mapping framework makes it possible to map daily risks of norovirus outbreaks in all oyster harvesting waters and particularly the oyster growing areas where no in-situ environmental data are available, greatly improving the safety of seafood and reducing outbreaks of foodborne disease.",

            "abstract": "Dust devils are significant agents of dust-lifting on Mars, but their importance on Earth has been debated. Accurate quantification of the amount of dust-lifting by devils on Earth requires an understanding of the population of devils (i.e. the formation rate of devils of different diameters as a function of meteorological conditions, their longevity and their dust-lifting intensity). Correlation among these parameters (e.g. large devils last longer) means great care must be taken in evaluating the population integral - the contribution of 'average' devils may be dwarfed by the few largest ones, but large area-time surveys are needed to detect the rare giants. Significant progress has been made in quantifying the vortex population in the field using new pressure-logging instrumentation to generate robust statistics which appear also consistent with Large Eddy Simulations, and the vortex population can be reconciled with visual dust devil counts using Monte Carlo modeling, where core pressure drop is a useful intensity metric, and a threshold of about 0.3 hPa corresponds to visible dust lifting.\nFurther field measurements are exploring the parameter correlation, and vortex model-fitting is being use to estimate diameter and core pressure drop by combining pressure and wind speed/direction data at a single station, a technique that may be useful in the upcoming InSight mission at Mars, where dust devils may be a useful seismic source to probe the near-surface regolith structure. Array measurements with multiple stations are also yielding powerful results.\nThe core pressure drop can also be related to the weight-loading of structures for the quantification of dust devils as a hazard. In fact, dust devils are responsible for a number of deaths on the ground (in addition to aircraft and parachuting accidents) which will be briefly reviewed.",

In this study, we examined two seasonal water balance models as part of a mechanistic approach to reconstruct streamflow with proxy inputs of precipitation and air temperature: a Thornthwaite water balance model modified to operate on a seasonal time step, and a simple water balance model with a snow component. Both models were fit using PRISM and proxy seasonal temperature and precipitation, and their ability to reconstruct streamflow was evaluated for the upper reaches of the West Walker River basin at Coleville, CA. In addition to calibrating both models with a shuffled complex evolution approach, sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate parameter uncertainty. Because the modified Thornthwaite model performed best during calibration (R2 values of 0.96 and 0.80 using PRISM and proxy inputs, respectively), it was then used to reconstruct streamflow during AD 1500-1980 for the target basin. In addition to producing similar wet and dry episodes as other regression-based reconstructions for the Great Basin, our mechanistic approach allowed for estimating actual evapotranspiration and April 1 snow water equivalence in addition to streamflow. This study shows that mechanistic models that can operate with limited input requirements provide options for proxy-based extensions of hydroclimate records in areas with limited instrumental records, and help characterize non-climatic reasons for streamflow variability during the reconstruction period.",

Land subsidence is the surface expression of deformation occurring at depth that is observed with dense, detailed, and high precision interferometric SAR data. In earlier work, Miller & Shirzaei [2015] identified zones of subsidence and uplift across the Phoenix valley caused by pumping and artificial recharge operations. we combined ascending and descending Envisat InSAR datasets to estimate vertical and horizontal displacement time series from 2003-2010. Next, wavelet decomposition was used to extract and compare the elastic components of vertical deformation and hydraulic head data to estimate aquifer storage coefficients. In the following, we present the results from elastic aquifer modeling using a 3D array of triangular dislocations, extending from depth of 0.5 to 3.5 km. We employ a time-dependent modeling scheme to invert the InSAR displacement time series, solving for the spatiotemporal distribution of the aquifer-aquitard compaction. Such models are used to calculate strain and stress fields and forecast the location of extensional cracks and earth fissures, useful for urban planning and management. Later, applying the framework suggested by Burbey [1999], the optimum compaction model is used to estimate the 3D distribution of hydraulic conductivities as a function of time. These estimates are verified using in-situ and laboratory observations and provide unique evidence to investigate the stress-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity and its variations due to pumping, recharge, and injection. The estimates will also be used in groundwater flow models, enhancing water management in the valley and elsewhere. <span\">",

            "abstract": "The seismic signal generated by rockfalls, landslides or avalanches provides an unique tool to detect, characterize and monitor gravitational flow activity, with strong implication in terms of natural hazards. Indeed, as natural flows travel down the slope, they apply stresses on top of the Earth surface, generating seismic waves in a wide frequency band, associated to the different physical processes involved. Our aim is to deduce the granular flow properties from the generated signal. It is addressed here with both laboratory experiments and simulations. In practice, regarding the experimental part, a set-up using a combination of optical and acoustic methods is employed, in order to measure the seismic signal generated by, (i) the impact of beads of different properties, (ii) the collapse of granular columns, over horizontal and sloping substrates. The substrates are made of plates and blocs of different sizes and characteristics. For the first point (i), Farin et al. [2015] have showed that it exists a link between the properties of an impacting bead (mass and velocity) on smooth surfaces and the emitted signal (radiated elastic energy and mean frequency). This demonstrate that it is possible to deduce the impactor properties thanks to the emitted signal. We show here that it is slightly different for rough and erodible surfaces, because of more dissipative processes engaged (friction, grain reorganization, etc). The point (ii) is different from multiple single impacts. We compare experimental situation to a Discrete Elements Method simulation developed by Patrick Richard (IFSTTAR). It computes trajectories of each particle of a granular column collapses, using collisions forces from simplified Hertz's contact model (spring + dashpot) and Verlet's algorithm. We used it to compute synthetic signal generated by the impacts. If the dynamics of beads is well reproduced, waves are different, confirming that “more is different”.",

It also serves as a benchmark for the less developed regions of China, in terms of achieving the developed world's human development standard under lower per capita emissions. We analyze the driving forces of emissions in this region and their provincial characteristics by applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. Our findings show that emissions have been doubled during the period from 2000 to 2012, along with three and two folds increase in economy and energy consumption, respectively. This suggests a persistent lock between economic growth and emissions, even in this socioeconomically advanced region in China. Provincial difference in annual emission growth reveals three distinguished low-carbon developmental stages, owning mainly to the effectiveness of energy efficiency in reducing emission growth. This may explain why previous climate policies have aimed to reduce carbon intensity. These results indicate that targeted measures on enhancing energy efficiency in the short term and de-carbonization of both the economic and energy structure in the long term can lower the emission growth more effectively and efficiently. They also suggest that factor-driven emission reduction strategies and policies are needed in the geographically and socioeconomically similar regions.",

            "abstract": "In order to better understand the mechanics of seismogenesis and stress state along subduction plate boundaries, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) program has focused on drilling a transect of boreholes across the subduction zone offshore SW Japan to collect core samples and geophysical logs. One primary target of the drilling effort is a major splay fault (the “megasplay”) that branches from the décollement ~55 km landward of the trench and reaches the seafloor ~30 km from the trench. Three drillsites near the tip of the megasplay sampled the same 1.24-1.65 Ma slope apron sediment section at a reference location 0.75 km seaward of the megasplay fault tip (Site C0008), at the fault tip (Site C0022), and 0.30 km landward (Site C0004) where the section is overridden by accretionary prism sediment. We report on a suite of laboratory experiments conducted on coeval core samples from the three sites, to test the hypothesis that increasing horizontal stress with proximity to the megasplay fault leads to overconsolidation.\nWe conducted uniaxial constant rate of strain (CRS) and triaxial consolidation experiments to define consolidation state and yield behavior of the sediment, and to estimate in situ effective stress magnitudes. The consolidation state is described in terms of the over-consolidation ratio (OCR), which is the ratio of stress at yield in the experiments to the in situ vertical stress expected for normal consolidation. Values of OCR increase with proximity to the fault, with values ranging from 0.5-1 at the reference Site C0008, to 1.4-1.5 at Site C0022 at the tip of the fault, to 1.7-2.1 in the footwall of the fault at Site C0004, defining a trend of progressively increasing overconsolidation. We attribute this pattern to increasing horizontal stress as the megasplay fault is approached. Assuming that the sediment is at a critical state (i.e. on the verge of shear failure) at the tip of the fault, we estimate that the maximum horizontal effective stress is 4.4 MPa at a depth of 94.5 m below seafloor at Site C0022, where the effective vertical stress is 0.62 MPa. Our result is consistent with analyses of borehole breakouts at Site C0004 that define a thrust faulting regime, and may help constrain future faulting and earthquake models near the megasplay fault.",

            "abstract": "Event magnitude and area scaling relationships for rainfall over different regions of the world, have been presented in the literature for relatively short durations and over relatively small areas. In this paper, we present the first ever results on a global analysis of the scaling characteristics of extreme rainfall areas for durations ranging from 1 to 30 days. Broken power law models are fit in each case. The past work has been focused largely on the time and space scales associated with local and regional convection. The work presented here suggests that power law scaling may also apply to planetary scale phenomenon, such as frontal and monsoonal systems, and their interaction with local moisture recycling. Such features may have persistence over large areas corresponding to extreme rain and regional flood events. As a result they lead to considerable hazard exposure. A caveat is that methods used for empirical power law identification have difficulties with edge effects due to finite domains. This leads to problems with robust model identification and interpretability of the underlying relationships. We use recent algorithms that aim to address some of these issues in a principled way. Theoretical research that could explain why such results may emerge across the world, as analyzed for the first time in this paper, is needed.",

There is limited knowledge of hydrological and geochemical changes that result from a fire over a karst system. Soil science literature has shown that fire can change surface properties and from this it has been hypothesized that these impacts will be mirrored in an underlying cave (see Figure). This project is the first phase of a pre/post-fire study of organic matter, drip rates, trace metal composition, and stable isotope composition changes in a semi-arid cave system.\nThis project aims establishes the baseline hydrogeochemical processes at Wildman’s cave, at Wombeyan in NSW, Australia. The Wildman’s cave site has not been studied previously, so this study adds to expanding literature on cave systems. This pre-fire monitoring provides a new dataset for semiarid karst processes.\nWe report the first 8 months of an ongoing dataset, obtained through collection of dripwater samples, with drip loggers indicating drip rates over the same period. Dripwaters were analysed for pH and EC, cation/anion content, organic matter content and stable isotope composition. Following the successful completion of this baseline study, post fire data will be obtained via a controlled burn. This will expand on current knowledge of the use of speleothems as accurate records of past climates and fire history.",

            "abstract": "Climatic cooling and expansion of Antarctic ice sheets was accompanied by a global reorganization in ocean circulation during the early Oligocene. Such a change in the ocean-climate system is expected to alter the pelagic ecosystem through elevated rates of extinction and increased biogeographic provincialism. A well documented, but poorly understood, example of this provincialism is the recurrence of unusual chalks composed of the nannofossil genus Braarudosphaera across the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean. Here we present preliminary findings from a study of the paleoceanographic conditions that fostered these Braarudosphaera “blooms” at Deep Sea Drilling Site 516 (Rio Grande Rise, southwestern Atlantic). Within the early Oligocene stratigraphy at this site, there are four chalky (recrystallized) layers in which braarudosphaerids compose ~70% of the nannofossil assemblages. Astronomical tuning was performed on conventional benthic foraminiferal δ18O and δ13C records encompassing the four layers to determine the timing of their recurrence. A strong astronomical rhythm is preserved with the blooms occurring during nodes in the theoretical obliquity solution. In addition, planktic foraminiferal stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) records were generated for the study section using both secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and conventional gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The SIMS-based δ13C record for the thermocline-dwelling genus Catapsydrax registers substantial (~1.5‰) decreases during the blooms, signaling pulsed increases in the upwelling of 13C-depleted waters. By contrast, the IRMS-based δ13C record for this same genus show no appreciable change in hydrographic conditions during the blooms. We attribute the invariant nature of the IRMS-based δ13C record to the smoothing effects of diagenesis. These results demonstrate how marine plankton respond to changing oceanographic conditions driven by astronomical forcing of ice-sheet dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Monthly ERA interim reanalysis data are analyzed via CSEOF analysis to understand the mechanism of sea ice melting in the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic amplification. While sea ice melting is widespread over much of the perimeter of the Arctic Ocean in summer, sea ice remains to be thin in winter only in the Barents and Kara (BK) Seas. Excessive turbulent heat flux through sea surface exposed to air due to sea ice melting warms the atmospheric column. Warmer air increases downward longwave radiation, which ultimately increases surface air temperature and leads to further sea ice melting. This mechanism is not clearly observed in the Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort (LECB) Seas, since sea ice refreezes in late fall (November) before excessive turbulent heat flux is available for warming the atmospheric column in winter. Detailed seasonal heat budget is presented in order to understand specific differences between the BK and LECB regions. The positive feedback in the BK is estimated to accelerate at the rate of ~8% per year. Sea ice is expected to disappear in the BK by around 2025.",

            "abstract": "The horizontal Nazca slab, extending over a distance of ~800 km along the trench is one of enigmatic features in Peruvian subduction zone. Increased buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere alone due to the subduction of Nazca Ridge is insufficient to fully explain such a lengthy segment. We use data from the recent seismic experiment in southern Peru to find that the subduction-related hydration plays a major role in controlling shear wave velocities within the upper part of the oceanic crust and overlying materials. We observe substantial velocity reductions of ~20-40% near the top plate interface along- and perpendicular-to the trench from ~40-120 km depths. In particular, significant shear wave velocity reductions and subsequently higher P-to-S velocity ratio (exceeding 2.0) at the flat slab region suggest that the seismically probed layer is fluid-rich and mechanically weak. The dominant source of fluid comes from metasediments and subducted crust (Nazca Ridge). Long-term supply of fluid from the southward migrating Nazca Ridge provides additional buoyancy of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and also lowers the viscosity of the overlying mantle wedge to drive and sustain the flat plate segment of ~800 km along the trench. Also, by comparing calculated seismic velocities with experimentally derived mineral physics data, we additionally provide mechanical constraints on the possible changes in frictional behavior across the subduction zone plate interface. Observed low seismic velocities in the seismogenic zone suggest a presence of low strength materials that may be explained by overpressured pore fluids (i.e., accreted sediment included in the subduction channel).",

Instead of looking at the first two moment statistics, mean and standard deviation, the performance of the CMIP5 models in reproducing the physical evolutions in the GPCP data by employing cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis. Each CSEOF loading vector (CSLV) and corresponding principal component (PC) time series derived from individual CMIP5 models are compared with those of the GPCP data for the first 10 modes. Only the first CSEOF mode (the seasonal cycle) was simulated with a reasonable accuracy; the average pattern correlation is 0.675 (0.446-0.764) and the average temporal correlation is 0.999 (0.997-0.999). The performance of the model quickly diminishes as the mode number increases, with the best pattern correlation less than 0.2 for modes higher than 4.\nIn an effort to improve the CMIP5 precipitation data for practical uses, optimal weighting scheme is developed in CSEOF space. In this new scheme, optimal weighting is conducted for each physical mode. For validation, the Jackknife method is used by filling a missing year in GPCP data using the 23 CMIP5 model datasets. This procedure is repeated until all of the 23 years are covered. Correlation and RMSE are significantly improved in comparison with those of the best CMIP5 models. A similar experiment is conducted using a conventional optimal weighting at each grid point; the performance of an optimal weighting scheme at each grid point is not better than that of the best CMIP5 models, suggesting that the multi-model optimal ensemble in CSEOF space is much better than that at each grid point.",

            "abstract": "To improve short-term particulate matter (PM) forecasts in South Korea, the initial distribution of PM composition, particularly over the upwind regions, is primarily important. To prepare the initial PM composition, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data retrieved from a geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO) satellite sensor, GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) which covers Northeast Asia (113°E–146°E; 25°N–47°N), were used. A spatio-temporal (ST) kriging method was used to better prepare the initial AOD distributions that were converted into the PM composition over Northeast Asia. One of the largest advantages to using the ST-kriging method in this study is that more observed AOD data can be used to prepare the best initial AOD fields. It is demonstrated in this study that the short-term PM forecast system developed with the application of the ST-kriging method can greatly improve PM10 predictions in Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), when evaluated with ground-based observations. For example, errors and biases of PM10 predictions decreased by ~60% and ~70%, respectively, during the first 6 h of short-term PM forecasting, compared with those without the initial PM composition. In addition, The influences of several factors (such as choices of observation operators and control variables) on the performances of the short-term PM forecast were also explored in this study.",

            "abstract": "Various processes of subduction zone magmatism, such as upward migration of partial melts and fractional crystallization depend on the density of the hydrous silicate melt. The density and the compressibility of the hydrous melt are key factors for the thermodynamic calculation of phase relation of the hydrous melt, and the geophysical inversion to predict physicochemical conditions of the melting region based on the seismic velocity. This study presents a new model for the calculations of the density of the hydrous silicate melts as a function of T, P, H2O content and melt composition.\nThe Birch-Murnaghan equation is used for the equation of state. We compile the experimentally determined densities of various hydrous melts, and optimize the partial molar volume, compressibility, thermal expansibility and its pressure derivative, and K’ of the H2O component in the silicate melt. P-T ranges of the calibration database are 0.48-4.29 GPa and 1033-2073 K. As such, this model covers the P-T ranges of the entire melting region of the subduction zone. Parameter set provided by Lange and Carmichael [1990] is used for the partial molar volume and KT value of the anhydrous silicate melt. K’ of anhydrous melt is newly parameterized as a function of SiO2 content.\nThe new model accurately reproduces the experimentally determined density variations of various hydrous melts from basalt to rhyolite. Our result shows that the hydrous melt is more compressive and less dense than the anhydrous melt; with the 5 wt% of H2O in melt, density and KT decrease by ~10% and ~30% from those of the anhydrous melt, respectively. For the application of the model, we calculated the P-wave velocity of the hydrous melt. With the 5 wt% of H2O, P-wave velocity of the silicate melt decreases by >10%. Based on the melt P-wave velocity, we demonstrate the effect of the melt H2O content on the seismic velocity of the partially molten zone of the subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) recently emerged in the literature as a robust signal in the Northern Hemisphere climate variability. Many studies reported that the relationships between PDO and East Asian monsoon (EAM) and climate variability in China are significant. However, the possible mechanisms are still unclear. The present study investigates the interdecadal relationship between Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and interhemispheric air mass imbalance or oscillation (IHO) between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The possible connection of PDO and IHO with both East Asian monsoon and climate variability in China are also assessed in this study. It is found that the interdecadal components (11-38 years) of PDO, IHO, and EAM contribute large variance to low frequency variations, and they are well-matched with each other on (inter)decadal timescale. In particular, their negative phases mainly appeared in the 1970s and late 1990s, while positive phase in period from 1980s to mid 1990s. Decadal change of global mean air columnar temperature may be the key factor for the notable difference between PDO and IHO from mid 1970s to mid 1990s. The spatial distributions of PDO and IHO associated surface air temperature and surface pressure anomalies exhibit highly similar and large scale characteristics, indicative of their intimate linkage with air mass redistribution over global domain especially over 300S-500N. The PDO associated columnar integral of velocity potential anomalies that maintain the air mass redistribution, show a dipole pattern with air mass flux emanating mainly from the eastern hemisphere to the Pacific regions in positive PDO phase. This contributes to hemispherical and land-sea mass exchange and redistribution, and also leads to the decadal displacement of both upward and downward branch of Walker circulation. In positive phase of PDO, an anomalous anticyclone is found in the Mongolian region in both boreal summer and winter seasons, inducing significant anomalous northerlies in the eastern China, and hence intensifying (weakening) the east Asian winter (summer) monsoon. Consequently, the interdecadal components of temperature and precipitation at most stations in east China are simultaneously correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation index significantly.",

            "abstract": "The timing of the changma onset has high impacts on the Korean Peninsula, yet its seasonal prediction remains a great challenge because the changma undergoes various influences from the tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes. In this study, a dynamics-based statistical prediction model for the changma onset is proposed. This model utilizes three predictors of slowly varying sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the northern tropical central Pacific, the North Atlantic, and the North Pacific occurring in the preceding spring season. SSTAs associated with each predictor persist until June and have an effect on the changma onset by inducing an anticyclonic anomaly to the southeast of the Korean Peninsula earlier than the climatological changma onset date. The persisting negative SSTAs over the northern tropical central Pacific and accompanying anomalous trade winds induce enhanced convection over the far-western tropical Pacific; in turn, these induce a cyclonic anomaly over the South China Sea and an anticyclonic anomaly southeast of the Korean Peninsula. Diabatic heating and cooling tendency related to the North Atlantic dipolar SSTAs induces downstream Rossby wave propagation in the upper troposphere, developing a barotropic anticyclonic anomaly to the south of the Korean Peninsula. A westerly wind anomaly at around 45°N resulting from the developing positive SSTAs over the North Pacific directly reduces the strength of the Okhotsk high and gives rise to an anticyclonic anomaly southeast of the Korean Peninsula. With the dynamics-based statistical prediction model, it is demonstrated that the changma onset has considerable predictability of r = 0.73 for the period from 1982 to 2014.",

The adaptation of agile software development principles (http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) to data curation processes has significant potential to lower barriers to effective scientific data discovery and reuse - barriers that otherwise may force the development of new data to replace existing but unusable data, or require substantial effort to make data usable in new research contexts. This paper outlines a data curation process that was developed at the University of New Mexico that provides a cross-walk of data and associated documentation between the data archive developed by the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network Office (PASTA - http://lno.lternet.edu/content/network-information-system) and UNM's institutional repository (LoboVault - http://repository.unm.edu). The developed automated workflow enables the replication of versioned data objects and their associated standards-based metadata between the LTER system and LoboVault - providing long-term preservation for those data/metadata packages within LoboVault while maintaining the value-added services that the PASTA platform provides. The relative ease with which this workflow was developed is a product of the capabilities independently developed on both platforms - including the simplicity of providing a well-documented application programming interface (API) for each platform enabling scripted interaction and the use of well-established documentation standards (EML in the case of PASTA, Dublin Core in the case of LoboVault) by both systems. These system characteristics, when combined with an iterative process of interaction between the Data Curation Librarian (on the LoboVault side of the process), the Sevilleta LTER Information Manager and the LTER Network Information System developer, yielded a rapid and relatively streamlined process for targeted replication of data and metadata between the two systems - increasing the discoverability and usability of the LTER data assets.",

            "abstract": "Kuritani et al. (2013, Mineral. Petrol.) and Kuritani et al. (2014, Contrib. Mineral. Petrol.) estimated genetic conditions of primary arc magmas beneath the Iwate volcano (a frontal arc volcano in the northeast Japan arc) and the Sannome-gata volcano (a rear-arc volcano in the northeast Japan arc) based on analyses of volcanic rocks and numerical simulation. They estimated that H2O concentrations of primary melts are 4-5 wt.% beneath the Iwate volcano and 6-7 wt.% beneath the Sannnome-gata volcano, respectively. Their arguments mean that primary melts beneath frontal-arc volcanoes and rear-arc volcanoes are both H2O-rich, yet there has been no direct evidence to support their arguments at the Sannnome-gata volcano because volcanic rocks are either almost aphyric and/or almost no melt inclusions were found.\nHydrogen concentration in nominally anhydrous minerals serves as a hygrometer of arc basaltic melts (e.g., Hamada et al. 2013, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.). In this study, hydrogen concentration of plagioclase as a crustal xenocryst was analyzed to estimate H2O concentration of basaltic melt coexisted with plagioclase before the eruption.\nPlagioclase xenocrists were separated from crushed scoria which erupted from the Sannome-gata volcano 20,000-24,000 years ago. Composition of the plagioclase core is homogeneous and ranges from An30 through An35. The rim is 150 to 200-μm-thick dusty zone whose composition is around An60, suggesting that the rim crystallized rapidly from degassed basaltic melt. The profiles of infrared absorption area per unit thickness across the plagioclase core were obtained using Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometer (FTIR). The inner core contains hydrogen of about 60 wt. ppm H2O, and hydrogen concentration elevates at outer core. Hydrogen concentration at the outermost core of plagioclase is >200 wt. ppm H2O, suggesting that plagioclase xenocrists were taken by hydrous melt (H2O>5 wt.%; Hamada et al. 2014, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.) and hydrogen diffused into plagioclase before the eruption. These analytical results confirms that rear-arc primary magmas are H2O-rich as well as frontal-arc primary magmas at the northeast Japan arc.",

            "abstract": "Despite the severe impact of individual tropical cyclones like Sandy (2012) and Haiyan (2013), global TC activities as a whole have actually dropped considerably since the early 1990’s. Especially over the most active and hazardous TC basin on earth, the Western North Pacific (WNP) typhoon Main Development Region (MDR), an evident decrease in TC activity has been observed, as characterised by the drop in the annual Power Dissipation Index (Emanuel 2005). Paradoxically, this decrease occurred despite evident ocean warming, with upper ocean heat content increased by ~ 12% over the western North Pacific MDR (Pun et al. 2013; Lin et al. 2014). This study explores the interesting interplay between atmosphere and ocean on the WNP typhoons. Though ocean may become more favourable (warming) to fuel individual typhoon event through temporal relaxation in the atmosphere condition (e.g. Haiyan in 2013), the overall ‘worsened’ atmospheric condition (e.g. increase in vertical wind shear) can ‘over-powers’ the ‘better’ ocean to suppress the overall WNP typhoon activities. This stronger negative contribution from reduced typhoon frequency over the increased intensity is also present under the global warming scenario, based on analysis of the simulated typhoon data from high-resolution modelling.",

            "abstract": "Aquifers around the world show troubling signs of irreversible depletion and seawater intrusion as climate change, population growth, and urbanization lead to reduced natural recharge rates and overuse. Scientists and engineers have begun to revisit the technology of managed aquifer recharge and recovery (MAR) as a means to increase the reliability of the diminishing and increasingly variable groundwater supply. Unfortunately, MAR systems remain wrought with operational challenges related to the quality and quantity of recharged and recovered water stemming from a lack of data-driven, real-time control. This research seeks to develop and validate a general simulation-based control optimization algorithm that relies on real-time data collected though embedded sensors that can be used to ease the operational challenges of MAR facilities. Experiments to validate the control algorithm were conducted at the laboratory scale in a two-dimensional synthetic aquifer under both homogeneous and heterogeneous packing configurations. The synthetic aquifer used well characterized technical sands and the electrical conductivity signal of an inorganic conservative tracer as a surrogate measure for water quality. The synthetic aquifer was outfitted with an array of sensors and an autonomous pumping system. Experimental results verified the feasibility of the approach and suggested that the system can improve the operation of MAR facilities. The dynamic parameter inversion reduced the average error between the simulated and observed pressures between 12.5 and 71.4%. The control optimization algorithm ran smoothly and generated optimal control decisions. Overall, results suggest that with some improvements to the inversion and interpolation algorithms, which can be further advanced through testing with laboratory experiments using sensors, the concept can successfully improve the operation of MAR facilities.",

            "abstract": "Polycystine radiolarians, are one of the planktonic microorganisms group, which bear siliceous skeletons. Because their fossils are well preserved in the deep-sea sediments of the North Pacific, numerous studies have been conducted for better understand radiolarian species geographic distributions in this area. It’s appear that radiolarians are very sensitive to sea water ecological changes forced by the climate. On the other hand, the northwestern Pacific is characterized by the flows of the Kuroshio Current, transporting warm and saline water from the tropics and by the Oyashio Current, transporting cold water from the subarctic regions. In this context, we propose in this study to clarify and understand how these currents influence the radiolarian assemblages.\nWe have analyzed 80 surface sediment samples collected by the Geological Survey of Japan, from the Okinawa regions to the Sea of Okhotsk. The samples were treated with H2O2 and HCl and sieved using a 45 μm screen before to be mounted on microscopic slides. We have counted 300 to 600 specimens per samples. Because warm water characterized the Kuroshio Current and cold water characterized the Oyashio Current, in this study we have compared all the relative abundances of the surface dwellers with sea surface temperature (SST) data provided by the World Atlas Ocean 2013. As a major results, the area from the coast off Okinawa Islands to off Bôsô Peninsula, fed by the Kuroshio Current, is characterized by high abundance of Tetrapyle ocatacantha group. This species group high abundances seems to correspond to SST between 20-30℃. Species as Didymocyrtis tetrathalamus present its highest abundances in the Okinawa region to south of Kyushu Island where the SST is between 25-30℃. On the other hand, species as Ceratospyris borealis is abundant in the northern Japan, where the Oyashio Current flows. The high abundance of Ceratospyris borealis seems to correspond to SST between 5-10℃. Based on these new results, an updated transfer function has been developed, in order estimate accurately the past sea surface temperature in the Northwest Pacific, based on radiolarian species.",

            "abstract": "While the land surface latent and sensible heat release in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) could greatly influence the Asian monsoon circulation, the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) information in the TP has been largely hindered by its extremely sparse ground observation network. Thus the complementary relationship (CR) theory lends great potential in estimating the ETa since it relies on solely routine meteorological observations. With the in-situ energy/water flux observation over the highest semiarid alpine steppe in the TP, the modifications of specific components within the CR were first implemented. We found that the symmetry of the CR could be achieved for dry regions of TP when (i) the Priestley-Taylor coefficient, (ii) the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve and (iii) the wind function were locally calibrated by using the ETa observations in wet days, an estimate of the wet surface temperature and the Monin-Obukhov Similarity (MOS) theory, respectively. In this way, the error of the simulated ETa by the symmetric AA model could be decreased to a large extent. Besides, the asymmetric CR was confirmed in TP when the D20 above-ground and/or E601B sunken pan evaporation (Epan) were used as a proxy of the ETp. Thus daily ETa could also be estimated by coupling D20 above-ground and/or E601B sunken pans through CR. Additionally, to overcome the modification of the specific components in the CR, we also evaluated the Nonlinear-CR model and the Morton’s CRAE model. The former does not need the pre-determination of the asymmetry of CR, while the latter does not require the wind speed data as input. We found that both models are also able to simulate the daily ETa well provided their parameter values have been locally calibrated. The sensitivity analysis shows that, if the measured ETa data are absence to calibrate the models’ parameter values, the Nonlinear-CR model may be a particularly good way for estimating ETabecause of its mild sensitivity to the parameter values making possible to employ published parameter values derived under similar climatic and land cover conditions. The CRAE model should also be highlighted in the TP since the special topography make the wind speed data suffer large uncertainties when the advanced geo-statistical method was used to spatially interpolate the point-based meteorological records.",

            "abstract": "Isacks and Stephens [1975] observed a secondary phase with high frequency Lg characteristics that arrived soon after the Sn wave on seismograms generated by events in the West Indies. They concluded that an Sn-to-Lg conversion occurred at the continental margin, where the crust suddenly thickens. A later study on conversion along the continental margin was done by Seber et al. [1993] in Morocco. They noted that historically Morocco has experienced more damage from earthquakes occurring at the Azores-Gibraltar seismic zone (e.g. the M 8.7-9.0 Lisbon earthquake) at distances up to 500-1000 km than from those within the country. They conclude in their study that there are two parallel Sn-to-Sg conversion zones along the coast and interior of Morocco, where Sg is equivalent to Lg at shorter distances. We have seen similar Sn-to-Sg conversions for a M 5.2 event occurring ~1400 km off the Atlantic Coast on Dec. 23, 2013 using EarthScope’s Transportable Array (TA). We perform a travel time back-projection based on the geometry of the raypaths, similar to Seber et al. [1993], to determine the location of the conversion points for several Atlantic events and compare with seismograms generated by continental events. We also investigate the possibility of a second conversion at the crustal boundary between the Appalachians and the Coastal Plain. The MAGIC Array is used in tandem with TA to closely observe the propagation characteristics of the converted wave as it travels through the continent. With the sizeable increase in station coverage we are in a position to study this conversion in greater detail. Understanding the causes of Sn-to-Sg conversion and the conditions needed to produce it can lead to insight into the geometry and characteristics of the continental shelf and inland crustal boundaries. Learning about this conversion is also needed to determine seismic hazard along coastal areas, where high amplitude converted shear waves can cause unexpected levels of damage.",

            "abstract": "The logging evaluation of tuffaceous sandstone reservoirs is always a difficult problem. Experiments show that the tuff and shale have different logging responses. Since the tuff content exerts an influence on the computation of shale content and the parameters of the reservoir, and the accuracy of saturation evaluation is reduced. Therefore, the effect of tuff on the calculation of saturation cannot be ignored. This study takes the tuffaceous sandstone reservoirs in the X depression of Hailar-Tamtsag basin as an example to analyze. And the electric conduction model of tuffaceous sandstone reservoirs is established. The method which combines bacterial foraging algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to calculate the content of reservoir components in well logging for the first time, and the calculated content of tuff and shale corresponds to the results analysis of thin sections. The experiment on cation exchange capacity (CEC) proves that tuff has conductivity, and the conversion relationship between CEC and resistivity proposed by Toshinobu Iton has been improved. According to the rock electric experiment under simulated reservoir conditions, the rock-electro parameters (a, b, m and n) are determined. The improved relationship between CEC and resistivity and the rock-electro parameters are used in the calculation of saturation. Formula (1) shows the saturation equation of the tuffaceous reservoirs:According to the comparative analysis between irreducible water saturation and the calculated saturation, we find that the saturation equation used CEC data and rock-electro parameters has a better application effect at oil layer than Archie’s formulas.",

            "abstract": "Many GPS stations in Alaska have apparent seasonal variations with amplitudes between 5 and 10mm. This motion is usually in phase with regional snowfall and has been attributed to hydrological loading (Fu et al. 2012). We studied the phase of vertical seasonal motion for fifty stations in the PBO network across Alaska and Washington State and found six stations which move two to four months out of phase with snowfall with amplitudes greater than 4mm. The mean date at which stations’ seasonal movement reached peak height was October 21 with a standard deviation of 49.7 days. 59% of this variation is created by the six stations with phases furthest from the mean. These stations are also distinguished by discontinuous winter movements, including jumps of more than 10mm/day, and they have the six most asymmetric time-series in the study. Three of these stations, AB11, AB12, and AB14, are local high points on Alaska’s west coast. These locations have high wind speeds and humidity and we expect that in freezing conditions they accumulate thick frost and rime. This hypothesis is supported by multipath values at the sites, which show increased signal scattering during the winter.\nWe modelled signal delays for partially ice-covered GPS stations, and predicted that asymmetric horizontal ice growth will cause apparent vertical motion of GPS stations with a magnitude determined by ice thickness and orientation. Rime grows horizontally into the wind, so we estimated rime directions using wind records from nearby airports. We compared these results to our simulation, and predicted upwards apparent motion for the stations that was consistent with the stations’ observed winter movement. The apparent vertical seasonal motion of these stations is not caused by loads but is an artefact of signal delay from ice accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Tallgrass prairie is an important ecosystem type and a major feed for beef cattle in the Southern Great Plains (SGP: Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas). Frequent drought in the SGP affects the production of tallgrass prairie and ultimately the beef cattle production. It is, therefore, necessary to map drought vulnerable areas to help ranchers adapt cattle industry to drought conditions. In this study, we analyzed Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) calculated from near infrared and shortwave infrared bands of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and quantified the spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural drought in the tallgrass prairie region of the SGP during 2000-2013. The number of days with LSWI < 0 during the thermal growing season (start and end dates as well as duration of land surface temperature > 5 °C) was defined as the duration of drought to generate drought duration maps for each year. Following the decreasing rainfall gradient from east to west in the SGP, counties in the west experienced whole growing season drought (WGSZ) more (three or more out of 14 years with WGSD), middle counties had one to two months summer drought, and eastern counties experienced less drought (mainly one year with WGSD and less than one month of summer drought). The LSWI-based drought duration map showed similar patterns with Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) and U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) in wet, summer drought, and whole growing season drought years. Our drought map has identified the vulnerability of counties to different droughts (summer drought and whole growing season drought) in the SGP. This finer resolution (500 m) drought map has the potential to show the drought condition for individual ranch, which can be used to guide drought mitigation activities and livestock production.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, seismic rock physics has played an important role in oil and gas exploration. The seismic rock physics model can quantitatively describe the reservoir characteristics, such as lithologic association, pore structure, geological processes and so on. But the classic rock physics models need to determine the background parameter, that is, matrix mineral bulk modulus. An inaccurate inputs greatly influence the prediction reliability. By introducing different rock physics parameters, Gassmann equation is used to derive a reasonable modification. Two forms of Matrix mineral bulk modulus inversion methods including the linear regression method and Self-adapting inversion method are proposed. They effectively solve the value issues of Matrix mineral bulk modulus in different complex parameters conditions. Based on laboratory tests data, compared with the conventional method, the linear regression method is more simple and accurate. Meanwhile Self-adapting inversion method also has higher precision in the known rich rock physics parameters. Consequently, the modulus value was applied to reservoir fluid substitution, porosity inversion and S-wave velocity prediction. The introduction of Matrix mineral modulus base on Gassmann equations can effectively improve the reliability of the fluid impact prediction, and computational efficiency.",

The recovery efficiency (RE) is regarded as the key criteria for evaluating the ASR performance. In this study, a particular ASR scheme with the fully-penetrating well (FPW) for injection and the partially-penetrating well (PPW) for recovery is proposed to improve the RE for ASR schemes implemented in brackish aquifers. This design appreciates the tilting shape of the interface with underlying heavier salt water. For the FPW, recovery has to be terminated as soon as the interface toe reaches the well, while the toe can be pulled up to the PPW for recovery termination, resulting in later breakthrough of salt water into the pumping well, more recoverable water extracted from the shallow layers, and a higher RE. Key hydrogeological and operational parameters affecting the RE were investigated by numerical simulations. Results demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the new ASR scheme and provided practical guidance for designing such a scheme in various hydrogeological conditions.",

            "abstract": "Using a brightness-based beamforming approach coupled with a matched-filter correlation method, we have developed a 6.5 year record of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) occuring on and near the deep extent of New Zealand's Alpine Fault. Our brightness template detection method, based on that of Frank et al. (2014), scans a pre-determined grid of possible seismic sources to automatically find LFE templates based on the stack of bandpassed squared seismic data. Previous work (Wech et al., 2012, Chamberlain et al., 2014) has shown that the depths of standard seismicity are anti-correlated with those of tremor and LFEs in the central Southern Alps: hence, by careful grid selection, shallow seismic sources can effectively be discriminated against. This beamforming approach produces many (>900) possible events. Initial beamforming detections are grouped by moveout and stacked to produce a subset of higher-quality events for use as templates in a cross-correlation detector. Events detected by cross-correlation are stacked to increase their signal-to-noise charectaristics before being located using a 3D velocity model. This method produces a spatially and temporally continuous catalogue of LFEs throughout the 6.5 year study period. The catalogue highlights quasi-continuous slow deformation occuring beneath the seismogenic zone near the Alpine Fault, punctuated by periods of increased LFE generation associated with tremor, and following large regional earthquakes. To date we have found no evidence of LFE generation north-east of Mt. Cook, the highest point in the Southern Alps, despite systematic searching throughout the region. We suggest that the along-strike cessation of tremor is due to changes in the fault's dip and the hypothesised presence of partially subducted passive margin material. This remnant passive margin would lie benath the tremor-generating region and has been linked to along-strike changes in subcrustal earthquake distributions (Boese et al., 2013).",

            "abstract": "Previous modeling and observational studies have shown that the biophysical impact of deforestation is warming in the tropics and cooling in extra-tropics. In this study, we performed experiments with an earth system model to investigate how deforestation at various spatial scales affects ground temperature, with emphasis on the latitudinal temperature response and the underlining mechanisms. Results show that the latitudinal pattern of temperature response non-linearly depends on the spatial extent of deforestation and the fraction of vegetation change. Compared with regional deforestation, temperature change in global deforestation is greatly amplified in temperate and boreal regions, but is dampened in tropical region. Incremental forest removal fraction leads to increasingly larger cooling under higher removal fraction in temperate and boreal regions, while the temperature increase saturates in tropical region. The latitudinal and spatial patterns of the temperature response are mainly determined by two processes with competing temperature effects, i.e., decreases in absorbed shortwave radiation and in evapotranspiration (ET). These changes in surface energy balance reflect the important role of background climate on modifying the deforestation impact, because shortwave radiation and precipitation have intrinsic geographical distribution, which constrain the effects of biophysical changes and therefore lead to spatially varying temperature change. For example, wet (dry) climate favors larger (smaller) ET change, thus warming (cooling) is more likely to occur. Further analysis on the contribution of individual biophysical factor (albedo, roughness, and evapotranspiration efficiency) reveals that the latitudinal signature embodied in the temperature change likely arises from background climate conditions rather than from the initial biophysical perturbation.",

            "abstract": "This letter presents an analysis of the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on typhoon, with Usagi as an example, using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Three simulations (CTL, CLEAN, EXTREME) were designed according to the emission intensity of anthropogenic pollution. The results showed that although anthropogenic pollution did not have a clear influence on typhoon track and strength, it clearly changed precipitation, the distribution of water hydrometeors, and microphysical processes. In the CLEAN experiment, precipitation rate declined because of cloud water collected by rain decreased. Similarly, precipitation rate decreased in the EXTREME experiment, because cloud water auto-conversion to rain water was restrained. Regarding precipitation type, stratiform precipitation rate in the CLEAN and EXTREME simulations was suppressed because the ice phase microphysical processes weakened. Compared to CTL run, stratiform precipitation rate at the periphery was reduced by about 28% in CLEAN and EXTREME simulations. Moreover, convective precipitation rate annulus 140-160km in EXTREME experiment was about 33% larger than that in CTL simulation. It was triggered new convection at the periphery in EXTREME simulation due to cloud water re-evaporation. Finally, compared to the CTL experiment, rainfall peaks of convective and mixed precipitation type in the CLEAN and EXTREME experiments shifted 10km toward the typhoon periphery.",

This app was developed together with the Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems (FAIMS) at Macquarie University and is based on the open source FAIMS mobile platform, which was originally designed for archaeological field data collection. The FAIMS mobile platform has proved valuable for hydrogeochemical, biogeochemical, soil and rock sample collection due to the ability to customise data collection methodologies for any field research.\nThe module we commissioned allows for using inbuilt or external GPS to locate sample points, it incorporates standard and incremental sampling names which can be easily fed into the International Geo-Sample Number (IGSN). Sampling can be documented not only in metadata, but also accompanied by photographic documentation and sketches. The module is augmented by dropdown menus for fields specific for each sample type and user defined tags. The module also provides users with an overview of all records from a field campaign in a records viewer. We also use basic mapping functionality, showing the current location, sampled points overlaid on preloaded rasters, and allows for drawing of points and simple polygons to be later exported as shape files.\nA particular challenge is the remoteness of the sampling locations, hundreds of kilometres away from network access. The first trial raised the issue of backup without access to the internet, so in collaboration with the FAIMS team and Solutions First, we commissioned a vehicle mounted portable server. This server box is constantly syncing with the tablets in the field via Wi-Fi, it has an uninterruptible power supply that can run for up to 45 minutes when the vehicle is turned off, and a 1TB hard drive for storage of all data and photographs. The server can be logged into via any of the field tablets or laptop to download all the data collected to date or to just view it on the server.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon (14C) is produced by the cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere and is utilized for reconstructing the past solar activity using tree rings. This 14C production is also controlled by the geomagnetic field, and the short-term (at the ~ 10-100 yr duration) movement of the geomagnetic pole to the low latitude, like geomagnetic jerks, might leads to a higher 14C production rate. In order to reconstruct the past solar activity from the 14C concentration, we should know the movement of geomagnetic pole position and the field intensity in a decadal to centennial time series. Previous reconstructions of geomagnetic paleosecular variation lack to reconstruct the short-term variation of geomagnetic field in a decadal or centennial scale. Annual banded skeletons of hermatipic corals (e.g., Porites) might possess an enormous potential as a high-resolution paleomagnetic recorder due to their continuous growths through hundreds of years at a rapid rate (up to 2 cm/yr), although usual corals show an extremely weak intensity of remanence and its low stability. Here we found that recently-ceased Porites coral skeletons thrown up on beach of the Ishigaki Island (SW Japan) possess measurable natural remanence intensities and conducted thermal and AF demagnetization of coral skeletons. The characteristic remanence directions of almost all samples are relatively stable with some fluctuations. However, some samples exhibit obviously different remanence directions from its average with calcite peaks of X-ray diffraction analysis. It is indicated that the magnetic mineral assemblage consists of a dominant biogenic-origin single-domain magnetite and a minor detrital component from FORC measurement, FMR measurement and petrological observations by FE-SEM of acid-treated residuals of our corals. Our findings suggest that Porites coral framework samples have a potential use as a high-resolution paleomagnetic recorder with careful examination of calcite content.",

            "abstract": "Current global chemical transport models are limited by horizontal resolutions (100-500 km), and they cannot capture small-scale processes affecting tropospheric ozone (O3). Here we use a recently built two-way coupling system of GEOS-Chem to simulate the global tropospheric O3 in 2009. The system couples the global model (~ 200 km) and its three nested models (~ 50 km) covering Asia, North America and Europe, respectively. Benefiting from the high resolution, the nested models better capture small-scale processes than the global model alone. In the coupling system, the nested models provide results to modify the global model simulation within respective nested domains while taking the lateral boundary conditions from the global model.\nDue to the \"coupling\" effects, the two-way system significantly improves the tropospheric O3 simulation upon the global model alone, as found by comparisons with a suite of ground (1420 sites from WDCGG, GMD, EMEP, and AQS), aircraft (HIPPO and MOZAIC), and satellite measurements (two OMI products). Compared to the global model alone, the two-way coupled simulation enhances the correlation in day-to-day variation of afternoon mean O3 with the ground measurements from 0.53 to 0.68 and reduces the mean model bias from 10.8 to 6.7 ppb. Regionally, the coupled model reduces the bias by 4.6 ppb over Europe, 3.9 ppb over North America, and 3.1 ppb over other regions. The two-way coupling brings O3 vertical profiles much closer to the HIPPO and MOZAIC data, reducing the tropospheric (0–9 km) mean bias by 3–10 ppb at most MOZAIC sites and by 5.3 ppb for HIPPO profiles. The two-way coupled simulation also reduces the global tropospheric column ozone by 3.0 DU (9.5%), bringing them closer to the OMI data in all seasons. Simulation improvements are more significant in the northern hemisphere, and are primarily a result of improved representation of the nonlinear ozone chemistry, including but not limited to urban-rural contrast.\nThe two-way coupled simulation also reduces the global tropospheric mean hydroxyl radical by 5% with enhancements by 5% in lifetimes of methyl chloroform and methane, bringing them closer to observation-based estimates. Therefore improving model representations of small-scale processes are a critical step forward to understanding the global tropospheric chemistry.",

In Hawai‘i, where non-native trees have invaded widely, loss of biodiversity and hydrological impacts are major concerns. Improving understanding of the effects of non-native tree invasion on the functioning of Hawaiian forests is important for resource managers, especially under a changing climate. But, the effects of species invasion on water cycling are not well known. We present the results for evapotranspiration (ET) based on a decade of eddy covariance measurements at a native forest site and a forest site invaded by Psidium cattleianum, the most prevalent invasive tree species in Hawai‘i, While mean ET was 4% higher at the native site, when normalized by net radiation, the native site was 7% lower than the invaded site. Sensitivity to available energy was greater for the invaded site and, hence, monthly ET of the invaded site exceeds that of the native site when net radiation is greater than about 120 W m-2. This threshold is slightly lower than the mean net radiation at the invaded site and much lower than mean net radiation in drier areas. Recent historical climate trends and projections of future change suggest drier, sunnier conditions in some areas of Hawai‘i. Significant areas of forest are likely to experience greater reductions in streamflow generation and groundwater recharge due to the effects of invasive trees under a future sunnier climate.",

Archaeologically, these glass beads were more prevalent in eastern and northern Taiwan and were generally believed to be non-native, as well as were brought into Taiwan through the maritime exchange and/or trade activities between Taiwan and Southeast Asia/China since the Neolithic Age. Nevertheless, ancient glass beads have been little studies in Taiwan, aspects of these glass beads are not well detailed. In this work, non-destructive micro-Raman spectroscopy and μXRF are used in combination to examine 56 ancient glass beads excavated from six archaeological sites, eastern Taiwan, to unravel the mineralogical and chemical compositions and to help decipher the raw materials used and the provenance of beads. Micro-Raman measurements indicate the presence of hematite, zincite, siderite, sphalerite, lead tin yellow type II, adularia, chalcedony, anatase, rutite, ankerite, graphite, calcite, etc. Hematite, zincite, siderite, sphalerite, lead tin yellow type II, and rutile were found to be colorants/opacifiers. Among these crystalline phases, lead tin yellow type II was first detected in the ancient glass bead unearthed from Taiwan, which is accordant with results of chemical analysis. The chemical results obtained by μXRF show SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, K2O, MgO, CaO, and PbO as the most abundant oxides. It is found that Na2O, Na2O, K2O, Al2O3, and MgO are the main/minor fluxes.

            "abstract": "Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) is a Class I Airshed designated under the Clean Air Act. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in the Park has been a known problem since weekly measurements of wet deposition of inorganic N began in the 1980s by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP). The addition of N from urban and agriculture emissions along the Colorado Front Range to montane ecosystems degrades air quality/visibility, water quality, and soil pH levels.\nBased on NADP data during summers 1994-2014, wet N deposition at Beaver Meadows in RMNP exhibited a bimodal gamma distribution. In this study, we identified meteorological transport mechanisms for 3 high wet-N deposition events (all events were within the secondary peak of the gamma distribution) using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The NARR was used to identify synoptic-scale influences on the transport; the WRF model was used to analyze the convective transport of pollutants from a concentrated animal feeding operation near Greeley, Colorado, USA. The WRF simulation included a passive tracer from the feeding operation and a convection-permitting horizontal spacing of 4/3 km. The three cases suggest (a) synoptic-scale moisture and flow patterns are important for priming summer transport events and (b) convection plays a vital role in the transport of Front Range pollutants into RMNP.",

            "abstract": "Cyclone Pam (2015) that developed in the southern tropical Pacific in March 2015 caused severe damages over the islands states in the southern Pacific. According to JTWC warning, Cyclone Pam was a category-5 storm and its maximum wind speed reached about 75 m/s. Because the islands of Vanuatu were severely damaged by the cyclone, the quantitative assessment of hazards induced by the cyclone is important in order to mitigate and prevent resulting disasters. In addition, this cyclone is of meteorological interest, because the cyclone developed and evolved from active convection of an MJO signal. This study numerically investigates the evolution and intensification of Cyclone Pam from the transformation of convective populations into a vortical structure with the use of a regional meteorological model, the WRF model. By examining the impacts of the size of the computational domain, the grid spacing, and the cumulus parameterization scheme employed to the simulated cyclone, we have found that the most intense cyclone with the most rapid intensification is reproduced with doubly nested domains at 6- and 2-km horizontal resolutions and without a cumulus parameterization; the simulated cyclone achieved the minimum central pressure of about 890 hPa. Transition processes from convective populations of MJO into a tropical cyclone are investigated. It was found that at the pre-storm stage when no cyclonic storm developed there was a very weak low within active convective areas of the MJO when they pass over the equatorial Pacific. The low generates weak cyclonic convergence off the equator. From the sensitivity experiments, there is a clear difference in the environmental moisture field among the experiments. This result suggests that the MJO provided a sufficient amount of moisture, which positively contribute to the intensification of the tropical cyclone.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrological cycle on the land surface and plays an essential role in hydrological and meteorological processes. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on board the Aqua satellite offered valuable soil moisture data set from June 2002 and October 2011 and has been used in a wide range of applications. However, the AMSR-E sensor stopped operation from 4 October 2011 due to a problem with its antenna. AMSR-E was replaced by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) on the Global Climate Change Observation Mission 1 – Water (GCOM-W1) satellite in May 2012. Assessment of AMSR2 soil moisture retrievals as compared to AMSR-E has not yet been extensively evaluated. This task is critical if AMSR2 soil moisture products are used as a continuous dataset continuing the legacy of AMSR-E. The purpose of this study is to inter-compare AMSR2 and AMSR-E microwave based soil moisture over Australia, mediated by using model-based soil moisture data set to determine statistically similar inter-comparison periods from time periods of the individual sensors. This work use NASA-VUA AMSR2 and AMSR-E based soil moisture products derived by the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and the modelled soil moisture from NASA’s MERRA-L (Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications-Land) re-analysis. The satellite soil moisture products are compared against the MERRA-L using traditional metrics, and the random errors in individual products are estimated using lagged instrumental variable regression analysis. Generally, the results demonstrate that the two satellite-based soil moisture retrievals have reasonable agreement with MERRA-L soil moisture data set. The error differences are notable, with the zonal error statistics are higher for AMSR2 in all climate zones, though the error maps of AMSR2 and AMSR-E are spatially similar over the Australia regions. This study leads to a better understanding of the newly developed AMSR2 soil moisture and thus helps AMSR2 to extend the valuable legacy of AMSR-E predecessor.",

            "abstract": "The paroxysmal eruption of Volcan Villarrica on March 3rd, 2015 produced a moderate-sized lahar, which descended more than 20 km within the Rio Correntoso/Turbio drainage. A three-element infrasound array 10 km from the summit, and 4 km from the lahar’s closest approach, was used to track the flow’s evolution as it progressed downstream. Array processing using cross correlation lag times as well as semblance techniques places important constraints on the lahar’s dynamics, including the detection of an early flow pulse that traveled from 3 to 13 km at an average speed of 36 m/s. After the first six minutes of lahar advancement the signal evolves into a relatively stationary infrasonic tremor located ~11.5 km downstream and consistent with a notch in intervening topography. Diminishing tremor amplitude over the course of more than two hours constrain the flow duration and indicates progressively decreasing flow energy and/or confinement of the flow to more distant reaches. This study demonstrates the powerful capabilities of infrasound arrays for lahar study and suggests its potential implementation for hazard monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Data quality information is essential to facilitate reuse of Earth science data. Recorded quality information must be sufficient for other researchers to select suitable data sets for their analysis and confirm the results and conclusions. In the research data ecosystem, several entities are responsible for data quality. Data producers (researchers and agencies) play a major role in this aspect as they often include validation checks or data cleaning as part of their work. It is possible that the quality information is not supplied with published data sets; if it is available, the descriptions might be incomplete, ambiguous or address specific quality aspects. Data repositories have built infrastructures to share data, but not all of them assess data quality. They normally provide guidelines of documenting quality information. Some suggests that scholarly and data journals should take a role in ensuring data quality by involving reviewers to assess data sets used in articles, and incorporating data quality criteria in the author guidelines. However, this mechanism primarily addresses data sets submitted to journals. We believe that data consumers will complement existing entities to assess and document the quality of published data sets. This has been adopted in crowd-source platforms such as Zooniverse, OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, Mechanical Turk and Tomnod. This paper presents a framework designed based on open source tools to capture and share data users’ feedback on the application and assessment of research data. The framework comprises a browser plug-in, a web service and a data model such that feedback can be easily reported, retrieved and searched. The feedback records are also made available as Linked Data to promote integration with other sources on the Web. Vocabularies from Dublin Core and PROV-O are used to clarify the source and attribution of feedback. The application of the framework is illustrated with the CSIRO’s Data Access Portal.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the deep Black Sea are ~2.5 times higher than found in the global ocean. The two major external sources of DOC are rivers and the Mediterranean, while expansive phytoplankton blooms contribute autochthonous carbon to the Black Sea’s ~800 Tg C DOC reservoir. Here, a basin-wide zonal section of DOC is explored using data from the 2013 Dutch GEOTRACES GA04-N “MedBlack” cruise 64PE373. DOC distributions are interpreted with respect to well-described hydrographic and biogeochemical layers of the Black Sea. DOC concentrations were >180 µmol kg-1 at the surface, decreasing to ~125 µmol kg-1 at the base of the oxic layer and reaching a minimum of ~113 µmol kg-1 in the upper anoxic layer between ~150 and 500 m. Maximum anoxic layer concentrations of 122 µmol kg-1 were found in the homogeneous benthic bottom layer (>1775 m). Determined from the relationship of DOC with salinity, we found that ~34-41 µmol kg-1 was removed from the basin’s oxic layer in <5 years, and an additional 13 ± 5 µmol kg-1 was removed from the anoxic layer during its ~300-600 years residence time, given steady state. We find no evidence for DOC accumulation in the anoxic Black Sea, and suggest that concentrations are elevated relative to the ocean due to input of terrigenous DOC from rivers. The Black Sea’s relatively elevated DOC pool may be analogous to the previously hypothesized anoxic Eocene ocean’s elevated reservoir if the Eocene ocean received a substantial amount of terrigenous DOC from rivers.",

The app has the function to distinguish earthquake shakings from daily human activities based on the different patterns behind the movements. It also can be triggered by the traditional earthquake early warning (EEW) system to record for a certain amount of time to collect earthquake data. When the app is triggered by the earthquake-like movements, it sends the trigger information back to our server which contains time and location of the trigger, at the same time, it stores the waveform data on local phone first, and upload to our server later. Trigger information from multiple phones will be processed in real time on the server to find the coherent signal to confirm the earthquakes. Therefore, the app provides the basis to form a smartphone seismic network that can detect earthquake and even provide warnings. A planned public roll-out of MyShake could collect millions of seismic recordings for large earthquakes in many regions around the world.",

            "abstract": "The M9 Tohoku-Oki earthquake is the best-recorded megathrust earthquake to date. The effects of the strong shaking experienced throughout Japan include a decrease in shear velocity along the volcanic arc and changes in the crustal seismicity patterns. Here, we utilize a total of 181 Hi-Net and F-Net stations from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) to investigate the crustal discontinuity structure in the Tohoku region before and after the earthquake. We calculate P to S receiver functions (PRFs) for ~3400 teleseismic events from 2004 to early 2015. The ~500,000 radial component PRFs are stacked with a common conversion point method to create a new three-dimensional model of the Tohoku region discontinuity structure and to map the Mohorovičić Discontinuity (Moho). The Moho is ~5 km deeper than previous estimates using travel time and local earthquake information, indicating the two estimates correspond, potentially, to the top and bottom of a crust-mantle transition zone. In addition to the time invariant Moho structure, we investigate the temporal variation of the PRFs. We observe an increase in the high frequency (>1 Hz) signal within the first 10 seconds of the receiver functions for teleseismic events after the Tohoku-Oki earthquake relative to those events before the mainshock. This change in the signal lasts for at least 10 days after the earthquake, but is not observed at all stations. Mapping the stations that exhibit increased high frequency signal highlights two areas of active volcanism and the Oga-Ojika Tectonic Line (OOTL), which separates northern Tohoku from southern Tohoku. The increased high frequency signal in the volcanic regions may reflect fluid migration in the crust induced by the strong shaking, while the signal along the OOTL may reflect an increase in fault-zone damage in the seismogenic zone. This suggests that analysis of time-varying receiver functions provides important information on the formation and evolution of the crust.",

            "abstract": "We have constructed a framework associated with the interaction among heat, fluid pressure and inelastic pore creation, and found three nondimensional parameters, Su, Su’ and Ta, which are related to the dilatancy effect, fluid flow effect and the upper limit of the dilatancy, respectively. Without fluid flow, they were found to generate two qualitatively different slip behaviors, acceleration case and spontaneous slip cessation case. In particular, the acceleration case shows the initial deceleration and later acceleration approaching the final high-speed slip. Between the deceleration and acceleration phases, we observe a transient state featured by low and approximately constant slip velocity. We employ the fluid flow effect here and give some implications for understanding the temporal evolution of seismic moments. For example, Ide et al. (2007) found that ordinary earthquakes and slow earthquakes have different forms of temporal evolutions of the seismic moments. In addition, Duputel et al. (2013) observed examples showing exceptional moment evolution behavior even among ordinary earthquakes. Yamashita and Suzuki (2011) successfully modeled the former result by introducing slip-induced dilatancy coupled with fluid flow, while the modeling of the latter remains unaccomplished.\nIf we introduce the fluid flow, we observe only the acceleration case and the duration of the transient state is longer than that without the fluid flow. This can be a model for a slow earthquake if we assume a 2-D model, and the seismic moment of such an earthquake evolves in almost a quadratic function in time. On the other hand, for the acceleration case without the fluid flow, the seismic moment evolution is almost a cubic function. Moreover, for the spontaneous slip cessation case, it evolves with a quadratic or linear function. The framework explaining all the behaviors mentioned above has been obtained. Quantitative investigation on the nondimensional parameters will also be done.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is a challenging region when assessing aerosol impacts due to their large variations in concentration, and varying chemical, physical and optical properties. In the climate effects of atmosphere aerosol indirect force, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play an important role because particles acting as they can grow to cloud droplets by condensation of water vapor, affecting cloud properties in various ways. For example, the increased CCN concentrations lead to the production of more numerous and smaller cloud drops, which can result in optically thicker clouds that tend to reflect more incoming solar radiation back to space (Twomey, 1977). Thus, investigating the physical process of the CCN aerosol that controls cloud droplet formation is important in understanding the radiative transfer and climate effect. In addition, there are still large variabilities in Arctic CCN number concentrations remaining. These variabilities are mainly due to the result of varying aerosol sources and chemical composition (Browse et al., 2012). Especially, the analysis on the long term trends as well as seasonality of CCN and relation with aerosols are very rare and need to be investigated.\nIn this study, CCN concentration data collected at the Zeppelin observatory located on the top of Mt. Zeppelin, Svalbard (78° 54’ N, 11° 53’ E) are analyzed during 2007-2013. The seasonal and yearly trends of CCN in the Arctic region during the long periods are presented.

            "abstract": "The modelling of the impacts of climate change on agriculture requires the inclusion of socio-economic factors. However, while cropping models and economic models of agricultural systems are common, dynamically coupled socio-economic-biophysical models have not received as much success. A promising methodology for modelling the socioeconomic aspects of coupled natural-human systems is participatory system dynamics modelling, in which stakeholders develop mental maps of the socio-economic system that are then turned into quantified simulation models.\nThis methodology has been successful in the water resources management field. However, while the stocks and flows of water resources have also been represented within the system dynamics modelling framework and thus coupled to the socioeconomic portion of the model, cropping models are ill-suited for such reformulation. In addition, most of these system dynamics models were developed without stakeholder input, limiting the scope for the adoption and implementation of their results.\nWe therefore propose a new methodology for the analysis of climate change variability on agroecosystems which uses dynamically coupled system dynamics (socio-economic) and biophysical (cropping) models to represent both physical and socioeconomic aspects of the agricultural system, using two case studies (intensive market-based agricultural development versus subsistence crop-based development) from rural Guatemala. The system dynamics model component is developed with relevant governmental and NGO stakeholders from rural and agricultural development in the case study regions and includes such processes as education, poverty and food security. Common variables with the cropping models (yield and agricultural management choices) are then used to dynamically couple the two models together, allowing for the analysis of the agroeconomic system’s response to and resilience against various climatic and socioeconomic shocks.",

            "abstract": "The specification of worldwide water body distribution is important for discovering hydrological cycle. Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) is a global scale map, which indicates the distribution of water body in 90m resolutions (\nhttp://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/G3WBM/index.html\n). This dataset was mainly built to identify the width of river channels, which is one of major uncertainties of continental-scale river hydrodynamics models. To survey the true width of the river channel, this water body map distinguish Permanent Water Body from Temporary Water Body, which means separating river channel and flood plain. However, rivers with narrower width, which is a major case in usual river, could not be observed in this map. To overcome this problem, updating the algorithm of G3WBM and enhancing the resolutions to 30m is the goal of this research. Although this 30m-resolution water body map uses similar algorithm as G3WBM, there are many technical issues attributed to relatively high resolutions. Those are such as lack of same high-resolution digital elevation map, or contamination problem of sub-pixel scale object on satellite acquired image, or invisibility of well-vegetated water body such as swamp. To manage those issues, this research used more than 30,000 satellite images of Landsat Global Land Survey (GLS), and lately distributed topography data of Shuttle Rader Topography Mission (SRTM) 1 arc-second (30m) digital elevation map. Also the effect of aerosol, which would scatter the sun reflectance and disturb the acquired result image, was considered. Due to these revises, the global water body distribution was established in more precise resolution.",

            "abstract": "Korea has been divided into two countries after World War II. So environmental studies about North Korean are not easy and very limited. There were several flood damages every summer in North Korea since 1995, which induces lots of economic loss and agricultural production decrease. Delineating floodplain is indispensable to estimate the magnitude of flood damage and restore the flooded paddy field after unification.\nRemote Sensing (RS) can provide opportunity to study inaccessible area. In addition, flooding detection is possible. Several research groups study about flooding disaster using RS. Optical images and microwave images have been used in that field. Also, Digital topographic data have been used for flooding detection.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the land characteristics of floodplain by delineating floodplain in inaccessible North Korea using Landsat and digital topographic data. Landsat TM 5 images were used in this study. North Korea had severe flooding disaster since 1995. Among them 1995, 2007 and 2012 flooding are known for serious damages. Two Landsat images before and after flooding of each year were used to delineate floodplain. Study areas are Pyongyang City, Nampo City, North and South Hwanghae Province and South Pyongan Province. Floodplain are derived from overlaid classification image and flood-depth map. 1:25,000 scale digital topographic data were used to make flood-depth map. For land cover classification image enhancement and supervised classification with maximum likelihood classifier were used. Training areas were selected by visual interpretation using Daum-map which provides high resolution image of whole North Korea. The spatial characteristics of the floodplain were discussed based on floodplain map delineated in this study.",

            "abstract": "On April 25 2015 a devastating Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred in Nepal and killed about 9000 people. This event is a typical low dip angle thrust event due to the collision and convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plate in the Himalayan arc since the last 1934 Mw 8.1 event. With the help of modern geophysical instrumental observation, such as seismic wave recordings, GPS and InSAR, the rupture process of this event can be well investigated. We use compressive sensing (CS) method to invert the coseismic radiation of this event in different frequency bands. Our CS results indicate an east-southeastward unilateral rupture process with frequency-dependent properties similar to that in oceanic subduction zone. This frequency-dependence and the seimogenic mechanism of this event are derived from the down-dip varied frictional properties in the Main Himalayan thrust (MHT). In the meanwhile, various observations indicate that the rupture of this event does not reach the ground surface and the shallow stick-slip portion of MHT is still locked, this is different from the 2008 Wenchuan event. To investigate why the rupture stops and does not reach the ground surface, we use numerical method to simulate the influence of high ground topography and fault geometry on the propagation of the rupture. Through combining the results from geophysical observation and numerical simulation, we can better understand the regional tectonic and estimate the potential seismic hazard in the active Himalayan arc.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater flow in bedrock is mainly controlled by the distribution of fractures and faults formed by tectonics. Understanding the formation of fractures and faults due to crust movement and their effects on groundwater flow are important in assessment and development of the groundwater resources in fractured rocks. A three-dimensional solid-fluid coupling model of a homogeneous or heterogeneous cubic bedrock was built with the finite difference model FLAC3D to simulate the rock deformation and fluid flow induced by the crust movement during 10000 years. Two opposite velocity boundary conditions on the left and right part of model were used to simulate the shear stress due to the crust movement. The results indicate that for the homogeneous formation the high compressive stresses and thus the maximum pore pressure concentrate along the middle of formation as time progresses. The pore pressure along the middle of formation increases at early time, then approaches a peak value, and finally decreases as time progresses, indicating that the plastic failure of the formation may happen along the middle of formation where the fluid flow is changed by stresses. The heterogeneous case considered is that the mechanical and hydrological properties are different in one half of the formation from the other half. In this case the distribution and change of the stresses and pore pressure are similar with the homogeneous case while the magnitudes are smaller. The results of this study can help one to understand the effects of tectonics on the groundwater flow in fractured rocks.\nKeywords: solid-fluid coupling model, stresses, pore pressure, groundwater flow",

            "abstract": "Geochemical investigation of fine-grained tsunami sediments has found that a characteristic salinity signature can be commonly found in tsunami deposits and underlying soils following an event. We extend this method to assess historic and paleotsunami deposits and investigate a wider range of particle sizes, with the aim of identifying whether salinity signatures are present and determining the source material of the deposits. Geochemical and mineralogical investigation of seven short cores was undertaken at four sites in New Zealand, where historic and/or palaeotsunami deposits were present as sand, silt or gravel layers intercalated between soils. Geochemical signatures were measured using a high-resolution ITRAX X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner and results were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). We were able to explore the signatures of historical events, verify that prehistoric deposits were laid down by tsunamis, and compare these sediments with the background depositional environment. A t-test of means was applied for salinity marker elements (S, Cl, Br) in the soils immediately above and below tsunami sand layers, to test for evidence of saltwater leaching. The dominant mineralogy of the sediments was determined using portable X-ray diffraction and the data used to consider source material and interpret the corresponding XRF data. Geochemical signatures were found to be site specific, depending primarily on the composition of the material. PCA and HCA results clearly distinguished the signature of the tsunami deposits from the background material at each individual site and were able to confirm or deny palaeodeposits as tsunami-related, by comparison with the signatures of known events in the same core or nearby.",

However, the existing optical-based efforts are limited by the coverage of clouds and shadows, which is prevent in the tropical regions. In this study, we combined PALSAR 25-m mosaic and 30-m multi-temporal Landsat (TM/ETM+) images to map tropical forests and rubber plantation in Hainan Island, China. Based on PALSAR imagery and maximum NDVI, we first identified tropical forests in 2010 using a decision tree algorithm. The resultant forest map has high accuracy (producer/user accuracy > 96%) and can serve as a reliable base map for rubber plantation mapping. Deciduous rubber plantation subsequently extracted from the PALSAR/Landsat-based forest map according to its high NDVI in peak growing season, and low LSWI during the rapid defoliation and foliation stage. The rubber map had good accuracy when validated by ground truth-based Region of Interests (ROIs) and three farm-scale land use maps. This study has clearly demonstrated the advantage of integrating PALSAR and Landsat images and phenology-based algorithm to map tropical forests and rubber plantation.",

It is difficult to estimate the interactive relationship between the fluid and the trees because fluid deform tree architecture and deformed tree changes flow field. Dynamic tree deformation and fluid behavior should be clarified by fluid-structure interaction analysis. For the initial step, we have developed dynamic simulation of tree sway and breakage caused by tsunami based on a vibrating system with multiple degrees of freedom.\nThe target specie of the simulation was Japanese black pine (pinus thunbergii), which is major specie in the coastal forest to secure livelihood area from the damage by blown sand and salt in Japanese coastal area. For the simulation, a tree was segmented into 0.2 m long circular truncated cones. Turning moment induced by tsunami and self-weight was calculated at each segment bottom. Tree deformation was computed on multi-degree-of-freedom vibration equation. Tree sway was simulated by iterative calculation of the tree deformation with time step 0.05 second with temporally varied flow velocity of tsunami. From the calculation of bending stress and turning moment at tree base, we estimated resistance of a Pinus thunbergii tree from tsunami against tree breakage.",

            "abstract": "Foraminifera are popular tools in paleoceanography since incorporation of minor/ major elements and fractionation of stable isotopes into their carbonate shells depend on environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity, pH). Their shell chemistry is markedly different from that of inorganically precipitated CaCO3, reflecting that calcification is a process under strong biological control. The cellular components responsible for calcification are only partly identified in foraminifera and include the involvement of organic templates, trans-membrane ion transporters and selective ion removal. Recent results suggest that transmembrane exchange of H+ for Ca2+ is directly responsible for calcification. The resulting high pH inside and lowered pH outside the foraminifer results in an efficient CO2 ‘trap’ after which carbon dioxide is converted to carbonate prior to calcification. Amongst others, this explains how some foraminifera are able to calcify in undersaturated seawater and may explain their moderate response to ocean acidification. Minor and trace metals incorporated into test carbonate reflect the processes involved in biomineralization and can thus be used to unravel the different factors and processes involved. Still, a more detailed understanding of the processes involved in foraminiferal calcification is needed to explain observed (inter-species) differences in partition coefficients for the incorporation of minor and trace metals and isotopic fractionation.",

            "abstract": "The seismicity of the ultra-slow spreading Southwest (14 mm/y) and intermediate spreading Southeast (60 mm/y) Indian ridges was monitored from February 2012 to March 2013 by the OHASISBIO array of 7 autonomous hydrophones. A total of 1471 events were located with 4 instruments or more, inside the array, with a median location uncertainty < 5 km and a completeness magnitude of mb = 3. Both ridges display similar average rates of seismicity, suggesting that there is no systematic relationship between seismicity and spreading rates. Accretion modes do differ, however, by the along-axis distribution of the seismic events. Along the ultra-slow Southwest Indian Ridge, events are sparse but regularly spaced and scattered up to 50 km off-axis. Along the fast Southeast Indian Ridge, events are irregularly distributed, focusing in narrow regions near the ridge axis at segment ends and along transform faults, whereas ridge-segment centers generally appear as seismic gaps (at the level of completeness of the array). Only two clusters, 6 months apart, are identified in a segment-center at 29°S. From the temporal distribution of the clustered events and comparisons with observations in similar mid-oceanic ridge setting, both clusters seem to have a volcanic origin and to be related to a dike emplacement or a possible eruption on the seafloor. Their onset time and migration rate are comparable to volcanic swarms recorded along the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Overall, the rate of seismicity along the two Indian spreading ridges correlates with the large-scale variations in the bathymetry and shear-wave velocity anomaly in the upper mantle, suggesting that the distribution of the low-magnitude seismicity is mainly controlled by along-axis variations in the lithosphere rheology and temperature.",

From the simulation results, in order to achieve the best effect to pulse compression of incentive transducer, cycle number of carrier frequencies of unit code element need to be chosen according to close degree of the specific signal band width and bandwidth transducer. For single frequency characteristics of piezoelectric ceramic transducer, we have compared to the performance of various transducers in our lab. When the transducer matching combines with coded excitation signal matching, experimental system platform of coded excitation was established. In this project, we analyzed the influence on different excitation signal with different modulation and its pulse compression result by transducer.\nTo improve the resolution of detection of changes of wave velocity in rocks and solve the problem of attenuation in high porous rocks, different high porosity of red sandstones were used, which were processed into different size of rock samples. Coded excitation under uniaxial loading of rock experiments were used to test the variation of wave velocity in rock media under coded excitation conditions. This research detected the changes of wave velocity with the single pulse and coded excitation signal in rocks during dynamic loading, and the result shown that wave velocity of coded excitation signal was stable and reliable. With the ultrasound imaging experimental system set before, imaging experiments under uniaxial loading were performed on rock samples. In the loading process, four transmission methods of observation were used in the rock sample. Four sides of rock sample were respectively arranged a plurality of transducer and the ultrasonic signal was collected. By reading the P wave travel time, we reconstructed velocity and ultrasonic P wave velocity tomography. By comparing the P wave velocity from four different stresses, the result indicated the velocity variation with stress increase, showing a P wave velocity variation tendency of the localization.",

            "abstract": "The Ryukyu subduction zone (RSZ) has been intensively examined in terms of seismic coupling along the plate boundary and tsunami potentials. On the contrary to other subduction zones nearby, such as the Nankai Trough and the Japan Trench, the RSZ has lacked clear evidence of great interplate earthquakes (M>8) for the last few hundred years and thus the overall interplate coupling is thought to be weak (Peterson and Seno, 1984). Correspondingly, geodetic observation implies that a possible coupled zone is narrow and limited to a shallow portion of the plate boundary near the trench (Ando et al., 2009). Recent seismic studies show that very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) are ubiquitously distributed in the forearc region of the Ryukyu arc, implying a variety of slip behaviors along the subduction faults related to fluid distribution (Nakamura and Sunagawa, 2015). However, these findings were derived from land station network and did not have sufficient resolution near the trench to determine spatial relationship of megathrust faults to the seismic activity. Since 2013 we JAMSTEC have been carrying out marine active- and passive-source seismic experiments in the Ryukyu subduction zone to reveal the fine-scale geometry and nature of subduction faults. Here we present integrated seismological evidence for megathrust fault structure and its relation to VLFEs at the southern Ryukyu Trench. Active-source seismic data consistently reveal that the plate boundary and backstop interface form a 40-km-wide frontal prism where low-velocity sedimentary rocks fill in. We find VLFEs occur around the low-velocity wedge where fluids are distributed as suggested by negative polarity in the reflection data. This forearc structure is also coincident with the source region of Yaeyama earthquake tsunami in 1771 (Nakamura, 2009), the most devastating disaster known in this region. Slow ruptures enhanced by the fluid-rich condition at the plate boundary and/or surrounding faults may be a source of VLFEs and large tsunamis.",

            "abstract": "The discovery of fire was one of the earliest of human discoveries. At the beginning, man sensed heat on his skin and then perceived the concept of fire and temperature. Fire and its manifestation in form of light and heat have contributed in many literary sources and religious books. It has being interpreted in various manners and construed by different explanations. Some of these definitions have resemblances with today’s human findings in the argument about heat, temperature, light and their spectra. In this work, we reviewed a broad range of literary, historical, religious and cultural sources to gain deeper insight into the meaning of fire and heat in human’s thought, beliefs and myths from the past to today. We found a close linkage between predecessor’s perception and impression about heat and what is known today as thermal energy. It should be mentioned that we strictly deny the claim of their awareness of modern concepts such as energy or thermodynamics. However, we interfere that they perceived these conceptions. We cannot clearly explain how our predecessor shaped their impression about fire and heat without any knowledge of the nature of new science such as energy, temperature and thermal remote sensing. Nevertheless, their though compromise with modern science. According to the recent findings, temperature play important role as an efficient indicator of sustainability in landscape. Magnitude and distribution of temperature and its changes over time - which could be traced by thermal remote sensing- are of great importance. A concise literature review relating to fire and heat will broaden our knowledge about temperature and thermal remote sensing.",

            "abstract": "Solar active regions (ARs) are the major sources of two kinds of the most violent solar eruptions, namely flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Although they are believed to be two phenomena in the same eruptive process, the productivity of them could be quiet different for various ARs.\nWhy is an AR productive? And why is a flare-rich AR CME-poor? To answer these questions, we compared the recent super flare-rich but CME-poor AR 12192, with other four ARs; two were productive in both flares and CMEs and the other two were inert to produce any M-class or intenser flares or CMEs. By investigating the photospheric parameters based on the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram, we find the three productive ARs have larger magnetic flux, current and free magnetic energy than the inert ARs. Furthermore, the two ARs productive in both flares and CMEs contain higher current helicity, concentrating along both sides of the flaring neutral lines, indicating the presence of a seed magnetic structure( that is highly sheared or twisted) of a CME; they also have higher decay index in the low corona, showing weak constraint. The results suggest that productive ARs are always large and have strong current system and sufficient free energy to power flares, and more importantly whether or not a flare is accompanied by a CME is seemingly related to (1) if there is significant sheared or twisted core field serving as the seed of the CME and (2) if the constraint of the overlying arcades is weak enough.\nMoreover, some productive ARs may frequently produce more than one CME. How does this happen? We do a statistical investigation of waiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs ( CME ssuccessive originating from the same ARs within short intervals) from super ARs in solar cycle 23 to answer this question. The waiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs have a two-component distribution with a separation at about 18 hours, the first component peaks at 7 hours. The correlation analysis among CME waiting times, CME speeds and CME occurrence rates reveals that these quantities are independent to each other, suggesting that the perturbation by preceding CMEs rather than free energy input be the direct cause of quasi-homologous CMEs. The peak waiting time of 7 hours probably characterize the time scale of the growth of instabilities triggered by preceding CMEs.",

A set of confined sediment drifts (the “Kveithola Drift”) is located in the inner part of the trough. We provide for the first time a detailed morphological, seismostratigraphic, lithological and sedimentological insight into this sediment drift. The PARASOUND data show that the drift is mainly well-stratified, characterized by sub-parallel reflections of moderate to high amplitude and good lateral continuity. The reflectors show an abrupt pinch-out on the northern edge where a distinct moat is present, and a gradual tapering to the south. Internally we identify the base of the drift and four internal horizons, which we correlate throughout the drift. Two units display high amplitude reflectors, marked lensoidal character and restricted lateral extent, suggesting a relatively larger contribution of gravity processes to the drift growth. Facies typical for contourite deposition are found in the sediment cores, with strongly bioturbated sediments and abundant silty/sandy mottles that contain shell fragments. These characteristics suggest a strong control by a bottom current flowing along the moat on the northern edge of the drift. Brine-enriched shelf water (BSW) produced during winter and flowing westward in the moat, is suggested to be responsible for the genesis of the Kveithola Drift. The formation of BSW is inferred to have started around 13 cal. ka BP, the onset of drift deposition, suggesting that conditions leading to atmospheric cooling of the surface waters and/or the presence of coastal polynyas and wind have persisted on the western Barents Shelf since that time. The units which formed under a larger influence of gravity processes (dated to the Younger Dryas and to 8.9-8.2 cal ka BP) indicate that bottom current activity was reduced during these two climatically colder periods, possibly due to expanded grounded and sea ice cover over the Barents Sea.",

            "abstract": "In situ sampling from surface is difficult in the exploration of planets and sometimes radar sensing is a better choice. The properties of the surface material such as permittivity, density and depth can be obtained by a surface penetrating radar. The Chang'e-3 (CE-3) landed in the northern Mare Imbrium and a Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) is carried on the Yutu rover to detect the shallow structure of the lunar crust and the properties of the lunar regolith, which will give us a close look at the lunar subsurface.\nWe process the radar data in a way which consist two steps: the regular preprocessing step and migration step. The preprocessing part includes zero time correction, de-wow, gain compensation, DC removal, geometric positioning. Then we combine all radar data obtained at the time the rover was moving, and use FIR filter to reduce the noise in the radar image with a pass band frequency range 200MHz-600MHz. A normal radar image is obtained after the preprocessing step. Using a nonlinear least squares fitting method, we fit the most hyperbolas in the radar image which are caused by the buried objects or rocks in the regolith and estimate the EM wave propagation velocity and the permittivity of the regolith. For there is a fixed mathematical relationship between dielectric constant and density, the density profile of the lunar regolith is also calculated. It seems that the permittivity and density at the landing site is larger than we thought before. Finally with a model of variable velocities, we apply the Kirchhoff migration method widely used in the seismology to transform the the unfocused space-time LPR image to a focused one showing the object’s (most are stones) true location and size. From the migrated image, we find that the regolith depth in the landing site is smaller than previous study and the stone content rises rapidly with depth. Our study suggests that the landing site is a young region and the reworked history of the surface is short, which is consistent with crater density, showing the gradual formation of regolith by rock fracture during impact events.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the response of the remaining Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is an important goal of climate science. The late Pliocene (3.3-3.0 Ma; formerly the middle Pliocene) may offer a natural quasi-analogue to climate in the upcoming centuries: CO2 levels were ~400 PPM, global surface temperatures were 2-3 degrees higher, and sea level was likely at least 6 m higher than today. Yet little is currently known about the history of the pre-Quaternary Greenland ice sheet. IODP Expedition 303 site U1307 at 2575 m depth on the Eirik Ridge extends back to 3.4 Ma, capturing the late-Pliocene warm period adjacent to the southern Greenland ice sheet. Ice-rafted debris records, interpreted on a paleomagnetic reversal age model, suggest roughly 40 ka cyclicity of between ~5% and ~40% sand. Between ~3.3 and 3.2 Ma there is a significant change in lithology characterized by an abrupt reduction in magnetic susceptibility, during which time the sand fraction remains below 10%. Assuming a magnetite mineralogy, hysteresis ratios support a much finer magnetic assemblage of unique provenance in this interval; Mrs/Ms values of the silt fraction range from ~0.2-0.25, compared to ~0.1 in the sediments above and below. The origin this material will be discussed, although this observation is unambiguously consistent with the disappearance of silt transported from the southern Greenland ice sheet. The lack of Greenlandic source material observed in this interval is unique in the last 3.4 Ma at this location, and may indicate full deglaciation of southern Greenland in the late Pliocene.",

            "abstract": "In order to reliably interpret paleomagnetic measurements, the mechanisms of chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) and thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) must be fully understood. Currently, most models of CRM and TRM processes only exist for the smallest, uniformly magnetized grains, termed single domain (SD). However, the magnetic signal from rocks is often dominated by slightly larger grains containing non-uniform magnetization states, termed pseudo-SD (PSD) grains.\nMagnetite (Fe3O4) is the most magnetic naturally occurring mineral on Earth, carrying the dominant magnetic signature in rocks and providing a critical tool in paleomagnetism. The oxidation of Fe3O4 to other iron oxides, such as maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) and hematite (α-Fe2O3), is of particular interest as it influences the preservation of remanence of the Earth's magnetic field by Fe3O4. Further, TRM in Fe3O4 grains is acquired in the direction of the ambient geomagnetic field as they cool below their Curie temperature (TC) of ~ 580 ˚C. The latest transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques like electron holography and environmental TEM (ETEM) allows for the imaging of magnetization in nano-scale minerals during in situ heating under vacuum and controlled atmospheres.\nIn the present study, synthetic Fe3O4 particles in the PSD size range (< 200 nm) were heated in situ in an ETEM under an O2 atmosphere. Close examination of Fe3O4 particles after in situ heating revealed surface degradation, whilst electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirmed their oxidation. The effect of CRM was visualized using electron holography, in the form of reconstructed magnetic induction maps, where the oxidized grains exhibited a loss of overall remanence and change in remanent direction.\nThe thermomagnetic behavior of Fe3O4 particles in the PSD size range is also investigated using off-axis electron holography. Magnetic induction maps, which are recorded during in situ heating up to above the TC, reveal the PSD nature of several Fe3O4 grains by visualizing their vortex domain states. The vortex states in small Fe3O4 grains (Fig. 1a & b) are shown to rotate or collapse into a single-domain state close to its unblocking temperature (Fig. 1c), rather than remaining thermally stable as seen in the vortex states of larger Fe3O4 grains.",

It was previously thought that subduction of the Mongol–Okhotsk oceanic plate beneath the Siberian Craton was north-directed throughout the entire period of subduction, but recent research has provided evidence of southward subduction beneath the Central Mongolia and Erguna massifs during the late Permian and early Mesozoic. However, the spatial and temporal extent of the influence of the Mongol–Okhotsk tectonic regime on NE China remains unclear. In this paper, we present new zircon U–Pb and geochemical data for Triassic volcanic rocks that crop out on the eastern margin of the Xing’an Massif to address the above-mentioned question.\nZircon U–Pb dating indicates that the Triassic volcanism in the Xing’an Massif occurred in two stages during the Middle (~240 Ma) and Late (~224 Ma) Triassic. Triassic volcanism consists of a suite of calc-alkaline trachybasalt and andesite, and are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE; e.g., Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf), indicating an affinity to arc-type volcanic rocks. The Triassic volcanic rocks formed in an active continental margin setting associated with southward subduction of the Mongol–Okhotsk oceanic plate. Combined with the spatial and temporal variations of late Mesozoic igneous rocks in NE China, we conclude that the spatial extent of the influence of the Mongol–Okhotsk tectonic regime reached at least the eastern margin of the Xing’an Massif, and the temporal influence of this tectonism spanned from the late Permian to the early Early Cretaceous.\nThis research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41330206) and Graduate Innovation Fund of Jilin University (Project 2015038).",

This is the target of operational earthquake forecasting (OEF). During the OEF development in Italy we identify several challenges that range from pure science to the more practical interface of science with society. From a scientific point of view, although earthquake clustering is the clearest empirical evidence about earthquake occurrence, and OEF clustering models are the most (successfully) tested hazard models in seismology, we note that some seismologists are still reluctant to accept their scientific reliability. After exploring the motivations of these scientific doubts, we also look into an issue that is often overlooked in this discussion, i.e., in any kind of hazard analysis, we do not use a model because it is the true one, but because it is the better than anything else we can think of.\nThe non-scientific aspects are mostly related to the fact that OEF usually provides weekly probabilities of large eartquakes smaller than 1%. These probabilities are considered by some seismologists too small to be of interest or useful. However, in a recent collaboration with engineers we show that such earthquake probabilities may lead to intolerable individual risk of death. Interestingly, this debate calls for a better definition of the still fuzzy boundaries among the different expertise required for the whole risk mitigation process.\nThe last and probably more pressing challenge is related to the communication to the public. In fact, a wrong message could be useless or even counterproductive. Here we show some progresses that we have made in this field working with communication experts in Italy.",

It couples a precipitation probabilistic model based on weather patterns, with a stochastic rainfall-runoff simulation process using a conceptual lumped model. It allows exploring an exhaustive set of hydrological conditions and watershed responses to intense rainfall events. Since 2006, it has been widely applied in France to about one hundred watersheds for dam spillway design, and also aboard (Norway, Canada and central Europe among others).\nHowever, its application to large watersheds (above 10 000 km²) faces some significant issues: spatial heterogeneity of rainfall and hydrological processes and flood peak damping due to hydraulic effects (flood plains, natural or man-made embankment) being the more important.\nThis led to the development of an extreme flood simulation framework for large and heterogeneous watersheds, based on the SCHADEX method. Its main features are:\nDivision of the large (or main) watershed into several smaller sub-watersheds, where the spatial homogeneity of the hydro-meteorological processes can reasonably be assumed, and where the hydraulic effects can be neglected.\nIdentification of pilot watersheds where discharge data are available, thus where rainfall-runoff models can be calibrated. They will be parameters donors to non-gauged watersheds.\nSpatially coherent stochastic simulations for all the sub-watersheds at the daily time step.\nIdentification of a selection of simulated events for a given return period (according to the distribution of runoff volumes at the scale of the main watershed).\nGeneration of the complete hourly hydrographs at each of the sub-watersheds outlets.\nRouting to the main outlet with hydraulic 1D or 2D models.\nThe presentation will be illustrated with the case-study of the Isère watershed (9981 km), a French snow-driven watershed.

            "abstract": "The Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ) is the most volcanically productive of Iceland's neovolcanic zones. In addition to being the source of numerous small but disruptive eruptions, such Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 and Grímsvötn in 2011, the EVZ is notable for generating very large eruptions such as the environmentally impacting Laki eruption in 1783–84 and the widely dispersed Saksunarvatn Ash. Thus, investigating the plumbing systems of volcanoes in the EVZ not only reveals information about magma reservoir behaviour and crustal structure, but also has important implications for hazard management. However, in order to obtain reliable estimates of pre-eruptive magma storage conditions and depths from minerals a number of conditions need to be met first. Firstly, all estimates of pre-eruptive conditions need to be placed into petrogenetic frameworks that consider the extensive disequilibrium that results not only from fractionation, but also from magma mixing and crystal mush entrainment. Secondly, it is important to verify that the mineral-melt equilibrium, i.e. thermobarometeric, models used are well calibrated at the expected conditions of magma storage. Using a range of techniques including QEMSCAN imaging, textural analysis and geochemical microanalysis of crystals, glasses and melt inclusions, we present internally consistent models of magma evolution and storage for a number of eruptions in the EVZ, including Laki and the 10ka Grímsvötn tephra series (i.e. Saksunarvatn Ash). All eruptions studied preserve evidence of mixing and crystallisation of primitive melts in the mid-crust (8–20 km) followed by crystallisation of evolved and, in general, more incompatible element-enriched melts in the shallow crust (0–8 km) shortly before eruption. Substantial uncertainties in storage depths nevertheless remain because of incomplete calibration of clinopyroxene-melt equilibria at mid-crustal pressures. As part of an ongoing experimental campaign on Icelandic magma compositions at moderate pressures (1-5 kbar) we seek to improve the calibration of barometers in basaltic systems.",

            "abstract": "In northern Chile and southern Peru, deformed early Miocene ignimbrites characterize the Western Andean Slope (WAS). In this study we use the emplacement and subsequent deformation of these large-volume ignimbrites to reconstruct the pre-eruptive paleotopography and constrain Miocene uplift rates across the WAS in northernmost Chile. Our results provide evidence that the uplift of the WAS began as early as Eocene-Oligocene time, with elevated rates of uplift during the middle-late Miocene.\nIn northernmost Chile, the WAS is covered by the early Miocene Oxaya Formation (22.7 Ma – 19.6 Ma), a series of ignimbrites and minor sediments that includes the large-volume (>3000 km3), 21.9 Ma Cardones ignimbrite. Following eruption, these ignimbrites were faulted, tilted, and folded into the long-wavelength Huaylillas anticline, which forms a steep slope rising ~2300 m over a distance of ~40 km.\nBased on the assumption that large-volume ignimbrites like the Cardones infill existing topography to create a relatively uniform low-gradient surface slope of ~1°, we performed a line-balanced reconstruction of this surface. Results suggest the existence of a proto-WAS, with an elevation up to ~1800 m, prior to 21.9 Ma. This proto-WAS had local paleo-lows, in which the Cardones ignimbrite was able to reach thicknesses exceeding 1000 m. We interpret these lows as river valleys that transported sediment from the proto-WAS westwards towards the Central Basin, creating an Eocene-Oligocene (~50-22.7 Ma) clastic wedge, expressed today as the Azapa Formation.\nAfter deposition of the Oxaya Formation, the WAS experienced <1° of westward tilting, faulting, and folding resulting in ~2000 m of uplift along the hinge of the Huaylillas anticline. U-Pb geochronology of zircons from intercalated volcanic units in the syn-tectonic Huaylas Basin on the eastern limb of the anticline suggest that the majority of this Miocene uplift occurred between 16 and 6 Ma.",

            "abstract": "It was demonstrated by Yabe (2002) that friction properties and AE (acoustic emission) activities evolve with accumulation of sliding. However, large sliding distances of ~65 mm in his experiments were achieved by recurring ~10 mm sliding on the same fault. The evolution of friction coefficient was discontinuous, when rock samples were reset. Further, normal stress was not kept constant. To overcome these problems and to reexamine the evolutions of friction properties and AE activities with continuous large sliding under a constant normal stress, we developed a rotary shear apparatus. The evolutions of friction and AE up to ~80 mm sliding under a normal stress of 5 MPa were investigated. Rate dependence of friction was the velocity strengthening (a-b>0 in rate and state friction law) at the beginning. The value of a-b gradually decreased with sliding to negative (velocity weakening). Then, it took a constant negative value, when the sliding reached a critical distance. The m-value of Ishimoto-Iida’s relation of AE activity increased with sliding at the beginning and converged to a constant value at the critical sliding distance. The m-value showed a negative rate dependence at the beginning, but became neutral after sliding of the critical distance. The sliding distances required to converge the a-b value, the m-value and the rate dependence of the m-value are almost identical to one another. These results are the same as those by Yabe (2002), suggesting the intermission of sliding little affected the evolutions. We, then, examined evolutions of AE source parameters such as source radii and stress drops. The average source radius was constant over the whole sliding distance, while the average stress drop decreased at the beginning of sliding, and converged to a constant value. The sliding distance required to the conversion was the same as that for the above mentioned evolutions of friction property or AE activity.",

            "abstract": "The major-, trace-elements and H2O contents of minerals from peridotite xenoliths hosted in the Mesozoic lamprophyres of Anyuan area (SE China) were analyzed by electron microprobe, LA-ICPMS and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. The xenoliths include spinel harzburgites, lherzolites with or without spinel. The harzburgites and lherzolites with spinels are moderately refractory (Mg#Ol=90.2–91.2), whereas lherzolites without spinels are fertile (Mg#Ol=89.1–89.9). The REE patterns of clinopyroxenes in these xenoliths vary from LREE-depleted, through flat, to LREE-enriched patterns, and commonly exhibit negative U, Pb and Ti anomalies. The results suggest that the xenoliths mostly experienced 1–10% partial melting and subsequently silicate metasomatism. Water contents of clinopyroxene (cpx), orthopyroxene (opx), and olivine (ol) range from 330 to 404 ppm, 126 to 279 ppm, and 11 to 33 ppm, respectively. No correlations between H2O content and melting index (i.e., YbN in cpx, Cr# in spinel) and metasomatic index ((La/Yb)N in cpx) show that extent of partial melting and mantle metasomatism did not modify the initial H2O contents. Most water contents of the mantle source are largely preserved in pyroxenes. The whole-rock water contents range from 67 to 124 ppm, similar to that of the MORB source. Therefore, we suggest that the Cenozoic lithospheric mantle of the Cathaysia block is accreted from the upwelled and cooled asthenospheric mantle. On the other hand, the widespread refractory lithospheric mantle ever existed in the western Cathaysia. The coexistence of fertile mantle and refractory-transitional mantle beneath the west Cathaysia block might be attributed to the refertilization of the lithospheric mantle by the upwelling asthenospheric materials and eventually replacement resulting from the cooling of the upwelled asthenosphere.",

            "abstract": "Capturing complex, multiscale geologic heterogeneity in subsurface flow models is challenging. Surface-based modeling (SBM) offers an alternative approach to conventional grid-based methods. In SBM, all geologic features that impact the distribution of material properties, such as porosity and permeability, are modeled as volumes bounded by surfaces. Within these volumes, termed geologic domains, the material properties are constant. A typical model contains numerous such domains. The surfaces have parametric, grid-free representation which, in principle, allows for unlimited complexity, since no resolution is implied at the stage of modeling and features of any scale can be included.\nWe demonstrate a method to create stochastic, surface-based models using computer aided design (CAD) and efficiently discretise them for flow simulation. The surfaces are represented using non-uniform, rational B-splines (NURBS), and processed in a CAD environment employing Boolean operations. We show examples of fluvial channels, fracture networks and scour events. Cartesian-like grids are not able to capture the complex geometries in these models without using excessively large numbers of grid blocks. Unstructured meshes can more efficiently approximate the geometries. However, high aspect ratio features and varying curvatures present challenges for algorithms to produce quality, unstructured meshes without excessive user interaction.\nWe contribute an automated integrated workflow that processes the input geometry created in the CAD environment, creates the final model, and discretises it with a quality tetrahedral mesh. For computational efficiency, we use a geometry-adaptive mesh that distributes the element density and size in accordance with the geometrical complexity of the model. We show examples of finite-element flow simulations of the resulting geologic models. The new approach has broad application in modeling subsurface flow.",

            "abstract": "The aeromagnetic map of Iberia features outstanding anomalies that have been key to define the Central Iberian Arc, a late-orogenic orocline in the western part of the Variscan belt. The most studied of them is the EGMA (Eastern Galicia Magnetic Anomaly), which follows the Lugo-Sanabria extensional dome and is probably associated with it. Among the existing models of this anomaly, those relating it with magnetite-rich inhomogeneous granites and migmatites formed during late-Variscan extension seem to be more plausible ones. However, this and other interpretations involving deep-seated mafic/ultramafic bodies lack resolution as they are based on the aeromagnetic dataset. New ground magnetic data have been acquired in the northern part of the Xistral Tectonic Window, at the core of the Lugo dome where its deepest rocks crop out. The resulting maps show that the anomaly ranges ~1000 nT (vs. 190 nT on the aeromagnetic map) and that the most important maxima lie on top of extensional detachments located on high-grade metasediments or inhomogeneous granites. 2D forward modeling indicates that the magnetization is carried by upper Neoproterozoic and early Cambrian metasediments, partially melted during late-Variscan high-T and low-P metamorphic event linked to the extensional collapse. Furthermore, the anomaly maxima are spatially related with detachments, where the metasediments were strongly sheared. Therefore, the P-T, redox and fluid pressure conditions necessary for the formation of magnetite seem related with the extensional process and the dynamics of its structures. Many magnetic anomalies of the Central Iberian Arc lie on top of Variscan extensional domes and accordingly may have a similar origin. Special attention is paid to the Gredos Magnetic Anomaly, coincident with the batholith of the same name. Preliminary magnetic mapping and modeling indicate that the anomaly is previous to the intrusion of the Jurassic Alentejo-Plasencia dyke and to the tardi-Variscan faults along which it intruded. Even though migmatites and inhomogeneous granites outcropping in the area are not the source of the anomaly, deeper magnetite-bearing facies as those developed in a high-T and low-P context in the Xistral Tectonic Window may occur at depth in the neighborhood of sub-horizontal extensional detachments.",

We reconstructed the neodymium isotopic ratio (εNd) of authigenic Fe-Mn oxide coatings and detrital sediments on the Bering Slope (IODP Expedition 323 site U1345; water depth 1008 m) over the last 500 kyrs. The εNd is a quasi-conservative water mass tracer. We compared three different leaching techniques to assure that authigenic signals are captured without contamination from terrigenous sources: (1) leaching (3 hours) with 0.02 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HH) in 25% buffered acetic acid after decarbonation; sediment/solution (v/v) > 10, (2) leaching (1 hour) with 0.02 M HH in 25% buffered acetic acid without decarbonation; sediment/solution ~ 1, and (3) leaching (1 hour) with 0.005 M HH in 1.5% buffered acetic acid-0.003 M Na-EDTA without decarbonation; sediment/solution > 40. The low Al concentrations and less radiogenic εNdvalues indicated that method (2) is the most appropriate leaching process.\nThe average εNd of the authigenic fraction over the last 500 kyrs is -3.3 ± 0.9 (1σ, n=38), with large temporal fluctuations. The εNd of authigenic and detrital fractions are well correlated (r2 ~ 0.66), suggesting that the bottom water composition in the Bering Sea was governed by terrigenous inflow from surrounding areas. Radiogenic εNd peaks (up to -1.9) seem to be influenced by radiogenic water inflow from the the Kamchatka or Aluetian arcs. The high bulk density and low b* values imply higher terrigenous versus biological contribution and enhanced sea ice formation. Subsequent brine formation would have triggered sinking of radiogenic surface water, forming the NPIW. On the other hand, non-radiogenic εNd troughs (down to -5.3) are observed at times of low bulk density and high b* values. We presume higher biological productivity which is supported by the high opal content at these intervals (Kanematsu et al., 2013). Sea level rise and boundary exchange with terrigenous sediment derived from N. America is a likely mechanism.\nThis work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the NRF funded by Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (No. 2014 0498836)",

            "abstract": "The characteristics of stable continental crust are the end-result of a long series of magmatic and tectonic processes. Most studies of crustal formation have focussed on the composition and vertical stratification of the crust. Yet, when it comes to its thermal structure and mechanical strength, the thickness of the crust is an equally important variable. Heat flow and heat production data provide important constraints on all these characteristics as well as on crustal evolution. A global analysis of heat flow and thickness data shows that there is no correlation between these two variables. On a large scale, the bulk crustal heat production is not constant and its variations are partially compensated by changes of crustal thickness. On a smaller scale, within a geological province, the total crustal heat production varies by large amounts independently of crustal thickness changes. The range of Moho temperatures within a stable geological province may be as wide as\n≈\n300K. The calculated variations in Moho temperatures explain seismic observations of P\nn\nand mantle shear wave velocities.\nArchean provinces are characterized by low values of heat flow and heat production today. Accounting for the rundown of heat producing elements, however, one finds that, at the time of their stabilization, these provinces had almost the same heat flow and crustal heat production as younger ones. At that time, lower crustal temperatures were close to the solidus of typical continental assemblages. This indicates that the intrinsic thermal regime of the crust determines the conditions for crustal stability. Post-orogenic melting events may occur without external forcing and lead to the vertical differentiation of heat producing elements. The change in thermal structure leads to lower temperatures and higher mechanical strength in the new continental block. We show that crust that has the heat production characteristics of today's average continents cannot be thicker than about 50 km if it is to resist tectonic forces and/or gravitational collapse.",

Since a long time, tridimensional X-ray images have been used to characterize the structures of intact soil cores. Conversely, imaging of water dynamics in soil structures was scarcely developed except on quite small samples in the order of a few centimeters to a few millimeters. As soil structure is a key-controlling factor, the understanding of the complex relationships between the topology and morphology of the pore space on flow distribution and hydraulic properties cannot be undertaken on such small samples. Therefore, we recently proposed the visualization and characterization of flow processes at the core scale (soil volumes of dimensions above 10 cm) with 3D image sequences acquired in a X-ray medical scanner. Last generation of these scanners combining a helical acquisition mode to the multislice capability can now provide very short acquisition times in the order of few seconds for a decimeter column. The 3D image sequences acquired during simulated rainfall events within the scanner were processed and analyzed with new ad hoc tools. Results will focus on 1) the recognition of the functional part of the macropore network related to the flow distribution, 2) its comparison to the entire structure and 3) the estimation of the macroscopic surface exchange between the active macropore network and the soil matrix obtained during the recording of water infiltration.",

In order to determine the pressure and temperature dependence of diffusion in these geologically relevant liquids, we have conducted experiments of Si, O, and Cr diffusion in liquid iron over the P-T range of 1.5—18 GPa and 1850—2450 K, and Si, O, Mg, Ca tracer and Ni, Co chemical diffusion in peridotite liquids over the P-T range of 4—24 GPa and 2248—2623 K in a multi-anvil apparatus. Our results show a very small pressure dependence (< 1 cm3/mol) of alloying element diffusion (Si, O, Cr) in liquid iron over the P-T range of the study and remarkably good consistency with first principles calculations (Pozzo et al. 2013. Phys. Rev. B 87, 014110; Ichikawa and Tsuchiya. 2015. Phys. Earth Planet. Inter., in press) when extrapolated to outer core conditions. Diffusion rates of Si, O, Ca, Mg, Ni, Co in silicate melt decrease with increasing pressure to a minimum at approximately 10 GPa. An anomalous pressure effect is observed above ~10 GPa such that diffusivities rapidly increase with increasing pressure for all elements to a maximum at ~12 GPa, consistent with previous work on peridotite viscosity to 13 GPa (Liebske et al. 2005. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 240, 589). Above ~12 GPa, diffusivities decrease with increasing pressure to 24 GPa.

            "abstract": "Vast amounts of high quality strong motion data are indispensable inputs of the analyses in the field of geotechnical and earthquake engineering however, high cost of installation of the strong motion systems constitutes the biggest obstacle for worldwide dissemination. In recent years, MEMS based (micro-electro-mechanical systems) accelerometers have been used in seismological research-oriented studies as well as earthquake engineering oriented projects basically due to precision obtained in downsized instruments. In this research our primary goal is to ensure the usage of these low-cost instruments in the creation of shake-maps immediately after a strong earthquake. Second goal is to develop software that will automatically process the real-time data coming from the rapid response network and create shake-map.\nFor those purposes, four MEMS sensors have been set up to deliver real-time data. Data transmission is done through 3G modems. A subroutine was coded in assembler language and embedded into the operating system of each instrument to create MiniSEED files with packages of 1-second instead of 512-byte packages.The Matlab-based software calculates the strong motion (SM) parameters at every second, and they are compared with the user-defined thresholds. A voting system embedded in the software captures the event if the total vote exceeds the threshold. The user interface of the software enables users to monitor the calculated SM parameters either in a table or in a graph (Figure 1). A small scale and affordable rapid response network is created using four MEMS sensors, and the functionality of the software has been tested and validated using shake table tests. The entire system is tested together with a reference sensor under real strong ground motion recordings as well as series of sine waves with varying amplitude and frequency. The successful realization of this software allowed us to set up a test network at Tekirdağ Province, the closest coastal point to the moderate size earthquake activities in the Marmara Sea, Turkey.",

            "abstract": "Nonlinear waves are found everywhere, in fluids, atmosphere, laboratory, space and astrophysical plasmas. The interplay of nonlinear effects, dispersion and dissipation in the medium can lead to a variety of nonlinear waves and turbulence. Two cases of coherent nonlinear waves: chorus and electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) and their impact on modifying the plasma medium are discussed. Chorus is a right-hand, circularly-polarized electromagnetic plane wave. Dayside chorus is a bursty emission composed of rising frequency “elements” with duration of ~0.1 to 1.0 s. Each element is composed of coherent subelements with durations of ~1 to 100 ms or more. The cyclotron resonant interaction between energetic electrons and the coherent chorus waves is studied. An expression for the pitch angle transport due to this interaction is derived considering a Gaussian distribution for the time duration of the chorus elements. The rapid pitch scattering can provide an explanation for the ionospheric microbursts of ~0.1 to 0.5 s in bremsstrahlung x-rays formed by ~10–100 keV precipitating electrons. On the other hand, the ESWs are observed in the electric field component parallel to the background magnetic field, and are usually bipolar or tripolar. Generation of coherent ESWs has been explained in terms of nonlinear fluid models of ion- and electron-acoustic solitons and double layers (DLs) based on Sagdeev pseudopotential technique. Fast Fourier transform of electron- and ion-acoustic solitons/DLs produces broadband wave spectra which can explain the properties of the electrostatic turbulence observed in the magnetosheath and plasma sheet boundary layer, and in the solar wind, respectively.",

            "abstract": "First stage of continental break-up, though intensively studied, is yet poorly understood. This is partly because actual rifting areas are either too mature (more than 10 My) or not easily accessible (thick sediment cover or under water). The North Tanzania part of the East African Rift is the place of a lithosphere's early break-up (less than 5My) in response to a combination of regional pulling forces and mantle upwelling. Deformation there results from complex interactions between magmatic intrusions, faulting, asthenospheric dynamics and far field stresses. CoLiBrEA (ANR) and CRAFTI (NSF) are two multidisciplinary projects which collaboratively focus on this area to understand the interactions between faults and magma, the role of inherited structures and rheological heterogeneities of the lithosphere.\nFor that purpose, we deployed 38 broadband seismic stations in the Natron and Ngorongoro areas from January 2013 to December 2014 and carried out a 120 km East-West magnetotelluric (MT) profile to image the crustal and mantle structures. The 3D resistivity model, obtained from the inversion of the MT data along the profile, shows an highly heterogeneous crust with three-dimensional structures over a more homogeneous upper mantle. The first inversion result from the receiver function (RF) by the Zhu and Kanamori's inversion method show a thick crust (~35 km) with important variations (maximum 15km) especially in the Ngorongoro area, and an average Vp/Vs ratio of 1.75. We then completed this study by combining the MT data and the RF at the 11 sites of the EW profile. For each site, we built a 1D velocity model (Vs and VpVs) obtained by combining the Sambridge forward solution with a non linear descent research algorithm and constrained by the resistivity structure. The inversion shows an heterogeneous crust obviously dominated by the Moho interface at different depths, with low velocity layers mainly corresponding to low resistivity features.",

But, in the year of 2008, Shen et al. reported a definite case that the intensity of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the shock-MC interaction structure increase greatly. They further found that such enhancement is the main cause of the largest SEP event in solar cycle 23. The questions remained are: Did all the shock-ICME(MC) structure cause the enhancement of the SEP intensity? If not, why it only happened in some events? Is there any other mechanism which can make the energetic particle intensity in ICME enhanced? To answer these questions, the SEP signatures in all ICMEs including the shock-ICME interaction structures from 1996 to 2014 are studied detail. It is found that the SEP intensities enhanced in about half of the shock-ICME interaction events. Meanwhile, large fraction of energetic particles intensity enhanced ICMEs are interacted with shocks. To find the possible condition and physical mechanismof such enhancement, the parameters of the shock, ICME(MC) and etc. are detailed analyzed.",

            "abstract": "New particle formation in the atmosphere accounts for 40-70% of global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). It is a complex process involving many precursors: sulphuric acid, ions, ammonia, and a wide range of natural and anthropogenic organic molecules. The CLOUD laboratory chamber experiment at CERN allows the contributions of different compounds to be disentangled in a uniquely well-controlled environment. To date, CLOUD has measured over 500 formation rates (Riccobono 2014, Kirkby 2015, Dunne 2015), under conditions representative of the planetary boundary layer and free troposphere.\nTo understand the sensitivity of the climate to anthropogenic atmospheric aerosols, we must quantify historical aerosol radiative forcing. This requires an understanding of pre-industrial aerosol sources. Here we show pre-industrial nucleation over land usually involves organic molecules in the very first steps of cluster formation. The complexity of the organic vapors is a major challenge for theoretical approaches. Furthermore, with fewer sulphuric acid and ammonia molecules available to stabilize nucleating clusters in the pre-industrial atmosphere, ions from radon or galactic cosmic rays were probably more important than they are today.\nParameterizations of particle formation rates determined in CLOUD as a function of precursor concentrations, temperature and ions are being used to refine the GLOMAP aerosol model (Spracklen 2005). The model simulates the growth, transport and loss of particles, translating nucleation rates to CCN concentrations. This allows us to better understand the effects of pre-industrial and present-day particle formation. I will present new results on global CCN based on CLOUD data, including estimates of anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing, currently the most uncertain driver of climate change (IPCC 2013).\n",

            "abstract": "Assessing how mineral surfaces, especially at small scale, can protect soil organic carbon (SOC) from biodegradation is crucial. The question we address in this work is whether different mineral species lead to different organo-mineral interactions and stabilize different quantities of SOM and different types of SOC.\nHere we used the unique opportunity offered by long term bare fallows (BF) to study in situ C dynamics in several fine fractions of a silty loam soil. With no vegetation i.e. no external input of fresh C, the plant-free soil of the Versailles 42 Plots (INRA, France) has been progressively enriched in persistent SOC during the 80 years of BF. Contrasted mineral phases of the clay size fraction were isolated by size fractionation on samples from 5 different dates (0, 10, 22, 52, and 79 years after the beginning of the BF, four field replicates per date). Four fractions were studied: total clays (< 2 µm), and three sub fractions in the clay (fine clay: 0 - 0.05 µm, intermediate clay: 0.05 - 0.2 µm, and coarse clay: 0.2 - 2 µm). X-ray diffraction analyses showed contrasted mineralogies in the fine and intermediate clay (smectite and mixed layered illite/smectite) as opposed to the coarse clay (smectite, illite, kaolinite and mixed layered I/S). We performed CHN elemental analysis and synchrotron based spectroscopy and microscopy (NEXAFS bulk and STXM at the carbon K edge of 280 eV, CLS Saskatoon, Canada) to study the dynamics, the distribution and the chemical speciation of the SOC in these fractions.\nThe quantity of C appears to be stabilized after 50 years of BF, even though the dynamics are different for the three clay fractions. Indeed, coarse and intermediate clays have the same final C content but coarse clays lose more C. Fine clay experiences the highest C losses and displays the highest final C content suggesting that fine clays contained more labile C and more persistent C. In all fractions, C:N ratios are really low (below 8) and are decreasing with time, evidencing the dominant presence of microbial SOC. STXM-NEXAFS data shows that, in the fine and intermediate clay fractions, during the first 50 years of BF all mineral particles are associated with SOC. On the contrary, in the coarse clays, SOC displays more diversity: the chemical signature is more diverse and mineral particles not associated with SOC appear more quickly.",

As a result of rising temperatures and steady or slightly rising levels of specific humidity, heat stress is projected to become increasingly severe. Here we show that heat stress as measured by two common indices -- the heat index and the wet-bulb temperature -- is projected to rapidly and dramatically increase, and that by mid-century crippling summertime conditions are possible across some of the most densely populated regions of the planet. Many of these regions are places where cooling infrastructure is scarce, adaptive capacity is low, and populations are rapidly rising. We find that by the end of the 21st century, the habitability of some regions of the planet may be questionable due to heat stress alone, and in many other regions severe impacts to human health, infrastructure, agriculture, and economic performance will create significant societal stress and necessitate rapid adaptation.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization is an abrupt hydrological disturbance that affects large parts of the world. For ameliorative management, an understanding of how flow partitioning and storage dynamics are affected is crucial, yet this remains limited. This reflects the lack of integrated monitoring and modelling frameworks for characterizing these hydrological response dynamics to incremental urban development.\nHere we use a coupled flow-isotope model to assess the impacts of urbanisation (~20%) on stream water age distributions in an 8 km2 catchment. A conceptual runoff model was used with flux tracking to estimate the time-varying age of stream water at the outlet and both urban and non-urban sub-catchments over a 3 year period. Combined objective functions of both flow and isotope metric constrained model structures, improved calibration and aided model evaluation. Specifically, we explored (1) the age distribution of stream water draining urban and non-urban areas, (2) the integrated effect of these different land uses at larger catchment scales, and (3) how the modelling can predict the impacts on the stream water age of future urbanization proposals.\nThe results showed that stream water draining the most urbanized tributary was youngest with a mean transit time (MTT) of < 6 months compared with ~18 months in the non-urban tributary. For the catchment outlet, the MTT was around 9 months. Here, the response of urban areas dominated smaller and moderate events, but rural contributions dominated during the wettest periods, giving a bi-modal distribution of water ages. Predictions for planned developments in the area indicated that just a 5% increase in urban area would give dramatic reductions in MTTs that can propagate to the larger catchment scale. This novel approach offers a framework for understanding the cumulative impacts of disturbances on streams. It can also contribute to the design of more sustainable urban water design in terms of targeted restriction of rapid water fluxes.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops an optimal reservoir Refill Hedging Rule (RHR) for combined water supply and flood operation using mathematical analysis. A two-stage model is developed to formulate the trade-off between operations for conservation benefit and flood damage in the reservoir refill season. Based on the probability distribution of the maximum refill water availability at the end of the second stage, three zones are characterized according to the relationship among storage capacity, expected storage buffer (ESB), and maximum safety excess discharge (MSED). The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the model show that the optimality of the refill operation involves making the expected marginal loss of conservation benefit from unfilling (i.e., ending storage of refill period less than storage capacity) as nearly equal to the expected marginal flood damage from levee overtopping downstream as possible while maintaining all constraints. This principle follows and combines the hedging rules for water supply and flood management. A RHR curve is drawn analogously to water supply hedging and flood hedging rules, showing the trade-off between the two objectives. The release decision result has a linear relationship with the current water availability, implying the linearity of RHR for a wide range of water conservation functions (linear, concave, or convex). A demonstration case shows the impacts of factors. Larger downstream flood conveyance capacity and empty reservoir capacity allow a smaller current release and more water can be conserved. Economic indicators of conservation benefit and flood damage compete with each other on release, the greater economic importance of flood damage is, the more water should be released in the current stage, and vice versa. Below a critical value, improving forecasts yields less water release, but an opposing effect occurs beyond this critical value. Finally, the Danjiangkou Reservoir case study shows that the RHR together with a rolling horizon decision approach can lead to a gradual dynamic refilling, indicating its potential for practical use.",

            "abstract": "The reports of inter-species variability to intra-test heterogeneity in Mg/Ca in several species of foraminifera have raised question about its use in estimation of seawater temperatures and necessitate field and culture studies to verify it for species from different habitats. In this study, we attempt to investigate if Mg/Ca in larger benthic foraminifera (LBF) could be a potential proxy of seawater temperatures for shallow marine carbonates. The samples were collected in different seasons from coral reef at Akajima (Okinawa, Japan). The Ca and Mg of 13 species of LBF and small benthic foraminifera from the same season were determined to examine variation in Mg/Ca among the species calcified under presumably the same temperature and salinity conditions. We also analyzed Amphistegina lessoni from different seasons for Ca, Mg and δ18O to determine variation in Mg/Ca with temperature and see how the two proxies of temperatures, Mg/Ca and δ18O, correlate in the same species. The species cluster about two distinctly separated Mg/Ca values. The first group comprising species of Amphistegina, Gypsina, Ammonia and Elphidium have relatively lower Mg/Ca, varying from 30 to 45 mmol/mol. The second group, having average Mg/Ca ranging from ~110 to 170 mmol/mol, includes species of Schlumbergerella, Baculogypsinoides, Baculogypsina, Heterostegina, Operculina, Calcarina, Amphisorus, Alveolinella and Poroeponides. The result suggests large interspecies variability implying vital effect in foraminiferal Mg/Ca. There is no distinct difference in Mg/Ca values between porcelaneous and hyaline types or symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free types. In Amphistegina lessoni the variation in Mg/Ca between individuals of the same season is as large as variation across the seasons. There is no correlation between Mg/Ca and seawater temperature.

            "abstract": "In this talk I will discuss studies our group has conducted to investigate the role of anthropogenic climate change in the heavy rains of 2010-2012 and the heat and drought of 2013. Using a range of methodologies based on coupled climate models from the CMIP5 archive and very large atmosphere-only ensembles from the Weather@Home Australia-New Zealand ensemble we have found increases in the likelihood of hot extremes, such as the summer of 2012/13 and individual record-breaking hot days within that summer. In contrast, studies of the precipitation extremes that occurred in the summer of 2011/12 found limited evidence for a substantial anthropogenic role in these events.\nI will also present briefly on avenues of research we are currently pursuing in the Australian community. These include investigating whether anthropogenic climate change has altered the likelihood of weather associated with bushfires and the implementation of perturbed physics in the Weather@Home ensemble to allow us to study the potential role of human-induced climate change on extreme rainfall events.",

            "abstract": "It is shown that two types of, slow and fast, ion-acoustic solitary waves can occur in a solar wind plasma consisting of fluid hot protons, hot alpha particles streaming with respect to protons, and suprathermal electrons having k- distribution. The fast ion-acoustic mode is similar to the ion-acoustic mode of proton-electron plasma, and can support only positive potential solitons. The slow ion-acoustic mode is a new mode that occurs due to the presence of alpha particles. This mode can support both positive and negative solitons and double layers. The slow ion-acoustic mode can exist even when the relative streaming, U0, between alphas and protons is zero, provided alpha temperature, Ti, is not exactly equal to 4 times the proton temperature, Tp. An increase of the k- index leads to an increase in the critical Mach number, maximum Mach number and the maximum amplitude of both slow and fast ion-acoustic solitons. The model can explain the amplitudes and widths, but not shapes, of the weak double layers (WDLs) observed in the solar wind at 1 AU by Wind spacecraft in terms of slow ion-acoustic double layers. It is proposed that both slow and fast ion-acoustic solitons may be responsible for the ion- acoustic like wave activity in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "The ESCIN-3.1 profile was acquired in 1993 offshore northwest Galicia (Spain), and recorded 20 s of near vertical reflection seismic data. This 140 km long profile was intended to provide an image of the crustal structure of this sector of the continental margin from near the coastline to the deep-sea area. The tectonic evolution of the northwest Galicia margin initiated by rifting during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times and progressed to sea floor spreading during Albian- Late Cretaceous times when the Bay of Biscay opened. Subsequently, the margin was active during the convergence of Eurasia and Iberia in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene.\nHere we present a new interpretation of the mentioned profile based on a newly reprocessed depth migrated image and corresponding gravity model. In the deep-sea areas, a free-air gravity low reach up to - 120 mGal and the sea bottom is at more than 5000 m deep. The 7 km thick flat lying undisturbed sedimentary cover appears above a 10 km thick, ~120 Ma old oceanic basement. This flat sediments onlap toward the ocean-continent transition on a folded and disturbed 20 km long wedge shaped sedimentary body. A major landward dipping structure reaches from the foot of the slope to beneath the sub horizontal Moho of the continental slope. The slope has a gentle dip of about 2° in this section, and include large mass flow deposits. Fault bound sediments are imaged in the upper continental margin that could correspond to preserved syn-rift Mesozoic structures. The structure of what correspond to the continental basement in the thicker part of the margin is not well resolved. Only in the landward side of the profile a layered lower crust is seen where the Moho reaches depths of 29 km.\nThe ocean-continent transition in this profile may be interpreted as that of an active compressional boundary with some accretion of deep-sea sediments that are underthrust by a thinned continental margin with large submarine landslides and mass flow deposits evidence of the massive failure along the continental slope.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria are considered to be microaerophilic and most commonly live near or below the Fe-redox boundary. However, common occurrence of magnetofossils in Pacific red clay (Yamazaki and Shimono, 2013), which contains abundant dissolved oxygen and does not have a Fe-redox boundary, suggest that some species of magnetotactic bacteria live in an environment without a strong chemical gradient. To contribute to better understanding of the ecology of magnetotactic bacteria in deep-sea sediments, we have studied magnetofossils within surface sediments of the Japan Sea, where the Fe-redox boundary is known to occur several to tens of centimeters below the seafloor, with rock-magnetic techniques and TEM observations. Undisturbed surface sediments were taken with a multiple corer. From dissolved oxygen and Fe (II) contents of interstitial water and color reflectance of the sediments, the Fe-redox boundary was clearly detected at 7 to 25 cm below the seafloor at three sites. In the component analyses of IRM acquisition curves, a magnetic component that has a mean coercivity of ~65 mT and a small dispersion parameter occurs, which corresponds to the biogenic hard (BH) component of Egli (2004). At all three sites, the proportion of this component increases just below the Fe-redox boundary, which is associated with an increase in the ratio of ARM to SIRM. These results suggest increased abundance of magnetofossils with elongated morphologies like hexagonal prism and tear drop. On the other hand, FORC diagrams show sharp central ridges indicative of magnetofossils throughout the sediment columns regardless of the distance from the Fe-redox boundary, even at the sediment-water interface. The occurrence of magnetofossils was confirmed by TEM observations. These results suggest that although some species of magnetotactic bacteria living in marine sediments prefer a chemical condition near the Fe-redox boundary, others may be aerotolerant and live in oxic environments.",

            "abstract": "Snow on sea ice is a relevant polar climate parameter related to ocean-atmospheric interactions and surface albedo. It also remains an important factor for sea-ice thickness products retrieved from Ku-band satellite radar altimeters like Envisat or CryoSat-2, which is currently on its mission and the subject of many recent studies. Such satellites sense the height of the sea-ice surface above the sea level, which is called sea-ice freeboard. By assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and that the main scattering horizon is given by the snow-ice interface, the freeboard can be transformed into sea-ice thickness. Therefore, information about the snow load on hemispherical scale is crucial. Due to the lack of sufficient satellite products, only climatological values are used in current studies. Since such values do not represent the high variability of snow distribution in the Arctic, they can be a substantial contributor to the total sea-ice thickness uncertainty budget. Secondly, recent studies suggest that the snow layer cannot be considered as homogenous, but possibly rather featuring a complex stratigraphy due to wind compaction and/or ice lenses. Therefore, the Ku-band radar signal can be scattered at internal layers, causing a shift of the main scattering horizon towards the snow surface. This alters the freeboard and thickness retrieval as the assumption that the main scattering horizon is given by the snow-ice interface is no longer valid and introduces a bias.\nHere, we present estimates for the impact of snow depth uncertainties and snow properties on CryoSat-2 sea-ice thickness retrievals. We therefore compare CryoSat-2 freeboard measurements with field data from ice mass-balance buoys and aircraft campaigns from the CryoSat Validation Experiment. This unique validation dataset includes airborne laser scanner and radar altimeter measurements in spring coincident to CryoSat-2 overflights, and allows us to evaluate how the main scattering horizon is altered by the presence of a complex snow stratigraphy.",

            "abstract": "The coupling frequency of once per day that is used in most CGCMs contributing to IPCC AR5 will become inadequate when increasing spatial resolutions of CGCMs contributing to the coming AR6. In this study, we analyze the changes in the air-sea fluxes of the momentum, heat and fresh water flux caused by increasing the coupling frequency from once per day to once per hour using the Max-Planck Institute Earth System Model. We focus on changes in the mean, the variance and the extremes of these fluxes. We diagnose the role of the averaging and high-frequency feedbacks on these changes and identify a feedback loop involving the fluxes.\nWe found that the mean of the momentum-flux magnitude is decreased up to -7% in the tropics and increased up to 10\\% in the Southern Ocean. These changes result solely from feedbacks between atmosphere and ocean occurring on time scales shorter than a day. The variance and extremes of all the fluxes are intensified in most part of the oceans. Exceptions are found for the momentum and fresh water fluxes in the tropics. The increases result mainly from the average procedure, while the decreases in the tropics are caused by the high-frequency feedbacks. The variance increases are substantial, reaching up to 50% for the momentum flux, 100% for the fresh water flux, and factor 15 for the net heat flux. These diurnal and intra-diurnal variations account for up to 50% to 90% of the total variances and exhibit distinct seasonality.\nThe diurnal cycle of net heat flux accounted only in hourly coupled experiment increases the meridional gradient of SST of the Southern Ocean. The atmospheric circulation responds to the increased meridional gradient of SST by a increase in the westerly wind stress, which in turn cools the in situ SST. The feedback suggests that increasing coupling frequency can lead to systematic changes in the air-sea general circulation.",

            "abstract": "Coverage rate, a critical variable for gridded forest area, has been neglected by previous studies in estimating the annual gross primary production (GPP) of global forest ecosystems. In this study, based on forest ecosystem carbon budget model for china (FORCCHN), we investigated to what extent the coverage rate could impact forest GPP estimates from 1982 to 2011. Here we show that the traditional calculation without considering the coverage rate globally overestimated the forest gross carbon dioxide uptake by approximately 8.7%, with a value of 5.12±0.23Pg C yr-1, which is equivalent to 48% of the annual emissions from anthropogenic activities in 2012. Actually, by taking the coverage rate into account, the global annual GPP of forest ecosystems is approximately 53.71±4.83Pg C yr-1 for the past 30 years with 46.19±4.24Pg C yr-1 for forest grids and 7.52±1.59Pg C yr-1 for non-forest grids. Accordingly, we argue that forest annual GPP calculated by previous studies has been overestimated due to the exaggerated forest area, and therefore, coverage rate may be a required factor to further quantify the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "In the flood forecasting practice, model performance is usually degraded due to various sources of uncertainties, including the uncertainties from input data, model parameters, model structures and output observations. Data assimilation is a useful methodology to reduce uncertainties in flood forecasting. For the short-term flood forecasting, an accurate estimation of initial soil moisture condition will improve the forecasting performance. Considering the time delay of runoff routing is another important effect for the forecasting performance. Moreover, the observation data of hydrological variables (including ground observations and satellite observations) are becoming easily available. The reliability of the short-term flood forecasting could be improved by assimilating multi-source data. The objective of this study is to develop a multi-source data assimilation framework for real-time flood forecasting.\nIn this data assimilation framework, the first step is assimilating the up-layer soil moisture observations to update model state and generated runoff based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method, and the second step is assimilating discharge observations to update model state and runoff within a fixed time window based on the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) method. This smoothing technique is adopted to account for the runoff routing lag. Using such assimilation framework of the soil moisture and discharge observations is expected to improve the flood forecasting. In order to distinguish the effectiveness of this dual-step assimilation framework, we designed a dual-EnKF algorithm in which the observed soil moisture and discharge are assimilated separately without accounting for the runoff routing lag. The results show that the multi-source data assimilation framework can effectively improve flood forecasting, especially when the runoff routing has a distinct time lag. Thus, this new data assimilation framework holds a great potential in operational flood forecasting by merging observations from ground measurement and remote sensing retrivals.",

            "abstract": "Texturally well-preserved volcanic debris flows (also called lahars) are exposed in the Latest Paleozoic Arbasay Formation, Northern Tian Shan. LA-ICP-MS zircon dating of the intercalated fallout tuff sample provided an age of 314.4±3.4 Ma (MSWD=1.6), suggesting they were deposited at Latest Carboniferous. The lahars consist primarily of two lithofacies: massive, poorly lithified diamictites and stratified, moderately lithified gravelly sandstones. The diamictites can be generally divided into two subfacies, i.e., the matrix-supported and the clast-supported diamictites. Most diamictites are structureless and nongraded. They are thick in beds and contain large clasts up to 3 m in dimension. The gravelly sandstones display much finer particle size and have wedge or lenticular geometries. Large clasts are absent within them and the sorting characters are much better than the diamictites. Despite the different size grading, the matrix and the clasts of the two lithofacies appear to be homogeneous. The matrix is generally sandy mudstone. The clasts comprise rhyolites, dacites, andesites, andesitic basalts and basalts, same to the co-existing volcanic rocks, suggesting they originate from the cognate volcanics. The disorganized diamictites are supposed to deposit from a turbulent flood or pyroclastic surge. The gravelly sandstone lithofacies are interpreted as sand-rich flood flows or hyperconcentrated flood flows during the waning stage of a mass-flow event. The overall characteristics of the deposits suggest a mass-flow dominated alluvial fan environment. It’s noteable that several syn- sedimentary normal faults occurred within these lahar deposits, indicating that the Southern Junggar Basin was in an extensional regime during the lahars’ deposition. Structure is dominated by normal faulting, allowing the existence of relatively small, highly compartmentalized depocenters. This is also supported by geochemistry and detrital zircon studies.",

We use a tank filled with glass beads to simulate this process in a simplified laboratory experiment. A sprinkler pipe generates rain, which infiltrates into the porous material. Groundwater exits this laboratory aquifer through one side of the tank. The resulting water discharge increases rapidly during rainfall, and decays slowly after the rain has stopped.\nA theoretical analysis based on Darcy's law and the shallow-water approximation reveals two asymptotic regimes. At the beginning of a rain event, the water discharge increases linearly with time, with a slope proportional to the rainfall rate at the power of 3/2. Long after the rain has stopped, it decreases as the inverse time squared, as predicted by Polubarinova-Kochina (1962). These predictions compare well against our experimental data.\nField measurements from two distinct catchments exhibit the same asymptotic behaviours as our experiment. This observation suggests that, despite the simplicity of the setup, our experimental results could be extended to natural groundwater flows.",

            "abstract": "Vast portions of Arctic and sub-Arctic Siberia, Alaska and the Yukon Territory are covered by ice-rich silts that are penetrated by large ice wedges, resulting from syngenetic sedimentation and freezing. Accompanied by wedge-ice growth, the sedimentation process was driven by cold continental climatic and environmental conditions in unglaciated regions during the late Pleistocene, inducing the accumulation of the unique Yedoma permafrost deposits up to 50 meter thick.\nBecause of fast incorporation of organic material into permafrost during formation, Yedoma deposits include low-decomposed organic matter. Moreover, ice-rich permafrost deposits like Yedoma are especially prone to degradation triggered by climate changes or human activity. When Yedoma deposits degrade, large amounts of sequestered organic carbon as well as other nutrients are released and become part of active biogeochemical cycling. This could be of global significance for the climate warming, as increased permafrost thaw is likely to cause a positive feedback loop. Therefore, a detailed assessment of the Yedoma deposit volume is of importance to estimate its potential future climate response. Moreover, as a step beyond the objectives of this synthesis study, our coverage (see figure for the Yedoma domain) and thickness estimation will provide critical data to refine the Yedoma permafrost organic carbon inventory, which is assumed to have freeze-locked between 83±12 and 129±30 gigatonnes (Gt) of organic carbon.\nHence, we here synthesize data on the circum-Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and thickness of Yedoma permafrost (see figure for the Yedoma domain) in the framework of an Action Group funded by the International Permafrost Association (IPA). The quantification of the Yedoma coverage is conducted by the digitization of geomorphological and Quaternary geological maps. Further data on Yedoma thickness is contributed from boreholes and exposures reported in the scientific literature.",

            "abstract": "The rare earth element (REE) composition of bioapatite has long been used as a proxy for ancient seawater chemistry and paleomarine environmental reconstruction, based on the assumption of preservation of a hydrogenous (seawater-derived) REE signal. Recent work, however, has begun to question the provenance of REEs in conodonts, emphasizing the importance of REEs released by the lithogenous fraction of the sediment and subsequently adsorbed onto conodont apatite in the burial environment. Here, we investigate patterns of REE and trace-element abundance in conodonts and their host sediments from the Early to Late Ordovician Huanghuachang and Chenjiahe sections of Hubei Province, South China. Several lines of evidence indicate that REEs in the conodont samples were acquired mainly from clay minerals in the host sediment during burial diagenesis: (1) REEs in conodonts show a strong positive correlation to Th and other lithogenic elements; (2) conodonts and whole-rock samples show general patterns of REE and trace-element enrichment that are highly similar to each other and bear no resemblance to seawater elemental concentrations; (3) similar patterns are observed in Triassic conodonts and whole-rock samples; and (4) Y/Ho ratios in conodonts are mostly <40 (mean ~33), values that are consistent with derivation of >90% of REEs from lithogenous sources. Conodonts show pronounced middle rare earth element (MREE) enrichment, a pattern that is unambiguously of diagenetic origin owing to its association with lower Y/Ho ratios. With increasing MREE enrichment of conodont samples, U concentrations and LaN/YbN ratios shift from high to low, and Mn concentrations from low to high. These patterns suggest that conodont diagenesis was initiated at shallow burial depths under suboxic conditions (i.e., in the zone of Mn(IV) and Fe(III) reduction) but continued at greater burial depths, with most acquisition of secondary REEs at later diagenetic stages. Our findings indicate that (1) conodont apatite frequently does not preserve a recognizable hydrogenous REE signal, and (2) the results of many earlier studies in which REEs in bioapatite were used as a paleo-seawater proxy may need re-evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Abstract\nMany conventional hard flood risk alleviation schemes have been detrimental to natural geomorphic processes and have damaged fluvial habitats. This is primarily due to the over-riding focus on managing flood risk by dictating channel capacity and hydraulics, which is not always conducive to the promotion of geomorphologically-healthy and diverse conditions that allow and promote natural processes.\nThis paper explains how the principles of fluvial geomorphology had a large influence on the design, construction and post project monitoring of a flood alleviation scheme in Wales within a heavily confined river corridor that is designated as having special ecological status; without adversely impacting on flood risk.\nThe challenge was to ensure that the physical habitat required by the important species (including Atlantic Salmon and Ranunculus) were retained and that the surrounding infrastructure and properties were not at risk of being undercut as a result of scour in the confined high energy channel. A geomorphologically-guided soft engineering approach was taken to promote local morphological diversity and flow diversity, utilising information from up and downstream natural river reaches, and general geomorphological principles. The proposed layout was modelled in 1D to understand the effects of the reprofiling on flows, allowing for a basic assessment of coarse sediment transport to be undertaken. A combination of terrestrial laser scanning and contact GPS surveys were used to monitor morphological evolution post construction, and to determine how morphological form adjusted post-construction within the confined channel.\nThis paper will introduce the guiding principles of process restoration that influenced scheme design, and then report on the morphological evolution of the river channel that occurred as river processes produced and maintained a dynamic, diverse and healthy physical habitat.\nKeywords: Process Restoration; Form Process Feedbacks; Fluvial Geomorphology; Flood Risk Management; Terrestrial Laser Scanning; Morphological monitoring,; DTM; SSSI; Salmon; Ranunculus; Environmental Engineering.",

            "abstract": "The surfaces of bodies without atmospheres, including Mercury, are covered with a layer of regolith, fragmental, heterogeneous material formed due to meteoritic impacts on more coherent substrate material. Among the regolith-related characteristic morphologies observed on the Moon are distinctive small fresh impact craters with 1) flat floors, 2) single knobs on their floors, 3) double-rings. These morphologies are interpreted to indicate the penetration down to more coherent material below the fragmental regolith, for example lava flows in the lunar maria, and can be used to estimate the thickness of the regolith (Quaide & Oberbeck 1968 JGR 73, 5247). We found about 150 small craters of similar morphologies as the result of a survey of more than 1600 high-resolution images obtained by MESSENGER’s MDIS NAC camera in the northern high latitudes, and we inferred the regolith thickness using the method of Bart (2014 Icarus 235, 130). These estimates indicate that the regolith on Mercury is significantly thicker than on the Moon. Our analysis showed that the small craters with flat floors are mostly confined to Mercury’s smooth plains, which have been interpreted as features of volcanic origin (Denevi et al. 2013 JGR 118, 891). Smooth plains are likely to be characterized by a relatively sharp boundary between the regolith and underlying bedrock; association with smooth plains is consistent with a regolith-related origin for the specific crater morphologies. Using stereo pairs of MDIS NAC images we created DEMs with a resolution of 30 m/pix using PHOTOMOD software for several sites on Mercury’s surface. The depth of several flat-floored craters measured using these DEMs also indicates a thick regolith layer on Mercury. This technique can be used to estimate regolith thickness, and detect plains of volcanic origin, during the ESA BepiColombo mission.

            "abstract": "By combining geophysical and petrological information, we investigate the crust and upper mantle of three orogens of the Alpine-Himalayan Belt (Atlas, Zagros and Tibet), characterizing the lithosphere from the thermal, compositional and seismological viewpoint. The modeling is based on an integrated geophysical-petrological methodology combining elevation, gravity, geoid, surface heat flow, seismic and geochemical data.\nThe results show prominent lithospheric mantle thickening beneath the Moroccan margin followed by thinning beneath the Atlas Mountains. Different convergence accommodation between the crust and lithospheric mantle suggests a decoupled crustal‐mantle mechanical response. In the northern Zagros the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary rises sharply below the Sanandaj Sirjan Zone in a narrow region, whereas in the central Zagros the thinning is smoother and affects a wider region. The transition from the Arabian to the Eurasian lithospheric domain is located beneath the Zagros range, and it is marked by a change in the mantle velocity anomaly and in the lithospheric mantle composition. In the western Himalaya-Tibetan orogen, the lithosphere thickening is gradual reaching the maximum below the northern edge of the Plateau. The Indian lithospheric mantle underlies the whole Tibetan Plateau up to the boundary with the Tarim Basin. In the eastern sector, the thickening generates sharp steps beneath the Himalaya Range, and it thins abruptly beneath the Qiangtang and the Songpan Ganzi terrains. The Indian underthrusting is restricted to the southern Plateau. Different Eurasian domains have been also identified beneath the Tarim Basin, the Altaids region and NE Plateau by means of different lithospheric mantle compositions. The lithospheric models crossing Zagros and Tibetan Plateau show that the present-day lithosphere mantle structure of the Arabia-Eurasia and India-Eurasia collision zones are laterally-varying along the strike of both orogens, not just in terms of crust and lithospheric mantle thickness, but also in mantle density, temperature and composition. These models show that the three studied ranges (Atlas, Zagros and Himalaya-Tibet) are characterized by the presence of crustal roots, but not necessarily underlain by lithospheric mantle roots.",

            "abstract": "In the spring of 2014, some members of the media expressed excitement about an impending large El Nino episode that may rival the 1997-98 extreme event. As summer and fall of 2014 arrived, however, the typical tropical atmospheric response to El Nino had not materialized, and a large El Nino episode did not occur in either the fall or winter of 2014-15. This study examines the reasons why the atmosphere did not respond in the expected manner, with a focus on a diagnosis of atmospheric stability. Analyses of profiles of equivalent potential temperature (θe) and saturation equivalent potential temperature (θes) in key regions of ocean/atmosphere coupling suggest that the spring of 2014 was characterized by unusually stable air despite oceanic conditions that were conducive for El Nino development. In a retrospective forecasting context for predictions made in March, April or May 2014, a multiple linear regression model that uses both eastern Pacific oceanic heat content and a measure of atmospheric stability as predictors predicted a low probability of an extreme El Nino in 2014-15, with probabilities substantially lower than if the regression model uses eastern Pacific oceanic heat content alone. This study places the conditions in the spring of 2014 in a historical context and contrasts them with the spring of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater fish are frequently the focus of river management, and rising water temperature (Tw) has the potential to negatively influence the suitability of habitats for many species, including salmonids. Consequently, an improved understanding of spatial and temporal variability in Tw is required at the river basin, hydrometric region and national scales concurrent with the scales at which management decisions are made. The Scotland River Temperature Monitoring Network (SRTMN) was designed to record Tw variability across the observed environmental range of a suite of landscape characteristics. These characteristics act as proxies for controls known to affect heat and water exchange processes. This national-scale monitoring network provides quality controlled data that enables the scaling up of small-scale process understanding to larger spatial scales. This dataset provided the input to statistical models which were used to investigate controls on summary metrics describing Tw and to predict future change. Following model selection procedures, the most significant and influential variables were found to vary seasonally and in relation to the temperature metric being described, reflecting the time varying importance of landscape controls and their influence on energy exchange processes. The presence of riparian woodland was a significant control on temperature that is also amenable to management control. Future work will focus on applying these models to unmonitored locations and highlighting sensitive areas where riparian management (planting or protecting woodland) could be beneficial to reduce the risks of potentially damaging high temperatures. This large-scale scientific understanding will be important for informing the management of Scottish rivers under a changing climate.",

It is found that the AM may migrate compensatively among these three types of surfaces on interannual time scales. There are two pairs of strong anti-phase relations. The one is in zonal between Eurasian continent and mid-latitude Pacific (referred to as EPAR), which is a teleconnection pattern characterizing with two strong correlation centers respectively over Eurasia and North Pacific. The other anti-phase relation of AM, referred to as OIAR, is found in meridional between ice-covered Arctic and water oceans including Atlantic and Pacific. In the context of OIAR, two teleconnection patterns are found. One is MANP, which merges as three strong correlation centers respectively over the Mediterranean, Arctic, and North Pacific when AM fluctuates over water oceans. Another is MAEA, which characterizes with three strong correlation centers respectively around the Mediterranean, Arctic, and East Asia when AM fluctuates over the ice-covered Arctic. The MAEA looks largely different from MANP in anomalous surface air pressure over the northwest Pacific. These teleconnections including MANP, MAEA, and EPAR are resulted from thermal contrasts among the three types of surfaces. Rossby waves and vertical circulations play important roles in forming these teleconnection patterns. Interestingly, these teleconnections may significantly influence the winter climate widely in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in regions around the Mediterranean, the northern part of Eurasia, parts of North America, and East Asia.",

A commercial centrifuge has been equipped with a slip-ring so that electric power, temperature and ultrasonic signals could be transmitted between the experimental setup and the laboratory. A Peltier element provides cooling at the bottom of the cell. Probes monitor the temperature along the height of the cell. Ultrasound measurements (2 to 6 MHz) is used to detect the position of the front of the mushy zone and to determine attenuation in the mush. A significant increase of solid fraction (or decrease of mushy layer thickness) and attenuation in the mush is observed as gravity is increased. Kinetic undercooling is significant in our experiments and has been included in a macroscopic mush model. The other ingredients of the model are conservation of energy and chemical species, along with heat/species transfer between the mush and the liquid phase: boundary-layer exchanges at the top of the mush and bulk convection within the mush (formation of chimneys). The outputs of the model compare well with our experiments. We have then run the model in a range of parameters suitable for the Earth's inner core, which has shown the role of bulk mush convection for the inner core and the reason why a solid fraction very close to unity should be expected. We have also run melting experiments: after crystallization of a mush, the liquid has been heated from above until the mush started to melt, while the bottom cold temperature was maintained. These melting experiments were motivated by the possible local melting at the inner core boundary that has been invoked to explain the formation of the anomalously slow F-layer at the bottom of the outer core or inner core hemispherical asymmetry. Oddly, the consequences of melting are an increase in solid fraction and a decrease in attenuation. It is hence possible that surface seismic velocity and attenuation of the inner core are strongly affected by melting.",

            "abstract": "Glacially fed hydropower reservoirs in the Swiss Alps have experienced substantial increases in sedimentation recently. This sedimenation causes reduced reservoir capacity, turbine abrasion and increased need for sediment flushing, all of which reduce the e\u000eciency and economic viability of hydropower in the region. Although the issue is largely attributed to regional glacier retreat, there is a need for greater understanding of the speci c processes that contribute to the increased sedimentation.\nTo evaluate these processes, we examine the Griesgletscher catchment, which lies in the central Swiss Alps and its runoff feeds a hydropower reservoir. The recent exposure of the glacier's fore-fi eld (roughly 1986) due to the glacier's retreat beyond the reservoir's margin, along with its simple catchment area make it an ideal location to examine pro-glacial erosion. Here we present a time-series from 1986 to 2014 of digital elevation models (DEM) created from aerial photographs of the Griesgletscher's fore- field from each year except for 2. Comparison of DEMs from subsequent years yields erosion volumes and sediment balance over the 28 year period for the pro-glacial area. Bathymetry of the pro-glacial reservoir for select years allows us to speculate if the erosion of the recently exposed glacier fore-fi eld is the sole source of sediment to the reservoir, or if alternative processes such as increased glacial erosion or mobilization of sub-glacial sediments could contribute. We correlate erosion amounts with runo ff volumes from the Griesgletscher and changes in the the glacier's morophology and coverage. Additionally, implimentation of the Glacier Evolution Runoff Model allows us to examine the variability in the glacier's runoff on the hourly to daily scale. By examining these relationships we constrain the processes contributing to the erosion of the Griesgletscher's pro-glacial area.",

            "abstract": "It is still largely unclear how nutrients that travel through the catchment-river system are distributed within estuaries. How long will nutrients remain in the estuary, and what proportion will disperse offshore into the oceans? In the UK, where many catchments are relatively small and steep, estuaries react rapidly to rainfall events, which crucially control the mixing process, even though tidal stirring is generally large. Seasonal and short-term variability in estuarine functioning is therefore greater than variabilities over semi-diurnal timescales linked to tidal cycling.\nWe present both published and on-going research that is emerging from an interdisciplinary pan-UK NERC Macronutrient Cycles Programme (macronutrient-cycles.ouce.ox.ac.uk). We pull together intensive field campaigns (Howlett et al. 2015) and model simulations (Robins et al. 2015), and present for the first time coupled simulations of catchment-river-estuary nutrient transport, using a variety of hydrological and hydrodynamic models. We investigate the response of the hydrodynamics and nutrients to extreme flows and storm surge events, and the response to climate change by simulating the IPCC 5th Assessment projections for 2100. On-going research will extend this integrated approach into the macronutrient controls on atmospheric-land exchange.\nEmerging research from our UK case study suggests that simulating the hourly river hydrograph, rather than daily-averaged, is important for estuarine response and recovery; daily-averaged flowrates, which are commonly used, under-predict the offshore transport of nutrients. Moreover, biogeochemical processing, whilst detected over estuarine residence times, did not measurably alter the estuarine concentrations, due to the much stronger advective fluxes. By simulating past mean and extreme events, using time-series analysis of river flow and tidal level data collected over the past 50 years, we are able to characterise the future estuarine nutrient response due to climate change in terms of sea-level rise, and future rainfall and storm surge climatologies.",

            "abstract": "We present a new, high-order, control-volume-finite-element (CVFE) method with discontinuous representation for pressure and velocity to simulate multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media. Time is discretized using an adaptive, fully implicit method. Heterogeneous geologic features are represented as volumes bounded by surfaces. Within these volumes, termed geologic domains, the material properties are constant. A given model typically contains numerous such geologic domains. Our approach conserves mass and does not require the use of CVs that span domain boundaries. Computational efficiency is increased by use of dynamic mesh optimization, in which an unstructured mesh adapts in space and time to key solution fields, such as pressure, velocity or saturation, whilst preserving the geometry of the geologic domains. Up-, cross- or down-scaling of material properties during mesh optimization is not required, as the properties are uniform within each geologic domain. We demonstrate that the approach, amongst other features, accurately preserves sharp saturation changes associated with high aspect ratio geologic domains such as fractures and mudstones, allowing efficient simulation of flow in highly heterogeneous models. Moreover, accurate solutions are obtained at significantly lower computational cost than an equivalent fine, fixed mesh and conventional CVFE methods. The use of implicit time integration allows the method to efficiently converge using highly anisotropic meshes without having to reduce the time-step. The work is significant for two key reasons. First, it resolves a long-standing problem associated with the use of classical CVFE methods to model flow in highly heterogeneous porous media, in which CVs span boundaries between domains of contrasting material properties. Second, it reduces computational cost/increases solution accuracy through the use of dynamic mesh optimization and time-stepping with large Courant number.",

We partition the uncertainty of future temperature and precipitation in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 experiments into Epistemic (structural or model dependent), Aleatoric (chaotic or initial condition dependent), and Reflexive (scenario dependent) components. For this, a subset of 8 models is selected on the basis of availability of more than three realizations from each model. Our results indicate that while there are regions and seasons with large model dependent uncertainty, in many instances the Aleatoric uncertainty component exceeds it. We also address the question whether using appropriate performance metric based weighting for individual models can reduce structural uncertainty. We explore combinations of metrics across variables (and multiple observational datasets where available) and phenomena that matter for the different regional climatic zones to weight models and examine the resulting uncertainty range.",

Sedimentary basins overlying key locations of the resulting fold-thrust belt that was metamorphosed to varying grades, may help to quantitatively kinematically restore the subduction evolution, and to identify timing, directions and amounts of post-accretionary extension, shortening and strike-slip faulting.\nThe Upper Cretaceous - Oligocene Ulukışla basin straddles ophiolites, underlain by the HT-LP metamorphic Kırşehir Block (KB) to its north, and the HP-LT Bolkardağ/Afyon zone (BA) to its south. At its southern margin a series of small-offset faults consistent with latest Cretaceous-Paleocene N-S extension, was contemporaneous with (presumably extensional) exhumation of BA. Close to the contact with KB, a series of large-offset listric normal faults compatible with E-W extension offsets sediments and the base of newly dated Paleocene volcanics, showing E-W extension simultaneous with N-S extension in the south, prevailing until at least 56 Ma. Subsequently, N-S directed contraction led to E-W striking folds and thrusts and back-thrusting of the BA over the Ulukisla basin, probably in Oligocene time, and coeval left lateral strike-slip motion along the Ecemiş fault (EF) at the eastern basin margin. We explain the interplay between two Late Cretaceous-Paleocene extension directions to result from interplay between N-S and E-W striking subduction segments in central and eastern Anatolia, respectively. The latter can be followed farther east towards the Bitlis. In addition, absence of a Kirsehir block in eastern Anatolia led to a much longer duration of subduction below the Pontides, throughout the Paleogene and perhaps until as young as the Middle Miocene, with a suture below the Sivas basin that covers the contact between the KB, the Pontides and the Taurides. We restore an amount of Cenozoic convergence across the Sivas basin at least equal to ~300 km shortening restored in Central Anatolia, 60-75 km displacement along the EF. Counter-clockwise Cenozoic rotation of the Taurides relative to the Pontides, documented paleomagnetically, may further increase this convergence with several hundreds of kilometers.",

            "abstract": "The study of dust fluxes in the Southern Ocean (SO) is crucial to understand processes and feedback mechanisms in the SO since atmospheric dust is considered to play a key role in past atmospheric CO2 variability by affecting the marine biological production through iron fertilization. We present 230Thxs, isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb) and REE data of numerous surface samples across the Pacific sector of the SO in order to determine lithogenic mass accumulation rates (MAR) (corrected for sediment focusing) and possible dust provenance areas. Our MAR data display highest values near New Zealand´s east coast (South Island), however this may not reflect a pure Australian/New Zealand dust signal due to a strong influence of fluvial sediment input from New Zealand sources. In contrast, we interpret the open ocean MAR values as derived from the Australian/New Zealand dust plume, which might reach as far east as ~100° W. The highest MAR values among the open ocean samples are found south of the winter sea ice front (WSI), and likely reflect the admixture of ice rafted debris (IRD). Further east of ~100° W, the MAR data exceed the open ocean samples by up to a factor of ~6, consistent with predominating terrigenous input from southernmost Patagonia and Antarctica. Combining the MAR data set with provenance sensitive proxies (isotopic and REE data) enables us to identify at least 3 different possible provenance areas (Australia/New Zealand, Antarctica and Patagonia) and to reconstruct the possible pathway of the Australian/New Zealand dust plume. Since the atmospheric circulation (westerly winds) is one controlling factor influencing the distribution of dust over the SO this data set also allows us to infer variations of wind speed and strength of the westerly wind belt.",

Changes in stream hydrology resulting from urbanization causes a widening gap between river and neighborhoods that results in the ecological and visual division between built and natural environments. To address these problems, a new management perspective in Tehran municipality seeks creating a sequence of thematic green spaces which serve as meeting points for adjacent neighborhoods. Implementation of pilot projects has proved that restoration of urban rivers requires a holistic approach with a range of technologies and tools that contribute to the goal of integrated planning. Currently, our team is working on Darband and Darabad catchments in north east Tehran,to provide opportunities for restoration of natural life in order to improve the amenity, ecology and sustainability of an urban river environment based on 4 key planning principles of: Demonstrating characteristics of the city’s unique relationship to the river in the riverfront design; Knowing the river ecosystem and planning for a scale larger than the river front; minimizing new floodplain development; and Providing public access, connections, and recreational uses. This presentation will discuss the process of developing a new integrated GIS-based catchment planning system which helped the City shape its strategic plan for two catchments for the 2015-2030 period through multi-objective and multi-criteria optimization. The strategic plan is expected to enable the city to project the effects of introducing any future development in the catchment area on the river system, helping it to prevent such development activities which can have unintended long-term impacts.",

The kinematics of CMEs can\nchange when they interact or collide with each other as they propagate in the heliosphere. The knowledge about nature of collision of CMEs can be utilized to predict their post-collision kinematics and relatively accurate arrival time at the Earth. To calculate the coefficient of restitution for the colliding CMEs, we need to estimate the propagation and expansion speeds, impact direction and the masses of the CMEs. Although, these parameters could be derived from heliospheric imaging observations, but have large uncertainties. In the present study, we have thoroughly discussed the uncertainties involved in the calculation of coefficient of restitution. Our results suggest that calculated value of coefficient of restitution, from mere use of kinematics from STEREO/COR and HI observations, should also be validated with simulation before making a reliable conclusion for nature of collision for the CMEs. We also highlight the significance of HI observations in studying CME–CME collision for the purpose of improved space weather forecasting.",

Forecasts issued include arrival times of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and probabilistic forecasts for flares, geomagnetic storm indices, and energetic particle fluxes and fluences. These forecasts are produced twice daily using a combination of output from models such as Enlil, near-real-time observations, and forecaster experience.\nVerification of forecasts is crucial for users, researchers, and forecasters to understand the strengths and limitations of forecasters, and to assess forecaster added value. To this end, the Met Office (in collaboration with Exeter University) has been adapting verification techniques from terrestrial weather, and has been working closely with the International Space Environment Service (ISES) to standardise verification procedures.\nWe will present the results of part of this work, analysing forecast and observed CME arrival times, assessing skill using 2x2 contingency tables. These MOSWOC forecasts can be objectively compared to those produced by the NASA Community Coordinated Modelling Center - a useful benchmark.\nThis approach cannot be taken for the other forecasts, as they are probabilistic and categorical (e.g., geomagnetic storm forecasts give probabilities of exceeding levels from minor to extreme). We will present appropriate verification techniques being developed to address these forecasts, such as rank probability skill score, and comparing forecasts against climatology and persistence benchmarks. As part of this, we will outline the use of discrete time Markov chains to assess and improve the performance of our geomagnetic storm forecasts.\nWe will also discuss work to adapt a terrestrial verification visualisation system to space weather, to help MOSWOC forecasters view verification results in near real-time; plans to objectively assess flare forecasts under the EU Horizon 2020 FLARECAST project; and summarise ISES efforts to achieve consensus on verification.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide is the main component of the dry gas phase in hydrothermal and volcanic fluids, being mainly produced by mantle degassing and thermometamorphic reactions on limestone at which a shallow contribution from microbial activity is commonly added. These three different sources can be recognized on the basis of the d13C values, since biogenic CO2 typically shows an isotopic signature significantly more negative (<-20‰ V-PDB) than that originated at depth (>-7‰ V-PDB). Intermediate d13C values are commonly interpreted as due to mixing processes between deep and shallow sources. In this study, the d13C values of CO2 and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) in thermal waters from distinct hydrothermal/volcanic systems, located in Italy (Campi Flegrei and Vulcano Island) and Chilean Andes (El Tatio), are reported. This dataset includes several carbon isotopic ratios that are not consistent with a pure shallow or deep CO2 origin. Nevertheless the relatively high CO2 concentrations and the water chemistry of these samples clearly indicate that they are not resulting by mixing between the deep and shallow end-members. Calcite deposition, which produces a strong isotopic fractionation on the pristine CO2, seems to represent a reliable alternative explanation for the observed data. It is worth noting that these peculiar isotopic and chemical features have recurrently been recognized in thermal water discharges from different volcanic areas. These results demonstrate that the release of CO2 from primary sources is strongly affected by secondary processes since they act as sinks of CO2. As a consequence, they play an important role for the evaluation of the global budget of CO2 discharged from these natural systems.",

Due to its importance, the strength of the AMOC is continually monitored along 26ºN with several moorings east of the Bahamas, in the Middle Atlantic Ridge and south of the Canary islands, known as the RAPID array. The measurements of the RAPID array show a 6 Sv seasonal cycle for the AMOC, and recent studies have pointed out the dynamics of the eastern Atlantic as the main driver for this seasonal cycle, specifically, rossby waves excited south of the Canary Islands. Due to the important role of the eastern Atlantic, in this study we describe the seasonal cycle of the Canary Current (CC) and the Canary Upwelling Current (CUC) using hydrographic data from two cruises carried out in a box around the Canary Islands, the region where the eastern component of the RAPID array is placed. CTD, VMADCP and LADCP data were combined with inverse modeling in order to determine absolute geostrophic transports in the Canary Islands region in fall and spring. During spring, the overall transport of Canary Current and the CUC was southward. In the Lanzarote Passage (LP), between the Canary Islands and Africa, the CUC transported 0.6±0.20 Sv southward, while the Canary Current transported 1.0±0.40 Sv in the oceanic waters of the Canary Islands Archipelago. During fall, the CUC transported 2.8±0.4Sv northward, while the CC transported 2.9±0.60 Sv southward in the oceanic waters of the Canary Islands Archipelago. The seasonal cycle observed has an amplitude of 3.4Sv for the CUC and 1.9Sv for the CC. Data from a mooring in the LP and the hydrographic data was used to calibrate geostrophic transport estimated using altimetry data. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of the geostrophic transport obtained using the calibrated altimetry data (Figure 1) was quite similar to the seasonal cycle of the Eastern Atlantic contribution to the AMOC, as measured by the RAPID array. To understand the relationship between the seasonal cycle found in the CC and CUC, and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of the AMOC transport associated with Rossby waves, a sensitivity study of the Rossby wave model is included.",

The interest in this problem is motivated by numerous observations of magnetic oscillations with frequencies in the range of 0.1-4.0 Hz detected on the ground at low and middle latitudes. In a number of studies these oscillations interpreted as shear Alfven waves standing inside the so-called ionopspheric Alfven resonator (IAR). We present results from two-dimensional, time dependent simulations of the reduced two-fluid MHD model performed in the dipole magnetic field geometry with the realistic parameters of the magnetospheric plasma. These simulations show that these pulsations can be produced by the fundamental mode of the global field line resonator (FLR), spanning the entire magnetic field line in the low or middle magnetosphere. Simulations also show that even the waves with the highest considered frequencies (2.44 Hz) are not trapped inside the ionospheric resonator. Therefore, if these waves will be generated by some ionospheric source, then they can reach the equatorial magnetosphere and interact with energetic protons in the proton radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost underlies about a quarter of the northern hemispheric landmass and stores about 1450 Pg organic carbon (OC). When permafrost thaws, its OC is remobilized into the environment where it is available for degradation, transport or burial. The fate of this OC is partly determined by the type of thaw: (i) abrupt thaw of ice-rich Pleistocene permafrost causing collapse and deep exposure, and (ii) gradual thaw of the surface active layer causing release of topsoil, modern permafrost. The relative magnitude of each thaw pathway, along with its potential impacts on the permafrost carbon feedback, are however not known.\nWe here present compound-specific deuterium analysis as a permafrost tracing tool to distinguish between old permafrost OC release, primarily released through abrupt thaw, and modern permafrost OC release, mostly released through gradual active layer thaw. We analyzed δ2H values of leaf waxes extracted from both Pleistocene-aged permafrost samples (n=9) and modern vegetation/O-horizon (topsoil) samples (n=9) from across northeast coastal Siberia. We analyzed both long-chain n-alkanes (chain lengths C25, C27, C29 and C31) as well as long-chain n-alkanoic acids (C22, C24, C26, C28).\nResults show more depleted values for the Pleistocene samples (-264±33 and -280±6.5‰ for average n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, respectively) than for the topsoil samples (-227±23 and -234±13‰). The variability in distribution and δ2H signals for n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanes of topsoils is higher than the Pleistocene samples, that show more constant values, yet the isotopic distinction between the two sources is consisten. For n-alkanes, there is a clear decrease in δ2H signal with chain length (from -201±32 to -247±23‰ for topsoil, and -221±26 to -297±15‰ for Pleistocene samples). These data suggest that δ2H analysis on leaf wax lipids in environments receiving OC from permafrost thaw can be used to assess the relative input of Pleistocene versus modern permafrost material.",

            "abstract": "Indian terrestrial ecosystem exhibits large temporal and spatial variability in carbon sources and sinks due to its monsoon based climate system, diverse land use and land cover distribution and cultural practices. In this study, a multi-model based assessment is made to study the trends and variability in the land carbon uptake for India over the 20th century. Data from nine models which are a part of a recent land surface model intercomparison project called TRENDY is used for the study. These models are driven with common forcing data over the period of 1901–2010. Model output variables assessed include: gross primary production (GPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), autotrophic respiration (Ra) and net primary production (NPP). The net ecosystem productivity (NEP) for the Indian region was calculated as a difference of NPP and Rh and it was found that NEP for the region indicates an estimated increase in uptake over the century by -0.6 TgC/year per year. NPP for India also shows an increasing trend of 2.03% per decade from 1901-2010. Seasonal variation in the multimodel mean NPP is maximum during the southwest monsoon period (JJA) followed by the post monsoon period (SON) and is attributed to the maximum in rainfall for the region during the months of JJA. To attribute the changes seen in the land carbon variables, influence of climatic drivers such as precipitation, temperature and remote influences of large scale phenomenon such as ENSO on the land carbon of the region are also estimated in the study. It is found that although changes in precipitation shows a good correlation to the changes seen in NEP, remote drivers like ENSO do not have much effect on them. The Net Ecosystem Exchange is calculated with the inclusion of the land use change flux and fire flux from the models. NEE suggests that the region behaves as a small sink for carbon with an net uptake of 5 GtC over the past hundred years.",

Dynamics of the North Atlantic Ridge and the Iceland Hotspot, evolution of the passive margins on both sides of the ocean, and the nature of the upper-mantle flow beneath the region are some of the important fundamental problems that we can make progress on using new, more detailed and accurate models of seismic structure and anisotropy within the lithosphere and underlying mantle. We assemble a very large waveform dataset including all publicly available data in the region, from both permanent and temporary seismic networks and experiments conducted in Northern and Western Europe, Iceland, Canada, USA, Greenland and Russia. The tomographic model is constrained by vertical-component waveform fits, computed using the Automated Multimode Inversion of surface, S and multiple S waves. Each seismogram fit provides a set of linear equations describing 1D average velocity perturbations with respect to a 3D reference velocity model along source-receiver paths. All the equations are then combined into a large linear system and inverted jointly for a model of shear- and compressional-wave speeds and azimuthal anisotropy within the lithosphere and underlying mantle. The isotropic-average shear speeds reflect the temperature and composition at depth, offering important new information on both regional- and basin-scale lithospheric structure and evolution. Azimuthal anisotropy provides evidence on the past and present deformation in the lithosphere and asthenosphere beneath the region which can be interpreted together with other evidence from geological and geophysical data and recent plate kinematic models.",

            "abstract": "Clay minerals are very prevalent in many depositional systems. Clay minerals are important as their surface properties makes them cohesive causing them to commonly exist as aggregate grains rather than dispersed suspension. Understanding this aggregation process and the subsequent effects of this process on the, transport, deposition and erosion of these materials is essential to effectively comprehend, model and predict modern and ancient sedimentary systems. Past work in the subject had revealed that during transport and prior to deposition these materials undergo a complex range of processes involving erosion, re-deposition, and transport that are much more complicated than those that occur in the sandy systems. This complexity is likely caused by substantial inter-particle interaction. Despite this work, most of it had been limited to relatively dilute turbulent flows where fine particles either aggregate into flocs or are involved in hindered settling without considering the effects of changes in rheology. In the light of this problem we present a set of rheological analysis of pure kaolinite, pure bentonite and mix kaolininite-bentonite slurries to understand i) the range of concentrations to which rheological changes occur, and ii) different transport mechanisms as a function of their concentration.",

Judging from\nthe posteriori misfits, an average accuracy of 0.4 seconds was obtained despite the presence of some outliers.\nUsing this accuracy estimate, current detection rates as a function of distance and magnitude, and observed trajectories of floats in the oceanographic ARGO program, we have modelled the data yield expected from a global array of MERMAIDs operating for five years (a new, second generation, MERMAID has a longevity in excess of five years). With 300 MERMAIDs, we expect to obtain 102,080 onset times, which allows an almost perfect geographical coverage. This rises to 341,607 in a simulation with 1000 MERMAIDs, which is much less than the 1,567,829 selected over the same period from the ISC catalogue. However, inverting these together in a checkerboard test (Figure) shows that we can resolve anomalies of size as small as 300 km almost perfectly in most of the lower mantle, with the exception of the mantle under polar regions, Africa and the South Atlantic. Inverting the ISC data alone leaves the oceanic domain unresolved at this length scale.\nThe cost of such a MARISCOPE array (about $30M) compares favourably with the cost of the US-Array deployment.",

The analytical results of gas and water samples collected during three sampling campaigns (2013, 2014 and 2015) are presented and discussed in order to: i) evaluate the equilibrium temperature(s) of the main fluid reservoir, ii) provide information on the origin of the fluid discharges and the secondary processes controlling their chemistry. Geothermometry based on the chemical composition of thermal waters indicates a maximum equilibrium temperature of 220 °C. This temperature, coupled with the measured amount of discharged Cl, suggest that the total energy released from this system is 1.1±0.2 GW. Atmospheric gases from a thick shallow aquifer contaminate most gas emissions, masking the chemical features of the deep fluid component, with the only exception of a jet fumarole located at 3,000 m a.s.l. (Bramadora). The H2O-CO2-CH4-H2-CO-C3H6-C3H8 composition of this gas emission was used to construct a geochemical conceptual model showing that the hydrothermal reservoir is liquid-dominated and thermally stratified, with temperatures ranging from 180 to 270 °C. The helium isotopic ratios (up to 6.8 Ra) and the δ13C-CO2 values (from -7.05 to -7.75 ‰ V-PDB) indicate that mantle degassing represents the dominant primary source for this dormant volcano. These results highlight the huge potential of this system as energy resource for the region. Accordingly, the regional authorities have recently planned and approved an investigation project aimed to provide further insights into the fluid geochemistry and the geostructural assessment in this promising area.",

We propose a new outlook on the history of the Arctida paleocontinent, which combined sialic blocks of the present Eurasian shelf of the Arctic Ocean. Our model implies two Arctidas at that time. The earlier Arctida-I was located near equator and connected the continental margins of Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia within the supercontinent of Rodinia. The Arcrtida-I disintegration was caused by a breakup of Rodinia. As a result, small plates like on Svalbard, Kara, New Siberia Island (NSI) terrane and others were formed. We have reconstructed the main stages of later remobilization and global drift of these plates before Pangea assemblage. In contrast to traditional interpretation of the NSI as a part of the Chukchi-Alaska terrane, our observation suggest a linkage between the NSI and Kolyma-Omolon terrane that framed Siberia. As a result of Pangea assembly at Paleozoic-Mesozoic boundary the second recovery of Arctida took place. We assume that Arctida-II also connected Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia but constituted the Pangean periphery in the temperate latitudes.

            "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter in terrestrial ecosystem models, and a series of global LAI products have been derived from satellite data. To effectively apply these LAI products, it is necessary to evaluate their accuracy reasonablely. The long-term LAI measurements from the global network sites are an important supplement to the product validation dataset. However, the spatial scale mismatch between the site measurement and the pixel grid hinders the utilization of these measurements in LAI product validation. In this study, a pragmatic approach based on the Bayesian linear regression between long-term LAI measurements and high-resolution images is presented for upscaling the point-scale measurements to the pixel-scale. The algorithm was evaluated using high-resolution LAI reference maps provided by the VALERI project at the Järvselja site and was implemented to upscale the long-term LAI measurements at the global network sites. Results indicate that the spatial scaling algorithm can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.42 before upscaling to 0.21 after upscaling compared with the aggregated LAI reference maps at the pixel-scale. Meanwhile, the algorithm shows better reliability and robustness than the ordinary least square (OLS) method for upscaling some LAI measurements acquired at specific dates without high-resolution images.\nThe upscaled LAI measurements were employed to validate three global LAI products, including MODIS, GLASS and GEOV1. Results indicate that (i) GLASS and GEOV1 show consistent temporal profiles over most sites, while MODIS exhibits temporal instability over a few forest sites. The RMSE of seasonality between products and upscaled LAI measurement is 0.25-1.72 for MODIS, 0.17-1.29 for GLASS and 0.36-1.35 for GEOV1 along with different sites. (ii) The uncertainty for products varies over different months. The lowest and highest uncertainty for MODIS are 0.67 in March and 1.53 in August, for GLASS are 0.67 in November and 0.99 in July, and for GEOV1 are 0.61 in March and 1.23 in August, respectively. (iii) The overall uncertainty for MODIS, GLASS and GEOV1 is 1.36, 0.90 and 0.99, respectively. According to this study, the long-term LAI measurements can be used to validate time series remote sensing products by spatial upscaling from point-scale to pixel-scale.",

            "abstract": "Processes driving surface uplift in the Andes are still debated and the role of subduction processes as slab flattening on surface uplift and relief building in the Andes is not well understood. Some of the highest Andean summits, the Cordillera Blanca (6768 m) and the Cordillera Negra (5187 m), are located above a present flat subduction zone (3-15°S), in northern Peru. In this area, both the geometry and timing of the flattening of the slab are well constrained (Gutscher et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2005). This region is thus a perfect target to explore the effect of slab flattening on the Andean topography and uplift. We obtained new apatite (U-Th)/He and fission-track ages from three vertical profiles located in the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Negra. Time-temperature paths obtained from inverse modeling of the thermochronological data indicates a Middle Miocene cooling for both Cordillera Negra profiles. We interpret it as regional exhumation in the Cordillera Occidental starting in Middle Miocene, synchronous with the onset of the subduction of the Nazca ridge (Rosenbaum et al., 2005). We propose that the Nazca ridge subduction at 15 Ma and onset of slab flattening in northern Peru drove regional positive dynamic topography and thus enhanced exhumation in the Cordillera Occidental. This study provides new evidence of the impact subduction processes and associated dynamic topography on paleogeography and surface uplift in the Andes.",

In addition to this strong signal, which has been interpreted as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the ISN gas in front of heliosphere, the observations also revealed elevated wings above the background level both in longitude and latitude. This signal, dubbed the a Warm Breeze, is likely the secondary population of ISN He created in the outer heliosheath. In addition, IBEX sees an unexplained ubiquitous background in the lowest energy channels. In this study, we hypothesize departures from the assumptions adopted so far in the data interpretation that could solve remaining unexplained features in the IBEX data or may be pursued by future IMAP mission. We show that the Warm Breeze cannot be explained by a kappa distribution function of the ISN He source. We identify regions in the sky where signatures of the hypothetical kappa distribution of the ISN He atoms would show up. We speculate that the temperature of ISN He in front of the heliosphere is not isotropic and simulate the expected signatures of this anisotropy in the IBEX-Lo signal to identify the regions in the sky that are the most promising to analyze. We compare these results of the study with the IBEX detection capabilities and find that due to its very high signal-to-noise ratio IBEX would be able to see the indicators of the studied scenarios. However, its location close to the magnetosphere and its energy sensitivity threshold makes the discovery very challenging. We specify requirements for IMAP needed to discover the hypothesized departures of the ISN distribution function from standard assumptions and thus allowing a detailed study of plasma-neutral coupling processes in the interstellar medium.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) are now capable of semi-automatic reconstruction of the structure of complete trees or forest stands and have the potential to provide detailed information on tree architecture and foliage biophysical properties. The trends for the next generation of TLS are towards higher resolution, faster scanning and full-waveform data recording, with mobile, multispectral laser devices. The convergence of these technological advances in the next generation of TLS will allow the production of information for forest and woodland mapping and monitoring that is far more detailed, more accurate, and more comprehensive than any available today. This paper describes recent scientific advances in the application of TLS for characterising forest and woodland areas, drawing on the authors’ development of the Salford Advanced Laser Canopy Analyser (SALCA), the activities of the Terrestrial Laser Scanner International Interest Group (TLSIIG), and recent advances in laser scanner technology around the world. The key findings illustrated in the paper are that (i) a complete understanding of system measurement characteristics is required for quantitative analysis of TLS data, (ii) full-waveform data recording is required for extraction of forest biophysical variables and, (iii) multi-wavelength systems provide additional spectral information that is essential for classifying different vegetation components. The paper uses a range of recent experimental TLS measurements to support these findings, and sets out a vision for new research to develop an information-rich future-forest information system, populated by mobile autonomous multispectral TLS devices.",

            "abstract": "The impact of temperate forests on their environment is uncertain [1]. While forests generally have a lower albedo, the flux partitioning over forests and its relation to weather conditions is still poorly understood [2,3], complicating modeling attempts. Effects of land surface conditions on boundary-layer humidity and cloud formation can also be very non-linear [4]. Furthermore, the study of hydrological and climate impacts of temperate European forests is complicated because forests are fragmented and often can be found on hilly terrain, making it impossible to attribute differences in cloud cover directly to forest cover.\nIn this study, we analyse 10 years (2004-2013) of cloud cover data from the SEVIRI instrument aboard the Meteosat Second Generation satellite platform at a 15-minute temporal resolution [5]. We focus on two regions in France where large forests are found which satisfy the following criteria: a) absence of strong topography, and b) presence of sharp contrast between forest and non-forest regions. Cloud occurrence is expressed by the fraction of the daytime that clouds are detected within a ∼6 km MSG pixel. We find that in particular in summer and late summer, clouds are more likely to occur over forest than over the surrounding non-forest land (order of 20%). An opposite signal, but of weaker magnitude, is found in spring, when clouds are less likely to develop over forest. Difference in cloud occurrence is consistent with MODIS-derived differences in EVI, which reflects a more pronounced soil moisture reduction in the non-forested areas.\nIn addition to investigating seasonal and diurnal patterns, we also investigate the effects of windthrow on cloud occurrence. In 2009, storm Klaus caused extensive damage in southern France, resulting in a large-scale disturbance of the forest cover conditions. This disturbance lead to a significantly lower cloud cover over the forest region in the period after the storm in comparison to the period before the storm, suggesting that storm damage to forests can have unexpected long-term climate impacts through a reduced cloud cover.\n",

This work supports additional studies which are being performed on the same block of shale; fracture toughness, permeability, and chemical analysis. Mechanical tests are being conducted after specimens were conditioned for at least two weeks at 70% constant relative humidity conditions. Specimens are tested under drained conditions, with the constant relative humidity condition maintained on the downstream side of the specimen. The upstream is sealed.\nAnisotropy is determined through testing specimens that have been cored parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. Preliminary results show that when loaded parallel to bedding the shale is roughly 50% weaker. Test are run under constant mean stress conditions when possible (excepting indirect tension, unconfined compression, and hydrostatic). Tests are run in hydrostatic compaction to the desired mean stress, then differential stress is applied axially in displacement control to failure. The constant mean stress condition is maintained by decreasing the confining pressure by half of the increase in the axial stress. Results will be compared to typical failure criteria to investigate the effectiveness of capturing the behavior of the shale with traditional failure theory.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

            "abstract": "The concept of coupled human and environmental systems (CHES) has been a dominant framework in the past decade for understanding the cohesive connections between natural and human systems. Here we focus on how socio-ecological services may be regulated by the regional and local water cycles and by ecosystem production in the drylands of Northern Asia (>40 degree N), which includes Inner Mongolia of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Total precipitation and evapotranspiration are used as the primary drivers to explain ecosystem production (e.g., GPP) and indicators of social function and structure (e.g., GDP, population) using the data collected from 1980 through 2010 of these seven areas. We hypothesize that the changes in the regional and local water cycles in these contrasting regions and socioeconomic settings significantly affect CHES functioning. Institutional changes, including shifts in policy, can play a much stronger role than those caused by the physical changes in determining the relationships between water cycle and CHES functioning. The complex connections among the biophysical and socioeconomic variables are analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) at country and regional scales. The highest water use efficiency (GPP:PET=0.57) was found for Uzbekistan, which also had the highest GDP:GPP (0.66) among the seven areas. In contrast, Mongolia exhibited the lowest values during the study period despite its very high GPP:Population value (45.8). The low population in Mongolia appeared responsible for its rank within the dryland region. Regional institutional changes with global ramifications, such as the collapse of Soviet Union and China joining the World Trade Organization, appears to have affected the CHES of the study areas.",

Its 5 building blocks are: (1) The current strategy of volcanic risk management (massive deportation of population) is both problematic and unacceptable. (2) A continuing close habitation of the population with the volcano should be the crucial cultural point to be pursued. This can be accomplished through a redefinition of the danger zone around Summa-Vesuvius as follows: (a) An exclusion nucleus should be established that prohibits all future human settlements and discourage the existing ones; (b) A resilience belt, housing most of the current population, should be established; (c) A sustainable area should be established beyond the resilience belt, allowing for both sustainable practices and temporary resettlements of the “resilience belt” citizens. (3) The built environment construction codes for the population of the danger zone should be established by utilizing Plinian eruption scenarios, scenario-based seismic hazard assessment and zonation, (c) dynamic structural analyses, (d) global volcanic simulations modeling of thermo-fluid dynamic eruption processes. (4) The volcanic risk information and education should involve an effective volcanic risk information campaign and active public preparedness strategy. This should be implemented for the exclusion nucleus, resilience belt, and sustainable area regions surrounding Summa-Vesuvius. A Volcanic Risk Education Safety Program should be implemented in all schools located within each of the above areas surrounding the volcano. (5)The political Authorities and the scientific community should produce a “memorandum of understanding” that univocally establishes an effective collaboration, and periodic progress reports that keep the populations informed on the improvements leading to the realization of the above objectives.

            "abstract": "The March-July eruption of Mt. Etna in 1669 is ranked as one of the most destructive and voluminous eruptions of Etna volcano in historical times. To assess threats from future eruptions, a better understanding of how and over what timescales magma moved underground prior to and during the 1669 eruption is required. We present a combined population based and kinetic modelling approach [1-2] applied to 185 olivine crystals that erupted during the 1669 eruption. By means of this approach we provide, for the first time, a dynamic picture of magma mixing and magma migration activity prior to and during the 1669 flank eruption of Etna volcano. Following the work of [3] we have studied 10 basaltic lava samples (five SET1 and five SET2 samples) that were erupted from different fissures that opened between 950 and 700 m a.s.l. Following previous work [1-2] we were able to classify different populations of olivine based on their overall core and rim compositional record and the prevalent zoning type (i.e. normal vs. reverse). The core plateau compositions of the SET1 and SET2 olivines range from Fo70 up to Fo83 with a single peak at Fo75-76. The rims differ significantly and can be distinguished into two different groups. Olivine rims from the SET1 samples are generally more evolved and range from Fo50 to Fo64 with a maximum at Fo55-57. SET2 olivine rims vary between Fo65-75 with a peak at Fo69. SET1 and SET2 olivines display normal zonation with cores at Fo75-76 and diverging rim records (Fo55-57 and Fo65-75). The diverging core and rim compositions recorded in the SET1 and SET2 olivines can be attributed to magma evolution possibly in three different magmatic environments (MEs): M1 (=Fo75-76), M2 (=Fo69) and M3 (=Fo55-57) with magma transfer and mixing amongst them. The MEs established in this study differ slightly from those identified in previous works [1-2]. We note the relative lack of olivines with Fo-rich core and rim compositions indicating a major mafic magma recharge event occurring prior to or during the 1669 eruption. Modelling the diffusive relaxation of the compositional zoning profiles in olivine reveals timescales on the order of 20 days up to 1 year for the transfer of magma between the different MEs.\n[1] Kahl et al.

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional modeling of frequency airborne electromagnetic data is vital to improve the understanding of electromagnetic (EM) responses collected in increasingly complex geologic settings. We developed a modeling scheme for 3D airborne electromagnetic modeling in frequency domain with topography using edge finite element. The rectangular mesh can be transformed to hexahedral in order to simulate the topography effect. The finite element algorithm uses a single edge shape function at each edge of hexahedral elements, guaranteeing the continuity of the tangential electric field while conserving the continuity of magnetic flux at boundaries. Sources singularities are eliminated through a secondary-field approach, in which the primary fields are computed analytically for a homogeneous or a 1D layered background; the secondary fields are computed using edge finite element. The solution of the linear system of equations was obtained using a massive parallel multifrontal solver, because such solver are robust for indefinite and ill-conditioned linear systems. Parallel computing were investigated for their use in mitigating the computational overburden associated with the use of a direct solver, and of its feasibility for 3D frequency airborne electromagnetic forward modeling with the edge finite element. For the multisource problem, when using a direct solver, only competitive if the same factors are used to achieve a solution for multi right-hand sides. We tested our proposed approach using 1D and 3D synthetic models, and they demonstrated it is robust and suitable for 3D frequency airborne electromagnetic modeling. The codes could thus be used to help design new survey, as well to estimate subsurface conductivities through the implementation of an appropriate inversion scheme.",

The geodetic benchmarks in the southern Central Range can be only deployed on the major highways because the rough topography makes the survey and maintenance of benchmarks more difficult. Due to the uneven distribution of benchmarks, the surface displacement data is limited in two mountain-crossing highways and edge of the mountain, so the deformation pattern in the center of the southern Central Range is not clear.\nIn order to understand the comprehensive deformation pattern of the southern Central Range, we then use the geomorphic indices to describe the differential uplift pattern of the active orogeny. The geomorphic indices can reflect the surface deformation, which can help us to reconstruct the deformation pattern in the areas without geodetic measurements. The following two geomorphic indices are used in the study, river steepness index (ksn) and basin asymmetry factor (AF). We first use the two indices to describe the overall surface deformation pattern of the southern Central Range, then we focus on the geomorphic indices an active antiform area. The active antiform is revealed by a geodetic surveying line along the Laonung River which is oblique to the axis of this slate antiform, and the maximum uplift rate is around 11 to 12 mm/yr. The incision rate of Laonung River calculated from terrace dating shows the uplift rate of the antiform is 18 to 19 mm/yr for the past 2000 years.\nThe result shows the ksn pattern of the southern Central Range can be correlated with uplift rate, and the AF can be correlated with the differential uplift from north to south of the southern Central Range. The ksn in the active antiform area also shows the higher ksn is linked to higher uplift rate, and the AF values around the antiform shows the forelimb of the active antiform is tilted more than the crest.",

            "abstract": "Most of the studies on heat waves focus on their occurrences in the USA, Europe, China and Australia. Only a few articles deal with heat waves over the Sahel, even though monthly maximum temperatures in this region can rise to up to 40°C before the arrival of the summer monsoon. The focus here is on identifying and comprehending the physical mechanisms involved in the occurrence and phenomenology of springtime heat waves over the Sahel.\nIn order to analyse those physical mechanisms, a heat index based on synoptic and intra-seasonal changes was defined. This new detection method was applied separately to daily maximum and minimum temperatures, leading to heat indexes respectively called HWmax and HWmin. This separation matters because physical processes linked to these two temperatures are expected to differ: maximum temperature fluctuations may be connected to cloud-aerosol-induced changes in surface shortwave radiation, whereas the influence of atmospheric humidity may be predominant for the minimum temperature, via its impact on surface longwave fluxes during nightime.\nUsing the ERA-Interim reanalysis over the period 1979-2014, a hundred heat waves per heat index have been detected, that is roughly three heat waves per year, of mean length 5 to 6 days. HWmax perceived heat waves from March to July whereas HWmin recorded heat waves from March to May only. The temperature and other dynamic and thermodynamic variables, as well as severity, were further analysed in order to provide the major heat wave properties, and to assess whether archetypes can be identified.\nFinally, the detected heat waves have been compared to those picked up by classical heat indexes like the NOAA index and quantile-based indexes. The differences between the heat waves identified with the ERA-Interim, ERA-40, MERRA and NCEP2 reanalyses, the observationally-based BEST data and those obtained with local data will also be discussed, in particular their fluctuations over the past decades.",

High sensitivity seismograph network (Hi-net) was constructed by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) as a national project in order to improve the detection capability of microearthquake after disastrous 1995 Kobe earthquake. Hi-net has been contributing to not only monitoring of seismicity but also producing many research results like as discoveries of non-volcanic tremor and other slow earthquakes. More important thing is that we have continued to make efforts to monitor all of data visually and effectively.\nThe discovery of tremor in southwest Japan stimulated PGC researchers to search similar seismic signature in Cascadia because of a couple of common features in the tremor in Japan and slow slip event (SSE) they already discovered in Cascadia. At last, episodic tremor and slip (ETS) was discovered, then the SSE associated with tremor was also detected in Japan by using the tilting data measured by high-sensitivity accelerometer attached with the Hi-net. This coupling phenomena strengthened the connection between seismology and geodesy. Widely separated spectrum of tremor and SSE motivated us to search intervened phenomena, then we found very low frequency earthquake during ETS episode. These slow earthquakes obey a scaling law different from ordinary earthquake. This difference is very important to resolve the earthquake physics.\nHi-net is quite useful for not only three-dimensional imaging of underground structure beneath the Japan Islands, but also resolving deep Earth interior by using teleseismic events or ambient noises and source rupture process of large earthquakes by using back-projection analysis as a remote array. Hi-net will continue to supply unexpected new discoveries. I expect that multiple installation of similar dense seismic array in the world will give us great opportunity to discover more important and explore a new regime in the earth science.",

            "abstract": "Fire plays an important role in many boreal ecosystems, and fire severity depends on productivity and climate. The boreal forest region of eastern Canada is characterized by both poor soils and a cool, moist climate, suggesting that fire may be less common than in other regions. We collected sediment cores from Canoe (elev. 152 m) and Big Beer (elev. 411 m) lakes and analyzed cores for charcoal, carbon, d15C, biogenic silica, and magnetics. The sediment record for both lakes dated to ~9000 calibrated years BP, and sediment accumulation rates were low for both lakes (40 and 95 yrs cm-1). Biogenic silica and carbon data indicate nearly simultaneous increases in lake and terrestrial productivity from ~8000-7000 BP. As indicated by charcoal, fire was present in the landscape as early as 8500 BP. Fire was more common at the lower elevation Canoe site and largely absent from the higher elevation Big Beer site. Average charcoal accumulation rates at both sites (< 0.01 mm2 cm-2 yr-1) were < 50% of those previously reported for boreal forest sites in more western Canada. Our results support a reduced role for fire in this landscape although it is yet unclear whether poor soils or climate are more directly causal.",

We perform a statistical study of EMIC waves detected by the Van Allen Probes mission to investigate their spatial distributions under different geomagnetic activity levels, gauged by the AE index and dynamic pressure. Magnetic field measurements from the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) onboard the Van Allen Probes are used to identify EMIC wave events from the first 22 months of the mission operation. EMIC waves are examined in H+-, He+- and O+-bands. Throughout the first 22 months of the Van Allen Probes mission, majority of the data coverage has been during quiet (AE ≤ 100) conditions. Results show that as AE increases, the spatial distributions of EMIC waves converges to the afternoon sector. Disturbed conditions yielded stronger H+- and He+-band EMIC waves. The afternoon sector featured higher occurrence rates for He+-band EMIC waves. Provided are also breakdowns by spectral properties versus L* under the different geomagnetic conditions and wave power thresholds. Examining solar wind dynamic pressure shows that most events occurred with a pressure < 4 nPa. A wave power versus pressure analysis under the different wave bands has also been conducted.",

            "abstract": "Integration of geochemical data with time breaks inferred from physical characteristics in early-erupted fall deposits shed light on the triggering mechanisms and initial episodic behavior1 of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (HRT: 2500 km3) supereruption2. In each layer sampled in the basal 2 m of fall deposits at Mount Everts, wide H2O variations (1.0-4.7 wt.%) in co-erupted, fully enclosed, quartz-hosted rhyolitic melt inclusions (MI) imply <1 day to a week of diffusive loss. These data indicate highly variable and surprisingly slow ascent conditions during the opening stages of the eruption. The second largest Quaternary eruption on Earth2 started hesitatingly, with magma slowly ascending to feed periodic explosive activity, with time breaks manifested by contemporaneous reworking in the fall deposits1. Importantly, this behavior requires low degrees of overpressure in the feeding magma body to permit such slow ascent4, and we thus propose that external rather than internal (i.e. chamber overpressure) controls were central to initiation of the HRT eruption. In addition, multi-variant cluster analysis on trace elements for all MI reveals that the fall deposit contains six statistically distinct host-quartz populations. CO2 vs. restored H2O data show that the first erupted, most evolved compositions crystallized deeper (150-200 MPa), whereas the later-erupted, least evolved compositions crystallized shallower (100-140 MPa). This diversity indicates that the quartz populations represent magma bodies that were spatially separated to some extent during crystallization and evolution from a chemically similar parent. However, trace element analysis of reentrants and co-erupted obsidian clasts, which represent the compositions of melts at the time of eruption, although clustered, have values that correspond to only three of the six quartz populations. Taken all together, we conclude that the HRT eruption onset saw several vents active simultaneously and sequentially, supporting the notion that an external trigger, such as rifting or fault motion, caused destabilization, and accompanied the initial evacuation, of the HRT magma body.\n1 Wilson (2009), AGU, #V23C-2085. 2Christiansen (2001) USGS Prof. Pap. 729G, 1-143. 3Mason et al.

However, few studies can be found to have measurement uncertainty considered in the calibration process due to the fact of lacking both available data and scientifically credible guidance. In this study, measurement uncertainty is jointly incorporated in the Integrated Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Tool (IPEAT) with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate model performance and the associated predictive uncertainty. Results show that streamflow simulations were not noticeably affected by the incorporation of measurement uncertainty. On the other hand, considerable impact was implied on sediment and ammonia predictions in terms of error statistics. In addition, no clear tendency of changes on predictive uncertainty while implementing varying levels of measurement uncertainty. The goal of this study was not to identify the superiority of model performance by including measurement uncertainty but to provide better understanding of the associated potential influences.

It is collaborative between UNAVCO (NSF’s geodetic facility), Mt San Antonio College, and Indiana University. GETSI was initiated after requests by geoscience faculty for geodetic teaching resources for introductory and majors-level students. Full modules take two weeks but module subsets can also be used. Modules are developed and tested by two co-authors and also tested in a third classroom. GETSI is working in partnership with the Science Education Resource Center’s (SERC) InTeGrate project on the development, assessment, and dissemination to ensure compatibility with the growing number of resources for geoscience education. Two GETSI modules are being published in October 2015. “Ice mass and sea level changes” includes geodetic data from GRACE, satellite altimetry, and GPS time series. “Imaging Active Tectonics” has students analyzing InSAR and LiDAR data to assess infrastructure earthquake vulnerability. Another three modules are in testing during fall 2015 and will be published in 2016. “Surface process hazards” investigates mass wasting hazard and risk using LiDAR data. “Water resources and geodesy” uses GRACE, vertical GPS, and reflection GPS data to have students investigating droughts in California and the High Great Plains. “GPS, strain, and earthquakes” helps students learn about infinitesimal and coseismic strain through analysis of horizontal GPS data and includes an extension module on the Napa 2014 earthquake. In addition to teaching resources, the GETSI project is compiling recommendations on successful development of geodesy curricula. The chief recommendations so far are the critical importance of including scientific experts in the authorship team and investing significant resources in data preparation (student interns can be excellent for this). GETSI also includes a research element on the way instructors adapt or adopt the resources. After publication, 4 additional testers will be recruited per module. They will provide feedback on how they choose to use the module elements in their courses.",

            "abstract": "Dicarboxylic acids (diacids) are dominant components of organic aerosols in the atmosphere. They contribute significantly to the total aerosol mass and have a serious impacts on global climate changes. However, studies on keto- and hydroxy-diacids in marine aerosols are limited. Compare to diacids, keto- and hydroxy-diacids are more hygroscopic due to the additional polar groups (OH and CO) and, hence, acts as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Molecular characterization of these compounds provides insight into organic aerosols sources and transformation pathways. We collected marine aerosols from remote Chichijima Island in the western North Pacific from December 2010 to November 2011 and studied for water-soluble keto- and hydroxy-diacids. Carboxyl groups were derivatized to dibutyl esters with 14% boron trifluoride/n-butanol, whereas hydroxyl groups were derivatized to trimethylsilyl ethers using N,O-Bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). After two-step derivatization, samples were injected to GC, GC/MS and GC/TOF-MS. In the GC chromatogram, we detected several new peaks after BSTFA derivatization of dibutyl ester fraction. Based on mass spectral interpretation, we found these peaks as homologues series of hydroxy-diacids and keto-diacids. Some of these hydroxy-diacids have been individually reported in literature in the laboratory photo-oxidation experiments and forest environments samples. But, there are no evidences to prove their sources and formation mechanism in the atmosphere. Here, we report for the first time homologous series of hydroxy-diacids (hC3di-hC6di) and keto-diacid (oxaloacetic acid, enol and keto forms) in remote marine atmosphere. Molecular distributions of hydroxy-diacids generally showed the predominance of malic acid followed by tartronic acid. Both hydroxy- and keto-diacids show significant positive correlation with oxalic acid and SO42-, suggesting that they are generated in the atmosphere and play an important role in the formation of smaller diacids through aqueous phase photo-oxidation.",

Given improved analytic techniques and mathematical models, geochronology is beginning to take such diffusion into account in a quantitative fashion. Whilst lattice diffusion compromises simple interpretation of radiometric data, it can, when combined with spatially resolved data, provide more detailed insight into thermal histories. In regions that have experienced particularly high temperatures diffusion may become significant in minerals normally thought to be reliably closed. We have modelled Pb diffusion in zircon, building on earlier work on Ar diffusion in micas – the mathematics being basically the same. We are motivated by some challenging isotope data from zircon in the Lewisian Complex of NW Scotland (a TTG region with a long Archaean and Proterozoic history). For example we have grains with old rims and younger cores. Whilst other explanations are possible, we show how lattice diffusion of Pb is plausible, using experimental diffusion data together with estimates of ultra-high temperatures from the region. We have modified a previous model for Ar diffusion (“Diffarg”) to include variations in parent isotope concentration, so we can understand the consequences of U zonation within zircon grains during prolonged thermal histories. This is also relevant to asking why Pb has apparently not diffused in zircon from other UHT regions – or has it?",

A detailed laboratory calibration of FIRST was conducted before the most recent field campaign to NASA’s JPL Table Mountain Facility. Radiosonde data were taken concurrently with the FIRST measurements during this deployment to provide temperature and water vapor profiles for model simulations of the FIRST spectra. Results are presented for the night of October 19, 2012, the driest time during this deployment when the total column water vapor amount was less than 0.3cm. The FIRST data showed significant spectral development between 400 and 600 cm-1, wherein over 90% arose within 2.8 km of the surface. In contrast, the spectra between both 200 and 400 cm-1 and 600 and 750 cm-1 were characteristic of blackbody radiation with near-surface temperatures. This result can be ascribed to very high opacities wherein the mean free paths were frequently less than 40m. This, in combination with near-surface temperature inversions, required layer thicknesses as fine as 10m for the radiative transfer calculations. Overall, we found that when all of the measurement and modeling uncertainties were considered that the FIRST measurements agreed with the model calculations to within the combined uncertainties. Most notably, we found that the uncertainties in the model calculations exceeded those in the measurements, with the uncertainty in the radiosonde measured water vapor abundances being the largest contributor. Newly proposed instruments, such as those for the CLARREO mission, will have much greater accuracies than FIRST, and consequently will have the capability to measure the far-infrared spectra to much higher accuracies than can be computed. Direct measurements of the far-infrared are essential to the assessment of future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are being produced in increasing amounts and have numerous applications in a variety of products and industrial processes. The same properties that make these substances so appealing may also cause them to act as persistent and toxic pollutants. The post-use release of ENPs to the environment is inevitable and soil appears to be one of the largest sinks of these potential contaminants. To date, despite the significant attention that ENP behavior in the environment has received, only a few studies have considered the fate and transport of ENPs in partially saturated systems. Here, we report measurements on the transport and fate of three commonly used ENPs – silver (Ag), gold (Au) and zinc oxide (ZnO) – in partially saturated porous media. The results show that ENP interactions with the solid matrix and solution components affect the fate of the ENPs and their transport. The negatively charged ENPs (AgNPs and AuNPs) are shown to be mobile in sand (which is also negatively charged) under various conditions, including water saturation levels and inlet concentration, with transport behavior resembling conservative tracer movement. Various aging scenarios were considered and the interaction of AgNPs with sulfides, chlorides, and calcium ions, all of which are known to interact and change AgNP properties, are shown to affect AgNP fate; however, in some cases, the changed particles remained suspended in solution and mobile. The positively charged ZnO showed very low mobility, but when humic acid was present in the inlet solution, interactions leading to enhanced mobility were observed. The presence of humic acid also changes ENP size and surface charge, transforming them to negatively charged larger aggregates that can be transported through the sand. Finally, remobilization of particles that were retained in the porous media was also demonstrated for ZnO ENPs, indicating possible release of entrapped ENPs upon changes in solution chemistry.",

This region, located between 22˚S-22˚N and 216-288˚E, is one of two longitudinally distinct regions on Ceres where ESA Herschel space telescope data suggested a release of water vapor [1] and hosts: 1) the 92 km diameter impact crater Occator in the NW of the quadrangle, whose rim is scalloped and whose interior encompasses Hubble “Bright Spot 5”; 2) the 115 km diameter crater Kirnis, a degraded crater that contains a large dome-like feature on the western half of its floor; and 3) regional linear structures, that both cut crater rims (including Occator and Kirnis) and affect crater shapes. Key goals of the ongoing mapping are to 1) determine the source of the bright spots in Occator; 2) determine if the dome-like feature in Kirnis resulted from a mass-wasting or is a product of uplift; and 3) assess the relationships between linear structural features and impact craters, including the effects of surface stress regimes on crater formation and modification. At the time of this writing geologic mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from late Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including clear filter and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the mapping, followed by Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) images starting in December 2015.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

            "abstract": "The theory of gas injection processes is a central element required to understand how components move and partition in the reservoir as one fluid is displacing another (i.e., gas is displacing oil). There is significant amount of work done in the area of interaction of phase-behavior and flow in multiphase flow conditions. We would like to present how the theory of gas injection is used in the industry to understand/design reservoir processes in various ways.\nThe tools that are developed for the theory of gas injection originates from the fractional flow theory, as the first solution proposed by Buckley-Leveret in 1940’s, for water displacing oil in porous media. After 1960’s more and more complex/coupled equations were solved using the initial concept(s) developed by Buckley-Leverett, and then Welge et al. and others. However, the systematic use of the fractional flow theory for coupled set of equations that involves phase relationships (EOS) and phase appearance and disappearance was mainly due to the theory developed by Helfferich in early 80’s (in petroleum literature) using method of characteristics primarily for gas injection process and later on by the systematic work done by Orr and his co-researchers during the last two decades. In this talk, we will present various cases that use and extend the theory developed by Helfferich and others (Orr et al., Lake et al. etc.).\nThe review of various injection systems reveals that displacement in porous media has commonalities that can be represented with a unified theory for a class of problems originating from the theory of gas injection (which is in a way generalized Buckley-Leverett problem).\nThe outcome of these solutions can be used for (and are not limited to):\n1) Benchmark solutions for reservoir simulators (to quantify numerical dispersion, test numerical algorithms)\n2) Streamline simulators\n3) Design of laboratory experiments and their use (to invert the results)\n4) Conceptual learning and to investigate the microscopic displacement efficiency.\n5) MMP/MME for various processes (not only for gas injection)",

            "abstract": "The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on the morning of the 8th of March 2014 is one of the great mysteries of our time. One relevant aspect of this mystery is that not a single piece of debris from the aircraft was found during the intensive surface search carried out in the months following the crash. Difficulties in the search efforts were due to the uncertainty in the plane’s final impact point and the time passed since the accident and rise the question on how the debris was scattered in an always moving ocean, for which there exist multiple datasets that do not uniquely determine its state. Our approach to this problem is based on dynamical systems tools that identify dynamic barriers and coherent structures governing transport. By combining publicly available information supplied by different ocean data sources with these mathematical techniques, we are able to assess the spatio-temporal state of the ocean in the priority search area at the time of impact and the following weeks. Using this information we propose a revised search strategy by showing why one might not have expected to find debris in some large search areas targeted by the search services and determining regions where one might have expected impact debris to be located and that were not subjected to any exploration.\nThis research has been supported by MINECO under grants MTM2014-56392-R and ICMAT Severo Ochoa project SEV-2011-0087 and ONR grant No. N00014- 01-1-0769.

            "abstract": "TARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of Radiations from lightNings and Sprites) is a CNES micro satellite. Its main objective is to study impulsive transfers of energy between the Earth atmosphere and the space environment. It will be sun-synchronous at an altitude of 700 km. It will be launched from late 2017 for at least 2 years. Its payload is composed of several electromagnetic instruments in different wavelengths (from gamma-rays to radio waves including optical). TARANIS instruments are currently in calibration and qualification phase.\nThe purpose of this poster is to present the MicroCameras and Photometers (MCP) scientific objectives and the sensor design, to show the performances of this instrument using the recent characterization, and at last to promote its products.\nThe MicroCameras, developed by Sodern, are dedicated to the spatial description of TLEs and their parent lightning. They are able to differentiate sprite and lightning thanks to two narrow bands ([757-767 nm] and [772-782 nm]) that provide simultaneous pairs of images of an Event. The calibration results will be detailed. Simulation results of the differentiation method will be shown.\nPhotometers, developed by Bertin Technologies, will provide temporal measurements and spectral characteristics of TLEs and lightning. It is a key instrument because of its on-board detection of the TLEs which can trigger the whole payload. Photometers use four spectral bands in the [170-260 nm], [332-342 nm], [757-767 nm] and [600-900 nm] and have the same field of view as cameras. The calibration results will also be detailed. The on-board TLE detection algorithm remote-controlled parameters will be tuned before launch using the electronic board and simulated or real events waveforms. Automatic classification tools are now tested to produce for the Scientific Mission Center some lists of elves, sprites or lightning without TLE following the recent work of Offroy et al. [2015] using ISUAL spectrophotometer data.",

            "abstract": "Using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, we have investigated the features of migrations of atmospheric mass (AM) between Land and Ocean (MAMLO) for Eurasia-North Pacific region in boreal winter. An index is defined for describing this MAMLO phenomenon. Our results have demonstrated that there is an anti-phase relationship in anomalous AM variations over regions between Eurasia and mid-latitude North Pacific, which is referred to as Eurasia-(North)Pacific anti-phase relation (EPAR). This EPAR pattern characterizes with two major centers of surface air pressure anomalies (SAPA) over those two regions respectively, and varies on timescales ranging from (inter)decadal to inter-annual. The formation of this EPAR teleconnection is significantly associated with three factors including the anomalous AM flows, the Rossby wave energy propagations, and the thermal forcing contrasts between Eurasia and North Pacific during boreal winter. The variations of both wintertime rainfall and temperature over Eurasia are closely related to MAMLO phenomenon. When the MAMLO index is positive (negative), there occurs the AM accumulation (depletion) over Eurasia with simultaneous depletion (accumulation) over mid-latitude North-Pacific. Correspondingly, this SAPA pattern along with the related circulation anomalies at different isobaric levels possibly results in winter precipitation decreases (increases) over Eurasia in the mid- and high- latitudes and East Asia, whereas increases (decreases) over regions of the Mediterranean, Xinjiang of China, and the west coast of Sea of Okhotsk. On the other hand, surface air temperature decreases (increases) over large areas of Eurasia. These results are helpful for our better understanding the mechanisms behind circulation and winter climate variations over Eurasia-North Pacific region.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the origin of moisture that feeds deep convective clouds in the absence of large-scale forcing. Thereby the focus lies on the interplay between atmospheric moisture and deep convective clouds via cold-pool dynamics. Redistribution processes such as advection are contrasted with local moistening processes in a series of cloud-resolving modelling studies. More specifically the contribution of moisture advection, evaporation of rain and surface fluxes to the moisture budget over particular regions of the domain is investigated. This is done both for a continental case and an oceanic case although both cases show a very similar behaviour. The accumulation of moisture in confined regions of the sub-cloud layer that constitute preferred locations for future cloud development mainly results from the advection of moisture. The latter contributes to ~86 %, minor evaporation of precipitation contributes to ~4%, whereas surface moisture fluxes yield ~11% in the continental case. In the oceanic case advection contributes to ~125%, surface moisture fluxes to ~-32% and evaporation of precipitation to ~7%.\nTo further identify the origin of the advected moisture additional scalars marking moisture originating from the surface and from the evaporation of rain are introduced into the model. It is seen that the surface moisture and the evaporated rain water that were released within the last two hours only make 55% of the moisture accumulated in the moist patches in the land case, the rest stemming from older moisture. In the ocean case this share increases to 72%. The contribution of recently released moisture drops to 28% at cloud base in the continental case and to 56% in the ocean case. The contribution at cloud base is dominated by surface fluxes, the evaporation of rain is negligible.",

            "abstract": "We estimate the total land water storage change over 2003-2013 using a global water mass budget approach. It consists of comparing the ocean mass change from GRACE space gravimetry to the sum of the main water mass components of the climate system : glaciers, Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, atmospheric water vapour and land water storage (the latter being the unknown quantity to be estimated). We first compute a mean trend over the study period. Then, we account for the change in rates (acceleration) seen in several terms of the mass budget equation (e.g., GRACE-based ocean mass, Greenland, Antarctica and glaciers mass balances). For the glaciers and ice sheets, we use published estimates of ice mass trends based on various types of observations covering different sub-periods of the 2003-2013 decade. For each component, we compute a changing rate through time. We also consider time series of mass balance rates and associated accelerations. From the global water mass budget approach, we derive a time series of land water storage rate over the study period. The computed changing rate in global land water storage mainly represents direct anthropogenic effects on land hydrology, i.e. the net effect of ground water depletion and impoundment of water in man-made reservoirs (estimates from hydrological models driven by meteorological forcing show that natural climate variability essentially cause interannual fluctuations in the net land water storage but negligible long term trend). Our results are compared with independent estimates of human-induced changes in global land hydrology, in particular ground water depletion.",

Individual clouds were tracked a posteriori from formation to dissipation using a 3D cloud tracking algorithm and results are presented in the phase-space of center of gravity altitude versus cloud liquid water mass (CvM space). The CvM space (see the figure below) is shown to contain rich information on cloud field properties, such as interactions between clouds, partition to growing, precipitating, and dissipating clouds, degree of adiabaticity, common dissipation pathways, and precipitation efficiency and yields.\nWe show clear effect of the aerosol loading on the shape and size of CvM clusters, with the majority of water mass in the clean case (panel a) attributed to precipitating clouds and the majority of water mass in the polluted case (panel b) attributed to growing clouds. We also find fundamental differences in the CvM space between simulations results using bin versus bulk microphysical schemes, with bin scheme expressing much higher sensitivity to changes in aerosol concentrations.\nUsing the bin microphysical scheme, we find that the increase in cloud center of gravity altitude with increase in aerosol concentrations occurs for a wide range of cloud sizes, except for the smallest clouds. This is attributed to reduced sedimentation, increased buoyancy and vertical velocities, and increased environmental instability, all of which are tightly coupled to inhibition of precipitation processes and subsequent feedbacks of clouds on their environment.",

The shale outcrop was recently exposed by new construction and shows little sign of weathering. Specimens 3 inches in diameter and nominally 6 inches long were cored (parallel to bedding) from blocks taken from the outcrop. A 3 inch hole was then cored down the center of the specimen and “cased” with 0.25 inch high pressure tubing, leaving 0.75 inches of space at the bottom of the borehole uncased.\nSpecimens were then loaded under in an axisymmetric extension stress state and hydraulically fractured in order to generate the appropriate fracture orientation to represent the opening of a fracture in a typical long horizontal well, where fractures are “disks on a string.” After fracture with water, while still under stress, a guar/proppant mixture was injected into the specimen to investigate the distribution of proppant in the fracture. Silicon carbide particles were used as proppant to assist in proppant visualization in microCT scans performed after the test was completed.\nCorresponding numerical analyses (using the finite element method) of the flow path and particle transport are underway, coupled with idealized flow experiments to validate the codes being used to model the particle transport.

            "abstract": "Growing evidence shows that volcanism near the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) may have been crucial in triggering the PTB biocrisis. However, whether this trigger is the Siberian traps or arc island volcanisms has long been debating. Meanwhile, multiple claystone beds are prominent near the PTB, South China. The nature and origin of the volcanic ashes therefore provide clue to find out the trigger of the PTB mass extinction. Following previous studies (Gao et al., 2013), 21 PTB ash beds from three additional PTB sections, namely the Shangsi, Jianshi and Meishan, all from South China have been systematically sampled. The U-Pb ages, trace elements, and Hf-isotope compositions of zircon grains from these ash beds were analyzed using LA-ICPMS and LA-MC-ICPMS. Volcanic ash geochemistry shows presence of Rhyolite or Dacite and reveal a collision-tectonic setting. Zircons from these ash layers yield comparatively low Nb/Hf and high Th/Nb ratios, dropping into the range of arc/orogenic-related settings. Zircon Hf-isotope compositions show that εHf(t) values vary from -11.7 to 1.8, indicating that at least two kinds of crustal component have been involved: juvenile lower crust and ancient middle-upper crust. The ash beds (Ss27a, Js129, Js130, Ms25, Ms26) near biotic extinction horizon have significant larger variation range of εHf(t) and relatively positive averages, implying that more juvenile lower crustal material had contributed to the volcanisms. This means that these volcanisms may have originated deeper depth or the volcanisms erupted so rapidly that there was no enough time for the mixing of different components. The volcanisms associated with biotic extinction should be the most intense and have greatest heat put. Spatial and temporal distributions of ash beds from thirty PTB sections worldwide reveal that the PTB volcanic ashes occurred only in the Paleo-Tethys region, suggesting that the volcanisms may be likely limited to the Paleo-Tethys continental convergence. Integration of Hf-isotope and trace-element compositions of magmatic zircons suggests that the PTB volcanisms have taken place along the convergent continent margin in or near southwestern South China as a result of the closure of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean at that time.",

            "abstract": "Elastic deformation of the Earth caused by seasonal hydrological loading is now well established. We compute the vertical and horizontal deformation induced by large variations of continental water storage at a set of 195 globally distributed continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) stations. Seasonal loading is derived from the Gravity and Recovery Climate experiment (GRACE) equivalent water height data, where we first accounted for non observable degree-1 components using results from Swenson et al. (2010). We find that, while the vertical displacements are well predicted by the model, the horizontal components are systematically underpredicted and out-of-phase with the observations. We discuss possible contributions to this misfit (thermal expansion, draconitic effects, etc.) and show a dramatic improvement when we do not apply a priori degree-1 coefficients but estimate and apply a posteriori a 6-parameters Helmert transform to the horizontal components. The transformation, mostly a Z translation and rotation, considerably improves the fit in phase and amplitude of the seasonal deformation model to the horizontal GPS measurements and does not affect the fit to the vertical component. We conclude that horizontal misfits result mostly from degree-one deformation plus reference frame differences between model and observations. However, the amplitude of global seasonal horizontal displacement remains slightly underpredicted. We explore several hypothesis including the validity of a purely elastic model derived from seismic estimates at an annual time scale. We show that mantle volume variations due to mineral phase transitions may play a role in the seasonal deformation and, as a by-product, use this seasonal deformation to provide a lower bound of the transient astenospheric viscosity.",

On intraseasonal time scales, modeling studies with the high-resolution WRF regional climate model demonstrated that EHP combined with the semi-direct and microphysics effects, associated with enhanced desert dust transported from the Middle East deserts across the Arabian Sea to the Indian subcontinent, may alter the moisture transport pathways, suppress the development of monsoon depression over northeastern India, resulting in development of intense convective cells, and extreme heavy rain along the Himalayan foothills in central and northwestern India.

Results show a structural change in probability distribution functions (pdf) of local precipitation events (LPE) during this period, indicating more intense LPE, less moderate LPE, and more dry (no-rain) days globally. Analyses for land and ocean separately reveal more complex and nuanced changes over land, characterized by a strong positive trend (+12.0% per decade, 99% confidence level (c.l.)) in frequency of extreme LPE’s over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics during the wet season, but a negative global trend (-6.6% per decade, 95% c.l.) during the dry season. Analyses of the risk of drought based on the number of dry days show a significant global drying trend (3.2% per decade, 99% c.l.) over land during the dry season. Regions of pronounced increased drought include western and central US, northeastern Asia and southern Europe/Mediterranean. Trends in cloud distributions from TRMM VIS-IR, and relative humidity from reanalysis have also been examined. Overall, the changes in water cycle parameters are consistent with increasing contrasts between wet and dry precipitation extremes, as reported in previous studies based on observations and climate model projections for a longer period, implying changes in global water cycle was underway during 1998-2013 as if there is no “global warming hiatus”.

            "abstract": "Recent field campaigns have shown that convective dust storms – also known as haboobs or cold pool outflows – contribute a significant fraction of dust uplift over the Sahara and Sahel in summer. However, in-situ observations are sparse and convective dust storms are frequently concealed by clouds in satellite imagery. Therefore numerical models are often the only available source of information over the area. Here a regional climate model with explicit representation of convection delivers the first full seasonal cycle of convective dust storms over North Africa. The model suggests that they contribute one fifth of the annual dust uplift over North Africa, one fourth between May and October, and one third over the western Sahel during this season. In contrast, most large-scale weather and climate models do not explicitly represent convection and thus lack such storms.\nA simple parameterization of convective dust storms has recently been developed, based on the downdraft mass flux of convection schemes. The parameterization is applied here to a set of regional climate runs with different horizontal resolutions and convection schemes, and assessed against the explicit run and against sparse station observations. The parameterization succeeds in capturing the geographical distribution and seasonal cycle of convective dust storms. It can be tuned to different horizontal resolutions and convection schemes, although the details of the geographical distribution and seasonal cycle depend on the representation of the monsoon in the parent model. Different versions of the parameterization are further discussed with respect to differences in the frequency of extreme events. The results show that the parameterization is reliable and can therefore solve a long-standing problem in simulating dust storms in large-scale weather and climate models.",

            "abstract": "Leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf lifespan (LL) are two highly correlated plant traits that are key to plant physiological and ecological properties. Usually, low LMA means short LL, high nitrogen (N) content per unit mass, and fast turnover rates of nutrients; high LMA leads to long LL, low N content, and slow turnover rates. Deciduous trees with low LMA and short lifespan leaves have low carbon cost but high nitrogen demand; and evergreen trees, with high LMA and long lifespan leaves, have high carbon cost but low nitrogen demand. These relationships lead to: 1) evergreen trees have higher leaf area index than deciduous trees; 2) evergreen trees’ carbon use efficiency is lower than the deciduous trees’ because of their thick leaves and therefore high maintenance respiration; 3) the advantage of evergreens trees brought by their extra leaves over deciduous trees diminishes with increase N in ecosystem. These facts determine who will win when trees compete with each other in a N-limited ecosystem. In this study, we formulate a mathematical model according to the relationships between LMA, LL, leaf nitrogen, and leaf building and maintenance cost, where LMA is the fundamental variable determining the other three. We analyze the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) of LMA with this mathematical model by examining the benefits of carbon and nitrogen investments to leaves in ecosystems with different N. The model shows the ESS converges to low LMA at high N and high LMA at low N. At intermediate N, there are two ESSs at low and high ends of LMA, respectively. The ESS also leads to low forest productivity by outcompeting the possible high productive strategies. We design a simulation scheme in an individual-based competition model (LM3-PPA) to simulate forest dynamics as results of the competition between deciduous and evergreen trees in three different biomes, which are temperate deciduous forest, deciduous-evergreen mixed forest, and boreal evergreen forest. The simulated results are consistent with the actual forests. Our model and simulated results indicate the distribution of evergreen and deciduous forests can be explained by one single leaf trait (i.e., LMA) and associated physiological and biogeochemical processes.",

In particular, we study the effects of flow-focusing in high permeability inclusions and of helical flow in three-dimensional spatially non-stationary heterogeneous porous media. We perform tracer laboratory experiments in fully three-dimensional homogeneous and heterogeneous systems at different flow velocities (1, 3 and 5 m/day). Fluorescein and dissolved oxygen were used as conservative tracers. In the case of flow-focusing, the outcomes of fully 3-D experiments were compared with the results of analogous experiments performed in a quasi 2-D setup. We experimentally quantify dilution by determining the flux-related dilution index using flow rates and concentrations measured at the inlet and the outlet ports. Forward numerical simulations were used to interpret the experimental observations. The results show that dilution is enhanced due to flow-focusing in high-permeability inclusions and by helical flow. However, the degree of dilution enhancement by flow-focusing is dependent on the spatial arrangement of the high-permeability inclusions. Furthermore, although dilution is stronger in three-dimensional than in two-dimensional systems, dilution enhancement due to flow-focusing is more effective in two-dimensional heterogeneous porous media. Finally, helical flow produced by the macroscopically anisotropic porous media entails twisting of streamlines, which increases the lateral mass exchange and thus considerably enhances plume dilution.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic layer dynamics strongly affect boreal forest development after fire. Field studies show that soil organic layer thickness exerts a species-specific control on propagule establishment in the North American boreal forest. On organic soils thicker than a few centimeters, all propagules are less able to recruit, but broadleaf trees recruit less effectively than needleleaf trees. In turn, forest growth controls organic layer accumulation through modulating litter input and litter quality. These dynamics have not been fully incorporated into models, but may be essential for accurate projections of ecosystem carbon storage. Here, we develop a data-constrained model for understanding boreal forest development after fire. We update the ED2 model to include new aspen and black spruce species-types, species-specific propagule survivorship dependent on soil organic layer depth, species-specific litter decay rates, dynamically accumulating moss and soil organic layers, and nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria associated with moss. The model is validated against diverse observations ranging from monthly to centennial timescales and spanning a climate gradient in Alaska, central Canada, and Quebec. We then quantify differences in forest development that result from changes in organic layer accumulation, temperature, and nitrogen. We find that (1) the model accurately reproduces a range of observations throughout the North American boreal forest; (2) the presence of a thick organic layer results in decreased decomposition and decreased aboveground productivity, effects that can increase or decrease ecosystem carbon uptake depending on location-specific attributes; (3) with a mean warming of 4°C, some forests switch from undergoing succession to needleleaf forests to recruiting multiple cohorts of broadleaf trees, decreasing ecosystem accumulation by ~30% after 300 years; (4) the availability of nitrogen regulates successional dynamics such than broadleaf species are less able to compete with needleleaf trees under low nitrogen regimes. We conclude that a joint regulation between the soil organic layer, temperature, and nitrogen will likely play an important role in influencing boreal forests development after fire in future climates, and should be represented in models.",

            "abstract": "Assessment of vegetation structure via remote sensing modalities has a long history for a range of sensor platforms. Imaging spectroscopy, while often used for biochemical measurements, also applies to structural assessment in that the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), for instance, will provide an opportunity to monitor the global ecosystem. Establishing the linkage between HyspIRI data and sub-pixel vegetation structural variation therefore is of keen interest to the remote sensing and ecology communities. NASA's AVIRIS-C was used to collect airborne data during the 2013-2015 time frame, while ground truth data were limited to 2013 due to time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of field data collection. We augmented the available field data with a first-principles, physics-based simulation approach to refine our field efforts and to maintain larger control over within-pixel variation and associated assessments.\nThree virtual scenes were constructed for the study, corresponding to the actual vegetation structure of the NEON’s Pacific Southwest site (Fresno, CA). They presented three typical forest types: oak savanna, dense coniferous forest, and conifer manzanita mixed forest. Airborne spectrometer and a field leaf area index sensor were simulated over these scenes using the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) Model, a synthetic image generation model. After verifying the geometrical parameters and physical model with those replicative senses, more scenes could be constructed by changing one or more vegetation structural parameters, such as forest density, tree species, size, location, and within-pixel distribution.\nWe constructed regression models of leaf area index (LAI, R2=0.92) and forest density(R2=0.97) with narrow-band vegetation indices through simulation. Those models can be used to improve the HyspIRI’s suitability for consistent global vegetation structural assessments. The virtual scene and model can also be used in other studies, for example, to investigate the impact of human activities on ecosystems using imaging spectroscopy. More detailed results will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "This paper uses an advanced CGE model (Taheripour et al., 2013) coupled with hydrological projections of future water scarcity and biophysical data on likely crop yields under climate change to examine how water scarcity, climate change, and trade jointly alter land use changes across the Indian subcontinent. Climate shocks to rainfed and irrigated yields in 2030 are based on the p-DSSAT crop model, RCP 2.6, as reported under the AgMIP project (Rosenzweig et al., 2013), accessed through GEOSHARE (Villoria et al, 2014). Results show that, when water scarcity is ignored, irrigated areas grow in the wake of climate change as the returns to irrigation rise faster than for rainfed uses of land within a given agro-ecological zone. When non-agricultural competition for future water use, as well as anticipated supply side limitations are brought into play (Rosegrant et al., 2013), the opportunity cost of water rises across all river basins, with the increase ranging from 12% (Luni) to 44% (Brahmaputra). As a consequence, irrigated crop production is curtailed in most regions (Figure 1), with the largest reductions coming in the most water intensive crops, namely rice and wheat. By reducing irrigated area, which tends to have much higher yields, the combined effects of water scarcity and climate impacts require an increase in total cropped area, which rises by about 240,000 ha. The majority of this area expansion occurs in the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmari river basins.\nOverall crop output falls by about $2 billion, relative to the 2030 baseline, with imports rising by about $570 million. The combined effects of climate change and water scarcity for irrigation also have macro-economic consequences, resulting in a 0.28% reduction in GDP and an increase in the consumer price index by about 0.4% in 2030, compared the baseline. The national welfare impact on India amounts to roughly $3 billion (at 2007 prices) in 2030. Assuming a 3% social discount rate, the net present value of the annual reductions in welfare will be about $24.3 billion for 2008 to 2030.\nThis study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between climate and water availability in assessments of food security.",

            "abstract": "Unstructured meshes allow for inclusion of arbitrary surface topography, complex acquisition geometry and undulating geological interfaces in the inversion of geophysical data. This flexibility opens new opportunities for coupling different geophysical and hydrological data sets in constrained and joint inversions. For example, incorporating geological interfaces that have been derived from high-resolution geophysical data (e.g., ground penetrating radar) can add geological constraints to inversions of electrical resistivity data. These constraints can be critical for a hydrogeological interpretation of the inversion results. For time-lapse inversions of geophysical data, constraints can be derived from hydrological point measurements in boreholes, but it is difficult to include these hard constraints in the inversion of electrical resistivity monitoring data. Especially mesh density and the regularization footprint around the hydrological point measurements are important for an improved inversion compared to the unconstrained case. With the help of synthetic and field examples, we analyze how regularization and coupling operators should be chosen for time-lapse inversions constrained by point measurements and for joint inversions of geophysical data in order to take full advantage of the flexibility of unstructured meshes. For the case of constraining to point measurements, it is important to choose a regularization operator that extends beyond the neighboring cells and the uncertainty in the point measurements needs to be accounted for. For joint inversion, the choice of the regularization depends on the expected subsurface heterogeneity and the cell size of the parameter mesh.",

            "abstract": "Direct sampling of the subglacial environment is costly, and will therefore never supply the spatial coverage needed to determine the basal boundary conditions required for large-scale ice-sheet modeling. Studies of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) show that the frictional and rheologic properties of the bed are a leading control on the evolution of the system, so developing geophysical methods to help constrain the basal characteristics of WAIS will reduce uncertainty in predictions of the timing and magnitude of future sea-level rise. Radar-imaged structures within the ice are an attractive data set for this pursuit, as they contain information about the flow dynamics that transform the horizontally deposited layers to their modern configuration; however, they can be challenging to interpret, given the number of processes acting to deform the internal layers and the difficulty in automating their analysis. In this study, we move away from the layer-tracing paradigm in favor of an automated slope extraction algorithm. This has several advantages: it does not require feature-continuity, providing a more stable result in regions of intense deformation, and it results in a data product that maps directly to model output. For steady-state features, layer slopes reflect the horizontal and vertical velocity structure, making quantitative comparison of the model and observations simple compared to the more qualitative, particle tracer comparisons done in the past. Using a higher order ice-flow model, we attempt to refine our understanding of basal properties using reflector slope fields at the grounding line of Whillans Ice Stream and the shear margin of the North East Greenland Ice Stream, with the hope of eventually using this method for basin-scale inversions.",

            "abstract": "During the last decade, the successful operation of the dedicated satellite missions GOCE and GRACE have revolutionized our picture of the Earth’s gravity field. They delivered static global gravity field maps with high and homogeneous accuracy for spatial length-scales down to 70-80 km. The current satellite-only models of the fifth generation including GOCE data have reached accuracies of about 2 cm in geoid height and less than 0.7 mGal in gravity anomalies at 100 km spatial half-wavelength.\nHowever, the spatial resolution of gravity models derived from satellite data is limited. Since precise knowledge of the Earth’s gravity field structure with very high resolution is essential in solid Earth applications such as lithospheric modelling, geological interpretation and exploration geophysics, satellite-only models are complemented by combined gravity field models, which contain very high-resolution gravity field information obtained by terrestrial gravity measurements over continents, and satellite altimetry over the oceans. To further increase the spatial resolution beyond 10-20 km, measured terrestrial and satellite data can also be augmented by high-resolution gravity field signals synthesized from topographic models.\nIn this contribution an overview of the construction of satellite-only and combined global gravity field models is given. The specific characteristics of the individual input data and the resulting models will be assessed, and their impact for geophysical modelling will be discussed. On the basis of selected case studies, commission and omission errors and thus the contribution and impact of satellite gravity data on gravity field applications will be quantified, and the benefit of current satellite gravity data shall be investigated and demonstrated.\nFuture gravity field missions beyond GRACE Follow-On will provide global gravity field information with further increased accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution. In an international initiative consolidated science and user needs for a next-generation gravity field mission for such a sustained future satellite gravity observation infrastructure have been defined. These requirements will be discussed with focus on solid Earth applications, and the added value compared to the present situation will be quantified.",

            "abstract": "Reaction fronts are surfaces separating relatively unreacted from reacted material; the speed they migrate will sometimes control overall metamorphic reaction rate. For dehydration reactions their behaviour is controlled by small scale reaction rate coupled to evolving pressure and porosity. I derive a “steady state” solution for migration speed in which the profiles of fluid pressure and porosity do not evolve in shape, but move at a fixed speed, assuming a rigid porous matrix and incompressible fluid. I assume an externally controlled fluid pressure on one side of the front (in reality in a fracture for example) which controls overall disequilibrium. Reaction front speed is then faster (in a predictable way) for greater disequilibrium, but is also sensitive to initial porosity. There are 2 length (time) scales – a short one over which fluid pressure drops to near the external pressure then, after that, a longer one for reaction to complete. This analysis is useful because it gives a quantitative overview of what controls reaction front speed. More detailed non-steady state numerical models have also been constructed but it is less easy to appreciate why the models evolve in the way they do. The overall reaction rate in a fractured rock mass will be influenced by fracture spacing and local reaction rate, depending on the reaction front speed.",

            "abstract": "NSF REU site programs provide remarkable opportunities for students to experience first-hand the challenges and rewards of science research. Because REU positions are relatively scarce, applicant pools are large, and it is easy to fill available positions with students who already have well-developed research skills and proven abilities to excel academically. Advisors bringing REU participants into their labs may see this as the ideal situation. However, using experience and academic record as the primary selection criteria ignores an enormous pool of talented students who have simply never been in a position to show, or discover themselves, what they can do. Reaching this audience requires a shift in strategy: recruiting in ways that reach students who are unaware of REU opportunities; adjusting our selection criteria to look beyond academics and experience, putting as much emphasis on future potential as we do on past performance; finding, or developing, mentors who share this broader vision of working with students; and providing an institutional culture that ensure every student has the kind of multi-node support network that maximizes his or her success. REU programs should be primary tools to developing a deeper and broader science workforce. Achieving that goal will require innovative approaches to finding, recruiting, and mentoring participants.",

            "abstract": "Subliquidus rheology of a trachybasaltic lava was measured in the laboratory for the first time. Field observations of the parent flow focused on surface morphology characterization, which was later quantified in terms of surface roughness. The studied lava flow was emitted during the Holocene by a monogenetic cinder cone in the Cima Volcanic Field (CA). Surface morphology transitions from smooth pahoehoe ropes near the vent to jagged `a`a blocks over the majority of the flow. A variety of 2 m2 outcrops were photographed using a hand-held DSLR camera, and their surface texture was reconstructed with photogrammetry. The roughness of each outcrop, effectively described by the standard deviation between the real photogrammetric point cloud and the best-fitting surface, was quantified at different spatial scales, ranging from 0.5 cm to 200 m. We found that the roughness of the flow increases linearly as spatial resolution decreases, with a slope break corresponding to the average size of the outcrop lava blocks. The rheology of Cima lavas was determined by concentric cylinder viscometry in the 1220 °C to 1160 °C temperature range. The obtained rheological flow curves indicate a Bingham rheology, with clearly detected yield strength ranging from 25 Pa at the higher temperatures up to 650 Pa at the lower temperatures. Plagioclase crystallization begins at 1170 °C, likely playing a key role in promoting yield strength escalation. Viscosity increases by one order of magnitude (from 94 to 1116 Pa·s) over the 60 °C span of cooling considered, remaining consistently lower than most basaltic melts due to the high alkali content (6 wt%). The rheological and morphological results are being integrated, in order to assess if it is possible to identify the rheological fingerprint of the active flow on the preserved flow morphology. The composition-dependence of the morphological pahoehoe to `a`a transition in a rheological map is being assessed by comparing our results to literature data on Mauna Ulu. Preliminary data suggest that such transition occurs at lower temperatures for trachybasalts than it does for basalts.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved iodine in seawater is present as two chemical species: iodide or iodate in anoxic and oxygenated environments, respectively. Because only iodate can be incorporated into the carbonate structure, I/Ca values in marine carbonate and fossils potentially record seawater iodate concentrations. I/Ca has been used as a paleo-proxy for ocean oxygenation across different time scales, ranging from glacial–interglacial cycles to the abrupt warming and/or oceanic anoxic events of the Meso- and Cenozoic to long-term redox evolution during the Precambrian.\nHere we present a compilation of new and published I/Ca data for the Phanerozoic Eon showing a major increase of I/Ca at about 200 Ma, close to the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. This major change post-dates the rise of other paleo-oxygenation indicators, specifically increasing Mo-isotope compositions during the Devonian (Dahl et al., 2010) and the modeled increase in seawater sulfate concentrations in Carboniferous-Permian (Algeo et al., 2015).\nI/Ca is more sensitive to the level of dissolved O2 because the redox potential of iodate closely resembles that of O2. By contrast, Mo and S proxies are sensitive to more strongly reducing conditions, specifically the global distribution euxinia in the oceans. The increase of I/Ca in our compilation may indicate that the volume of oxygenated seawater expanded globally to near-modern levels around 200 Ma, which is also the time pelagic calcifiers proliferated (Zeebe and Westbroek, 2003). These planktonic organisms might have shifted the O2 consumption pattern and nutrient cycle, leading to the final oxygenation of ocean interiors.\nFundamental changes in global cycling of redox sensitive elements (Mo, S, I) also coincide with diversification of marine invertebrates (Alroy et al., 2008). These observations highlight that stepwise oxygenation of global oceans and the co-evolution of life may have been a protracted process spanning two-thirds of the Phanerozoic.\n",

            "abstract": "A hydrology approach based on the intercomparisons of multiple-product-driven hydrological simulations was implemented for reliably evaluating both quantitative precipitation estimations (QPE) and hydrological modelling at river basin and subbasin scales in the IFloodS focal basin, Iowa-Cedar River Basin (ICRB), over a long-term (2002-2013) and a short-term period (Apr. 1-June 30, 2013). A reference precipitation dataset was created for the evaluation first by reversing the mean annual precipitation from independent observed streamflow and satellite-based ET product and then it was disaggregated to 3-hourly time steps based on NLDAS2. The intercomparisons from different perspectives consistently showed the QPE products with less bias leaded to better streamflow simulation. The reference dataset leaded to overall the best model performance, slightly better than original NLDAS2 (biased -4%) which derived better model performance than all other products in the long-term simulations with daily and monthly NSC of 0.81 and 0.88 respectively and MARE of -2% when compared to observed streamflow at the ICRB outlet, while having reasonable water budgets simulation. Other products (CPC-U, StageIV and TMPARP and satellite-only products) derived gradually decreased performance. All products with long-term records showed consistent merit over the IFloodS period, while the Q2 seemed to be the best estimation for the short-term period. Good correlation between the bias in precipitation and streamflow was found at all from annual to daily scales while the relation and the slope depended on seasons, river basin concentration (routing) time and antecedent river basin water storage condition. Precipitation products also showed significant impacts on streamflow and peak timing. Although satellite-only products could derive even better simulations (than conventional products) for some sub-basins from the short-term evaluation, it had less temporal-spatial quality consistency. While the new GPM IMERG data are expected to bring further improvement of the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS), such streamflow-precipitation bias relationship can provide GFMS users of uncertainty estimation for ongoing flood events when real-time validation information is not available.",

            "abstract": "Nyiragongo volcano is the most active African volcano and among the most active volcanoes on Earth. It is also among the infrequent volcanoes that host a long-lived lava lake. The morphology of the Nyiragongo main crater is characterized by 2 levels of remnant platforms partly preserved and attached to its inner flanks, which correspond to former lava lake levels, and by a bottom “active” platform, which delimits the current active lava lake. The elevation of the bottom platform increases through time, with successive lava lake overflows. After a period of low level between late 2010 and August 2011, the lava lake next came back to its highest level. However, on September 30, 2011, it started a long and progressive fall, reaching ~70 m below the bottom platform in July 2014. This recent evolution of the lava lake, which occurred at the same time period as eruptive events at the neighboring Nyamulagira volcano, was accompanied by a ground subsidence of the bottom platform, leading to the appearance of ring fissures. This ground deformation is restricted to the bottom platform and, hence, suggests a very shallow source for the observed movement. All these changes in the Nyiragongo main crater were recorded by time-series of photographs, allowing the 3D reconstruction of the crater using close-range photogrammetric techniques and, hence, a detailed measurement of the observed changes. The ground subsidence was also recorded by time-series of RADARSAT-2 and CosmoSky-Med SAR interferograms, providing more detailed information on the velocity of deformation. Based on field data and the photogrammetric and InSAR time-series measurements, several hypotheses on the cause(s) of these changes in the Nyiragongo crater are discussed. The present work also highlights the potential of close-range photogrammetry and high-resolution InSAR to study and monitor active volcanoes in Equatorial environment.",

            "abstract": "During post-injection stage of geological carbon sequestration the primary forces governing CO2 migration and entrapment are capillarity and buoyancy, raising doubts about the applicability of conventional Darcy-based flow simulators to predict plume saturation in such flow regimes. Moreover, evaluating the impact of geological heterogeneity at the cm-to-m scale is hindered by the computational cost of highly resolved geological models. This limitation is overcome by the ability of invasion-percolation models to rapidly simulate flow through complex geometries with strong contrasts in capillary threshold pressure. The current investigation originates from a previous study conducted on 2-D flow simulations of CO2 invasion through stochastic and natural geologic models. This work addresses the influence of 3-D sedimentary structures and their variation in threshold capillary pressure on CO2 plume distribution with the goal of developing a predictive method for volumetric storage capacity. A set of invasion-percolation simulations is performed in an attempt to identify emergent behavior related to capillary trapping capacity of CO2 in brine-bearing sedimentary formations. Realistic depositional facies are generated with an existing Matlab code that relates the geometry of cross-bedding to the morphology of bedforms. Resulting 3-D binary models consist of matrix and lamina populated independently with probability density functions representative of sandstone facies with different grain size and sorting. Interpretation of numerical simulations reveals a correlation between percentage of model volume invaded by the plume and contrast in capillary threshold pressures of matrix and lamina, suggesting some predictive ability is achievable.",

The site is located over a complex mountainous terrain and the measurements made with Radar Wind Profiler (RWP), ultrasonic anemometer at two levels and a micro pulse LiDAR are being incorporated in this study. Measurement of local BL has been conducted using 1290 MHz radar wind profiler (RWP) as a part of major field campaign, GVAX. The RWP provides 24 hour diurnal cycle of the BL dynamical state over the site. The general criterion of peak in SNR profile being considered as mixed layer (ML) height was found to be inadequate. Therefore, a new approach is implemented according to which the region of SNR above 6 dB was taken as ML. The maxima in monthly-mean ML height is observed to vary from 557 ± 200 m in November (late autumn) to 912 ± 318 m during March (early spring). As a continuation of this study we have attempted to understand the micrometeorology of the site with fast-response measurements (25 Hz) of temperature and wind at two levels above ground using ultrasonic anemometer. These observations are used to derive diurnal variations of surface layer micro-meteorological parameters during fair-weather conditions. Turbulence and gust characteristics of wind over the site have also been parameterized to provide input for dispersion modeling and understand aerosol distribution over the Himalayas. These observations are consolidated with observations of aerosol vertical distribution made with LIDAR for 2 years, identifying the influences on aerosol loadings from IGP via BL evolution and convective mixing. A strong seasonality in aerosol vertical profile within lower 4 km is observed. Finally, these measurements are used to evaluate high resolution (5 km x 5 km) simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Model simulated and measured BL heights are generally seen within 1-sigma variations, indicating reasonable agreement from November to February. However, mean bias in daytime BL height is very high towards the start of spring (+637.6 m in March), as compared to late autumn and winter (-127.1 to +59.1 m), highlighting the need of yearlong BL measurements over this highly complex terrain.",

The position and velocity of terrestrial stations have been estimated using GNSS data series based on daily solutions. So, currently it is possible to analyse the GNSS coordinates time series aiming to improve the functional and stochastic models what can help better understand geodynamical phenomenon. Several sources of errors are mathematically modelled or estimated in the GNSS data processing to obtain accurate coordinates what in general is carried out by using scientific software. However, due to impossibility to model all errors some kind of noises can remain contaminating the coordinate time series, especially those related with seasonal effects. The noise affecting GNSS coordinate time series can be composed by white and coloured noises what can be characterized from Variance Component Estimation technique through Least Squares Method. Experiments were carried out by using GNSS time series for few Brazilian stations considering almost ten years of daily solutions. The results showed that the adoption of an adequate stochastic model considering the noises variances of time series can produce more realistic and reliable functional model for GNSS coordinate time series. Applications that will be based on such serie of coordinates will have more reliable assessments.",

            "abstract": "H2O and F contents affect many physical and chemical properties of the upper mantle, including melting temperature and viscosity. These elements are hosted by hydrous and F-rich phases, and by modally abundant, nominally-anhydrous/halogen-free mantle minerals, which can potentially accommodate the entire volatile budget of the upper mantle. We present high-precision SIMS analyses of H2O, and F in mantle xenoliths hosted by recently-erupted (5-10 Ka) alkali basalts from south Patagonia (Pali Aike) and older (c. 25 Ma) alkali basalts from localities along the Antarctic Peninsula. Samples are well characterised peridotites and pyroxenites, from a range of depths in the off-craton lithospheric mantle. Minerals are relatively dry: H2O contents of olivine span 0-49 ppm, orthopyroxene 150-235 ppm and clinopyroxene 100-395 ppm, with highest concentrations found in spinel-garnet lherzolites from Pali Aike. These H2O concentrations fall within the global measured range for off-craton mantle minerals. H2O and F are correlated, and the relative compatibility of F in mantle phases is clinopyroxene>orthopyroxene>olivine. However, elevated F concentrations of 100-210 ppm are found in pyroxenites from two Antarctic localities. This elevated F content is not correlated with high H2O, suggesting that these rocks interacted with a F-rich melt. In clinopyroxenes, F concentration is correlated with Ti, and the ratio of M1Ti to M1Al + M1Cr, suggesting a charge balanced substitution.\nConsistency between samples (excepting high-F pyroxenites) suggests a constant F-budget, and that concentrations in clinopyroxenes are controlled by mineral chemistry. In orthopyroxene, F correlates with CaO, but no other major or minor elements. Large variability of H2O concentrations within samples is attributed to diffusive loss during ascent. Cl is negligible in all samples, indicating little or no influence of slab fluids from this long-lived subduction zone.",

These large-scale observations of Arctic sea ice thickness are required to determine trends, compare hemispheres and aid predictive models of future global climate change. However, the final ESA data product is not available until ~30 days after the satellite acquisition, and as such the use of the data for near real time (NRT), operational purposes, has not been possible.\nAt University College London (UCL) we now produce the first NRT estimates of Arctic sea ice thickness, with a lag of only 2 days, using NRT data that has recently been released by ESA. This original, operational dataset will benefit industries such as transport and tourism, as well as the scientific community. This presentation will summarise the NRT product and the data that is avilable, investigate the differences between the NRT and final product, and analyse its reliability and data coverage in particular regions of interest (e.g. the Northwest Passage, and the Beaufort Sea).\nWe have also developed an Arctic-wide, time-varying snow load, so that our CryoSat-2 sea ice processing no longer relies on a constant monthly snow climatology. This presentation will summarise the development, application, and benefits of the new snow load in relation to our NRT and final sea ice thickness estimates.",

            "abstract": "We present a space-time stochastic weather generator for daily precipitation and temperature, developed within a Bayesian hierarchical framework (hereafter BayGEN). This framework offers a unique advantage: it provides robust estimation of uncertainty that is typically under-represented in traditional weather generators. Realistic estimates of uncertainty are of utmost importance for studying climate variability and change, impacts on land use, and crop production. BayGEN is applied to a network of weather stations in the Salado basin of the Argentine Pampas, a region that saw immense agricultural expansion towards climatically marginal (i.e., semi-arid) regions, in part due to significant trends in annual precipitation from 1970-2000. Since the turn of the century, observed conditions suggest a decrease in precipitation, which begs the question: \"Are the existing agricultural production systems viable in a drier future?\" The use of process based (i.e., hydrologic, crop simulation) models in conjunction with BayGEN will allow for complete analysis of the system's response to an ensemble of plausible future scenarios. Precipitation occurrence at each site is modeled at the first level of hierarchy using probit regression with covariates for seasonality, where the latent process is Gaussian -- positivity in the latent process implies occurrence. The precipitation amounts are modeled using a transformed gamma regression (i.e., gamma generalized linear model), similarly with seasonality covariates. Minimum and maximum temperatures are conditional on precipitation occurrence and are decomposed into two processes: (i) climate -- linear regressions on seasonality covariates, and (ii) weather -- realizations from mean-zero Gaussian random fields. The use of seasonality covariates allows the generation of daily weather sequences conditioned on seasonal forecasts or projected multi-annual trends, an increasingly important practice for risk assessment in climatically marginal regions. Posterior distributions of the regression and spatial parameters are used to conditionally simulate daily weather at observed locations and also on a regularly spaced grid (i.e., unobserved locations) for use in agriculture and hydrologic modeling.",

            "abstract": "δ13C and Δ14C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and aquatic plants from a karst spring and two spring-fed ponds in Laqiao, Maolan County, Guizhou Province in January, July and October of 2013 were measured to understand the roles of aquatic photosynthesis through DIC uptake in karst surface waters. The mean Δ14C and δ13C values of DIC for the spring pool, midstream and downstream ponds are -60.6±26.3‰ and -13.53±1.97‰, -62.8±62.9‰ and -11.72±2.72‰, and -54.2±56.5‰ and -9.40±2.03‰, respectively. Both Δ14C and δ13C show seasonal variations, with lower Δ14C values but heavier δ13C values in dry season and vice versa in summer rainy season. This observation indicates that (1) the main carbon source of the spring DIC is from limestone bedrock dissolution and soil CO2 with higher contribution in summer due to higher productivity; and (2) 13C and 14C have different behaviors during DIC uptake by aquatic plants and during CO2 exchange between DIC and the atmospheric CO2. Biological uptake of CO2 will not affect the Δ14C of DIC, but lead to δ13CDIC enrichment. CO2 exchange between DIC and the atmospheric CO2 should elevate both the Δ14C and δ13C of DIC. In Laqiao spring-pond system, it seems that the effect of biological uptake on the Δ14C and δ13C of DIC is much stronger than that of CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. The mean Δ14C values of POC from the spring pool, midstream and downstream ponds are -308.1 ±64.3‰, -164.4±84.4‰ and -195.1±108.5‰, respectively, indicating mixture of aquatic algae and detrital particle (clay and dust). More aquatic algae were formed in the stream ponds especially in the summer. SEM results of the POC samples support this conclusion. Furthermore, the Δ14C values of the submerged aquatic plants range from -200.0‰ to -51.3 ‰ and were similar to those of the DIC, indicating that the aquatic plants used DIC for photosynthesis. The Δ14C value of an emergent plant is -8.0±0.3‰, showing higher contribution of the atmospheric CO2 during photosynthesis.",

            "abstract": "An examination is made of the hypothesis that the statistics of magnetic-storm-maximum intensities are the realization of a log-normal stochastic process. Weighted least-squares and maximum-likelihood methods are used to fit log-normal functions to -Dst storm-time maxima for years 1957-2012; bootstrap analysis is used to established confidence limits on forecasts. Both methods provide fits that are reasonably consistent with the data; both methods also provide fits that are superior to those that can be made with a power-law function. In general, the maximum-likelihood method provides forecasts having tighter confidence intervals than those provided by weighted least-squares. From extrapolation of maximum-likelihood fits: a magnetic storm with intensity exceeding that of the 1859 Carrington event, -Dst > 850 nT, occurs about 1.13 times per century and a wide 95% confidence interval of [0.42, 2.41] times per century; a 100-yr magnetic storm is identified as having a –Dst > 880 nT (greater than Carrington) but a wide 95% confidence interval of [490, 1187] nT.

            "abstract": "Accurate picking of first arrival times plays an important role in many seismic studies, particularly in seismic tomography and reservoirs or aquifers monitoring. Many techniques have been developed for picking first arrivals automatically or semi-automatically, but most of them were developed for seismological purposes which does not attain the accuracy objectives due to the complexity of near surface structures, and to usual low signal-to-noise ratio. We propose a new adaptive algorithm for near surface data based on three picking methods, combining multi-nested windows (MNW), Higher Order Statistics (HOS), and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). They exploit the benefits of integrating many properties, which reveal the presence of first arrivals, to provide an efficient and robust first arrivals picking. This strategy mimics the human first-break picking, where at the beginning the global trend is defined. Then the exact first-breaks are searched in the vicinity of the now defined trend. In a multistage algorithm, three successive phases are launched, where each of them characterize a specific signal property. Within each phase, the potential picks and their error range are automatically estimated, and then used sequentially as leader in the following phase picking. The accuracy and robustness of the implemented algorithm are successfully validated on synthetic and real data which have special challenges for automatic pickers. The comparison of resulting P-wave arrival times with those picked manually, and other algorithms of automatic picking, demonstrated the reliable performance of the new scheme under different noisy conditions. All parameters of our multi-method algorithm are auto-adaptive thanks to the integration in series of each sub-algorithm results in the flow. Hence, it is nearly a parameter-free algorithm, which is straightforward to implement and demands low computational resources.",

Steve was known for being a great communicator and for his expertise in climate policy and solutions, along with being an outstanding scientist with many contributions to understanding the Earth’s climate system. One of the major challenges today to all of these areas is the changing trends in extreme weather under a changing climate. My focus in this presentation is to examine these issues by drawing on new research from my own team at Illinois. For example, climate change amplification in the Arctic has raised questions regarding its potential effects on extreme weather at mid-latitudes, especially the United States. In our studies, we find a statistically significant relationship between summer sea ice north of Alaska and geopotential height anomalies in the north Pacific during subsequent winter and spring months. The frequency of these semi-persistent height anomalies exhibits a long-term upward trend that amplify the jet stream off the West Coast of the U.S., driving more persistent precipitation patterns over certain regions of the United States, specifically in the West and Midwest parts of the country. Our results suggest that as sea ice in the Arctic north of Alaska continues to decrease, a more persistent ridge will form in areas adjacent to this location and affect storm tracks over the continental United States. In other studies, we are examining the effects of the changing climate on trends in extreme events throughout the continental U.S. We are also investigating changes in historical severe convective weather over the United States using reanalysis data, the NEXRAD/in situ gauge Climate Data Record (CDR) data set, and storm reports. After analyzing the ability of global climate models to represent the observed trends in severe-thunderstorm environments, projected future trends are also to be analyzed.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we present a simulation study of the convective instability (CI) which is excited in the presence of a negative temperature gradient in the dry troposphere. Using incompressible-inviscid hydrodynamic equations and laws of thermodynamics, we derive a growth equation for the wind wy, explicitly containing a growth term with frequency equals to the modified Brunt-Vaisala frequency (ωb) and a non-local term. A general expression for the modified Brunt-Vaisala frequency is derived for the dry-shallow troposphere, retaining the diabatic compression and non-linearity of the density (Diabatic-non-Boussinesq, DNB). This expression is also analyzed under adiabatic compressibility for two approaches: without the density linearizatin (Adiabatic-non-Boussinesq, ANB) and with the density linearization (Boussinesq, OB). The DNB approach is desirable in the dry troposphere where the environmental lapse rate (γe) is weaker than the adiabatic lapse rate (γad). Under the DNB approach, ωb is found to be modified from its OB counterpart such that stabilizing γad is replaced by a modified lapse rate (η-1) γac. Here, (γac,η) are the auto-convective lapse rate and the ratio of hydrostatic density to the total density. It is shown that under ANB approach, η becomes equal to the ratio of specific heats (γ). We show by simulation of the CI that as η increases from unity towards γ within a heated fluid parcel, the CI changes from DNB to ANB type and γe approaches toward γad. Notably, the CI growth remains positive during DNB phase for the initial temperature profile having γe < γad. The present study, thus, proposes an alternative mechanism for the positive growth of the CI under an initial adiabatically stable dry troposphere.",

            "abstract": "The thermal evolution and the strength of continents critically depend on the amount and vertical distribution of heat producing elements in the crust. In turn, these two crustal characteristics provide constraints on the origin of the crust and its internal differentiation processes. Neither of them can be determined directly and they must be inferred from geochemical and geophysical data. One method relies on global crustal models such as CRUST1.0 which gives the structure of the continental crustal column on a $1^{o}x1^{o}$ grid. The crustal model is made up of sedimentary layers over basement consisting of upper, middle, and lower crust whose thicknesses and physical properties vary between provinces depending on age and tectonic type. One may then plug in the average values of heat production for these crustal layers from global geochemical studies. An alternative method consists of measuring the surface heat flow and subtracting the estimated Moho heat flux.\nUsing the global crustal models, we have calculated the crustal heat production for the continents. We have also averaged and placed on the same worldwide grid all the land heat flow measurements. After removing the mantle heat flux and excluding the tectonically active regions, we have compared these two maps. On the global scale, the model based heat production map shows much less variability ($\\sigma = 7 mW~m^{-2}) than the map based on heat flow measurements ($\\sigma = 14 mW~m^{-2}). Adjusting the heat production values to fit the heat flux measurements can cancel the difference between the means, but does not reduce the root mean square difference between the two sets. On a regional scale, abundant heat flow in southeastern Canada allow a very detailed comparison. Long wavelength trends of the heat flux data set are obliterated by the model. We attempted to change the crustal heat production values but found that it is impossible to obtain a good fit. Even when considering only the Archean Superior Province, using a single set of heat production values in the crustal model fails to predict the long and short wavelength variations of the surface heat flux.\nIt is impossible to predict crustal heat production from a generic crustal model without accounting for lateral differences in crustal heat production between the main geological terranes of a province.",

            "abstract": "Unconventional oil production at the Bakken Shale of western North Dakota increased more than ten-fold from 2008 to 2014. Although unconventional oil production uses less water than conventional oil production per unit of energy, the cumulative water needs for unconventional oil production due to multiple drilling and fracturing operations may be locally or temporally significant. We collected and analyzed the data for a total of 8453 horizontal wells developed at Bakken in western North Dakota during 2007-2014.\nThe hydraulic fracturing activities mainly occurred in a core area of four counties, including Dunn, McKenzie, Mountrail, and Williams. The annual total water used for hydraulic fracking in western North Dakota increased from 302 ac-ft in 2007 to 21,605 ac-ft in 2014, by more than 70 times in 8 years. The four-county core area accounted for about 90% of total hydraulic fracturing water use in western North Dakota. Compared to the total water uses of all types, hydraulic fracturing water use in the four-county core area accounted for 0.7% in 2007 and 43.1% in 2014. Statewide, this percentage increased from 0.1% to 6.1% in the same time period.\nAs horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies matured for unconventional oil development at Bakken, the total depth and the total length of laterals per well seemed to reach an optimal value in the last four years (2011-2014). However, the number of fracturing stages and the volume of fracking water used per completion are still on the rise. The average water use per well increased from about 1.7 ac-ft in 2007 to 11.4 ac-ft in 2014. Correspondingly, the water intensity (volume of fracking water used per foot of laterals) increased from 67 gallon/ft in 2007 to about 372 gallon/ft 2014. The results helped us better understand the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing at Bakken and better manage the water resources in the region.",

            "abstract": "There is growing recognition that the space environment can have substantial, deleterious, impacts on society. Consequently, research enabling specification and forecasting of hazardous space effects has become of great importance and urgency. This research requires studying the entire Sun-Earth system to understand the coupling of regions all the way from the source of disturbances in the solar atmosphere to the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The traditional, region-based structure of research programs in Solar and Space physics is ill suited to fully support the change in research directions that the problem of space weather dictates. On the observational side, dense, distributed networks of observations are required to capture the full large-scale dynamics of the space environment. However, the cost of implementing these is typically prohibitive, especially for measurements in space. Thus, by necessity, the implementation of such new capabilities needs to build on creative and unconventional solutions. A particularly powerful idea is the utilization of new developments in data engineering and informatics research (big data). These new technologies make it possible to build systems that can collect and process huge amounts of noisy and inaccurate data and extract from them useful information. The shift in emphasis towards system level science for geospace also necessitates the development of large-scale and multi-scale models. The development of large-scale models capable of capturing the global dynamics of the Earth’s space environment requires investment in research team efforts that go beyond what can typically be funded under the traditional grants programs. This calls for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and efficient leveraging of resources both nationally and internationally. This presentation will provide an overview of current and planned initiatives, programs, and activities at the National Science Foundation pertaining to space weathe research.",

            "abstract": "Water withdrawals reported every five years by the US Geologic Survey (USGS) indicate that total freshwater withdrawals in the US have declined since 1980. Many interpretations have been offered to justify this finding. This decline in freshwater withdrawals is particularly perplexing considering a steadily increasing population trend. This topic is further complicated by climate change, constantly evolving urban environments, and subsequent cases of water shortage. This exploratory analysis examines regional variations of this national phenomenon by analyzing public supply freshwater withdrawals for the 25 most populous Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within each of the four regional divisions of the US, aggregated from county level data. Results indicate that there are distinct regional correlations in freshwater withdrawal and population. Case study cities within each region are selected from the data set for a multi-disciplinary analysis including: regional and local variation on freshwater withdrawals, implications on urban policy, and impacts on urban water acquisition.",

            "abstract": "This year marks the sesquicentennial anniversary of the end of the American Civil War. In 1865, the same year as the War’s end, the great American landscape artist, Frederic Edwin Church, unveiled Aurora Borealis, a painting that depicts a fantastic, far-northern place, an auroral arch stretched across a quiet night-time sky, above dark mountains and a frozen sea. Church was born in Connecticut, lived in New York, and traveled to Labrador; he would have often seen the northern lights. Church might have also been influenced by the spectacular displays of aurora that were caused by some unusually intense magnetic storms in 1859. Aurora Borealis can certainly be interpreted in terms of 19th-century romanticism, scientific philosophy, and Arctic missions of exploration, all subjects of interest to Church. As with so many of his paintings, Church’s meticulous attention to detail in Aurora Borealis reveals his deep admiration of nature. But his depiction of auroral light is a curious and possibly intentional departure from natural verisimilitude. Some art historians have suggested that Church painted Aurora Borealis as a subdued tribute to the end of the Civil War, with the drapery of auroral light forming an abstract representation of the American flag. If so, then colors of the flag have been unfurled across a cold and barren landscape, not in extravagant celebration, but in somber recognition of the reality of post-war desolation and an uncertain future.",

            "abstract": "Ore deposits often appear as disseminated sulfidic materials. Exploring these deposits with the Direct Current Resistivity (DCR) method alone is challenging because the resistivity signatures caused by disseminated material is often hard to detect. The Time-domain Induced Polarization (TDIP) method, on the other hand, is qualified to detect areas with disseminated sulfidic ores due to large electrode polarization effects which result in large chargeability anomalies. By employing both methods we gain information about both, the resistivity and the chargeability distribution of the subsurface.\nOn the poster we present the current state of the development of a 2D smoothness constraint inversion algorithm for DCR and TDIP data. The implemented forward algorithm uses a Finite Element approach with an unstructured mesh. The model parameters resistivity and chargeability are connected by either a simple conductivity pertubation approach or a complex conductivity approach.\nAs a case study, the 2D inversion results of DCR/TDIP and RMT data obtained during a survey on a sulfidic copper ore deposit in Turkey are presented. The presence of an ore deposit is indicated by areas with low resistivity and significantly high chargeability in the inversion models.\nThis work is part of the BMBF/TUEBITAK funded project ``Two-dimensional joint interpretation of Radiomagnetotellurics (RMT), Direct Current Resistivity (DCR) and Induced Polarization (IP) data: an example from ore exploration''.",

            "abstract": "Changing deposition chemistry, land use and climate induced impacts on hydrology will affect soil biogeochemistry and terrestrial C export and hence lake ecology with potential feedbacks for regional and global C cycling. Globally lakes bury and remineralise significant quantities of terrestrial C, and the associated flux of terrestrial C strongly influences their functioning. Primary production (autochthonous production) in lakes is based on dissolved inorganic C (DIC). DIC in alkaline lakes is partially derived from weathering of carbonaceous bedrock, a proportion of which is 14C-free. The low 14C activity yields an artificial age offset leading samples to appear hundreds to thousands of years older than their actual age. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) can contain terrestrial inputs. The terrestrial inputs can be labile or detrital; their age depends on their depth in catchment soil/peat stocks. We present a pilot study that uses the radiocarbon (∆14C) method to determine the source of carbon buried in the surface sediment of Lough Erne, a humic, alkaline lake in northwest Ireland. ∆14C, δ13C and δ15N values were measured from phytoplankton and other biota, dissolved inorganic, dissolved organic and particulate organic carbon. A novel radiocarbon method, Stepped Combustion1 was used to estimate the degree of the burial of terrestrial carbon in surface sediment. The ∆14C values of the low temperature fractions were comparable to algal ∆14C, while the high temperature fractions were 14C-depleted (older than bulk sediment). The ∆14C end-member model indicated that ~64% of carbon in surface sediment was derived from detrital terrestrial carbon. The use of ∆14C in conjunction with stepped combustion allows the quantification of the pathways of terrestrial carbon in the system, which has implications for regional and global carbon burial.\n1McGeehin, J., Burr, G.S., Jull, A.J.T., Reines, D., Gosse, J., Davis, P.T., Muhs, D., and Southon, J.R., 2001, Stepped-combustion C-14 dating of sediment: A comparison with established techniques: Radiocarbon, v. 43, p. 255-261.",

            "abstract": "The Jovian satellite Ganymede is the biggest moon of our solar system. One of the main motivation of our interest for this moon is its own intrinsic magnetic field, which has been discovered during the Galileo mission (Kivelson et al. 1996). The magnetic field of Ganymede directly interacts with the corotating jovian plasma, leading to the formation of a mini-magnetosphere which is embedded in the giant magnetosphere of Jupiter. This is the only known case of interaction between two planetary magnetospheres.\nIn the frame of the European space mission JUICE (Jupiter Icy moon Exploration), we investigate this unique interaction with a 3D parallel multi-species hybrid model. This model is based on the CAM-CL algorithm (Matthews 1994) and has been used to study the ionized environments of Titan, Mars and Mercury. In the hybrid formalism, ions are kinetically treated whereas electrons are considered as a zero-inertial fluid to ensure the quasi-neutrality of the plasma. The temporal evolution of the electromagnetic fields is calculated solving Maxwell's equations. The jovian magnetospheric plasma is described as being composed of oxygen and proton ions. The magnetic field of Ganymede, which includes dipolar and induced components (Kivelson et al, 2002), is distorted by its interaction with the Jovian plasma and formed the Alfvén wings. The planetary plasma is described as being composed of O+, with a scale height equal to 125 km. The description of the exosphere is provided by the 3D multi-species collisional exospheric/atmospheric model of Leblanc et al, (2015) and Turc et al. (2014). The ionization of this neutral exosphere by charge exchanges, by electronic impacts, and by reaction with solar photons contributes to the production of planetary plasma. In this model, calculations are performed on a cartesian simulation grid which is refined (down to ~120 km of spatial resolution) at Ganymede, using a multi-grids approach (Leclercq et al., submitted, 2015). Results are compared with Galileo observations obtained during the G1, G2 and G8 flybys.",

As such, understanding atmospheric waves, their variations with season, local time and location, and their impacts on the atmosphere is a key component of understanding the current state of the Martian upper atmosphere. Evidence of both small and large-scale atmospheric waves has been previously seen in observations of density, pressure, temperature and electron density at Mars. The Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) instrument onboard the MAVEN spacecraft is able measure the density of multiple different atmospheric species in situ at high temporal resolution. This unique dataset offers the ability to study the impacts of atmospheric waves on major and minor constituents, and reveal their impacts on the background atmosphere. Analysis of NGIMS data in the 150-250 km altitude region will be presented. The properties of atmospheric wave structures, their relation to the background atmospheric properties and their variations with time and location will be analyzed.

            "abstract": "There are two main theories for the origin of electron precipitation in the diffuse aurora: first, pitch angle scattering by electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves, and second, scattering by whistler mode waves. In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected from the plasmasheet to the loss-cone via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These secondary electrons can escape back to the magnetosphere, become trapped on closed magnetic field lines, and deposit their energy back to the inner magnetosphere. ECH and whistler mode waves can also move electrons in the opposite direction, from the loss cone into the trap zone, if the conjugate ionospheric sources of such electrons is located at the same field lines as the trapped magnetospheric electron population. In this talk, we will discuss secondary electron formation in regions of diffuse aurora in the presence of both ECH and whistler mode waves, taking into account multiple reflection of precipitated plasma sheet electrons. We also compare our modeled results for secondary electron fluxes with MMS data.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes geodetic observations of aseismic deformation in a thrust belt near Shahdad in eastern Iran, which have been used to place constraints on the rheology of creeping faults in a thin-skinned thrust belt. Creep on shallow and high-angle thrust ramps at the range-front occurs at a steady rate, in response to the topographic gradient across the thrust belt. Parts of these thrust ramps, and the low-angle basal thrust they connect to at depth in a ramp-and-flat geometry, underwent accelerated creep following the nearby Mw 6.6 Fandoqa earthquake in 1998. Estimates of the rate of fault slip and the driving stresses in these two contrasting times reveal a non-linear relationship between the stresses and sliding velocity. The degree of non-linearity rules out bulk shear of a weak layer in the sedimentary section (e.g. evaporites) as the deformation mechanism, and suggests that the motions are accommodated by slip on faults governed by a friction law with a rate or state dependence, or possibly both. The high-angle thrust ramps are responsible for building aspects of the geological and geomorphological signs of active shortening visible at the surface, but the folding preserved in the geology must be accomplished by other methods, possibly during the rapid transient postseismic deformation following nearby earthquakes.",

A high spatial resolution surface emissivity database is used to help differentiate surface emission and atmospheric moisture absorption.

            "abstract": "Hypotheses for the origin of crustal silicic magmas include both partial melting of basalts and fractional crystallization of mantle-derived melts[1]. Both are recognized as important processes in modern environments. When it comes to Archean rocks, however, partial melting hypotheses dominate the literature. Tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG)-type silicic magmas, ubiquitous in the Archean, are widely thought to be produced by partial melting of subducted, delaminated or otherwise deeply buried hydrated basalts[2]. The potential for a fractional crystallization origin for TTG-type magmas remains largely unexplored. To rectify this asymmetry in approaches to modern vs. ancient rocks, we have performed experiments at high pressures and temperatures to closely simulate fractional crystallization of a basaltic komatiite magma in the lowermost crust. These represent the first experimental determinations of the fractionation products of komatiite-type magmas at elevated pressures. The aim is to test the possibility of a genetic link between basaltic komatiites and TTGs, which are both magmas found predominantly in Archean terranes and less so in modern environments. We will present the 12-kbar fractionation paths of both Al-depleted and Al-undepleted basaltic komatiite magmas, and discuss their implications for the relative importance of magmatic fractionation vs. partial melting in producing more evolved, silicic magmas in the Archean.

Predicting surface charging of a vehicle in these environments depends on our ability to specify and forecast auroral acceleration events and geomagnetic storms. Measurements of ISS frame charging to date, in contrast, are dominated by US 160V solar array interactions with the ionospheric plasma environment with little evidence for strong charging during geomagnetic storms. Predicting ISS charging, therefore, requires an ability to specify and forecast components of ionospheric variability of importance to high voltage solar array interactions with the plasma environment. This presentation provides examples of the ionospheric conditions responsible for typical and extreme ISS charging and discusses current capabilities to forecast these events. Specific examples are given for ISS frame charging observed when the vehicle passes through low latitude dawn density depletions, high latitude plasma troughs, and plasma depletions associated with equatorial spread-f conditions.",

            "abstract": "The modification of aerosol optical properties due to interaction with fog is examined from measurements made by sun/sky radiometers at several AERONET sites. Retrieved total column volume size distributions for cases identified as aerosol modified by fog often show very a large ‘middle mode’ submicron radius (~0.4 to 0.5 microns), which is typically seen as a component of a bimodal sub-micron distribution. These middle mode sized particles are often called cloud-processed or residual aerosol. This bimodal accumulation mode distribution may be due to one mode (the larger one) from fog-processed aerosol and the other from interstitial aerosol, or possibly from two different aerosol species (differing chemical composition) with differing hygroscopic growth factors. The size of the fine mode particles from AERONET retrieved for these cases exceeds the size of sub-micron sized particles retrieved for nearly all other aerosol types, suggesting significant modification of aerosols within the fog or cloud environment. In-situ measured aerosol size distributions made during other fog events are compared to the AERONET retrievals, and show close agreement in the residual mode particle size. Almucantar retrievals are analyzed from the Kanpur site in the Indo-Gangetic Plain in India (fog in January), Beijing (fog in winter), Fresno, CA in the San Joaquin Valley (fog in winter), South Korea (Yellow Sea fog in spring), Arica on the northern coast of Chile (stratocumulus), and several other sites with aerosol observations made after fog dissipated.\nAdditionally, several major air pollution events are discussed where extremely high aerosol concentrations were measured at the surface and during which fog also occurred, resulting in the detection very large fine mode aerosols (residual mode) from AERONET retrievals in some of these events. Low wind speeds that occurred during these events were conducive to both pollutant accumulation and also fog formation. The presence of fog then increases the rates of gas-to particle conversion for sulfate, nitrate and organics, in addition to increasing the mass of existing particles due to fog processing and/or hygroscopic growth. All of these major air pollution events resulted in documented very large health impacts and were all covered extensively by the media in many countries.",

            "abstract": "Gorely is a shield-type volcano in southern Kamchatka currently in an eruptive phase [1] with prior eruptions recorded in 1980 and 1984 [4]. It is comprised of three main structural units: ancient (middle Pleistocene) edifice called ‘Old-Gorely’ volcano; thick ignimbrite complex, associated with a caldera forming eruption (40 ka); modern edifice named ‘Young Gorely’ growing inside the caldera [6]. Gorely lavas consist of a suite of compositions ranging from basalt to rhyolite (calk-alkaline series).In this study we describe the mixing processes in magma chamber [2] based on analysis of whole-rock and mineralogical data in an attempt to compare the magma evolution pathways for ‘Old Gorely’ and Young Gorely volcanoes. Our results indicate that fractional crystallization (FC) is the dominant process for ‘Old Gorely’ magmas, while ‘Young Gorely’ magmas are the result of mixing of primitive and evolved magmas in Gorely magma chamber], which is located at depth range from 2 to 10 km below the volcano edifice [6].\nWe present results of olivine high-precision electron microprobe data analysis (20kV, 300 nA) [7], alongside traditional methods (WR diagrams, mineral zonation) to demonstrate the difference between ‘Old’ (FC) and ‘Young’ (mixing) Gorely magmas. We estimated magma H2O (~3 wt.%) content for Gorely magma using independent methods: 1) using THI [8]; 2) using ΔT Ol-Pl [3]; 3) using Ol-Sp temperatures [9]. Additionally, calculations of [4] and analysis of olivine chemistry allow us to describe water content changes during magma evolution. We show that degassing (H2O removal) is necessary for strong plagioclase fractionation, which is observed in Gorely evolved lavas (less than 5 wt.% of MgO).\n[1] Aiuppa et al.

            "abstract": "When geographer Gilbert F. White founded the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado in 1975, he was adamant that the knowledge amassed by the research community be available to practitioners. Recognizing that it does not take an extreme event to produce extreme consequences, White argued for an equal emphasis on technologically-oriented solutions to natural hazards problems, alongside the social, economic, and political factors that lead to the non-adoption of the technological solutions, and then the translation of these findings into useful practices. In later writings (2001) he commented on the paradox of modern society in not achieving this balance suggesting that while we have more knowledge and abilities to manipulate nature, simultaneously we have increased our exposure and susceptibility to natural hazards through our own actions and development patterns.\nThis paper reviews the need for, status of, and role of integrated research on disaster risk in policy and practice. The reduction in economic and human loss requires such integrated knowledge on disaster risk, evidence-based policy appraisals, and more progressive approaches to hazards and disaster risk management. This means a re-framing of current programs and policies away from response to a more pro-active and longer term emphases on enhancing resilience at local to global scales. Linking hazards science and practice to larger societal and development objectives is the path toward a more resilient future, a goal that personifies the scholarship of Gilbert F. White.",

            "abstract": "The characterization of planetary exospheres today, relies on the development of a highly efficient ionization source, due to the scant neutral molecules (n < 108 cm -3) present in diffuse planetary coronae. These tenuous atmospheres provide insight on to physical processes known to occur such as: space weathering, magneto-atmosphere interactions, as well as atmospheric escape mechanisms, all of which are being heavily investigated via current 3D Monte Carlo simulations (Turc et al. 2014, Leblanc et al. 2016 in prep) at LATMOS. Validation of these studies will rely on in-situ observations in the coming decades. Neutral detection strongly depends on electron-impact ionization which via conventional cathode-sources, such as thermal filaments (heated up to 2000 K), may only produce the target ionization essential for energy-measurements with large power consumption. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) however are ideal low-power, cold cathodes, when subject to moderate electric fields (E ~ 1 MV / m). We present our current device, a small CNT chip, of emission area 15 mm2, emitting electrons that pass through an anode grid and subsequent electrostatic analyzer. The device currently extracts hundreds of µAmperes with applied external voltages ~ -150 Volts, approaching minimum power consumption < 0.1 Watts. The 3D modeling of field effect electrons ionizing a standard influx of neutrals is shown, using the multiphysics suite COMSOL. To better anticipate the species an ideal in-situ spacecraft equipped with such an ionization source would observe, we discuss Europa’s exosphere. Europa’s environment is largely shaped by the Jovian plasma sputtering the icy regolith with heavy ions and electrons (keV < E < MeV), producing predominately molecular oxygen (Johnson et al. 2002).",

            "abstract": "The trajectory of incoming storms from the Pacific Ocean is a key influence on drought and flood regimes in western North America. Flow is typically from the west in a zonal pattern, but decadal shifts between zonal and meridional flow have been identified as key features in hydroclimatic variability over the instrumental period. In Washington and most of the Pacific Northwest, there tend to be lower-latitude storm systems that result in decreased precipitation in El Niño years. However, the Columbia Basin in central Washington behaves in opposition to the surrounding region and typically has average to above-average precipitation in El Niño years due to changing storm-track trajectories and a decreasing rain shadow effect on the leeward side of the Cascades. This direct connection between storm-track position and precipitation patterns in Washington provided an exceptional opportunity for circulation-based field sampling and chronology development. New Pinus ponderosa (Ponderosa pine) tree-ring chronologies were developed from eight sites around the Columbia Basin in Washington and used to examine year-to-year changes in moisture regimes. Results show that these sites are representative of the two distinct climate response areas. The divergence points between these two site responses allowed us to reconstruct changing precipitation patterns since the late-17th century, and to link these patterns to previously reconstructed atmospheric pressure and El Niño indices. This study highlights the potential for using synoptic climatology to inform field-based proxy collection.",

            "abstract": "Envision a world where a field operator turns on an instrument, and is queried for information needed to create standardized encoded descriptions that, together with the sensor manufacturer knowledge, fully describe the capabilities, limitations and provenance of observational data. The Cross-Domain Observational Metadata Environmental Sensing Network (X-DOMES) pilot project (with support from the NSF/EarthCube IA) is taking the first steps needed in realizing this vision.\nThe knowledge of how an observable physical property becomes a measured observation must be captured at each stage of its creation. Each sensor-based observation is made through the use of applied technologies, each with specific limitations and capabilities. Environmental sensors typically provide a variety of options that can be configured differently for each unique deployment, affecting the observational results. By capturing the information (metadata) at each stage of its generation, a more complete and accurate description of data provenance can be communicated. By documenting the information in machine-harvestable, standards-based encodings, metadata can be shared across disciplinary and geopolitical boundaries. Using standards-based frameworks enables automated harvesting and translation to other community-adopted standards, which facilitates the use of shared tools and workflows.\nThe establishment of a cross-domain network of stakeholders (sensor manufacturers, data providers, domain experts, data centers), called the X-DOMES Network, provides a unifying voice for the specification of content and implementation of standards, as well as a central repository for sensor profiles, vocabularies, guidance and product vetting. The ability to easily share fully described observational data provides a better understanding of data provenance and enables the use of common data processing and assessment workflows, fostering a greater trust in our shared global resources. The X-DOMES Network capabilities will form the foundation for interoperable architectures designed to integrate and document observational data, thereby fostering their reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "Although river deltas only contribute 5% to the overall land surface, nearly six hundred million people live in these complex social-ecological environments, which combine a variety of appealing locational advantages. In many countries deltas provide the major national contribution to agricultural and industrial production. At the same time these already very dynamic environments are exposed to a variety of threats, including the disturbance and replacement of valuable ecosystems, increasing water, soil, and air pollution, human induced land subsidence, sea level rise, as well upstream developments impacting water and sediment supplies. A constant monitoring of delta systems is thus of utmost relevance for understanding past and current land surface change and anticipating possible future developments. We present the potential of Earth Observation based analyses and derived novel information products that can play a key role in this context. Along with the current trend of opening up numerous satellite data archives go increasing capabilities to explore big data. Whereas in past decades remote sensing data were analysed based on the spectral-reflectance-defined ‘finger print’ of individual surfaces, we mainly exploit the ‘temporal fingerprints’ of our land surface in novel pathways of data analyses at differing spatial-, and temporally-dense scales. Following our results on an Earth Observation based characterization of large deltas globally, we present in depth results from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, the Yellow River Delta in China, the Niger Delta in Nigeria, as well as additional deltas, focussing on the assessment of river delta flood and inundation dynamics, river delta coastline dynamics, delta morphology dynamics including the quantification of erosion and accretion processes, river delta land use change and trends, as well as the monitoring of compliance to environmental regulations.",

            "abstract": "Convective and synoptic processes play a major role in determining the transport and distribution of trace gases and aerosols in the troposphere. The representation of these processes in global models (at ~100-1000 km horizontal resolution) is challenging, because convection is a sub-grid process and needs to be parameterized, while synoptic processes are close to the grid scale. Depending on the parameterization schemes used in climate models, the role of convection in transporting trace gases and aerosols may vary from model to model. 222Rn is a chemically inert and radioactive gas constantly emitted from soil and has a half-life (3.8 days) comparable to synoptic timescale, which makes it an effective tracer for convective and synoptic transport. In this study, we evaluate the convective and synoptic transport in two chemical transport models (GMI and GEOS-Chem), both driven by the NASA’s MERRA reanalysis. Considering the uncertainties in 222Rn emissions, we incorporate two more recent scenarios with regionally varying 222Rn emissions into GEOS-Chem/MERRA and compare the simulation results with those using the relatively uniform 222Rn emissions in the standard model. We evaluate the global distribution and seasonality of 222Rn concentrations simulated by the two models against an extended collection of 222Rn observations from 1970s to 2010s. The intercomparison will improve our understanding of the spatial variability in global 222Rn emissions, including the suspected excessive 222Rn emissions in East Asia, and provide useful feedbacks on 222Rn emission models. We will assess 222Rn vertical distributions at different latitudes in the models using observations at surface sites and in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Results will be compared with previous models driven by other meteorological fields (e.g., fvGCM and GEOS4). Since the decay of 222Rn is the source of 210Pb, a useful radionuclide tracer attached to submicron aerosols, improved understanding of emissions and transport of 222Rn will provide insights into the transport, distribution, and wet deposition of 210Pb aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Cloud properties over East China are described based on observations from satellite (MODIS), ground site and aircraft. Based on satellite observations, 10-year averaged cloud fraction over the whole China region is around 66%, similar to the average value of global, with the largest cloud occurrence in Summer; the cloud fraction increases slightly during last 10 years; more clouds are found at southeast region than at northwest region; cloud droplet effective radius shows the smallest values around 10 um at mid-latitude regions and largest values at high latitude regions; further PDF analysis shows that cloud droplet effective radius demonstrates a bimodal distribution with maximum occurrences around 10-16 um. Ground site observations show that cloud fraction at Taihu site is around 65% for 2013, consistent with that found by MODIS at the closest grid to the site; more clouds are found at night than during day. In-situ aircraft observations over Huanghua city show that cloud droplet effective radius increases with height, with values from 3-5 um at low altitude, 7-9 um at mid altitude, to 10-13 um at high altitude. While the aircraft observation sample volume is limited, the in-situ observed cloud properties demonstrate that cloud droplet re increases with height, consistent with many findings by in-situ aircraft at other locations. The consistency of satellite observed cloud droplet re between East China and other regions is likely caused by the fact that the cloud properties observed by satellite is more representative of those clouds at high altitudes which are weakly affected by the aerosols within the boundary layers. On the other hand, the cloud droplet re at the cloud bases over East China is much smaller than those found at other locations, likely demonstrating the significant impacts by the heavy aerosol loadings at this region. Further studies with more site and aircraft observations over East China are needed.",

            "abstract": "A radiative transfer model (RTM) to calculate a snow brightness temperature (Tb) is a critical element to retrieve terrestrial snow from microwave remote sensing observations. The RTM simulates the Tb based on a layered snow by solving a set of microwave radiative transfer formulas. Even with the same snow physical inputs used for the RTM, currently existing models such as Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS), Dense Media Radiative Transfer (DMRT-Tsang), and Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) models produce different Tb responses. To backwardly invert snow physical properties from the Tb, the differences from the RTMs are to be quantitatively explained. To this end, the paper evaluates the sources of perturbations in the RTMs, and reveals the equations where the variations are made among three models. Investigations are conducted by providing the same but gradual changes in snow physical inputs such as snow grain size, and snow density to the 3 RTMs. Simulations are done with the frequencies consistent with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-E (AMSR-E) at 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. For realistic simulations, the 3 RTMs are simultaneously driven by the same snow physics model with the meteorological forcing datasets and are validated from the snow core samplings from the CLPX (Cold Land Processes Field Experiment) 2002-2003, and NoSREx (Nordic Snow Radar Experiment) 2009-2010.",

            "abstract": "The upward revision of the thermal conductivity in the Earth's core makes it\nplausible that the mean heat flow at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) could be only a\nfraction of what can be conducted down the core adiabat (perhaps one half). The upper\npart of the fluid core would be stably stratified to substantial depth. This is\ninconsistent with evidence for upwelling flow near the CMB from observations of\nof magnetic flux expulsion. Heat flow at the CMB is likely very heterogeneous and\nwould still be superadiabatic in some regions of the CMB. The dynamics of such a\nsystem is unclear. Gubbins et al. (Phys. Earth Planet. Int., in press, 2015)\nsuggest that the locally unstable gradient would mix up the stable layer as a whole\nand replace it by a weakly convecting one. We study dynamo models driven by a codensity\nflux from the inner core. On the outer boundary an inverse (on average) gradient is\nimposed, leading to stable stratification of the top 40% of the fluid shell. In\naddition to control cases with homogeneous CMB flux, we run models with two unstable\nregions centered on the equator. In the latter cases a predominantly horizontal\ncirculation in a thin layer immediately below the outer boundary redistributes\nthe heat that is conducted radially upward in the stable layer and transports it\ntowards the high heat-flow spots. Radial flow below these spots does not penetrate\ndeeply into the stable layer, nor does the layer become mixed up to a significant\ndegree. A dynamo operates in the convecting deep interior, however, its dipole\nmoment is low in comparison to the Earth value. Heat flow heterogeneity at the\nCMB does not sem to solve the problems that exist for the geodynamo when the\naverage heat flux is substantially subadiabatic.",

            "abstract": "During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT, ~900 kyrs ago), the climate system’s glacial/interglacial pacing, as reflected in benthic δ18O, changed from a dominant periodicity of 41,000 to one of 100,000 kyr, without a comparable change in orbital forcing. Proposed changes in the climate system that accompanied or could help explain this transition include an increase in the northern hemisphere and/or Antarctic ice volume, thermohaline circulation reorganization, and atmospheric pCO2 drawdown. Here we reconstruct bottom water temperature and δ18O of seawater (δ18Oseawater) from Mg/Ca and d18O signatures of Uvigerina spp., and carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]) from B/Ca values of Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi to evaluate changes in ice volume and deep ocean carbon storage. The study is based on North Pacific ODP Site 1208 (36.13°N, 158.20°W, 3350 m water depth) and covers Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 26 to 19 (~780-970 kyr). Our high-resolution (~2 kyrs) bottom water temperature record is largely in agreement with the high-resolution record from South Pacific ODP Site 1123 (Elderfield et al., 2012). At MIS 22, Site 1123 shows an abrupt 0.5 per mil δ18Oseawater increase that persists during subsequent glacial periods, interpreted by Elderfield et al. as a step-wise increase in glacial ice volume in Antarctica. By contrast, our preliminary Site 1208 δ18Oseawater record exhibits a transient increase in glacial δ18Oseawater at MIS 22, but suggests no significant, permanent glacial ice volume growth occurred. Preliminary low-resolution B/Ca results indicate a gradual and large decrease in [CO32-] from MIS 25 to MIS 21 at Site 1208, which may have been caused by a marked increase in deep ocean carbon storage over the MPT. Based on our preliminary analyses, we propose that thermohaline reorganization during the MPT may have changed deep ocean carbon storage and contributed to pCO2 drawdown.",

            "abstract": "The drilling sites of IODP 334 and 344 lie in the being subducted part of Cocos Ridge, offshore Costa Rica. Some seamount clusters distributed in the northwest side of the sites. Most scientists accepted that the Cocos ridge is intimately related to the activity of Galapagos plume (e.g., Hoernle et al., 2000, 2004, 2008). In this study we have selected some basaltic samples from U1381A, U1381C and U1414A (IODP 334 and 344) (Harris et al., 2015a, b) to carry out petrogenetic study. Major element compositions show that these basaltic rocks belong to sub-alkaline rocks, which is consistent with previous study on basalts from northern side of Cocos ridge. The characteristics of trace element composition are similar to that of EMORB, and the compositional differences in trace elements among samples reflect the influence of fractional crystallization. Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of these basaltic rocks show that there exist mantle heterogeneity beneath the Cocos ridge, and they may be the product of mixing between DMM/GSC and EMII. The new data show more enriched source feature than those from Galapagos hotspot (and its tracks) in previous study (Hoernle et al., 2000,2004), and slightly more enriched than those Miocene to Pliocene arc volcanics from Central America (Gazel et al., 2009). Partial melting model show that the parental basalts for these basaltic rocks may be produced by 13 to 28% partial melting of garnet pyroxenite.\n",

Our ability to observe landscapes and quantify topographic patterns has greatly improved, including the estimation of fluxes of mass and energy across landscapes. Challenges still remain in the analysis of high resolution topography data; the presence of features such as roads, for example, challenges classic methods for feature extraction and large data volumes require computationally efficient extraction and analysis methods. Moreover, opportunities exist to define new robust metrics of landscape characterization for landscape comparison and model validation.\nIn this presentation we cover recent research in multi-scale and objective analysis of high resolution topography data. We show how the analysis of the probability density function of topographic attributes such as slope, curvature, and topographic index contains useful information for feature localization and extraction. The analysis of how the distributions change across scales, quantified by the behavior of modal values and interquartile range, allows the identification of landscape characteristic scales, such as terrain roughness. The methods are introduced on synthetic signals in one and two dimensions and then applied to a variety of landscapes of different characteristics. Validation of the methods includes the analysis of modeled landscapes where the noise distribution is known and features of interest easily measured.",

            "abstract": "In an effort to untangle certain mechanisms contributing to the initiation of ENSO events, a coupled model framework is presented to isolate coupled instability induced SST error (or anomaly) growth in the ENSO region. The modeling framework using CCSM4 allows for seasonal ensembles of initialized simulations that are utilized to quantify the spatial and temporal behavior of coupled instabilities and the associated implications for ENSO predictability. The experimental design allows for unstable growth of initial perturbations that are not prescribed and several cases exhibit sufficiently rapid growth to produce ENSO events that do not require a previous ENSO event, large-scale wind trigger, or subsurface heat content precursor. Without these precursors, however, ENSO amplitude is reduced, suggesting that a combination of processes is essential to achieving peak amplitude in CCSM4. The results imply that even without classical precursors, including western Pacific “preconditioning,” ENSO events can be excited via coupled instabilities in fully coupled models. By removing the subsurface heat content precursor, however, essentially a lower bounds for ENSO predictability in CCSM4 is established, although seasonal ensembles initialized later in the calendar year retain some predictability.\nThe initial error growth exhibits strong seasonality with fastest growth during spring and summer and also dependence on the initialization month with fastest growth occurring in the July ensemble. The error growth displays a well-defined seasonal limit with ensembles initialized in the winter or spring exhibiting a clear seasonal halt in error growth around September, consistent with increased background stability typical during fall. Overall, dynamically driven error growth in CCSM4 is deemed best characterized by strong seasonality, dependence on the initialization month, and nonlinearity. The results pose real implications for predictability because the final error structure is ENSO-like and occurs without a subsurface precursor, which studies have shown to be essential to ENSO predictability.",

Tremors used in this study are tremors after the three following earthquakes. Data processing used to determine peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), peak ground displacement (PGD), spectral acceleration (SA), spectral velocity (SV), spectral displacement (SD), A/V ratio, acceleration amplification and effective duration (te). Then determine the natural frequency (f0) and peak of H/V ratio using H/V ratio method.\nThe earthquakes data processing result shows the value of peak ground motion, spectrum response, A/V ratio and acceleration amplification increases with height, while the value of the effective duration decreases. Then, tremors data processing result one month after each earthquakes shows the natural frequency of building in constant value. Increasing of peak ground motion, spectrum response, A/V ratio, acceleration amplification, then decrease of effective duration following the increase of building floors shows that the building construction supports the increasing of shaking and strongly influenced by local site effect. The constant value of building natural frequency shows the building still in good performance.

            "abstract": "Changes in forest cover are critical for the maintenance of the hydrological cycle in tropical forests and surrounding landscapes. Most evidence suggesting impacts of deforestation on river flows comes from local scale and short duration experiments, but these are largely prohibited in vast and inaccessible areas of the Amazon. Although rainfall-runoff models are commonly used to scale up deforestation effects to regional scales and multidecadal time ranges, most of these models assume static land use/land cover, excluding temporal variability in human disturbance in decadal long simulations. This presentation will present a study carried out in the Tapajos River in Brazil, a large basin in southeast Amazonia, where we aim to understand the role of human disturbance and vegetation dynamics on river flows. This study analyzed spatial and temporal trends in observed rainfall, forest cover, and river flow indicators for 1970s to 2000s. During this period, no significant changes occur in total annual rainfall, while over 140,000 km2 (35% of original cover) of forest were cleared. Contrary to the expected response following deforestation, 90-day minimum river flows showed a significant decrease though most gauges in the basin. In order to isolate deforestation effects, two contrasting scenarios were computed at a daily scale using the Ecosystem Demography Model 2 in combination with a water flow routing scheme; the first scenario incorporated natural disturbance resembling 1970 forest conditions, while the second scenario incorporated both natural and human disturbance (aka., land use conversion), the later as observed annually from the 1970s to the 2000s. We estimated that deforestation began affecting dry season flows in the early 1990s once less than 10% of the original forest cover was lost. Also, a potential effect of deforestation on the timing of rainfall-flow responses was also detected in the lower river gauges. While the estimated effects on timing are also noticed in the historical record, conflicting trends in dry season flow estimates imply that there might be other factors such as soil characteristics and small water impoundments that might be masking direct effects of deforestation on river flows.",

Mittelman, Amir Taghavy, Yonggang Wang, John D. Fortner, Daniele S. Lantagne, Linda M. Abriola and Kurt D. Pennell*\nDetailed knowledge of the processes governing nanoparticle transport and reactivity in porous media is essential for accurate predictions of environmental fate, water and wastewater treatment system performance, and assessment of potential risks to ecosystems and water supplies. To address these issues, an interdisciplinary research team combined experimental and mathematical modeling studies to investigate the mobility, dissolution, and aging of silver nanoparticles (nAg) in representative aquifer materials and ceramic filters. Results of one-dimensional column studies, conducted with water-saturated sands maintained at pH 4 or 7 and three levels of dissolved oxygen (DO), revealed that fraction of silver mass eluted as Ag+ increased with increasing DO level, and that the dissolution of attached nAg decreased over time as a result of surface oxidation. A hybrid Eulerain-Lagragian nanoparticle transport model, which incorporates DO-dependent dissolution kinetics and particle aging, was able to accurately simulate nAg mobility and Ag+ release measured in the column experiments. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that as the flow velocity and particle size decrease, nAg dissolution and Ag+ transport processes increasingly govern silver mobility. Consistent results were obtained in studies of ceramic water filters treated with nAg, where silver elution was shown to be governed by nAg dissolution to form Ag+ and subsequent cation exchange reactions. Recent studies explored the effects of surface coating aging on nAg aggregation, mobility and dissolution. Following ultraviolet light, nAg retention in water saturated sand increased by 25-50%, while up to 50% of the applied mass eluted as Ag+ compared to less than 1% for un-aged nAg.

            "abstract": "Sensor streams comprise an increasingly large part of Earth Science data. Analytics based on sensor data require an easy way to perform operations such as acquisition, conversion to physical units, metadata linking, sensor fusion, analysis and visualization on distributed sensor streams. Furthermore, embedding real-time sensor data into scientific workflows is of growing interest. We have implemented a scalable networked architecture that can be used to dynamically access packets of data in a stream from multiple sensors, and perform synthesis and analysis across a distributed network. Our system is based on the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (irods.org), which accesses sensor data from the Antelope Real Time Data System (brtt.com), and provides virtualized access to collections of data streams. We integrate real-time data streaming from different sources, collected for different purposes, on different time and spatial scales, and sensed by different methods. iRODS, noted for its policy-oriented data management, brings to sensor processing features and facilities such as single sign-on, third party access control lists ( ACLs), location transparency, logical resource naming, and server-side modeling capabilities while reducing the burden on sensor network operators. Rich integrated metadata support also makes it straightforward to discover data streams of interest and maintain data provenance. The workflow support in iRODS readily integrates sensor processing into any analytical pipeline. The system is developed as part of the NSF-funded Datanet Federation Consortium (datafed.org). APIs for selecting, opening, reaping and closing sensor streams are provided, along with other helper functions to associate metadata and convert sensor packets into NetCDF and JSON formats. Near real-time sensor data including seismic sensors, environmental sensors, LIDAR and video streams are available through this interface. A system for archiving sensor data and metadata in NetCDF format has been implemented and will be demonstrated at AGU.",

            "abstract": "Riparian vegetation has been recognized as a controlling factor of stream channel morphology, but specific influences on bed topography and planform geometry are yet to be fully clarified. In temperate environments, hardwood trees serve as prominent bank stabilizers and help create diverse habitats for a variety of aquatic organisms in alluvial channels. This project explores the influence of riparian vegetation on channel geometry in alluvial streams of different sizes. Exposed rootwads increase bank stability and slow channel migration rates, but also cause pool scour that affects thalweg and bedform locations downstream, implying that woody riparian vegetation influences flow conditions and two-dimensional bed geometry in alluvial streams. Field data suggest that the presence of hardwood vegetation modulates channel width, bed topography and planform geometry in low-order streams. In larger channels, rootwads have less influence on planform curvature, but create patchy variations in bed topography that establish thalweg locations and amplify relief of curvature-dominated bedforms. Flume experiments illustrate the genesis of rootwad-induced pool scour and its effect on downstream pool and bar formation. Experimental rootwad pools reflect the relative size and shape of those observed in natural channels. Introduction of riparian obstructions to planar beds also influences thalweg location several channel widths downstream, further supporting the idea of riparian influence on bedform modulation and regulation.",

            "abstract": "The recent annually averaged warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and of West Antarctica, stands in stark contrast to very small and weakly negative trends over East Antarctica. This asymmetry arises primarily from a highly significant warming of West Antarctica in austral spring and a strong cooling of East Antarctic in austral autumn. Here we examine whether this East-West asymmetry is a response to anthropogenic climate forcings or a manifestation of natural climate variability. We compare the observed Antarctic surface air temperature (SAT) trends from five temperature reconstructions over two distinct time periods (1979-2005 and 1960-2005), and with those simulated by 40 coupled models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the observed East-West asymmetry differs substantially over the two time periods and, furthermore, is completely absent from the CMIP5 multi-model mean (from which all natural variability is eliminated by the averaging). We compare the CMIP5 SAT trends to those of 29 historical atmosphere-only simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice and find that these simulations are in better agreement with the observations. This suggests that natural multi-decadal variability associated with SSTs and sea ice and not external forcings is the primary driver of Antarctic SAT trends. We confirm this by showing that the observed trends lie within the distribution of multi-decadal trends from the CMIP5 pre-industrial integrations. These results, therefore, offer new evidence which points to natural climate variability as the more likely cause of the recent warming of West Antarctica and of the Peninsula.",

This study presents a method for the spatial assessment of drought risk in southern China using a conceptual framework that emphasizes the combined role of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure.\nA drought hazard map was retrieved with a compound index of meteorological drought method in a GIS environment. Normally, a large variation in the disaster-inducing factor implies a high probability of economic/social losses caused by a drought disaster. The map indicated that areas with a higher risk of drought hazard were mainly distributed in mid-east Yunnan and the basins in eastern Sichuan.\nThe vulnerability indices were based on climate factors as well as land use, geomorphological types, soil properties, and drainage density. The water preserving capability of purple calcareous soil in the basins in Sichuan and mid-east Yunnan, and the lateritic red soil in northeastern Guangdong is relatively weak. The main geomorphological features in Guangxi and Guangdong are hills, which leads to a serious expectation of soil and water losses. Thus, the main areas with a high risk of drought vulnerability are mid-east Yunnan and the basins in eastern Sichuan.\nThe exposure indices were based on population density and agricultural production because population and agriculture experience the main impacts of a drought disaster. Higher exposure indices mean higher economic/social losses due to drought disasters. Areas with high exposure indices were mainly distributed in Guangdong and southern Guangxi.\nThe overall risk was then calculated as the product of the hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. The results indicated a higher risk of drought disaster in the basins in eastern Sichuan,, northeastern Yunnan, and northeastern Guangdong. The main factor influencing the risk of a drought disaster was the hazard, but the vulnerability and exposure also played important roles.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake impart a catastrophic forcing on hillslopes, that often lead to widespread landsliding and can contribute significantly to sedimentary and organic matter fluxes. We present a new expression for the total area and volume of populations of earthquake-induced landslides.This model builds on a set of scaling relationships between key parameters, such as landslide density, ground acceleration, fault size, earthquake source depth and seismic moment, derived from geomorphological and seismological observations. To assess the model we have assembled and normalized a catalogue of landslide inventories for 40 earthquakes. We have found that low landscape steepness systematically leads to over-prediction of the total area and volume of landslides.When this effect is accounted for, the model is able to predict within a factor of 2 the landslide areas and associated volumes for about two thirds of the cases in our databases. This is a significant improvement on a previously published empirical expression based only on earthquake moment.The prediction of total area is also sensitive to the landscape steepness, but less than the total volume.It seems also affected by the controls on the landslide frequency distribution that may include ground strength, soil continuity and extent or antecedent moisture. Some outliers in terms of observed landslide intensity are likely to be associated with exceptionally rock strength in the epicentral area, while others may be related to seismic source complexities ignored by the model.However, most cases in our catalogue seem to be relatively unaffected by these two effects despite the variety of lithologies and tectonic settings they cover.This makes our expression suitable for integration into landscape evolution models, and application to the assessment of secondary hazards and risks associated with earthquakes.",

The FLIP physical model underestimates the H+ densities by a factor of 2-3 between March 2006 and December 2010 for all seasons and low to moderate solar activity. The calculations indicate that the higher measured H+ densities are most likely due to higher neutral hydrogen densities. This could be the result of weaker than usual magnetic activity, which would reduce the energy input to high latitudes. Prolonged low magnetic activity periods could cause a global redistribution of hydrogen and also allow more neutral hydrogen to settle down from the exosphere into the mid latitude thermosphere. The finding of the need for higher H densities agrees well with recent exosphere measurements. The higher H densities can help explain the pronounced nighttime increases in NmF2 that are seen in winter through increased ion flow from the plasmasphere. Accurate H densities are also important for accurate modelling of plasmasphere refilling rates. Our calculations with the FLIP model show that the refilling rate is increased by a factor of 2 when the NRLMSISE H density is increased by a factor of 3 and no other changes made to the model inputs.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Mw 9.25 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake is the largest seismic event of the modern instrumental era. Despite considerable effort to analyze the characteristics of its rupture, the different available observations have proven difficult to simultaneously integrate jointly into a finite-fault slip model. In particular, the critical near-field geodetic records contain variable and significant post-seismic signal (between 2 weeks and 2 months) while the satellite altimetry records of the associated tsunami are affected by various sources of uncertainties (e.g. source rupture velocity, meso-scale oceanic currents). In this study, we investigate the quasi-static slip distribution of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake by carefully accounting for the different sources of uncertainties in the joint inversion of an extended set of geodetic and tsunami data. To do so, we use non-diagonal covariance matrices reflecting both data and model uncertainties in a fully Bayesian inversion framework. As model errors are particularly large for mega-earthquakes, we also rely on advanced simulation codes (normal mode theory on a layered spherical Earth for the static displacement field and non-hydrostatic equations for the tsunami) and account for the 3D curvature of the megathrust interface to reduce the associated epistemic uncertainties. The fully Bayesian inversion framework then enables us to derive the families of possible models compatible with the unevenly distributed and sometimes ambiguous measurements. We find two regions of high slip at latitudes 3°-4°N and 7°-8°N with amplitudes that probably reached values as large as 40 m and possibly larger. Such amounts of slip were not proposed by previous studies, which might have been biased by smoothing regularizations. We also find significant slip (around 20 m) offshore Andaman islands absent in earlier studies. Furthermore, we find that the rupture very likely involved shallow slip, with the possibility of reaching the trench.",

            "abstract": "In areas affected by snow, chloride (Cl) salts are widely used as a de-icing agent to improve road conditions. While the improvement in road safety is indisputable, there are environmental consequences to local aquatic ecosystems. In many waterways, Cl concentrations have been increasing since the early 1990s, often exceeding national water quality guidelines. To determine the quantity of Cl that is accumulating in urban and urbanizing watersheds, accurate estimates of road salt usage at the watershed-scale are needed. The complex jurisdictional control over road salt application in southern Ontario lends itself to a geospatial approach for calculating Cl inputs to improve the accuracy of watershed-scale Cl mass balance estimates. This study will develop a geospatial protocol for combining information on road salt applications and road network areas to refine watershed-scale Cl inputs, as well as assess spatiotemporal patterns in road salt application across the southern Ontario study region. The overall objective of this project is to use geospatial methods (predominantly ArcGIS) to develop high-accuracy estimates of road salt usage in urbanizing watersheds in southern Ontario. Specifically, the aims will be to map and summarize the types and areas (“lane-lengths”) of roadways in each watershed that have road salt applied to them, to determine the most appropriate source(s) of road salt usage data for each watershed, taking into consideration multiple levels of jurisdiction (e.g. municipal, regional, provincial), to calculate and summarize sub-watershed and watershed-scale road salt usage estimates for multiple years, and to analyze intra-watershed spatiotemporal patterns of road salt usage, especially focusing on impervious surfaces. These analyses will recommend areas of concern exacerbated by high-levels of road salt distribution; recommendations around modifying on-the-ground operations will be the next step in helping to correct these issues.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new standard for reporting Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) that is central to climate policy debates and decision-making. GWPs are an essential element of policy analysis and policymaking, and are even built into legal structures that regulate “carbon dioxide equivalents.” However, the current reporting convention is misleading because it hides the divergence between short and long-term interests inside a single timescale. We propose using two timescales everywhere, as an inseparable pair. This makes explicit one of the principal issues in climate policy: the temporal tradeoffs of benefits among actions that reduce emissions of a suite of climate pollutants.\nPolicymakers often treat GWPs as if they were a value-neutral technocratic measure, while in fact the choice of timescales, at the heart of the GWP, is central to the political battles over climate policy. At its most basic, cutting emissions of pollutants with different radiative properties and atmospheric lifetimes yields climate benefits that vary in the near- and long-term. Battles such as that between coal and natural gas rest on this distinction.\nThe most common form of GWP is based on a 100 year time integral, but this timescale conceals near-term impacts. On the other hand, opting instead for a 20 year time integral ignores climate impacts after 20 years. A distinguished list of scientists and economists has attempted to come up with improved metrics that incorporate the range of timescales into a single value. Our proposal abandons this quest. There is no “right” answer to the underlying dispute, but there is a right answer for policy analysis: use two time constants together, similar to the way that systolic and diastolic blood pressures, latitude and longitude, and city and highway gas mileage are reported together. This strategy will provide much needed clarification to myriad climate change solution-related decisions.",

            "abstract": "Characterising the distribution and magnitude of moisture content in the subsurface is important for a wide range of environments. In a glacial environment, porosity changes define the snow-firn, and firn-ice transitions, and the boundary between any cold (water-free) and temperate ice; these boundaries each have a large spatial variability. Crosshole radar (XHR) has been successfully applied in a wide range of near-surface investigations, allowing repeatable measurements of material volumes remaining under natural stresses. Porescale water quantities are inferred from bulk velocity variations caused by differences in electromagnetic properties between the water and the surrounding material. An increase in glacier porescale water from 0 to 0.8% will soften the ice and triple the strain rate. Hence, highly precise radar velocities are required, as ±0.003 m/ns is equivalent a water-content of ±0.4 volumetric %. We rigorously assess the sources of uncertainty in XHR surveys, their consequent effect on the measured water-content, and hence propose several revisions for improved data acquisition. We analyse two field data examples acquired with contemporary and improved techniques. We find contemporary data acquisition produces average velocity uncertainties of ±3.0% (±0.005 m/ns), equivalent to ±0.8 volumetric % water-content. Improved techniques reduce this uncertainty to ±1.5% (±0.003 m/ns), equivalent to ±0.4 volumetric % water-content. Measurement of the borehole diameter when hot-water drilling can further reduce this uncertainty to ±0.8% (±0.001 m/ns), or ±0.2 volumetric % water-content. The property differences between water, air and ice mean radar velocity variations are dominated by water changes. Although XHR provides a highly precise measurement, we find that accurate determination of water-content is not possible using this technique alone, without prior knowledge of the air-content; this could be quantified from a co-located, complementary borehole technique, e.g. Vertical Seismic Profile.",

The plasticity of (Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)O3 Bridgmanite, the main constituent of the lower mantle, is therefore crucial to understand the Earth's dynamics. Its deformation occurs at extreme pressure and temperature conditons (from 30 to 140 GPa, 2000 to 3000 K) and very low strain rate (from 10-12 to 10-16 s-1), the latter being impossible to reach experimentally.\nHere we calculate the strength of MgSiO3 perovskite (Mg-Pv), by modelling [100] and [010] dislocations at the atomic scale with molecular statics calculation. To assess the mobility of these dislocations under the conjugate action of stress and temperature, we describe their behaviour into a kink-pair model. We develop therefore a velocity model informed by atomistic calculations, taking into account P, T, stress and deformation strain-rate.\nWe show that our model is consistent with deformation experiments on perovskite (see figure), and can also be used to calculate the strength of Mg-Pv induced by dislocation creep at natural strain rate relevant to the mantle.",

            "abstract": "There are few direct observations of cross-stream isopycnal mixing in the interior of the Southern Ocean, yet such measurements are needed to determine the role of eddies transporting properties across the ACC, and key to progress toward testing theories of meridional overturning. In light of this we examine if it is possible to obtain estimates of mixing from Argo float trajectories. We divided the Southern Ocean into overlapping 15ο longitude bins before estimating mixing. Resulting diffusivities ranged from 300 to 3000 m2s-1, with peaks corresponding to the Scotia Sea; Kerguelen and Campbell Plateaus. Comparison of our diffusivities with previous regional studies demonstrated good agreement. Tests of the methodology in the DIMES region found that mixing from Argo floats agreed closely with mixing from RAFOS floats. To further test the method we used the Southern Ocean State Estimate velocity fields to advect particles with Argo and RAFOS float like behaviours. Stirring estimates from the particles agreed well with each other in the Kerguelen Island region, South Pacific and Scotia Sea, despite the differences in the imposed behaviour.\nFinally, these estimates were compared to mixing length suppression theory presented in Ferrari and Nikurashin 2010. This mixing length suppression theory quantifies horizontal diffusivity similar to Prandtl (1925), but the mixing length is suppressed in the presence of mean flows and eddy phase speeds. Our results suggest that the theory can explain both the structure and magnitude of mixing using mean flow data. An exception is near the Kerguelen and Campbell Plateaus where theory under-estimates mixing relative to our results.",

            "abstract": "The mesosphere/lower-thermosphere (MLT) is a highly variable atmospheric region driven by atmospheric waves. In particular, gravity waves play an important role for the mid-latitude MLT dynamics. Analyzing gravity wave parameters requires measurements e.g. of horizontal winds resolved in both space and time. Here we present a new concept to investigate the horizontal wind variability making use of the MMARIA (Multi-Station Multi-Frequency agile Radar for investigation of the Atmosphere). The network consists of two meteor radars at Juliusruh (54.6°N, 13.45°E) and Collm (51.3°N, 13°E) in Germany, as well as three forward scatter receive only stations at Kühlungsborn (54.1°N, 11.75°E) with dual frequency capability and Juliusruh (Germany). The combination of forward scatter meteor observations and monostatic radars permits to increase the temporal resolution of the MLT winds as well as to enhance the altitudinal coverage due to the increased Bragg wavelengths. We are going to present the preliminary results of this new approach and present our initial gravity waves analysis since summer 2015. The MMARIA network is suitable to study gravity waves and the horizontal wind variability for horizontal wavelength scales between 80-500 km and a temporal resolution between 15-60 minutes. These spatial and temporal scales are hardly accessible by any other remote sensing technique in so far this novel technique compliments existing observations of MLT winds.",

            "abstract": "Forbush decrease (FD) is an observed reduction in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity as measured by ground neutron monitors often associated energetic events on the Sun such as coronal mass ejections (CME). FD is associated with increased activity of the sun as reflected in the size of the interplanetary coronal mass ejections passing around the Earth and the corotating regions in the Heliosphere. Since the interplanetary anisotropy evolves itself during a geomagnetic storm in addition to the reconfiguration of external magnetospheric currents, it is expected that changes in transmissivity of cosmic rays of galactic origin will occur during Geomagnetic storms. In this study we examine sixty-three (63) FD events and associated geomagnetic storms over the last three solar cycles from 1970 to 2013. The negative peaks of the FDs and the Dst coincided for most of the events (~70%). There was good correlation (>0.67) between the FDs and Dst. Signatures of influence of external magnetospheric currents on the count rates of the neutron monitors stations during periods of Forbush decreases (FDs) is provided. This evidence is observed as sudden increases in the count rates during the main phase of simultaneous FD. The magnitude of the sudden rise in the count rates of Neutron monitors and peak dst correlated well (>0.50) both for high latitude and mid latitude stations.",

            "abstract": "Bursty (a few minutes) enhancements of hot electrons (1-10 keV) in the tail magnetosheath, which we name hot electron enhancements (HEEs), are sometimes observed. To understand the processes leading to HEEs, we have used 4 years of measurements from Acceleration Reconnection Turbulence & Electrodynamics of Moon’s Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) mission to statistically investigate the dawn-dusk asymmetry of HEEs in the mid-tail (X from –30 to –70 RE) magnetosheath and their correlations with the solar wind/interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. We find two strong dawn-dusk asymmetries associated with HEEs: (1) They occur about 3 to 4 times more frequently on the dawnside. (2) Their fluxes on the dawnside are about twice as large as those on the duskside. The magnitudes of HEE fluxes are similar to those of the magnetosphere fluxes near the magnetopause, which are also a factor of 2 higher on the dawnside, indicating that the magnetosphere electrons are likely the source for HEEs and the cause for the HEE flux asymmetry. HEEs occur preferentially during higher solar wind speed and the majority of HEEs are associated with sharp IMF direction changes and are accompanied by large and transient magnetosheath density changes. These correlations are stronger on the dawnside, suggesting that perturbations created near the quasi-parallel bow shock, which is most of the time on the dawnside, associated with IMF discontinuities is a possible process leading to HEEs and could account for the higher HEE occurrence on the dawnside.",

This model partitions the landscape into individual control volumes called hillslopes, which are determined from a 90 meter DEM. In addition to the results of this hydrological model, streamflow observations are available at more than 300 locations, including measurements from USGS operated streamflow gauges and Iowa Flood Center operated bridge sensors. Augmenting the model outputs with available observations can improve forecast accuracy. Combining these sources of information requires computing sensitivities of model states at each location to upstream states. These sensitivities greatly increase the number of computations and require additional computational power to maintain real-time usability.\nThis presentation documents developments with a real-time distributed streamflow forecasting model with assimilated data. The forecasting system applied to the State of Iowa (about 140,000 square kilometers) will be detailed. A comparison of streamflow forecasts with model states influenced by observations to forecasts without influence by observations is given to show the effectiveness of our methods.",

            "abstract": "The central Andes is a key global location to quantify storage, transport, and volumes of magma in the Earth’s crust as it is home to the world’s largest zone of partial melt (the Altiplano-Puna Magma or Mush Body, APMB) as well as the more recently documented Southern Puna Magma Body (SPMB). We describe results from the recently completed international PLUTONS project that focused inter-disciplinary study on two sites of large-scale surface uplift that presumably represent ongoing magmatic intrusions in the mid to upper crust – Uturuncu, Bolivia (in the center of the APMB) and Lazufre on the Chile-Argentina border (on the edge of the SPMB). In particular, a suite of geophysical techniques (seismology, gravity, surface deformation, and electro-magnetic methods) have been used to infer the current subsurface distribution and quantity of partial melts in combination with geochemical and lab studies on samples from the area. Both Uturuncu and Lazufre show separate geophysical anomalies in the upper and mid/lower crust (e.g., low seismic velocity, low resistivity, etc.) indicating multiple distinct reservoirs of magma and/or hydrothermal fluids with different properties. The characteristics of the geophysical anomalies differ somewhat depending on the technique used – reflecting the different sensitivity of each method to subsurface melt of different compositions, connectivity, and volatile content. For example, the depth to the top of the APMB is shallower in a joint ambient noise tomography and receiver function analysis compared to a 3D magnetotelluric inversion. One possibility is that the seismic methods are detecting brines above the APMB that do not have a large electromagnetic signature. Comparison of the geophysical measurements with laboratory experiments at the APMB indicate a minimum of 4-25% melt averaged over the region is needed -- higher melt volumes are permitted by the gravity and MT data and may exist in small regions. However, bulk melt values above 40-50% are considered unlikely as they would not be physically stable.",

Here we will address the variability of growing conditions for wheat in Algeria with climatic data and a tree-ring reconstruction of January-June precipitation from ten Pinus halepensis tree-ring chronologies. A regression-based reconstruction equation explains up to 74% of the variance of precipitation in the 1970-2011 calibration period and cross validates well. Classification of dry years by the 30% percentile of observed precipitation (131 mm) yields a maximum length of drought of five years (1877-1881) and increasing frequency of dry years in the late 20th and early 21stcenturies. A correlation-based sensitivity analysis shows a similar pattern of dependence of tree-growth and wheat production on monthly and seasonal precipitation, but contrasting patterns of dependence on temperature. The patterns are interpreted by reference to phenology, growth phases, and – for wheat agricultural practices.

            "abstract": "Methods to derive paleodirections or paleointensities from rocks currently rely on measurements of bulk samples (typically ~10 cc). The process of recording and storing magnetizations as function of temperature, however, differs for grains of various sizes and chemical compositions. Most rocks, by their mere nature, consist of assemblages of grains varying in size, shape, and chemistry. When dealing with lavas, this differing magnetic behavior often hampers paleointensity experiments; while occasionally a reliable paleodirection is obscured (e.g. Coe et al. (2014)). If we would be able to isolate the contribution of each magnetic grain in a sample to the bulk magnetic moment of that sample, a wealth of opportunities for highly detailed magnetic analysis would be opened, possibly leading to an entirely new approach in retrieving paleomagnetic signals from complex mineralogies. Here we take the first practical steps towards this goal by developing a new technique: ‘micromagnetic tomography’.\nFirstly, the distribution and volume of the remanence carrying grains in the sample must be assessed; this is done using a MicroCT scanner capable of detecting grains >1 micron. Secondly, the magnetic stray field perpendicular to the surface of a thin sample is measured using a high-resolution DC SQUID microscope. A mathematical inversion of these measurements yields the isolated direction and magnitude of the magnetic moment of individual grains in the sample. As the measured strength of the magnetic field decreases with the third power as function of distance to the exerting grain (as a result of decay in three dimensions), grains in the top 10-20 microns of the sample can be assessed reliably.",

Geochemical similarity of Kuznets basalts with those from Norilsk region supports this interpretation.

The result indicates a penetration depth of 2.2 nm. Our data suggest that the OH concentration profile in squalane as a function of the distance from the squalane/air interface can be satisfactorily described by the analytical solution to diffusion equation with an added chemical loss term experienced by the OH radical. This allowed an almost unambiguous determination of either OH diffusivity or OH reactivity given that one of the value is known in systems where radical chain propagation is not a significant factor and can shed new lights on the lifetime alteration of particulate matters in the atmosphere where possible coating processes are abundant.",

            "abstract": "Modeling signal and noise in geodetic time series is crucial for the proper interpretation of the data. Depending on how the functional and stochastic models are defined, the estimated trend and corresponding uncertainties can vary significantly, emphasizing the need for a robust tool for their estimation. In this study, instead of using the traditional deterministic approach where seasonal signals are estimated with fixed amplitudes and phases and the trend is assumed to be linear, an alternate approach is presented in which these signals are modeled stochastically. The benefit of this approach is that it allows for physically natural variations of the various signal constituents over time. To accomplish this, state space models are defined and solved through the use of a Kalman filter. Since the appropriate choice of the noise parameters is at the heart of the proposed approach, a robust method for their estimation is developed. The performance of the methodology is demonstrated using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) data at the CAS1 station located in East Antarctica and compared to commonly used least-squares adjustment techniques. The results show that the developed technique allows for a more reliable trend estimation as well as for more physically valuable interpretations while validating independent geodetic observing systems. Moreover, the results suggest that the pursued methodology should become the standard in particular when analyzing climatologic data.",

            "abstract": "Physics-based models of volcanic eruptions have grown more sophisticated over the past few decades. These models, combined with Bayesian inversion, offer the potential of integrating diverse geological and geophysical datasets to better understand volcanic systems. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with a physics-based conduit model, we invert data from the 2004-2008 dome-forming eruption at Mount St. Helens, USA. We extend the 1D cylindrical conduit model of Anderson and Segall [2011] to include vertical and lateral gas loss from the magma, as well as equilibrium crystallization. The melt viscosity increases strongly with crystal content. Magma permeability obeys the Kozeny-Carman law with a threshold porosity. Excess pressure in the magma chamber drives Newtonian flow of magma upwards until the viscous resistance to flow exceeds the rate-dependent frictional strength on the conduit wall, at which point the magma transitions from viscous flow to plug flow.\nWe investigate the steady-state solutions for lava dome growth between March and December 2005, in which magma chamber pressure, initial water content, permeability and friction parameters are unknown model parameters. These parameters are constrained by: dome rock porosity, extrusion rate from photogrammetry, plug depth from drumbeat earthquakes, and crystallization pressure from petrologic studies. Posterior probability density functions (PDFs) reveal the constraints on the model parameters and their correlations. Assuming lithostatic normal stress on the plug, low coefficients of friction (0.1-0.3) are required to allow extrusion at the observed rate while maintaining reasonable magma chamber pressures. Lower effective normal stress or melt viscosity could allow for larger friction coefficients. Future work will investigate the time-dependent system, thereby allowing us to incorporate time-evolving geodetic and eruption rate data into the inversion.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the most important greenhouse gases. Soils are the dominant natural source of N2O, and have been shown to be a small sink under N-limited conditions. Wetlands are a significant natural source of CH4, and dry upland soils a natural CH4 sink. Soils release CO2 produced by both autotrophic (root) and heterotrophic (microbial) respiration processes. Variation in soil moisture can be very dynamic, and it is one of the dominant factors controlling soil aeration, and hence the balance between aerobic (predominantly CO2 producing) and anaerobic (both CO2 and CH4 producing) respiration. The production and consumption of N2O is also highly dependent on spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture. Howland forest, ME is a mosaic of well drained upland, wetland and small transitional upland/wetland soils which makes for a unique and challenging environment to measure the effects of soil moisture on the net exchange of these important greenhouse gases.\nTo quantify the flux of CO2, CH4 and N2O from the Howland forest soils, we utilized a previously developed automated chamber system for measuring CO2 efflux (Licor 6252 IRGA) from soils, and configured it to run in-line with a new model quantum cascade laser (QCL) system which measures N2O and CH4 (Aerodyne model QC-TILDAS-CS). This system allowed for simultaneous, high frequency, continuous measurement of all three greenhouse gases. Fourteen sampling chambers were deployed in an upland soil (8), nearby wetland (3) and a transitional upland/wetland (3). Each chamber was measured every 90 minutes. Upland soils were consistent sources of CO2 and sinks for CH4, however the N2O fluxes were transient between sources and sinks. The wetland soils were consistent sources of high CH4 emissions, low CO2 emissions and a consistently small N2O sink. The transitional upland/wetland soil was a consistent source of CO2 but was much more transient between CH4 and N2O sources and sinks. High frequency CO2, CH4 and N2O flux measurements were used to estimate seasonal flux sums, and the flux estimates from each soil drainage class were then applied to a GIS-based soil map to create a spatially representative estimate of net flux at the landscape scale.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 41% of Earth´s terrestrial surface consists of drylands and they are an important biome on all continents. Although dryland biota would be expected to be drought adapted, they can be surprisingly vulnerable to extended dry periods with subsequent consequences for biogeochemical cycles. Biological soil crusts, constituting up to 70% of the living cover in these regions, are important in these cycles. They fix both N and C, providing a significant percentage of regional and global inputs. However, extended drought reduces both types of inputs, as biocrusts are only metabolically active when wet, yet losses continue even when soils are dry. In addition, extended droughts can result in their mortality. The amount of net soil C exchange of biocrusted soils is controversial, but in SE Utah, soil C uptake only occurred when only when soils were wet. As soils are infrequently wet, annual balances were negative during the 2 year study and with future extended droughts or increased temperatures that reduce soil moisture, these losses will become even greater. As with C, N fixation also requires biocrusts be wet and thus inputs decline with extended drought or higher temperatures that both reduce input and result in lichen and cyanobacterial mortality. And similarly, N losses continue even when soils are dry. Loss of biocrust mosses can profoundly alter N cycles. Desert plants are also affected by drought: in plots where experimental drought was imposed, plants had lower photosynthetic rates and higher leaf C:N, which will likely affect productivity and decomposition rates and thus have further impacts on soil biogeochemical cycles.",

            "abstract": "Dry and subhumid lands cover ~41% of Earth’s terrestrial surface and biocrusts are often a dominant lifeform in these regions. These soil surface communities are known to be critical component in determining dryland hydrologic cycles by altering infiltration, runoff and evaporation processes; thus, they create a hotspot for ecohydrologic processes. Biocrust properties, such as micro-topography and the spatial distribution of overall cover and individual species, are believed to be the most influential; these properties vary with climate. Across the gradient from higher potential evapo-transpiration (PET; lower rainfall/higher temperatures such as hyper-arid deserts) to lower PET (higher rainfall/lower temperature such as semi-arid steppe), the external morphology of biocrusts generally goes from very smooth to highly roughened, with water residence time thus increasing as well. This change in PET is also accompanied by increasing species number and biomass; while these changes increase water absorption, they also clogs soil pores. It has long been believed that as biocrust roughness, species, and biomass increases, so does water infiltration and retention. However, the majority of these studies have occurred at a very small (< 2m2) spatial scale. Interesting, when done at the small scale, the current dogma holds: smooth biocrusts with low biomass decrease infiltration and increase runoff, whereas roughened ones with higher biomass increase infiltration. However, studies done at larger spatial scales across a gradient of roughness, species composition, and biomass, show biocrusts almost always increase infiltration and decrease runoff, regardless of biocrust characteristics. This finding runs counter to long-held views regarding the role of biocrusts in hydrologic cycles. These findings have large implications for modelling of soil moisture cycles in drylands under current and future conditions and the concept of ecohydrologic hotspots and hot moments in drylands.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed the effects of slopes on the thermal properties of three dune fields in Mars’ southern hemisphere. Although slope has important thermal effects, it is not the main driver of observed apparent thermal inertia (ATI) for these dunes. Comparing the ATI seasonal behavior as derived from Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) data with that modeled for compositional heterogeneities, we found that TES results correlate best with models of duricrust overlying and/or horizontally mixing with fines. We measured slopes and aspects in digital terrain models created from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images of dunes within Proctor, Kaiser, and Wirtz craters. Using the MARSTHERM web toolset, we incorporated the slopes and aspects together with TES albedo, TES thermal inertia, surface pressure, and TES dust opacity, into models of seasonal ATI. Models that incorporate sub-pixel slopes show seasonal day and night ATI values that differ from the TES results by 0-300 J m-2 K-1 s-½. In addition, the models' day-night differences are opposite in sign from those of the TES results, indicating that factors other than slope are involved. We therefore compared the TES data to model results for a broad range of horizontally mixed and two-layered surfaces to seek other possible controls on the observed data, finding that a surface layer of higher thermal inertia is a likely contributor. However, it is clear from this study that the overall composition and morphology of the dune fields are more complex than currently available models allow. Future work will combine slopes with other model parameters such as multi-layered surfaces and lateral changes in layer thickness. Coupling these improvements with broader seasonal coverage from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) at more thermally favorable times of day would allow more accurate characterization of dune thermal behavior.",

            "abstract": "In inundation zones, tsunami motion turns from wave motion to flow of water. Modelling of this phenomenon is a complex problem since there are many parameters affecting the tsunami flow. In this respect, the performance of numerical codes that analyze tsunami inundation patterns becomes important. The computation of water surface elevation is not sufficient for proper analysis of tsunami behaviour in shallow water zones and on land and hence for the development of mitigation strategies. Velocity and velocity patterns are also crucial parameters and have to be computed at the highest accuracy. There are numerous numerical codes to be used for simulating tsunami inundation. In this study, FLOW 3D and NAMI DANCE codes are selected for validation and performance comparison. Flow 3D simulates linear and nonlinear propagating surface waves as well as long waves by solving three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (3D-NS) equations. FLOW 3D is used specificaly for flood problems. NAMI DANCE uses finite difference computational method to solve linear and nonlinear forms of shallow water equations (NSWE) in long wave problems, specifically tsunamis. In this study, these codes are validated and their performances are compared using two benchmark problems which are discussed in 2015 National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) Annual meeting in Portland, USA. One of the problems is an experiment of a single long-period wave propagating up a piecewise linear slope and onto a small-scale model of the town of Seaside, Oregon. Other benchmark problem is an experiment of a single solitary wave propagating up a triangular shaped shelf with an island feature located at the offshore point of the shelf. The computed water surface elevation and velocity data are compared with the measured data. The comparisons showed that both codes are in fairly good agreement with each other and benchmark data. All results are presented with discussions and comparisons.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe)",

The modulations of the GCR during quiet and disturbed interplanetary conditions have been investigated with a view to better understand the role of the global merged interaction regions and coronal mass ejections to the GCR modulation. From first-order partial correlation, we found that removing the influence of the total IMF-B, (especially during quiet conditions), and the influence of SW dynamic pressure (during disturbed conditions) generally enhances the correlation of the residual geomagnetic field with the GCR significantly. The influence of the more subtle parameters like speed, Bz component and proton density were masked by these dominant parameters.

These investigations have tended to look at the major solar wind species (protons, alphas, electrons) separately, and how the distribution of the parameters of each species is separately constrained by the kinetic instability arising from free energy in its own distribution. However, the stability of the plasma depends on all species together, and here we present a first investigation of this using a combined proton/alpha/electron data set from the 3DP and SWE instruments on the Wind spacecraft. When all species are combined, the distributions appear to be remarkably well constrained by the fluid firehose and mirror thresholds. Non-proton species and drifts make significant contributions to the plasma being marginally firehose unstable. Theoretical implications of these results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The WINTER aircraft campaign was a recent field experiment to probe the sources and evolution of gas pollutants and aerosols in Northeast US urban and industrial plumes during the winter. A highly customized Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) was flown on the NCAR C-130 to characterize submicron aerosol composition and evolution. Thirteen research flights were conducted covering a wide range of conditions, including rural, urban, and marine environments during day and night. Organic aerosol (OA) was a large component of the submicron aerosol in the boundary layer. The fraction of OA (fOA) was smaller (35-40%) than in recent US summer campaigns (~60-70%). Biomass burning was observed to be an important source of OA in the boundary layer, which is consistent with recent wintertime studies that show a substantial contribution of residential wood burning to the OA loadings. OA oxygenation (O/C ratio) shows a broad distribution with a substantial fraction of smaller O/C ratios when compared to previous summertime campaigns. Since measurements were rarely made very close to primary sources (i.e. directly above urban areas), this is consistent with oxidative chemistry being slower during winter. SOA formation and aging in the NYC plume was observed during several flights and compared with summertime results from LA (CalNex) and Mexico City (MILAGRO). Additionally, an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) capable of oxidizing ambient air up to several equivalent days of oxidation was deployed for the first time in an aircraft platform. The aerosol outflow of the OFR was sampled with the AMS to provide real-time snapshots of the potential for aerosol formation and aging. For example, a case study of a flight through the Ohio River valley showed evidence of oxidation of SO2 to sulfate. The measured sulfate enhancements were in good agreement with our OFR chemical model. OFR results for SOA will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The mantle of the Earth contains Pt-group elements along with S, Se, and Te is roughly chondritic relative ratios, but with absolute concentrations of less than 1% chondrite. This property is expected for a mechanical mixture into the mantle which was previous depleted in Pt-group elemnts, but not for equilibrium partition between silicate and molten iron. The well-known late-veneer hypothesis states that this material arrived after the moon-forming impact within bodies with a total mass of 0.3-0.7% of the Earth’s mantle. The ratio of the mass of the lunar veneer component to the Moon’s mass is much less. For this situation to occur, most of the mass of the impactors was concentrated in the few largest bodies that crashed into the large Earth, rather than the small Moon. Several of these bodies were large enough to sterile the Earth by boiling the oceans. Alternatively, much of the terrestrial veneer came from the core of the moon-forming impactor Theia, rather than from later bodies. Recent lunar studies show that the Moon likely contains \"excess\" iron spewed from Theia’s core. The mass of the lunar core is ~1.6×1021 kg. There is also an excess FeO component in the lunar mantle of 1.3-3.5x1021 kg as Fe. The total excess (core + mantle) lunar Fe is 3-5x1021 kg or ~2% of Theia’s core. This mass is comparable to the excess Fe of 2.3-10x1021 kg in the Earth’s mantle inferred from the Pt-group veneer and chondritic Fe/Pt. Most likely Fe metal from Theia’s core entered the Moon-forming disk. Part of the Fe was oxidized by H2O and Fe2O3 in the disk, leaving the lunar mantle near the Fe-FeO buffer. The remaining iron metal condensed, gathered lunar Pt-group elements from the disk, and became the lunar core. The lunar crust and mantle are hence strongly depleted in Pt-group elements, implying a thin late veneer. In contrast, the Earth’s mantle contained excess oxidants. The admixed Fe from Theia’s core was nearly quantitatively oxidized. H2O and Fe2O3 components remained in the mantle with the Pt-group veneer. Solar system wide planetary accretion and late impact scenarios should not be calibrated to provide a thick veneer component to the Earth. For biology, it is conceivable that few or no ocean-boiling impacts frustrated life on the Earth. A nearly sterilzing impact may have left thermophile bottlenecks that root major clades of life.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands have large uncertainties. They are often small in magnitude and originate from landscapes with highly heterogeneous land cover patterns posing challenges to determining their green-house gas (GHG) budget. We combined two CH4 flux measurement approaches to overcome these issues and find the overall GHG budget of a small, heterogeneous, urban wetland park. Intermittent point measurements of fluxes from chambers provided information about the heterogeneity of fluxes, while eddy-covariance flux measurements provided information about the temporal dynamics of the fluxes. Both were combined to a scaled ‘fixed frame’ time series, correcting for temporal variability in the spatial coverage of the tower footprint.\nThe macrophyte-vegetated (VEG) and open-water (OW) areas followed similar cycles and emitted similar levels of CH4 throughout the year. VEG exhibited a stronger late-summer emission peak than did OW, possibly due to CH4 transport through mature vegetation. Normalizing the tower data to a fixed frame allowed us to determine the overall CH4 budget of each patch type. OW was the strongest in terms of emissions per unit area, but the larger VEG area contributed the greatest total CH4 emission. Using a scaling approach for carbon (CO2) uptake we calculated the net total GHG contribution of this urban wetland park. Because chambers are not feasible over large vegetation or over extended time periods, the net CO2 budget over the same fixed-frame was approximated over a range and cannot be accurately measured directly over all the components of the park landscape. Overall the newly constructed wetland park acted as a sink for GHG over the last 3 years.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions are associated with complex, time-dependent gas emissions and ground deformation. Observations of such signals are a primary gauge of eruption mechanisms, progress and cessation and as such, are critical for hazard assessment. It is often the case that gas emissions and deformation continue for months to years after the end of an eruption. Interpretation of such signals are critical for making decisions about whether an eruption may be considered over or not, yet very little is understood about the processes behind them and how they are coupled. However, the link between the deformation measured and the gases emitted during and after eruptions is fundamental. It has long been recognised that the presence of exsolved fluids enhances magma compressibility, leading to smaller-than-expected syn-eruptive volume changes observed at the surface (by InSAR or by GPS networks). The fluid phase present in the magma prior to eruption contains an assemblage of volatile species, most of which we are able to measure at the surface. Our improved understanding of volatile saturation in silicate melts and the availability of thermodynamic models to predict the partitioning of sulfur between fluid and melt means that coupled interpretations of gas emissions and deformation are now possible, given independent estimates of erupted volumes and other intrinsic parameters such as pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity. We illustrate, using a well constrained example of a prolonged, multi-episode eruption, the utility in developing coupled models to describe volume changes and outgassing processes with a view to enhancing our ability to interpret these critical monitoring data streams.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the recurrence intervals of repeating earthquakes offshore northern Japan in the period 1996 to 2011 imply long-term acceleration of aseismic slip preceding the 2011 M9 Tohoku-oki earthquake, confirming a previous inference from completely independent GPS data (Mavrommatis et al., 2014, GRL). We test whether sequences of repeating earthquakes exhibit a statistically significant monotonic trend in recurrence interval by applying the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. Offshore northern Tohoku, all sequences that pass the test exhibit decelerating recurrence, consistent with decaying afterslip following the 1994 M7.7 Sanriku earthquake. On the other hand, offshore south-central Tohoku, all sequences that pass the test exhibit accelerating recurrence, consistent with long-term accelerating creep prior to the 2011 Μ9 earthquake.\nUsing a physical model of repeating earthquake recurrence, we produce time histories of cumulative slip on the plate interface. After correcting for afterslip following several M~7 earthquakes in the period 2003-2011, we find that all but one sequence exhibit statistically significant slip accelerations. Offshore south-central Tohoku, the estimated slip acceleration is on average 2.9 mm/yr2, consistent with the range of 2.6–4.0 mm/yr2 estimated from independent GPS data (Mavrommatis et al., 2014).\nFrom a joint inversion of GPS and seismicity data, we infer that a substantial portion of the plate interface experienced accelerating creep in the 15 years prior to the M9 Tohoku-oki earthquake. The large slip area of the Tohoku-oki earthquake appears to be partly bounded by accelerating creep, implying that most of the rupture area of the M9 earthquake was either locked or creeping at a constant rate during this time period. Accelerating creep would result in increasing stressing rate on locked parts of the interface, thereby promoting nucleation of moderate to large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Anomalies in the slowness of teleseisms have been observed in numerous studies, with previous efforts focusing on crust and upper mantle sources for their origin. Little attention has been devoted to the global distribution of P- and S-wave slowness anomalies in the deep Earth. In this study, we use large aperture seismic array data to examine slowness anomalies as a function of depth in the lower mantle. We collected seismic recordings from all broadband seismic stations in North America for earthquakes between January 2004 and June 2015 with moment magnitudes between 5.8 and 7.5, event depths greater than 100 km, and epicentral distances from 40° to 90°. We chose the time range to coincide with the Earthscope seismic experiment. The epicentral distance range used in this study ensured the target phases, direct P and S wave arrivals, turned in the mantle at depths ranging from 1000 to 2800 km. The original data set contained 420 events with 171,696 seismograms. We inspected each seismogram manually and discarded traces without clear P or S arrivals. Our final data set consists of 278 events with 129,748 seismograms. For each event, we grouped the data into 3° radius geographic bins and calculated relative time shifts for each bin using the Automated and Interactive Measurement of Body-wave Arrival Times (AIMBAT) technique. AIMBAT is a python tool for measuring teleseismic arrival times based on the multi-channel cross-correlation (MCCC) method. For each bin, we plotted the relative time shifts as a function of epicentral distances and calculated the corresponding least-square regression line. The slowness (dT/dΔ) can be obtained as the slope of the regression line. The slowness values of all geographic bins were collected to build a slowness profile for each event. In order to identify slowness anomalies, these slowness profiles were compared with synthetic slowness profiles calculated using the 2.5-D axi-symmetric finite-difference methods PSVaxi for P waves and SHaxi for S waves. Seismic tomography models LLNL-G3Dv3 for P-waves and S40RTS for S-waves were used as the baseline for synthetic modeling in order to eliminate any anomaly caused by known structures. We present a global distribution of mantle P- and S-wave slowness anomalies as a function of depth in the mantle and explore their possible origins.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, it is broadly accepted that the Central Andes resulted largely from crustal shortening in the last ~45 Ma, driven by horizontal forces as a consequence of subduction of the Nazca plate beneath South America. However, the way this shortening is achieved is still a matter a debate. Structural, seismological, thermochronological, isotopical and sedimentological studies of the Central Andes, together with thermomechanical modeling, suggest that different megadetachments located shallow in the upper crust were active during the construction of the Andes. Constrains on changes in the state of stress in the crust gleaned from more than 1,500 fault-slip data in the arc region provide insights into how and when these megadetachments get activated or deactivated. We used a forward modeling procedure to examine five transects across the Central Andes, at 21.5°, 24°, 30°, 34° and 35°S, with particular emphasis on the relationship between deep and shallow structures. Our kinematic-thermomechanical models show that most of the upper-middle crust has a brittle-elastic behavior particularly for the cold and rigid forearc and foreland regions, and a ductile behavior below the thermally weakened arc region. Our models assume a shallow, sub-horizontal megadetachment located at the shallowest brittle-ductile transition, which concentrates the majority of the horizontal crustal shortening between the fore-arc and the South American craton. During this horizontal shortening, the crust gets thick and topography rises due to buoyancy of the crustal root. The threshold of this thickening is achieved when the bouyancy force equals the horizontal force. At this point, the megadetachment deactives and the crustal root widens eastwards in concert with ductile deformation in the lower crust and the generation of a new megadetachment. By studying changes in the paleostress fields along the arc region, from compression to strike-slip, and strike-slip to extension, associated with σ3/σ2 and σ2/σ1 permutations respectively, together with the timing of uplift and exhumation of the morphostructural units across the transects, we can constrain the timing of activation/deactivation of the detachments responsible for the Andean deformation.

Recent archeological studies on Valdivia (3500 BC) and Manteña (800-1500 AC - Harris et al. 2004) civilizations remains link this deposits with the intense eruptive phases that afflicted Ecuador 700-900 years ago (Usselman, 2006). Stratigraphic evidences and bibliographic datations of paleosols (Estrada, 1962; Mothes and Hall, 2008), allowed to estimate that these deposits are linked with the 800 BP eruption of Quilotoa and the following eruptions of Cotopaxi. According to the Smith and Lowe classification (1991), the deposits outcropping on the coast (located at a distance greater than 160 km from the volcanic vents), varied from whitish to grey, loose to weakly consolidated, massive to weakly stratified, centimeters to meters thick, coarse to fine ash matrix layers (diluite streamflow facies) to massive, large angular to sub-rounded siltitic blocks-rich and coarse to medium ash matrix deposits (debris flow facies). These types of lithofacies are associated to a rain-triggered lahar (De Belizal et al., 2013). The presence in some stratigraphic sections of sharp contacts, laminated layers of very fine ash, and also cm-thick sand and silt layers between the ash beds of the same deposits permit to understand that the different pulses were generated in short periods and after a long period. Structures like water pipes imply that the lahar went into the sea (Schneider, 2004), and allow the reconstruction of the paleotopographic condition during the emplacement of these deposits. This study focuses on the characterization of these types of deposits, permit to understand the kind of risk that may affect the towns located on the coast of Ecuador after VEI 4 to 6 eruptions on short time and within years.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation is highly variable in space and time. It has traditionally been measured with rain-gauges at point locations and the records are overwhelmingly daily.\nThe target of this paper is disaggregation of daily data into hourly estimates using pluviometers which are likely to be in the minority of rain gauges in a chosen region.\nThe methodology is based on the observation that the wet hourly intervals in a subregion containing a few control pluviometers tend to match each other rather well. Furthermore, the amount of precipitation in each hour of the day at each control match quite closely, as far as ordering is concerned. These properties form the basis of the disggregation procedure. To briefly outline the new method, we disaggregate the daily totals to hourly using the distribution of rainfall amounts in each of the 24 hours, conditioned on\n(i) the day's total precipitation catch at the target and\n(ii) the statistical link between the hourly catch at each pluviometer in the control set over the 24 hours. The technique employed is a form of constrained simulation based on Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC).\nThe method is using Gaussian copula based constrained simulation, and offers a very flexible combination of the different sources of information. As simulation methodology it can be directly used for uncertainty assessment. Using the statistical links between the transformed control and target hourly values, we simulate an arbitrary number of sets of transformed target hourly values, which yield desired statistics like expectations and selected quantiles.\nThe methodology is applied to a set of 75 stations with hourly data and 760 daily observations collected over 16 years in South-Germany (Bavaria). A cross validation was performed for all days exceeding 1 mm precipitation stations of the hourly precipitation network. The performance of the disaggregation was compared to other methods - Rescaled Nearest Neighbours and Rescaled Ordinary Kriging. The model shows good performance in the sense of expected values, and reproduces the distribution of wet amounts well. As a next step the daily amounts were disaggregated for subsequent use for hydrological modelling.\nThe procedure can be extended relatively simply to obtain daily values from monthly totals.",

            "abstract": "Latent Heat (LE) and Sensible Heat (H) flux are two major components of the energy balance at the earth’s surface which play important roles in the water cycle and global warming. There are various methods for their estimation or measurement. Eddy covariance is a direct and accurate technique for their measurement. Some limitations lead to prevention of the extensive use of the eddy covariance technique. Therefore, simulation approaches can be utilized for their estimation. ANNs are the information processing systems, which can inspect the empirical data and investigate the relations (hidden rules) among them, and then make the network structure.\nIn this study, multi-layer perceptron neural network trained by the steepest descent Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm was tested to simulate LE and H flux above two maize sites (rain-fed & irrigated) near Mead, Nebraska.\nNetwork training and testing was fulfilled using hourly data of including year, local time of day (DTime), leaf area index (LAI), soil water content (SWC) in 10 and 25 cm depths, soil temperature (Ts) in 10 cm depth, air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (WS), irrigation and precipitation (P), net radiation (Rn), and the fraction of incoming Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) absorbed by the canopy (fPAR), which were selected from days of year (DOY) 169 to 222 for 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009.\nThe results showed high correlation between actual and estimated data; the R² values for LE flux in irrigated and rain-fed sites were 0.9576, and 0.9642; and for H flux 0.8001, and 0.8478, respectively. Furthermore, the RMSE values ranged from 0.0580 to 0.0721 W/m² for LE flux and from 0.0824 to 0.0863 W/m² for H flux. In addition, the sensitivity of the fluxes with respect to each input was analyzed over the growth stages. Thus, the most powerful effects among the inputs for LE flux were identified net radiation, leaf area index, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, and for H flux net radiation, wind speed, air temperature, leaf area index and vapor pressure deficit. This study reveals that artificial neural networks are not only a powerful technique for estimation of LE and H fluxes, but also can identify the effectiveness of each input on the fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Models using repeat LiDAR and field campaigns may be one mechanism to monitor carbon storage and flux in forested regions. Considering the ability of multi-temporal LiDAR to estimate growth, it is not surprising that there is great interest in developing forest carbon monitoring strategies that rely on repeated LiDAR acquisitions. Allowing for sparser field campaigns, LiDAR stands to make monitoring forest carbon cheaper and more efficient than field-only sampling procedures. Here, we look to the spatio-temporally data-rich Kenai Peninsula in Alaska to examine the potential for Bayesian spatio-temporal mapping of forest carbon storage and uncertainty. The framework explored here can predict forest carbon through space and time, while formally propagating uncertainty through to prediction. Bayesian spatio-temporal models are flexible frameworks allowing for forest growth processes to be formally integrated into the model. By incorporating a mechanism for growth---using temporally repeated field and LiDAR data---we can more fully exploit the information-rich inventory network to improve prediction accuracy. LiDAR data for the Kenai Peninsula has been collected on four different occasions---spatially coincident LiDAR strip samples in 2004, 09 and 14, along with a wall-to-wall collection in 2008. There were 436 plots measured twice between 2002 and 2014. LiDAR was acquired at least once over most inventory plots with many having LiDAR collected during 2, 3 or 4 different campaigns. Results from this research will impact how forests are inventoried. It is too expensive to monitor terrestrial carbon using field-only sampling strategies and currently proposed LiDAR model-based techniques lack the ability to properly utilize temporally repeated and misaligned data. Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models offer a solution to these shortcomings and allow for formal predictive error assessment, which is useful for policy development and decision making.",

            "abstract": "A recent airborne field experiment in the remote tropical western Pacific, CONTRAST (CONvective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics), obtained over 80 vertical profiles of water vapor, ozone and numerous trace species from the surface to above 14 km during January-February 2014. These observations showed the frequent occurrence of extreme dry layers (relative humidity < 20%) co-located with enhanced ozone, occurring primarily over altitudes ~4-10 km. We compare these water vapor measurements with analyses from the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS), and find good overall agreement. We then use the GFS analyses to quantify the climatological variability of extreme dry layers in the tropical troposphere, finding frequent occurrence in the subtropics of both hemispheres during winter-spring. The space-time structure of the dry layers, in addition to the strong anti-correlation between water vapor and ozone, suggests frequent transport to the tropics from the extratropical upper troposphere – lower stratosphere (UTLS).",

            "abstract": "The ElarmS earthquake early warning algorithm has been detecting earthquakes throughout California since 2007. It is one of the algorithms that contributes to CISN’s ShakeAlert, a prototype earthquake early warning system being developed for California.\nOverall, ElarmS performance has been excellent. Over the past year (July 1, 2014 – July 1, 2015), ElarmS successfully detected all but three of the significant earthquakes (M4+) that occurred within California. Of the 24 events that were detected, the most notable was the M6.0 South Napa earthquake that occurred on August 24, 2014. The first alert for this event was sent in 5.1 seconds with an initial magnitude estimate of M5.7. This alert provided approximately 8 seconds of warning of the impending S-wave arrival to the city of San Francisco. The magnitude estimate increased to the final value of M6.0 within 15 seconds of the initial alert. One of the two events that were not detected by ElarmS occurred within 30 seconds of the M6.0 Napa mainshock. The two other missed events occurred offshore in a region with sparse station coverage in the Eureka area.\nSince its inception, ElarmS has evolved and adapted to meet new challenges. On May 30, 2015, an extraordinarily deep (678km) M7.8 teleseism in Japan generated 5 false event detections for earthquakes greater than M4 within a minute due to the simultaneous arrival of the P-waves at stations throughout California. In order to improve the speed and accuracy of the ElarmS detections, we are currently exploring new methodologies to quickly evaluate incoming triggers from individual stations. Rapidly determining whether or not a trigger at a given station is due to a local earthquake or some other source (such as a distant teleseism) could dramatically increase the confidence in individual triggers and reduce false alerts.",

            "abstract": "Most models of planet formation only model the final, giant impact, stage of planetary accretion and therefore rely on previous work to establish their initial distributions of planetary embryos and planetesimals. However, recent works have suggested that the growth of planetary embryos has a stronger radial dependence than previously thought (inside-out growth; see Minton and Levison 2014), whereby Mars-mass embryos could grow at 1.0 au millions of years before lunar-mass objects grow at 2.0 au. Therefore previous models that assume a uniform distribution of planetary embryos and planetesimals across the inner solar system require re-investigation.\nOne such model is the Grand Tack scenario (Walsh et al. 2011) that has found success in reproducing the Earth/Mars mass ratio and accretion timescales when migrating giant planets truncate the disk of inner solar system rocky material. We will show that this scenario depends on the existence of planetary embryos out beyond 1.5 au at the time of Jupiter's \"tack\". Using a Lagrangian planetary accretion code capable of modeling the formation of planets directly from planetesimals (LIPAD; see Levison et al. 2012), we can then place constraints on the timing of the Grand Tack scenario by the dynamical requirements of planetary embryo growth.",

            "abstract": "We measured dithionite extractable iron and manganese along with a variety of bulk sedimentary solid and dissolved phases to constrain the diagenetic reactions occurring within the sediment package of the Grenada Basin, which resides within the southern Lesser Antilles volcanic arc region. Core material was obtained during IODP Expedition 340, and for this presentation we focus primarily on two sites (U1399 and U1400) located off the island of Martinique. Sediments in this region include tephra-rich volcanic sands, hemipelagic mud sequences, and carbonate-rich sequences, and vary widely in their proportions over short time and distance intervals. Regardless of the main sediment type, organic carbon contents are uniformly low with average values of 0.28 ± 0.08% for U1399 and 0.23 ± 0.15% for U1400. Carbonate contents are more variable ranging between 1 and 40% in both cores and these variations likely reflect variable dilution with volcanogenic sediment. Pore fluids in U1399 exhibit a decrease in Ca, Mg, and Sr with depth, indicative of carbonate precipitation, and a decrease in total dissolved S to values less than 10 mM by 160 meters. A reaction zone is present at ~70 meters in core U1400, with a slight increase in ammonium and alkalinity but a small decrease in total dissolved S. Ca, Mg, and Sr show little to no change with depth. Pore fluid Sr isotope data show a surprisingly narrow range of values suggesting minimal reaction of pore fluid with volcanic material. Reactive Fe ranges from 0.15 to 1.5% in both cores whereas reactive Mn ranges from 0 to 0.3%. For this presentation we assess the relationships among reactive iron, manganese, organic carbon and other constituents with an emphasis on how the presence of volcanic material might influence the cycling of these components during diagenesis.",

These regions nevertheless experienced extended Medieval-era droughts that were more persistent than any historical event, providing crucial targets in the paleoclimate record for benchmarking the severity of future drought risks. We use an empirical drought reconstruction and three soil moisture metrics from 17 state-of-the-art general circulation models to show that these models project significantly drier conditions in the later half of the 21st century compared to the 20th century and earlier paleoclimatic intervals. This desiccation is consistent across most of the models and moisture balance variables, indicating a coherent and robust drying response to warming despite the diversity of models and metrics analyzed. Notably, future drought risk will likely exceed even the driest centuries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1100–1300 CE) in both moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) future emissions scenarios, leading to unprecedented drought conditions during the last millennium.",

            "abstract": "World oil production increased to about 74 million barrels per day by January 2005, and was fairly constant until 2011 when it started to increase to 77.8 mb/d in 2014. This spectacular increase of 4 mb/d was almost entirely due to a sharp increase in production in the US from shale formations, called light tight oil (LTO). World oil production minus this increase in US LTO Production has been flat since 2005 at about 74 mb/d. When US production starts to decline, world oil production likely will as well. That surge is forecast to end soon because LTO is expensive to produce, the first year decline rates are extremely high requiring many new wells each year to maintain or increase production and the most productive locations have already been drilled. It is unprofitable for the Exploration and Production (E&P) companies. Full-year free cash flow has been negative for most tight oil E&P companies since 2009. The total negative cash flow for the 19 largest E&P companies totaled $10.5B in 2014. The surge in US LTO production created an imbalance in global supply and demand and resulted in a 50% decrease in the price of oil. The tight-oil producers who were are financially marginal at an oil price greater than $90 per barrel are even more so at the lower price. As a result the surge in US production of LTO is declining, making it unlikely that world oil production will exceed the present value of about 28 Gb/yr (equivalent to 75 mb/d) (175 EJ/yr). Many of the SRES (IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios) and RCP (IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways) projections (especially RCP 8.5 and 6) require CO2 emissions due to oil consumption in the range of 32 Gb/yr to 57 Gb/yr (200 to 350 EJ/yr). The higher values would require a doubling of world oil production. It is highly uncertain whether the higher CO2 scenarios will be reached. This is an element of uncertainty missing from most considerations of future climate change.",

            "abstract": "V-type asteroids are a particular class of asteroids whose surface mineralogy is associated to a basaltic composition. Currently, the only known source of these asteroids in the Main Belt is (4) Vesta. This asteroid is located in the inner belt (2.1 < a < 2.5 AU), and has associated a dynamical family formed by the impact ejecta of two large craters excavated on its basaltic surface some 2 and 1 Gyr ago, respectively. Thus, many V-type asteroids belong to the Vesta family. However, an increasing number of V-type asteroids is found outside the limits of the family. Some of these asteroids, especially those located in the inner belt, are explained as dynamical fugitives from the family. Others cannot be linked to the Vesta family nor to (4) Vesta, neither dynamically nor mineralogically. The most paradoxal cases are the V-type asteroids found beyond 2.5 AU, in the central (2.5 < a < 2.8 AU) and outer (2.8 < a < 3.2 AU) parts of the Main Belt, where no local source of basaltic material is recognized. In this work, we propose a coherent dynamical mechanism to explain the delivery of V-type asteroids originated in the inner belt to the central and outer belt. This mechanism involves the planetary instability during the epoch when the outer planets were migrating due to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals, some 4 Gyr ago. The instability is caused by mutual planetary encounters in the framework of the jumping Jupiter model with initially five outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn and three ice giants. As a consequence of this instability, an ice giant is temporarily scattered into the asteroid belt and helps to disperse the asteroids in semimajor axis by up to ~0.5 AU. The V-type asteroids dispersed by this mechanism could have originated either in an older cratering event on the surface of (4) Vesta, or in the fragmentation of another basaltic asteroid in the inner belt that likely have existed during the epoch of planetary migration. We tested several configurations of hypothetical Vesta-like families, and analised how they are dispersed. We also verified that, after the instability phase, the asteroids scattered to the central and outer belt remain stable over Gyr timescales, being a plausible explanation for the V-type asteroids found in these regions, like (1459) Magnya.",

            "abstract": "The Chugach-St. Elias Mountains in southeastern Alaska exhibit extreme topography as a result of the subduction and collision of the Yakutat microplate with the North American plate. Extensive glaciation in the area, coupled with the active tectonics, makes the Chugach-St. Elias Mountains the ideal site to investigate the resulting spatial and temporal variations in exhumation. The St. Elias Mountains have experienced three major climate changes including the start of regional glaciation at ~5.5 Ma, the onset of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere during the Plio-Pleistocene Transition to colder temperatures at 2.5 Ma, and a change in global climate cyclicity during the mid-Pleistocene Transition from 1.2-0.7 Ma. Our goal is to determine whether these climate changes result in shifts in the rates and patterns of regional exhumation due to the intensification of glacial erosion. We investigate the late Cenozoic sediments from five boreholes that were drilled by IODP Expedition 341 along a transect crossing the Yakutat shelf (offshore Bering glacier) and into the deep-sea Surveyor Fan in the Gulf of Alaska. Magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy on these sediments establish an up to 10 Ma depositional history in the boreholes. To study rock exhumation of the sediment source over time, 17 detrital samples from various depths in the cores were dated using zircon fission track thermochronology. Single grain cooling ages range from 302.8 Ma to 0.2 Ma, and contain composite age populations with peaks coinciding with major regional tectonic events providing information on sediment provenance and exhumation. All single grains were also double dated using U-Pb dating to identify and eliminate volcanic grains from the sample. Common U-Pb age populations are 53, 62, 70, and 98 Ma with minor populations of 117, 154, and 170 Ma. These ages are being used to better constrain sediment provenance and reconstruct past glacial catchments.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires can feedback the atmosphere by impacting atmospheric radiation transfer and cloud microphysics through emitting smoke particles and the land-air heat and water fluxes through modifying land-surface properties. While the impacts through smoke particles have been extensively investigated recently, very few studies have been conducted to examine the impacts through land-surface property change. This study is to fill this gap by examining the climate responses to the changes in land-surface properties induced by several large wildfires in the United States. Satellite remote sensing tools including MODIS and Landsat are used to quantitatively evaluate the land-surface changes characterized by reduced vegetation coverage and increased albedo over long post-fire periods. Variations in air and soil temperature and moisture of the burned areas are also monitored. Climate modeling is conducted to simulate climate responses and understand the related physical processes and interactions. The preliminary results indicate noticeable changes in water and heat transfers from the ground to the atmosphere through several mechanisms. Larger albedo reduces solar radiation absorbed on the ground, leading to less energy for latent and sensible heat fluxes. With smaller vegetation coverage, water transfer from the soil to the atmosphere through transpiration is reduced. Meanwhile, the Bowen ratio becomes larger after burning and therefore more solar energy absorbed on the ground is converted into sensible heat instead of being used as latent energy for water phase change. In addition, reduced vegetation coverage reduces roughness and increases wind speed, which modify dynamic resistances to water and heat movements. As a result of the changes in the land-air heat and water fluxes, clouds and precipitation as well as other atmospheric processes are affected by wildfires.",

If electron escape from the acceleration region can be neglected, the electron distribution function is determined by a balance between diffusive acceleration and collisions. Such a scenario admits a stationary solution for the electron distribution function that takes the form of a kappa distribution. We show that the evolution toward this kappa distribution involves a \"wave front\" propagating forwards in velocity space, so that electrons of higher energy are accelerated later; the acceleration time scales as the power three-half of the energy. At sufficiently high energies escape from the finite-length acceleration region will eventually dominate. For such energies, the electron velocity distribution function is obtained by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation in the \"leaky-box\" approximation. Solutions are obtained in the limit of a small escape rate from an acceleration region that can effectively be considered a thick target.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in colloid transport science have demonstrated the importance of surface roughness on colloid attachment; however, few studies have investigated the influence of nano-scale roughness on colloid detachment. This study explores the effects of flow perturbations on a variety of mineral surfaces, as well as NaOH treated (i.e. rough, Figure 1a) and untreated (i.e. smooth, Figure 1b) surfaces for colloids of various sizes attached in an impinging jet system under flowing and stagnant conditions. These experiments showed minimal detachment from the roughened surfaces (treated glass) and significant detachment from the smooth surfaces (untreated glass and mica). A correlation between residence time and attachment irreversibility was also revealed, indicating that the particles that spent the longest time attached to the surface developed the strongest adhesion. The representative surface-heterogeneity model developed by Pazmino et al. (2014) was used to conduct detachment simulations under similar geochemical and flow conditions. While simulated results show qualitative agreement with experimental results, they tend to over-predict detachment, highlighting differences among simulated versus real surfaces, which may be related to surface roughness. These results suggest that more sophisticated models that incorporate surface roughness and time-based adhesion are needed to accurately predict colloid detachment in environmental systems.",

            "abstract": "The western USA is integrally reliant upon winter season snowpack, which supplies 3/4 of the region’s fresh water and buffers against seasonal aridity on agricultural, ecosystem, and urban water demands. By the end of the 21st century, western USA snowpack (SWE) could decline by 40-70%, snowfall by 25-40%, more winter storms could tend towards rain rather than snow, and the peak timing of snowmelt will shift several weeks earlier in the season. Further, there has been evidence that mountain ranges could face more accelerated warming (elevational dependent warming) due to climate change. These future trends have largely been derived from global climate models (CMIP5) which can’t resolve some of the more relatively narrow mountain ranges, like the California Sierra Nevada, in great detail. Therefore, due to the importance of orographic uplift on weather fronts, eastern Pacific sea-surface temperature anomalies, atmospheric river events, and mesoscale convective systems, high-resolution global scale modeling techniques are necessary to properly resolve western USA mountain range climatology. Variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) are a promising next-generation technique to analyze both past and future hydroclimatic trends in the region. VRGCMs serve as a bridge between regional and global models by allowing for high-resolution in areas of interest, eliminate lateral boundary forcings (and resultant model biases), allow for more dynamically inclusive large-scale climate teleconnections, and require smaller simulation times and lower data storage demand (compared to conventional global models). This presentation focuses on validating these next-generation models as well as projecting future climate change scenario impacts on several of the western USA's key hydroclimate metrics (e.g., two-meter surface temperature, snow cover, snow water equivalent, and snowfall) to inform water managers and policy makers and offer resilience to climate change impacts facing the region.",

            "abstract": "Historical research at the Alsea Watershed Study (1958-1973), in the Oregon Coast Range, demonstrated that clear-cut harvesting, with complete removal of riparian vegetation, can result in large and dramatic changes in mean daily, maximum daily, diurnal variation, and annual patterns in stream temperature (Ts). This previous research was instrumental in the addition of regulations in the Oregon Forest Practices Act of 1971, necessitating retention of streamside vegetation (riparian management zones) in harvest units to maintain water quality and aquatic habitat. Due to the ecological importance of Ts, preventing or mitigating changes in the thermal regime following land use activities, such as forest harvesting, is a primary focus of contemporary forest watershed management. The Alsea Watershed Study Revisited (2006-Present) has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the Ts responses to contemporary forest harvesting practices and compare these with the impacts from the 1960’s harvest. In general, Ts increases from late spring through about mid-July, with peak Ts occuring between about mid-July and mid-August, after which Ts decreases into the fall. During the pre-harvest period (2006-2008; n=244) the June to September mean daily maximum Ts was 13.0°C in Flynn Creek (control) and 12.0°C in Needle Branch (harvested). In the post-harvest period (2010-2012; n=240) the June to September mean daily maximum Ts was 12.4°C in Flynn Creek (control) and 12.0°C in Needle Branch (harvested). Similarly, the difference (Flynn Ck – Needle Branch) in 7 day moving mean of daily maximum Ts decreased from the pre-harvest (1.0°C) to the post-harvest (0.3°C) period, which was principally driven by a decrease in Ts in the control catchment. Longitudinal sampling of Ts within Needle Branch indicated a cooling trend such that the slight increases in post-harvest Ts weren’t detectable in downstream, unharvested stream reaches.",

But storytelling draws us to a magical place. Our students, with prior experience in either a geology or astronomy course, were invited to explore Mars in a special topics course at Johnson County Community College through reading The Martian by Andy Weir. As they traveled with astronaut Mark Watney, the students used Google Mars, Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS), and learning modules from the Mars for Earthlings web site to investigate the terrain and the processes at work in the past and present on Mars. Our goal was to apply their understanding of processes on Earth in order to explain and predict what they observed on Mars courtesy of the remote sensing opportunities available from Viking, Pathfinder, the Mars Exploration Rovers, and Maven missions; sort of an inter-planetary uniformitarianism. Astronaut Mark Watney’s fictional journey from Acidalia Planitia to Schiaparelli Crater was analyzed using learning modules in Mars for Earthlings and exercises that we developed based on Google Mars, JMARS, Rotating Sky Explorer, and Science Friday podcasts. Each student also completed an individual project that either focused on a particular region that Astronaut Mark Watney traveled through or a problem that he faced. Through this open-inquiry learning style, they determined some processes that shaped Mars such as crater impacts, volcanism, fluid flow, mass movement, and groundwater sapping and also investigated the efficacy of solar energy as a power source based on location and the likelihood of regolith potential as a mineral matter source for soil.",

New geologic mapping, geochemistry, and Ar-Ar and U-Pb dating document 2 brief periods of magmatism resulting in 5 nested calderas and related plutons in sections locally ≥9 km thick. Early magmatism at ~29 Ma included the Deep Canyon caldera in CAM, and in the SSR, pre-caldera rhyolites, ~5 km of pre- and post-collapse intermediate lavas and rhyolite tuff that filled Job Canyon caldera (JC, ~29.4 to 28.8 Ma), and the >4-5 km thick IXL pluton (~28.5 Ma) that intruded JC and is compositionally similar to the tuff and lava flows. The second period included 3 ignimbrite units in 3 calderas: small-volume tuff of Louderback Mountains (LM, low-silica rhyolite; ≥600 m thick; ~25.3 Ma); multiple cooling units of tuff of Poco Canyon (PC, high-silica rhyolite; ≤4.5 km thick; ~25.3 Ma); and ≥2500 km3 of tuff of Elevenmile Canyon (EC, trachydacite to rhyolite; ≤4.5 km thick; 25.1 Ma) that covers ~1600 km2 and extends east from SSR to the northern Desatoya Mountains. The composite Freeman Creek pluton (granodiorite, ~25.0 Ma; granite, ~24.8 Ma) and Chalk Mountain rhyolite porphyry (~25.2 Ma) and granite (~24.8 Ma) plutons intruded LM, PC and EC calderas. Radiogenic isotopes in all caldera units are similar (Sri~0.7050, ΕNd~0.0), while oxygen isotope compositions are variable (δ18Oquartz=5.7-8.4‰, δ18Ozircon=4.1-6.3‰), corresponding to a magmatic range of 5.6-7.6‰, including <6‰ values for JC and lower PC rhyolites. U-Pb zircon dating shows homogeneous age populations and few/no xenocrysts or antecrysts. These data show that (1) thick plutons (>2-5 km) underlie compositionally and temporally related caldera-filling ignimbrites, (2) caldera-forming cycles are isotopically variable, requiring temporally and spatially distinct magma sources, and (3) caldera magmas have a strong mantle affinity and overlap isotopically (Sr, Nd, and O) with regional Late Cenozoic basalts.",

            "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges that interdisciplinary researchers face is finding suitable datasets in order to advance their science; this problem remains consistent across multiple disciplines. A surprising number of scientists, when asked what tool they use for data discovery, reply “Google”, which is an acceptable solution in some cases but not even Google can find -or cares to compile- all the data that’s relevant for science and particularly geo sciences. If a dataset is not discoverable through a well known search provider it will remain dark data to the scientific world.\n\nFor the past year, BCube, an EarthCube Building Block project, has been developing, testing and deploying a technology stack capable of data discovery at web-scale using the ultimate dataset: The Internet. This stack has 2 principal components, a web-scale crawling infrastructure and a semantic aggregator. The web-crawler is a modified version of Apache Nutch (the originator of Hadoop and other big data technologies) that has been improved and tailored for data and data service discovery. The second component is semantic aggregation, carried out by a python-based workflow that extracts valuable metadata and stores it in the form of triples through the use semantic technologies.\n\nWhile implementing the BCube stack we have run into several challenges such as a) scaling the project to cover big portions of the Internet at a reasonable cost, b) making sense of very diverse and non-homogeneous data, and lastly, c) extracting facts about these datasets using semantic technologies in order to make them usable for the geosciences community.\n\nDespite all these challenges we have proven that we can discover and characterize data that otherwise would have remained in the dark corners of the Internet. Having all this data indexed and ‘triplelized’ will enable scientists to access a trove of information relevant to their work in a more natural way. An important characteristic of the BCube stack is that all the code we have developed is open sourced and available to anyone who wants to experiment and collaborate with the project at: http://github.com/b-cube/",

Our team will assess the value of the ICESat-2 water level product using two flood model use cases, one over the California Bay Delta and one over the Niger Inland Delta. Application of the ALT13 product into routine operations will be ensured via an ALT13 database integrated into the pillar “Global Flood Service and Toolbox” (GFST) of the Global Flood Partnership (GFP). GFP is a cooperation framework between scientific organizations and flood disaster managers worldwide to develop flood observational and modelling infrastructure, leveraging on existing initiatives for better predicting and managing flood disaster impacts and flood risk globally. GFP is hosted as an Expert Working Group by the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS). The objective of this EA project is to make the ICESat-2 water level data available to the international GFP community. The EA team believes that the ALT13 product, after successful demonstration of its value in model calibration/validation and monitoring of large floodplain inundation dynamics, should be made easily accessible to the GFP. The GFST will host data outputs and tools from different flood models and for different applications and regions. All these models can benefit from ALT13 if made available to GFP through GFST. Here, we will introduce both test cases and their model setups and report on first preliminary “capabilities” test runs with the Niger model and ICESat-1 as well as radar altimeter data. Based on our results, we will also reflect on expected capabilities and potential of the ICESat-2 mission for river observations.",

With instruments digitizing large amounts of sensor data from many sources, the scientific discovery process becomes a large-scale search process. However, insight generation is still a key problem and is especially complex in Geoscience, particularly when exploratory studies involve fusion of large data from various instruments in a manual labor-intensive manner.\nWe propose an approach for a computer-aided discovery infrastructure that automatically explores the connection between physics models and empirical data to accelerate the pace of new discoveries. The approach uses (1) A system engaging scientists to programmatically express hypothesized Geoscience scenarios, constraints, and model variations, so as to automatically explore and evaluate the combinatorial search space of possible explanations in parallel on a variety of data sets. This automated system employs machine learning to support algorithmic choice and workflow reconfiguration allowing systematic pruning of the search space of applied algorithms and parameters based on historical results. (2) A cloud-based environment allowing scientists to conduct powerful exploratory analyses on large data sets that reside in data centers. Various search modes are provided, including a mode where scientists can iteratively guide the search based on intermediate results. This functionality directs the system to identify more Geospace features that are analogous or related in various ways. (3) Scientist input is used to configure programmable crawlers that automate and scale the search for interesting phenomena on cloud-based infrastructures. We discuss various application scenarios to show the impact of workflow configuration on scientific feature detection.\nAcknowledgements.

            "abstract": "Driven by the diurnal solar heating, atmospheric tides are global scale oscillations in density, pressure and temperature. They are responsible for a large fraction of the variability of the atmosphere and the circulation and transport processes that stem from this variability. Here we present first observations of tides in the Martian atmosphere from the Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN) Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS). CO2+ (B2\u0006Σ+→X2\u0005Π) UV doublet emission intensities are isolated from limb profiles over the 100-190 km altitude range using a multiple linear regression procedure, and CO2 densities are then obtained by fitting a Chapman layer. Variations of the CO2 density exhibit significant persistent structure with longitudinal wavenumbers 1, 2 and 3 in a fixed local solar time frame, and such a structure points to non-migrating tides. Specific tidal modes are identified through analysis of the amplitudes and phases of the various wavenumber components and their variation with latitude. The wave-2 component is dominated by the diurnal eastward-moving DE1 tide at the equator and the diurnal stationary D0 tide at the midlatitudes. Wave-3 is dominated by the diurnal eastward-moving DE2 tide, with an unknown tide becoming dominant north of 30°\u000eN. Structure in the wave-1 component can be explained by the semidiurnal westward-moving SW1 tide. Our observations are consistent with past observations by Mars Express SPectroscopy for Investigation of Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars (SPICAM) [Withers et al., 2011], Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) aerobraking data [Withers et al., 2003; Moudden and Forbes, 2008] and MGS electron density measurements [Cahoy et al., 2007].",

The underlying reason for this disagreement between measurement and theory is not yet understood, but is important for the interpretation of strain data. Here we apply tidal analysis to the data of volumetric strain and water level documented in the Fuxin well, northeastern China, before and after the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku earthquake, the 2012 Mw 8.6 Sumatra earthquake and the 2015 Mw 7.9 Nepal earthquake. Before each earthquake, water level fluctuations in the well had a negative phase shift due to the delay of groundwater flow to the well driven by the tidal volumetric strain of aquifers. Immediately following each earthquake, however, the phase of the water-level fluctuations began to lead that of the volumetric strain, suggesting that the coseismic change of strain may reflect the coseismic change of pore pressure in the aquifer. Furthermore, the hypothesis is consistent with the available data for the amplitude of the co-seismic volumetric strain and water level.",

            "abstract": "The PETM is characterized by a transient group of nannoplankton whose range is restricted to the interval defined by the carbon isotope excursion. Many of these so-called excursion taxa belong to the genus Discoaster, a group characterized by multi-rayed taxa. The origin of the Discoaster excursion taxa is debated, with ocean acidification a potential cause1. The excursion taxa are not cosmopolitan and the controls on their distribution is also poorly understood. We have observed excursion Discoaster taxa in the PETM from shelf sections in the US Atlantic Coastal Plain and obtained new information on their morphology and relationship to environmental change. The excursion taxa show progressive ray deformation starting near the base of the event with inter-ray irregularity, followed by ray-tip deformation and ray malformation, and, ultimately, ray loss. Tip deformation and ray malformation and loss characterize the dominant excursion taxa whose ranges extend through the peak of the event.\nThe deformational features shown by Discoaster are consistent with decreased calcification. Excursion Discoaster constitutes a minor component of the nannoplankton assemblage, with co-existing nannoplankton displaying no morphological change during the PETM. An explanation for this dichotomy is provided by the depth habitat of Discoaster. The genus is thought to have inhabited the deeper photic zone near the nutricline2, and we postulate that the excursion taxa are adaptations to undersaturated waters in this depth range. We have tested this explanation with EMIC simulations using GENIE in coastal and UVic in open ocean sites. In general, our results suggest that the excursion taxa are present at locations where calcite saturation shows a pronounced decrease during the first ~10kyr of the event. We conclude therefore that the excursion Discoaster represents an adaptation to diminished saturation within the lower part of the photic zone.\n",

            "abstract": "The study proposes to use Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing techniques to spatially model Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) disease in maize growing areas in Kenya. Results from this work will be used for prediction, monitoring and to guide intervention on MLN. This will minimize maize yield losses resulting from MLN infestation and thus safeguard the livelihoods of maize farmers in Kenya. MLN was first reported in Kenya in September 2011 in Bomet county. It then subsequently spread to other parts in Kenya. Maize crops are susceptible to MLN at all growth stages. Once infected the only option left for the farmers is to burn their maize plantations. Infection rate and damage is very high affecting yields and sometimes causing complete loss of maize yield.The modelling exercise will cover the period prior to and after the incidence of MLN. Specifically, the analysis will integrate spatio-temporal information on maize phenology and field surveys with the intention of delineating the extent of MLN infestation and the degree of damage as a result of MLN. Additionally, the task will identify potential predisposing factors leading to MLN resurgence and spread and to predict potential areas where MLN is likely to spread and to estimate the potential impact of MLN on the farm holders. The area of study for this task will be Bomet County. Historical and current environmental and spatial indicators including temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, vegetation health and crop cover will be fed into a model in order to determine the main factors that aide the occurrence and the spread of MLN. Multi-spectral image processing will be used to produce indices to study maize crop health whilst image classification techniques will be used to identify crop cover clusters by differentiating the variations in spectral signatures in the area of study and hence distinguish infected, unaffected maize crops and other crop cover classes. Variables from these indicators will then be weighted in a spatial model and be used as a basis for generating site-specific MLN prediction maps that will guide policy on MLN management in Kenya. The broader\nobjective is to document a model that can be up-scaled and replicated in other maize producing areas in Kenya affected by MLN.",

            "abstract": "New sea surface temperature (SST) records from the southern Pacific and southern Atlantic Oceans allow assessment of similarities and differences in climate evolution across ocean basins, hemispheres, and latitudes over the last 5 million years. Our high-resolution, alkenone-derived SST records from ODP Sites 1088 (South Atlantic, 41°S) and 1125 (South Pacific, 42°S) share strong structural similarities. When compared with SST records from the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, these records provide compelling evidence for broadly hemispherically symmetrical open-ocean temperature evolution in both ocean basins as tropical warm pools contracted over the Plio-Pleistocene. This symmetry in temperature evolution occurs despite strong asymmetries in the development of the cryosphere over this interval, which was marked by extensive northern hemisphere ice sheet growth. Parallel SST evolution across ocean basins and hemispheres suggests that on longterm (>105 yr) timescales, many regions of the world ocean are more sensitive to the global energy budget than to local or regional climate dynamics, although important exceptions include coastal upwelling zone SSTs, high latitude SSTs, and benthic δ18O. Our analysis further reveals that throughout the last 5 Ma, temperature evolution in the extra-tropical Pacific of both hemispheres is very similar to the evolution of SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific upwelling zone, revealing tight coupling between the growth of meridional and equatorial Pacific zonal temperature gradients over this interval as both the extra-tropics and the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue underwent cooling. Finally, while long term temperature evolution is broadly consistent across latitudes and ocean basins throughout the entire Plio-Pleistocene, we see evidence that climate coupling on orbital timescales strengthened significantly at 2.7 Ma, at which point obliquity-band coherence emerges among diverse SST records. We attribute this emergence of coherence to a strengthened greenhouse gas feedback at the obliquity frequency that was initiated with the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation, as proposed by Herbert et al. (2010).",

            "abstract": "Fire frequency has dramatically increased in the tundra of northern Alaska, which has major implications for the carbon budget of the region and the functioning of these ecosystems that support important wildlife species. We applied the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL) model to investigate both the short- and long-term post-fire succession of plant and soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus fluxes and stocks along a burn severity gradient in the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire scar in northern Alaska. We compared the patterns of biomass and soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries with different burn severities and warming intensities. Modeling results indicated that the early regrowth of post-fire tundra vegetation was limited primarily by its canopy photosynthetic potential, rather than nutrient availability. The long-term recovery of C balance from fire disturbance is mainly determined by the internal redistribution of nutrients among ecosystem components, rather than the supply of nutrients from external sources (e.g., nitrogen deposition and fixation, phosphorus weathering). Soil organic matter is the principal source of plant-available nutrients and determines the spatial variation of vegetation biomass across the North Slope of Alaska. Across the North Slope of Alaska, we examined the effects of changes in N and P cycles on tundra C budgets under climate warming. Our results indicate that the ongoing climate warming in Arctic enhances mineralization and leads to a net transfer of nutrient from soil organic matter to vegetation, thereby stimulating tundra plant growth and increased C sequestration in the tundra ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Coral reefs are threatened at local to global scales by a litany of anthropogenic impacts, including overfishing, coastal development, marine and watershed pollution, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification. However, available data for the primary indicator of coral reef condition — proportional cover of living coral — are surprisingly sparse and show patterns that contradict the prevailing understanding of how environment impacts reef condition. Remote sensing is the only available tool for acquiring synoptic, uniform data on reef condition at regional to global scales. Discrimination between coral and other reef benthos relies on narrow wavebands afforded by imaging spectroscopy. The same spectral information allows non-invasive quantification of photosynthetic pigment composition, which shows unexpected phenological trends. There is also potential to link biodiversity with optical diversity, though there has been no effort in that direction. Imaging spectroscopy underlies the light-use efficiency model for reef primary production by quantifying light capture, which in turn indicates biochemical capacity for CO2 assimilation. Reef calcification is strongly correlated with primary production, suggesting the possibility for an optics-based model of that aspect of reef function, as well. By scaling these spectral models for use with remote sensing, we can vastly improve our understanding of reef structure, function, and overall condition across regional to global scales. By analyzing those remote sensing products against ancillary environmental data, we can construct secondary models to predict reef futures in the era of global change. This final point is the objective of CORAL (COral Reef Airborne Laboratory), a three-year project funded under NASA’s Earth Venture Suborbital-2 program to investigate the relationship between coral reef condition at the ecosystem scale and various nominal biogeophysical forcing parameters.",

            "abstract": "Convection in tropical regions may be enhanced by orographic barriers. The orographic enhancement is an intensification of rain rates caused by the forced lifting of air over a mountainous structure. Orographic heavy rainfall events, occasionally, comes along by flooding, debris flow and substantial amount of looses, either economics or human lives. Most of the heavy convective rainfall events, occurred in Colombia, have left a lot of victims and material damages by flash flooding. An urgent action is required by either scientific communities or society, helping to find preventive solutions against these kind of events.\nVarious scientific literature reports address the feedback process between the convection and the local orographic structures. The orographic enhancement could arise by several physical mechanism: precipitation transport on leeward side, convection triggered by the forcing of air over topography, the seeder-feeder mechanism, among others. The identification of the physical mechanisms for orographic enhancement of rainfall has not been studied over Colombia. As far as we know, orographic convective tropical rainfall is just the main factor for the altitudinal belt of maximum precipitation, but the lack of detailed hydro-meteorological measurements have precluded a complete understanding of the tropical rainfall in Colombia and its complex terrain.\nThe emergence of the multifractal theory for rainfall has opened a field of research which builds a framework for parsimonious modeling of physical process. Studies about the scaling behavior of orographic rainfall have found some modulating functions between the rainfall intensity probability distribution and the terrain elevation. The overall objective is to advance in the understanding of the orographic influence over the Colombian tropical rainfall based on observations and scaling-analysis techniques. We use rainfall maps, weather radars scans and ground-based rainfall data. The research strategy is the analysis of rainfall fields via first-order statistical properties, scaling functions, structure functions and spectral analysis, taking into account cloud-motion directions over mountainous slopes (windward/leeward side) and timing of the diurnal cycle. The analysis is developed for some Colombia's locations.",

            "abstract": "From their initial eruptions in south-central Oregon, Columbia River basalt (CRB) volcanism propagated rapidly north, with the largest eruptions being ~300 km north of the Yellowstone hotspot track. We combine upper mantle seismic tomography, CRB eruption timing constraints, geochemical evolution of magmas, uplift history, and the tectonic context to construct a well-constrained model for the origin of the CRB eruptions. Arrival of the Yellowstone plume below south-central Oregon initiated a north-propagating rollback-style delamination of remnant Farallon lithosphere from the base of northern Oregon, enabled by ocean-lithosphere detachment as sills were emplacement near the (continental or oceanic) Moho. This drew Yellowstone asthenosphere to the north. When delamination propagated beneath the Cretaceous Wallowa pluton, its garnet-rich (dense) root foundered. Root foundering led to: pluton uplift (creating the Wallowa Mts); a mantle return flow that greatly amplified magmatic production; and assimilation of continental crust in the vicinity of a large magma chamber created by the evacuated pluton root. Thus, much of the CRB eruptive volume and history is attributed to lithospheric activity that was triggered by the arrival of mantle that was anomalously magmatically productive.",

Scientists are increasingly applying traditional high performance computing (HPC) solutions to solve their “Big Data” problems. While this approach has the benefit of limiting data movement, the HPC system is not optimized to run analytics, which can create problems that permeate throughout the HPC environment.\nTo solve these issues and to alleviate some of the strain on the HPC environment, the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) has created the Advanced Data Analytics Platform (ADAPT), which combines both HPC and cloud technologies to create an agile system designed for analytics. Large, commonly used data sets are stored in this system in a write once/read many file system, such as Landsat, MODIS, MERRA, and NGA. High performance virtual machines are deployed and scaled according to the individual scientist’s requirements specifically for data analysis.\nOn the software side, the NCCS and GMU are working with emerging commercial technologies and applying them to structured, binary scientific data in order to expose the data in new ways. Native NetCDF data is being stored within a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) enabling storage-proximal processing through MapReduce while continuing to provide accessibility of the data to traditional applications. Once the data is stored within HDFS, an additional indexing scheme is built on top of the data and placed into a relational database. This spatiotemporal index enables extremely fast mappings of queries to data locations to dramatically speed up analytics. These are some of the first steps toward a single unified platform that optimizes for both HPC and large-scale data analysis, and this presentation will elucidate the resulting and necessary exascale architectures required for future systems.",

Not only do we have global values for these CREs, but we can now also plot global maps of their geographical distribution. The next step in our effort to advance our knowledge of CRE is to systematically assess the contributions of prevailing cloud systems to the global values. The presentation addresses this issue directly. We identify the world's prevailing cloud systems, which we call \"Cloud Regimes\" (CRs) via clustering analysis of MODIS (Aqua-Terra) daily joint histograms of Cloud Top Pressure and Cloud Optical Thickness (TAU) at 1 degree scales. We then composite CERES diurnal values of CRE (TOA, SFC, ATM) separately for each CR by averaging these values for each CR occurrence, and thus find the contribution of each CR to the global value of CRE. But we can do more. We can actually decompose vertical profiles of inferred instantaneous CRE from CloudSat/CALIPSO (2B-FLXHR-LIDAR product) by averaging over Aqua CR occurrences (since A-Train formation flying allows collocation). Such an analysis greatly enhances our understanding of the radiative importance of prevailing cloud mixtures at different atmospheric levels. We can, for example, in addition to examining whether the CERES findings on which CRs contribute to radiative cooling and warming of the atmospheric column are consistent with CloudSat, also gain insight on why and where exactly this happens from the shape of the full instantaneous CRE vertical profiles.",

A contiguous 40 km2 area of Phumdis, as these vegetative masses are locally referred to, also constitutes the only natural home of the endemic and endangered species of Manipur’s brow-antlered deer popularly known as Sangai. Appropriately notified as Keibul Lamjao National Park by Government of India, this natural feature is known to be the world’s largest floating park.\nWater quality and sediment deposition on account of soil erosion in its catchments are some of the emerging concerns along with a reported enhanced frequency and duration of flooding of the shore areas, reduced fish catch within a visibly deteriorated overall natural ecosystem. Disturbances of watershed processes, command area management practices, ineffective as indeed largely absent, waste management practices and management interventions linked to the Loktak Hydroelectric Project are often cited as the principal triggers that are seen to be responsible for the damage.\nAn effective management protocol for the Lake requires a rigorous understanding of its hydrobiology and eco-hydrodynamics. The present study is carried out to establish such a characterization of the various rivers systems draining directly into the Lake using MIKE SHE, MIKE 11 HD and MIKE 11 ECO Lab modelling platforms. Water quality modelling was limited to dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and water temperature. Model calibration was done using the available measured water quality data. The derived results were then investigated for causal correlation with anthropogenic influences to assess human impact on water resource as a primary step towards the eventual goal to design effective conservation and management practices for the entire Loktak eco-system.\nKeywords: Water quality modelling, hydrodynamic modelling, rainfall- runoff model, hydrobiology",

            "abstract": "Ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and invasion of part of this CO2 into the oceans are projected to lower the calcium carbonate saturation state. As a result, the ability of many marine organisms to calcify may be compromised, with significant impacts on ocean ecosystems throughout the Anthropocene. In laboratory manipulations, calcifying organisms have exhibited reduced calcification under elevated pCO2 conditions. However, very few experiments have observed how in situ community calcification, which incorporates complex species interactions, responds to natural variations in carbonate chemistry. Using intensive seawater sampling techniques we assess the community level sensitivity of calcification rates to natural variability in the aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) at both a tropical coral reef and temperate intertidal study site. Both sites experiences large daily variation in Ωarag during low tide due to photosynthesis, respiration, and the time at which the sites are isolated from the open ocean. On hourly timescales, we find that community level rates of calcification have only a weak dependence on variability in Ωarag at the tropical study site. At the temperate study site, although weak Ωarag sensitivity is observed during the day, nighttime community calcification rates are found to be strongly influenced by variability in Ωarag, with greater dissolution rates at lower Ωarag levels. If the short-term sensitivity of community calcification to Ωarag described here is representative of the long-term sensitivity of marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, then one would expect temperate intertidal calcifying communities to be more vulnerable than tropical coral reef calcifying communities. In particular, reductions in net community calcification, in the temperate intertidal zone may be predominately due to the nocturnal impact of ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "Oppenheimer is a floor-fractured crater located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on the Moon, and exhibits more than a dozen localized pyroclastic deposits associated with the fractures. Localized pyroclastic deposits on the Moon are thought to form as a result of intermittently explosive Vulcanian eruptions under low effusion rates, in contrast to the higher-effusion rates and Hawaiian-style fire fountaining inferred to form larger regional deposits. However, using new methods to derive iron mineralogy from Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper near-infrared spectra, we find that the mineralogy of the Oppenheimer pyroclastics is not consistent with a simple Vulcanian eruption mechanism.\nThe Oppenheimer pyroclastic deposits are mixtures of pyroxene sourced from the crater floor, juvenile clinopyroxene (CPX), and juvenile iron-rich glass. A Vulcanian (plugged conduit) eruption should cause significant country rock to be incorporated into the pyroclastic deposit. However, large areas within many of the deposits exhibit spectra consistent with high abundances of juvenile phases (glass or CPX mixed with glass) and very little floor material. Thus, we propose that at least some portion of these deposits must have erupted via a Strombolian or more continuous fire fountaining eruption at higher effusion rates. Significant along-fracture mineralogical variations within many of the deposits suggest multiple eruptions and that eruption styles may have been variable in time and space. Diviner mid-infrared spectra also indicate that these local deposits may be much more iron-rich than regional pyroclastic deposits, and thus are valuable resource targets. These results suggest that local lunar pyroclastic deposits may have a more complex origin and mode of emplacement than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "Impervious surfaces and stormwater drainage networks transmit rainfall quickly to urban stream systems with greater frequency, volume, energy, and pollutant loadings than in predevelopment conditions. This has a well-established negative impact on stream ecology, channel morphology, and water quality. Green infrastructure retrofits for urban drainage systems promote more natural hydrologic pathways by disconnecting concentrated flows. However, they are expensive due to high land costs and physical constraints. If a systematic strategy for siting green infrastructure is sought to restore natural flows throughout an urban catchment, greater knowledge of the drainage patterns and areas contributing frequent surface runoff is necessary. Five diverse urban watersheds in Knoxville, TN, were assessed using high-resolution topography, land cover, and artificial drainage network data to identify how surface connectivity differs among watersheds and contributes to altered flow regimes. Rainfall-runoff patterns were determined from continuous rainfall and streamflow monitoring over the previous ten years. Fine-scale flowpath connectivity of impervious surfaces was measured by both a binary approach and by a method incorporating runoff potential by saturation excess. The effect of the spatial distribution of connected surfaces was investigated by incorporating several distance-weighting schema along established urban drainage flowpaths. Statistical relationships between runoff generation and connectivity were measured to determine the ability of these different measures of connectivity to predict runoff thresholds, frequency, volumes, and peak flows. Initial results suggest that rapid assessment of connected surficial flowpaths can be used to identify known green infrastructure assets and highly connected impervious areas and that the differences in connectivity measured between watersheds reflects differing runoff patterns observed in monitored data.",

            "abstract": "The lowermost part of the mantle, which is roughly halfway to the center of the earth, plays a key role as a thermal and chemical boundary layer between the solid, silicate mantle and fluid, iron outer core. Constraining the seismic velocity structure in this region provides important insights on mantle dynamics, and core-mantle interactions.\nRecently, global shear wave velocity tomography has confirmed the presence of broad plume conduits extending vertically through the lower mantle in the vicinity of major hotspots (SEMUCB-WM1, French and Romanowicz, 2015). These conduits are rooted in D\" in patches of strongly reduced shear velocity, at least some of which, such as Hawaii, appear to contain known ultra low velocity zones (e.g. Cottaar and Romanowicz, 2012). We seek to determine whether these patches generally contain ULVZs, and to contrast them with less extreme structures such as the PERM anomaly (Lekic et al., 2012). Because global tomography cannot resolve such fine scale structure, we apply forward modeling of higher frequency (10-20s) Sdiff waveforms in 3D complex structures using the Spectral Element Method. We focus on Iceland, Hawaii and the PERM anomaly, and Sdiff observations at USArray and/or dense broadband arrays in Europe. In all three cases, Sdiff waveforms are clearly distorted by these anomalies, with either a complex coda and/or evidence for amplitude focusing. As a start, we design simple cylindrical models of shear velocity reduction, and contrast the best fitting ones at each location considered in terms of diameter, height above the core-mantle boundary and strength of velocity reduction. We refine previously obtained models for Hawaii and the Perm Anomaly. For Iceland, the waveforms show a strong azimuthally dependent post-cursor, with maximum travel time delay of ~20s and focusing effects. The preliminary best fitting model shows a structure of 700km in diameter, ~15% reduction in shear wave velocity, extending ~40 km above the core-mantle boundary, in a location close to the Iceland hotspot which is in agreement with the low velocity patch in model SEMUCB_WM1.",

            "abstract": "Within the southern San Andreas transform plate boundary system, relatively little is known regarding active faulting in northern Baja California, Mexico, or offshore along the Inner Continental Borderland. The inner offshore system appears to be fed from the south by the Agua Blanca Fault (ABF), which strikes northwest across the Peninsular Ranges of northern Baja California. Therefore, the geologic slip rate for the ABF also provides a minimum slip rate estimate for the offshore system, which is connected to the north to faults in the Los Angeles region. Previous studies along the ABF determined slip rates of ~4-6 mm/yr (~10% of relative plate motion). However, these rates relied on imprecise age estimates and offset geomorphic features of a type that require these rates to be interpreted as minima, allowing for the possibility that the slip rate for the ABF may be greater. Although seismically quiescent, the surface trace of the ABF clearly reflects Holocene activity, and given its connectivity with the offshore fault system, more quantitative slip rates for the ABF are needed to better understand earthquake hazard for both US and Mexican coastal populations.\nUsing newly acquired airborne LiDAR, we have mapped primary and secondary fault strands along the segmented western 70 km of the ABF. Minimal development has left the geomorphic record of surface slip remarkably well preserved, and we have identified abundant evidence meter to km scale right-lateral displacement, including new Late Quaternary slip rate sites. We verified potential reconstructions at each site during summer 2015 fieldwork, and selected an initial group of three high potential slip rate sites for detailed mapping and geochronologic analyses. Offset landforms, including fluvial terrace risers, alluvial fans, and incised channel fill deposits, record displacements of ~5-80 m, and based on minimal soil development, none appear older than early Holocene. To quantitatively constrain landform ages, we collected surface and depth profile samples for 10Be cosmogenic exposure dating. We also identified sites for new paleoseismic excavations, and documented evidence of the last two earthquakes, each of which produced ~2.5 m of surface displacement. We expect new Holocene slip rates for the Agua Blanca Fault to be forthcoming in fall of 2015.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of tsunami amplitudes at far-field tide gauge stations is explained by aggregating the probability of tsunamis derived from individual subduction zones and scaled by their seismic moment. The observed tsunami amplitude distributions of both continental (e.g., San Francisco) and island (e.g., Hilo) stations distant from subduction zones are examined. Although the observed probability distributions nominally follow a Pareto (power-law) distribution, there are significant deviations. Some stations exhibit varying degrees of tapering of the distribution at high amplitudes and, in the case of the Hilo station, there is a prominent break in slope on log-log probability plots. There are also differences in the slopes of the observed distributions among stations that can be significant. To explain these differences we first estimate seismic moment distributions of observed earthquakes for major subduction zones. Second, regression models are developed that relate the tsunami amplitude at a station to seismic moment at a subduction zone, correcting for epicentral distance. The seismic moment distribution is then transformed to a site-specific tsunami amplitude distribution using the regression model. Finally, a mixture distribution is developed, aggregating the transformed tsunami distributions from all relevant subduction zones. This mixture distribution is compared to the observed distribution to assess the performance of the method described above. This method allows us to estimate the largest tsunami that can be expected in a given time period at a station.",

            "abstract": "The characterization of hydrologic processes in large river basins has been benefitting from a variety of remotely sensed data. These are useful in augmenting the conventional ground-surface and gage data that have long been available, or in providing what is often the only available information for ungauged river basins. The goal of this study is to demonstrate an innovative modeling approach that uses satellite data to enhance understanding of rivers, particularly ungauged rivers.\nThe paper describes a prototype system - SWAT-XG, coupling SWAT and XSECT models in a Genetic Algorithm framework, for estimating discharge and depth for ungauged rivers from space. SWAT-XG was rigorously tested in the Red River of the North basin by validating discharge and depth products from 2006 to 2010 using in-situ observations across the basin. Results show that SWAT-XG, calibrated against remotely sensed data alone (i.e., water levels from ENVISAT altimetry and water extents from LANDSAT), was able to provide estimates of daily and monthly river discharge with mean R2 values of 0.822 and 0.924, respectively, against data from three gaging stations on the main stem. SWAT-XG also simulated the discharges of smaller tributaries well (yielding a mean R2 of 0.809 over seven gaging stations), suggesting that the SWAT-XG is a powerful estimator of river discharge at a basin scale. Results also show that the SWAT-XG simulated river’s vertical dynamics quite well, providing water-depth estimates with an average R2 of 0.831.\nWe conclude that the SWAT-XG advances the ability to estimate discharge and water depth from space for ungauged rivers. SWAT-XG would help to solve global big data problem for river studies and offer potential for understanding and quantifying the global water cycles. This study also implies that in-situ discharge data may not be necessary for a successful hydrologic model calibration.",

            "abstract": "Intersecting simultaneously active pairs of faults with different orientations and opposing slip sense (\"conjugate faults\") present geometrical and kinematic problems. Such faults rarely offset each other, even when they have displacements of many km. A simple solution to the problem is that the two faults merge, either zippering up or unzippering, depending on the relationship between the angle of intersection and the slip senses. A widely recognized example of this is the so-called blind front developed in some thrust belts, where a backthrust branches off a decollement surface at depth. The decollement progressively unzippers, so that its hanging wall becomes the hanging wall of the backthrust, and its footwall becomes the footwall of the active decollement. The opposite situation commonly arises in core complexes, where conjugate low-angle normal faults merge to form a single detachment; in this case the two faults zipper up. Analogous situations may arise for conjugate pairs of strike-slip faults. We present kinematic and geometrical analyses of the Garlock and San Andreas faults in California, the Najd fault system in Saudi Arabia, the North and East Anatolian faults, the Karakoram and Altyn Tagh faults in Tibet, and the Tonale and Guidicarie faults in the southern Alps, all of which appear to have undergone zippering over distances of several tens to hundreds of km.\nThe zippering process may produce complex and significant patterns of strain and rotation in the surrounding rocks, particularly if the angle between the zippered faults is large. A zippering fault may be inactive during active movement on the intersecting faults, or it may have a slip rate that differs from either fault. Intersecting conjugate ductile shear zones behave in the same way on outcrop and micro-scales.",

While a large portion of sugarcane cultivated in Brazil is rain-fed and experiences drought influences on gas exchange, sugarcane in Hawai‘i is thought to be buffered from drought effects because it is drip irrigated. Knowledge about carbon sequestration and evapotranspiration rates is fundamental both for the prediction of sugar and biofuel production and for water resource management for the large plantations. To understand gas transfer under spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments, we investigated the leaf- soil- and stand-scale gas transfer processes at two irrigated sugarcane plantation study sites in Hawai‘i with contrasting rainfall. Gas and energy transfers were monitored using eddy covariance systems for a full- and later half- crop cycle. Leaf ecophysiological traits were measured for stands of different ages to evaluate the effects of stand age on gas transfer. Carbon sequestration rates (Fc) showed a strong relationship with solar radiation with small differences between sites. Latent heat flux expressed as the evapotranspiration rates (ET) also had a strong relationship with solar radiation, but showed seasonality due to variations in biological control (surface conductance) and atmospheric evaporative demand. The difference in ET and its responses to environments was less clear partly buffered by the differences in the stand age and seasons. The stable Fc-solar radiation relationship despite the variation in surface conductance was partly due to the saturation of net photosynthetic rates with intercellular CO2 concentration and the low sensitivity of net photosynthesis to variations in surface conductance in sugarcane with the C4 photosynthesis pathway. The response of gas transfer to periodic irrigation, rainfall and age-related changes in leaf ecophysiological traits will be discussed.",

It is often challenging and time-consuming to work with SLD, including all Level 2 satellite-retrieved data, non-rectangular subsets of Level 3 data, and model data on curvilinear grids. Researchers and data centers want user-friendly, fast, and powerful methods to specify, extract, serve, manipulate, and thus analyze, SLD. To meet these needs, large research-oriented agencies and modeling center such as NASA, DOE, and NOAA increasingly employ the netCDF Operators (NCO), an open-source scientific data analysis software package applicable to netCDF and HDF data. NCO includes extensive, fast, parallelized regridding features to facilitate analysis and intercomparison of SLD and model data.\nRemote sensing, weather and climate modeling and analysis communities face similar problems in handling SLD including how to easily: 1. Specify and mask irregular regions such as ocean basins and political boundaries in SLD (and rectangular) grids. 2. Bin, interpolate, average, or re-map SLD to regular grids. 3. Derive secondary data from given quality levels of SLD. These common tasks require a data extraction and analysis toolkit that is SLD-friendly and, like NCO, familiar in all these communities. With NCO users can 1. Quickly project SLD onto the most useful regular grids for intercomparison. 2. Access sophisticated statistical and regridding functions that are robust to missing data and allow easy specification of quality control metrics. These capabilities improve interoperability, software-reuse, and, because they apply to SLD, minimize transmission, storage, and handling of unwanted data. While SLD analysis still poses many challenges compared to regularly gridded, rectangular data, the custom analyses scripts SLD once required are now shorter, more powerful, and user-friendly.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric reanalyses have been employed in a wide variety of studies investigating processes in the changing Arctic and Antarctic. However reanalyses underperform in polar regions due in part to limitations in the background model, which are associated with spatial resolution and with inadequate representations of physical processes. Some chronic issues include the use of incorrect topography over ice sheets, persistent temperature biases, and discontinuities in time series due to abrupt changes to the observing system. These limitations provoke caution in the use of global reanalyses in polar regions, but also call into question their general applicability to evolving polar climate topics. For example, the assessment of conditions over Greenland and Antarctica in the most recent IPCC report relied heavily on limited area models rather than global reanalyses.\nThe performance of contemporary reanalyses over the north and south polar caps are reviewed with emphasis on differences in atmospheric energy and moisture budgets. In particular, the recently released MERRA-2 reanalysis is critically assessed. Significant changes that are relevant to polar regions in MERRA-2 over the previous MERRA version include an improved representation of glaciated land surfaces and sea ice albedo. Ongoing work to address issues of increased spatial resolution and the introduction of more complex physical processes related to surface hydrology over polar ice sheets will be described.",

            "abstract": "Few sea surface temperature (SST) datasets from satellites have the long temporal span needed for climate studies. The NOAA Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) on a 1/4° grid, produced at National Centers for Environmental Information, is based primarily on SSTs from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), available from 1981 to the present. AVHRR data can contain biases, particularly when aerosols are present. Over the three decade span, the largest departure of AVHRR SSTs from buoy temperatures occurred during the Mt Pinatubo and El Chichon eruptions. Therefore, in DOISST, AVHRR SSTs are bias-adjusted to match in situ SSTs prior to interpolation. This produces a consistent time series of complete SST fields that is suitable for modelling and investigating local climate phenomena like El Nino or the Pacific warm blob in a long term context. Because many biological processes and animal distributions are temperature dependent, there are also many ecological uses of DOISST (e.g., coral bleaching thermal stress, fish and marine mammal distributions), thereby providing insights into resource management in a changing ocean. The advantages and limitations of using DOISST for different applications will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The characteristic glacial and interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene underwent a climatic transition at ~430 ka known as the Mid- Brunhes Event (MBE). Numerous studies have noted that after this transition, the amplitude of the climatic cycles increased. Despite the indication of an MBE signal in many globally distributed paleoclimate records, the geographic extent of the climatic transition remains unknown. While the MBE is expressed in a number of southern hemisphere records its presence in northern hemisphere and terrestrial records is debated. Lake El’gygytgyn is located in the far- east Russian Arctic and provides the longest, most continuous record of Arctic climate (3.6 Ma). This study examines organic biomarkers in the Lake El’gygytgyn sediment core to determine if the MBE is expressed in the terrestrial Arctic. The paleoclimate reconstruction spans the interval of 0- 730 ka at a resolution of ~1.5 ka. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are utilized to reconstruct temperature variability and plant leaf wax n-alkanes are used to examine vegetation changes throughout the study interval. Statistical analysis of this, and other existing proxy data, indicates that a signal of the MBE is preserved in the Lake El’gygytgyn sediment record. BrGDGT temperature reconstructions indicate the terrestrial Arctic experienced both the warmest interglacial periods and coldest glacial periods after the MBE climatic transition. Arid glacial intervals and wetter interglacials are recorded by changes in the average chain length of n- alkanes, with wetter interglacials predominating after the MBE. Possibly, changes in Antarctic bottom water production and associated variability in North Pacific upwelling are responsible for transmitting the MBE signal from the southern hemisphere to Lake El’gygytgyn.",

            "abstract": "Selecting the reliable models for simulating column experiments is essential for the identiﬁcation of processes governing contaminant transport. The aim of this work is to use model selection criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC and KIC) for exploring the most appropriate model to avoid over-complex and/or over-parameterized models. We consider five models of different levels of complexity, including the equilibrium and non-equilibrium convection dispersion models. The simplest model (CDE1) consists of the convection-dispersion equation, and only dispersivity is calibrated against column experiments. The most complex model (MIM2) is the mobile-immobile model with four parameters calibrated (with two parameters specifically for the model). The model selection criteria are used to evaluate the probabilities of the five models. It was found that using the full covariance matrix that consider residual correlation resolve the problem that the most complex model receives almost 100% model probability, which is not explainable by available data and knowledge. The model complexity is related to the various terms of the model selection criteria, and their relation is examined by physical understanding of the alternative models and the column experiments. The model selection criteria consider the goodness-of-fit statistics, number of model parameter, sensitivity to the model parameters, and uncertainty of the parameters. Considering these factors can prevent from occurring over-complexity and over-parameterization, when selecting the appropriate models for simulating column experiments. Cross-validation is conducted to confirm the conclusions drawn based on the model selection criteria.",

            "abstract": "Scientific understanding of cadmium (Cd) cycling in North Carolina tobacco plants and soils has lagged, even as production of flue-cured tobacco remains an important part of the NC economy ($903 million in 2014). Cd is considered a tobacco contaminant. When tobacco is burned, Cd can exist as a fine aerosol and subsequent inhalation is linked to cancer. Tobacco root exudates enhance Cd uptake, even though the Cd concentration in NC soils is <0.1 mg/kg. Quantifying Cd concentrations in tobacco plants is crucial to understanding Cd bioavailability and implementing soil remediation efforts. The objective of this study was to develop a Cd mass balance for flue-cured tobacco grown under field conditions in NC. Whole plant samples were collected at transplanting and every 2 weeks thereafter until harvest. Individual plants were segregated into root, stalk and individual leaves (n = ~15 whole plants/sampling date; composite samples were taken early in the growing season). After recording dry mass, samples were analyzed using ion-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry or ion-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Lower leaves contained the highest Cd concentrations (~7-10 mg/kg). Leaves occupying the upper 50% of the plant had Cd concentrations of ~2 mg/kg. Uptake rate was greatest from day 27 to 66 (~21.5 µg Cd/day). Selective Cd uptake appears evident between day 27 and 43, but overall the relative rate of Cd uptake was similar to other trace metals and micronutrients. Cd distribution within the plants mirrored the distribution of calcium, a macronutrient. Of the 8 mg of soil extractable Cd (0.075 mg/kg) in the rooting zone, 15.0% (1203 µg) is removed by uptake. Of this 15%, 64.2% (772.2 µg) is exported at harvest, and 35.8% (430.8 µg; lower leaves, roots, stalks) is returned to the soil. This study must be replicated to account for seasonal and soil variations. These results do inform selection of tobacco strains that limit uptake of trace metals, particularly Cd.",

So, Temblor is intended to enable everyone in the United States, and eventually the world, to learn their seismic hazard, to determine what most ensures their safety, and to determine the risk reduction measures in their best financial interest. In our free web and mobile app, and Chrome extension for real estate websites, Temblor estimates the likelihood of seismic shaking from all quakes at their occurrence rates, and the consequences of the shaking for home damage. The app then shows how the damage or its costs could be decreased by buying or renting a seismically safer home, securing fragile objects inside your home, retrofitting an older home, or buying earthquake insurance.\nTemblor uses public data from the USGS in the U.S., SHARE in Europe, and the GEAR model (Bird et al, in press, BSSA) for the globe. Through publicly available modeling methods, the hazard data is combined with public data on homes (construction date and square footage) to make risk calculations. This means that Temblor’s results are independently reproducible. The app makes many simplifying assumptions, but users can provide additional information on their site and home for refined estimates. Temblor also lets one see active faults and recent quakes on the screen as they drive through an area.\nBecause fear tends to trigger either panic or denial, Temblor seeks to make the world of earthquakes more fascinating than frightening. We are neither scaring nor soothing people, but rather talking straight. Through maps, globes, push notifications, family connections, and costs and benefit estimates, Temblor emphasizes the personal, local, realtime, and most importantly, rational. Temblor’s goal is to distill scientific and engineering information into lucid, trusted, and ideally actionable guidance to renters, home owners, and home buyers, so that we all live more safely in earthquake country.",

            "abstract": "Safe air travel activity requires clean flight corridors. But particles scattered in the atmosphere, whether volcanic ash, dust or sand, may present a critical threat to aviation safety. When these foreign particles are ingested into jet engines, whose interiors (e.g., the combustor and turbine blades) reach 1200-2000 °C, they can abrade, melt, and stick to the internal components of the engine, clogging ventilation traps of the cooling system as well as imparting substantial damage and potentially resulting in catastrophic system failure. To date, no criterion predicts ash behaviour at high temperature. Here, we experimentally develop the first quantitative model to predict melting and sticking conditions for the compositional range of volcanic ash encountered worldwide (Fig.1). The assumption that volcanic ash can be approximated by sand or dust is wholly inadequate, leading to an overestimation of sticking temperature and a correspondingly severe underestimation of the thermal hazard. Our findings confirm that the melting/softening behaviour of volcanic ash at high temperatures is essentially controlled by the composition of erupted ash - which may serve as an accurate proxy of the thermal hazard potential of volcanic ash interaction with jet engines. The criterion proposed here successfully parameterizes the potentially complex “melting” process of volcanic ash and can be used to assess the deposition probability of volcanic ash upon ingestion into hot jet engines.",

            "abstract": "Temporal and spatial variability of precipitation in Southern Africa is particularly high. The associated drought and flood risks, combined with a largely rainfed agriculture, pose a challenge for water and food security in this region. It is thus important to understand both how climate variability affects agricultural productivity and how intra- and extra-regional trade can contribute to the region's capacity to deal with climate-related shocks. We combine international food trade data and a global hydrological model to quantify the water resources embedded in international food trade in southern Africa and with the rest of the world, from 1986-2011. We analyze the impacts of socio-economic, political and climatic changes on agricultural trade and embedded water resources during that period. We find that regional food trade is efficient in terms of water resources but may be unsustainable because water-productive exporters, like South Africa, rely on increasingly scarce water resources. The role of imports from the rest of the world in the region's food supply is important, in particular during severe droughts. This reflects how trade can efficiently redistribute water resources across continents in response to a sudden gap in food production and water productivity. As regional collaboration strengthens through the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and trade with other regions increases, our results point out opportunities for improved water-efficiency and sustainability of the region's food production via trade.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the magnetic properties of different terrestrial sediment fractions (sand, silt, and clay) from Iceland and Greenland as major sediment sources to the northern North Atlantic (NNA). Magnetic susceptibility (MS) and hysteresis data have previously shown to be strongly particle size dependent with silt (3-63µm) important for hosting the ferrimagnetic fraction and discriminating source. Here we expand upon these data with more fundamental observations including low temperature remanence, low and high temperature MS, and electron microscopy. All Iceland fractions lack a Verwey transition (Tv) and MS decreases gradually on heating between 100-500°C, consistent with (TM60) titanomagnetite. Frequency dependent MS (fd%; 1-998 Hz) of ~8% across all Iceland fractions implies significant SP grain populations within the average Day plot determined PSD grain size. Homogeneity in magnetic grain size across all Icelandic fractions implies a disconnect with physical grain size that is visualized in electron backscatter images as fine Fe-rich fragments are included within larger host grains. In contrast Greenlandic silt and sand possess a strong Tv and MS values that fall steeply between 560-580°C on heating, consistent with magnetite. Greenlandic ferrimagnetic fragments within the silt and sand size fractions exist as discrete particles and average magnetic grain size scales with physical grain size; the sand fraction is dominated by MD grains and silts are coarse PSD in size. While finer PSD clays are indistinguishable from all Iceland fractions on a Day plot SP contributions are lower and the Tv is more pronounced in Greenland clay. These new magnetic mineralogy, magnetic grain size, and electron microscopy measurements expand the differentiation of source and grain size of NNA source materials, and further highlight the necessity for grain-size specific magnetic measurements to isolate source from physical grain size variation in bulk marine sediment cores.",

Analysis of the meteorological station network shows that downslope windstorm events tend to be limited in spatial extent to the lee slope of the North South trending Sierra Nevada mountain range, and rarely extend to the Eastern half of the Owens Valley. Rotor events are shown to be characterized by particularly gusty winds. Model simulations, irrespective of boundary and surface layer parameterizations, are generally are not skillful in predicting the downstream extent of downslope windstorms. Re-forecasts of a large number of discrete windstorm events show that the percentage of correctly forecast events decreases with increasing forecast horizon, and the timing error and magnitude error of event-maximum wind speed increases with increasing forecast horizon. The quantitative error values derived here-in provide guidance regarding uncertainty and expected error of operational forecasts of topographically forced high wind events in the Owens Valley.",

            "abstract": "Global warming can potentially accelerate the decomposition of forest soil organic matter (SOM), as a source of greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the fate of forest SOM is important for evaluating and managing the global carbon cycle during climate change. Iron minerals play an important role in stabilizing organic carbon (OC) and regulating the biogeochemical cycle in the soil environment, but there is only limited information available concerning how iron-mediated OC stabilization is affected by physicochemical properties of soil. This study investigated the behavior of iron-bound OC in soils collected from 14 forests across the United States, and the impact of soil physicochemical properties on the stabilization of OC by iron minerals. The bicarbonate-citrate-dithionite (BCD) method was used to reduce iron in soil samples, and OC content was characterized prior and after reduction to quantify iron-bound OC. We found that iron-bound OC contributed 1.2 - 57.7 weight % of total OC in forest soils. Atomic ratios of iron-bound OC:Fe ranged from 0.006 to 0.178, indicating the importance of sorptive interactions. The fraction of iron-bound OC was more closely correlated to the molar ratio of iron-bound OC:Fe than the absolute concentration of reactive iron, which is ranged from 0.08 to 19.31 mg/g. Iron-bound OC was enriched in 13C compared to the non-iron-bound SOM. There were significant correlations between the total N concentration and total or non-iron bound OC, but not with iron-bound OC. Overall, iron minerals mainly stabilize 13C-enriched non-nitrogenous OC, which was almost regulated by the sorptive association between iron and OC. Our results illustrate the importance of understanding the stabilization of OC in soil, and the coupled biogeochemical processes of carbon and iron.",

            "abstract": "Extreme heat causes more human fatalities in the United States than any other natural disaster, elevating the concern of heat-related mortality. Maricopa County Arizona is known for its high heat index and its sprawling metropolitan complex which makes this region a perfect candidate for human health research. Individuals at higher risk are unequally spatially distributed, leaving the poor, homeless, non-native English speakers, elderly, and the socially isolated vulnerable to heat events. The Arizona Department of Health Services, Arizona State University and NASA DEVELOP LaRC are working to establish a more effective method of placing hydration and cooling centers in addition to enhancing the heat warning system to aid those with the highest exposure. Using NASA’s Earth Observation Systems from Aqua and Terra satellites, the daily spatial variability within the UHI was quantified over the summer heat seasons from 2005 – 2014, effectively establishing a remotely sensed surface temperature climatology for the county. A series of One-way Analysis of Variance revealed significant differences between daily surface temperature averages of the top 30% of census tracts within the study period. Furthermore, synoptic upper tropospheric circulation patterns were classified to relate surface weather types and heat index. The surface weather observation networks were also reviewed for analyzing the veracity of the other methods. The results provide detailed information regarding nuances within the UHI effect and will allow pertinent recommendations regarding the health department’s adaptive capacity. They also hold essential components for future policy decision-making regarding appropriate locations for cooling centers and efficient warning systems.",

            "abstract": "Sawtooth oscillations are one of several convection modes known to exist in the magnetosphere. Recent simulations have suggested that O\n+\nions transported from the high-latitude ionosphere to the magnetotail can drive sawtooth events. We present observational case studies of sawtooth events using data from FAST near the noon-midnight meridional plane, Cluster in the magnetotail, GOES and LANL energetic particle sensors at geosynchronous orbit, and ACE solar wind data to investigate the evolution of ion outflow during sawtooth events and the question of whether O\n+\noutflow from one tooth helps to drive subsequent teeth. We find that oxygen enters the tail from the lobes after each tooth onset, the oxygen fraction in the magnetotail often increases after a tooth onset, and that the oxygen fraction of outflowing ions increases after a tooth event both in the cusp and on the nightside. However, a significant amount of low energy oxygen (\n≲1\n~keV) can end up in the dayside inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Large thrust faults accommodate crustal shortening caused by the collision of tectonic plates, contributing to the growth of topography over geological timescales. The Himalayan belt, which results from the collision of India into Asia, has been the locus of some of the largest earthquakes to strike the continents, including the recent 2015 magnitude 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. Competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain how topography is sustained and how the current convergence across the Himalaya is accommodated – whether this is predominately along a single thrust or is more distributed, involving out-of-sequence additional faulting. Here we use geodetically-derived surface displacements to show that whilst the Gorkha earthquake was blind, it ruptured the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), highlighting its ramp-and-flat geometry. Reconciling independent geological, geomorphological, geophysical and geodetic observations, we quantify the geometry of the MHT in the Kathmandu area. Present-day convergence across the Himalaya is mostly accommodated along the MHT, and no out-of-sequence thrusting is required to explain the higher uplift and incision rates at the front of the high range. Whilst the vast majority of slip is buried at depth, triggered near surface slip was imaged in the Sentinel-1 coseismic interferograms along a 26 km long discontinuity, 10 km north of the Main Frontal Thrust. This surface break follows the trace of the Main Dun Thrust (MDT), a relatively minor splay. This displacement is seen to grow in the central portion of the splay in the proceeding week. Slip from the largest (Mw 7.3) aftershock that occurred 17 days later fills in most of the eastern gap in the slip contours of the mainshock at the lower edge of the fault rupture. In addition to the region west of the Gorkha rupture, a large portion of the MHT remains unbroken south of Kathmandu presenting a continuing seismic hazard. At the shallow end of the rupture, slip tapers off sharply and is markedly uniform along strike for the 140 km length rupture, and at a near constant depth of 11 km. Such a sharp limit on slip could result from the soleing out of other thrusts such as the MBT onto the MHT, resulting in structural complexity on the fault interface and a wide damage zone impeding up-dip rupture propagation, leaving a wide locked width at shallower depth.",

            "abstract": "A number of control parameters (i.e., strain rate, peak stress, number of load cycles) have been proposed to govern the formation of pulverized off-fault rocks (POFR) during earthquakes. Recent descriptions of fracture damage associated with high strain rate experiments on rock suggest that the portion of the work budget consumed in creating new fracture surfaces is fundamentally dependent on the loading rate. As POFR exhibit high fracture density, understanding this dependence is critical for constraining the processes responsible for their formation. The transition from weakly to highly fragmented (i.e., pulverized) is thought to be controlled by microcrack dynamics, which are sensitive to loading rate, but also material heterogeneity and pre-existing flaw distribution. Arkansas Novaculite is mineralogically homogeneous and nearly flaw free above the length scale of its sub-micron grain size, providing us with an ideal rock to evaluate continuum-based models of fragmentation. We have performed a series of dynamic compression tests on Arkansas Novaculite using a split-Hopkinson pressure bar. Our preliminary experimental results suggest that pulse shape and amplitude, both of which dictate the stress, strain rate, and total strain, exert a more fundamental control on the transition from localized fracture to pervasive fragmentation than any of these three latter parameters in isolation. Damage created across the transitional loading rate regime is characterized using BET surface area analysis, micro-CT scanning, and optical and scanning electron microscopy, and portions of the work budget partitioned to create new fracture surfaces are evaluated by measurements of fracture surface area on the post-mortem specimens. We show a dramatic increase in dynamic strength of Arkansas Novaculite, which highlights the importance of inherent flaws on the fragmentation process, consistent with the predictions of high strain rate fragmentation models.",

            "abstract": "Recent models indicate that due to climate change storm activity can intensify. Sea level rise as a result of climate change can lead to storm flooding and coastal damage in low-lying populated areas such as NE, USA. The New York metropolitan area experienced one of the highest storm surges in its history during Hurricane Sandy. The peak storm-tide elevation measured by USGS in Jamaica Bay was about 3.5 m, 1.4 m higher than historical measurements in the same area. As part of a National Science Foundation Rapid Response we surveyed from the R/V Pritchard and sampled the bays and inlets along the southern shore of Long Island after Super Storm Sandy in January 2013 and during June 2014 for assessing the impact of the storm.\nShort-lived radioisotopes, heavy metals and grain size variability were used to track the path of the storm. In 2013 high concentrations of metals (Pb 184 ppm) were deposited on the landward side of barrier islands and were tracked offshore for10 km. In 2014, we revisited the 2013 locations. The offshore, metal enriched mud layer was seen as small inclusions in sand and not present at the surface suggestive that natural processes are cleansing the sea-floor. Inland the cores showed three facies. From the base upwards: 1) coarse sand with low Pb 99 ppm. Interpreted as either sand transported landwards by the storm or in situ; 2) fine-grained, organic rich sediment with the high Pb 443 ppm and interpreted as seaward transport by the storm; 3) organic rich mud with lower Pb 200 ppm was found in the core tops. Most importantly the sea-floor was colonized by tubeworms suggestive that the environment is returning to normal conditions. These results coupled to other regional studies indicate that the storm was catastrophic and resulted in significant sediment transport. The surge brought sand inland modifying channel and inlet depths but most damaging was the seaward surge that brought contaminants offshore. It appears that the bays and inlets are resilient and returning to pre-storm conditions.",

The MJO significantly influences the occurrence of heavy precipitation around the globe. Since the MJO involves intense tropical convective heating anomalies, tropical–extratropical interactions are significant during its life cycle. Consequently, the MJO modulates the skill of weather forecasts in the medium and extended ranges.\nThis study investigates potential predictability of heavy precipitation over the United States during boreal winter using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF is configured with one grid (18 km horizontal grid spacing) over the contiguous United States. MJO events are identified with outgoing longwave radiation from polar orbiting satellites and zonal winds (850-hPa and 200-hPa) from NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) during 1979-2013. Ten MJO events in which heavy precipitation occurred over the western and eastern United States are selected to create a composite MJO event. Predictability experiments are conducted initializing WRF during the eight phases of the MJO life cycle. The presentation will discuss the importance of the MJO in modulating the precipitation variability over the United States and estimates of potential predictability of heavy precipitation.",

We show that mantle strain and surface strain-rate fields are consistent in the vicinity of San Andreas Fault (SAF) in California. Such an agreement suggests that the lithosphere and strong asthenosphere have been deformed coherently and steadily since >1 Ma. We find that the crustal stress field rotates (up to 40 degrees of rotation across a 50 km distance from 50 degrees relative to the strike of the SAF, in the near-field of SAF) from San Francisco to the Central Valley. Both observations suggest that the SAF extends to depth, likely through the entire lithosphere. From Central Valley towards the Basin and Range, the orientations of GPS strain-rates, shear wave splitting measurements and seismic stress fields diverge indicating reduced coupling or/and shallow crustal extension and/or presence of frozen anisotropy.",

In summer 2014 we constructed a system consisting of 11 Thorlabs APD120A2 avalanche photodiode modules, with bandwidths of 50 MHz (corresponding to about 10 ns 10-90% risetime to a step function of light) and an optical bandwidth from 200 nm to 1,000 nm with a peak response at 600 nm. Each of the 11 photodiodes observed different heights ranging from roughly 4 m to 115 m above the bottom of the triggered lightning channel. In summer 2015, we expanded the 2014 system to monitor altitudes ranging from roughly 4 m to about 1 km above the lightning channel bottom. The new system consists of 12 Thorlabs APD120A2 and 20 Thorlabs APD130A, both types having the same frequency response with a -3 dB high frequency cutoff around 50 MHz, but having different optical bandwidths, the latter photodiode from 400 nm to 1,000 nm with a peak response around 800 nm. All 32 photodiodes were mounted on a platform and positioned 293 m from the ICLRT rocket-launcher. The 32 channels are digitized at 100 MHz with time accuracy better than 10 ns. Here we show data from the 2014 system (see also Carvalho et al., 2014 and Carvalho et al., 2015 (under review)) and the first measurements of luminosity versus height to 1 km from the 2015 device. The first dataset measured with the 32-photodiode-system was acquired on July 19th, 2015 for an altitude-triggered flash. At the time of this Abstract submission, data have been acquired for 11 dart-leader/return stroke sequences in four 2015 triggered flashes, some containing M-components. We (1) show that different optical bandwidths produced different measured luminosity signal for the same triggered-lightning channel height, (2) measure the luminosity speed and other characteristics of return strokes and M-components, and (3) infer upward current speed for return strokes.",

(2015) during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E). With composite gridded NEXRAD radar reflectivity, four-dimensional (space-time) ice cloud microphysical properties of DCSs are retrieved, which is not possible from either in situ sampling at a single altitude or from vertical pointing radar measurements. For this study, aircraft in situ measurements provide the best-estimated ice cloud microphysical properties for validating the radar retrievals. Two statistical comparisons between retrieved and aircraft in situ measured ice microphysical properties are conducted from six selected cases during MC3E. For the temporal-averaged method, the averaged ice water content (IWC) and median mass diameter (Dm) from aircraft in situ measurements are 0.50 g m-3 and 1.51 mm, while the retrievals from radar reflectivity have negative biases of 0.12 g m-3 (24%) and 0.02 mm (1.3%) with correlations of 0.71 and 0.48, respectively. For the spatial-averaged method, the IWC retrievals are closer to the aircraft results (0.51 vs. 0.47 g m-3) with a positive bias of 8.5%, whereas the Dm retrievals are larger than the aircraft results (1.65 mm vs. 1.51 mm) with a positive bias of 9.3%. The retrieved IWCs decrease from ~0.6 g m-3 at 5 km to ~0.15 g m-3 at 13 km, and Dm values decrease from ~2 mm to ~0.7 mm at the same levels. In general, the aircraft in situ measured IWC and Dm values at each level are within one standard derivation of retrieved properties. Good agreements between microphysical properties measured from aircraft and retrieved from radar reflectivity measurements indicate the reasonable accuracy of our retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Natural hazards, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis, have been significant threats to humans throughout recorded history. The Global Positioning System satellites have become primary sensors to measure signatures associated with such natural hazards. These signatures typically include GPS-derived seismic deformation measurements, co-seismic vertical displacements, and real-time GPS-derived ocean buoy positioning estimates. Another way to use GPS observables is to compute the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) to measure and monitor post-seismic ionospheric disturbances caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.\nResearch at the University of New Brunswick (UNB) laid the foundations to model the three-dimensional ionosphere at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory by ingesting ground- and space-based GPS measurements into the state-of-the-art Global Assimilative Ionosphere Modeling (GAIM) software. As an outcome of the UNB and NASA research, new and innovative GPS applications have been invented including the use of ionospheric measurements to detect tiny fluctuations in the GPS signals between the spacecraft and GPS receivers caused by natural hazards occurring on or near the Earth’s surface.\nWe will show examples for early detection of natural hazards generated ionospheric signatures using ground-based and space-borne GPS receivers. We will also discuss recent results from the U.S. Real-time Earthquake Analysis for Disaster Mitigation Network (READI) exercises utilizing our algorithms. By studying the propagation properties of ionospheric perturbations generated by natural hazards along with applying sophisticated first-principles physics-based modeling, we are on track to develop new technologies that can potentially save human lives and minimize property damage. It is also expected that ionospheric monitoring of TEC perturbations might become an integral part of existing natural hazards warning systems.",

West of the town of Bolu - the NAF bifurcates into the northern and southern strands, which converge and are linked through the Mudurnu Valley, then diverge to border the Marmara Sea. The westward continuation of these two fault traces is marked by further complexities in potential active fault geometry, particularly in the Marmara Sea (northern strand), and the Biga Peninsula (southern strand). We evaluate potential active fault geometries for both strands by comparing stress models of various fault geometries in these regions to a record of focal mechanisms and inferred paleostress from a lineament analysis. For the Marmara region, two of the three possible geometries matched the maximum horizontal stress (σH) orientations determined from a record of focal mechanisms; however, only one represented the northern and southern sidewalls associated with the principal zone of deformation of the developing Marmara basin. This suggests that it is the most likely representation of the active through-going fault geometry in the region. In the Biga Peninsula region, the active geometry of the southern strand has the southern component approaching and intersecting the northern component through a linking feature in a narrow topographic valley. This geometry was selected over two others as it overlaps the σH orientation determined from focal mechanism data and a lineament analysis. Additionally, this geometry does not develop a prominent mis-oriented NE-SW stress feature observed in the model results of the other two geometries, otherwise absent in the focal mechanism data or inferred from a lineament analysis.",

However, how model performs in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is still not clear. The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) and GEOS-Chem are two global 3-D chemical transport models (CTMs) driven by assimilated meteorological observations. This study evaluates the simulations of CO during 2004–2012 in the UTLS region from these two models by using the latest version (V4.2) of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data. The spatial distributions, temporal variations and tape recorder of CO in the UTLS region are compared between model simulations and MLS observations. We also investigate the combined impacts of surface emission and deep convection on CO concentration in the UTLS over different regions using both model simulations and satellite observations. Results show that GMI and GEOS-Chem simulations of CO are similar in spatial distribution and magnitude. However, the CO peak values are smaller than MLS observations, with ~50% underestimation at 100 hPa. Besides, the seasonal cycles of CO in the UTLS are not well simulated over most regions where high CO centers are located above. The two models are capable to reproduce the emission-convection-CO relationships as observed by MLS over some regions at 215 hPa and 147 hPa.",

            "abstract": "Remotely-sensed land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable in energy balance and is widely used for estimating regional heat flux. However, the inequality between LST and aerodynamic surface temperature (Taero) poses a great challenge for regional heat flux estimation in one -source energy balance models. In this study, a one-source model for land (OSML) was proposed to estimate regional surface heat flux without a need for an empirical extra resistance. The proposed OSML employs both a conceptual VFC/LST trapezoid model and the electrical analogue formula of sensible heat flux (H) to estimate the radiometric-convective resistance (rae) by using a quartic equation. To evaluate the performance of OSML, the model was applied to the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX), using a remotely-sensed data set at a regional scale. Validated against tower observations, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of H and latent heat flux (LE) from OSML was 47 W/m2 and 51 W/m2, which is comparable to other published studies. OSML and SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) compared under the same available energy indicated that LE estimated by OSML is comparable to that derived from the SEBS model. In conducting further inter-comparisons of rae, the aerodynamic resistance derived from SEBS (ra_SEBS), and aerodynamic resistance (ra) derived from Brutsaert et al. (2005) in corn and soybean fields, we found that rae and ra_SEBS are comparable. Most importantly, our study indicates that the OSML method is applicable without having to acquire wind speed or to specify aerodynamic surface characteristics and that it is applicable to heterogeneous areas.",

            "abstract": "The longstanding problem of collisions in plasmas is a very fascinating and huge topic in plasma physics. The ‘natural’ operator that describes the Coulombian interactions between charged particles is the Landau (LAN) integral operator. The LAN operator is a nonlinear, integro-differential and Fokker-Planck type operator which satisfies the H theorem for the entropy growth. Due to its nonlinear nature and multi-dimensionality, any approach to the solution of the Landau integral is almost prohibitive. Therefore collisions are usually modeled by simplified collisional operators. Here collisional effects are modeled by i) the one-dimensional Lenard-Bernstein (LB) operator and ii) the three-dimensional Dougherty (DG) operator.\nIn the first case i), by focusing on a 1D-1V phase space, we study recurrence effects in a weakly collisional plasma, being collisions modeled by the LB operator. By decomposing the linear Vlasov-Poisson system in the Fourier-Hermite space, the recurrence problem is investigated in the linear regime of the damping of a Langmuir wave and of the onset of the bump-on-tail instability. The analysis is then confirmed and extended to the nonlinear regime through a Eulerian collisional Vlasov-Poisson code. Despite being routinely used, an artificial collisionality is not in general a viable way of preventing recurrence in numerical simulations. Moreover, recursive phenomena affect both the linear exponential growth and the nonlinear saturation of a linear instability by producing a fake growth in the electric field, thus showing that, although the filamentation is usually associated with low amplitude fluctuations contexts, it can occur also in nonlinear phenomena.\nOn the other hand ii), the effects of electron-electron collisions on the propagation of nonlinear electrostatic waves are shown by means of Eulerian simulations in a 1D-3V (one dimension in physical space, three dimensions in velocity space) phase space. The nonlinear regime of the symmetric bump-on-tail instability and the propagation of KEEN waves are discussed in detail. For both cases, it is shown how collisions work to destroy the phase space structures created by particle trapping effects and to damp the wave amplitude. Moreover, collisional effects are much stronger when the system exhibits nonlinear features.",

            "abstract": "Dusty-olivine chondrules are carriers of stable pre-accretionary remanence, and have recently been used to obtain the first reliable estimate of the magnetic field of the early solar nebula. Here we show how the magnetic architecture of a single dusty olivine grain from the Semarkona LL3.0 ordinary chondrite meteorite can be fully characterised in three-dimensions, using a combination of Focussed-Ion-Beam nanotomography (FIB-nt), electron tomography and finite-element micromagnetic modelling. We present a 3D volume reconstruction of a dusty olivine grain, obtained by selective milling through a region of interest in a series of sequential 20 nm slices, which are then imaged using scanning electron microscopy. The data provide a quantitative description of the iron particle ensemble, including the distribution of particle sizes, shapes, interparticle spacings and preferred orientations. Iron particles are predominantly oblate ellipoids. Particles nucleate on dislocation networks and are loosely arranged in a series of parallel sheets with their shortest dimension oriented normal to the sheets and their longest dimensions preferentially aligned within the sheets.\nIndividual particle geometries are converted to a finite-element mesh and used to perform micromagnetic simulations. The majority of particles adopt a single vortex state, with ‘bulk’ spins that rotate around a central vortex core. The results challenge pre-conceived ideas about the remanence carrying properties of vortex states. We find that remanence is carried by bulk spins rather than the vortex core. Although the orientation of the core is determined by the ellipsoidal geometry (parallel to the major axis for prolate ellipsoids; parallel to the minor axis for oblate ellipsoids), the remanence vectors generally lie at large angles (and in many cases antiparallel) to the core magnetisation. Even in the case of prolate particles, the resulting remanence vector can make a large angle of ~50° to the expected easy axis. The results reconcile the predicted and observed directions of remanence anisotropy, and demonstrate how this combination of nanotomography and micromagnetics will become an essential component of future single-crystal paleomagnetic studies.",

            "abstract": "Mountain waves are produced by flow over orography. They propagate almost vertically, and are characterized by nearly zero velocity phase speed. The altitude to which they typically propagate is not well documented. They are thought to mainly dissipate by absorption in a critical layer although large-amplitude wave breakdown is also thought to occur. There have been almost no direct observations of the breakdown of mountain waves in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The region over Cerro Pachon Chile (a 2715 meter mountain in the Andes where large astronomical telescopes are located) is especially favorable to the production of mountain waves. In 2009 Smith and colleagues reported on the first observations of such waves propagating into the mesopause region (85 to 95 km) from El Leoncito Argentina, where waves over Cerro Pachon could be seen using airglow observations. The Aerospace Corporation's Nightglow Imager (ANI) is located at the Andes Lidar Observatory near the crest of Cerro Pachon. ANI observes nighttime OH emission (near 1.6 microns) every 2 seconds over an approximate 73 degree field of view. ANI had previously been used to the breakdown of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability features not associated with a specific gravity wave. Here we present OH airglow observations, originating near 84 km, from 22 UT to 3 UT on 8/9 July 2012 that show the breakdown of a mountain wave into instability features that subsequently dissipate into turbulence. These multi-hour observations provide the most detailed images to date of the breakdown of a mountain wave. The causes for, and the results of, the breakdown of this mountain wave are discussed.",

Understanding the distribution and interplay of geologic processes is important for constraining models of its interior, surface-atmospheric interactions, and climate evolution. We focus on understanding the origin of the major geomorphological units identified by Lopes et al. (2010, 2015) [1,2], Malaska et al. (2015) [3] and regions we studied in Solomonidou et al. (2014; 2015) [4,5]. Here, we investigate the nature of: Undifferentiated Plains, Hummocky/Mountainous terrains, candidate cryovolcanic sites, Labyrinth, and Dunes in terms of surface albedo behavior and spectral evolution with time to identify possible changes. Using a radiative transfer code, we find that temporal variations of surface albedo occur for some areas. Tui Regio and Sotra Patera, both candidate cryovolcanic regions, change with time, becoming darker and brighter respectively in surface albedo. In contrast, we find that the Undifferentiated Plains and the suggested evaporitic areas [6] in the equatorial regions do not present any significant changes. We are able to report the differences and similarities among the various regions and provide constraints on their chemical composition and specific processes of origin. Our results support the hypothesis that both endogenic and exogenic processes have played important roles in shaping Titan’s geologic evolution. Such a variety of geologic processes and their relationship to the methane cycle make Titan important for astrobiology and habitability studies and particularly significant in solar system studies.\n[1] Lopes, R.M.C., et al.: Icarus, 205, 540-588, 2010; [2] Lopes, R.M.C., et al.: JGR, 118, 416-435, 2013; [3] Malaska, M., et al : Icarus, submitted, 2015;[4] Solomonidou et al.: JGR, 119, 1729-1747, 2014; [5] Solomonidou, A., et al.: In press, 2015; [6] Barnes, J., et al.: Planetary Science, 2,1, 2013.",

Studies that examine hydrologic recovery after wildfire typically have focused on short-term (1-2 years) effects on soil properties or vegetation regeneration. The long-term recovery of soil hydraulic properties, however, may also control enhanced surface runoff and flash flood generation, especially under extreme rainfall conditions. Knowledge of the evolution of soil hydraulic properties after wildfire is essential for improving conceptual and numerical models of infiltration and runoff generation. We summarize ongoing efforts using repeated field and laboratory measurements with tension infiltrometers to examine how infiltration properties, such as field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity, change as a function of burn severity and recovery time since wildfire disturbance. These results focus on mountainous, forested terrain in Colorado and New Mexico. We seek input from colleagues in the wildfire community regarding the duration and mechanisms of soil property recovery in other wildfire-prone landscapes to build a broader understanding.",

In this study, the effects of the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model parameters, forcing data, and initial conditions are analysed by using two GSA methods: Sobol’ and Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST). The simulations are carried out over five sub-basins within the Columbia River Basin (CRB) for three different periods: one-year, four-year, and seven-year. Four factors are considered and evaluated by using the two sensitivity analysis methods: the simulation length, parameter range, model initial conditions, and the reliability of the global sensitivity analysis methods. The reliability of the sensitivity analysis results is compared based on 1) the agreement between the two sensitivity analysis methods (Sobol’ and FAST) in terms of highlighting the same parameters or input as the most influential parameters or input and 2) how the methods are cohered in ranking these sensitive parameters under the same conditions (sub-basins and simulation length). The results show the coherence between the Sobol’ and FAST sensitivity analysis methods. Additionally, it is found that FAST method is sufficient to evaluate the main effects of the model parameters and inputs.

Abundant siderite should be expected in non-marine strata in which a reductant was present. The Triassic Shinarump Member (Chinle Fm) and Cretaceous Dakota Fm are fluvial and contain siderite in outcrops of floodplain mudstones. Siderite is present in cores of Dakota channel sandstones. Rinded and jointed iron-oxide concretions, Wonderstone patterns, and rhombic, iron-oxide pseudomorphs are present in outcrops of these sandstones. Vascular plants growing on floodplains provided the reductant. Similar concretions, patterns, and pseudomorphs are present in outcropping eolian cross-strata of the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone and in fluvial sandstone of the Cambrian Umm Ishrin Fm. Bleached sandstones indicate reductant was present in both units during late diagenesis. Because Jurassic deserts and Cambrian river systems lacked vascular plants, extra-formational methane was the likely reductant. We interpret the various iron-oxide-cemented phenomena of the Shinarump, Dakota, Navajo, and Umm Ishrin as products of siderite oxidation that accompanied exhumation.\nIn the Navajo, large concretions are enclosed in thick sheaths of iron-oxide cement. Through-going horizontal and vertical joints cut sheaths. Outside concretion sheaths, joints are unassociated with iron-oxide cements, but inside the sheaths, thick cement zones are present on both sides of (still-open) joints. Joints were conduits for oxidizing water entering the concretions. Redox gradients formed on both sides of joints and iron oxide accumulated as Fe+2 diffused from dissolving siderite toward joints and O2 diffused away from joints. Horizontal joints formed <100 m from the land surface. Iron-oxide accumulations on the horizontal joints and on the vertical joints that abut them (see figure) are evidence that siderite oxidation is ongoing and linked to exhumation.",

Prior studies of the Martian ionopause have lacked simultaneous comprehensive measurements of plasma and magnetic field properties. Therefore, we use MAVEN observations of the electron density, magnetic field, and ion and electron energy spectra to study the factors that influence properties of the ionopause. We present statistics on how the solar wind conditions and crustal field strength affect the presence or absence of an ionopause and its altitude, and consider how plasma and field properties change across the boundary. We find that, on average profiles with an ionopause are accompanied by a higher energy flux of protons at high altitudes and stronger magnetic field at low altitude than profiles without. At altitudes above ~300 km, the O+/O2+ ratio is significantly larger for profiles with an ionopause than those without an ionopause.

            "abstract": "Geoscientists and decision makers often use different words to describe the same thing. The American Geosciences Institute has developed a consistent definition for the geosciences (Wilson, 2014); however this definition often varies from how decision maker groups at the national, state, local, and regional levels often categorize geoscience topics. Where geoscientists may to refer to “geoscience,” decision makers may use terms like “energy,” “environment,” and “natural resources.” How may the geoscience community provide geoscience information to decision makers in a context they understand while at the same time providing a simple, yet consistent representation of all that the geosciences include?\nThe American Geoscience Institute’s (AGI’s) Critical Issues program’s main goal is to connect decision makers at all levels with decision-relevant, impartial, expert information from across the geosciences. The program uses a multi-faceted approach to reach different decision maker groups, including policy makers and government employees at the federal, state and local level. We discuss the challenges the Critical Issues program has overcome in representing the geosciences to decision makers in a cohesive fashion such that decision makers can access the information they need, while at the same time becoming aware of the breadth of information the geosciences has to offer, and the value of including geoscience in the decision-making process.\n",

            "abstract": "The heliopause is a pressure balanced structure that separates the inner and outer heliosheaths. The total pressure of the solar wind particles, including pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs), is approximately equal to the pressure of the interstellar gas and its magnetic field on the outer side. Should one of the pressures change, the heliosphere will shrink or expand in response, to compensate for the imbalance and reach a new equilibrium state. Based on Voyager 1 observations, some ACRs may have crossed the heliopause and escaped into the interstellar medium, providing a mechanism of energy transfer between the inner and outer heliosheaths that is not included in conventional MHD models. Here we evaluate the effect of ACR escape on the size and shape of the heliosphere using a simple model that includes an additional energy flux term across the heliopause. We show that this effect could be a possible explanation for the unexpectedly early heliopause encounter by Voyager 1.",

            "abstract": "Water management agencies rely on hydrologic forecasts issued by operational agencies such as NOAA’s Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC). The CBRFC has partnered with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) under funding from NASA to incorporate research-oriented, remotely-sensed snow data into CBRFC operations and to improve the accuracy of CBRFC forecasts. The partnership has yielded valuable analysis of snow surface albedo as represented in JPL’s MODIS Dust Radiative Forcing in Snow (MODDRFS) data, across the CBRFC’s area of responsibility.\nWhen dust layers within a snowpack emerge, reducing the snow surface albedo, the snowmelt rate may accelerate. The CBRFC operational snow model (SNOW17) is a temperature-index model that lacks explicit representation of snowpack surface albedo. CBRFC forecasters monitor MODDRFS data for emerging dust layers and may manually adjust SNOW17 melt rates. A technique was needed for efficient and objective incorporation of the MODDRFS data into SNOW17. Initial development focused in Colorado, where dust-on-snow events frequently occur. CBRFC forecasters used retrospective JPL-CBRFC analysis and developed a quantitative relationship between MODDRFS data and mean areal temperature (MAT) data. The relationship was used to generate adjusted, MODDRFS-informed input for SNOW17.\nImpacts of the MODDRFS-SNOW17 MAT adjustment method on snowmelt-driven streamflow prediction varied spatially and with characteristics of the dust deposition events. The largest improvements occurred in southwestern Colorado, in years with intense dust deposition events. Application of the method in other regions of Colorado and in “low dust” years resulted in minimal impact.\nThe MODDRFS-SNOW17 MAT technique will be implemented in CBRFC operations in late 2015, prior to spring 2016 runoff. Collaborative investigation of remote sensing-based adjustment methods for the CBRFC operational hydrologic forecasting environment will continue over the next several years.",

            "abstract": "Dhaka city, having a population of more than fifteen million, exclusively depends on groundwater as a source of quality drinking water. In recent decades the city is encountering groundwater diminution and the declining scenario is dissimilar in different parts of the city. This paper aims to discuss the groundwater depletion in different parts of Dhaka city from 1990 to 2012 along with the causes and consequences. Groundwater level data of different locations of Dhaka city were collected from Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). The data were processed and analyzed using SPSS and Excel Worksheet; a contour map was generated using ArcGIS 10.0 to outline the contemporary groundwater scenario of Dhaka city and the spatial analyst tool, Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) was used to prepare the map. In addition, experts’ opinions were collected using an in-depth interview strategy in order to provide a better understanding of the causes and consequences of groundwater depletion. The research results show that groundwater in Dhaka city is depleting at an alarming rate; the central part has the worst situation followed by the south-western part. In contrast, northern part has relatively better groundwater condition. Moreover, the peripheral zone exhibits a better condition because of the existence of rivers and wetlands. The interviews reveal that population density and overexploitation are mainly responsible for groundwater depletion; however, various other factors such as the deliberate establishment of deep tube wells, reduction of recharge capacity due to rapid growth of urban structures altogether results in huge drop of water level throughout the city. Rapid decline in groundwater augments the city’s exposure towards multiple risks including land subsidence, groundwater pollution and most importantly, paucity of available fresh water that might ultimately results into an urban disaster. Potential solutions to ameliorate this situation include urban greening, rainwater harvesting at household level, population management, awareness building etc. ",

            "abstract": "Land surface emissivity (LSE) in the thermal infrared depends mainly on the ground cover and on changes in soil moisture. The LSE is a critical variable that affects the prediction accuracy of geophysical models requiring land surface temperature as an input, highlighting the need for an accurate derivation of LSE. The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that diurnal changes in emissivity, as detected from space, are larger for areas mostly covered by biocrusts (composed mainly of cyanobacteria) than for bare sand areas. The LSE dynamics were monitored from geostationary orbit by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) over a sand dune field in a coastal desert region extending across both sides of the Israel–Egypt political borderline. Different land-use practices by the two countries have resulted in exposed, active sand dunes on the Egyptian side (Sinai), and dunes stabilized by biocrusts on the Israeli side (Negev). Since biocrusts adsorb more moisture from the atmosphere than bare sand does, and LSE is affected by the soil moisture, diurnal fluctuations in LSE were larger for the crusted dunes in the 8.7 μm channel. This phenomenon is attributed to water vapor adsorption by the sand / biocrust particles. The results indicate that LSE is sensitive to minor changes in soil water content caused by water vapor adsorption and can, therefore, serve as a tool for quantifying this effect, which has a large spatial impact. As biocrusts cover vast regions in deserts worldwide, this discovery has repercussions for LSE estimations in deserts around the globe, and these LSE variations can potentially have considerable effects on geophysical models from local to regional scales.",

            "abstract": "We present a statistical approach to establish correlations between locations with seismicity increase in Oklahoma and nearby well injection volumes. Seismicity rates in the state have significantly increased since approximately 2008. Fluid injection into deep wells has been theorized to be the cause of this seismicity, but the increase occurred significantly after the start of injection activities in the region. Further, injection-induced earthquakes depend on the presence and orientation of basement faults and the stress state in the region. Because of these complexities, it has been difficult to directly correlate fluid injection with seismicity. Here we show that a statistical correlation between increase in seismicity and injection volumes can be established in Oklahoma. We first employ a change point method to locate the regions where a change in seismicity rates has occurred. We then use a logistic regression model to relate the injection volumes in a region with the presence or absence of seismicity change in the region. This model is further used to evaluate the relative contribution of cumulative injection volumes and monthly injection rates to seismicity. The model can be used to identify “seismically sensitive regions” where seismicity increase has been observed with little fluid injection, and “seismically stable regions” where seismicity changes have not been observed even with high fluid injection. This information can be combined with geological information in a region, and used to make decisions about acceptable volumes for injection and to identify lower-risk regions for injection.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a technique to invert vertical sound speed profiles, like those obtained from reflection seismic data, for grain and pore fluid properties. We have applied this process to seismic data from the Bering Sea to better constrain gas and gas hydrate concentrations. The inversion is based on iterative forward modeling of the sediment constituents and pressure-temperature (PT) regime to match the observed sound speed profile. Inversion input can be either interval or stacking velocities, and we avoid the assumption that stacking velocities are the same as root mean square average velocities. We use a series of constituent sediment physics models whose inputs are mainly porosity, gas saturation, temperature, pressure, effective pressure and grain type (for calculation of effective elastic moduli). The value of this approach is that every model run in the forward algorithm is geologically consistent. Vast portions of model space are eliminated from searching because, e.g. gas hydrate cannot exist outside its PT stability zone.\nOf particular interest in the Bering Sea are large (~5 km wide) anomalies in seismic reflection profiles almost certainly associated with gas accumulation at the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS). We applied the inversion across one of these anomalies using stacking velocities from finely discretized semblance scans of seismic common midpoint gathers. Preliminary results suggest that little or no gas or gas hydrate need be present in areas away from the anomaly, in order to match the observed velocity profile. Directly over the center of the anomaly, the significantly reduced velocity below the BGHS requires at least 1-2% gas saturation, and the mildly elevated velocity above the BGHS requires 5-15% gas hydrate saturation.",

            "abstract": "Placing observational constraints on the spectrum of seismic-wavespeed fluctuations throughout Earth’s mantle improves our understanding of processes that generate, preserve, and destroy heterogeneity. Constraints on the heterogeneity spectrum from tomography have been limited to very large (>1000 km) length scales, but scattered energy in high-frequency waveforms suggests that significant structure exists at smaller scales (~10 km). Here we present constraints on intermediate-scale heterogeneity in the upper mantle from globally-averaged P-coda amplitudes. Using a particle-based “phonon” method to generate synthetics, we find that the heterogeneity power is inversely proportional to wavenumber at length scales between 5 and 500 km. The best-fitting r.m.s. velocity perturbation over this range of length scales is 6%, assuming that the heterogeneous layer is 600 km thick. Calculations using a spectral-element method verify this result for periods longer than 17 seconds.\nIt has been proposed that mantle convection produces strains that stretch, fold, and stir subducted lithosphere to smaller scales. To test if this process provides a viable explanation for the observed heterogeneity spectrum, we plan to simulate 5 billion years of heterogeneity production, subduction, and stirring. Using relationships from mineral physics, the final compositional field can be converted to a three-dimensional velocity model, for which synthetic seismograms can be computed and compared with actual data.",

            "abstract": "Photoactive roadways and the incorporation of diverse photocatalytic surfaces into the built environment have been proposed as a strategy to improve air quality in urban areas. Laboratory studies show that surfaces treated with TiO2 are efficient in removing nitrogen oxides (NOX). Nonetheless, measurements under ambient conditions capable of isolating the impact of the photoactive surface are scarce. Previous work by our group demonstrated that CO remains stable during the timescale where NOX removal is detected, and thus can be used as a tracer. The work presented herein focuses on outdoor tests comparing CO to NOX ratios (CO/NOX) before and after interacting with photoactive pavement materials. The samples were placed in a Teflon chamber receiving a controlled flow of ambient air supplemented with a constant addition of CO and NO calibration gases. Experiments started before sunrise and continued until sunset to understand the variation due to changing UV levels. CO and NOx were monitored at the input and output of the chamber; O3 was monitored at the input. Preliminary results with asphalt roadway samples indicate that while the input CO/NOX remains constant during the day, the output CO/NOX shows a maximum during early morning and subsequently decreases to a steady value throughout the afternoon. Our previous laboratory work indicates that NO2 removal by photoactive asphalt is smaller than that of NO. We hypothesize that the decrease in the CO/NOx ratio after early morning hours is caused by 1) the enhancement in O3 concentrations as the atmospheric photochemistry increases resulting in more NO2 entering the chamber and 2) NO2 released during photocatalytic NO removal process. Therefore, as the NO2/NO increases, the efficiency of photoactive process decreases indicating that the potential benefit from photoactive roads would likely be driven by a balance between UV levels and local photochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Historic arroyo entrenchment at the turn of the 20th century signified a rapid and widespread change in stream dynamics throughout much of the southwest U.S.A.. Arroyo walls along modern channels expose multiple unconformity-bound sediment packages that record mid-to-late Holocene arroyo cut-fill dynamics. Many of these different-aged periods of aggradation appear to have reached a similar tread height through time, suggesting that a 'geomorphic threshold' may partially control end-member stream grade and the timing of channel entrenchment. However, observations of near-synchronous regional cut-fill events support an alternative hypothesis that climate is a primary control of arroyo dynamics. In order to test the role of allogenic forcing versus autogenic processes on arroyo cut-fill dynamics, three datasets were constructed and analyzed from Johnson Wash (JW), a drainage containing a ~40 km long arroyo in the Grand Staircase region of the Colorado Plateau in south-central Utah. The chronostratigraphy of arroyo cut-fill events was reconstructed using a combination of field observations and age control from radiocarbon (n=57) and optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL; n=27) collected from 15 stratigraphic sections that bracket episodes of incision and characterize alluvial-fill packages. These data are compared to regional cut-fill chronologies from other arroyo systems. Temporal and spatial variability in catchment averaged erosion rates was quantified using terrestrial in-situ Beryllium-10 measured in quartz from alluvial and colluvial sediment samples (n=24) collected from the modern channel and paleo-arroyo walls located in JW and the adjacent upper Kanab Creek watershed. The third dataset consists of longitudinal profile concavities of the currently entrenched channel and the relict aggraded valley-fill surfaces and is used to identify systematic trends in aggraded versus entrenched channel forms.",

Globally, atmospheric CH4 concentrations have increased since direct measurements began, in the early 1980s, but then stabilized from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s. Since 2007, the atmospheric CH4 growth rate has become positive again causing concern that it may be the response to climate feedbacks, especially in the Arctic, where there is a potential for a large release of CH4 to the atmosphere under warmer conditions. Such feedbacks include high latitude wetlands, permafrost and the destabilization of methane hydrates.\nWe present CH4 emission estimates for the high northern latitudes (i.e., north of 50°N) from 2005 to 2012 using atmospheric mole fraction observations in a Bayesian inversion framework. This framework is based on the Lagrangian Particle Dispersion model, FLEXPART, run with ECMWF meteorological analyses. Emissions were optimized monthly and on a spatial grid of variable resolution. Background mixing ratios were found by coupling FLEXPART to output from the optimized Eulerian chemistry transport model, TM5. Meteorological models tend to overestimate the boundary layer heights (BLH) in the Arctic, especially in winter, which can lead to biases in the estimated fluxes. Therefore, we explored a number of data selection criteria to avoid assimilating data at times when significant errors in BLH were likely. Overall, the inversion found higher emissions in Northern Eurasia and North America compared to the prior in both summer and winter. The inversion fluxes also displayed considerable inter-annual variability, which appears to be related to climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Climate change, mainly caused by rising atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen (N) deposition due to human activities, is postulated to increase energy and nutrient inputs to soils that can accelerate or retard soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, a phenomenon called the priming effect. Yet, the direction and magnitude of priming in response to different amounts of energy and nutrient inputs remain elusive. Here we examined the effects of carbon (C) and N additions on priming, microbial turnover, extracellular enzyme activities, CO2 fluxes, and C accumulation in four different ecosystems. We applied low and high C (13C glucose; 350 and 1000 µg C g-1 wk-1) and C with N (NH4NO3; 35 and 100 µg N g-1 wk-1) for five weeks. We found: 1) high C and high C+N stimulated weekly priming in the first two weeks and then leveled off, indicating soil microorganisms may have a short-term of accelerated growth and activity but quickly adapt to frequent inputs of high substrate amounts, 2) high C induced greater cumulative priming, microbial turnover, and β-glucosidase activities than low C, 3) high C+N had significantly lower cumulative priming, turnover, and β-glucosidase activities than high C, 4) high C and high C+N stimulated greater CO2 fluxes and C accumulations than low substrate inputs. These results suggest that the amount of substrate (energy and nutrient) was a determinant factor in modulating the rate of SOM decomposition, microbial turnover, enzyme activities, and C balance. Overall we demonstrate that increased energy inputs can quickly accelerate SOM decomposition, but concurrent nutrient inputs can suppress such process, which could have a huge impact on terrestrial C storage and global biogeochemical C cycling under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Seacliff erosion is a serious hazard with implications for coastal management, and is often estimated using successive hand digitized cliff tops or bases (toe) to assess cliff retreat. We developed an automated procedure to extract the location of the cliff top from high resolution lidar-derived digital elevation models using transects generated at approximately 1-m intervals. The automated method to define cliff tops is repeatable, takes advantage of detailed topographic information within high-resolution elevation data, and is more efficient than hand-digitizing. To validate the results obtained from a 2010 aerial lidar survey, we conducted a terrestrial lidar (tlidar) survey at Bonny Doon beach near Santa Cruz California in 2014 and mapped the location of the cliff tops using real-time kinematic GPS. Bonny Doon beach has highly irregular cliffs, with several small sea caves and erosion features that were not distinguishable in the aerial lidar digital terrain model (DTM). We extracted the location of the cliff top from the tlidar point cloud along the same transects used previously to automatically derive cliff tops from the aerial lidar derived DTM. The minimum horizontal distance between the tlidar derived cliff top points and GPS points was calculated. The error measurements between GPS and terrestrial lidar are 0.19 m mean absolute error (MAE) and 0.51 m root mean square error (RMSE) respectively. The MAE and the RMSE between the GPS and aerial lidar cliff top points were 0.96 and 1.82 m respectively. The larger errors between aerial lidar cliff top points and GPS are likely due to the failure to remove all vegetation from the aerial lidar data, the positional accuracy of the aerial lidar, and a 4-year gap between surveys. The error assessment indicates that the automated procedure mapped the cliff top location successfully using both the aerial and terrestrial lidar, although the cliff top delineation based on the tlidar data was more accurate.",

The dancing sprite lasted only 60 ms, and the morphology consisted of three fields with two slim dim sprite elements in the first two fields and a very bright large sprite element in the third field, different from other observations. The bright sprite displaced at least 38 km from its parent flash and occurred over comparatively higher cloud top region. The parent flash was positive, with only one return stroke (~24 kA) and obvious continuing current process, and the charge moment change of the stroke was small (roughly the threshold for sprite production). All of the sprite elements occurred during the continuing current period, and the bright sprite induced considerable current. The sprite dancing features may be linked to parent storm electrical structure, dynamics and microphysics, and the parent CG discharge process which was consistent with VHF observations.",

The waves has been observed in Synthetic Aperture Radar data, and appear as solitary wave packets. They are also present in subsurface temperature records from the RAMA mooring s. In this work the waves are simulated by a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere prediction system, exchanging surface fluxes between the air and sea at high frequency and high resolution. The ocean model includes diurnal and semi-diurnal tides and has a 2 km resolution in the entire Bay of Bengal. In the model simulations, large amplitude semi-diurnal internal waves interact with the meso-scale circulation and modify the flow and the stratification as far away as Sri Lanka. By comparing model runs with tides and without tides, but forced by identical surface fluxes from the atmosphere, we find that the inclusion of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides act to cool the thermocline due to vertical mixing. This imply that non-linear semi-diurnal internal waves may significantly contribute to mixing in the interior of the Bay of Bengal.",

In thiswork, we formulate and solve a TCAT-based two-fluid-phase flow model. We detail the formulation of the model, which is a specific instancefrom a hierarchy of two-fluid-phase flow models that emerge from thetheory. We show the closure problem that must be solved. Using recentresults from high-resolution microscale simulations, we advance a set ofclosure relations that produce a closed model.

            "abstract": "Thanks to the introduction of the Spectral Element Method (SEM) in seismology, which allows accurate computation of the seismic wavefield in complex media, the resolution of regional and global tomographic models has improved in recent years.\nHowever, due to computational costs, only long period waveforms are considered, and only long wavelength structure can be constrained. Thus, the resulting 3D models are smooth, and only represent a small volumetric perturbation around a smooth reference model that does not include upper-mantle discontinuities (e.g. MLD, LAB). Extending the computations to shorter periods, necessary for the resolution of smaller scale features, is computationally challenging.\nIn order to overcome these limitations and to account for layered structure in the upper mantle in our full waveform tomography, we include information provided by short period seismic observables (receiver functions and surface wave dispersion), sensitive to sharp boundaries and anisotropic structure respectively.\nIn a first step, receiver functions and dispersion curves are used to generate a number of 1D radially anisotropic shear velocity profiles using a trans-dimensional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. These 1D profiles include both isotropic and anisotropic discontinuities in the upper mantle (above 300 km depth) beneath selected stationsand are then used to build a 3D starting model for the full waveform tomographic inversion. This model is built after 1) interpolation between the available 1D profiles, and 2) homogeneization of the layered 1D models to obtain an equivalent smooth 3D starting model in the period range of interest for waveform inversion. The waveforms used in the inversion are collected for paths contained in the region of study and filtered at periods longer than 40s. We use the spectral element code \"RegSEM\" (Cupillard et al., 2012) for forward computations and a quasi-Newton inversion approach in which kernels are computed using normal mode perturbation theory.\nWe present here the first reults of such an approach after successive iterations of a full waveform tomography of the North American continent.",

            "abstract": "Diagenetic records of fluid flow are underutilized proxies of water and environmental conditions in sedimentary rocks on Earth as well as Mars. The terrestrial iron-oxide records can be highly varied from faint wisps of coloration, to heavily cemented masses and layers. Other than vein cements, concretionary forms are some of the most prominent, yet enigmatic records. Concretions can have various mineral cement compositions with sizes that can span three orders of magnitude from mm, to cm, and m scales, in remarkably consistent, common spheroidal forms. Concretion geometries and banding may indicate directions and timings of fluid flow and precipitation, but deciphering the origins can be difficult with limited analytical tools. Definite complexities are the possibilities of: 1) overprinted events in an open system; 2) the role of organics in the nucleation and precipitation of authigenic minerals; and 3) multiple fluids, pathways, or processes that may produce similar-looking end products. In near-surface environments, likely any water since the Proterozoic has contained microbial life, and thus it seems highly probable that microbes play a significant role in the precipitation of diagenetic minerals due to the interactions of the biosphere and geosphere. However, recognition of ancient biosignatures that may have poor preservation potential remains a challenge.\nIron oxides are particularly common, valuable indicators of near-surface iron cycling and are recognizable because the visual coloration. Our recent studies in Jurassic sandstones indicate preserved records of fingering at the interface of two immiscible fluids. The integration of geochemical self-organization models and field data provides new insights to understanding diagenetic fluid compositions, their relative densities, and flow direction flux and movement. These studies can have valuable implications and applications for understanding past fluid flow history, and reservoir characterization for CO2, hydrocarbon, and water.",

            "abstract": "Sediment inputs to subduction zones impart a significant control on diagenetic reaction progress, fluid production and pore pressure development and thus affect hydrologic and tectonic behavior during subduction. Intensified glaciation following the mid-Pleistocene transition increased sediment flux to the Gulf of Alaska. Rapid sediment accumulation (>1 km/my) in the Aleutian Trench increases overburden and should accelerate dehydration of hydrous sedimentary components by elevating temperatures in the incoming sediment column. These processes have the potential to generate fluid overpressures in the mud-dominated, low permeability sediments deposited on the incoming plate, offshore SE Alaska. Mineralogical analyses on incoming sediments from Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 18 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 show that both smectite and Opal-A are present as hydrous mineral phases. A 1-D numerical model was developed to track dehydration reaction progress and pore pressures in the incoming sediment column from the abyssal plain to the Aleutian Trench. Simulated temperatures in the incoming column increase due to the insulating effect of trench sediments. As a result, trench sedimentation causes smectite dehydration to begin and Opal-A dehydration to nearly reach completion at the deformation front. Simulated excess pore pressures in the proto-decollement zone increase from nearly hydrostatic to almost half of lithostatic due to the rapid deposition of trench sediments. The 1-D modeling results were incorporated into a 2-D model that follows the underthrust column at the deformation front into the subduction zone. Simulated results of the 2-D flow model illustrate the effects of lateral flow on pore pressure distribution following subduction.",

            "abstract": "Climate and land use changes modify the physical functioning of river catchments and, in particular, influence the transport of nutrients from land to water. In large-scale catchments, where a variety of climates, topographies, soil types and land uses co-exist to form a highly heterogeneous environment, a more complex nutrient dynamic is imposed by climate and land use changes. This is the case of the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) that, along with the North Saskatchewan River, forms the largest river system in western Canada. In the past years changes in the land use and new industrial developments in the SSR area have heightened serious concerns about the future of water quality in the catchment and downstream waters. Agricultural activities have increased the supply of manure and fertilizer for cropping. Oil and gas exploitation has also increased the risk of surface water and groundwater contamination. The rapid population growth not only leads to increments in water consumption and wastewater, but in the construction of roads, railways and the expansion of new urban developments that impose hydraulic controls on the catchment hydrology and therefore the sediment and nutrient transport. Consequences of the actual anthropogenic changes have been notorious in reservoirs where algal blooms and signs of eutrophication have become common during certain times of the year. Although environmental agencies are constantly improving the mechanisms to reduce nutrient export into the river and ensure safe water quality standards, further research is needed in order to identify major nutrient sources and quantify nutrient export and also, to assess how nutrients are going to vary as a result of future climate and land use change scenarios.

            "abstract": "The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft entered orbit around Mars on September 21, 2014 and has since been detecting energetic oxygen pickup ions by its SEP (Solar Energetic Particles) and SWIA (Solar Wind Ion Analyzer) instruments. The oxygen pickup ions detected outside the Martian bowshock and in the upstream solar wind are associated with the extended hot oxygen exosphere of Mars, which is created mainly by the dissociative recombination of molecular oxygen ions with electrons in the ionosphere. We use analytic solutions to the equations of motion of pickup ions moving in the undisturbed upstream solar wind magnetic and motional electric fields and calculate the flux of oxygen pickup ions at the location of MAVEN. Our model calculates the ionization rate of oxygen atoms in the exosphere based on the hot oxygen densities predicted by Rahmati et al. (2014), and the sources of ionization include photo-ionization, charge exchange, and electron impact ionization. The photo-ionization frequency is calculated using the FISM (Flare Irradiance Spectral Model) solar flux model, based on MAVEN EUVM (Extreme Ultra-Violet Monitor) measurements. The frequency of charge exchange between a solar wind proton and an oxygen atom is calculated using MAVEN SWIA solar wind proton flux measurements, and the electron impact ionization frequency is calculated based on MAVEN SWEA (Solar Wind Electron Analyzer) solar wind electron flux measurements. The solar wind magnetic field used in the model is from the measurements taken by MAVEN MAG (magnetometer) in the upstream solar wind. The good agreement between our predicted pickup oxygen fluxes and the MAVEN SEP and SWIA measured ones confirms detection of oxygen pickup ions and these model-data comparisons can be used to constrain models of hot oxygen densities and photochemical escape flux.",

Based on the Leaf Collar Method, two key phenological phases, i.e., third leaf collar (TLC) and the maturity, are selected for NDVI modeling. The records on crop phenology were available from 1992 to 2013 at 103 stations in the Northeast China. However, there are large amount of missing data. Therefore, a statistic model is desirable to fill the gaps then, analyze the characteristics of the TLC and the maturity stage with the full data set. The Savitzky-Golay filter was used for noise reduction and temporal NDVI smoothing. The slope analysis was used for detection of TLC and maturity date of spring maize in the spring and in the fall, respectively. When NDVI slope values reach the turning point in certain period, the corresponding date is selected as TLC or maturity. Through comparison between observation and estimation, we find that 5-day slope method is robust to detect the changes of maize phenology. This study shows that the average estimation is 2 days earlier than observation. We then use this method to generate the TLC and mature dates for all the stations. The analyses of this full data set shows that the average TLC of spring maize in Northeast China emerges on Jun.2. The average maturity of spring maize appears on Sep. 18. The shortest growing season of 104 days appears in Jilin Province, while the longest growing season appears in Heilongjiang province of 116 days. When the latitude decreases, the annual average temperature and precipitation amount increases. Accordingly, TLC becomes earlier from Heilongjiang, Jilin to Liaoning Province. There is a significantly negative correlation between TLC that is around June and temperature of April and May. One-month time lags of climate factor, therefore, should be added to detection of phonological transitions of spring maize.",

            "abstract": "Channels regulate the sediment dynamics of tidal marshes, affect the capacity of marsh platforms to keep pace with sea level rise and can contribute to the loss of the low marsh, a critical area for nutrient cycling and ecosystem services. A puzzling aspect of marsh dynamics is the occurrence of slumping on the channel banks despite the absence of channel widening and migration. An apparently unrelated conundrum is why vertical accretion rates on the low marsh adjacent to channels are often higher than the rate of relative sea level rise: this sedimentation excess should not occur in a regime of equilibrium or in a regime of accelerated sea level rise. Here I suggest that bank erosion and sedimentation surplus are linked and can be explained by soil creep, the process by which soil is moved downslope by gravity. A novel model for a channel-platform cross section predicts an equilibrium state where the sedimentation surplus on the channel banks is transferred by creep toward the channel, where an erosional surplus and a suspend load transport toward the bank close the sediment budget. This model predicts that bank slumping can occur even if marshes are in equilibrium with sea level rise. As a consequence slumping is not an unequivocal indicator of ongoing marsh loss. The model also predicts that, at equilibrium, sedimentation rates adjacent to channels are higher than the rate of sea level rise. This implies that a sedimentation surplus is not a sign of resilience to sea level rise acceleration. The framework proposed by the model will affect how erosion and deposition measurements adjacent to marsh channels are interpreted.",

Hence, quantifying the driving processes shaping the evolution of topography in ancient and active orogens is required in order to disentangle the dynamic interactions and feedbacks among surface uplift, climate, erosion and sedimentation. The south central Andes of Argentina provide a particularly suitable setting to study the interplay between the tectonic and climatic evolution of an actively subduction orogen over short and long time-scales. We present δD values of soil-derived n-alkane and brGDGTs distributions to assess their suitability for paleoelevation reconstructions in the southern central Andes. We collected soil samples from two different environmental and hydrological gradients, across the hillslope (26-28°S) and along a river-valley (22-24°S) of two individual mountain ranges. δD n-alkane and brGDGTs distributions are both linearly related with elevation and may be used for paleoaltimetry studies along the windward flanks of the south central Andes. δD n-alkane and brGDGT-derived temperature lapse rates broadly follow regional lapse rates along steep orographic fronts. The observed lapse rates are lower than the annual mean values of satellite-derived temperatures but approach those of temperature loggers along each transect. Instead, δD n-alkane lapse rates are in line with regional stream-water data. These linear relationships along the windward slopes break down when entering the internally drained part of the Puna plateau. Our data document that δD n-alkane and brGDGTs distributions can be used over time scales relevant for paleoclimate/-altimetry reconstructions but also stress that such reconstructions require knowledge of the depositional environment.",

            "abstract": "A method to simulate the boundary layer of tropical cyclones in an idealized manner is described. The method can be used either with planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes or within large eddy simulations (LES). The key step is to include a term to the velocity equations representing the advection of angular momentum by the secondary circulation of a tropical cyclone. Using both single-column modeling and LES, model output is evaluated using dropsonde data and flight-level observations from tropical cyclones. Bulk properties of the flow (such as inflow-layer depths of ~1 km and surface inflow angles of ~25 degrees) compare well with observations only when the aforementioned mesoscale tendency terms are added; in contrast, traditional approaches without mesoscale tendency terms underestimate near-surface shear and overestimate boundary layer depth. Maximum effective eddy viscosity from LES is of-order 50 m2 s-1, consistent with recent observational studies. Analyses of temporal spectra demonstrate that the energetics of turbulence are captured well in LES, but only when grid spacing is approximately 10 m (or less). The method described here is proposed as an inexpensive way to evaluate boundary layer schemes for NWP models, and to generate realistic turbulence statistics for a variety of applications.",

            "abstract": "Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the structure and services of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones of the U.S., where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. Here we present the synthesis of 3 years of multidisciplinary work to quantify ecosystem shifts at the regional scale, along the entire Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, and transcribe these shifts into carbon (C) sequestration mass balances. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify shifts in areal coverage of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) over 20 years across the Texas Gulf coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area expanded by 74% (+16 km2). Concurrently, salt marsh area experienced a net loss of 24% (-78 km2). Most of that loss was due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise, with only 6% attributable to mangrove expansion. Although relative carbon load (per surface area) are statistically larger for mangrove wetlands, total C loads are larger for salt marsh wetlands due to their greater aerial coverage. The entire loss of above ground C (~7.0·109 g), was offset by salt marsh expansion (2.0·109 g) and mangrove expansion (5.6·109 g) over the study period. Concurrently, the net loss in salt marsh coverage led to a loss in below ground C accumulation capacity of 2.0·109 g/yr, whereas the net expansion of mangrove wetlands led to an added below ground C accumulation capacity of 0.4·109 g/yr. Biomarker data show that neutral carbohydrates and lignin contributed 30-70% and 10-40% of total C, respectively, in plant litter and surface sediments. Sharp declines of carbohydrate yields with depth occur parallel to increases in lignin degradation ratios, indicating substantial decomposition of both the polysaccharide and lignin components of litter detritus. Further, biomarker data suggest that litter chemistry is the primary control of C preservation in these wetland ecosystems. This study shows that shifts in plant composition influence C sequestration potential from landscape to molecular levels.",

Understanding the contribution of TCs to extreme sea levels is therefore essential. In this work we examine the contribution of TCs to annual maximum sea levels at the global scale, including potential climate controls and temporal changes.\nComplete global coverage (1842-2014) of historical 6-hour best track TC records are obtained from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) data set. Hourly tide gauge data are obtained from the Joint Archive for Sea Level Research Quality Data Set. There are 177 tide gauge stations with at least 25 complete years of data between 1970 and 2014 (a complete year is defined as having more than 90% of all the hourly measurements in a year). We associate an annual maximum sea level at a given station with a TC if the center of circulation of the storm passed within a certain distance from the station within a given time window. Spatial and temporal sensitivity analyses are performed with varying time windows (6h, 12h) and buffer zones (200km and 500km) around the tide gauge stations.\nResults highlight large regional differences, with some locations experiencing almost ¾ of their annual maxima during the passage of a TC. The attribution of annual maximum sea level to TCs is particularly high along the coastal areas of the eastern United States, the Gulf of Mexico, China, Japan, Taiwan and Western Australia. Further analyses will examine the role played by El Niño – Southern Oscillation and the potential temporal changes in TC contributions to annual maximum sea levels.",

Seventy-six Iñupiat elders, hunters, and other knowledge-holders from the North Slope villages of Barrow, Atqasuk, Wainwright, Nuiqsut, and Anaktuvuk Pass were interviewed, and over 75 hours of videotaped interviews were produced. The interviews provided information and observations on landforms, lakes, erosion, permafrost degradation and thermokarst, changes in the environment and in animal behavior, human modification of lakes, tundra damage from 4-wheel off-road vehicles, tundra trail expansion, and other phenomena. Community concerns regarding the impact of environmental change on food procurement, animal migration, human travel routes, and the future of subsistence practices were also prominent themes. Following an interview, each videotaped session was logged. Each time an elder pointed to a location on a map and explained a landscape event/observation or told a story, the time‐stamp in the video was recorded. Each logged event consisted of a code and a short account of the observation. From these reference sheets, a Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset was created. A logged account for each videotape, with geographic coordinates, event code, and event description is available for each videotape. The goal of the workshop was to report on our findings, thank the community for their support, and collaboratively develop plans for archiving and disseminating this data. A complete video library and searchable, printed and digital issues of the logging dataset for archiving in the communities were also produced. Discussions with administrative personnel at the Tuzzy Library in Barrow and the Inupiat Heritage Center have enabled us to set standards and develop a timeline for turning over the library of videos and GIS data to the North Slope community.",

            "abstract": "Both paleomagnetic and GPS observations document clockwise rotation of the forearc and backarc of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ). The similarity in observations for the long-term (since middle Miocene) geologic record and present-day GPS measurements raises the question to what extent is the paleoseismic record of Holocene crustal deformation in the forearc and backarc consistent with clockwise rotation? Because paleoseismic investigations typically target sites of identifiable ground deformation or subsidence in the Holocene (100-10,000 years before present), these studies only provide an incomplete window into the pattern of near-surface crustal strain that may be more apparent over a longer time scale. I provide an overview of the pattern of strain available from paleoseismic studies of the forearc and backarc of Cascadia. Conclusions are that near the coast where the crust predominantly responds to accumulation and release of strain on the megathrust, the proximal subduction zone signal is well defined within the paleoseismic history of earthquakes over many cycles. However, paleoseismic data do not entirely clarify whether Holocene deformation in the forearc and backarc of the CSZ is consistent with clockwise rotation of the forearc and backarc. Most of the individual faults that have ruptured Earth's surface in the Holocene are consistent with clockwise rotation; and the general pattern of north-directed compression in both the forearc and backarc is, again, not inconsistent with secular clockwise rotation. But the paleoseismic record of near surface deformation is consistent with clockwise rotation only by recognizing that other important tectonic variables may account for the pattern of individual fault ruptures. These contributing factors include inherited (i.e. predate plate-margin-induced clockwise rotation) zones of structural weakness in rocks, inherited crustal-scale structures such as basins or long standing structural highs and partitioning of strain on preexisting faults.",

One of the studies focused on attribution of extreme heat in relation to vulnerable populations in California’s Central Valley, where heat waves have become progressively more severe due to increasing nighttime temperatures. Specifically, we found that that (1) simulations of the hottest summer days during the 2000s were twice as likely to occur using observed levels of greenhouse gases than in a counterfactual world without major human activities, (2) detrimental impacts of heat on public health-relevant variables, such as the number of days above 40°C, can be quantified and attributed to human activities using PEA, and (3) PEA can serve as a tool for addressing climate justice concerns of populations within developed nations. The research conducted through the PACE program has also provided a framework for a pioneering climate attribution study at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). The UCS project takes advantage of new research that shows that nearly two-thirds of carbon pollution released into the atmosphere, reported as carbon dioxide equivalent with hundred-year global warming potentials, can be traced to carbon extracted from the Earth by a subset of producers of coal, oil, natural gas, and cement manufacturers. The approach for this study is to use superensembles of regional model simulations to explore the specific fractional attribution to emissions traceable to 90 major industrial carbon producers.",

            "abstract": "Faced with unprecedented growth in the Big Data domain of climate science, NASA has developed the Climate Data Analytic Services (CDAS) framework. This framework enables scientists to execute trusted and tested analysis operations in a high performance environment close to the massive data stores at NASA. The data is accessed in standard (NetCDF, HDF, etc.) formats in a POSIX file system and processed using trusted climate data analysis tools (ESMF, CDAT, NCO, etc.). The framework is structured as a set of interacting modules allowing maximal flexibility in deployment choices. The current set of module managers include:\nStaging Manager: Runs the computation locally on the WPS server or remotely using tools such as celery or SLURM.\nCompute Engine Manager: Runs the computation serially or distributed over nodes using a parallelization framework such as celery or spark.\nDecomposition Manger: Manages strategies for distributing the data over nodes.\nData Manager: Handles the import of domain data from long term storage and manages the in-memory and disk-based caching architectures.\nKernel manager: A kernel is an encapsulated computational unit which executes a processor’s compute task. Each kernel is implemented in python exploiting existing analysis packages (e.g. CDAT) and is compatible with all CDAS compute engines and decompositions.\nCDAS services are accessed via a WPS API being developed in collaboration with the ESGF Compute Working Team to support server-side analytics for ESGF. The API can be executed using either direct web service calls, a python script or application, or a javascript-based web application. Client packages in python or javascript contain everything needed to make CDAS requests.\nThe CDAS architecture brings together the tools, data storage, and high-performance computing required for timely analysis of large-scale data sets, where the data resides, to ultimately produce societal benefits. It is is currently deployed at NASA in support of the Collaborative REAnalysis Technical Environment (CREATE) project, which centralizes numerous global reanalysis datasets onto a single advanced data analytics platform. This service permits decision makers to investigate climate changes around the globe, inspect model trends, compare multiple reanalysis datasets, and variability.",

Towards this end, of particular interest, and showing great potential are communities of practice. Communities of practice represent relationships in real-time between and among people sharing a common practice. They facilitate the sharing of information, building collective knowledge, and growing of the principles of practice. In 2010-11, SMD EPO established a website to support EPO professionals, facilitate headquarters reporting, and foster a community of practice. The purpose of this evaluation is to examine the design and use of the workspace and the value created for both individual community members and SMD EPO, the sponsoring organization.\nThe online workspace was launched in 2010-11 for the members of NASA’s SMDEPO community. The online workspace was designed to help facilitate the efficient sharing of information, be a central repository for resources, help facilitate and support knowledge creation, and ultimately lead to the development of an online community of practice. This study examines the role of the online workspace component of a community in the work of a community of practice. Much has been studied revealing the importance of communities of practice to organizations, project success, and knowledge management and some of these same successes hold true for virtual communities of practice. Additionally, we look at the outcomes of housting the online community for these past years in respect to knowledge building and personal and organizational value, the affects on professional dvelopment opportunities, how community members have benefited, and how the workspace has evolved to better serve the community.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale eddies are an important component in Arctic Ocean dynamics and can play a role in vertical redistribution of ocean heat from the intermediate layer of warm Atlantic Water (AW). We analyze mooring data collected along the continental slope of the Laptev Sea in 2007-11 to improve the characterization of Arctic mesoscale eddies in this region of the Eurasian Basin (EB).\nWavelet analyses suggest that ~20% of the mooring record is occupied by mesoscale eddies, whose vertical scales can be large, often >600 m. Based on similarity between temperature/salinity profiles measured inside eddies and modern climatology for the 2000s, we found two distinct sources of eddy formation in the EB; one in the vicinity of Fram Strait and the other at the continental slope of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago. Both sources of eddies are on the route of AW propagation along the EB margins, so that the Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current (ACBC) can carry these eddies along the continental slope.\nThe lateral advection of waters isolated inside the eddy cores by ACBC affect the heat and salt balance of the eastern EB. The average temperature anomaly inside Fram Strait eddies in the layer above the AW temperature core (i.e., above 350 m depth level) was ~0.1º C with the strongest temperature anomaly in this layer exceeding 0.5ºC. In contrast to Fram Strait eddies, Severnaya Zemlya eddies carry anomalously cold and fresh water, and likely contribute to ventilation of the AW core. In addition, we found increased vertical shears of the horizontal velocities inside eddies that result in enhanced mixing. Our estimates made using the Pacanowski and Philander (1981) relationship suggest that, on average, vertical diffusivity coefficients inside eddies are four times larger than those in the surrounding waters. We will use the high resolution ECCO model to investigate the relative contributions of along and across slope transports induced by eddies along the ACBC path.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of long-lived greenhouse gases in the urban atmosphere are potentially useful to constrain and validate urban emission inventories, or space-borne remote-sensing products. We summarize and compare three different approaches, operating at different scales, that directly or indirectly identify, attribute and quantify emissions (and uptake) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in urban environments. All three approaches are illustrated using in-situ measurements in the atmosphere in and over Vancouver, Canada.\nMobile sensing may be a promising way to quantify and map CO2 mixing ratios at fine scales across heterogenous and complex urban environments. We developed a system for monitoring CO2 mixing ratios at street level using a network of mobile CO2 sensors deployable on vehicles and bikes. A total of 5 prototype sensors were built and simultaneously used in a measurement campaign across a range of urban land use types and densities within a short time frame (3 hours). The dataset is used to aid in fine scale emission mapping in combination with simultaneous tower-based flux measurements. Overall, calculated CO2 emissions are realistic when compared against a spatially disaggregated scale emission inventory.\nThe second approach is based on mass flux measurements of CO2 using a tower-based eddy covariance (EC) system. We present a continuous 7-year long dataset of CO2 fluxes measured by EC at the 28m tall flux tower ‘Vancouver-Sunset’. We show how this dataset can be combined with turbulent source area models to quantify and partition different emission processes at the neighborhood-scale. The long-term EC measurements are within 10% of a spatially disaggregated scale emission inventory.\nThirdly, at the urban scale, we present a dataset of CO2 mixing ratios measured using a tethered balloon system in the urban boundary layer above Vancouver. Using a simple box model, net city-scale CO2 emissions can be determined using measured rate of change of CO2 mixing ratios, estimated CO2 advection and entrainment fluxes. Daily city-scale emissions totals predicted by the model are within 32% of a spatially scaled municipal greenhouse gas inventory.\nIn summary, combining information from different approaches and scales is a promising approach to establish long-term emission monitoring networks in cities.",

The present study aimed to investigate the climatic, terrestrial, and anthropogenic factors that influenced the decadal pattern in Hg wet deposition in upstate NY. In spring and summer, when Hg wet deposition was the strongest, significant positive correlation (r2 = 0.89, p < 0.0001 in spring; r2 = 0.58, p = 0.002 in summer) of Hg wet deposition with precipitation was found. Increases in precipitation during these seasons could offset the decreasing of Hg concentration in precipitation. Besides, springtime positive correlation (r2 = 0.35, p = 0.02) between precipitation and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index together with geopotential height and wind speed analysis indicated that large-scale dynamical forcing was likely an important factor influencing the long term trend in springtime Hg wet deposition at HWF. To further quantify the roles of meteorological and anthropogenic factors in Hg wet deposition, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was employed using an algorithm depicting state-of-the-art Hg chemistry mechanism and up-to-date Hg emission inventories evaluated with MDN and Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) measurement data. CMAQ simulations with a constant vs. realistic meteorological conditions for multiple warm seasons (including spring and summer) were used to characterize and quantify the impacts of inter-annual variability of precipitation and atmospheric circulation on Hg wet deposition. In addition, contributions to Hg wet deposition from decreases in anthropogenic emissions in NYS and nation-wide were quantified from the model results.",

            "abstract": "Radiative kernel method has been validated and widely used in the study of climate feedbacks. This study uses spectrally resolved longwave radiative kernels to examine the short-term water vapor feedbacks associated with the ENSO cycles. Using a 500-year GFDL CM3 and a 100-year NCAR CCSM4 pre-industry control simulation, we have constructed two sets of longwave spectral radiative kernels. We then composite El Niño, La Niña and ENSO-neutral states and estimate the water vapor feedbacks associated with the El Niño and La Niña phases of ENSO cycles in both simulations. Similar analysis is also applied to 35-year (1979-2014) ECMWF ERA-interim reanalysis data, which is deemed as observational results here. When modeled and observed broadband feedbacks are compared to each other, they show similar geographic patterns but with noticeable discrepancies in the contrast between the tropics and extra-tropics. Especially, in El Niño phase, the feedback estimated from reanalysis is much greater than those from the model simulations. Considering the observational data span, we carry out a sensitivity test to explore the variability of feedback-deriving using 35-year data. To do so, we calculate the water vapor feedback within every 35-year segment of the GFDL CM3 control run by two methods: one is to composite El Nino or La Nina phases as mentioned above and the other is to regressing the TOA flux perturbation caused by water vapor change (δR_H­2O) against the global-mean surface temperature a­­­­nomaly. We find that the short-term feedback strengths derived from composite method can change considerably from one segment to another segment, while the feedbacks by regression method are less sensitive to the choice of segment and their strengths are also much smaller than those from composite analysis. This study suggests that caution is warranted in order to infer long-term feedbacks from a few decades of observations. When spectral details of the global-mean feedbacks are examined, more inconsistencies can be revealed in many spectral bands, especially H2O continuum absorption bands and window regions. These discrepancies can be attributed back to differences in observed and modeled water vapor profiles in responses to tropical SST.",

            "abstract": "Future projections of the extremes have been mostly assessed using output of general circulation models (GCMs), and most of the conclusions on precipitation extremes have been based on daily averages. The robustness of most GCM simulations is limited by the daily scale, because the convective cloud systems are not explicitly resolved and the diurnal cycle of precipitation is generally not well simulated by the GCMs. However, both temperature and precipitation are modulated by diurnal cycles, and heavy precipitations are commonly related to mesoscale systems which have life time less than a day.\nIn this study, super-parameterization (SP) was applied to enhance the performance of Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) at mesoscale and sub-daily scales. Unlike the conventional GCMs, the SP version employs an embedded cloud resolving model on each model grid. It provides us an opportunity to assess the sub-daily extremes on the global scale. Two 10-years simulations were performed using the present sea-surface temperature (SST) and perturbed SST in RCP8.5 scenario respectively. In addition, the simulations were repeated using the traditional CAM for comparison. SP-CAM simulates more reasonable diurnal cycles and closer match of heavy precipitations to observations than CAM in present climate. Moderate precipitation extremes are defined by the 99th percentile of the 3-hourly precipitation rate. The changes in sub-daily precipitation extremes agree with that of daily extremes in terms of trends both globally and regionally. But the sub-daily extremes have larger changes than daily extremes in general, since the dynamic and thermodynamic factors have different impacts on the precipitation with different intensities. The change of SPCAM sub-daily precipitation extreme is 6.2%/K on the global scale and can be quite different regionally. Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation, although is instructive on global scale, does not predict the exact change of precipitation extremes regionally, since it is only based on thermodynamics.",

Filter sample media included Teflon® membrane and quartz fiber filters for chemical analysis (71 species), and Nuclepore® filters for individual particle analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The < 38 µm sieved fractions were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction for their mineral content while the > 38 µm, < 125 µm soil fractions were mineralogically characterized by optical microscopy.\nWe will be presenting results on the optical measurements, also showing the relationship between single scattering albedo (SSA) at three different wavelengths, and chemical as well as mineralogical content and interdependencies of the entrained dust samples. Examples showing the relationships between the single scattering albedos of airborne dusts, and iron (Fe) in hematite, goethite, and clay minerals (montmorillonite, illite, palygorskite), will be discussed.\nOur goal is to establish a database of the optical, mineralogical, and chemical properties of dust samples collected at multiple global dust sources. These data can be for applications in climate modeling, remote sensing, visibility, health (medical geology), ocean fertilization, and damage to equipment.",

            "abstract": "“SNAP!, CRACK!, POP!” The sounds reverberated across newly shaded permafrost of unusual talus aprons (Ford & Andersen, 1967; J. Geol., 75, 722-732) of interior Antarctica (lats. >84°S; Thiel, Pensacola mtns.), coming from ice cracking under tensile failure (cryoseisms). Apron regoliths show conspicuously reversed downslope particle-size sorting and downslope-oriented lineations (debris-cleared tracts; stone stripes) formed by vibrational movement of detritus by midsummer, diurnal cracking of ice. Moving laterally by vibrations away from cracks, with downslope component by gravity, finer detritus becomes concentrated downslope from coarser debris of initial cliff fall — winnowed, as if on a gigantic vibrating shaking table. Slopes outside shade zones remain free of cracking. Diurnal midday shading of solar-warmed, debris-mantled permafrost- and glacier-surface ice at low ambient midsummer temperatures produces high strain-loading rates that exceed tensile toughness of inhomogeneous, polycrystalline ice containing zones of older but sealed cracks.\nThis dry, mechanical, cryoseism mechanism is here proposed also for now waterless Mars and other icy Solar System bodies. Regolith features of Mars’ cryosphere may appear different from anrarctic analogues owing to likely operation over tens if not hundreds of millions of years longer than on Earth. The strain distributions in tensile failure of ice better explain a common spacing uniformity of many martian linear features than others’ proposed origins, and for some “active” streaks and gully channels, TARS, RSL and dune-slipface channels, as well as for dune orthogonality, diurnal moonquakes and asteroid-regolith detrital sorting (e.g., “rubble-pile” 25143-Itokawa). Because periodic shade from topography (canyons, craters, etc.) is needed, the mechanism is not expected on flattish terrains where more normal annual cooling rates produce the common polygonal tensile fracturing of ice",

            "abstract": "One of the key challenges of curating environmental data is the need for trustworthy quality assurance. Researchers and other data users need to be reasonably confident that the condition of the data is suitable for their specific uses and that the data is accurately reflected by its metadata. The IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) maintains a large and expanding archive of seismic data, for which the task of quality assurance is complex and evolving. To that end, IRIS has recently completed its introduction of MUSTANG, a service oriented infrastructure for seismic data quality assessment. MUSTANG provides approximately 50 quality-related metrics and Power Spectral Density measurements freely accessible to the research community through web service interfaces. We are in the process of consistently applying these measurements across our entire archive for all past and current seismic time series data and implementing algorithms to update these measurements in response to metadata or data changes.\nIn this presentation we will show how value added to data archived at the IRIS DMC by MUSTANG data quality metrics is providing incentive for seismic network operators to share data across regional and geopolitical borders. In a 2014 Data Management Workshop in Bogotá, Colombia, 32 regional seismic networks in Latin America chose to share data from their networks for a one year period so that data quality metrics could be calculated, that will result in a paper coauthored by all participants. In addition, the MUSTANG metrics for these networks are reviewed by a DMC analyst and summarized in monthly network quality reports that can be used to improve future data quality. As a result, more than 400 permanent stations from the region are becoming openly available. We will also present another feature of the MUSTANG system, namely its ability to incorporate data quality metrics from other Data Centers, thereby enhancing quality assurance cooperation throughout the earth science community.",

(2014), we present the solution of the Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons and their energy interplay in the magnetosphere and two conjugated ionospheres. In this investigation superthermal electron activity along the magnetic field lines that lie at a distance of 4.6 and 6.8 Earth radii from the Earth’s equator was considered. The major focus of this presentation is to study how both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves (ECH) and upper bounded chorus (UBC) and lower bounded chorus (LBC) whistler mode waves influence the superthermal electron directional fluxes and their pitch-angle distributions in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. This is achieved by numerically solving the Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation with ECH, LBC, and UBC wave activity taken into account and comparing the results to the solution of the Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation when only the influence of coulomb collisions is considered. We also discuss how the wave-particle interaction processes contribute to the energy balance of thermal and superthermal plasmas in the ionosphere-magnetosphere system.",

TEC values corresponding to mid-latitude MSTIDs, also named electro-buoyance waves, map into the opposite hemisphere to ~10% of their original amplitude. Equatorial plasma bubbles sometime reach mid latitudes showing 100% conjugacy in both hemispheres. During disturbed conditions, we have observed MSTIDs, or plasma structures occurring over the Continental USA reaching latitudes that are commonly considered sub-auroral regions. We believe that the latter structures likely follow the Perkins instability and may be driven by a southward wind associated with the disturbed dynamo. We will also show data collected with satellites (CNOFS/DMSP/SWARM) passing over the southern hemisphere to diagnose the conjugacy of these structures.

            "abstract": "Rising seas are expected to have significant impacts on infrastructure and natural and cultural resources on New Hampshire’s 18 mile open-ocean coastline and 235 miles of tidal shoreline. However, most coastal municipalities in NH lack financial and human resources to even assess vulnerability, let alone plan for climate change. This gap has been filled since 2010 by the NH Coastal Adaptation Workgroup (CAW), composed of 21 regional, state, and federal agencies, businesses, municipalities, academics, and NGOs that bring together stakeholders to discuss climate change challenges and collaboratively develop and implement effective coastal adaptation strategies. Our grassroot efforts serve to nurture existing and build new relationships, disseminate coastal watershed climate assessments, and tap into state, federal, and foundation funds for specific coastal adaptation projects. CAW has achieved collective impact in by connecting federal and state resources to communities by raising money and facilitating projects, translating climate science, educating community members, providing direct technical assistance and general capacity, and sharing success stories and lessons learned. Indicators of success include: 12 coastal communities improved their technical, financial, and human resources for climate adaptation; 80% of the 300 participants in the eleven CAW ‘Water, Weather, Climate, and Community Workshops’ have increased knowledge, motivation, and capacity to address climate adaptation; $3 million in grants to help communities with climate adaptation; winner of the 2015 EPA Region 1 Environmental Merit Award; and ongoing support for community-led adaptation efforts. In addition, the NH Climate Summit attracts over 100 participants each year, over 90% whom attest to the applicability of what they learn there. CAW also plays a central role in the Coastal Risks and Hazards Commission (established by the state legislature in 2013) to help communities and businesses prepare for the impacts of rising seas and coastal storms.",

            "abstract": "The typical approach to assess climate change impacts on water resources systems is based on a vertical integration/coupling of models: GCM models are run to project future precipitations and temperatures, which are then downscaled and used as inputs to hydrologic models whose outputs are processed by water systems models. From a decision-making point of view, this top-down vertical approach presents some challenges. For example, since the range of uncertainty that can be explored with GCM is limited, researchers are relying on ensembles to enlarge the spread, making the modeling approach even more demanding in terms of computation time and resource. When a particular water system must be analyzed, the question is to know whether this computationally intensive vertical approach is necessary in the first place or if we could extrapolate projections available in neighboring systems to feed the water system model? This would be equivalent to a horizontal approach. The proposed study addresses this question by comparing the performance of a water resource system under future climate conditions using the vertical and horizontal approaches. The methodology is illustrated with the hydropower system of the Gatineau River Basin in Quebec, Canada. Vertically obtained hydrologic projections available in those river basins are extrapolated and used as inputs to a stochastic multireservoir optimization model. Two different extrapolation techniques are tested. The first one simply relies on the ratios between the drainage areas. The second exploits the covariance structure found in historical flow data throughout the region. The analysis of the simulation results reveals that the annual and weekly energy productions of the system derived from the horizontal approach are statistically equivalent to those obtained with the vertical one, regardless of the extrapolation technique used.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient loadings in river catchments have increased in the past years as a consequence of rapid expansion of agricultural areas, new urban developments and industries, and population growth. Nutrient enrichment of water bodies has intensified eutrophication conditions that degrade water quality and ecosystem health. In large-scale catchments, the assessment of temporal and spatial variability of nutrient loads imply challenges due to climate, land use and geology heterogeneity, and to anthropogenic changes. In this study we carried out a trend analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) catchment. This catchment is located in the Canadian Prairie Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The eastern and central areas of the catchment consist mostly of croplands, pasture lands and livestock farms, whereas the western parts are located on the Rocky Mountains that are the source of most of the catchment’s streamflows. The trend analysis was performed applying a novel approach to analyse nutrient time series recorded at long-term water quality stations along the main stems of the SSR river network. Since water quality is taken infrequently, in the proposed approach the time series were complemented using regression analysis methods based on streamflow data recorded at the nearest gauge stations. The time series were subsequently pre-whitened in order to remove the autocorrelation, and then subjected to non-parametric statistical test to detect trends. Seasonal analysis of trends at each of the water quality stations were performed in order to determine the relationships between annual flow regimes and nutrient loads in the catchment, in particular, the influence of the high spring runoff on nutrient export. Decadal analysis was also performed to determine the long-tern relationships of nutrients with anthropogenic changes in the catchment. In particular, the capacity of reservoirs to trap nutrients and the effects of the rapid changes in agricultural production in the prairies, represented by increases in crop production and livestock, were evaluated to analyse decadal changes of nutrient trends.",

            "abstract": "The Surma Basin is a sub-basin of the Bengal Basin situated at the northeastern corner of Bangladesh. The tectonically-active basin lies at the junction of three tectonic plates: the Indian plate, the Eurasian plate and the Burma platelet. The Surma Basin is bounded on the north by the Shillong Massif, east and southeast by CTFB of the Indo-Burman Ranges, west by the Indian Shield and to the south and southeast it is open to the main part of Bengal Basin. The Surma basin is subsiding at a high rate, which is controlled by flexure loading along the southern margin of the 2-km high Shillong Massif because of Dauki thrust fault system.\nThe objective of this study is to explore and reconstruct the present scenario of the tectonically active zone of the northeastern Bangladesh, identify the active faults, identify the relation between the neotectonic activities and seismicity, relation between neotectonic activities and natural hazards and describe the nature of the possible future earthquakes. The present effort to establish the tectonics of the Surma basin mainly utilizes the horizontal and vertical movements of the area using GPS geodetic data and other constraints on the structure of the region. We also make use historical seismologic data, field geology, and satellite image data. The GPS data has been processed using GAMIT-GLOBK.\nThe analysis of 5 continuous GPS geodetic stations installed in the Surma Basin are combined with published data from the adjacent parts of India. While the area is moving northeast at a rate of 50-52 mm/year relative to ITRF2008 reference frame, it is moving south in an Indian reference frame. The velocities reflect that the Surma Basin being overthrust by both Shillong Plateau from the north and Burmese microplate from the east, respectively. The combined GPS velocity data indicates shortening across Dauki Fault and Indo Burman Ranges at a rate of 7 mm/yr and 18 mm/yr, respectively. The complex anticlinal structures in and around the Surma Basin are due to the interactions of the generally N-S and E-W shortening of the basin from the overlapping thrust systems. As a result of the tectonics, the low, swampy Sylhet basin is subsiding rapidly with at rates up to 8.4 mm/y at Jamalganj (JAML) and 12.4 mm/yr at Sylhet (SUST), although Sylhet may also be affect by local tectonics related to the anticline of the same name.",

            "abstract": "The hydrologic cycle in many mountainous headwaters around the world have snowmelt dominated hydrographs. In addition to water resources for communities and ecosystems, high rates of snowmelt can cause flooding that results in damages to infrastructure. The standard in the United States flood forecasting looks primarily at rainfall estimates but lacks estimates for high rates of snowmelt in regions such as the Southern Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have shown that events such as a 10 year 24 hour snowmelt event is as much as 45% greater than the same recurrence interval rain event. Additionally, this 24 hour snowmelt likely occurs over a much shorter time period due to snowmelt being primarily driven by solar radiation. This study presents and tests a sub-daily temporal distribution of snowmelt. The snowmelt distribution presented herein is tested against hourly data for known daily melt rates from snow telemetry (SNOTEL) stations, and then for conditions when weekly or bi-weekly snow loss is known. It is additionally utilized for modeling a one-dimensional soil profile for infiltration across the soil-snow interface. The intent of this study is to create a less computationally intensive method than the mass energy approach and improve upon the simple degree-day method for the representation of snowmelt at sub-daily time steps. This can be used for streamflow, groundwater recharge, soil moisture distribution, and other land surface modeling efforts. Results of the study display strong agreement with hourly SNOTEL data from Colorado Front Range stations for an assumed 8-hour melt period. Peak flow estimates from snowmelt driven floods could be estimated from long-term datasets to calculate frequency of these flood events. Further application of this sub-daily distribution of snowmelt could be for partially or fully glaciated watersheds with modifications for differences in latitude and/or elevation causing longer or shorter periods of melt per day.",

            "abstract": "Earlier this year, the eWaterCycle project launched its operational forecasting system (forecast.ewatercycle.org). The forecasts are ensemble based, and cover fourteen days. Near-real-time satellite data on soil moisture are assimilated in the forecasts. Presently, the model runs with a spatial resolution of 10km x 10km, and the plan is to move to 1km x 1km in the near future. The eWaterCycle forecast systems runs on a combination of a supercomputer and a cloud platform. Interactive visualization allows users to zoom in on any area of interest and select different variables. The project builds on close cooperation between hydrologists and computer scientists. What makes eWaterCycle relatively unique is that it was built with existing software, which is largely open source and uses existing standards. The Basic Model Interface (BMI) of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) is an important tool that connects different modules. This allows for easy change and exchange of modules within the project. Only a few parts of the software needed to be re-engineerd for allowing it to run smoothly in a High-Performance Computing environment.\nAfter a general introduction to the modeling framework, the presentation will focus on recent advances, especially with respect to quality control of runoff predictions. Different parts of the world show different predictive error. As the model does not use explicit calibration procedures, it is of interest to see where the model performs well and where it performs not so well. The next natural question is then why this is the case and how to move forward without ending up with ad hoc improvement measures.",

            "abstract": "Deformation microstructures provide evidence for specific microphysical processes and represent an important link between rock deformation experiments, field-based geological studies, and geophysical observations and theory. However, microstructural evolution is complex, reflecting the numerous feedbacks between deformation and recovery processes. Many geophysical interpretations assume that microstructures in nature are near steady-state. For example, the interpretation of seismic anisotropy in terms of mantle flow patterns is generally predicated on the assumption that the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine rapidly orients itself to reflect the kinematics of flow. However, several recent studies have shown that microstructural evolution may occur slowly over long increments of strain history. These observations suggest that there are long transient intervals between changes in the deformation conditions, kinematics, or mechanisms, during which microstructure and rheology continuously evolve. Hence, care must be taken when constructing geophysical models or inversions that depend in some way on microstructure. This presentation will include two examples of microstructures that require large strains to achieve steady-state. The first example is olivine CPO, which can be shown on the basis of experiments and numerical simulations to exhibit long periods of transient evolution. Protracted CPO evolution may have a significant effect on the interpretation of seismic anisotropy, especially near plate boundaries. The second example is based on observations and theory of microstructural damage by dynamic recrystallization and phase mixing. The slow evolution towards the damaged microstructural state provides a new framework for modeling the initiation and evolution of plate boundary shear zones.",

            "abstract": "The width of a river reflects complex interactions between river water hydraulics and other physical factors like bank erosional resistance, sediment supply, and human-made structures. A broad range of fluvial process studies use spatially distributed river width data to understand and quantify flood hazards, river water flux, or fluvial greenhouse gas efflux. Ongoing technological advances in remote sensing, computing power, and model sophistication are moving river system science towards global-scale studies that aim to understand the Earth’s fluvial system as a whole. As such, a global spatially distributed database of river location and width is necessary to better constrain these studies. Here we present the Global River Width from Landsat (GRWL) Database, the first global-scale database of river planform at mean discharge. With a resolution of 30 m, GRWL consists of 58 million measurements of river centerline location, width, and braiding index. In total, GRWL measures 2.1 million km of rivers wider than 30 m, corresponding to 602 thousand km2 of river water surface area, a metric used to calculate global greenhouse gas emissions from rivers to the atmosphere. Using data from GRWL, we find that ~20% of the world’s rivers are located above 60ºN where little high quality information exists about rivers of any kind. Further, we find that ~10% of the world’s large rivers are multichannel, which may impact the development of the new generation of regional and global hydrodynamic models. We also investigate the spatial controls of global fluvial geomorphology and river hydrology by comparing climate, topography, geology, and human population density to GRWL measurements. The GRWL Database will be made publically available upon publication to facilitate improved understanding of Earth’s fluvial system. Finally, GRWL will be used as an a priori data for the joint NASA/CNES Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Satellite Mission, planned for launch in 2020.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s upper mantle is thought to deform mainly by dislocation creep, during which strain-rate and stress are related by a simple power law equation. However at much higher stresses there is a break-down in the power law relationship and strain-rate depends exponentially on stress. This phenomenon, known as low temperature plasticity, may be important in the shallow ductile or semi-brittle regions of the lithosphere, at the tips of cracks, or during high-stress laboratory experiments. Several studies have attempted to constrain the low-temperature rheology of olivine using micro-indentation or high pressure experiments. In this study we provide the first measurements of olivine rheology at low temperature using instrumented nano-indention. Although nano-indentation has been widely used in the materials sciences, its application in the Earth sciences has been very limited. Nano-indentation methods provide rheological measurements that are significantly more precise than other mechanical tests at high pressure and temperature. Moreover, experiments are rapid and largely non-destructive, so many tests can be conducted in a short amount of time. In this study, olivine single crystal and polycrystalline samples were tested using a Hysitron TI950 TriboIndenter. Temperature was varied using a cooling/heating stage from 0-175°C. Experiments were conducted under quasi-static and constant strain-rate conditions. Indentation hardness measurements were converted to uniaxial rheological properties to facilitate direct comparison with previous studies. Yield strengths for olivine range from 4.19 GPa at 175°C to 4.60 GPa at 0°C. Using various models for obstacles to dislocation motion, data are extrapolated to 0 Kelvin to extract a Peierls stress for olivine (5.32-6.45 GPa), which is at the lower end of the range of values determined in previous studies. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the nano-indentation method for the study of mineral rheology, and opens a promising line of micromechanical research in the Earth sciences.",

            "abstract": "The Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft conducted orbital observations of Mercury’s surface from 29 March 2011 to the end of the mission on 30 April 2015. Observing the daylit surface nearly every orbit, the Visible and Infrared Spectrograph (VIRS) component of MASCS obtained near-global coverage of reflectance at ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths (300 though 1450 nm). Additionally, the Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVVS) component of MASCS acquired several thousand surface spectra over the wavelength range 220 to 300 nm. UVVS observations were conducted one at a time, targeting single ~25 km2 areas on the surface. A series of acquisition campaigns obtained UVVS data in target grids of one observation every 200 km across Mercury’s southern hemisphere, with the highest-quality data obtained in the last year of the mission. Each UVVS grid observation was accompanied by contemporaneous VIRS observations with the same viewing geometry and instrument conditions. Joint analyses of ultraviolet reflectance, reflectance ratios, and absorption bands derived from over 1900 UVVS observations co-sited with those from VIRS yield several notable contrasts. Across the southern hemisphere, regions of low-reflectance material (LRM), identified through color imaging by the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) to be low in overall reflectance and low in visible to near infrared spectral slope, also have low spectral slope at short VIRS wavelengths (310 nm / 390 nm), but higher slope in UVVS wavelengths (220 nm / 290 nm). A VIRS-based spectral band derivation, with continuum slope between 480 nm and 830 nm and center wavelength at 630 nm, similar to one derived for MDIS and interpreted to be potentially indicative of the presence of sulfides or carbon, shows moderate to low values for LRM, and higher values for smooth plains. A UVVS-based band, with continuum slope between 220 nm and 290 nm and center wavelength at 260 nm, shows greater band depths in and near LRM regions. Ongoing analysis seeks to interpret whether the UVVS wavelengths can aid compositional distinctions such as between darkening agents such as nanophase iron and carbon, which have different ultraviolet signatures.",

            "abstract": "On 29–30 May 2012, the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array, as part of DC3, observed the entire lifetime of a supercell storm that produced severe hail and a tornado in central Oklahoma until it rapidly dissipated after merging with a left-moving supercell storm near Oklahoma City. Previous conference presentations of data from 2320–0000 UTC have noted that flash rates increased to more than 100 min-1 and updraft speeds in Doppler analyses increased to 55 m s-1. Flash rates continued increasing to a peak of 400 min-1 at 0045 UTC. This paper concerns data from 0101–0111 UTC, when flash rates had decreased to approximately 300 min-1 and the lightning hole was dissipating, just before flash rates increased again as the storm drew near the left-moving supercell storm and merged with it. Between 0101 and 0111 UTC, an automated algorithm that grouped VHF sources into flashes (i.e., groups of VHF sources separated by > 200 ms or > 5 km from previous groups of VHF sources) identified several small flashes at approximately 19 km MSL, above the storm and a few tens of kilometers southeast of the overshooting storm top. A closer examination of these stratospheric “flashes” revealed that all were coincident in time with flashes at an altitude of 8–10 km MSL within the storm. In each of the two levels, most discharges had a horizontal extent of ≤5 km. Stratospheric discharges tended to overlap but extend east of the in-storm discharges and had substantially fewer VHF sources. However, all the VHF sources in the stratosphere clustered in time with bursts of VHF sources at 8–10 km MSL and avoided gaps between the bursts. Mapped VHF sources depicted no connecting channel between the two levels, so either a vertical connecting channel failed to be detected or the stratospheric discharges were triggered by flashes within the storm. Regardless, any chemical species (such as NOx) produced by the upper discharges were injected directly into the lower stratosphere.",

            "abstract": "Global anthropogenic emissions of short-lived O3 precursors (NOx, NMVOCs and CO) have increased since 1980. These increases are greatest in developing countries (China and India), while emissions have generally decreased in North America and Europe. Consequently, emissions have shifted southwards. Modeling studies have shown that the tropospheric O3 burden and resulting radiative forcing are more sensitive to emission changes in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere than in other regions. Here we separate the influence of the change in the spatial distributions of short-lived global anthropogenic emissions from that of the change in the emission magnitude and the change in global CH4 between 1980 and 2010. We use the global CAM-chem model with 2008-2012 GEOS-5 meteorology for all simulations, neglecting possible effects of climate change.\nThe global tropospheric O3 burden is estimated to have increased by 28.12 Tg from 1980 to 2010, with the largest increases over 30°S—30°N (17.93 Tg). Of the total O3 burden change, the influence of the change in the spatial distributions of emissions contributes 16.39 Tg, roughly double the effect of the change in emission magnitude (8.59 Tg) and of the global CH4 change (7.48 Tg). The three-month O3 season MDA8 surface O3 has decreased over the U.S. and Europe, and increased over East and South Asia from 1980 to 2010, mainly because of changes in the emission distributions. Significant increases in the zonal annual average O3 are modeled in the upper troposphere (500 to 150 hPa) between 15°N and 40°N. Upper tropospheric O3 also increases over the U.S. and Europe, despite peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) decreases in the middle to upper troposphere resulting from regional emission reductions. These upper tropospheric changes result from the change in the spatial distributions of emissions, with little from contributions from the changes in emissions magnitude or methane, and reflect the intercontinental transport of O3. We conclude that the changing spatial distribution of emissions has been the most important influence on global tropospheric ozone, more important even than the change in the global emission magnitude. This work highlights the dominant role of the spatial distribution of emissions, and suggests that future ozone burdens will be determined mainly by emissions from the tropics.",

            "abstract": "To numerically capture the large-scale dynamics of atmospheric flows, geophysicists need to rely on reasonable parametrizations of the energy transfers to and from the non-resolved small scale eddies, mediated through turbulence. The task is notoriously not trivial, and is typically solved by ingenious but ad-hoc elaborations on the concept of eddy viscosities.\nThe difficulty is tied into the intrinsic Non-Gaussianity of turbulence, a feature that may explain why standard Quasi-Normal cumulant discard statistical closure strategies can fail dramatically, an example being the development of negative energy spectra in Millionshtchikov's 1941 Quasi-Normal (QN) theory. While Orszag's 1977 Eddy Damped Quasi Normal Markovian closure (EDQNM) provides an ingenious patch to the issue, the reason why the QN theory fails so badly is not so clear. Are closures necessarily either trivial or ad-hoc, when proxies for true ensemble averages are taken to be Gaussian ? The purpose of the talk is to answer negatively, using the lights of a new ``optimal closure framework'' recently exposed by [Turkington,2013]. For turbulence problems, the optimal closure allows a consistent use of a Gaussian Ansatz (and corresponding vanishing third cumulant) that also retains an intrinsic damping. The key to this apparent paradox lies in a clear distinction between the true ensemble averages and their proxies, most easily grasped provided one uses the Liouville equation as a starting point, rather than the cumulant hierarchy. Schematically said, closure is achieved by minimizing a lack-of-fit residual, which retains the intrinsic features of the true dynamics.\nThe optimal closure is not restricted to the Gaussian modeling. Yet, for the sake of clarity, I will discuss the optimal closure on a problem where it can be entirely implemented, and compared to DNS : the relaxation of an arbitrarily far from equilibrium energy shell towards the Gibbs equilibrium for truncated Euler dynamics. Predictive insights are obtained, among which a non-trivial universal relaxation profile for the inverse temperatures (see associated figure). It is associated to a non-standard dissipation operator responsible for the turbulent damping, possibly relevant for atmospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "There is a well-established need within the remote sensing community for improved estimation of canopy structure and understanding of its influence on the retrieval of leaf biochemical properties. The aim of this project was to evaluate the estimation of structural properties directly from hyperspectral data, with the broader goal that these might be used to constrain retrievals of canopy chemistry. We used NASA’s Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to discriminate different canopy structural types, defined in terms of biomass, canopy height and vegetation complexity, and compared them to estimates of these properties measured by LiDAR data. We tested a large number of optical metrics, including single narrow band reflectance and 1st derivative, sub-pixel cover fractions, narrow-band indices, spectral absorption features, and Principal Component Analysis components. Canopy structural types were identified and classified from different forest types by integrating structural traits measured by optical metrics using the Random Forest (RF) classifier.\nThe classification accuracy was above 70% in most of the vegetation scenarios. The best overall accuracy was achieved for hardwood forest (>80% accuracy) and the lowest accuracy was found in mixed forest (~70% accuracy). Furthermore, similarly high accuracy was found when the RF classifier was applied to a spatially independent dataset, showing significant portability for the method used. Results show that all spectral regions played a role in canopy structure assessment, thus the whole spectrum is required. Furthermore, optical metrics derived from AVIRIS proved to be a powerful technique for structural attribute mapping. This research illustrates the potential for using optical properties to distinguish several canopy structural types in different forest types, and these may be used to constrain quantitative measurements of absorbing properties in future research.",

            "abstract": "Ceres is a geophysical puzzle: observations with the Dawn spacecraft have revealed a seemingly old surface saturated with craters, and a shape close to that determined by [1] suggestive of a homogeneous, unevolved interior. These findings strongly contrast with pre-Dawn observations of products of aqueous alteration on Ceres' surface [2], and of water vapor emanating from Ceres [3], as well as with Dawn images of bright regions on the surface, all suggestive of past and ongoing geological activity.\nWe present a model of Ceres' interior that may reconcile these observations. Following [4], we assume that Ceres accreted ice and chondritic rock (both micron-sized rock fines and millimeter-sized chondrules), and that micron-sized fines stayed suspended in liquid. We have carried out geophysical and thermal evolution simulations using a code modified from [5,6], whose outcomes suggest that aqueously altered grains were emplaced on Ceres’ surface during the first tens of Myr of its evolution. We have also performed geochemical simulations using the PHREEQC code [7] of the interaction between pure liquid water and assemblages of chondritic elemental and mineral composition [8,9]. Their outcomes suggest that Ceres’ unusual surface mineralogy is consistent with aqueous alteration at T ≥ 200oC. This requires an early ocean formed by heating from 26Al decay.\nThermal evolution simulations, including insulating fines, yield present-day temperatures at the core-mantle boundary of 240-250 K, just warm enough for chloride brines to persist and be freezing today [10]. Ongoing freezing may over-pressurize brine pockets, driving cryovolcanic outflow whose surface expression may have been observed by Dawn at Ceres’ ‘bright spots’. These outflows may be contributing to the water vapor being produced at Ceres.\n[1] Drummond et al. (2014) Icarus 236, 28-37\n[2] Milliken & Rivkin (2009) Nat. Geosc. 2, 258-261\n[3] Küppers et al.

            "abstract": "Groundwater extraction is the primary source of irrigation water in many agricultural regions throughout the world. A set of spatially dense hydraulic head measurements adequately sampling the aquifer is a critical metric needed for effective water management. Because the total compaction due to pumping is nearly proportional to the change in hydraulic head, land subsidence measurements derived from InSAR data can be used to obtain head measurements in confined aquifers when well data are unavailable or insufficiently dense.\nReeves at al. (2013) demonstrated that C-band ERS InSAR data acquired between 1992 and 2000 over the San Luis Valley of Colorado suffice to fill temporal gaps in the hydraulic head field dataset at 3 well locations. Here, we further analyze whether the InSAR deformation time series can be used to infer head levels over a larger region than Reeves et al. analyzed. We processed 17 L-band ALOS radar scenes over the San Luis Valley acquired between Jan., 2007 and Mar., 2011 and applied an adaptive interpolation filter between persistent scatterer pixels to reduce vegetation decorrelation artifacts. We estimated the InSAR deformation time series at each image point using a least-squares SBAS approach. We then jointly analyzed the InSAR and the well data to estimate the local skeletal storage coefficient and the time delay between the head change and deformation and converted the InSAR deformation time series to InSAR head levels. The resulting InSAR-head and well-head measurements in the San Luis valley show good agreement with all 18 well measurements in the region with confined aquifer pumping activities. Assuming that geologic parameters such as skeletal storage coefficients often vary slowly in space, we interpolate the obtained skeletal storage coefficients at each well spatially to relate InSAR subsidence measurements over the entire SLV to changes in head with improved spatial resolution over the well data. This demonstration shows that InSAR is a promising technique for measuring confined aquifer head levels and hence groundwater management.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles that can serve as ice nuclei frequently experience rapid and extensive chemical aging during atmospheric transport. This is known to significantly alter some ice nucleation modes of the few types of ice nucleation particle systems where aging effects have been simulated, such as for mineral dust. Yet much of our understanding of atmospheric particle freezing properties is derived from measurements of fresh or unaged particles. We know almost nothing regarding how atmospheric aging might alter the freezing properties of biomass burning aerosol or biological particle nucleants.\nWe have investigated the effects of simulated aging using a chamber reactor on the heterogeneous ice nucleation properties of biomass burning aerosol (BBA) and ice-active bacteria particles. Some types of aging were found to enhance the freezing ability of BBA, exhibited as a shift in a portion of the droplet freezing curve to warmer temperatures by a few °C. Ice-active bacteria were found to consistently loose their most ice-active nucleants after repeated aging cycles. The bacterial systems always retained significantly efficient ice active sites that still allowed them to induce freezing at mild/warm temperatures, despite this decrease in freezing ability.\nA comprehensive series of online single-particle mass spectrometry and offline spectromicroscopic analysis of individual particles was used to determine how the aging altered the aerosol’s composition, and gain mechanistic insights into how this in turn altered the freezing properties. Our new ice nucleation framework that uses a continuous distribution of ice active site ability (contact angle) was used to interpret the droplet freezing spectra and understand how aging alters the internal and external variability, and rigidity, of the ice active sites.",

            "abstract": "The assessment of canopy biochemical diversity is critical for monitoring ecological and physiological functioning and for mapping vegetation change dynamics in relation to environmental resources. For example in oak woodland savannas, these dynamics are mainly driven by water constraints. Inversion using radiative transfer theory is one method for estimating canopy biochemistry. However, this approach generally only considers relatively simple scenarios to model the canopy due to the difficulty in encompassing stand heterogeneity with spatial and temporal consistency. In this research, we compared 3 modeling strategies for estimating canopy biochemistry variables (i.e. chlorophyll, carotenoids, water, dry matter) by coupling of the PROSPECT (leaf level) and DART (canopy level) models : i) a simple forest representation made of ellipsoid trees, and two representations taking into account the tree species and structural composition, and the landscape spatial pattern, using (ii) geometric tree crown shapes and iii) detailed tree crown and wood structure retrieved from terrestrial lidar acquisitions. AVIRIS 18m remote sensing data are up-scaled to simulate HyspIRI 30m images. Both spatial resolutions are validated by measurements acquired during 2013-2014 field campaigns (cover/tree inventory, LAI, leaf sampling, optical measures). The results outline the trade-off between accurate and abstract canopy modeling for inversion purposes and may provide perspectives to assess the impact of the California drought with multi-temporal monitoring of canopy biochemistry traits.",

We find that the strong turbulence associated with wave breaking is isolated to a small region (nominally less than one meter) beneath the surface. However, this strong turbulence is advected vertically by the orbital motions of the dominant waves, and thus, in an Eulerian reference frame, the strong turbulence penetrates below the wave trough level. We also test several scalings for the turbulent dissipation rates caused by wave breaking, and we conclude that the conventional scaling by the cube of the wind speed (or wind friction velocity) is biased, particularly in high winds. A formulation using a transfer velocity associated with the short waves and the wind stress is more successful in scaling the observations.",

            "abstract": "Models in biogeoscience involve uncertainties in observation data, model inputs, model structure, model processes and modeling scenarios. To accommodate for different sources of uncertainty, multimodal analysis such as model combination, model selection, model elimination or model discrimination are becoming more popular. To illustrate theoretical and practical challenges of multimodal analysis, we use an example about microbial soil respiration modeling. Global soil respiration releases more than ten times more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than all anthropogenic emissions. Thus, improving our understanding of microbial soil respiration is essential for improving climate change models. This study focuses on a poorly understood phenomena, which is the soil microbial respiration pulses in response to episodic rainfall pulses (the “Birch effect”). We hypothesize that the “Birch effect” is generated by the following three mechanisms. To test our hypothesis, we developed and assessed five evolving microbial-enzyme models against field measurements from a semiarid Savannah that is characterized by pulsed precipitation. These five model evolve step-wise such that the first model includes none of these three mechanism, while the fifth model includes the three mechanisms. The basic component of Bayesian multimodal analysis is the estimation of marginal likelihood to rank the candidate models based on their overall likelihood with respect to observation data. The first part of the study focuses on using this Bayesian scheme to discriminate between these five candidate models. The second part discusses some theoretical and practical challenges, which are mainly the effect of likelihood function selection and the marginal likelihood estimation methods on both model ranking and Bayesian model averaging. The study shows that making valid inference from scientific data is not a trivial task, since we are not only uncertain about the candidate scientific models, but also about the statistical methods that are used to discriminate between these models.",

            "abstract": "This work studies the hydroclimatological variability and the climatic precursors of drought in the Central American Dry Corridor (CADC), a subregion located in the Pacific coast of Southern Mexico and Central America. Droughts are frequent in the CADC, which is featured by a higher climatological aridity compared to the highlands and Caribbean coast of Central America. The CADC region presents large social vulnerability to hydroclimatological impacts originated from dry conditions, as there is a large part of population that depends on subsistance agriculture.\nThe influence of large-scale climatic precursors such as ENSO, the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ), low frequency signals from the Pacific and Caribbean and some intra-seasonal signals such as the MJO are evaluated. Previous work by the authors identified a connection between the CLLJ and CADC precipitation. This connection is more complex than a simple rain-shadow effect, and instead it was suggested that convection at the exit of the jet in the Costa-Rica and Nicaragua Caribbean coasts and consequent subsidence in the Pacific could be playing a role in this connection. During summer, when the CLLJ is stronger than normal, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (located mainly in the Pacific) displaces to a more southern position, and vice-versa, suggesting a connection between these two processes that has not been fully explained yet. The role of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool also needs more research. All this is important, as it suggest a working hypothesis that during summer, the effect of the Caribbean wind strength may be responsible for the dry climate of the CADC. \nAnother previous analysis by the authors was based on downscaled precipitation and temperature from GCMs and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The data was later used in a hydrological model. Results showed a negative trend in reanalysis' runoff for 1980-2012 in San José (Costa Rica) and Tegucigalpa (Honduras). This highly significant drying trend can be considered extreme when compared to the trends from 30 GCM runs for the same period. Also, drier conditions are expected at the end of the century for the Central American region. It is important to determine if these future changes are associated with strengthtening of the CLLJ, which could cause drier climate in the CADC at the end of the century.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of meandering river channels results from interactions amongst turbulent water flow, sediment transport, and channel geometry. Most current physics-based models derive from the meander-morphodynamics equations introduced by Ikeda et al. (1981). Corresponding linear theories, which serve as our theoretical understanding of meander behavior, have depended on the assumption of an infinite domain. We believe that infinite-domain theory cannot fully describe the behavior of experimental systems, which are finite in flume length, and which do not generally make use of periodic boundary conditions that would justify such an approximation. Here we consider any solution to the meander-morphodynamics equations as a series of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which can capture the initial and boundary conditions of an experimental system. Rigorous mathematical consideration of the equations demonstrates that for a solution to be unique, it is necessary to specify three boundary conditions. In particular, whenever the upstream boundary is ‘clamped’ (i.e., a fixed injection point), theory predicts that a straight channel will propagate downstream. We believe this describes behavior that has been observed in most experimental work and may be the reason that meandering channels are so notoriously difficult to reproduce in a laboratory setting: mathematical theory shows that a self-maintained dynamic meandering channel cannot persist without a continuous upstream perturbation. This result implies that the formative conditions of natural meandering rivers also involves upstream driving. The numerical algorithms presented in this work are fully implicit and yield 2D solutions to the meander-morphodynamics equations with second order spatial and temporal convergence. We explore the characteristics of various upstream boundary conditions, and especially driven boundary conditions. Consideration of the growth patterns for spatially growing waves provides some insight for the design of experimental systems exhibiting self-sustaining river meanders.",

            "abstract": "Circular polarization (CP) produced by scattering of sunlight on cometary dust has been observed in 11 comets, and showed the values from 0.01% to 0.8%. CP of both signs was observed, although negative (left-handed) CP dominates. Recent observations of several comets using SCORPIO-2 focal reducer at the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (Russia) allowed producing maps of CP in the comet continuum filter at 684 nm and red wide-band filter. A gradual increase of the CP with the nucleocentric distance was usually observed.\nThe most plausible reason why the light scattered by cometary dust becomes circularly polarized is alignment of the dust particles in the solar magnetic field. However, in-situ data for comet Halley, indicated that the solar magnetic field could not penetrate deep into the coma, limited by the diamagnetic cavity, and, thus, could not be responsible for the CP observed closer than ~4000 km from the nucleus. Advanced theoretical studies of interaction of the solar magnetic field with cometary ions led to reconsidering the diamagnetic cavity boundary - it is defined by the cometary ionopause, at which a balance is achieved between the magnetic pressure in the magnetic pile up region and the neutral friction force. The nucleocentric distance where this balance is achieved depends on the comet characteristics, increasing with the increase of the gas production rate, and local solar wind conditions, approximatively given by the comet location, specifically, its heliocentric distance. The size of diamagnetic cavity was calculated for the conditions of our CP observations. We found that it could be as small as dozens (comets 73P, 8P, 290P) or hundreds (comets Q4 NEAT, K1 PanSTARRS, Tago-Sato-Kosaka) kilometers. Thus, non-zero CP close to the nucleus can be easily explained by the interaction of the dust particles with the solar magnetic field. This mechanism also explains the observed increase in CP with the distance from the nucleus.",

With the development and industrialization of the developing Asian countries, anthropogenic aerosols have received considerable attentions and remain to be the largest uncertainty in the climate projection. Here we assess the performance of two stat-of-art global climate models (National Center for Atmospheric Research-Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmosphere Model 3 (AM3)) in simulating the impacts of anthropogenic aerosols on North Pacific storm track region. By contrasting two aerosol scenarios, i.e. present day (PD) and pre-industrial (PI), both models show aerosol optical depth (AOD) enhanced by about 22%, with CAM5 AOD 40% lower in magnitude due to the long range transport of anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosol effects on the ice water path (IWP), stratiform precipitation, convergence and convection strengths in the two models are distinctive in patterns and magnitudes. AM3 shows qualitatively good agreement with long-term satellite observations, while CAM5 overestimates convection and liquid water path resulting in an underestimation of large-scale precipitation and IWP. Due to coarse resolution and parameterization in convection schemes, both models’ performance on convection needs to be improved. Aerosols performance on large-scale circulation and radiative budget are also examined in this study.",

            "abstract": "North and South Korea have experienced more frequent and extreme droughts since the late 1990s. In recent years, severe droughts in 2000-2001, 2012, and 2015 have led to widespread agricultural and environmental impacts, and resulted in water shortages and large reductions in crop yields. This has been particularly problematic in the agricultural sector of North Korea, which has a high-level of vulnerability due to variations of climate and this, in turn, results in food security issues. This vulnerability is exacerbated by North Korea’s relatively small area of arable land, most of which is not very productive. The objective of this study was to develop a drought management application using climate- and remote sensing-based tools for North and South Korea. These tools are essential for improving drought planning and preparedness in this area. In this study, various drought indicators derived from climate and remote sensing data (SPI, SC-PDSI, SPEI, and VegDRI-Korea) were investigated to monitor the current drought condition and evaluate their ability to characterize agricultural and meteorological drought events and their potential impacts. Results from this study can be used to develop or improve the national-level drought management application for these countries. The goal is to provide improved and more timely information on both the spatial and temporal dimensions of drought conditions and provide a tool to identify both past and present drought events in order to make more informed management decisions and reduce the impacts of current droughts and reduce the risk to future events.",

            "abstract": "Deep-focus earthquakes, located 300 to 700 km below the Earth’s surface within sinking slabs of relatively cold oceanic lithosphere, are mysterious phenomena. Seismic radiation from deep events is essentially indistinguishable from that for shallow stick-slip frictional-sliding earthquakes, but the confining pressure and temperature are so high for deep-focus events that a distinct process is likely needed to account for their abrupt energy release. The largest recorded deep-focus earthquake (MW 7.9) in the Izu-Bonin slab struck on 30 May 2015 beneath the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, isolated from prior seismicity by over 100 km in depth, and followed by only 2 small aftershocks. Globally, this is the deepest (678 km) major (MW > 7) earthquake in the seismological record. Seismicity indicates along-strike contortion of the Izu-Bonin slab, with horizontal flattening near a depth of 550 km in the Izu region and progressive steepening to near-vertical toward the south above the location of the 2015 event. Analyses of a large global data set of P, SH and pP seismic phases using short-period back-projection, subevent directivity, and broadband finite-fault inversion indicate that the mainshock ruptured a shallowly-dipping fault plane with patchy slip that spread over a distance of ~40 km with variable expansion rate (~5 km/s down-dip initially, ~3 km/s up-dip later). During the 17 s rupture duration the radiated energy was ~3.3 x 1016 J and the stress drop was ~38 MPa. The radiation efficiency is moderate (0.34), intermediate to that of the 1994 Bolivia and 2013 Sea of Okhotsk MW 8.3 earthquakes, indicating a continuum of processes. The isolated occurrence of the event suggests that localized stress concentration associated with the pronounced deformation of the Izu-Bonin slab likely played a role in generating this major earthquake.",

            "abstract": "After the catastrophic 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, attention focussed on the segment of the Sunda subduction system along the heavily populated region of the Bay of Bengal. Here the Indian plate is converging obliquely with the Burma arc at GPS rates of 14mm/yr. The extremely thick sediments (~20km) of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD) are accreted into a very wide thrust-fold belt. Despite some likely aseismic deformation, the great 1762 earthquake proves the seismogenic potential of this boundary. Evidence is mounting that the earthquake ruptured 700km of the boundary from the Bengal Fan to the GBD shelf along Myanmar and Bangladesh. Recent U-Th ages and GPS measurements in Saint Martin Island, an anticline in the outer part of the accretion belt on the shelf, showed that corals died and were uplifted 2.5m coseismically during the 1762 earthquake. Historic accounts and modelling predicted a 1762 tsunami, but geologic evidence for it was not previously reported.\nWe found in both Saint Martin and ~20km north on the Teknaf coast strong evidence for tsunami emplacement. In Saint Martin we discovered a shelly sand layer that extends ~4km in the center of the island. The layer contains shallow water foraminifers, coral fragments and molluscs. Twenty C-14 ages from the shell layer range 1440-1753 cal yrs AD and average 1600 cal yrs AD. We also studied a shell layer that extends for 16,500 m2 on top of a terrace that is now 2m above present sea level and pre-1762 earthquake elevation. Ten C14 ages obtained from the shell bed range 1689-1875 cal yrs AD and average 1753 cal yrs AD. This bed is 1.2m thick and composed of molluscs and foraminifers of intertidal and subtidal origin currently found in shelf depths of 0-100 m. The layer is composed of cobble to mud size sediment and although chaotic, we identified at least three pulses of coarse sediment within an overall fining-upwards unit.\nThe studied 1762 shoreline uplift is likely to partly include coseiesmic elastic deformation associated with the 1762 rupture, following slow elastic subsidence, and partly related to the growth uplift due to thickening of the accretion wedge. To produce that large 2m coastal uplift and tsunami deposit with offshore fossil assemblages, in the study area, the megathrust, likely blind and nearly horizontal, must have ruptured near the deformation front.",

            "abstract": "Despite a multitude of research efforts in recent history, theoretical and modeling predictions of the structure of the reconnection diffusion region continue to uncover a multitude of surprises. A common theme among most predictions is a complex structure, with prominent spatial gradients, which determine the variation of magnetic fields, currents, and structures of distribution functions. On the electron scales, there is growing consensus that these scales are given either by the electron bounce width or by local electron Larmor radii, but many unsolved puzzles remain, particularly in asymmetric configurations, like those investigated by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission during the first part of its scientific mission. In this presentation, we will present an overview of recent results pertaining to the electron physics of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. We will describe both general features, likely to be encountered in any asymmetric system, as well as features, which depend on key parameters such as magnetic shear angle and temperature and density asymmetries. Ww will compare these predictions to MMS observations of magnetopause reconnection.",

However, its primary controls at the global scale are poorly understood and observation-based global estimates are lacking. We synthesized data from XX published studies across global forest ecosystems and examined the relationships between annual ES and abiotic factors (mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP)) and biotic factors (gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), leaf area index (LAI), soil CO2 efflux (RS), root CO2 efflux (RA), foliar CO2 efflux, basal area, and stand age). Based on our compiled datasets, the mean annual ES was 90 ± 43 g C m-2 yr-1, 160 ± 79 g C m-2 yr-1 and 501 ± 363 g C m-2 yr-1 for boreal, temperate, and tropical forest ecosystems, respectively. Average apparent Q10 of ES for boreal forests was 1.85, 2.29 for temperate forests, and 2.26 for tropical forests. Globally, MAT and MAP explained 32% and 24% of the variation in annual ES, respectively. Positive linear relationships exist between ES and forest production (GPP and NPP), LAI, RS, and RA in different forest ecosystems. These correlations hold for the global dataset, as well as for temperate and tropical forest ecosystems independently. In addition, we found no correlation between ES and both RS and RA after accounting for temperature and GPP effects. The predicted a global annual ES was about 6.1Pg C yr-1.",

            "abstract": "Landslides are important fluvial sediment sources, often characterized by distinct grain size distributions that may be useful for tracking sediment transport and channel bed evolution and understanding associated size fractionation. Landslide grain sizes may also leave an imprint of past triggering events in sedimentary archives. Here we investigate the grain size characteristics of landslide and river bed sediments in the Min Jiang river basin draining the Longmen Shan range, in Sichuan, China. The large number of landslides triggered by the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake provides a natural experiment for exploring sediment transport and grain size evolution. We report new grain size information for landslide and river bed sediments from field work (pit digging, sieving and photographing) and lab work (wet sieving, photo analysis and statistical processing). We constrain the grain size of sediment sources by combining previously published grain size data from >100 earthquake-triggered landslides with new data collected from river bed sediments from several low-order, small catchments. We track the spatial evolution of grain size in river sediment across the Longmen Shan range, from the upper Min Jiang with little influence from co-seismic landslides to the epicentral region with intensive landsliding, and we explore how landslides modulate the grain size signal carried by river sediment. Overall, this work contributes a key dataset for modeling post-earthquake sediment transport and sheds light on how sediment grain sizes evolve in response to a large earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The empirical relationship between tropical oceanic precipitation in a grid and the moisture content in the column atop the grid is well established. There exists a critical value of column moisture below which the mean precipitation is negligible, and above which it rises rapidly or “picks-up”. We re-examine this relationship with a closer look at its convective and stratiform aspects, using data from the DYNAMO field campaign, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA). On daily and hourly time scales, and across all tropical ocean basins, we find that the pick-up is pronounced for stratiform rainfall, while convective rainfall, in contrast only displays a weak pick-up above column moisture. The non-linearity of the precipitation-column moisture curves and the differences between convective and stratiform curves relax at the monthly timescale. We conclude that the environmental moisture content is a stronger constraint on stratiform than convective rain. We also speculate that mesoscale dynamics are responsible for producing the strong non-linearity of the stratiform precipitation curve. These findings suggest that to accurate capture sub-grid scale convection in Global Climate Models (GCMs), we must make strides towards parameterizing mesoscale convective systems (MCSs).",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) promote a fundamental shift in the way science is taught. The new focus is on three-dimensional learning, which brings science and engineering practices together with disciplinary core ideas and cross-cutting concepts. A key component is performance expectations rather than bullet lists of content that students should know. One of the stated goals is that “all students should have sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on related issues.”\nWhile the NGSS were developed for K-12, college instructors benefit from familiarity with them in two critical ways: first, they provide a research-based and clearly articulated approach to three-dimensional learning that applies across the grade spectrum, and second, future K-12 teachers are sitting in their college-level science courses, and awareness of the skills those future teachers need can help direct course design. More specifically, while most college-level science courses make use of the science and engineering practices described in the NGSS, few offer explicit instruction in them or how they intertwine with disciplinary core ideas and cross-cutting concepts. Yet this explicit instruction is critical to building scientific literacy in future teachers—and all students.\nMany textbooks and laboratory courses limit a discussion of the process of science to one chapter or exercise, and expect students to be able to apply those concepts. In contrast, new resources from Visionlearning (http://www.visionlearning.com), InTeGrate (http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate), and other projects hosted at the Science Education Resource Center (http://serc.carleton.edu) were developed with explicit and pervasive integration of the nature and practices of science in mind.

            "abstract": "In the face of on-going climatic warming and land-use change, there is growing concern that temperate forest landscapes could be near a tipping point where relatively small changes to the fire regime or altered post-fire vegetation dynamics could lead to extensive conversion to shrublands or savannas. To evaluate vulnerability and resilience to such conversion, we develop a simple model based on three factors we hypothesize to be key in predicting temperate forest responses to changing fire regimes: (1) the hazard rate (i.e., the probability of burning in the next year given the time since the last fire) in closed-canopy forests, (2) the hazard rate for recently-burned, open-canopy vegetation, and (3) the time to redevelop canopy closure following fire. We generate a response surface representing the proportions of the landscape potentially supporting closed-canopy forest and non-forest vegetation under nearly all combinations of these three factors. We then place real landscapes on this response surface to assess the type and magnitude of changes to the fire regime that would drive extensive forest loss. We show that the deforestation of much of New Zealand that followed initial human colonization and the introduction of a new ignition source ca. 750 years ago was essentially inevitable due to the slow rate of forest recovery after fire and the high flammability of post-fire vegetation. In North America’s Pacific Northwest, by contrast, a predominantly forested landscape persisted despite two periods of widespread burning in the recent past due in large part to faster post-fire forest recovery and less pronounced differences in flammability between forests and the post-fire vegetation. We also assess the factors that could drive extensive deforestation in other regions to identify where management could reduce this potential and to guide field and modeling work to better understand the responses and ecological feedbacks to changing fire regimes.",

            "abstract": "The majority of soil-related climate change research has focused on describing the problem – estimating rates of carbon (C) losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural and managed ecosystems. More research is needed to explore potential solutions to climate change through mitigation and adaptation. Here we report on an integrated set of studies aimed at critically evaluating the biogeochemical potential of rangeland soils to help mitigate climate change, while improving the sustainability and productivity of food production systems. We explored direct effects through enhanced net primary production (NPP) and soil C sequestration, and indirect effects through diversion of high emitting sources to lower emitting organic matter dynamics. We used a combination of long- and short-term field experiments, modeling, laboratory assays, life cycle assessment (LCA), and meta-analyses in consultation with a diverse group of stakeholders from both the private and public sectors.\nWe found that organic matter amendments held particularly strong potential. Compost amendments increased soil C storage by 0.5-1.0 Mg C ha-1 y-1 in surface soils over 5 y, and increased NPP and water holding capacity. We measured 1.0 Mg of new C ha-1 y-1 over 3 y. Long-term amendment of cattle manure increased surface soil C by 19.0±7.3 Mg C ha-1 relative to unmanured fields. However, field and modeling experiments suggested that manure amendments lead to large nitrous oxide emissions that eventually eliminated CO2e benefits, whereas compost amendments continued to benefit climate for decades longer. An LCA identified a broader range of climate impacts. When scaled to an area of 25% of California’s rangelands, new C sequestered following compost amendments (21 million Mg CO2e) exceeded emissions from cattle (15 million Mg CO2e); diverting organics from waste streams to amendments led to additional GHG savings. In collaboration with our partners, our research contributed to the development of a protocol for compost amendments, which is being used by stakeholders in C markets and by government agencies in climate action planning. In summary, we hope that our research and related activities will serve as a “call to arms” to the scientific community by highlighting a new and much needed arena for rigorous scientific research.",

Here one minute averaged amplitude and phase data have been used for analysis. We present perturbations in VLF propagation and D-region changes associated with 13 November 2012 total solar eclipse (SE) and 9-10 May 2013 annular SE using VLF observations at Suva, Fiji. During 13-14 November 2012 total SE, the totality shadow intercepted NWC-Suva path and NWC signal amplitude and phase decreased by about 0.70 dB and 23°, respectively. NPM signal amplitude during 9-10 May 2013 SE decreased by about 2.0 dB. The amplitude perturbation of ~1.8 dB on NLK signal was measured from the unperturbed level associated with 9-10 May 2013 SE. The decrease in the amplitude at the site can be understood in terms of destructive interference of modes converted at the discontinuity created by the eclipse intercepting the different Transmitter-receiver great circle paths (TRGCPs) and changes in the propagation conditions along TRGCPs. The decrease in the amplitude and phase of NWC signal for 13-14 November 2012 SE has been modeled using Long Wave Propagation Capability code to estimate the changes in D-region reflection height (H') and sharpness factor (β) which shows that H' and β were increased by 0.95 km and 0.01 km-1, respectively. The phase changes on NWC signal associated with 9-10 May 2013 SE have been used to estimate the recombination coefficient value, for 75 km height where electron density reduction due to SE was about 40%. The changes in the D-region parameters and the electron density are due to sudden decrease of the photo-ionization creating nighttime like conditions in the D-region ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated the utility of multispectral information from satellite passive radiometers for detecting and retrieving the properties of cloud globally, which conventionally utilizes shortwave- and thermal-infrared bands. However, the satellite-derived cloud information comes mainly from cloud top or represents a vertically integrated property. This can produce a large bias in determining cloud phase characteristics, in particular for mixed-phase clouds which are often observed to have supercooled liquid water at cloud top but a predominantly ice phase residing below. The current satellite retrieval algorithms may report these clouds simply as supercooled liquid without any further information regarding the presence of a sub-cloud-top ice phase. More accurate characterization of these clouds is very important for climate models and aviation applications.\nIn this study, we present a physical basis and preliminary results for the algorithm development of supercooled liquid-topped mixed-phase cloud detection using satellite radiometer observations. The detection algorithm is based on differential absorption properties between liquid and ice particles in the shortwave-infrared bands. Solar reflectance data in narrow bands at 1.6 μm and 2.25 μm are used to optically probe below clouds for distinction between supercooled liquid-topped clouds with and without an underlying mixed phase component. Varying solar/sensor geometry and cloud optical properties are also considered. The spectral band combination utilized for the algorithm is currently available on Suomi NPP Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), and the future GOES-R Advance Baseline Imager (ABI). When tested on simulated cloud fields from WRF model and synthetic ABI data, favorable results were shown with reasonable threat scores (0.6-0.8) and false alarm rates (0.1-0.2). An ARM/NSA case study applied to VIIRS data also indicated promising potential of the algorithm.",

We present a remote imagery approach that maps salinity within a range (i.e., salinities less than 20 dS m-1, when measured as the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract), accuracy, and resolution most relevant to agriculture. A case study is presented for the western San Joaquin Valley (WSJV), California, USA (~870,000 ha of farmland) using multi-year Landsat 7 ETM+ canopy reflectance and the Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI). Highly detailed salinity maps for 22 fields (542 ha) established from apparent soil electrical conductivity directed sampling were used as ground-truth (sampled in 2013), totaling over 5000 pixels (30×30 m) with salinity values in the range of 0 to 35.2 dS m-1. Multi-year maximum values of CRSI were used to model soil salinity. In addition, soil type, elevation, meteorological data, and crop type were evaluated as covariates. The fitted model (R2=0.73) was validated: i) with a spatial k-folds (i.e., leave-one-field-out) cross-validation (R2=0.61), ii) versus salinity data from three independent fields (sampled in 2013 and 2014), and iii) by determining the accuracy of the qualitative classification of white crusted land as extremely-saline soils. The effect of land use change is evaluated over 2396 ha in the Broadview Water District from a comparison of salinity mapped in 1991 with salinity predicted in 2013 from the fitted model. From 1991 to 2013 salinity increased significantly over the selected study site, bringing attention to potential negative effects on soil quality of shifting from irrigated agriculture to fallow-land. This is cause for concern since over the 3 years of California’s drought (2010-2013) the fallow land in the WSJV increased from 12.7% to 21.6%, due to drastic reduction in water allocations to farmers.",

            "abstract": "Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are increasingly used for basin boundaries delineation in a variety of hydro-climatic studies. However, accuracy of basin areas depends on quality of DEMs and adopted methods. This study presents auto and supervised delineation in a case study of the Indus Basin (IB), which originates in the Himalayan Mountains and ends in the Arabian Sea. The published estimates of the IB area show significant variability, ranging from 866,000 to 1,230,000 km2. Auto-delineation has been carried out using three DEMs: 1. GTOPO 30 (1km resolution), 2. GTOPO 30 Hydro1K (1km resolution), and 3. SRTM DEM (90m resolution). It is shown that discrepancies between different estimates reflect differences in the initial extent of the DEMs used for basin delineation, and are due to reiterating auto pit-filling process. Four critical points (where overestimates were suspected) have been selected, based on auto-delineated streams together with overlay of the minimum and maximum available basin boundaries, and were evaluated based on Google Earth and flow data. This study shows that the Pangong basin (in western Tibet), Gaggar-Hakra basin (starts from Himachal Pradesh and ends in the western part of the Thar desert) concomitant with downstream part of the Sukkur Barrage are not part of the IB, but are areas of either internal drainage basins or downstream command areas of the Indus River. Our best estimate of the IB area is ~833,000 km2, and is in good agreement with the basin area by HydroSHEDS. This study recommends a revisit of earlier hydro-climatic studies, which are based on overestimated basin boundaries, and recommends to use the current study’s results for future improvements. The important cautionary message of current study is to adopt supervised delineation, and to evaluate accuracy of auto-delineated areas based on geomorphology and flow data, particularly when there are endorheic lake basins or deserts in the vicinity.",

There are relatively few analyses of planktonic trace metals and their associated role in the biogeochemical system. We had the opportunity to investigate the composition of plankton in a region heavily affected by dust, a significant factor for phytoplankton growth. Our samples were collected from 2012 to 2015 using trace metal clean net tows with mesh sizes of 50 and 200 microns for measurements of phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively. Samples were totally digested and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The biogenic portion was determined by subtracting the lithogenic portion from the total concentration. The lithogenic fraction was defined as the concentration of aluminum in the sample multiplied by a [Me]/Al ratio. Using average Qatari dust for these ratios generated a significant amount of overcorrection, so ratios were established using average upper continental crust (UCC). This method still caused some overcorrection for the lithogenic portion resulting in negative excess values for barium, molybdenum, and lead. These same elements showed the least consistency between measurements. For the other elements, a relative stoichiometry for plankton was determined as Fe > Cu ≈ Zn > As ≈ Cr ≈ Mn ≈ Ni ≈ V > Cd ≈ Co. We also found a significant near shore enrichment for 9 out of 13 elements analyzed, indicative of a possible influence of coastal processes.",

            "abstract": "Alpine watersheds source major rivers in many regions of the world and thereby supply essential water for irrigation, human consumption, and hydroelectricity. Coarse depositional units in alpine catchments, such as taluses and proglacial moraines, are thought to store and transmit significant volumes of groundwater and thus buffer flooding during snowmelt and augment stream discharge during the dry season when water supply is critical. This study focuses on the hydrologic functions of an alpine talus unit within the Lake O’Hara watershed in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia. Previous field investigations indicate that the talus exhibits very high hydraulic conductivity, low storage capacity, and a fast hydrograph recession with an exponential decay of approximately 1 d-1. Despite the low storage and flashy response to snowmelt input, the isotopic signature of the stream fed by the talus indicates that the discharging water is predominantly pre-event water.\nHerein we investigate internal processes controlling the bulk hydrologic functioning of this talus unit using a finite element model of coupled subsurface water flow and transport. The hydrologic parameters of the model are calibrated to achieve congruence between the simulated and observed response (lag time) to the snowmelt input. The transport equation is employed to simulate the age of discharging water and investigate how the mean transit time is influenced by hydraulic conductivity, boundary conditions, and talus geometry (e.g., step features in the bedrock plane beneath the talus). The hydraulic properties and talus boundaries are adjusted within the model to see how other talus units with differing geologic composition and geometry may store and transmit water and thus attenuate flood stage or enhance baseflow in other alpine catchments. Also, earlier snowmelt infiltration is considered to examine how a warming climate may influence the timing and magnitude of talus discharge to alpine streams.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) release during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 55.8 Myr BP) acidified the oceans, causing a decrease in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) preservation. During the subsequent recovery from this acidification, the sediment CaCO3 content came to exceed pre-PETM values, known as over-deepening or over-shooting. Past studies claim to explain these trends, but have failed to reproduce quantitatively the time series of CaCO3 preservation. We employ a simple biogeochemical model to recreate the CaCO3 records preserved at Walvis Ridge of the Atlantic Ocean. Replication of the observed changes, both shallowing and the subsequent over-deepening, requires two conditions not previously considered: (1) limited deep-water exchange between the Indo-Atlantic and Pacific oceans and (2) a ~50% reduction in the export of CaCO3 to the deep sea during acidification. Contrary to past theories that attributed over-deepening to increased riverine alkalinity input, we find that over-deepening is an emergent property, generated at constant riverine input when attenuation of CaCO3 export causes an unbalanced alkalinity input to the deep oceans (alkalinization) and the development of deep super-saturation. Restoration of CaCO3 export, particularly in the super-saturated deep Indo-Atlantic ocean, later in the PETM leads to greater accumulation of carbonates, ergo over-shooting, which returns the ocean to pre-PETM conditions over a time scale greater than 200 kyr. While this feedback between carbonate export and the riverine input has not previously been considered, it appears to constitute an important modification of the classic carbonate compensation concept used to explain oceanic response to acidification.

Recent studies have also suggested that light alkane flux that is given off in combination with the methane also is underreported in local and global budgets. This study investigated macroseepage, visible seepage, at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, CA. More than 100 samples were collected from individual seeps using stainless steel flux chambers and canisters and were analyzed for methane and C2-C5 alkanes using gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detectors (GC-FID). Maximum hourly fluxes from individual seeps were over 70 g of methane and over 720 mg, 670 mg, 200 mg, 20 mg, 14 mg, and 0.2 mg for ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane respectively. In addition to the active seepage sites, a significant amount of methane and light alkanes was also found to come from outgassing from standing tar deposits. Using gas ratios found in this study along with overall methane emission estimates from another recent study, the La Brea Tar Pits were found to be a significant source of light alkanes in the South Coast Air Basin, contributing approximately 2% towards the overall budget.",

            "abstract": "A large body of work has shown that year-to-year variations in North African dust emission are inversely proportional to previous year monsoon rainfall in the Sahel, implying that African dust emission is highly sensitive to vegetation changes in this narrow transitional zone. However, such a theory is not supported by field observations or modeling studies, as both suggest that interannual variability in dust is due to changes in wind speeds over the major emitting regions, which lie to the north of the Sahelian vegetated zone. Here we reconcile this contradiction showing that interannual variability in Sahelian rainfall, and surface wind speeds over the Sahara, are the result of changes in lower tropospheric air temperatures over the Saharan Heat Low (SHL). As the SHL warms an anomalous tropospheric circulation develops that reduces windspeeds over the Sahara and displaces the monsoonal rainfall northward, thus simultaneously increasing Sahelian rainfall and reducing dust emission from the major dust “hot-spots” in the Sahara. Our results shed light on why climate models are, to-date, unable to reproduce observed historical variability in dust emission and transport from this region.",

            "abstract": "Association with solid-phase iron plays an important role in the accumulation and stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM). Ferric minerals are subject to redox reactions, which can compromise the stability of iron-bound SOM. To date, there is limited information available concerning the fate of iron-bound SOM during redox reactions. In this study, we investigated the release kinetics of hematite-bound organic carbon (OC) during the abiotic reduction of hematite-humic acid (HA) complexes by dithionite, as an analog for the fate of iron-bound SOM in natural redox reactions. Carbon 1s near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy was used to examine the ratio of the aromatic, phenolic and carboxylic/imide functional groups of the adsorbed OC before and after reduction. Our results indicate that the reductive release of iron obeyed first-order kinetics with release rate constants of 6.67×10-3 to 13.0×10-3 min-1. The iron-bound OC was released rapidly during the initial stage with release rate constants of 0.011 to 1.49 min-1, and then became stable with residual fractions of 4.6% to 58.2% between 120 and 240 min. The release rate of aromatic OC was much faster than for the non-aromatic fraction of HA, and 90% of aromatic OC was released within the first hour for most samples. The more rapid release of aromatic OC was attributed to its potential distribution on the outer layer because of steric effects and the possible reduction of quinoids. Our findings show that in the reductive reaction the mobilization of iron-bound organic carbon was asynchronous with the reduction of iron, and aromatic carbon was released more readily than other organic components. This study illustrates the importance of evaluating the stability of iron-bound SOM, especially under aerobic-anaerobic transition conditions.",

            "abstract": "Crustal correction plays an important step in modeling global upper mantle radial anisotropy with surface waves. It has been shown that the choice of the prior crustal model to correct the data can strongly influence the anisotropy model and potentially lead to different geodynamic interpretations. In comparing tomographic models of radial anisotropy obtained from different crustal corrections, previous studies did not, however, determine quantitative model uncertainties. Mantle models resulting from different prior crustal corrections are statistically different only if the posterior model errors stemming from the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem are smaller than the effect of the crustal correction itself. Here, we applied a model space search approach to surface wave phase velocity maps to determine quantitative model uncertainties on seismic velocities and radial anisotropy. We then assessed the significance of the choice of the crustal model by comparing model errors to the differences in mantle structure resulting from different crustal corrections. We tested prior crustal models CRUST2.0, CRUST1.0, and 3SMAC. Our study shows that the use of prior crustal corrections from different crustal models yields significant discrepancies in mantle velocities around 50km depth and in radial anisotropy down to 100km. The effect of the crustal model is most significant in continental regions, which has important consequences for determining the depth of continental roots and understanding continent formation. Our work also demonstrates that the prior crustal model does not significantly affect radial anisotropy and velocities at depths greater than 100km. This implies that if geodynamic interpretations of radial anisotropy below 100km depth were to account for tomographic model uncertainties, they would not depend on the choice of the prior crustal model.",

The tropical cyclone track and data can be obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi. Ionsopheric variations can be monitored from the ground based digisonde located at equatorial station, Trivandrum (8.48oN, 76.95oE), Tirunelveli (8.7oN, 77.8oE) and off equatorial station Allahabad (25.45oN, 81.85oE) and CDAAC COSMIC satellite data.

The convective regions are identified with the help of Outgoing Long wave radiation from NOAA. Gravity wave propagation is mainly depends on the background wind condition, can be examined by using NASA MERRA reanalyses. These Upward propagating gravity waves deposit their energy and momentum into the upper atmosphere as Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs). It is found that the enhancement of this wave activity is increased by orders of 10 at ionospheric level. The Ionospheric variability is measured by examining the variation in the parameters such as, Total Electron Content (TEC), foF2, hmF2, foE, MUF, h’E and h’F.

            "abstract": "In its most simple form the global carbon cycle can be characterized by the response of the land and the ocean carbon components to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the associated climate change. These characterizations are represented in terms of carbon-concentration and carbon-climate feedback parameters and have been used to compare Earth system models with interactive land and ocean carbon cycle components. Of these feedbacks, the response of the land carbon cycle component to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, i.e. the carbon-concentration feedback over land, which is primarily determined by the strength of the terrestrial CO2 fertilization effect, is the most difficult to constrain based on available observations and consequently also the most uncertain across models. Here, we estimate the strength of the terrestrial CO2 fertilization effect in version 4.2 of the Canadian Earth system model that yields best comparison with four observation-based determinants of the global carbon cycle and the historical global carbon budget over the 1850-2005 period. These determinants include 1) globally-averaged atmospheric CO2 concentration, 2) cumulative atmosphere-land CO2 flux, 3) atmosphere-land CO2 flux for the decades of 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and 4) the amplitude of the globally-averaged annual CO2 cycle and its increase over the 1980 to 2005 period. In the simulation that yields best comparison with these determinants, the terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) increases from ~58 Pg C/yr in 1850 to about ~74 Pg C/yr in 2005; an increase of ~27% over the 1850-2005 period.",

On our test site of known hardpan depth (from trenching) and local absence (prior dynamiting to plant trees), we successfully recovered the known edge of a hardpan layer with both methods, ERT and GPR. The clay-rich soil significantly reduced the GPR penetration depth but we still managed to map the edges at a known gap where prior dynamiting had removed the hardpan. Electrical resistivity tomography with a dipole-dipole electrode configuration showed a clear conductive layer at expected depths with a clearly visible gap at the correct location. In our data analysis and representation we only used either freely available or in-house written software.",

            "abstract": "Long Island Sound (LIS) is a tide-dominated estuary located along heavily populated regions on the eastern coast of the US. Western LIS has been impacted by heavy metals and is susceptible to hypoxic and anoxic conditions since the 1900’s. As part of the Long Island Sound Cable Fund and the National Science Foundation programs, we surveyed the western and central regions of LIS in 2006 and 2013, respectively. From the R/V Hugh Sharp and the R/V Seawolf, we collected high-resolution subbottom profiles, multibeam bathymetry, sediment cores, and grabs in distinct sedimentary environments such as channels, terraces, and river mouths. The goal was to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities as they relate to physical processes and populated regions.\nAlong western LIS, total organic carbon (TOC) and heavy metal concentrations are higher from the 1850s to the present, especially along locations of known high organic waste. Pre-industrial concentrations of TOC average 2.22% with maximum values of 4.75%. A similar trend is observed with heavy metals. For example, lead (Pb) increased from background levels of ~10 to 20 ppm to over 200 ppm. Benthic foraminifers seem to be influenced by these trends with changes in ecosystems. The dominant assemblage, Elphidium excavatum clavatum remains dominant with a slight decrease in their abundance during anthropogenic times. From ~1850’s to the present Ammonia beccarii becomes more abundant. These shifts in foraminifer species to assemblages that tolerate low oxygen conditions reflect the increasing hypoxic conditions.\nIn central LIS, surface sediments average TOC of 1.34% with highest values of 5.21% near the Housatonic River that drains industrialized portions of Connecticut, and lowest values of 0.073% near the Long Island coastline. Understanding the evolution of hypoxia as well as the sources of heavy metals can lead to important implications for restoration of marine ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have mapped locations from the magnetic equator to the ionosphere in order to understand how auroral features relate to magnetospheric sources. Vogt et al. (2011) in particular mapped equatorial regions to the ionosphere by using a method of flux equivalence—requiring that the magnetic flux in a specified region at the equator is equal to the magnetic flux in the region to which it maps in the ionosphere. This is preferred to methods relying on tracing field lines from global Jovian magnetic field models, which are inaccurate beyond 30 Jupiter radii from the planet. That previous study produced a two-dimensional model—accounting for changes with radial distance and local time—of the normal component of the magnetic field in the equatorial region. However, this two-dimensional fit—which aggregated all equatorial data from Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Ulysses, and Galileo—did not account for temporal variability resulting from changing solar wind conditions. Building off of that project, this study aims to map the Jovian aurora to the magnetosphere for two separate cases: with a nominal magnetosphere, and with a magnetosphere compressed by high solar wind dynamic pressure. Using the Michigan Solar Wind Model (mSWiM) to predict the solar wind conditions upstream of Jupiter, intervals of high solar wind dynamic pressure were separated from intervals of low solar wind dynamic pressure—thus creating two datasets of magnetometer measurements to be used for two separate 2D fits, and two separate mappings.",

            "abstract": "Flume experiments over the past two decades shed light on the individual roles of vegetation and fine sediment deposition in determining channel pattern. Those modeling encroaching vegetation on self-formed, braided networks demonstrate that enhanced bank strength from root growth limits lateral mobility and encourages flow into fewer channels with lower width to depth ratios. Repeat seedings encourage meandering by strengthening newly-formed bars, thus promoting outer bend migration. Others show that fine sediment deposition can sustain meandering by filling in chute cutoffs and building new floodplain. However, there is more to be learned about transitional phases as vegetation and fines work in tandem to drive morphologic reorganization of braided channel networks.\nWe are conducting a series of flume experiments to investigate the role of fine sediment in the evolution of self-formed, braided channels undergoing repeat seedings of vegetation (Medicago sativa). Flood regime, sediment feed rate, and seeding density are held constant between runs, while sediment size distribution is varied. After generating a braided network, the flume is then re-seeded in between 4-hour floods. Discharge is reduced by 50% during seeding to expose bars, mimicking natural colonization during low flow. Channel migration rate, elevation, depth, and velocity are recorded hourly.\nPreliminary results build upon previous, similarly-scaled experiments that investigated the role of vegetation alone on the self-organization of these systems. Runs without fine sediment lack the ability to deposit in the floodplain, yet enhanced bank strength derived from vegetation lowers channel migration rates, forcing aggradation into narrower channels, and potentially forcing a more avulsive system. We anticipate that further results from upcoming experiments that allow overbank deposition will answer important questions regarding channel aggradation and floodplain formation as channel roughness increases.",

            "abstract": "Drywells are gravity-fed, excavated pits with perforated casings used to facilitate stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge in areas comprised of low permeability soils or cover. Stormwater runoff that would otherwise be routed to streams or drains in urban areas is used as a source of aquifer recharge, potentially mitigating the effects of drought. However, the potential for groundwater contamination caused by urban runoff bypassing surface soil and near surface sediment attenuation processes has prevented more widespread use of drywells as a recharge mechanism. A study is currently underway in Elk Grove, CA, where two drywells have been constructed: one in a preexisting drainage basin fed by residential lots, and one at an industrial site. Both sites are outfitted with one upgradient and two downgradient groundwater monitoring wells, and one vadose zone monitoring well. To assess long-term effects of stormwater infiltration on the surrounding hydrogeologic system, fate and transport models of contaminants in the vadose zone are coupled with groundwater flow models to predict the concentrations of contaminants at the water table and simulate the transport of contaminant plumes to local municipal wells. Results of water quality sampling have identified the local contaminants of interest and the concentrations of these contaminants in the influent stormwater, and the fate and transport of these contaminants have been simulated using a 2D axisymmetrical model with site specific parameters. The output concentrations from vadose zone modeling are used as inputs to simulate contaminant plume migration in groundwater after two, ten, and fifty years. The results of the numerical modeling assessments indicate that the study’s drywells do not pose a long-term threat to groundwater quality and may be an effective source of aquifer recharge and drought mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The Undifferentiated Plains on Titan are vast expanses of terrains that appear radar-dark and fairly uniform in Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and are often referred to as “blandlands”. While the interpretation of several other geologic units on Titan - such as dunes, lakes, and well-preserved impact craters - has been relatively straightforward, the origin of the Undifferentiated Plains has remained elusive. SAR images show that these terrains are mostly found at mid-latitudes and show no major topographic features. Their gradational boundaries and paucity of recognizable features make geologic interpretation challenging. We mapped the distribution of these terrains using SAR swaths up to flyby T92 (7/2013), which cover > 50% of Titan’s surface. We compared SAR images with other data sets, including topography, the response from RADAR radiometry, hyperspectral imaging data from Cassini’s Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), and near infrared imaging from the Imaging Science Subsystem. We examined and evaluated different formation mechanisms, including (i) cryovolcanic origin, consisting of overlapping flows of low relief or (ii) sedimentary origins, resulting from fluvial/lacustrine or aeolian deposition, or accumulation of photolysis products created in the atmosphere. Our results are consistent with a sedimentary origin for the Undifferentiated Plains. We discuss the possible contributing processes (photolysis products, aeolian, and fluvial/lacustrine deposition). VIMS and radiometry analysis of the Undifferentiated Plains presented here is consistent with tholin-like materials as a major component for the materials in the Plains. We conclude that the Undifferentiated Plains are sedimentary in origin and likely formed by a combination of aeolian, fluvial and lacustrine deposition, together with atmospheric organic particle deposition, possibly in differing proportions depending on location.",

            "abstract": "Upper-crustal magma reservoirs are important sites of magma mixing, crustal refining, and magma storage. Crystals residing in these reservoirs have been shown to represent valuable archives of the chemical and physical evolution of reservoirs, and the time scales of this evolution. This presentation addresses the question of “What do crystals “see” and record about processes within the upper crust? And how is that view similar or different between plutonic and volcanic records?” Three general observations emerge from study of the ages of crystals, combined with crystal-scale geochemical data: 1) Patterns of isotopic and trace-element data over time in zircon crystals from a given magmatic system (e.g., Yellowstone, WY, and Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand) can show systematic changes in the degree of heterogeneity, consistent with extraction of melts from a long-lived (up to 100s of kyr), heterogeneous crystal mush and in some cases continued crystallization and homogenization of the magma during a short period (< a few kyr) preceding eruption. 2) Thermal histories of magma storage derived from crystal records also show that the vast majority of time recorded by major phases was spent in storage as a crystal mush, perhaps at near-solidus conditions. 3) Comparison of ages of accessory phases in both plutonic blocks and host magmas that brought them to the surface do not show a consistent relationship between the two. In some cases, zircons from plutonic blocks have age spectra much older than zircon in the host magma. In other cases, host and plutonic block zircons have similar age spectra and chemical characteristics, suggesting a closer genetic connection between the two. These observations suggest that crystals in plutonic bodies, if examined at similar spatial and temporal scales to those in volcanic rocks, would show records that are highly heterogeneous in chemistry and age on the scale of a pluton or a lobe of a pluton, but that local regions of limited chemical and age variability may be preserved as remnants of the melt extraction and amalgamation process.",

To capitalize on this informal educational outlet, the Arctic Institute of North America partnered with the International Arctic Research Center, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the UA Museum of the North to develop a podcast series called PoLAR Voices for the Polar Learning and Responding (PoLAR) Climate Change Education Partnership. PoLAR Voices is a public education initiative that uses creative storytelling and novel narrative structures to immerse the listener in an auditory depiction of climate change. The programs will feature the science and story of climate change, approaching topics from both the points of view of researchers and Arctic indigenous peoples. This approach will engage the listener in the holistic story of climate change, addressing both scientific and personal perspectives, resulting in a program that is at once educational, entertaining and accessible. Feedback is being collected at each stage of development to ensure the content and format of the program satisfies listener interests and preferences. Once complete, the series will be released on thepolarhub.org and on iTunes. Additionally, blanket distribution of the programs will be accomplished via radio broadcast in urban, rural and remote areas, and in multiple languages to increase distribution and enhance accessibility.",

These observations show that Alaska’s regional mass balance is -75+11/-16 Gt yr-1 (1994-2013) (Larsen et al., 2015). A surprising result is that the rate of surface mass loss observed on non-tidewater glaciers in Alaska is extremely high. At these rates, Alaska contributes ~1 mm to global sea level rise every 5 years. Given the present lack of adequate satellite resources, Operation IceBridge airborne surveys by UAF are the most effective and efficient method to monitor this region’s impact on global sea level rise. Ice depth measurements using radar sounding have been part of these airborne surveys since 2012. Many of Alaska’s tidewater glaciers are bedded significantly below sea level. The depth and extent of glacier beds below sea level are critical factors in the dynamics of tidewater retreat. Improved radar processing tools are being used to predict clutter using forward simulation. This is essential to properly sort out true bed returns, which are often masked or obscured by valley wall returns. This presentation will provide an overview of the program, highlighting recent findings and observations from the most recent campaigns, and focusing on techniques used for the extrapolation of surface elevation changes to regional mass balances.",

However, scant information is available for the role of pyrogenic carbon in the redox cycle of iron. Herein, we studied the influences of wheat straw-derived biochar on the microbial reduction of hematite by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. In the presence of 10 mg/L biochar, microbial reduction of hematite was substantially accelerated by 41% to 142%. Reduction of hematite was enhanced to similar degrees by aqueous biochar with the concentration of 1-3 mg C/L. Importance of the aqueous biochar was also supported by the response of enhancement of Fe reduction to the dose of biochar particles, closely linked to the change in aqueous biochar concentration rather than the amount of total biochar particles. Microbiologically pre-reduced biochar reduced hematite abiotically, demonstrating the electron shuttling capacity of aqueous biochar for hematite reduction. On the other side, biochar particles sorbed Fe(II) and consequently decreased the accumulation of Fe(II) in solution to facilitate the reduction of hematite further. We reported for the first time the biochar-facilitated microbial reduction of crystalline Fe(III), through electron shuttling processes mediated by aqueous biochar and complexation of Fe(II) by biochar particles. Such impacted redox cycles of Fe would be important for the soil environment with relatively high content of indigenous pyrogenic carbon or substantial application of biochar.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions are most deadly when highly mobile pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) sweep down mountain flanks after eruption columns or lava domes collapse. An important goal in volcanic hazard assessment is to predict the velocity of PDCs in numerical hazard models. To date, this has only been partially successful for dilute PDCs, and major uncertainties remain with regard to the dynamics of PDCs that have coupled dense underflow and dilute ash-cloud regions. Interrogating these complex multiphase processes is only practical in the laboratory, but this introduces the problem of scale where it is difficult to minimise the boundary layer effects which, in small flows, can dominate behaviour. To bridge the gap, we synthesized large-scale PDCs by gravitational collapse of 1300 kg of a natural pyroclastic mixture and examined flow front velocity fields on inclined slopes.\nWe show that, proximally, PDCs experience rapid expulsion of gas that entrains particles and yields a fast-moving turbulent and dilute cloud that becomes the flow head and moves at 200-250% of the impact velocity. Downstream, the turbulent cloud moves ahead of the underflow. We show that the velocity-dependent friction coefficient (which represents the major dissipative form of energy) directly relates to the kinematics of the underflow front. In experimental situations where the dilute flow front velocity exceeds at all times the underflow velocity, we propose a new analytical model to quantify the asymptotic waning of the flow front velocity with distance. Using measurements of the flow head geometry and density, we show that our model successfully predicts the flow front kinematics including a long-lasting period of deceleration. Importantly, the interplay between the turbulent flow front and the presence of an underflow leads to the formation of a wedge-shaped head characterized by unexpectedly high coefficients of entrainment of ambient air.",

Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenically produced CO2 has resulted in an increase in global temperatures and a decline in the mean pH of the world’s oceans. The California Current System is a particularly susceptible region to ocean acidification due to natural upwelling processes that also cause a reduction in seawater pH. The trace element concentration of magnesium and boron in planktonic foraminiferal shells are used here as proxies for temperature and carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]), respectively. Newly developed calibrations relating Mg/Ca ratios to temperature (R2 0.91) and B/Ca ratios to [CO32-] (R2 0.84) for the surface-mixed layer species Globogerina bulloides were generated using material collected in the Santa Barbara Basin sediment trap time-series. Using these empirical relationships, temperature and [CO32-] are reconstructed using a 0.5 meter long multi-core collected within the basin. 210Pb activities were used to determine a sedimentation rate for the core to estimate ages for core samples (sedimentation rate: 0.341 cm/yr). A spike in 137Cs activity is used as a tie-point to the year 1965 coinciding with the peak of nuclear bomb testing. Our down-core record extends through the mid-19th century to create a history of rising sea surface temperatures and declining [CO32-] as a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "The surface emissions of atmospheric compounds have changed dramatically in many world regions during the past decades. We will evaluate these changes through an analysis of different global and regional anthropogenic emissions inventories, focusing on several megacities. In European and North American megacities, surface emissions of chemical compounds have decreased significantly, while they have increased in many other megacities in different parts of the world.\nSimulations performed with the CAM4-Chem Community Earth System Model will be used to evaluate the impact of the changes in emissions on the distributions chemical compounds in different megacities. These simulations were performed as part of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI), a project of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC). The analysis of the simulations will focus more particularly on nitrogen dioxide: this species has been observed by satellite measurements since the late 1990s. Model results and satellite observations will be analysed for everal megacities in Europe and North America, where strong emission controls have been implemented. Other megacities in China, India, Africa and South America, where few emission regulations have been enforced have seen large increases in their emissions: we will evaluate the consistency of the model simulations and satellite observations of NO2 in these cities.",

            "abstract": "The motions of Earth’s tectonic plates are typically measured in millimeters to tens of centimeters per year, seemingly confirming the generally-held view that tectonic processes are slow, and have been throughout Earth’s history. In line with this perspective, the vast majority of laboratory rock mechanics research focused on failure in the brittle regime has been limited to experiments utilizing slow loading rates. On the other hand, many natural processes that pose significant risk for humans (e.g., earthquakes and extraterrestrial impacts), as well as risks associated with human activities (blow-outs, explosions, mining and mine failures, projectile penetration), occur at rates that are hundreds to thousands of times faster than those typically simulated in the laboratory. Little experimental data exists to confirm or calibrate theoretical models explaining the connection between these dramatic events and the pulverized rocks found in fault zones, impacts, or explosions; however the experimental data that does exist is thought-provoking: At the earth’s surface, the process of brittle fracture passes through a critical transition in rocks at high strain rates (101-103s-1) between regimes of discrete fracture and distributed fragmentation, accompanied by a dramatic increase in strength. Previous experimental works on this topic have focused on key thresholds (e.g., peak stress, peak strain, average strain rate) that define this transition, but more recent work suggests that this transition is more fundamentally dependent on characteristics (e.g., shape) of the loading pulse and related microcrack dynamics, perhaps explaining why for different lithologies different thresholds more effectively define the pulverization transition. In this presentation we summarize some of our work focused on this transition, including the evolution of individual defects at the microscopic, microsecond scale and the energy budget associated with the brittle fragmentation process as a function of lithology and loading pulse characteristics.",

Previous experimental studies sought to test this functional dependence under quasi-equilibrium conditions (assumed static on the imaging time-scale); however, applying predictive models developed under static conditions for dynamic scenarios can lead to substantial flaws in predicted outcomes. Theory and models developed using dynamic data can be verified using fast x-ray microtomography which allows for the unprecedented measurement of developing interfacial areas, curvatures, and trapping behaviors of fluid phases in three-dimensional systems. We will present results of drainage and imbibition experiments of air and water within a mixture of glass beads. The experiments were performed under both quasi-equilibrium and dynamic conditions at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Fast x-ray microtomography was achieved by utilizing the high brilliance of the x-ray beam at the APS under pink-beam conditions where the white beam is modified with a 4 mm Al absorber and a 0.8 mrad Pt-coated mirror to eliminate low and high-energy photons, respectively. We present a comparison of the results from the quasi-equilibrium and dynamic experiments in an effort to determine if the Pc-Sw-Anw relationship is comparable under either experimental condition and to add to the discussion on whether the Pc-Sw-Anw relationship is unique as hypothesized by existing theory.",

            "abstract": "Rockfalls are an important hillslope process operating at bedrock locations on mountain landscapes. Rockfall erosion and deposition may: (i) contribute to geomorphic modification and weathering (ii) dominate low-order catchments and affect connectivity between hillslopes and stream channels (iii) affect mountain hydrology. Prior studies have shown that rockfall occurrence in alpine environments is controlled by factors such as joint frequency/width, frost cracking, glacial history and seismic activity. Further work is required to better understand regional controls on rockfall events in the Canadian Rockies. Extensive glaciation in these landscapes resulted in oversteepened hillslopes that were susceptible to rockfall activity, particularly during the paraglacial period, but with activity continuing until present day. Herein, we investigate large-scale controls in rockfall-talus process-response systems in the Front Ranges and Main Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. Structural geology and climate differ between these two regions. Our study area includes drainage basins covering a total of ~1,000 km2 in Kananaskis Country (Front Ranges) and Kootenay National Park (Main Ranges). Talus inventories are collected from aerial photographs to analyze rockfall-talus process-response systems in the Front and Main Ranges. Talus deposits represent accumulation over millennial temporal scales and are used to evaluate long-term rockfall erosion rates. Preliminary results suggest differences in rockfall-talus processes between the two study areas. The Main Ranges are less deformed and have horizontal bedding relative to the Front Ranges which have a combination of gently and steeply dipping slopes. These differences in bedding planes may produce distinct distributions of rockfall-talus systems in each region. Other factors will be investigated, such as glacial sculpting, jointing patterns and amount of time that rock is in the frost cracking temperature window (-3 to -8 0C).",

            "abstract": "It is essential for an accurate simulation of air pollutions to have a good representation of the cloud system, because it strongly affects the distribution of air pollutions through its physical processes. For this problem, the global atmospheric chemistry model coupled to the high-resolution non-hydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model (NICAM-Chem) was developed and evaluated. Previously, using the model with a regionally enhanced grid spacing of 10km, we assessed the amount of aerosol distributions in August over the East Asia. In this time, we applied the model with the global quasi-uniform grid spacing of 14km resolution in different seasons using the K-supercomputer system (proposal numbers 140046 and 150156).\nFor the presentation, the month-long simulations in four different months (January, April, July, and October) are performed. The seasonal variations of the NICAM-Chem simulated global aerosol distributions as well as the cloud/precipitation fields are compared with in-situ measurements (AERONET) and satellite observations (e.g., MODIS). As a result, we find that the results simulated by NICAM-Chem are generally comparable to those obtained by the observations.",

            "abstract": "The Nikolai Basalt and related mafic to ultramafic intrusions are one of the world’s most complete and best exposed sections of a large igneous province (Amphitheater Mountains, Alaska), and have been explored for magmatic Ni-Cu-Co-PGE mineralization (Wellgreen deposit in the Kluane Ranges, Yukon Territory, and Eureka zone in the Eastern Alaska Range). The full extent of the basalts and the intrusions, as well as along-strike variations in the geochemical and petrological composition and the causes for those variations has yet to be fully established. To better understand the extent and magmatic architecture of this system, the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys conducted mapping and geochemical investigations of the province from 2013 through 2015 field seasons.\nWe present major and trace element data from whole rock, olivine, and chromite from samples of Triassic basalts and intrusives collected over a 250 km along-strike transect. This data is used to answer questions about variations in magma generation, temperature of crystallization, and degree of fractional crystallization required to produce the Nikolai Basalts. Using chalcophile elements, we examine the history of sulfide solubility, further adding to our understanding of the processes of magma evolution and its influence on the formation of economic mineral deposits. Our initial findings corroborate the presence of two phases of magma generation and eruption, as well as along-strike variation in composition of these phases. We propose that the major along-strike variations are due to differences in amount of cumulate olivine and other late-stage processes. This magmatic architecture has important implications for exploration for magmatic sulfide deposits of nickel-copper and strategic and critical platinum group elements (PGEs) as it can help to better understand the occurrences and point to future possible deposits within the system.",

            "abstract": "Saltwater intrusion has become a significant problem for many coastal rivers due to global climate change and the continuous sea level rise. The flocculation of dissolved metals during estuarine mixing plays a critical role in self-purification of metals. A number of studies have investigated pH and salinity effects on metal mobility. Many of these studies were conducted in a laboratory setting. The reported field studies considered only few metals and their dynamics under marginal pH / salinity variation, typically over a short period of time. Since the spring of 2013, we have been conducting a study on spatiotemporal distribution of metals along a 90-km reach of the Calcasieu River estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Monthly field trips were made to conduct in-situ measurements and collect water samples at six sites along the river. In addition, sediment samples from the riverbed surface were collected at the same sites four times to assess metal accumulation. Field measurements included water temperature, pH, salinity, and specific conductivity; Water samples were analyzed for concentration of a range of metals including Al, Ba, B, Cd, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, K, Si, Ag, Na, Sr, Ti, V, and Zn. The estuarine river reach showed a wide range of salinity and pH (salinity: 0.04 - 21.78 ppt; pH: 6.2-8.1), strongly affected by river hydrology and tidal mixing. Concentration and spatial distribution of the metals in river water show response to flow regimes from the low (400 cfs) to the intermediate (400-2600 cfs) and high flows. This paper presents the dynamics of the metals under varying flow, pH and salinity gradients over the seasons and discusses a potential “intrusion” of metal accumulation in riverbed upstream as sea level rise persists.",

            "abstract": "The rapid deployment of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies enabled the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America. Global deployment of these advanced gas production technologies could bring large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources to the energy system. It has been hoped that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which in turn could reduce climate forcing. Other researchers countered that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal. In this study, we employ five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models (IAMs) of energy-economy-climate systems to assess the full impact of abundant gas on climate change. The models show large additional natural gas consumption up to +170% by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2% to +11%), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3% to +7%) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that while globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy market equilibrium, it will not significantly mitigate climate change on its own in the absence of climate policies.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions are known to be a significant geohazard, but post- or inter-eruptive processes (such as lahars, landslides, and debris avalanches) can be equally damaging to local and regional areas by remobilizing deposits. Numerous studies have found that soluble salts bound to ash grain surfaces may be quickly released into exposed waters, often lowering pH and adding trace metals with both beneficial and deleterious effects on marine flora and fauna (e.g., Fe influx initiating blooms of marine phytoplankton). Most of the cation content of pyroclastic deposits is released slowly into the environment through weathering and alteration processes. However, other pathways exist through the physical comminution of pyroclasts in fluvial and marine settings. In this case, mechanical fracturing of pyroclasts during progressive stages of disaggregation will lead to exposure of reactive particle surfaces. This study evaluates the potential, ongoing effects on water quality by experimental, mechanical milling of pyroclasts and the evaluation of released metals into exposed waters using the pyroclastic density current deposits of both the 2010 eruption of Merapi and the 2014 eruption of Kelud (Java, Indonesia), which have a bulk basaltic andesite/andesite composition (60-65 wt% SiO2). The electrical conductivity (EC) of water samples positively correlates with Ca and Sr concentrations in the case of bulk ash, whole, and crushed lapilli, but correlates with Na for the milled samples. Compared to other stages of pyroclast disaggregation, milled lapilli have the greatest effect on the concentration of alkali elements and produce a significant increase in Ca, Na, K, and Si. Mechanical milling of pyroclasts grinds down minerals and glass, resulting in an increased EC, pH, and Na concentration of exposed waters. Similar experiments are currently being conducted using basalt (50 wt% SiO2) and rhyolite (70 wt% SiO2) deposits, and these results will be presented. Mechanical milling of volcanic deposits may occur during transport of lahars, submarine landslides, or debris avalanches, sometimes decades or centuries after the initial eruptive activity, providing a sudden input of elements into marine environments that can affect a range of flora and fauna.",

Some folds in the beds in the Misaki and Shiramazu Formations of middle Miocene to early Pliocene and early Pleistocene age respectively explain long distant layer-parallel slip made of many small scale (tens of cm order) duplex structures of antiformal stack or hinterland-dipping type, or both. The duplexed layer parts are unconformably overlain by liquefied or fluidized turbidite layers on top, suggesting very shallow burial depths during deformation or duplication as slide or slump deposits. Some blocks of hinterland-dipping type duplexes are involved in breccia beds that are formed by liquefaction or mud diapiric intrusion. In addition, in the Misaki Formations, large scale duplex structures of hinterland-dipping type with bi-divergent thrust system on orders of hundreds of meters are mapped in stratified layers. Those duplex systems of various scales are a type of fault-bend fold that is characterized by layer parallel slip within a single, specific bed, that then propagated upward to slip again within the other specific bed. Many of the examples of fault-bend folds formed at shallow burial depths, probably just after the deposition. Another type of layer parallel shortening in the Misaki and Shiramazu Formations is fault-propagation folds that are characterized by propagation of thrust faults by forming synclines and anticlines, resulting in an upward concave thrust system that splays out from the basal slip to develop. These two different types of folds are developed within layers in one side, and in another side cutting through the layers, and could be applied to the submarine Nankai prism of the same ages.",

            "abstract": "Missing emission sources contribute to potential problems in air quality modeling and human health. Low Vapor Pressure-Volatile Organic Compounds (LVP-VOCs) are widely used in consumer products and currently receive VOC exemptions based on their vapor pressure. However, 58.5 TPD LVP-VOC is estimated to emit in 2020 from consumer products in California based on government and industry inventory data. This work investigates the emission and photochemical evolution of major LVP-VOCs in consumer products to demonstrate LVP-VOC impacts on criteria air pollutants. LVP-VOC emission potential is investigated by offline gravimetric and online headspace tracking pure compounds and consumer product mixtures under ambient relevant conditions. Only 3 of the 14 pure LVP-VOCs were found to be atmospherically unavailable. All target LVP-VOCs are observed to evaporate from tested consumer product mixtures. We found improved thermodynamic parameters to predict LVP-VOC evaporation rate. LVP-VOCs photochemical evolution and their impact on ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation are evaluated by integrating SAPRC-11 modeling with laboratory studies in a 90 m3 dual environmental chamber at UC Riverside/CE-CERT. Simultaneous photooxidation experiments, with and without the LVP-VOC, are conducted in the presence of reactive organic gas (ROG) surrogate representing urban chemical smog. Further, LVP-VOC photochemical evolution pathway is investigated under various atmospheric activity (LVP + H2O2, LVP+NO or LVP+H2O2+NO) in the environmental chamber. Gas phase and particle phase mass spectrometers (SIFT-MS, Selected Ion Flow Tube-Mass Spectrum and HR-ToF-MS, High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol mass Spectrometer) are applied to monitor the evolution of LVP-VOCs in the controlled atmosphere. The potential of LVP-VOC oxidation into ELVOC is also illustrated. We finally interpret the health risk and environmental concern related to LVP-VOC emission and photoxidation.",

            "abstract": "An approach is developed for mapping large-scale magnetic field lines between the Sun and Earth near the solar equatorial plane, using near-Earth observations and a solar wind model with nonzero azimuthal magnetic field at the source surface. Unlike Parker's original solar wind model which is intrinsically limited in magnetic azimuthal angle and predicts open spiral field lines only, our approach can predict all the observed magnetic azimuthal angles and can predict both open field lines and magnetic loops. The predicted maps show that near both solar minimum and solar maximum the field lines are typically open, and that loops with both ends either connected to or disconnected from the Sun are relatively rare. The open field lines, nonetheless, often do not closely follow the Parker spiral, being less or more tightly wound or strongly azimuthally or radially oriented, or having inversions. The time-varying classes (e.g., bidirectional electrons) of suprathermal (strahl) electron pitch angle distributions at 1 AU are predicted from the configurations of mapped field lines and compared with Wind observations for two solar rotations, one each near solar minimum and solar maximum. The predictions of our approach are shown to agree quantitatively (~90%) with the observations and to outperform (by ~20%) the predictions of the Parker spiral model. The magnetic mapping developed here should be important for understanding the connectivity to Earth of suprathermal particles of solar origin, e.g., solar energetic particles and beam electrons in type III solar radio bursts.",

            "abstract": "Soil oxygen (O2) availability and associated redox dynamics are key drivers of carbon and nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in terrestrial ecosystems. However, few studies have measured soil O2 availability, and even fewer have related this to biogeochemical cycling over space and time. Redox dynamics are likely to play a particularly important role in humid tropical forests characterized by high rainfall, near constant warm temperatures, high biological activity, and finely textured soils, all of which contribute to periodic O2 depletion throughout the soil profile. These ecosystems exhibit rapid C turnover and are a globally important source of the major greenhouse gases. We report on an extensive network of galvanic O2 sensors and time-domain reﬂectometry along topographic gradients in a lower montane wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico (n = 105 sensors). Within the sensor field we also installed three automated surface flux chambers in each topographic zone (ridge, slope and valley). A Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) gas analyzer was used to measure pseudo-continuous fluxes of CO2, N2O, and CH4. Soil O2 concentrations decrease nonlinearly from ridges to valleys along topographic gradients. Soil moisture was the best single predictor of soil O2 concentrations explaining over 50% of the variability in the data, even in these well-drained soils. Drought conditions dramatically altered soil O2 dynamics in both time and space, and showed that redox drivers differed by topographic position. Both ridges and slopes produced higher CO2 fluxes than valleys. Daily CH4 emissions went up to ~2000 g CH4 ha-1d-1 for valleys (hot spots and hot moments). Soil O2 dynamics also helped explain patterns in reactive Fe species and C storage, as well as pH along the catena. Our results highlight the potential for soil O2 concentrations as an integrator of biogeochemical dynamics in variable redox environments. They also provide a mechanism for identifying and exploring the role of hot spots and hot moments in space and time.",

            "abstract": "Crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs) within a natural peridotite commonly consist three pole figures for [100], [010] and [001] axes and are categorized into the well-known five olivine fabric types: A, B, C, D and E, which are easily connected with olivine slip systems: A as (010)[100], B as (010)[001], C as (001)[001], D as {0kl}[100] and E as (001)[100]. The five fabric types have been discussed on flow stress, water contents and pressure effect in mantle. In addition, AG type has also been proposed in recognition of its common occurrence in nature. The development of AG-type is not clear and could require some factors such as complex slip systems, non-coaxial strain types or the effect of melt during plastic flow. Here, we present our olivine fabric database mainly for the convergent margin in the western Pacific region. We introduce a new index named fabric-index angle (FIA) related to P-wave property of a single olivine crystal instead of a tentative classification of CPOs into the six fabric types, so that a set of CPOs can be expressed as a single angle in a range between -90° and 180°. The six olivine fabric types can have unique FIA: 63° for A type, -28° for B type, 158° for C type, 90° for D type, 106° for E type and 0° for AG type. We divided our olivine database into five tectonic groups: ophiolites, ridge peridotites, trench peridotites, peridotite xenoliths and peridotites enclosed in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. Our result shows that although our database is not yet large enough except the trench peridotites to define the characteristic of the five tectonic groups, the natural olivine fabrics vary in a range of the FIA: 0° to 150° for the ophiolites, 40° to 80° for the ridge peridotites, -40° to 100° for the trench peridotites, 0° to 100° for the peridotite xenoliths and -40° to 10° for the peridotites enclosed in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. The trench peridotites show statistically bimodal distribution of FIA consisting of the high peak equivalent to A type and the low peak of FIA close to AG type. The variation of the olivine fabrics in the trench peridotites could result from variation of strain types in the supra-subduction uppermost mantle related to the mantle evolution during the subduction initiation of the Pacific plate.",

            "abstract": "Meeting increasing global food demands while fostering environmental sustainability requires a detailed understanding of the drivers of yield sensitivity within agroecosystems. In this study, we untangle the roles of soil texture and shallow groundwater as simultaneous drivers of corn yield resistance to excessively wet and dry growing seasons. Specifically, we ask (1) does the presence of groundwater in or near the root zone increase/decrease yield?; and (2) how does yield response to water table depth interact with variability in soil texture and growing season weather conditions? We combine a multi-year field study at a commercial corn field in south-central Wisconsin with ecohydrological modeling using AgroIBIS-VSF to assess the yield response to a broad spectrum of groundwater, soil, and weather conditions. We find that shallow groundwater (<1 m) increases yield sensitivity to overly wet growing season conditions, but acts as a stable reservoir of water to increase drought resistance by providing a groundwater yield subsidy during dry years. Modeling results indicate that coarser soils receive a groundwater yield subsidy at shallower water table depths than finer-grained soils, and that the magnitude of the groundwater yield subsidy tends to be larger. We also find that crops growing on soils with different textures experience a comparable response to changes in growing season precipitation and evapotranspiration demands. Overall, we find that the benefits of shallow groundwater (drought resistance) outweigh the negatives (waterlogging and yield loss) at our study site.",

            "abstract": "Empirical models have been widely used to estimate global chlorophyll content from remotely sensed data. Here, we focus on the standard NASA empirical models that use blue-green band ratios. These band ratio ocean color (OC) algorithms are in the form of fourth-order polynomials and the parameters of these polynomials (i.e. coefficients) are estimated from the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Most of the points in this data set have been sampled from tropical and temperate regions. However, polynomial coefficients obtained from this data set are used to estimate chlorophyll content in all ocean regions with different properties such as sea-surface temperature, salinity, and downwelling/upwelling patterns. Further, the polynomial terms in these models are highly correlated. In sum, the limitations of these empirical models are as follows: 1) the independent variables within the empirical models, in their current form, are correlated (multicollinear), and 2) current algorithms are global approaches and are based on the spatial stationarity assumption, so they are independent of location. Multicollinearity problem is resolved by using partial least squares (PLS). PLS, which transforms the data into a set of independent components, can be considered as a combined form of principal component regression (PCR) and multiple regression. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is also used to investigate the validity of spatial stationarity assumption. GWR solves a regression model over each sample point by using the observations within its neighbourhood. PLS results show that the empirical method underestimates chlorophyll content in high latitudes, including the Southern Ocean region, when compared to PLS (see Figure 1). Cluster analysis of GWR coefficients also shows that the spatial stationarity assumption in empirical models is not likely a valid assumption.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and ozone depleting substance. Due to a high degree of both spatial and temporal variability coupled with limited availability of high-precision N2O sensors, emissions of N2O are difficult to quantify at the regional and field levels, scales important for determining best management practices. This study combined the use of automated static chambers and the flux gradient micrometeorological technique to continuously monitor emissions of N2O over two canola fields with differing tillage management: no-tillage and conventional tillage. Each site was instrumented with an array of sixteen chambers for the entire 2015 crop year (1 Oct – 30 Sept), and the N2O emissions were measured with the flux gradient method from 1 April thru 30 September.\nThe chamber measurements indicated cumulative annual emissions of 6.0 and 3.1 kg N2O-N ha-1 for the conventional tillage and no-tillage sites, respectively, or 4.8% and 2.5% of applied fertilizer N. Emissions at the conventional tillage site were very low until the field was planted and fertilized, when emissions increased dramatically and stayed high until crop senesce. The growing season (1 April – June 15) accounted for 80% of total measured N2O losses (4.8 kg N2O-N ha-1). In contrast, the no-till site was characterized by consistent moderate emissions, and no spike after planting and fertilization was observed. The growing season only accounted for 30% of the total emissions (1.0 kg N2O-N ha-1). However, even sixteen chambers may not properly capture hot spots of emissions, and the spatially integrated flux gradient results did not corroborate the chamber results. The total emissions measured by the flux gradient method over the growing season were 1.6 and 1.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 for the conventional tillage and no-till sites, respectively. Further work on integrating the two techniques will be necessary to optimize characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of N2O emissions in this region.",

The geological structure is complicated and volcanic activity is strong. In this region, two major geologic and geophysical boundaries are distinct, the NNE-trending North South Gravity Lineament (NSGL) and Tanlu fault. With respect to North China Craton (NCC), Northeast China is more closely adjacent to the subduction zone of Pacific slab, along the eastern boundary of Northeast China the subducting Pacific plate approaches depths of 600 km, many deep earthquakes occurred here. This region becomes an ideal place to investigate deep structure related to deep subduction, deep earthquakes as well as intraplate volcanism. In this study, we determined high-resolution three dimensional P- and S-wave velocity models of the crust and upper mantle to 800 km depth by jointly inverting arrival times from local events and relative residuals from teleseismic events. Our results show that main velocity anomalies exhibited block feature and are generally oriented in NE to NNE direction, which is consistent with regional tectonic direction. The NSGL is characterized by a high-velocity (high-V) anomaly belt with a width of approximately 100 km, and the high-V anomaly extents to the bottom of upper mantle or mantle transition zone. The songliao basin, which is located between NSGL and Tanlu fault tectonic boundaries, obvious low-velocity anomaly extends to about depth of 200 km. Under the Great Xing’an Range on the west side of NSGL, the low velocity extend to the lithosphere. Our results also revealed that most of deep earthquakes all occurred in deep subduction zone with high-velocity anomaly. Further, we also observed that extensive low velocity exists above deep-earthquakes zones, this result suggests that deep subduction of the Pacific slab maybe affect overlying lithosphere, resulting in the state of molten, semi-molten or high water.",

            "abstract": "How the intangible convective envelope of the MJO is made up of organized deep convection has been of particular interest, because it is the key to understand the physics and dynamics of the MJO from the viewpoint of multiscale interactions. We explored the multiscale convective structure of the MJO using 30-year (1983.7-2013) high-resolution satellite date taking advantage of the spatio-temporal wavelet transform (STWT), which is able to localize the space-time spectral characteristics of cloudiness in both space and time. Namely, the multiscale structure of the MJO can be interpreted in terms of a sum of a variety of so-called convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs). It is found that a range of CCEWs tend to be enhanced in the MJO convective envelope, whereas the types of CCEWs with characteristic space-time scales vary seasonally, geographically, and even from event to event. It is thus difficult to find a universal multiscale structure of the MJO, although there is a tendency for the MJO to prefer certain types of CCEWs including Kelvin waves and n=1 westward inertio-gravity (WIG) waves. Within the MJO convective envelope, those waves tend to be enhanced by as large as 100 % compared to the climatological values and Kelvin waves tend to have much slower phase speed of about 9 m s-1 or less (i.e., equivalent depth of ~8 m) as opposed to the climatological mean values (equivalent depths of 25-90 m) and n=1 WIG waves tend to have 2 day periodicity. Such strong modulation effect, however, is less pronounced over the Maritime continent. The historical database we created will be useful to place the convective systems of the MJO during the CINDY/DYNAMO and the future YMC field campaigns in the historical context.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires have potential to significantly alter soil properties and vegetation within watersheds. These alterations often contribute to accelerated erosion, runoff, and sediment transport in stream channels and hillslopes. This research applies repeated Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to stream reaches within the Pike National Forest in Colorado following the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire. These scans allow investigation of the relationship between sediment delivery and environmental characteristics such as precipitation, soil burn severity, and vegetation. Post-fire LiDAR images provide high resolution information of stream channel changes in eight reaches for three years (2012-2014). All images are processed with RiSCAN PRO to remove vegetation and triangulated and smoothed to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 0.1 m resolution. Study reaches with two or more successive DEM images are compared using a differencing method to estimate the volume of sediment erosion and deposition. Preliminary analysis of four channel reaches within Williams Canyon and Camp Creek yielded erosion estimates between 0.035 and 0.618 m3 per unit area. Deposition was estimated as 0.365 to 1.67 m3 per unit area. Reaches that experienced higher soil burn severity or larger rainfall events produced the greatest geomorphic changes. Results from LiDAR analyses can be incorporated into post-fire hydrologic models to improve estimates of runoff and sediment yield. These models will, in turn, provide guidance for water resources management and downstream hazards mitigation.",

The SIP (ca 560-570 Ma) is located within the Kalak Nappe Complex, a part of the Middle Allochthon of the North Norwegian Caledonides.\nReinfjord is one of the ultramafic complexes of the SIP. It was emplaced during three magmatic events in a time span of 4 Ma and consists in a cylindrically zoned complex with a dunite core (Central Series) surrounded by wehrlite, lherzolite and olivine-rich pyroxenite dominated series (Upper and Lower Layered Series). Olivine cumulates with various amounts of pyroxenes (mostly clinopyroxenes) compose the main lithological units of the intrusion.\nLayered gabbros and sedimentary garnet gneiss hosting the intrusion are respectively found mainly on eastern/southern and western sides of the ultramafic complex.\nWithin the Reinfjord complex is a promising Ni-Cu-and a PGE reef deposit of high economic interest.\nHigh-resolution aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys were completed in 2014 in Reinfjord.\nHere, we developed a magnetic model for the Reinfjord complex integrating petrophysical data (density, magnetic) from samples collected in the field (2014/15) and 4 drill cores (up to 390m) with ground magnetic and helicopter data (SkyTEM survey). The magnetic data have been processed and both measured TMI and calculated vertical gradients data have been used for modelling.\nThe combination of different datasets and the petrophysical properties for surface and core samples allowed the estimation of the geometry, depth and magnetisation of the magnetic sources contributing to, and refining the geological interpretation of the Reinfjord ultramafic intrusion. A 3D model (Model Vision) of the geometry of the ultramafic intrusion is presented.",

A global high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model with grid size about 20 km is used to project future changes in rainfall extremes associated with El Nino at the end of the 21st century. Four different spatial patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) changes are used as future boundary conditions based on the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario. Rainfall extremes such as the maximum 5-day precipitation total (Rx5d) over the western Pacific are positively correlated to the Nino3.4 SST anomalies. It is found that Rx5d regressed to the Nino3.4 SST will increase two times in the future compared to the present value. This implies drastic increase of risk of heavy-rainfall induced disasters under by global warming over the western Pacific countries.",

            "abstract": "Hot channels (HCs), high-temperature erupting structures in the lower corona of the Sun, have been proposed as a proxy of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) since their initial discovery. However, it is difficult to provide definitive proof given the fact that there is no direct measurement of the magnetic field in the corona. An alternative method is to use the magnetic field measurement in the solar wind from in situ instruments. On 2012 July 12, an HC was observed prior to and during a coronal mass ejection (CME) by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly high-temperature images. The HC is invisible in the EUVI low-temperature images, which only show the cooler leading front (LF). However, both the LF and an ejecta can be observed in the coronagraphic images. These are consistent with the high temperature and high density of the HC and support that the ejecta is the erupted HC. Meanwhile, the associated CME shock was identified ahead of the ejecta and the sheath through the COR2 images, and the corresponding ICME was detected by the Advanced Composition Explorer, showing the shock, sheath, and magnetic cloud (MC) sequentially, which agrees with the coronagraphic observations. Further, the MC average Fe charge state is elevated, containing a relatively low-ionization-state center and a high-ionization-state shell, consistent with the preexisting HC observation and its growth through magnetic reconnection. All of these observations support that the MC detected near the Earth is the counterpart of the erupted HC in the corona for this event. The study provides strong observational evidence of the HC as an MFR.",

            "abstract": "Because of human pressures, the need to understand and predict the long-term dynamics of subtropical dry forests is urgent. Through modifications to the ZELIG vegetation demographic model, including the development of species- and site-specific parameters and internal modifications, the capability to predict forest change within the Guanica State Forest in Puerto Rico can now be accomplished. One objective was to test the capability of this new model (i.e. ZELIG-TROP) to predict successional patterns of secondary forests across a gradient of abandoned fields currently being reclaimed as forests. Model simulations found that abandoned fields that are on degraded lands have a delayed response to fully recover and reach a mature forest status during the simulated time period; 200 years. The forest recovery trends matched predictions published in other studies, such that attributes involving early resource acquisition (i.e. canopy height, canopy coverage, density) were the fastest to recover, but attributes used for structural development (i.e. biomass, basal area) were relatively slow in recovery. Biomass and basal area, two attributes that tend to increase during later successional stages, are significantly lower during the first 80–100 years of recovery compared to a mature forest, suggesting that the time scale of resilience in subtropical dry forests needs to be partially redefined. A second objective was to investigate the long and short-term effects of increasing hurricane disturbances on vegetation structure and dynamics, due to hurricanes playing an important role in maintaining dry forest structure in Puerto Rico. Hurricane disturbance simulations within ZELIG-TROP predicted that increasing hurricane intensity (i.e. up to 100% increase) did not lead to a large shift in long-term AGB or NPP. However, increased hurricane frequency did lead to a 5-40% decrease in AGB, and 32-50% increase in NPP, depending on the treatment. In addition, the modeling approach used here was able to track changes in litterfall, coarse woody debris, and other forest carbon components under various hurricane regimes, a critical step for understanding the future state of subtropical dry forests.",

By analyzing signature features of air-guns of clustered, tuned, time-delayed and coded in different 3D marine air-gun source, the optimum firing pattern of marine gradient 3D air-gun arrays has been set up. Because of the complexity of ghosts, traditional seismic acquisition using horizontal air-gun arrays cannot eliminate the ghost effectively. The acquisition applying gradient air-gun array utilizes the ghost’s feature that its distance to the desired signal grows with the increase of the source’s depth, so it can suppress the source ghost relatively easily and improve the frequency band-width of seismic data. By comparing and analyzing the theory and the actual application effect, the signature simulation of the gradient air-gun source has been verified. Using the gradient source, components of high and low frequency of seismic reflection data are enhanced. Meanwhile, the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of seismic data are improved and the imaging result becomes better.",

            "abstract": "Afforestation, the planting of trees on previously non-forested land, is commonly practiced around the world to provide wood, reduce erosion, and restore degraded agricultural land. Although afforestation has the potential to meet these objectives while increasing carbon uptake, its net impact on the soil depends on environmental conditions and land-use history. Availability of vital plant nutrients, such as phosphorus (P), may be altered by afforestation, but prior work has largely focused on soil carbon, and changes in soil P had not been quantitatively reviewed. We conducted a literature meta-analysis of changes in total and plant-available soil P with afforestation, compiling 49 studies representing 186 independent forest stands on five continents. Over the full dataset, mean concentration of plant-available phosphorus (mg kg-1 soil) increased by 22.7% with afforestation (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval = [15.1%, 30.7%]), while mean concentration of total phosphorus decreased by 13.5% (95% CI = [-18.4%, -8.6%]). These data reflect trends in upper mineral soil horizons, with sampling depths clustered around 20 cm and few studies reporting data below 50 cm. Differences in prior land use partially explain the substantial variation in effect size, with larger increases in available P and smaller decreases in total P when trees were planted on degraded soils. Trends in both available and total P were also enhanced with increasing time since afforestation, suggesting that changes in soil P concentrations are driven by cumulative processes rather than site preparation and planting. Our meta-analysis suggests that 1. afforestation can transform phosphorus into more plant-accessible forms, while potentially depleting total soil stocks of P, and 2. land-use history, more than climate or species planted, determines the effects of afforestation on soils’ ability to meet the nutrient needs of vegetation.",

            "abstract": "The existence of large-scale broadband seismic arrays such as USArray across the US and the development of ambient noise and surface wave tomography have now made it possible to construct high-resolution 3D crustal models on a continental scale. In this presentation, I will briefly review how surface wave phase velocity maps can be determined across a large array using eikonal and Helmholtz tomography. Moreover, the recent use of Rayleigh wave ellipticity measurements, or Rayleigh wave H/V (horizontal to vertical) amplitude ratios, as additional constraints on crustal structure will also be discussed. In contrast to Rayleigh wave phase velocities, which are most sensitive to shear velocity structure at a depth roughly one-third of a wavelength, H/V ratios are most sensitive to impedance contrast near the surface shallower than one-sixth of a wavelength. Because of the complementary sensitivity of Rayleigh wave phase and H/V ratio measurements, a joint inversion of the two improves not only the ability to resolve shallow crustal structure but also the overall depth resolution in the crust. In this presentation, the 3D crustal model derived from USArray across the entire contiguous US will be used as an example to demonstrate the strength of the method. The ongoing effort to use the joint inversion method to constrain shallow crustal density structure will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Imaging the crust and lithosphere structure beneath North America is one of the primary targets for the NSF-funded EarthScope project. In this study, we apply the recently developed ambient noise and surface wave tomography methods to construct a detailed 3D crustal model across the entire contiguous US using USArray data between January 2007 and May 2015. By using both Rayleigh wave phase velocity and ellipticity measurements between 8 and 100 sec period, the shear velocity structure can be well resolved within the five crustal layers we modeled: three upper crust, one middle crust, and one lower crust. Clear correlations are observed between the resolved velocity anomalies and known geological features at all depths. In the uppermost crust, slow Vs anomalies are observed within major sedimentary environments such as the Williston Basin, Denver Basin, and Mississippi embayment, and fast Vs anomalies are observed in environments with deeply exhumed bedrock outcrops at the surface including the Laurentian Highlands, Ouachita-Ozark Interior Highlands, and Appalachian Highlands. In the deeper upper crust, slow anomalies are observed in deep sedimentary basins such as the Green River Basin, Appalachian Basin, Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, and areas surrounding the Gulf of Mexico. Fast anomalies, on the other hand, are observed in the Colorado Plateau, within the Great Plains between the Front Ranges and Midcontinental Rift, and east of the Appalachian Mountains. At this depth, the Midcontinental Rift and Grenville Front clearly correlate well with various velocity structure boundaries. In the middle crust, slow anomalies are mostly observed in the tectonically active areas in the western US, but relatively slow anomalies are also observed southeast of the Precambrian Rift Margins. At this depth, fast anomalies are observed beneath various deep sedimentary basins such as the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, Appalachian Basin, and Central Valley. In the lower crust, a clear west/east dichotomy is observed in which the west is around 15% slower than the east on average. The preliminary geological interpretation of the model will be discussed during the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Raleigh wave ellipticity, usually reported as vertical-to-horizontal amplitude ratio ZH, can be used to constrain earth structure. In the 0.02-0.2 Hz range, ZH ratios are typically measured from ambient noise and are used to map variations in crustal structure, especially shallow-layer density (e.g. Lin et al. 2012). At lower frequency (<0.02 Hz), ZH ratios offer unique constraints on lithospheric density, but measurements at a single station show large variability, which has yet to be fully understood. Past investigators have attributed this variability to primarily result from small-scale variations in wavespeed (Ferreira & Woodhouse, 2007), raising the prospect of using these observations as a constraint on small-lengthscale structure.\nWe measure ZH ratio using large magnitude earthquakes recorded at US Array stations. We make measurements on 1-D and 3-D synthetic waveforms, as well as earthquake data, comparing our results to model-based predictions. To analyze the large data set from the USArray, we develop an algorithm based on cluster analysis, in which similar waveforms are grouped together, based on similarity, to enable more efficient user control. ZH ratio is then calculated as the ratio of the envelope of the vertical and horizontal components of narrow band-pass filtered waveforms. Cross correlation is used to align the waveforms and ZH ratios are selected in time windows in which correlation is high and ZH is stable. The mean and observational standard deviation of the ZH ratio is measured within the selected time windows.\nWe explore the frequency and spatial distribution of ZH measurement uncertainty as well as difference between the measurements and model-based predictions. In order to identify which parameters control the stability of measurements, we quantify the effects of frequency, earthquake depth, epicentral distance, and variations with back azimuth on the stability and accuracy of ZH measurements. Finally, we identify regions where ZH ratios bear evidence of sharp lateral variations in structure.",

            "abstract": "We are studying the paleomagnetic properties of a new ~150 meter drill core from Clear Lake, CA. Step-wise demagnetization of the natural remanent magnetism (NRM) yields stable directions after 20 mT, implying that the sediments are reliable recorders of geomagnetic field behavior. Several intervals of low relative paleointensity (RPI) from the core appear to be correlated with known geomagnetic excursions. At about 46 m depth, and ~33 ka according to an age model based on radiocarbon dates obtained from pollen and the Olema ash bed, a low RPI zone seems to agree with the age and duration of the Mono Lake Excursion, previously identified between 32 and 35 ka. Slightly lower in the core, at about 50 m depth and ~40 ka, noticeably low RPI values seem to be coeval with the Laschamp excursion, which has been dated at ~41 ka.\nA volcanic ash near the bottom of the core (141 mblf) is near the same depth as an ash identified in 1988 by Andrei Sarna-Wojcicki and others as the Loleta ash bed in a previous Clear Lake core. If the basal ash in the new core is indeed the, Loleta ash bed, then the core may date back to about 270-300 ka. Depending on the age of the lowest ash, a sequence of low RPI intervals could correlate with the Blake (120 ka), Iceland Basin (188 ka), Jamaica/Pringle Falls (211 ka), and CR0 (260 ka) excursions. Correlation of the low RPI intervals to these geomagnetic excursions will help in the development of a higher resolution chronostratigraphy for the core, resolve a long-standing controversy about a possible hiatus in the Clear Lake record, and provide information about climatically-driven changes in sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "The upper portion of the Malibu Creek Watershed exposes the Monterey-Modelo Formation, a Miocene marine mudstone. This formation has been thought to contribute high concentrations of orthophosphate and nitrate to streams via groundwater leaching and baseflow. However, our recent studies suggest that high concentrations of orthophosphate and nitrate may be dominated by dry weather runoff of imported water (tap and recycled water) from watering of urban landscapes. Our study investigates El Camino Real Creek, a tributary in the Malibu Creek Watershed that traverses Monterey-Modelo Formation strata and is fed predominantly by dry weather runoff. From an initial input at a storm drain where dry weather runoff flows consistently, hydrochemical parameters range from 1.86 to 4.66 mg/L NO3-N and 1.06 to 2.28 mg/L PO4 that decrease to concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 0.59 mg/L NO3-N and 0.40 to 0.87 mg/L PO4 where El Camino Real Creek converges with Las Virgenes Creek. The decrease in nutrient content downstream is due to the transformational processes denitrification, vegetation uptake, and mixing with groundwater baseflow containing lower nutrient content. The average water isotope values for the imported (tap and recycled) endmembers are -9.1‰ δ18O and -73‰ δD. The average water isotope values for the samples collected at the storm drain range from -6.0‰ to -8.0‰ δ18O and -56‰ to -68‰ δD while isotope values downstream range from -6.0‰ to -6.3‰ δ18O and -47‰ to -48‰ δD. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen show mixing of imported water with local groundwater downstream, which demonstrates that nutrients in this creek are not strictly dominated by geologic sources. To further understand the nutrient changes and mixing percentages of imported and local water sources, diurnal studies are being conducted with the integration of nitrate isotopes to help understand the nutrient dynamics in El Camino Real Creek.",

            "abstract": "The Rosetta lander Philae successfully landed on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014. Philae carries the Dust Impact Monitor (DIM) on board, which is part of the Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME). The DIM sensor -on top of Philae- with its associate electronics consists of a 7 cm wide cube with piezoelectric plates aimed to detect millimetric and submilimetric dust particles. Through DIM we can estimate dynamical data like flux and the directionality of the impacting particles. Mass and speed of the grains can be constrained for pre-defined density and elastic grain properties. DIM was operated during three mission phases of Philae at the comet: (1) Before Philae’s separation from Rosetta at distances of about 9.6 km, 11.8 km, and 25.3 km from the nucleus barycenter. In this mission phase particles released from the nucleus on radial trajectories remained undetectable because of significant obscuration by the structures of Rosetta, and no dust particles were indeed detected. (2) During Philae’s six hours descent to its nominal landing site Agilkia, DIM detected one approximately millimeter-sized particle at a distance of 4.97 km from the nucleus’ barycenter, corresponding to an altitude of 2.4 km from the surface. This is the closest ever dust detection at a cometary nucleus by a dedicated in-situ dust detector. Laboratory calibration experiments showed that the material properties of the detected particle are compatible with a porous grain having a bulk density of approximately 250kg/m3 and a high porosity. Particles leaving the comet on radial trajectories were detectable with only a very small sensitive area of the DIM sensor while backfalling particles or particles in orbit about the nucleus had a more favorable detection geometry. (3) At Philae’s final landing site, Abydos, DIM detected no dust impact which may be due to low cometary activity in the vicinity of Philae, or due to shading by obstacles close to Philae, or both.",

            "abstract": "Fast-response accurate air-temperature measurements are required when estimating turbulent fluxes of heat, water and carbon dioxide by open-path eddy-covariance technique. In comparison with contact thermometers like thermocouples, ultra-sonic thermometers do not suffer from solar radiation loading, water vapor condensation and evaporative cooling effects. Consequently they have the potential to provide more accurate true air temperature measurements.\nThe absolute accuracy of the ultrasonic thermometer is limited by the following parameters: the distance between the transducer pairs, transducer delays associated with the electrical-acoustic signal conversion that vary with temperature, components of the wind vector that are normal to the ultrasonic paths, and humidity.\nThe distance between the transducer pairs is commonly obtained by coordinate measuring machine. Improved accuracy demonstrated in this study results from increased stiffness in the anemometer head to better maintain the ultrasonic path-length distances. To further improve accuracy and account for changes in transducer delays and distance as a function of temperature, these parameters are characterized in a zero-wind chamber over the entire operating temperature range.\nWhen the sonic anemometer is combined with a co-located fast-response water vapor analyzer, like in the IRGASON instrument, speed of sound can be compensated for humidity effects on a point-by-point basis resulting in a true fast-response air temperature measurement.\nLaboratory test results show that when the above steps are implemented in the calibration of the ultrasonic thermometer air-temperature accuracy better than ±0.5 degrees Celsius can be achieved over the entire operating range. The approach is also validated in a field inter-comparison with an aspirated thermistor probe mounted in a radiation shield.",

Temporal and spatial variations in the rainfall pattern were studied and time series analysis for one region, which was most affected by the floods, was carried out. Two precipitation products, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), were used for the period of January 1979 till December 2014 which showed similar patterns albeit with slightly different magnitudes. It was found that there was a strong seasonal trend in the precipitation corresponding to the summer Monsoons and winter Western Disturbances phenomenon; that there were high spatial variations across the country; and that the changing rainfall pattern and intensity caused massive flooding in the five year period under consideration. The case study for the selected region also showed that while there is a downward trend in the annual precipitation, specific months corresponding to the Monsoon period showed an upward trend and the intensity and occurrence of anomalous events have increased.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonic motions are commonly considered to be driven by slab pull at subduction zones and ridge push at mid-ocean ridges (MORs), with motion punctuated by plumes of hot material rising from the lower mantle. Within this model, the geometry and location of MORs are considered to be independent from deeply sourced mantle plumes commonly implicated in the formation of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs).\nHere we reconstruct the absolute locations of LIPs and MORs relative to plume locations, and find that LIPs predominantly form episodically at specific locations of MOR-plume interaction. Analysis of MOR and continental diverging plate boundary locations since 180 Myr reveals that long-standing MOR-plume interactions are enabled by slowly migrating ridge systems.\nWe calculate how much mantle material was converted to oceanic lithosphere at the MORs and calculate that slowly migrating MORs have extracted large volumes of material from the same part of the upper mantle over periods up to 180 million years. The geochemical signatures of mid-ocean ridge basalts and seismic tomographic data show that upper-mantle temperatures are elevated at significant distances from ridge–plume interactions, indicating a far-field, indirect influence of plume–ridge interactions on the upper-mantle structure.\nIn summary, long-standing interaction between divergent plate boundaries and mantle plumes, leading to the formation of LIPs, occurs in a much more systematic way than previously appreciated. The interaction of the surface spreading system with deeply sourced mantle plumes is an overlooked yet important aspect of the mantle circulation system, with likely implications for understanding a range of Earth system processes, such as evolution of the plate-mantle system, supercontinent assembly and dispersal, and patterns of ridge morphology and geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Previous works have looked at the influence of key atmospheric circulation patterns on sea ice in the Antarctic in terms of the atmosphere’s seasonal cycle. This study examines the influence of one of these atmospheric patterns, the zonal wave three (ZW3), in terms of the sea ice’s seasons from 1979-2009 in order to better understand the response of the sea ice. An index to represent the amplitude of the ZW3 was calculated using zonal anomalies of 850 hPa geopotential heights taken from the ERA-Interim data set. Sea ice concentrations (SIC), taken from the Hadley Center sea ice and sea surface temperature data set, were found to be significantly positively correlated with the ZW3 index during the ice advance season (March to August) in the Ross and Weddell Seas and off the Amery ice shelf. These regions align with where cold, southerly flow associated with the ZW3 are found. In the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas region, SIC was found to be negatively correlated with the ZW3 index, which coincides with where the warm, northerly flow of the wave is found in this region. Regression analysis showed SIC to be significantly dependent upon the ZW3 in parts of the Ross Sea, the ice edge in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas and off the Amery ice shelf during ice advance season. The results suggest that the ZW3 plays a role in the occurrence of the observed sea ice trends in the Ross Sea, Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas, Weddell Sea and off the Amery ice shelf regions during the ice advance season, the critical period for sea ice growth. The results also demonstrate that re-examining the influence of relevant atmospheric patterns on sea ice in terms of the ice’s seasonal cycles could allow firmer connections to be established between sea ice trends and atmospheric patterns.",

            "abstract": "Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient and has been identified as a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth in high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the ocean. In the North Pacific, three sources of iron (Fe) transported via. atmosphere can be suggested: (i) mineral dust from East Asia, (ii) anthropogenic Fe, and (iii) aerosols from volcanic origin. Considering these different sources, Fe can be found and transported in a variety of chemical forms, both water-soluble and -insoluble. It is generally believed that only the soluble fraction of Fe can be considered as bioavailable for phytoplankton. To assess the biogeochemical impact of the atmospheric input, attempt was made to determine Fe species by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and its water solubility, in particular to compare the three sources.\nIron species, chemical composition, and soluble Fe concentration in aerosol collected at Tsukuba (Japan) through a year were investigated to compare the contributions of mineral dust and anthropogenic components. It was found that the concentration of soluble Fe in aerosol is correlated with those of sulfate and oxalate which originate from anthropogenic sources, suggesting that soluble Fe is mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. XAS analysis showed that main Fe species in aerosols in Tsukuba were illite, ferrihydrite, hornblende, and Fe(III) sulfate. Moreover, soluble Fe fraction is closely correlated with that of Fe(III) sulfate. In spite of supply of high concentrations of Fe in mineral dust from East Asia, it was found that anthropogenic fraction is important due to its high water solubility by the presence of Fe(III) sulfate.\nMarine aerosol samples originated from volcanic ash were collected in the western North Pacific during KH-08-2 cruise (August, 2008). XAS analysis suggested that Fe species of volcanic ashes changed during the long-range transport, while dissolution experiment showed that Fe solubility of the marine aerosol is larger than that of volcanic ashes, possibly due to the transform of insoluble Fe originally contained in volcanic ashes into the aerosols with highly soluble Fe such as Fe(II) sulfate. Iit was found that the soluble Fe content in the aerosol supplied as volcanic ashes should be important due to the very high soluble Fe content in the aerosol of volcanic origin.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the controls of slope aspect on groundwater flow and geomorphic weathering within the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory by studying the orientation and density of bedrock fracturing. Based on a series of seismic refraction surveys, we compare the seismic velocities and anisotropy of the subsurface soil and regolith with the distribution of fractures observed in 7 geophysical borehole logs. Conflicting hypotheses exist as to whether bedrock fracturing, and thus hydraulic conductivity, is controlled more by the regional tectonic stress field or by slope aspect. We examine bedrock fracturing on north- and south-facing slopes via the relationship between fracture orientation and seismic velocity, and find that our south-facing slope demonstrates pronounced seismic anisotropy, with velocities of up to 2,000 m/s in the E-W direction, and approximately 1,000 m/s in the N-S direction. By contrast, the north-facing aspect demonstrates no significant anisotropy, with velocities ranging from approximately 800-1,500 m/s. Similarly, borehole logs show conjugate sets of fractures on south-facing slopes striking in a general E-W direction, while north-facing borehole data reveal a high density of fracturing with less pronounced directional dependence. Based on current models of hillslope weathering, we interpret the slower and more isotropic velocities of the north-facing slope to be a more random orientation of fractures, caused primarily by more intense weathering processes. On the south-facing slope, we interpret the conjugate fracture sets and pronounced anisotropy to be fracturing resulting from tectonic stress. Assuming that both slopes experience similar tectonic stress, results suggest that slope aspect controls weathering and groundwater flow, and north-facing slopes demonstrate a more advanced state of weathering.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric scintillation of radio waves can behave differently at different locations with a strong diurnal dependence; particularly in the equatorial regions. Ionospheric scintillations at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies have been observed during both daytime and nighttime. It is believed that daytime scintillation is associated with blanketing sporadic E (Esb), whereas nighttime scintillation is attributed to F layer irregularities. Scintillation events associated with Esbduring daytime are of our primary interest. Recent studies show that in the ionosphere, electron density profiles from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) provide valuable information to help better understand the physics of the ionosphere. In particular, GNSS RO observations of GHz scintillation in the proximity of the E-layer have been interpreted as being caused by sporadic E.\nIn this paper the characteristics of daytime scintillations at 1.5 GHz recorded simultaneously from two stations (i) Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) (2.55°N, 101.461°E; dip latitude 5.78°S), and (ii) Langkawi (6.19°N, 99.51°E; dip latitude 1.90°S) during November and December 2010 are analyzed. The characteristics of daytime GHz scintillation and its relationship with E region irregularities at equatorial regions are investigated. Ground-based scintillation and Total Electron Content (TEC) data recorded by the GSV4004 receivers were utilized in combination with the amplitude scintillation measurements in terms of GPS C/A code SNR fluctuations during a ground-based GPS and space-borne GNSS RO experiment at the two equatorial stations. Scintillation activity was found to be more prominent at UKM. Moreover, strong scintillation with the S4 index exceeding 0.6 has only been observed at UKM, while at Langkawi the scintillation intensity (S4 index) did not exceed 0.3. Signal-to-noise measurements obtained from GNSS RO indicate that daytime scintillations are very likely caused by Esb. Our further research will be concentrated on an in-depth investigation of day-time irregularities in equatorial regions using both ground and space-borne GNSS technologies.",

            "abstract": "The climate of Japan exhibits mid-latitude and east coast condition characteristics within the continent, which leads to the large meridional range of the frontal migration and the resultant large annual seasonal change. Therefore, describing the long-term behavior of frontal zones is important for understanding the seasonal, interannual, and long-term variations of the Japanese climate. The purpose of this work is to create indices representing the atmospheric conditions throughout Japan by using frontal zone data created by an objective method at pentad intervals for the period 1948–2013.\nThe indexation was conducted by principal component analyses on the distribution maps of the frontal frequencies near frontal zones, which are defined as the latitude indicating the maximum of the frontal frequencies along each longitude in the climatological mean field. This work focuses on the first four factors, PC1–4, which indicate high contribution rates. The distribution maps of factor loadings were interpreted in the following manner as variations of the frontal zone: PC1, north–south variations in the locations of the frontal zone; PC2, frontal frequencies around the frontal zone; PC3, the running direction of the frontal zone, whether northwest–southeast or southwest–northeast; and PC4, west–east variations of the frontal frequencies.\nThese factors could be regarded as the indices representing the atmospheric conditions throughout Japan. The result of correlation analysis among the indices in this work and those representing global climatic phenomena such as Niño3 sea surface temperature (SST), in addition to Pacific decadal and Arctic oscillations, indicated the comprehensive relationships revealed in previous research. Furthermore, several long-term trend characteristics were exhibited, such as the southward shift of frontal zones in mid- and late spring and the increase of frontal frequencies around frontal zones in mid- and late summer. Thus, the simple indices created in this work verify the effectiveness in the investigation of climate change with regard to the seasonal march.",

This study aims at monitoring the presence and concentration of DEHP and other phthalates in groundwater and tap water systems in Puerto Rico, which has one of the highest rates of preterm birth in the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests a liquid-liquid extraction method that uses methylene chloride as the preferred organic solvent for the extractions. This work presents modified EPA methods that reduce the volume of sample and solvent used, lower the time of analysis, increase productivity, and decrease hazards and waste. Distribution coefficient of DEHP between methylene chloride and water are estimated and related to sample extraction efficiency. Research results indicate that DEHP is in fact distributed between water and methylene chloride with a distribution coefficient average value of 1.24. The study concludes that the sample and solvent volumes have influence on the efficiency but have not an effect on the distribution coefficient. The tests show higher extraction efficiencies for lower DEHP concentrations and higher extraction volumes. Results from the water analysis show presence of DEHP in 55% of groundwater and 44% of tap water samples, indicating a potential exposure through water.",

            "abstract": "While instantaneous peak flow (IPF) records have historically been necessary for practical applications in flood risk management and hydraulic structure design, mean daily flow (MDF) values are often all that are available. To address this problem, we propose a simple method, which requires only MDF records as its input and uses the rising and falling slopes of daily hydrographs, to estimate IPFs. We applied this method to 144 catchments in Iowa, USA, with drainage areas ranging from about 7 to 220,000 km2. This application involves about 3800 peak flow events originating from different flood generation mechanisms over the period from 1997 to 2014. About 55% of the catchments have prediction errors within ±10%, and 85% of the catchments have predictions errors within ±20%. The method works well for catchments larger than 500 km2, poorly for catchments smaller than 100 km2, and fairly well for catchments in between these sizes. The reduction in the method’s effectiveness with decreasing catchment size is due to the fact that the smaller the catchment, the more information is lost when using MDF to characterize the instantaneous flow processes. Our proposed method is simple and promising in terms of estimating IPFs from MDFs for areas where IPF records are unavailable or are insufficient.",

Interpretations of what the revealed patterns mean are dependent on a foundation of in-situ plot-based observations. Despite the importance of ground-based observations, only a few areas have been intensively sampled and mapped, mainly in the vicinity of permanent Arctic observatories. Much of the information is project specific and is based on sampling protocols that are difficult to compare across sites. Here, we demonstrate a more consistent multi-level hierarchic approach for vegetation description and analysis at the Toolik Lake Field Station, Alaska. We advocate for a well-coordinated, interdisciplinary network of vegetation observation stations. Key recommendations include: (1) Complete local floras for many more areas in than presently exist. Species names should be standardized using the Pan-Arctic Flora. (2) Permanently marked and replicated vegetation monitoring plots in the full range of habitats at each station. Methods of establishing and monitoring the plots should include consistent internationally accepted standards for vegetation data collection, vegetation classification, plot markings, and standardized approaches to describe the local environment, including photo points showing the vegetation and soils up close and in landscape view. (3) Standardized approaches for collecting in-situ time-series of spectral data. Standardized methods for collecting and analyzing phytomass data are especially needed. (4) Interdisciplinary studies. Vegetation observations should be conducted in concert with observations of soils, permafrost, animals and ecosystem processes at the same plots. (5) Periodic (perhaps every 5-10 years) ground-based surveys. These should include surveys of species composition, canopy structure, biomass, leaf-area index, and NDVI, along with high-resolution satellite-based remote-sensing products at the same time.",

Compared to ambient measurements of the total number concentration of INPs, relatively little data exists on the size distribution of INPs in the atmosphere. Information on the size of INPs may be useful in source identification, modeling their transport in the atmosphere, and determining the degree to which common INP instrumentation captures the full atmospheric INP population. Measured using the micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor-droplet freezing technique (MOUDI-DFT), we report immersion-mode INP number concentrations as a function of particle size at ground-level sites in North America and Europe, including Arctic, alpine, coastal, marine, agricultural, and suburban environments. On average, more than 91 % of INPs active at -15 °C were found to be supermicron in size and 62 % were in the coarse mode (> 2.5 µm). While these percentages decreased with decreasing freezing temperature, many INPs remained in the supermicron with nearly half of those active at -25 °C belonging to the coarse mode.",

            "abstract": "The seasonal prediction of both the surface air temperature and the first-flowering date (FFD) over South Korea are produced using dynamical downscaling (Hur and Ahn, 2015). Dynamical downscaling is performed using Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) v3.0 with the lateral forcing from hourly outputs of Pusan National University (PNU) coupled general circulation model (CGCM) v1.1. Gridded surface air temperature data with high spatial (3km) and temporal (daily) resolution are obtained using the physically-based dynamical models. To reduce systematic bias, simple statistical correction method is then applied to the model output. The FFDs of cherry, peach and pear in South Korea are predicted for the decade of 1999-2008 by applying the corrected daily temperature predictions to the phenological thermal-time model. The WRF v3.0 results reflect the detailed topographical effect, despite having cold and warm biases for warm and cold seasons, respectively. After applying the correction, the mean temperature for early spring (February to April) well represents the general pattern of observation, while preserving the advantages of dynamical downscaling. The FFD predictabilities for the three species of trees are evaluated in terms of qualitative, quantitative and categorical estimations. Although FFDs derived from the corrected WRF results well predict the spatial distribution and the variation of observation, the prediction performance has no statistical significance or appropriate predictability. The approach used in the study may be helpful in obtaining detailed and useful information about FFD and regional temperature by accounting for physically-based atmospheric dynamics, although the seasonal predictability of flowering phenology is not high enough.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out with the support of the Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development under Grant Project No. PJ009953 and Project No. PJ009353, Republic of Korea.\n",

We used observed isotope ratios, in combination with an isotope-enabled GCM (IsoGSM) to improve our understanding of the impacts of moisture source and its transport on the variability of water vapor isotopes. The isotopic measurements of water vapor and precipitation suggested that vapor isotopes in the study area were controlled not only by air-rain isotopic exchange but also kinetic effects associated with vegetation activity at the seasonal time scale. The contribution of land evapotranspiration to local water vapor content (FET) was approximately 14.8±12.8% on an annual average with a summer maximum of 23.2±13.8%. Our results show that large scale atmospheric circulation is the primary control on the variability of the near surface water vapor δD. An IsoGSM tagging simulation experiment demonstrated advection and mixing of moisture from different oceanic source regions can explain the large temporal variation of surface water vapor isotope at this site.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between tropical cyclones (TCs) and climate variability/change continues to be an area of significant scientific inquiry. Much of this research focuses on the influence of rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on various metrics of TC activity. For example, previous research employing a spatial tessellation approach suggests that a 1 °C increase in SST is associated with a 7.9 m s-1 increase in the upper limit of TC intensity. Although this prior research indicates that SST describes nearly 70% of the variability in the upper limit of TC intensity, the role of various atmospheric variables has not been examined using the spatial tessellation approach. This study utilizes a similar spatial methodology to quantify the influence of both the atmosphere (e.g., 400—700 hPa relative humidity, 200—850 hPa vertical shear, 100 hPa temperature) and SST on climatological TC frequency and intensity for the North Atlantic basin.\nResults from observed and reanalyzed data are compared to climate model output from the Florida State University/Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies global spectral model. It is shown that of the variables considered, SST and 400—700 hPa relative humidity are the only significant predictors of observed TC intensity. Conversely, relative humidity is the only significant predictor of climate model-simulated TC intensity. Regarding frequency, results indicate statistically significant differences in SST, shear, and relative humidity during years with versus years without TCs for portions of the North Atlantic basin. These preliminary results will help inform the development of probabilistic models that use output from global climate model simulations as predictors of regional TC frequency and intensity.",

This paper presents a platform specifically designed to tackle those difficulties, called Uncertainty Quantification Python Laboratory (UQ-PyL). The key functions contained in UQ-PyL include design of experiment (DoE), uncertainty analysis, global sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling, and multi-objective optimization. We intend to demonstrate how UQ-PyL can be used to improve the predictive skill of the NWP model with a case study involving 5-day weather forecasting in the Greater Beijing region using the WRF model.

            "abstract": "Experimental deltas are often braided systems with highly mobile channels that rapidly rework the topset surface. Plants can aid in decreasing channel mobility and creating more stable distributary networks. Here we compare two sets of experiments that used alfalfa as a proxy for delta vegetation to determine the effects of plants on delta and channel dynamics. One set of experiments was conducted with relatively low water and sediment discharge, and the second had an order of magnitude higher water discharge than the first. We found that the low discharge experiments had multiple small bifurcating channels that could easily be annealed by floods and were not capable of removing vegetation. This resulted in relatively uniform sediment delivery to the shoreline, thus forming a smooth shoreline planform pattern. The high discharge experiments had a more two-way feedback between the channels and plants, in which the plants constricted the flow into channels and the resulting strong channels were able to erode vegetated banks. The flow constriction created two dominant channels that were more persistent than in the low discharge experiments. This resulted in a highly irregular shoreline punctuated by a few active lobes of deposition. Much of this variability was a function of channel depth, since channels must be deeper than plant roots in order to effectively erode vegetated banks. Thus, the scale at which we choose to model deltas may give drastically different results, as our two sets of experiments showed a range of delta geometries, shoreline rugosity, and channel networks. For deltas in particular, it is important to understand this variability as we plan coastal restoration efforts and try to predict the optimal discharge conditions to build new deltas on the coast.",

Mottles develop in soils forming from relatively uniform shoreline sediments, below the depth of bioturbation. Mottles consist of an interconnected network of low-chroma clay-and-carbon enriched central regions (gray; 2.5Y 6/1) bordered by bleached parent material (white; 2.5Y 8/1) within a diminishing matrix of high-chroma oxidized parent material (orange; 7.5YR 5/8). To explore the nature of mottle development, physical and chemical characteristics of mottle separates (orange, gray, and white) were compared through the deep time represented by the chronosequence. Mineralogical, isotopic, and surface-area differences among mottle separates indicate that centimeter-scale mass-transfer acting across millennia is an integral part of pedogenesis, weathering-front propagation, and carbon and nutrient transfer. Elemental analysis, electron microscopy, and iron-isotope systematics indicate that mottle development is driven by deep roots together with their fungal and microbial symbionts. The current work extends the known realm of upland mottling and shows that such features may be more common than previously recognized in semi-humid to arid regions. Deep soil horizons on old stable landforms develop reticulate mottling as the long-term imprint of rhizospheric processes that control pedogenesis, plant-community sustenance, and sequestration of carbon at depth in unsaturated zones.",

During dialysis experiments, initial HS were separated into low molecular weight fractions (LMWF, molecular weight <3,500 Da or <14,000 Da) and retentate. LMWF accounts for only 2% in TOC contents of HS molecules, while their reducing capacities are up to 33 times greater than those of initial HA. However, great amount of reducing capacities of LMWF does not cause decreasing reducing capacities of retentate relative to those of initial HA. Total reducing capacities of whole dialysis device were calculated for initial HA, retentate and LMWF in native and reduced state, and result suggests that releasing of LMWF leads to production and explosion of RFG. LWMF have great fluorescence intensities for protein-like fluorophores and humic acids-like fluorophores (quinone-like functional groups), where quinonoid π-π* transition is responsible for the great reducing capacities of LMWF. The 3,500 Da molecules (0.25 nm diameter) of HS are capable of stimulating transformation of redox-active metals or potential pollutants trapped in soil micropores (< 2 nm diameter).

In this study, we try to interpret induction arrows observed at the island that have been estimated from broad-band magnetotelluric (MT) data and existing magnetovariational data, which are sensitive to lateral conductivity distribution of the Earth. Overall pattern of observed induction arrows is clearly frequency-dependent: perpendicular to nearby coastline of the observation site for higher frequencies than 0.1 Hz but rotating toward south or southeastern direction for lower frequency than 0.01 Hz. Furthermore, induction arrows at frequencies lower than 0.001 Hz, which derived from the existing magnetovariational data, point to the south or the southeast as well. In order to examine whether observed induction arrows can be explained by only surrounding seas, 3-D MT modeling considering seas surrounding the island is carried out. The results demonstrate that induction arrows at higher frequencies than 0.01 Hz can be explained well by the surrounding seas but for lower frequencies than 0.01 Hz there are significant discrepancies between observed and calculated arrows. This strongly implies the existence of deep-seated conductor located beneath the farther south of the island, namely, the East China Sea. The existence of this deep-seated conductor can be supported by other previous geophysical studies, which is likely to be caused by mantle upwelling derived from shear traction of horizontal mantle flow in tensional back arc of Kyushu Island, Japan.",

            "abstract": "Electrokinetic effect, as one of the most possible generation mechanisms of the seismo-electromagnetic phenomenons associated with natural earthquakes, has interested many researchers. Besides, it is also considered as a potential tool for the water/oil exploration. Recently, we numerically investigated the electromagnetic (EM) fields due to the electrokinetic effect in mixed layered model. The mixed model comprises not only porous layers but also solid layers. We firstly tested a two-layer mixed model. The numerical results show that, in addition to the radiation EM fields, another kind of evanescent EM fields can be generated by the seismic waves arriving at the interface with incident angles greater the critical angle. The evanescent EM fields decay faster than the radiation EM fields when getting away from the interface. For the seismic frequency band, the evanescent EM fields in the solid are still measurable at a distance of, e.g., 2km to the interface. We then tested a eight-layer mixed model. The top and bottom layers are solid and the other layers are porous. A finite fault of 20x10km is located in the porous region. The focal depth is 8km. The applied source time function is a ramp fuction with an arise time of 0.8s. Point stacking method was used to compute the wave-fields caused by the finite fault. Our nuemrical results show that, this model can generate the EM fields before the arrival of seismic waves as well as the residual EM fields. Both the two kinds of EM fields have been observed in field observations. There is a possibility that the anomalous EM activities before big earthquakes may be caused by the fluid flow in the shallow Earth as a result of the stress changes.",

            "abstract": "The Bay of Bengal (BOB) region is characterized by the presence of two linear N-S trending aseismic ridges, the 85°E and Ninetyeast ridges which have progressively buried below thick sediments towards north. We present here the results of an integrated interpretation of geophysical data using multichannel seismic reflection, gravity and magnetic datasets over these two ridges to study the crustal structure and mode of their emplacement. The ridges divide the deep sedimentary BOB region into three major sub-basins. Considering the sediment deposition pattern within the sub-basins and over the ridges, it is found that both ridge structures have played a role in sediment dispersal pattern during the pre- and post Bengal Fan sedimentation. The Geoid-Topography Ratio (GTR) analysis indicates that both the ridges are compensated at shallow depths. Seismically constrained gravity and magnetic models and flexural gravity modeling over these ridges support their volcanic origin, and suggest the following: i) 85°E Ridge was emplaced in off-ridge environment (Te=10-15 km); ii) the higher Te values of ~ 25 km over the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount (ANS) reflect the secondary emplacement of the seamount peaks in off-ridge environment, iii) that the emplacement of the Ninetyeast Ridge north of 2°N occurred in an off-ridge environment as indicated by higher Te values (25-30 km). These results attain significance in terms of understanding of the interactions between plume- volcanism and lithosphere in the Bay of Bengal.",

            "abstract": "In this study, total gaseous mercury (TGM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particulate bound mercury (PBM) were measured on Yongheung Island off the coast of Korea between mainland Korea and Eastern China. Yongheung Island is a small island located about 15~20 km west from the mainland Korea. Because of the geographical location of the sampling site, the effect of long-range transport of Hg emitted from China could be observed with the westerly winds, and the effect of Korean domestic sources including inland industrial/metropolitan areas and coal-fired power plants could be also evaluated with the easterly and southerly winds, respectively. Average concentrations of TGM, GOM, and PBM were 2.8 ± 1.1 ng m-3, 9.8 ± 9.9 pg m-3,and 10.6 ± 12.0 pg m-3 at the sampling site, respectively. CPF plot shows that the top 25% of TGM concentrations were associated with the winds from NNW and ENE, pointing out the significance of Northeast Chinese emissions and inland Korean emissions; however, when the criterion was used as the top 10% TGM concentration the regional transport from China became less important and the sources located in southern and eastern areas were magnified as important source areas. For GOM, the highest concentration was observed with the wind direction from mainland Korean sources. On the other hand, it was presumed that long-range transport from North Korea and China significantly enhanced PBM concentrations. PSCF also identified Chinese sources for TGM and PBM while mainland Korean sources including coal power plants located in southern part of the sampling site were determined for possible source areas of GOM. Also, we found that the ratio of GOM/PBM was reduced with the increasing contribution of long-range transport and enhanced with the significant impact of local sources, suggesting that the ratio of GOM/PBM can be used as an indicator to determine the relative importance of long-range transport vs. local sources.

For a subset of 213 CSs we determine the current sheet thickness L, current density amplitude j0 and velocity vD=j0/e n0 (n0 is the plasma density). We analyze dawn-dusk distributions of the CS parameters: L is about 3000 km at the dusk flank and grows up to 12000 km toward the dawn flank; j0 grows toward the dusk flank by a factor of 2-3; the most intense CSs (with higher vD) are observed near the midnight. We show that ion-scale CSs with the thickness of several ion thermal gyroradii (say less than seven) are observed in middle and distant tail regions in more than 50% of crossings. For observed CSs electrons provide likely the dominant contribution to the current density. We divide the subset into intense and weak CSs (using parameter vD). The weak CSs have thickness of about 20 ion thermal gyroradii and Bz of about 1.5 nT. The intense CSs have thickness of about 3-7 thermal gyroradii and much smaller Bz implying a more stretched field line configuration. For intense CSs velocity vD is larger for larger amplitudes of ion bulk velocity vx that is likely due to larger contribution of Speiser ions. Intense CSs may be responsible for the Bursty Bulk Flow generation in the middle and distant tail regions.",

RBSP-A detected the MeV electron phase space density increased by an order of magnitude in about one hour at L* > 5.0. At L* = 4.4, the injected MeV electrons were also detected. It is suggested that the magnetic field dipolarization associated with the substorm injections alone can explain that the prompt recovery and enhancements of the relativistic electron (~ MeV) fluxes in the outer radiation belt. The observations of THEMIS-A also first presented that the near-Earth magnetotail at substorm onset is important in the MeV electron injection event: the enhanced fluxes of ~200 keV electrons are the source population and intense electromagnetic pulses are the driving source of MeV injected electrons.

            "abstract": "Water contamination in rivers embedded in urbanizing areas is increasingly affected by anthropogenic factors. The impacts may vary with location, time and water variables particularly in rapidly growing areas with clear urbanization gradients. Therefore, characterizing the temporal trend and identifying responsible divers to water quality changes in areas with different urbanization intensity could greatly improve our knowledge about human-water interactions. We employed geographically weighted regression (GWR) to interpret the determinants of river water quality changes in four urban development zones, i.e. central urban, suburban, central county and rural areas. Monitoring data of 8 variables- permanganate (CODMn), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonium (NH3–N), petroleum (oil), volatile phenol (VP), phosphorus (TP), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) from 33 stations were collected from 2004, 2008 and 2010. Five determinants were identified: urban land use intensity, environmental policies, industrial zone expansion, land use composition, and gross domestic product (GDP). Relationships between these identified determinants and water quality changes showed great variations due to their different nature and sensitivity. Typically, for zones with higher urbanization intensity located in central cities and central counties, urban land use had positive impacts on river water quality improvement. However, in less urbanized areas, rapid urban expansion indicated rapid river water degradation. Environmental policies had distinct influences on river pollution control in highly-urbanized areas, but led to unexpected negative impacts in areas beyond the management priorities. Industrial activities were the major contributor to heavy metal pollution in suburban areas while boosted N, P decrease in central cities. Our study highlighted the importance of “local” management instead of one-size-fits-all system in mitigating undesirable impacts of urbanization on water environment.",

In this study, we present a sub-continental and national level assessment of TDF loss patterns in Mexico and Central America at high spatial and temporal resolution using remote sensing and GIS technologies. We used the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset published by Hansen et al.

We analyzed forest loss within and around mapped TDF cover mapped by Portillo-Quintero et al. 2010. In order to minimize errors in source data, we overlaid a 25 x 25 km grid on top of the regional dataset and conducted a cell by cell and country by country inspection at multiple scales using high resolution ancillary data. We identified trends in the clustering of space-time TDF deforestation data using ArcGIS, categorizing trends in: new, consecutive, intensifying, persistent, diminishing, sporadic, oscillating and historical hotspots (high frequency of deforestation events) and cold spots (low frequency of deforestation). In general, the region is experiencing less frequent deforestation events with a higher number of intensifying and new cold spots across TDF landscapes. However, an important number of intensifying and persistent hotspots exist so no general trend in forest loss was detected for the period 2001-2013, except for El Salvador which shows a significant decreasing trend in forest loss. Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala are the major sources of intensifying, persistent and new deforestation hot spots. These were identified in the southern pacific coast and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, northwestern Guatemala, both western and eastern Honduras and around Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua.",

Detailed information on the impacts of water use and nutrient application on agro-ecosystem services including crop yields, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) loss is the key to guide field managements. In this study, we use the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate the biogeochemical processes for rice rotated cropping systems in China. We set varied scenarios of water use in more than 1600 counties, and derived optimal rates of N application for each county in accordance to water use scenarios. Our results suggest that 0.88 ± 0.33 Tg per year (mean ± standard deviation) of synthetic N could be reduced without reducing rice yields, which accounts for 15.7 ± 5.9% of current N application in China. Field managements with shallow flooding and optimal N applications could enhance ecosystem services on a national scale, leading to 34.3% reduction of GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, and CO2), 2.8% reduction of overall N loss (NH3 volatilization, denitrification and N leaching) and 1.7% increase of rice yields, as compared to current management conditions. Among provinces with major rice production, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hubei could achieve more than 40% reduction of GHG emissions under appropriate water managements, while Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian could reduce more than 30% N loss with optimal N applications. Our modeling efforts suggest that China is likely to benefit from reforming water and fertilization managements for rice rotated cropping system in terms of sustainable crop yields, GHG emission mitigation and N loss reduction, and the reformation should be prioritized in the above-mentioned provinces.\nKeywords: water regime, nitrogen fertilization, sustainable management, ecological modeling, DNDC",

During MJO phases 2 to 3 (P2 and P3) defined by Wheeler and Hendon (2004), prominent diurnal variation in convection was observed by satellites when moderate low-level westerly winds were dominant over the eastern Indian Ocean. The diurnal convection peaks were prominent over the island of Sumatra in the evening, while migrations of the convection toward the Indian Ocean were observed in the early morning. By using the Global Positioning System around the western region offshore of Sumatra, a significant reduction in water vapor was observed from evening until midnight, compensating for the upward motion over the island. During midnight to early morning, the water vapor increased in the western offshore region as the convections migrated from the island. During P2 to P3, the atmosphere over the eastern Indian Ocean contains abundant water vapor, while the Maritime Continent is fairly well heated by solar radiation under calm conditions. This situation should be favorable for the development of two diurnal convection peaks: the evening convection over the land induced by solar radiative heating and the midnight convection over the ocean triggered by convergence of the low-level westerly wind and the land breeze.",

To design effective countermeasures for the pollution, understanding of contaminant transport and source identification will be in need. Classification of groundwater chemistry is useful tool to compare between water from different sources. In this study, results of 4 multivariate analyses for groundwater chemistry were compared.\nIn the multivariate analyses, 277 sampling points data of major ion concentrations (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, HCO3-, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) were used (2011-2013). 4 multivariate analysis methods were as follows; 1) HCA (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis); Based on 8 major ion concentrations (8 dimensional 277 vectors), HCA was performed. 2) HCA with PCA (Principal Component Analysis); PCA was performed with major ion concentrations. Based on 2 principal components scores obtained from PCA (2 dimensional 277 vectors), HCA was performed. 3) HCA with SOM (Self Organized Map); SOM was performed with major ion concentrations. Obtained 84 reference vectors used for HCA (8 dimensional 84 vectors). 4) HCA, SOM with PCA; PCA was performed with major ion concentrations. Based on 2 principal component scores obtained from PCA, SOM was performed. Finally, HCA was performed with 80 reference vectors (2 dimensional 80 vectors). The number of clusters were fixed to 5, which was determined based on DBI (Davies-Bouldin Index) at the method 3).\nBroadly characteristics of each cluster is same among all multivariate analysis methods. According to this characteristics, 2 of 5 clusters show nitrate pollution, which are exceeding Japanese drinking water standards (10 mg/L). This 2 clusters can be distinguished by level of nitrate concentration. Other 3 clusters can also distinguished by level of major ion concentrations.

In the methods 1) and 3), higher nitrate concentration points were not classified into polluted clusters. In this regards, methods 2) and 4) seem better to represent classification of the field water chemistry. Difference between methods 2) and 4) is the clusters of 2 sampling points.

            "abstract": "A global coupled prediction system is used to predict the ocean circulation associated with the MJO during the CINDY/DYNAMO field campaign. The ocean component of the system is HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model) that uses exceptionally high horizontal resolution (1/12°) to accurately simulate the ocean circulation. The atmospheric component is NAVGEM (NAVy Global Environmental Model) with the resolution of T359L50, in which a new convection scheme is recently implemented. During the field campaign, three active episodes of large-scale convection and anomalous surface zonal winds associated with the MJO propagated eastward across the tropical Indian Ocean. Our model prediction primarily focuses on the second MJO event in November, which was particularly well monitored by the DYNAMO observational network. The model was initialized on November 1st, and integrated for 40 days, which includes the period of the initiation of MJO convection in the central Indian Ocean in late November. The model is able to predict the initiation of MJO convection, which is associated with the large-scale strong westerly winds generated near the equator. These westerlies drove strong oceanic equatorial jets in the entire tropical Indian Ocean. The timing and strength of the equatorial jet predicted by the model is consistent with those observed by the CINDY/DYNAMO moorings. Also, the spatial pattern of equatorial and off-equatorial ocean circulations in late November agrees with satellite-derived surface currents reasonably well. The impact of air-sea coupling on the prediction of equatorial westerly wind events is further discussed based on the comparison of coupled and uncoupled model simulations.",

            "abstract": "We present new thermal and strength models of Mainland China. We integrate thermal model for the crust, using a 3D steady-state heat conduction equation, with estimates for the upper mantle thermal structure obtained by inverting an S-wave tomography model. Using the new thermal model and attributing to the lithospheric layers a ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ rheology, respectively, we estimate the integrated strength of the lithosphere. In the Ordos and the Sichuan basins, characterized by intermediate temperatures, strength is primarily concentrated in the crust, when the rheology is ‘soft’, and in both the crust and upper mantle, when the rheology is ‘hard’. In turn, the Tibetan Plateau and the Tarim basin have a weak/strong lithosphere mainly on account of their high/low temperatures. Deep earthquakes releasing high seismic energy, occurring beneath Tien Shan orogen, may be related to the brittle failure of anhydrous granulite-faciesrocks composing its lower crust. In contrast, the fluids released by the Indian slab favor the triggering of earthquakes located in the deep crust of south Tibet. Comparison of temperatures, strength and effective viscosity variations with the earthquakes distribution and their seismic energy released indicates that both the deep part of the crust and the upper mantle of the Tibetan Plateau are weak and prone to flow towards the adjacent areas. On account of the high strength of some of the tectonic domains surrounding Tibet, the flow is directed northward beneath the Qaidam basin and turns south of the Sichuan basin, moving toward the weak South China block.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear waste deposit is commonly isolated by buffer material, such as bentonite, to prevent its leak from deposit cane. Therefore, the hydrogeological property of buffer material is the key issue for the success of nuclear waste deposition. Lee et al. (2013) performed an experimental work to explore the diffusion coefficient of Bentonite (MX-80) which is used as the buffer material of nuclear waste deposits. Scale effect was found in the diffusion coefficient. The result contradicts to the stochastic theory which states that the scale effect appears for the dispersion coefficient but not the diffusion coefficient. We reexamine the experimental data to explore the issue. Both analytical solutions of diffusion and advection-dispersion equations (ADE) were applied to estimate the parameters. Considering the micro-heterogeneity of bentonite, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to analyze the velocity, dispersion and diffusion coefficients of the breakthrough data from column tests. The results show that the experiment is influenced by the velocity. Diffusion model generates significant error in matching the breakthrough data. ADE model which considers velocity and dispersion performs better than the diffusion model. Scale effect is found in dispersion coefficient even in the small scale below the Gelha’s (1993) data. Dispersion coefficient increases linearly with experimental lengths.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of NOAA Active Region 11817 during 2013 August 10--12, when it developed a complex field configuration and produced four confined, followed by two eruptive, flares. These C-and-above flares are all associated with a magnetic flux rope (MFR) located along the major polarity inversion line, where shearing and converging photospheric flows are present. With the aid of nonlinear force-free field modeling, we identify the MFR through mapping magnetic connectivities and computing the twist number Tw for each individual field line. The MFR is moderately twisted (Tw < 2) and has a well-defined boundary of high squashing factor Q. Its axis coincides with the field line with the peak Tw in the rope. We find that the MFR's peak Tw temporarily increases within half an hour before each flare while it decreases after the flare peak for both confined and eruptive flares. This pre-flare increase in Tw has little effect on the active region's free magnetic energy or any other parameters derived for the whole region, due to its moderate amount and the MFR's relatively small volume, while its decrease after flares is clearly associated with the stepwise decrease in free magnetic energy due to the flare. We suggest that Tw may serve as a useful parameter in prewarning the onset of eruption, and therefore, the consequent space weather effects. The helical kink instability is identified as the prime candidate onset mechanism for the considered flares.",

            "abstract": "The last deglacial interval (~19-11 ka) was marked by major perturbations to Earth’s climate coupled with rising atmospheric temperatures and CO2 concentrations, reaching near-modern levels by the early Holocene. Several discharges of freshwater into the North Atlantic caused by melting and collapse of continental ice sheets affected ocean circulation and sea-surface temperatures, triggering abrupt changes in terrestrial climate worldwide. While the timing and amount of associated temperature changes have been quantified from ice core records at high latitudes, corresponding information from lower latitudes is comparatively low and concentrated along coastlines, at high elevations, and in tropical and mesic regions. This is problematic for efforts to improve the reliability of long-term climate forecasts, reliant on models lacking sufficient validation from paleoclimate reconstructions for interior drylands that comprise nearly half of Earth’s land surface.\nEvidence for past hydrologic changes in arid regions comes from ancient lake-shoreline deposits in internally drained basins, allowing quantitative comparison of the recorded effective moisture increases. However, the utility of these records depends on our relatively limited ability to deconvolve the contributions of temperature and precipitation to these changes. Here we explore the possible role of the summer monsoon in causing deglacial-age highstands in the southern Basin and Range. We employ clumped isotope analysis to generate paleotemperature and surface-water d18O estimates from carbonates in fossil shoreline and wetland deposits for comparison to output from PMIP3 coupled climate models and the model ensemble. Additionally, we present higher resolution output from LMDZ, the atmosphere-only component of the IPSL coupled model, employing LGM boundary conditions along with a hosing experiment designed to simulate Heinrich 1. For all simulations, we present analysis of changes in moisture transport, precipitation, evaporation, and resulting water isotopes.",

Recently, as the Mongolian Plateau has been affected by global warning, it has been facing several times severe droughts. So, it is very important to measure continuously and precisely the surface soil moisture.\nWe have been successfully carrying out the in situ soil moisture and meteorological observations using some automatic stations (from 13 to 16 stations) in a 1.1º by 1.1º flat surface land (study area) covered with pasture/shrubs, and a daily large-scale soil moisture observation on the Mongolian Plateau by AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS) of AQUA and AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) of GCOM-W1 (Global Change Observation Mission-Water 1) since 2001 with making a validation of the AMSR-E/AMSR2 soil moisture products in every year.\nAs a result, we have obtained a few new findings about soil moisture dynamics in the study area. Concretely, there was a decreasing trend of the surface soil moisture in the study area during the period from 2001 to 2008 with the drought development and inversely it started to increase slightly in 2009 with the increase of rainfall in summer. The ratio of evapotranspiration to rainfall from April to September was estimated to be more than about 95 %, and the rainfall condition in summer controlled the amount of annual precipitation and the wet condition on the soil surface.\nWe also knew that AMSR-E/AMSR2 can continuously and successfully conduct a long term monitoring observation of the surface soil moisture on the Mongolian Plateau with the high measurement accuracy between 4 and 5 % on a large scale. This fact suggests that AMSR-E/AMSR2 soil moisture observation is useful for studies of water cycle over large areas of grass.\nKeywords: soil moisture, rainfall, in situ observation, AMSR-E/AMSR2, Mongolian Plateau",

            "abstract": "Most forest dynamic models predict the stable state of size structure as well as the total basal area and biomass in mature forest, the variation of forest stands are mainly driven by environmental factors after the equilibrium has been reached. However, although the predicted power-law size-frequency distribution does exist in analysis of many forest inventory data sets, the estimated distribution exponents are always shifting between -2 and -4, and has a positive correlation with the mean value of DBH. This regular pattern can not be explained by the effects of stochastic disturbances on forest stands. Here, we adopted the partial differential equation (PDE) approach to deduce the systematic behavior of an ideal forest, by solving the diffusion equation under the restricted condition of invariable resource occupation, a periodic solution was gotten to meet the variable performance of forest size structure while the former models with stable performance were just a special case of the periodic solution when the fluctuation frequency equals zero. In our results, the number of individuals in each size class was the function of individual growth rate(G), mortality(M), size(D) and time(T), by borrowing the conclusion of allometric theory on these parameters, the results perfectly reflected the observed \"exponent-mean DBH\" relationship and also gave a logically complete description to the time varying form of forest size-frequency distribution. Our model implies that the total biomass of a forest can never reach a stable equilibrium state even in the absence of disturbances and climate regime shift, we propose the idea of intrinsic fluctuation property of forest and hope to provide a new perspective on forest dynamics and carbon cycle research.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of the wintertime Arctic Oscillation (AO) on the following November circulation. The application of a set of statistical methods shows that a response of November sea level pressure (SLP) to the preceding wintertime AO operates on a hemispheric scale (Choi et al., 2015). At high and middle latitudes, this response is a well-pronounced seesaw in SLP between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Winters of the positive AO polarity tend to be followed by positive SLP anomalies spanning the whole Northern Eurasia and negative SLP anomalies extending from the Bering Sea through the Western North Atlantic. Opposite SLP anomalies prevail after winters of the negative AO polarity. The response of November SLP to the preceding wintertime AO closely resembles the first empirical orthogonal function of November SLP. That is, the polarity of the wintertime AO precedes the polarity of the leading mode of variability of November SLP over the Northern Hemisphere. The wintertime AO exerts a 9-month lag impact on November circulation due to the re-emergence of a sea surface temperature anomaly over the western North Atlantic.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under grant KMIPA 2015-2081 and Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development under Grant Project No. PJ009353, Republic of Korea.\n",

The study area comprises a confined aquifer, in which a 10~21m thick clay layer overlies 31.5~36.5 m thick of sand and a 2.8~11m thick layer of gravel. EC logging of five monitoring wells yielded a value of 7~44 mS/cm, with the transition between saline and fresh water occurring at a depth of 15−38 m. Above 5 m depth, water temperature was 10~15.5°C, whereas between 5 and 50 m depth, the temperature was 15.5~17℃ and pH was 7.15~7.49. The quality of injected fresh water was 388 μS/cm with the temperature of 6.2℃, and pH was 7.70. Approximately 950 m3 of fresh water was injected into the OW-5 injection well at a rate of 370 m3/day for 62 hours, after which the fresh water zone was detected by a CTD Diver installed at a depth of 40 m. The persistence of the fresh water zone was determined via EC and temperature logging at 1 day, 21 days, 62days and 95 days after injection. The contact between fresh and saline water in the injection well was represented by a sharp boundary rather than a transitional boundary. It was concluded that the injected fresh water occupied a specific space and served to maintain the original water quality throughout the observation period. Moreover, we suggest that artificial recharge via long-term injection could help secure a new alternative water resource in this saline coastal aquifer.",

            "abstract": "The Triassic tectonic evolution of NE China was dominated by post–orogenic extension due to lithospheric delamination after the final closure of Paleo–Asian Ocean. Nevertheless, some workers recently proposed that the southward subduction Mongol–Okhotsk Ocean played an important role in the tectonic development of the Erguna Massif during Triassic. Thus, what deep geodynamic processes controlled the early Mesozoic evolution of the Xing’an Terrane remains debated. In this contribution, we present zircon U–Pb ages and geochemical data of Triassic granitic intrusions in central Great Xing’an Range, aiming to provide constraints on the question. Zircon U–Pb dating demonstrates a Triassic granitic belt with NNE orientation in the Xing’an Terrane, yielding ages between 244 and 206 Ma. The intrusive rocks consist mainly of monzogranite and syenogranite, with minor granodiorite. Geochemically, they are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), and depleted in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and high field strength elements (HFSEs) such as Nb, Ta, and Ti, similar to those from an active continental margin or an island arc setting. However, they contain high SiO2 and total K2O+Na2O contents, and high K2O/Na2O, Sr/Y and Zr/Y ratios, indicating that the Triassic rocks are actually post–orogenic high–K calc–alkaline I–type granites, and the arc–affinity features could be derived from the previous subducted oceanic fragments. The rock association, geochemical data and spatial distribution of the Triassic intrusions, along with regional sediment and structure information, make us conclude that the Triassic magmatism in central Great Xing’an Range could be generated under a post–orogenic extension setting related to closure of Paleo–Asian oceanic basin between the Xing’an and Songliao terranes, and the influence of the southward subduction of the Mongol–Okhotsk Ocean beneath the Xing’an Terrane might not be as great as expected.",

To evaluate the technical and economic benefits of this new technique, we carried out SWD survey at well G130 in Shengli Oilfield of Eastern China. Well G130 is an evaluation well, located in Dongying depression at depth more than 3500m. We used an array of portable seismometers to record the surface SWD-data, during the whole drilling progress. The pilot signal was being recorded continuously, by an accelerometer mounted on the top of the drill string. There were also two seismometers buried in the drill yard, one near diesel engine and another near derrick. All the data was being recorded continuously. According to mud logging data, we have processed and analyzed all the data. It demonstrates the drill yard noise is the primary noise among the whole surface wavefield and its dominant frequency is about 20Hz. Crosscorrelation of surface signal with the pilot signal shows its SNR is severely low and there is no any obvious event of drill-bit signals. Fortunately, the autocorrelation of the pilot signal shows clear BHA multiple and drill string multiple. The period of drill string multiple can be used for establishing the reference time (so-called zero time). We identified and removed different noises from the surface SWD-data, taking advantages of wavefield analysis. The drill-bit signal was retrieved from surface SWD-data, using seismic interferometry. And a reverse vertical seismic profile (RVSP) data set for the continuous drilling depth was established. The subsurface images derived from these data compare well with the corresponding images of 3D surface seismic survey cross the well.",

            "abstract": "Dislocation theory is well applied to calculate coseismic and postseismic effects. A key signature of the theory is that the solution of displacement is discontinuous. Various numerical methods can handle such discontinuous problems using a mesh which includes the discontinuous plane explicitly. However, generating such a mesh could be challenging and time consuming. We introduce an equivalent-bodyforce approach to handle discontinuities appearing in elastic dislocation theory. This approach gets rid of meshing the fault plane explicitly and simplifies the FEM modeling process. Based on Burridge and Knopoff’s work, we deduced a close-formed formula representing equivalent-bodyforce in FEM framework. Then compared our numerical results with Okada’s analytical solution in a test case in order to check the correctness of our formula and codes. At last, the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake was studied. We compared our numerical results with GPS observations to check the correctness of our formula and codes again, and discussed the co-seismic effects in North China of this earthquake. In the test case, our numerical results differ from Okada’s analytical solution less than 3% in most computing regions. In modelling co-seismic effects of the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, our numerical results of displacement field agree well with GPS observations in both direction and magnitude. The co-seismic stress changes in North China are in east-west tension with a magnitude about 1kPa. The north-south compression is one order of magnitude lower. The coulomb failure stress changes on active faults in North China are negative which indicates more stable, except at the north end of the Tanlu fault zone where the coulomb failure stress change is about 100Pa. Equivalent-bodyforce approach is applicable and accurate in FEM modeling. The 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake makes faults in North China more stable except the north end of the Tanlu fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Fault zones including the damage zone and the fault core have a controlling influence on the crust’s mechanical and fluid flow properties (e.g., Faulkner et al., 2010). In the Nankai subduction zone, southwest Japan, the velocity structures indicate the contrast of the pore fluid pressure between hanging wall and footwall of the megasplay fault (Tsuji et al., 2014). Nobeoka Thrust, which is an on-land example of an ancient megasplay fault, provides an excellent record of deformation and fluid flow at seismogenic depths (Kondo et al., 2005; Yamaguchi et al., 2011). Yamaguchi et al. (2011) showed that the microchemical features of syn-tectonic mineral veins along fault zones of the Nobeoka Thrust. The inversion approaches by using the mineral vein orientations can provide stress regimes and fluid driving pressure ratio (Jolly and Sanderson, 1997) at the time of fracture opening (e.g., Yamaji et al., 2010). In this study, we show (1) stress regimes in co- and post seismic period of the Nobeoka Thrust and (2) spatial heterogeneity of the fluid driving pressure ratio by using the mineral veins (extension veins) around the fault zone in the Nobeoka Thrust. We applied the inversion approach proposed by Sato et al. (2013) to estimate stress regimes by using the mineral vein orientations. The estimated stresses are the normal faulting stress regimes of which sigma 3 axes are almost horizontal and trend NNW-SSE in both the hanging wall and the footwall. The stress regimes are the negative stress for the reverse faulting stress regime that Kawasaki et al. (2014) estimated from the minor faults in the core samples of the Nobeoka Thrust Drilling Project (Hamahashi et al., 2013). And, the orientation of the sigma 3 axes of the estimated stress regime is parallel to the slip direction of the Nobeoka Thrust (Top to SSE; Kondo et al., 2005). These facts indicate the normal faulting stress regime at the time of fracture opening is the secondary stress generated by the slip of the Nobeoka Thrust. We estimated the fluid driving pressure ratio P* at the time of fracture opening by using the Mohr circle analysis that has been carried out using the vein orientation data. The estimated P* are 0.05 and 0.15-0.40 in the hanging wall and footwall, respectively. These results indicate that there are spatial differences of pore fluid pressure in the interseismic period.",

Specifically, quantitative knowledge of the spatial distribution of thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical properties is requisite. The primary parameter upon which these properties strongly depend is kerogen content. We have developed a simple but accurate method for quantifying the spatial distribution of kerogen content, spanning scales from a few microns to a hundred feet. Our approach is based on analyzing raw optical images. Promising results regarding the viability of this approach, based on comparison with lab measurements, are presented for the well-known Mahogany Zone of the Green River Formation, Utah. A combination of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and appropriately chosen mixing rules allows for the quantification of thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical properties with micron-scale resolution.

            "abstract": "The in-cloud ignition process of gigantic jets and blue jets receives attentions and discussions in the past years. The polarity and the position of their breakdown were proposed by Krehbiel et al. [2008] but no concrete observational evidence to support it directly. ELF spectrogram is a good tool to explore the electric activities, but traditional spectrograms are generated by a Fourier transform which obtain the frequency information through an integration operation. However the integration greatly limits the lowest frequency revealed by spectrogram and buries the important transient features. In this study, we applied a new but widely-used method, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), to explore the spectrogram. Instead of the integration, HHT obtains the frequency information by differentiating on the phase angle, and become a powerful tool to reveal the fast frequency variation associated with transient luminous events. More than 100 transient luminous events including 25 gigantic jets observed by Taiwan ground optical observation network were analyzed. The results indicate that approximately 70% of gigantic jets can identify a rapid frequency variation in the interval of 300-600 milliseconds before main surge discharge, and this early feature can not find a clear corresponding amplitude variation in its sferic. Since this early signal can not be identified from the traditional Fourier spectrogram, but clear in-cloud lightning was registered correspondingly by the ground optical observation. In contrast to gigantic jets, this feature of early frequency change can be seen only in less than 30% of sprites and elves. These observational evidences are able to provide new constraints on the early discharge process of gigantic jets in clouds.",

Here, low clouds are defined as clouds with their tops below the freezing level and bases within the boundary layer. The comparisons are made in terms of the general occurrence of low clouds, its mean vertical profiles, fractions of precipitating vs. non-precipitating events, diurnal cycle, and monthly time series. Other types of clouds are included to put the comparison in a broader context. The results show that the model overproduces total clouds and their precipitation fraction but underestimates low clouds in general. The model, however, produces excessive low clouds in a thin layer between 954-930 hPa, which coincides with excessive humidity near the top of the mixed layer. This suggests that the erroneously excessive low clouds stem from deficiencies in parameterization of both cloud and turbulence mixing. The model also fails to produce the observed diurnal cycle in low clouds, not exclusively due to the model coarse grid spacing that does not resolve Manus Island.",

Although extensive studies have performed on the source regions, spatial-temporal associations and geotectonic implications of the granitic rocks within the batholith, the magmatic evolution and petrogenesis of plutons in Sangri area have remained poorly studied. Here we present zircon U-Pb geochronology, Hf isotope and bulk-rock geochemistry of the late Cretaceous Sangri biotite granites (SBG) in order to shed light on this issue. Zircon U-Pb geochronology demonstrates the plutonic activity emplaced at 67~65Ma. The SBG belong to high-K calc-alkaline series, displaying highly fractionated I-type signature with high content of SiO2 (74.26~76.93%), K2O+Na2O (7.87~8.56%), but low content of CaO (0.28~1%) and P2O5 (0.02~0.04%) and pronounced depletion in Sr, Ba, Eu, Nb and Zr. The affinity of mantle component in the SBG that was elucidated by positive zircon Epsilon Hf(t) of 4.6~10.9, which makes it indistinguishable from other granitic rocks within Gangdese batholith. Tectonic models of evolution of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean suggest that the break-off of the oceanic slab is required in order to generate enormous magmatism in Gangdese batholith during 66~50Ma. Associated with the coeval gabbroic and dioritic intrusions occurred in Sangri area, we suggest the magma of SBG had been derived from juvenile lower crust mingled with mantle component upwelling through the window of Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab, and were subjected to high degree of fractionation in the magma chamber.",

This work is motivated by the calculation by Cess and Potter (1988, JGR), who proposed that surface temperature perturbations may be used as a surrogate for climate change induced by CO2 increase.\nWe compare climatic changes due to CO2 increase in slab-ocean simulations with changes forced by surface warming in prescribed-surface-temperature simulations with fixed CO2 (Cess-type experiments). We found that slab-ocean and Cess-type experiments give the same rates of change per degree surface warming for the global atmosphere temperature and circulation strength. However, the global precipitation increases almost twice as slowly in slab-ocean runs (1.5%/K) when compared to Cess-type runs (2.8%/K). Therefore, we caution that Cess-type experiments may not be suitable for studying global precipitation change under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Growing geodynamic and geochemical evidence suggests that plate tectonics may not have operated on the early Earth, with both the timing of its onset and the length of its activity far from certain [e.g., 1, 2, and references therein]. Accordingly, information from current observations and processes have the potential of sampling portions of the Earth that has both formed under and been modified by differing tectonic regimes. Here we use coupled 3D mantle convection and planetary tectonics simulations to explore evolutionary paths and planetary tectonic regimes.\nEarly in the geologic lifetime of a terrestrial planet, high mantle temperatures favour stagnant-lids. As radiogenics decay, an initial stagnant-lid may yield into a high temperature mobile-lid state. The transition from an initial stagnant-lid is a function of yield strength, in addition to both internal and surface temperatures. Each lid-state has specific diagnostics and implications for internal parameters, and consequently planetary evolution. The implication within this framework is that a system with a different thermal evolution has the potential to migrate through tectonic regimes at the same ‘thermal time’ (e.g. temperature), but very different ‘temporal times’. This indicate that multiple modes of convection and surface tectonics can potentially operate on a single planetary body at different times in its evolution, as consequence of changing internal parameters, surface temperatures, and differing thermal histories. We will discuss the implications of terrestrial worlds that can alternate, and be offset between multiple tectonic states over giga-year timescales.\n[1] O’Neill et. al. (2013b) Geol. Soc.

Use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) combined with an autoregressive (AR) model (SSA+AR hereafter) captures such features and performs well in multiple-day point forecasts. On the other hand, after SSA+AR is fitted to the O3 concentration data at various monitoring stations in the United States, the residuals from the model also appear to exhibit seasonality in volatility. That is, interval forecasts (prediction intervals) based on the common assumption of homoskedastic residuals may not properly address the changes in future volatility. Additionally, both the point and interval forecasts generated by SSA+AR may include negative numbers, a physical impossibility.\nWe discuss methods that provide non-negative competitive one- to five-day point and interval forecasts. Our methods include forecasting the logarithm of the O3 concentration and symmetrizing the resultant time series. We apply SSA+AR to our transformed time series to derive point forecasts. As the residuals from the SSA+AR fit exhibit seasonality in volatility, we apply the same methods to forecast the logarithm of the absolute residuals: First symmetrize the data and apply SSA+AR. We combine these two types of forecasts to derive our interval forecasts. We then compare our interval forecast performance in terms of sharpness and resolution against those based on the original SSA+AR that assumes homoskedastic residuals.",

We used the stress drop dataset of Oth (2013) for Japanese crustal earthquakes ranging 0.1 to 100 MPa and K-NET/KiK-net ground motion dataset against for several ground motion prediction equations with volcanic front treatment. Between-event residuals for ground accelerations and velocities are generally coincident with stress drop, as investigated by seismic intensity measures of Oth et al. (2015). Moreover, we found faster attenuation of ground acceleration and velocities for large stress drop events for the similar fault distance range and focal depth. It may suggest an alternative parameterization of stress drop to control attenuation distance rate for ground motion prediction equations.

Since it is applied several times per year, it accumulates in large quantities on plants and in soil. This study evaluates the Cu accumulation in, and desorption kinetics and adsorption capability of a sandy Ultisol in a natural field and in 3 vineyards for 5 (V1), 11 (V2), and 31 (V3) years in South of Brazil. Soil samples were collected in 8 depths (0-60 cm) of all four soil profiles, which all displayed similar soil properties. The following soil properties were measured: pH, organic matter (OM), soil bulk density, Cu total concentration, and Cu desorption and adsorption curves. A two first-order reactions model and the Langmuir isotherm were fitted to the desorption and adsorption curves, respectively. An increase in the total mass of Cu in the vineyards followed a linear regression curve, with an average annual increase of 7.15 kg ha-1. Cu accumulated down to a depth of 5, 20, and 30 cm in V1, V2 and V3, respectively, with the highest Cu content reaching 138.4 mg kg-1 in the 0-5 cm soil layer of V3. Cu desorption parameters showed a high correlation with its total concentration. Approximately 57 and 19% of total Cu were immediately and slowly available, respectively, indicating a high potential for plant absorption and/or downward movement. Cu concentrations extracted by EDTA from soil layers not affected by anthropogenic Cu inputs were very low. The maximum Cu adsorption capacity of the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers increased with the vineyard age, reaching concentrations higher than 900 mg kg-1. This increase was highly related to OM and pH, which both increased with cultivation duration. Despite of low clay content of these soils, there is low risk of groundwater Cu contamination for actual conditions. However, high Cu concentrations in the surface layer of the long-term vineyards could cause toxicity problems for this and for companion crops.",

The current waveform retrieved from the numerical integration of close magnetic signals perfectly shows the general feature and all the slow variations (such as M-components) embedded in the channel-base current measured with a shunt. In comparison with the shunt measurement, the new method has the advantage of significantly reduced noise (with the lower detection threshold as small as a few mA).

            "abstract": "A survey of geologic activity within the Solar System finds most planetary bodies to be currently operating within a stagnant-lid regime. However, Earth is an outlier and is the only body in the solar system for which we have direct observations of tectonic state. Venus, “Earth’s twin” has the potential to be another such outlier, with its broad similarity in size and bulk composition to the Earth, its current and past tectonic states are hotly debated [1-3]. However, Earth is currently the only body for which significant information about internal planetary processes is accessible, and for which direct estimates of internal temperatures of the mantle (mantle potential temperatures – TP) can be estimated. While TP estimates for other bodies have been made remotely [4,5], they tend to have high error, low sample size, and lack internal context. Recently it has been shown that the internal temperatures of 3D numerical simulations follow well prescribed scaling laws [6], and that specific lid states have specific predictions for temperatures [6], i.e., stagnant-lids have measurably greater temperatures than mobile-lids for the same parameter values. These results allow for TP to be considered in a new context. Here we calculate TP for Venus, Mars, Mercury, and the Earth using available geochemical data with well-established relationships between olivine composition and TP, and use these constraints to infer the thermal-tectonic evolution of planets using the scaling laws derived from numerical simulations [4]. We show the remotely determined TPto be viable indicators of lid-state, and offer the first quantitative and data driven determination of tectonic states through the inner Solar System. Implications for the evolution of Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Earth will be discussed.\n[1] Schubert et al. (1997) Univ. Arizona Press; [2] Turcotte (1993) JGR; [3] Kiefer (2013) LPSC; [4] Lee et al.

            "abstract": "Increasing complexity of Earth’s inner core has been revealed in recent decades as the global distribution of seismic stations has improved. The uneven distribution of earthquakes, however, still causes a biased geographical sampling of the inner core. A recent development in seismic interferometry, which allows for the retrieval of core-sensitive body waves propagating between two receivers, potentially significantly improves ray-path coverage across the inner core. In this study, we apply such earthquake coda interferometry to 1,846 USArray stations deployed across the US from 2004 through 2013. Clear PKIKP2 and PKIIKP2 arrivals, which are near-podal inner-core phases that bounce off the far side of the Earth’s surface, are observed across the entire array. Spatial analysis of the differential travel times between the two phases reveals a strong N-S trending anomaly across the middle of the continent. This finding implies the existence of strong short-wavelength structural variability that reflects an imperfect symmetry in the hemispheric structure of the inner core.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the flow of ice in glaciers and large grounded ice sheets is of increasing importance as climate change moves to the forefront of modern scientific investigation. The highly anisotropic visco-plasticity of ice leads to development of strong C-axis orientation fabrics (COF's). In ice undergoing uni-axial shortening at high homologous temperatures, mechanisms operate to reduce stored strain energy and lead to the concentration of crystallographic c-axes into fabrics diagnostic of the stress and strain regime. This imparts an acoustic anisotropy that manifests as en-glacial reflectivity under seismic investigation on large ice sheets.\nThis presentation provides an overview of results from two unique sets of experiments: Ultrasonic measurements which monitor the development of acoustic anisotropy in deforming ice in real time and Resonant Ultrasound Experiments that quantify the relationship between elastic properties, velocity and temperature. These results are compared to and supported by models derived from Cryo-EBSD data sets collected from the experimental samples. Here we show how velocity anisotropy evolves as a function of strain and fabric evolution and explore the implications of these results for large scale seismic investigations of ice sheets.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires alter the natural hydrologic processes within a watershed. After vegetation is burned, the combustion of organic material and debris settles into the soil creating a hydrophobic layer beneath the soil surface with varying degree of thickness and depth. Vegetation regrowth rates vary as a function of radiative exposure, burn severity, and precipitation patterns. Hydrologic models used by the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams use input data and model calibration constraints that are generally either one-dimensional, empirically-based models, or two-dimensional, conceptually-based models with lumped parameter distributions. These models estimate runoff measurements at the watershed outlet; however, do not provide a distributed hydrologic simulation at each point within the watershed. This work uses ParFlow, a three-dimensional, distributed hydrologic model to (1) correlate burn severity with hydrophobicity, (2) evaluate vegetation recovery rate on water components, and (3) improve flood prediction for managers to help with resource allocation and management operations in burned watersheds. ParFlow is applied to Devil Canyon (43 km2) in San Bernardino, California, which was 97% burned in the 2003 Old Fire. The model set-up uses a 30m-cell size resolution over a 6.7 km by 6.4 km lateral extent. The subsurface reaches 30 m and is assigned a variable cell thickness. Variable subsurface thickness allows users to explicitly consider the degree of recovery throughout the stages of regrowth. Burn severity maps from remotely sensed imagery are used to assign initial hydrophobic layer parameters and thickness. Vegetation regrowth is represented with satellite an Enhanced Vegetation Index. Pre and post-fire hydrologic response is evaluated using runoff measurements at the watershed outlet, and using water component (overland flow, lateral flow, baseflow) measurements.",

This study developed the probable rainfall database from weather radar data, and analyzed the potential correlation between the landslide magnitude-frequency and the recurrence interval of the heavy rainfall across Japan. We analyzed 4,744 rainfall-induced landslides (Saito et al., 2014, Geology), 1 to 72 h rainfalls, and soil water index (SWI). We then estimated recurrence intervals for these rainfall parameters using a Gumbel distribution with jackknife fitting. Results showed that the recurrence intervals of rainfall events which caused landslides (<10^3 m^3) were less than 10 yr across Japan. The recurrence intervals increased with increases in landslide volumes. With regard to the landslides larger than 10^5 m^3, recurrence intervals of the rainfall events were more than 100 yr. These results suggest that recurrence intervals of heavy rainfalls are important for assessing regional landslide hazard in Japan.",

            "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of carbon isotope records (as well as accurate characterization of the modern carbon cycle, e.g., in soils) relies on reliably separating organic carbon (Corg) from carbonate-derived carbon (Ccarb). These fractions are characterized by very different isotope composition, so small carbonate contamination can strongly bias Corg results, and vice versa. Several criteria must be met for accurate %C and d13C analysis. In the case of analyzing Corg, these include: (1) Ccarb must be removed through a process called “decarbonation.” (2) Ccarb can be removed by acid dissolution, but if the acid is too strong then the Corg itself may solubilize, causing inaccurate results. (3) The preparation process for decarbonation can also unintentionally add carbon to samples and create a methodological blank that also will bias results.\nThis study tested decarbonation methods with the above criteria in mind. The focus was on (i) heated treatment with weak liquid acid, e.g., 1M HCl (“liquid phase decarbonation”) and (ii) heated treatment with vapor from concentrated acid (“vapor phase decarbonation”). Our results confirm that heated treatment is critical to producing reliable records; recalcitrant carbonate phases are not removed during room temperature decarbonation and can bias carbon isotope values. Vapor phase decarbonation may prevent loss in solution that is known to occur using liquid phase methods. However, our results show that blanks must be very carefully monitored and can be a concern during vapor phase treatment. Moreover, we still observe some loss of organics during vapor phase treatment, as evidenced by changes in Corg and d13C with length of reaction time. The length of vapor phase treatment must be carefully considered depending on the type of sample being tested. Overall, our work emphasizes the importance of carefully considering sample-specific decarbonation methodology in order to produce reliable values for %Corg and d13C.",

            "abstract": "Intense tropical cyclones (TCs) accompanying heavy rainfall and destructive wind gusts sometimes cause incredible socio-economic damages in the regions near their landfall. This study aims to analyze intense TC activities in the North Atlantic (NA) and the western North Pacific (WNP) basins and develop their track propensity seasonal prediction model. Considering that the number of TCs in the NA basin is much smaller than that in the WNP basin, different intensity criteria are used; category 1 and above for NA and category 3 and above for WNP based on Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. By using a fuzzy clustering method, intense TC tracks in the NA and the WNP basins are classified into two and three representative patterns, respectively. Each pattern shows empirical relationships with climate variabilities such as sea surface temperature distribution associated with El Niño/La Niña or Atlantic Meridional Mode, Pacific decadal oscillation, upper and low level zonal wind, and strength of subtropical high. The hybrid statistical-dynamical method has been used to develop the seasonal prediction model for each pattern based on statistical relationships between the intense TC activity and seasonal averaged key predictors. The model performance is statistically assessed by cross validation for the training period (1982–2013) and has been applied for the 2014 and 2015 prediction. This study suggests applicability of this model to real prediction work and provide bridgehead of attempt for intense TC prediction.",

Since the epicenter is located in a relatively low background seismicity area, we want to investigate seismicity rate changes associated with the Jiashian mainshock by applying the region-time-length (RTL) algorithm. The temporal RTL function shows that, for the epicenter area, a seismic quiescence stage appeared during 2007-2009, and then the seismic activation stage started just few months before the mainshock and continued for almost 2 years. On the other hand, the spatial distribution also indicates that the mainshock occurred on the edge of seismic quiescence area. In addition, quiescence patches correspond to the region with Coulomb stress drop during the same period. Therefore, our study suggests that the epicenter area of the 2010 Jiashian earthquake experienced a long period of seismic quiescence followed by a short period of seismic activation before the mainshock.",

            "abstract": "Nighttime lights are typically used as a proxy for population and economic growth, yet they can also reveal socioeconomic decline. We use two night light datasets to infer socioeconomic patterns and trends in the Russian Far East, Northeast China, and North Korea, a cross-border region impacted by the 1991 collapse of the USSR. First, using the annual stable light composites from the DMSP/OLS satellites, we find that generally, nighttime lights declined in the Russian Far East, increased in Northeast China, and fluctuated in North Korea between 1992 and 2012. By 2012, lighting in most of the Russian Far East had not recovered to 1992 levels. In Northeast China, a government revitalization program may have increased lighting during the mid-2000s, suggesting sensitivity of remotely sensed nighttime lights to regional development policies. Yet caveats with DMSP/OLS data include low spatial and radiometric resolutions, saturation, and blooming. The Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Suomi NPP satellite, however, launched in October 2011, has higher quality, enabling improved monitoring of socioeconomic trends in the region. For our second night lights dataset, we use both nightly images and monthly DNB composites to make inferences regarding socioeconomic activities at finer spatial and temporal resolutions from 2012-2015. Cross-border activity in particular emerges in finer detail, allowing us to examine specific transport corridors and sites of industrial and natural resource production that involve both Russian and Chinese partners.",

            "abstract": "High elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range show signs of eutrophication due to increased phosphorus loading. Phosphorus is a major contributing factor to freshwater lake eutrophication when in excess. Three previously researched sources of phosphorus to high-elevation montane lakes include atmospheric deposition, internal loading from sediments, and excretions from non-native stocked fish. The goal of this research was to isolate the estimated phosphorus contributions from residential shoreline developments and stocked non-native fish. A steady-state phosphorus loading rate model was created to quantify relative phosphorus loading into two lakes in the Eastern Sierra Nevada: Convict and Silver Lake. A conglomerate control lake was created from Eastern Brook Lake in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, Pear Lake in the Southern Sierra Nevada, and Snowflake Lake in Canada. Both Convict and Silver Lakes contain stocked non-native trout species and Silver Lake also has ~25 vacation homes on its eastern shore. Seasonal steady-state total phosphorus concentrations were determined using EPA Method 365.2. Loading rate constants were calculated using loading rates from literature and corresponding concentrations. It was determined that as much as 42% of phosphorous to Silver Lake came from shoreline housing developments, and 24% came from stocked fish depending on the season. Previous studies showed much lower contributions from non-native fish.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater-age data derived from sampled tracer concentrations are recognized as essential characterization and prediction tools in hydrogeology. They give characteristic transit time information as well as indications on aquifer structures and exchanges. Information can however be difficult to extract and often requires additional knowledge on the flow patterns or on the geological heterogeneity that can guide the choice of the interpretation framework. Any constrain on transit times concerning their distribution facilitates greatly the interpretation.\nGroundwater flow and transport models help in characterizing potential transit time distributions. This has been extensively done in heterogeneous porous and fractured media. Upscaling local pore and Darcy transport processes to some 100m-scale generic breakthrough curves underline the importance of extended tailing (long transit times of several decades to centuries). Shorter transit times from months to decades are also sensitive to recharge variability, catchment topography, aquifer exchanges and sampling conditions. Large-scale calibrated models integrating these different constrains are of high interest to assess the information content of GroundWater age data.\nResults on a limited number of case studies confirm that the atmospheric tracers of the last 50 years give accurate estimates of cumulative residence times and of the transport fate of some contaminants like nitrates. It already appears that the quality of the prediction does not always come from the capacity of the transit-time model to fit the actual transit-time distribution but also from the nature of the prediction or of the hydrological regime. Access to a wide range of well-informed and calibrated models taken as synthetic references should be developed to confirm and refine these early conclusions.",

            "abstract": "Earth System Models (ESMs) used to project future biosphere-climate feedbacks rely on predictions of terrestrial carbon dynamics. Furthermore, soil nutrient availability strongly modulates land surface carbon dynamics, including plant sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Plant growth under future environmental changes (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus deposition) depends on how well plants compete with microbial and abiotic competitors.\nHere, we surveyed recent developments of nutrient competition representations in ESMs that participated in the CMIP5 project. We found that nutrient competition is over-simplified despite its ecological significance. Existing ESMs either assume that soil-decomposing microbes (1) outcompete plants or (2) are evenly competitive, both of which are inconsistent with theoretical understanding and field observations.\nWe compiled and synthesized global data of forest carbon productivity in response to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization experiments. Using this synthesis, we show that existing ESMs with the first and second competition schemes lead to underestimation and overestimation, respectively, of fertilization effects on plant growth. We reduced these systematic biases by applying a new competition scheme in CLM4.5 and the essentially equivalent ACME land model (ALMv0) based on the Equilibrium Chemistry Approximation, which is based on classical equilibrium chemical kinetics theory. This approach dynamically updates nutrient competitiveness among multiple consumers (e.g., plants, decomposing microbes, nitrifier, denitrifier, mineral surfaces) as a function of soil nutrient status. There has been a long-term debate regarding how to implement theoretically realistic and computationally efficient nutrient competition schemes in ESMs. Our approach reconciles the complex nature of ecosystem nutrient competition with a computationally tractable approach applicable to ESMs. More importantly, our results imply that previous estimates of plant biomass production in response to nutrient deposition might be systematically biased.",

            "abstract": "In order to emphasis their interest for earth sciences, an outreach program through measurements of frost depth is conducting in Japan since 2011. This program is made at elementary, junior high and high schools in Hokkaido, northern part of Japan where seasonal ground freezing occurs in winter. At schools, a lecture was made and a frost tube was set at schoolyard, as the same tube and protocol as UAF’s Permafrost Outreach Program, using clear tube with blue-colored water. Frost depth was measured directly once a week at each school by students during ground freezing under no snow-removal condition. In 2011 season, we started this program at three schools, and the number of participated school is extended to 29 schools in 2014 winter season, 23 elementary schools, 5 junior high schools and one high school. We visited schools summer time and just before frost season to talk about the method of measurement. After the end of measured period, we also visited schools to explain measured results by each school and the other schools in Japan, Alaska, Canada and Russia. The measured values of frost depth in Hokkaido were ranged between 0cm and more than 50cm. We found that the frost depth depends on air temperature and snow depth. We discussed with student why the frost depth ranged widely and explained the effect of snow by using the example of igloo. In order to validate the effect of snow and to compare frost depths, we tried to measure frost depths under snow-removal and no snow-removal conditions at one elementary school. At the end of December, depths had no significant difference between these conditions, 11cm and 10cm, and the difference went to 14cm, 27cm and 13cm after one month, with about 30cm of snow depth. After these measurements and lectures, students noticed snow has a role as insulator and affects the frost depth. The network of this program will be expected to expand, finally more than a hundred schools.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) was launched in 2009 to measure the global atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. GOSAT is equipped with two sensors: the Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) and the Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI). The presence of clouds in the instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) of the FTS leads to incorrect estimates of the concentrations. Thus, the FTS data which are suspected to be cloud-contaminated must be identified using a CAI cloud discrimination algorithm and rejected. Conversely, overestimation of clouds leads to reduce the amount of the FTS data which can be used to estimate the greenhouse gases concentrations. It becomes a serious problem in the region of tropical rainforest such as the Amazon, where there are very few remaining FTS data by cloud cover.\nThe preparation for the launch of the GOSAT-2 in fiscal 2017 has been progressing. To improve the accuracy of estimates of the greenhouse gases concentrations, we need to refine the existing CAI cloud discrimination algorithm. For the reason, a new cloud discrimination algorithm using support vector machines (SVM) was developed. Visual inspections can use the locally optimized thresholds, though the existing CAI cloud discrimination algorithm uses the common thresholds all over the world. Thus, it is certain that the accuracy of visual inspections is better than these algorithms in the limited region without areas such as ice and snow, where it is difficult to discriminate between clouds and ground surfaces. In this study we evaluated the accuracy of the new cloud discrimination algorithm by comparing with the existing CAI cloud discrimination algorithm and visual inspections of the same CAI images in the Amazon. We will present our latest results.",

The model is calibrated to determine the spatial deviations in runoff at sub-basin level, and to capture the water balance of the river basin. Manual calibration approach was used for calibrating the SWAT model by following multi-step procedure to get to the realistic present situation as close as possible. Simulations were then further made with and without proposed future projects to obtain various scenarios. The various statistical parameters used for the evaluation of the monthly runoff simulation showed that SWAT performed well in mimicking the monthly stream flow for Ganga River basin. The model under predicted the flows in the non-perennial region during non-monsoon season, due to low rainfall and regulated flows and seepage taking place from the reservoirs. The impacts of the interventions, both existing as well as proposed, on the water balance of the basin were evaluated and quantified. The derived results suggest that there is a substantial reduction in overall water resources availability in the study basin on account of the current level of development and further, future developments, as are being proposed, may require a careful study of their potential impact on currently sanctioned water use. The present study showcases that efficacy of the model for simulating the stream flow is admirable.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to describe how a teaching assistant (TA) in an undergraduate geology laboratory employs a multimodal system in order to mediate the students’ understanding of scientific knowledge and develop a contextualization of a concept in three-dimensional space and 2) to describe how a linguistic awareness of gestural patterns can be used to inform TA training assessment of students’ conceptual understanding in situ. During the study the TA aided students in developing the conceptual understanding and reconstruction of a meteoric impact, which produces shatter cone formations. The concurrent use of speech, gesture, and physical manipulation of objects is employed by the TA in order to aid the conceptual understanding of this particular phenomenon. Using the methods of gestural analysis in works by Goldin-Meadow, 2000 and McNeill, 1992, this study describes the gestures of the TA and the students as well as the purpose and motivation of the meditational strategies employed by TA in order to build the geological concept in the constructed 3-dimensional space. Through a series of increasingly complex gestures, the TA assists the students to construct the forensic concept of the imagined 3-D space, which can then be applied to a larger context. As the TA becomes more familiar with the students’ meditational needs, the TA adapts teaching and gestural styles to meet their respective ZPDs (Vygotsky 1978). This study shows that in the laboratory setting language, gesture, and physical manipulation of the experimental object are all integral to the learning and demonstration of scientific concepts. Recognition of the gestural patterns of the students allows the TA the ability to dynamically assess the students understanding of a concept. Using the information from this example of student-TA interaction, a brief short course has been created to assist TAs in recognizing the mediational power as well as the assessment potential of gestural awareness in classroom settings and will be test-run in the fall 2015 semester. This presentation will describe classroom interaction data, the design of the short course, and the implementation/ results of this module.",

            "abstract": "In a lot of geological environments, permeability is dominated by the existence of fractures and by their degree of interconnections. Flow properties depend mainly on the statistical properties of the fracture population (length, apertures, orientation), on the network topology, as well as on some detailed properties within fracture planes. None of them can be a priori discarded as fracture networks are potentially close to some percolation threshold. Still, most details are strongly homogenized by the inherent diffusive nature of flows. It should thus be possible to upscale permeability on the basis of a limited number of descriptors.\nBased on an extensive analysis of 2D and 3D DFNs as well as on reference connectivity structures, we investigate the relation between the local fracture structures and the effective permeability. On one hand poor connectivity, small intersections and fracture closures limit permeability. If these patterns control flow, permeability would derive from a suite of fracture in series dominated by its weakest element. Effective permeability could then be approached by the harmonic mean of the local permeabilities. On the other hand, extended fractures and locally higher fracture densities, enhance permeability. If these patterns control flow, all fractures would take equally part to flow and effective permeability would tend to the arithmetic mean of the local permeabilities.\nDefined as the relative weight between the two extreme harmonic and arithmetic means, the power-law averaging exponent gives a compact way to compare fracture network hydraulics. It may further lead to some comprehensive upscaling rules. Permeability is not only determined by global connectivity but also by more local effects. We measure them by defining a local connectivity index equal to the number of fracture connections at some reference local scale. Knowledge of the relative local to global effects should help optimizing characterization strategies.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the MJO and PNA-like pattern is examined by reconstructing each term in streamfunction equation using the output of the atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) simulation. In the result of simulations performed with a single diabatic forcing along the equator, it is found that the negative PNA-like pattern is clearly evident when either diabatic heating near 50°E-100°E or diabatic cooling near 130°E-160°W is forced. This indicates that both tropical forcing which corresponds to the MJO have its significant role on the PNA-like pattern formation. The required time to form this pattern is different depending on the location of tropical forcing and this difference is the key of the pattern maintenance. The tropical forcing-induced divergent wind anomalies mainly contribute to the generation of the Rossby Wave Source (RWS)and the barotropic Rossby wave emitted from the RWS anomalies propagates into the extratropics based on the vorticity perturbation advection by the climatological rotational wind.\nFurthermore, the relationship between the MJO and PNA-like pattern depends on the condition of basic state modified by ENSO. In La Niña years with a northward-heading exit of jet, the Rossby wave induces strong and clear propagation pattern, while in El Niñoyears when the exit of jet is biased to the south the generated pattern is vague. These results help better understanding of the MJO-PNA teleconnection and contribute to the improvement of the weather forecast on the intraseasonal time scale.",

            "abstract": "The operation of cascade reservoirs involves multiple objectives, including flood control, hydropower generation and ecosystem protection. For many reservoirs with the main objective of hydropower generation, environmental flow is usually an important constraint. In this paper，we take the cascade reservoirs of the Lancang River, i.e., the Nuozadu reservoir, Jinghong reservoir and Ganlanba reservoir, as a case to develop a cascade reservoir operation model for hydropower-environmental flow tradeoff analysis. The results show that there exists a clear competition relationship between the maximizing of hydropower generation and the minimizing of environmental flow alteration. With the increase of hydropower generation, the alteration of environmental inflow increases, and vice versa. The competition relationship between them shows significant nonlinear characteristics. When the environmental flow alteration index, ε, ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, small change of ε results in significant change of hydropower generation, which shows that this is a sensitive window to balance the tradeoff between hydropower generation and environmental flow. Additionally, compared with the natural river flow regime, hydropower operation changes the frequency of high flow pulse and small flood, which can be improved by increasing artificial flood in operation rules.",

            "abstract": "Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a small but crucial part of the forest carbon cycle. Characterizing the relationship between organic matter inputs to soil and DOC chemistry is crucial to understanding the ultimate fate of root carbon, fallen wood and needles. Chemical differences in the DOC pool may help to explain whether fractions are sorbed to mineral surfaces and contribute to accumulation of soil organic carbon, respired as CO2, or exported. Soil solution DOC was sampled from the detrital input and removal treatment (DIRT) plots located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR to determine whether detrital inputs impart a detectable signal on DOC in mineral soil. Multiple types of fresh litter extracts, along with lysimeter and soil extracts from DIRT treatment plots were characterized using UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with the Cory and McKnight (2005) parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model. Principal component analysis of 13 unique fluorophores distinguished using PARAFAC show that litter and soil extracts (needles, wood of decomposition Class 1, Class 3 and Class 5, O-horizon, and A-horizon) each have distinct fluorescence signatures. However, while litter-leached DOC chemistry varies by litter type, neither lysimeter-collected DOC or soil extracts show statistically significant differences in fluorescence signatures among treatments, even after 17 years of litter manipulations. The lack of observed differences among DIRT treatments suggests a “Soil Blender” hypothesis whereby both abiotic and biotic mechanisms effectively homogenize organic carbon constituents within the dissolved pool. The results of this work emphasize the ability of sorption and biodegradation to homogenize soil DOC and demonstrate that fluorescence can be an effective fingerprinting technique for soil DOC composition.",

            "abstract": "The Central Asian Orogenic Belt is located between the Siberia, Tarim, and North China cratons. It considered to have been the site of the largest Phanerozoic continental growth on Earth, and to have formed by the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and the amalgamation of various terranes. However, it remains debated whether the southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian oceanic plate beneath the Songnen terrane happened during late Paleozoic time. In this paper, we undertook zircon U-Pb dating and geochemical analyses of late Paleozoic volcanics from the Dashizhai Formation exposed along the subduction zone to the north, with the aim of resolving the above question.\nZircons from six samples are euhedral–subhedral, and display oscillatory growth zoning in CL images, indicating a magmatic origin. The analytical results demonstrate an early Permian magmatism in the Songnen terrane, with ages of 283 to 295 Ma. The Permian volcanic rocks are composed of rhyolite tuff, rhyolite, dacite, andesite, basaltic andesite, basaltic trachyandesite, and basalt. Geochemically, they belong to the mid-K calc-alkaline series, and are characterized by enrichment in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements, and depletion in high field strength elements (such as Ni, and Ta). Moreover, the in situ Hf isotopic data of zircons from the rhyolites show positive εHf(t) values and two-stage model ages of 1396–551 Ma. Taken together, the acidic volcanic rocks were most likely derived from the partial melting of accreted Meso–Neoproterozoic lower crust. In contrast, the basic to intermediate volcanics were derived from the partial melting of a depleted lithospheric mantle that had been metasomatized by fluids derived from a subducted slab. Therefore, we conclude that the Permian volcanic rocks in the Songnen terrane could be generated under an active continental margin related to the southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian oceanic plate beneath the Songnen terrane.",

The high Hawaiian fountains erupted at Pu`u `Ō`ō varied in height from 200 m up to a maximum of 467 m, during which the shallow conduit at Pu`u `Ō`ō remained stable. We conducted microtextural analysis of pyroclasts from five high (264 to 391 m) Hawaiian fountaining episodes at Kīlauea, Episodes 32, 37, 40, 44 and 45, erupted from the Pu`u `Ō`ō vent between 1985 and 1986 in order to constrain the parameters that lead to large variations in fountain height of Hawaiian fountains at Pu`u `Ō`ō. Our results show that pyroclasts from a single episode can vary greatly in texture (from bubbly to foamy) and have vesicle volume densities (Nmv) that vary by an order of magnitude. This range in vesicle texture and population is due to extensive growth and coalescence of vesicles within the eruption jet post-fragmentation, resulting in the observed vesicle texture not being wholly indicative of the syn-fragmentation vesicle population. Only four pyroclasts were found to have textures that are interpreted to be indicative of the vesicle population at the moment of fragmentation, all of which have bubbly texture, high density, high Nmv, and low vesicle-to-melt ratio (VG/VL). Due to the paucity of pyroclasts representative of syn-eruption vesiculation processes, comparison of shallow conduit dynamics across episodes can only be qualitative observations, which suggest the ascending melt is thermally and mechanically heterogeneous on a small scale during Hawaiian-style fountaining. This highlights the importance for detailed micro-scale qualitative textural observations on pyroclasts with end-member densities, as well as modal densities, when carrying out vesicle microtexture analysis. This will ensure that a sufficient number of pyroclasts with textures representative of the syn-fragmentation vesicle population are identified, in order to carry out quantitative comparisons across episodes.",

            "abstract": "The Jurassic tectonic evolution and dynamic setting of the eastern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), however, remains controversial; some workers propose it was dominated by the subduction of the Paleo–Pacific oceanic plate, others suggest it experienced southwards subduction of the Mongol–Okhotsk oceanic plate. Thus, we undertook zircon U–Pb dating and geochemical analyses of the Jurassic intermediate–acidic intrusions in the Xing’an Block, with the aim of addressing the above mentioned question. Zircon U–Pb age dating demonstrates three stages of Jurassic magmatism in the study area: 180–177 Ma, 171–170 Ma, and ~151 Ma. Early Jurassic acidic rocks are dominated by calc–alkaline I–type granitoids containing high SiO2 and total Na2O+K2O, and are characterized by enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and depletion in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and high field strength elements (HFSEs; e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti, and P), indicating they formed in a subduction–related setting. Middle Jurassic intermediate–acidic rocks comprise two suites (Tuanjie and Shijing plutons), and the Tuanjie pluton was likely derived from partial melting of a depleted mantle wedge that was subsequently metasomatized by subduction–related fluids, suggesting that subduction–related processes indeed occurred beneath the study area in the Middle Jurassic. The rocks of Shijing pluton show geochemical affinities to rocks that form in subduction zones, with enrichment in LREEs and depletion in HREEs and Ba, Sr, Eu, Nb, Ta, P, Ti. Late Jurassic acidic intrusions contain high SiO2, Na2O+K2O, and Al2O3, and are strongly depleted in HREEs, indicating the magma was likely derived from partial melting of thickened crustal material, possibly caused by subduction–related processes. According to these findings and previous studies, we conclude that generation of the Jurassic intermediate–acidic intrusions in the study area was related to the subduction of the Paleo–Pacific oceanic plate.",

The results show that the seasonal cycle of river discharge is generally modelled well in the low and mid latitudes, but not in the high latitudes, where the peak discharge (due to snow and ice melting) is underestimated. For the annual mean discharge, the DGVMs chained with the routing model show an underestimation. Furthermore the 30-year trend of discharge is also under-estimated. For the inter-annual variability of discharge, a skill score based on overlapping of probability density functions (PDFs) suggests that most models correctly reproduce the observed variability (correlation coefficient higher than 0.5; i.e. models account for 50% of observed inter-annual variability) except for the Lena, Yenisei, Yukon, and the Congo river basins. In addition, we compared the simulated runoff from different simulations where models were forced with either fixed or varying land use. This suggests that both seasonal and annual mean runoff has been little affected by land use change, but that the trend itself of runoff is sensitive to land use change. None of the models when considered individually show significantly better performances than any other and in all basins. This suggests that based on current modelling capability, a regional-weighted average of multi-model ensemble projections might be appropriate to reduce the bias in future projection of global river discharge.",

Only after decaying of the LPCR lightning the stepped leader makes its path to the ground. Polarized water droplets also have a role in the TGE initiation. Our observations show that only at high humidity the TGEs at Aragats are possible and rains terminate the particle fluxes. We consider TGE events abruptly terminated by the lightning discharge.

In this study we investigated the dynamics of electrons interacting with whistler mode waves using a two-dimensional relativistic, electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code. Acceleration of electrons occurs by two different resonance mechanisms. For small values of whistler waves propagate obliquely across the background magnetic field, and significant part of the wave electric field is electrostatic. The electrostatic field can accelerate a portion of electrons along the magnetic field through Landau resonance. On the other hand, gyro-resonance can occur for some electrons by the right-handed polarized whistler waves and accelerate them perpendicular to the magnetic field. Interestingly, the two resonances become dominant over each other alternately in time. The electrons resonant with the whistler waves are initially located in specific regions in velocity space. Only a few percent of the total electrons resonantly interact with the waves. However, the resonant interaction produces supra-thermal tail along the velocity parallel to the magnetic field.",

An efficient system that can lower the installation cost should be developed and evaluated for its performance in order to expand the growth of GSHP system in Japan. In addition, development of suitability map to assess appropriate locations for the system installation is essential for optimum design and sustainability. In this study, GSHP system was constructed utilizing an artesian well as ground heat exchanger (GHE) and evaluated its performance. The objective of this study is to develop low cost and high efficiency system. In areas with abundant groundwater and its flow, higher heat exchange rate can be expected leading to cost reduction and energy saving. Further, suitability map was prepared in regional scale to assess the suitable locations where this type of system can be installed. The suitability map was prepared considering local hydrogeological and thermal data. Average coefficient of performance (COP) was found to be 7 during space-cooling operation and 5 during space-heating operation.

            "abstract": "Numerical simulations of earthquakes enable a careful inspection of dynamic processes and effects which are overlooked in static source representation and ground shaking predictions. Such simulations illuminate patterns of transient stress and seismic wave radiation during rupture propagation and arrest, and they highlight important effects such as rupture directivity. Comparing standard calculations of shaking patterns with those based on dynamic rupture simulations reveals great discrepancies in the shaking intensity and distribution. Observations of asymmetric intensity patterns in various earthquakes also support the need to account for dynamic effects and heterogeneities in future hazard analyses. Simulations with material heterogeneities and interfaces also yield insights into surprising rupture observations such as remotely triggered seismicity and rupture jumps over large stepover zones. Presented here are two case studies of simple applications of dynamic rupture models in seismic hazard studies. First, a simple but robust procedure is proposed to account for the dynamic directivity effect in ground motion maps calculated using a static line source model. The procedure includes characterising shaking amplification patterns in a range of dynamic rupture models and comparing them with ground motion maps derived using common seismic hazard software. We find that the area in which any certain PGA level is expected is greatly underestimated if calculations are based on static point/line source models. We demonstrate this with results from a seismic hazard study of Eilat, Israel. We also present dynamic rupture simulations used in an analysis of plausible and maximal rupture lengths expected along Dead Sea Transform. Evaluating geophysical and geomorphological data from two large stepovers we assess if a large multi-segment earthquake is likely in light of numeric results that show how heterogeneities and dynamic effects enable large rupture jumps.",

Mainly, the following two questions have been addressed and accordingly the algorithm has been developed and evaluated:\nCan simple geostationary satellite based SRE’s perform equivalent to merged techniques which uses all the available satellite datasets? If so/not so, then how best it can perform? \nWhether SRE’s perform differently over different climate regions? Whether incorporating topography in SRE will improve the performance equally over all climate regions? \nM-IMSRA incorporates topographic information in the IMSRA (INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm) algorithm using 20 different variables extracted from Digital Elevation Model by using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique. The results show that the simple algorithms like M-IMSRA can perform similar to the other highly computationally expensive merged algorithms like TRMM 3B42 and TRMM 3B42-RT over some climatic regions of India. It has been observed that, by incorporating static topographic information the estimates over orographic regions of India like Western Ghats and North-East India has significantly improved with only reduction in the additive bias over other regions. Relative performance of the tested satellite rainfall estimates like TRMM 3B42, TRMM 3B42-RT and M-IMSRA are completely different over different climatic regions, with better performance over moderate rainfall climate regions and relatively poor performance over low and high rainfall climate regions. The obtained results highlight that only one algorithm with same input variables cannot produce better rainfall estimates over all the climatic regions where the driving variables for each region will be different. Therefore, the imminent development of SRE’s must give attention to this fact and consider this to be of vital importance to develop different algorithms for different climate regions separately.",

The incorporation of Al into bridgmanite significantly raises the electrical conductivity but it is small conductivity variation with respect to the amount of Al. Synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy of recovered samples showed a significant amount of ferric iron in aluminous bridgmanite. The mobility of charge carriers in bridgmanite was calculated from the conductivity and Fe3+/ΣFe. A relation between the logarithm of electrical conductivity and reciprocal temperature is consistent with Fe2+-Fe3+ electron hopping (small polaron) as the dominant conduction mechanism at low temperatures (< 1400 K) and ionic conduction at high temperatures (> 1600 K). Taking various conduction mechanisms into account, we develop an electrical conductivity model for aluminous bridgmanite as a function of Al and Fe content. This conductivity model suggests that the electrical conductivity of aluminous bridgmanite has a maximum at around 0.13 Al per formula unit, and further increase of Al in bridgmanite reduces the conductivity. The conductivity increase observed in the uppermost lower mantle by electromagnetic studies can be explained by increases of Fe and Na content in combination with substitution of Al into bridgmanite with increasing pressure due to the gradual decomposition of majorite garnet.",

            "abstract": "Slip inversion methods differ in how the rupture model is parameterized and which regularizations or constraints are applied. However, there is still no consensus about which of the slip inversion methods are preferable and how reliable the inferred source models are due to the non-uniqueness or ill-posedness of the inverse problem. The ‘Source Inversion Validation’ (SIV) initiative aims to characterize and understand the performance of slip inversion methods (http://equake-rc.info/SIV/). Up to now, four benchmark test cases have been proposed, some of which were even conducted as blind tests. The next step is performing quantitative comparisons of the inverted rupture models. To this aim, we introduce a new comparison technique based on a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the design matrix of the continuum inverse problem. We separate the range and null sub-spaces (representing resolved and unresolved features, respectively) by a selected ‘cut-off’ singular value, and compare different inverted models to the target (exact) model after projecting them on the range sub-space. This procedure effectively quantifies the ability of an inversion result to reproduce the resolvable features of the source. We find that even with perfect Green’s functions the quality of an inverted model deteriorates with decreasing cut-off singular value due to applied regularization (smoothing and positivity constraints). Applying this approach to the inversion results of the SIV2a benchmark from various authors shows that the inferred source images are very similar to the target model when we consider a cut-off at ~1/10 of the largest singular value. Although the truncated model captures the overall rupture propagation, the final slip is biased significantly, showing distinct peaks below the stations lying above the rupture. We also show synthetic experiments to assess the role of station coverage, crustal velocity model, etc. on the conditioning of the slip inversion.",

            "abstract": "Recent analysis of Enceladus’s gravity and topography has suggested that the thickness of the ice shell significantly varies laterally - from 30-40 km in the south polar region to 60 km elsewhere. These variations may influence the activity of the geysers and increase the tidal heat production in regions where the ice shell is thinned. Using a model including a regional or global subsurface ocean and Maxwell viscoelasticity, we investigate the impact of these variations on the tidal deformation of the moon and its heat production. For that purpose, we use different numerical approaches - finite elements, local application of 1d spectral method, and a generalized spectral method. Results obtained with these three approaches for various models of ice-shell thickness variations are presented and compared. Implications of a reduced ice shell thickness for the south polar terrain activity are discussed.",

The induced magnetosphere around 67P/CG reacts to this sudden mass loading: first there is an increase in the total magnetic field strength and an increase in fluctuations. Low frequency oscillations (f ≤ 10 mHz) are observed. In the early hours 0000 – 0400 UT of 7 June 2015 the plasma density returns to its pre-outburst value, and the magnetic field strength also returns, however the fluctuations in the magnetic field remain strong. Structures reminiscent of mirror mode waves- strong decreases in Bmag associated with strong Langmuir probe currents (proxy for density) – have also been detected starting at 2300 UTC 6 June and seem to evolve into structures with one steeper side. Wavelet analysis over the whole event shows that below 20 mHz there are several dominant frequencies, but different magnetic field components have different spectral content, implying strong polarization of the waves/oscillations.",

            "abstract": "On 24 August 2014 an Mw 6.1 earthquake struck the Napa area in the north San Francisco Bay region. We perform slip inversion using method by Gallovič et al. (2015), employing low frequency data (0.05-0.5 Hz) recorded by 10 near-fault strong-motion stations and a 1D velocity model (GIL7). We reveal rupture propagating up-dip and unilaterally along the fault with dominant shallow asperity. While the fit of the data is good in terms of the first main pulses, the observed weaker secondary arrivals at some of the stations remain unexplained. We then perform forward simulation combining the revealed ‘1D’ source model and detailed 3D USGS velocity model of the Bay region. While the 3D crustal model slightly improves the fit at stations located outside of major basin structures, it introduces strong spurious reverberations at stations inside the basins. These strong oscillations disappear when the 3D velocity model is smoothed. We also perform slip inversion using 3D Green’s functions, obtaining a source model that effectively suppresses the oscillations, but also worsens the fit at stations outside the basins. Compared to the ‘1D’ rupture model, the ‘3D’ rupture model has longer rise times and lower peak slip rates, but it also contains more spurious features. Thus we conclude that the ‘1D’ rupture model is more robust, suggesting that the 3D USGS velocity model for the Bay area should be improved in some of its parts.\nAs a next step, based on the low-resolution slip models, we follow the approach of Ruiz (Ruiz et al., 2011) to build broadband kinematic source models to simulate deterministically ground motions up to 5Hz, including topography, intrinsic attenuation and random small-scale velocity heterogeneity. Calculations show an extremely complex wave field in comparison with 1D simulations. Finally, we check how our deterministic synthetics compare with those obtained using popular broadband hybrid techniques (e.g., Mai et al., 2010).",

            "abstract": "The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) spacecraft is providing new detailed observations of the Martian ionosphere thanks to its unique orbital coverage and its sophisticated instrument suite. From November 16 2014 to February 28 2015 its periapsis sampled the nightside Northern latitudes of Mars from 30° to 75° down to 125 km altitude above regions with and without significant crustal magnetic sources. On almost each periapsis in the nightside ionosphere suprathermal electron depletions were detected. A simple but robust criterion based on data recorded by the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) was implemented in order to detect all these electron depletions. This resulted in a dataset of 1742 depletions identified on 457 orbits among the 494 orbits where data were available during the time period under study. A statistical analysis reveals that the main ion and electron populations within the depletions are surprisingly constant in time and altitude. Absorption by CO2 is the main loss process for suprathermal electrons and electrons strongly peaked around 6 eV are resulting from this interaction. The observation of depletions appears however highly dependent on altitude. Depletions are mainly located above strong crustal magnetic sources above 170 km whereas the depletions observed for the first time below 170 km are globally scattered onto the Martian surface with no particular dependence on crustal fields. These results will be supplemented with new MAVEN data obtained above the southern hemisphere and will be contrasted with similar observations obtained from previous missions.",

            "abstract": "Improvements in computational power and data availability provided new opportunities for hydrological modeling. The increased complexity of hydrological models, however, also leads to time consuming optimization procedures. Moreover, observations are still required to calibrate the model. Both to decrease calculation time of the optimization and to be able to apply the model in poorly gauged basins, many studies have focused on transferability of parameters. We adopted a probabilistic approach to systematically investigate parameter transferability across both temporal and spatial resolution. A Variable Infiltration Capacity model for the Thur basin (1703km2, Switzerland) was set-up and run at four different spatial resolutions (1x1, 5x5, 10x10km, lumped) and three different temporal resolutions (hourly, daily, monthly). Three objective functions were used to evaluate the model: Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE(Q)), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE(Q)) and NSE(logQ). We used a Hierarchical Latin Hypercube Sample (Vorechovsky, 2014) to efficiently sample the most sensitive parameters. The model was run 3150 times and the best 1% of the runs was selected as behavioral.\nThe overlap in selected behavioral sets for different spatial and temporal resolutions was used as indicators for parameter transferability. There was a large overlap in selected sets for the different spatial resolutions, implying that parameters were to a large extent transferable across spatial resolutions. The temporal resolution, however, had a larger impact on the parameters; it significantly affected the parameter distributions for at least four out of seven parameters. The parameter values for the monthly time step were found to be substantially different from those for daily and hourly time steps. This suggests that the output from models which are calibrated on a monthly time step, cannot be interpreted or analysed on an hourly or daily time step. It was also shown that the selected objective function affected the transferability. There was more overlap in parameter values between the time steps when the model was evaluated with the NSE(logQ) rather than with the KGE(Q) or the NSE(Q). This suggests that parameter transferability across temporal resolutions also depends on the time scale of the process under study.",

            "abstract": "Globally, increasing demands on water resources along with climate variability and change have led to alarming declines and deterioration of terrestrial surface water resources. The usage of earth-observation data and techniques for modeling SWD and its drivers represents a promising approach for sustainable management and restoration of surface water resources across broad geographic regions. The main objective of this research was to model SWD with a focus on floods, observed in 25 years of Landsat imagery (1986 - 2011), across a large and highly regulated river basin, the MDB in Australia. SWD were modelled as a function of river flow and spatially explicit time‑series data on soil moisture (Climate Change Initiative active passive microwave), evapotranspiration (Australian Water Resources Assessment land surface model) and rainfall (gauge-based). To enable a consistent modeling approach within the complex hydrological structure of the river basin, a unique spatial modeling framework was developed based on a fully directed and connected stream network, a categorization of the basin into floodplain and non-floodplain area and a regular grid of 10 by 10 km cells. Based on this framework, SWD on local floodplain units were successfully related to flow data from connected gauges by quantifying the lag time for each cell. Dynamic regression models of SWD were fitted locally for floodplains in each grid cell, with an average adjusted r2 above 0.7. Validation against 10 years of test data that was left out for model fitting showed that the models can predict the test data with an average r2 of 0.7, which makes them suitable for improving the ongoing management and allocation of environmental flows in the MDB. The models also revealed the relative importance of local climate conditions for SWD, with increased importance of soil moisture, evapotranspiration and rainfall in arid regions, in proximity to headwater catchments and on slow‑draining floodplains.",

The new seismic and bathymetric data recently acquired allow describing in details the CDS on the DP. Erosional and syn-sedimentary features on the seafloor (comet tail, « longitudinal waves », contourite drifts and moats) have been observed, helping to constrain the sedimentary processes at the origin of the CDS construction. Also, the recovery and multi-proxy analysis of sediment cores allows the characterization of sedimentary environments and possible relation with climate forcing. These sediment cores are characterized by the presence of several beds rich in glauconite grains.\nGlauconite can form at the sediment/water interface by winnowing effect that prevent sediment deposition and increase the residence time at the seafloor. Under strong winnowing conditions, glauconite grains can develop at several stages of maturity. We observed that the residence time and hence the maturity of glauconite is reflected by the color changes (light to dark green), the presence of crack on grains, the formation of (secondary) glauconite lamellae and decrease of grain porosity. A chronological framework (based on radiocarbon dates and δ18O variations) of contourite sequences at the studied location indicates correlation with grain-size parameters (sortable silt) and allows one to further constrain their dynamics through time. The combination of these proxies allows us to estimate and understand the evolution and the impact of the bottom current on sedimentation on the DP during the last 80 ky. These results show the potentiality of the glauconite study to estimate the relative variation of bottom current velocity at margins.",

CHN scales the sum of turbulent heat fluxes and EF represents their partitioning. The VDA approach finds optimal values of CHN and EF by minimizing a cost function, which consists of the LST, air temperature, and specific humidity misfit terms and deviations of unknown parameters (CHN and EF) from their prior values. The model is tested over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment (FIFE) site. The results show that it can accurately estimate surface heat fluxes.",

A suite of sensitivity experiments are performed in a coupled free run format. Two parameters are found to lead to a significant improvement: a threshold of relative humidity of the boundary layer and a fraction of re-evaporation of convective precipitation. Increasing the strength of these two parameters increases a supply of water vapor and condensate from deep cumulus ensembles to environment in the lower troposphere (especially, 700 hPa), and reduces light rainfall amount that prevents complete organization of convective system. Under a more humid environment (or positive moisture–convection feedback), the space–time spectral signal, eastward propagation, tilted vertical structure of dynamic and thermodynamic variables associated with the MJO are more comparable to observations and a recharge–discharge theory.",

With the retreat of glaciers as currently observed in most mountain regions, understanding the quantity and timing of the meltwater is important for water resources management downstream. Hydrological model is a useful tool for estimating the present and future runoff response to a changing climate in the high-elevation and glacierized basins, yet the scarcity of meteorological observations restricts the predictive skill and accuracy of the hydrological models. In this work, 54 years (1960-2013) daily meteorological forcing data at 5km×5km spatial resolution were retrieved for the upper Yarkand river basin (5×104km2), a glacierized basin (11%) with high elevations in the Karakoram. The data construction was based on precipitation gradient (PG) and temperature laps rates (TLRs) observations from ten Rain Gauges and thirteen Temperature Probes installed in the basin during 2013-2014, together with the data from four national official meteorological stations. The derived forcing data was used to force the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) distributed land surface hydrological model linked with a degree-day glacier-melt model over the entire basin for 1960-2013. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the precipitation and temperature variability in this high mountain basin, 2) quantify the contributions of rainfall, snowmelt, and glacier melt to the upper Yarkand river basin.",

            "abstract": "Natural faults are expected to heat rapidly during seismic slip and to cool quite quickly after the event. Here we examine clumped isotope thermometry for its ability to identify short duration elevated temperature events along frictionally heated carbonate faults. This method is based on measured Δ47 values that indicate the relative atomic order of oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in the calcite lattice, which is affected by heat and thus can serve as a thermometer. We examine three types of calcite rock samples: (1) samples that were rapidly heated and then cooled in static laboratory experiments, simulating the temperature cycle experienced by fault rock during earthquake slip; (2) limestone samples that were experimentally sheared to simulate earthquake slip events; and (3) samples taken from principle slip zones of natural carbonate faults that likely experienced earthquake slip. Experimental results show that Δ47 values decrease rapidly (in the course of seconds) and systematically both with increasing temperature and shear velocity. On the other hand, carbonate shear zone from natural faults do not show such Δ47 reduction. We propose that the experimental Δ47 response is controlled by the presence of high-stressed nano-grains within the fault zone that can reduce the activation energy for diffusion by up to 60%, and thus lead to an increased rate of solid-state diffusion in the experiments. However, the lowering of activation energy is a double-edged sword in terms of clumped isotopes: In laboratory experiments, it allows for rapid disordering so that isotopic signal appears after very short heating, but in natural faults it also leads to relatively fast isotopic re-ordering after the cessation of frictional heating, thus erasing the high temperature signature in Δ47 values within relatively short geological times (<1 Ma).",

In Bangladesh, disasters from tropical cyclones are annual occurrences in coastal areas. The intensity and extent of damage due to tropical cyclones are very high. An appropriate mapping approach is essential for producing detail vulnerability assessments to deliver useful information for reducing the impacts of cyclones on people, property and environment. The present study developed and tested a vulnerability mapping approach for tropical cyclone impacts in Sarankhola upazila a 151 km2 local government area located in coastal Bangladesh. The study applied the approach by integrating remote sensing, field data and multi-criteria evaluation at regional scales covering <1000 km2. Seven criteria concerned with cyclone impacts were considered for the study: elevation, slope, geomorphology, proximity to coastline, proximity to cyclone track, land uses and population density. Thematic raster map layers were prepared for every criterion and weighted using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with sensitivity analysis. Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) technique was used for overlaying standardized criteria maps with their weights to produce the vulnerability map. Our results indicated that 15% of the study area had very high vulnerability; mostly close to the river and densely populated areas, with 40 % area as high vulnerability on cropped grounds. Around 25% area was classified at moderate vulnerability covering most of the forests. The low and very low vulnerable area accounts the 12% and 8% respectively. This approach provided very promising result and it was verified by field survey. The result provides the strong applicability of this approach to assess the vulnerability of coastal Bangladesh to tropical cyclones.",

Simple polynomial expressions fitting the neutral stability curves are given for a range of fault aspect ratios and fluid viscosity properties, providing a new tool for the estimation of critical Rayleigh numbers in faulted systems.

            "abstract": "The concept of index mineral based metamorphic zones was first introduced by George Barrow a little more than 100 years ago, and the Barrovian metamorphic zones are still today used as framework by metamorphic petrologists. Today the importance of metamorphic fluids for driving metamorphic reactions is widely recognised. Even so, a general view is that Barrovian metamorphism is solely controlled by pressure, temperature, and protolith composition. This study aims to establish if and how fluids control index mineral formation and distribution during Barrovian metamorphism. To do so, we use samples from Barrow’s own type locality in Glen Esk, Southeast Scottish Highlands, and study possible relationships between veining and index mineral distribution. In addition to petrographic and textural observations and analyses, we also use whole rock chemistry, mineral chemistry, and oxygen isotope analyses. At low grade, in the chlorite zone and most of the biotite zone, no correlation between veining and index mineral distribution is seen. At higher grade, the index mineral abundance is shown to decrease away from veins in the garnet and staurolite zones. Pseudosection analysis show larger garnet stability fields in vein-adjacent rock. In addition, quartz abundance and oxygen isotope ratios of quartz coincidentally decrease, which we interpret as evidence for fluid-rock interaction. The kyanite zone shows a fairly homogenous kyanite distribution, but also indications of extensive fluid-rock interaction, such as high vein density and oxygen isotope ratios in equilibrium with the fluid. Based on our observations and the geochemical datasets, we conclude that fluid played a major role in the stabilisation and distribution of the Barrovian index minerals in Glen Esk, and that the fluid control was larger at higher metamorphic grades.",

            "abstract": "This work aims to assess a diagnostic approach which links evapotranspiration (ET) to land surface temperature (LST) measured by thermal remote sensing in the Alps. We estimate gridded ET, from field (30 m) to regional (1 km) scales. A specific study is performed on water- and energy-limited grassland ecosystems in a dry inner alpine valley in South Tyrol (Italy), to evaluate the model sensitivity to soil moisture, topography and canopy structure variations. The energy balance model TSEB ALEXI (Two Source Energy Balance Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse) is first applied to Meteosat satellite data. Then ET is estimated by the flux disaggregation procedure DisALEXI driven by MODIS and Landsat LST retrievals. Finally, ET products based on MODIS and Landsat are fused by the algorithm STARFM (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model), to obtain daily maps at Landsat ground resolution (30 m). We validate the model by eddy-covariance (EC) measurements from established stations in the Alps. In addition, for studying the scale representativeness of the satellite retrieved ET, we exploit a thermal camera installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), addressing a similar spatial scale as EC measurements, which allows to study ET spatial patterns. Results show that in the Alps the fusion with MODIS-retrieved ET does not significantly improve retrievals based only on Landsat acquisitions. This is due to i) the low availability of clear-sky scenes and ii) the small scale (~10 m) changes in soil moisture, topography and canopy density, which control ET patterns in mountainous regions. Specific TSEB model runs driven by UAV-borne thermal sensor data confirm these results. In conclusion, current thermal satellites lack the temporal and spatial resolution required to characterize ET in the Alps. This limitation can be overcome only by developing new high resolution thermal-based remote sensing tools with a higher temporal frequency.",

The Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) aims to deliver insight into the geological structure of this fault zone and its evolution by drilling and sampling the Alpine Fault at depth. We have acquired and processed reflection seismic data to image the subsurface around the drill site. The resulting velocity models and seismic images of the upper 5 km show complex subsurface structures around the Alpine Fault zone. The most prominent feature is a strong reflector at depths of 1.2-2.2 km with a dip of ~40° to the southeast below the DFDP-2 borehole, which we assume to be the main trace of the Alpine Fault. The reflector exhibits varying lateral reflectivity along its extent. Additionally, subparallel reflectors are imaged that we interpret as secondary branches of the main fault zone. The derived P-wave velocity models reveal a 400-600 m thick sedimentary layer with velocities of ~2.3 km/s above a schist basement with velocities of 4.5-5.5 km/s. A pronounced low-velocity layer with velocities of approximately 3.5 km/s can be observed within the basement at 0.8-2 km depth. Small-scale low-velocity anomalies appear at the top of the basement and can be correlated to the fault zone. The results provide a reliable basis for a seismic site characterization at the DFDP-2 drill site that can be used for further structural and geological investigations of the architecture of the Alpine Fault in this area.",

It can be achieved through injections of aerosols, chemicals or radio (RF) signals into the ionosphere. The Metal Oxide Space Clouds (MOSC) experiment was undertaken in April/May 2013 to investigate chemical AIM. Two sounding rockets were launched from the Kwajalein Atoll (part of the Marshall Islands) and each released a cloud of vaporized samarium (Sm). The samarium created a localized plasma cloud, with increased electron density, which formed an additional ionospheric layer.\nThe ionospheric effects were measured by a wide range of ground based instrumentation which included a network of high frequency (HF) sounders. Chirp transmissions were made from three atolls and received at five sites within the Marshall Islands. One of the receive sites consisted of an 18 antenna phased array, which was used for direction finding. The ionograms have shown that as well as generating a new layer the clouds created anomalous RF propagation paths, which interact with both the cloud and the F-layer, resulting in ‘ghost traces’. To fully understand the propagation environment a 3D numerical ray trace has been undertaken, using a variety of background ionospheric and cloud models, to find the paths through the electron density grid for a given fan of elevation and azimuth firing angles. Synthetic ionograms were then produced using the ratio of ray path length to speed of light as an estimation of the delay between transmission and observation for a given frequency of radio wave.\nThis paper reports on the latest analysis of the MOSC propagation environment, comparing theory with observations, to further understanding of AIM.",

            "abstract": "Snow melting is an important process of the water cycle, especially over mountainous and plateau areas, where springtime runoff and streamflow of the downstream is mostly attributed to earlier snowmelt processes. Furthermore, snow water equivalent (SWE) responds to global climate change notably in these areas. The scarcity of in-situ measurements over the Tibetan Plateau hampers a better simulation of hydrological processes using a distributed hydrological model (Coupled Routing and Excess STorage model, CREST) that requires extensive data for forcing and calibrating the model. In this study, first, we assimilate MODIS land surface temperature into a temperature index snowmelt model to calculate snowmelt. Second, spatially distributed hydrological parameters (like degree-day factors, DDFs) for each grid cell are employed to represent the variations in topography and radiation effects for improving the performance of the temperature index snowmelt model. The study basin is the Yarlung Tsangpo–Brahmaputra River basin located in the south of the Tibetan Plateau with a catchment area of ~2.4×105 km2. The degree-day factors are calibrated by making the modeled snow cover area (SCA) toward the MODIS SCA. Other parameters to calculate the spatially distributed snow depth and snow density are estimated by comparison with a snow depth data set (a fusion of SSM/I and AMSR-E products). To achieve calibration of spatially distributed parameters, a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM) is used to simplify the number of the distributed hydrological parameters. The parameters are generally subdivided into different clusters according to the attributes in spatial similarity through this FCM algorithm. Consequently, parameter estimation and calibration can be more feasible and efficient. Results indicate that assimilation of remotely sensed SCA and snow depth improves the simulation of snowmelt and SWE for CREST, which can be more useful in explaining long-term variations in SWE over the study basin.",

In this study, performance of the convection and land surface schemes in simulating ISM are investigated using RegCM 4. The performance of two land surface schemes [BATS, CLM 3.5] and five convection schemes [MIT, Kuo, Grell, Grell over Land and MIT over Ocean (GL_MO), Grell over Ocean and MIT over Land (GO_ML)] are tested. The model at 30 km resolution covering (30˚E-120˚E, 15˚S-45˚N) is integrated for the period of 1st May-30thSeptember during 2007, 2008 and 2009. The initial and boundary conditions are derived from NNRP1 data at 2.5˚×2.5˚ resolution. The Sea Surface Temperature is taken from NOAA Optimum Interpolation weekly mean data at 1˚×1˚ resolution.\nSome important features of ISM simulated by the model; viz. Somaly jet, Tropical easterly jet (TEJ), Heat low, Tibetan high etc. are analyzed with NCEP reanalysis. Heat low is well produced by the model with MIT, GO_ML and GL_MO schemes. The Somaly jet is usually weak but better simulated with MIT scheme. Although the model is able to reproduce the TEJ and Subtropical westerly jet, the location and strength of the jets are varying scheme-wise and is better simulated by MIT scheme. The model is also able to simulate the stronger easterly jet in 2007 compared to 2009 with MIT scheme. The rainfall over Central and North West India is significantly under-predicted by the model with all these schemes. The monthly and seasonal precipitation is better simulated by the model with the combination of MIT convection scheme and CLM compared to the other combinations although it over-predicts rainfall over heavy precipitation zones. Considering overall performances, RegCM4 shows better skill in simulating ISM with MIT convection scheme using CLM.",

            "abstract": "JGrass-NewAge (Formetta et al., 2014) is a new hydrological system for forecasting and modeling of water and related resources. It is based on the object modeling framework version 3 (OMS3), on the JGrasstools, and the GIS toolkit Geotools. Differently from traditional models, it is built upon components, that can be connected at run-time, to provide a variety of modeling solutions. The components can be selected, adopted, and connected according to the modeler needs, without rewriting the whole model. Different hydrological components simulate different hydrological processes, or simply model tasks as human actions. Therefore the framework is well suited to estimate impacts of the climate crisis or of land-use changes. In order to expand the possibilities of JGrass-NewAge, in this work we developed some new components to integrate in the framework the theory of transport for travel times of Botter et al. (2011), and Benettin, P (2015), that we coupled with the existing ones (Formetta et al., 2011, 2013, 2014).Treatment of the hydrologic response for travel time is deemed important to allow subsequent treatment of natural tracers, temperature, nutrients or pollutants, at catchment level.In this contribution, however, we focused on the estimation of the outflows , at hourly time-step, and water age of river Adige, the second longest and largest in Italy, covering approximately 12 thousand square kilometers. The modeling solution presented is based on a small hydrologic response units, approximately coincident with the hillslope, and, for each of them, we solve the hydrological budget, including snowfall and melting, and runoff production, evapotranspiration. The hydrological budget of the river is therefore presented, and travel time distributions of water are also discussed.",

In particular it makes it possible to relate the rockfall dynamics recorded by the cameras with the time change of the seismic energy. The aim of this study is to better extract the information contained in the seismic signal by comparing the force generated by the rockfall and the work rate, potential and kinematic energy changes calculated using numerical models of rockfalls with the generated seismic power during the rockfall propagation down the slope of the Dolomieu crater. A detailed comparison of the simulated dynamics with the movies of several rockfalls makes it possible to identify the different phases of the flow (initial collapse, impacts and interaction with the topography, stopping phase) and to relate them to the observed seismic signal. Simulations of rockfalls on 2D and 3D topographies obtained by laser-scanner survey of the crater are performed using the thin layer depth-averaged code SHALTOP. In particular we test the effect of the friction law (constant friction and volume or velocity weakening friction) on the simulated force and work rate to investigate if the signature of the friction law may be identified on seismic records.",

            "abstract": "   Kuchinoerabu-jima, volcano is a volcanic island located southern Kyushu, Japan. In 3 August, 2014, a small eruption at active summit crater, Shin-dake, destroyed all the observation stations near the summit. Since then, this volcano was only poorly monitored. After the eruption, entering within 2km from Shin-dake crater was strictly prohibited and thus it was impossible to fix summit stations on site. In April, 2015, we conducted seismic sensor installation by using unmanned helicopter (RMAX-G1 manufactured by Yamaha) so as to reestablish the seismic monitoring network near the summit area. We installed four seismic stations in the summit area. We also conducted various types of near-summit observations including an aero-magnetic measurement over the summit area, taking visual and infra-red images from low altitude, and volcanic gas sampling. We present preliminary results of the near summit observations using unmanned helicopter.\nThe light-weight (5kg) and solar-powered seismic stations were designed exclusively for helicopter installation. They transmit seismic data every 10 minutes by using mobile data communication network. We could install them within 500m from the summit crater on 17, April. On 29 May, Shin-dake crater erupted again and the newly installed seismic stations were all destroyed by this eruption. The seismic stations could transmit data until just before the eruption. These data made us possible to evaluate the change in seismic activity leading up to the eruption.\n An aero-magnetic survey was conducted on 17 and 18 April. The flight altitude was between 100m and 150m above the ground (i.e a draped magnetic survey) . Path interval is 100m and the total flight path length is 80km. The magnetic intensity data were converted to magnetization of the edifice of Shin-dake. Comparison between the result this time with that obtained in 2001 shows demagnetization near the summit area.\nTemperature measurement over the summit area detected 368ºC　at the fissure on the western flank.\nChemical composition of the volcanic gas was measured. Maximum concentration of SO2 was 28ppm and the apparent equilibrium temperature estimated from the gas composition was 550 ºC. CO2/SO2 ratio did not change significantly but a large variation in SO2/H2S ratio was observed.",

            "abstract": "The origin of atmospheric dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) deposition is not very clear at present. Across China, the DON deposition was substantially larger than that of world and Europe, and we found significant positive correlation between contribution of DON and the deposition flux with pristine site data lying in outlier, possibly reflecting the acute air quality problems in China. For a case study in Northeast China, we revealed the deposited DON was mainly derived from intensive agricultural activities rather than the natural sources by analyzing the compiled dataset across China and correlating DON flux with NH4+–N and NO3-–N. Crop pollens and combustion of fossil fuels for heating probably contributed to summer and autumn DON flux respectively. Overall, in Northeast China, DON deposition could exert important roles in agro-ecosystem nutrient management and carbon sequestration of natural ecosystems; nationally, it was suggested to found rational network for monitoring DON deposition.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that Earth’s mantle has heterogeneous calcium isotopic compositions. But the reason why mantle has its heterogeneity remains uncertain. In general, δ44/40Ca values of mantle xenolith samples have a variation of >0.45‰. While ultramafic rocks, especially dunites, have higher δ44/40Ca values than volcanic rocks, and there is a positive correlation between δ44/40Ca and Ca/Mg. These phenomena imply that the heterogeneity of Ca isotopic compositions of mantle xenolith samples might result from different degrees of melt extraction, as indicated by large Ca isotopic fractionation between co-existing clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene.\nHowever, because ancient marine carbonate has its own unique calcium isotopic characteristics, recycling of even a small amount of ancient marine carbonates into the mantle could also cause the heterogeneity of Ca isotopes in Earth’s mantle. This could be the reason why oceanic island basalts (OIB) have lighter Ca isotopic compositions than the mantle xenolith. Thus, the lighter Ca isotopic compositions in the mantle source cannot only be ascribed to magmatic processes. Therefore, it is more important to know calcium isotopic characteristics during partial melting and oceanic crust contamination.\nMid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) are formed from the partial melts of the upper mantle and are rarely affected by crustal contamination. Different types of MORB, including D-MORB, N-MORB and E-MORB, have experienced different degrees of partial melting and contamination of enriched end-members. Here we report calcium isotopic characteristic of different types of MORB, we believe it will be very helpful to understand the behaviors of Ca isotopes during partial melting and it is possible to provide further information to discover the reason why calcium isotopic compositions is heterogeneous in Earth’s mantle.\nThis work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41373007, No. 41490632 and No. 91328204) and State Key Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry grants (SKLIG-JY-12-01, SKLIG-KF-12-01 and SKLIG-KF-12-02).",

            "abstract": "Streambed structures such as dunes, pool-riffles or bars enhance the exchange of stream water and solutes with the subsurface, the hyporheic zone. Prior studies have evaluated the factors which control hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical processes for steady state hydrological conditions using numerical models. However, the impact of natural discharge variability on water and solute exchange, creating hydraulically specific conditions for the reactions in the shallow streambed, has not been studied so far.\nIn our study, we set up a transient flow and reactive transport model to elucidate the impact of single stream discharge events on water exchange, solute transport and reactions within the hyporheic zone of an in-stream gravel bar. The discharge events were varied by their duration and the maximum stream discharge. Temporally variable hydraulic heads were assigned as hydraulic head boundary conditions at the top of the reactive groundwater model MIN3P. A steady ambient groundwater flow field was introduced by lateral upstream and downstream hydraulic head boundaries, generating in combination with the stream water level, losing, neutral, or gaining stream conditions. Stream water borne dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon and nitrate can infiltrate into the modelling domain across the top boundary and can react with each other by aerobic respiration and denitrification.\nOur results show that water and solute exchange through the hyporheic zone (only stream water that infiltrates into the subsurface and exfiltrates back to the stream) is highly dependent on the interplay between event characteristics and the ambient groundwater level. In scenarios where the stream discharge shifts the hydraulic system to strong and long-lasting losing conditions, hyporheic flow paths are longer and the extent of the hyporheic zone are deeper than under base flow conditions and small events where gaining conditions prevail. Consequently, stream discharge events may temporally lead to increased reactivity efficiency (the proportion of solute consumption of solute influx) of the hyporheic zone by approximately 2.0 and 3.6 times for aerobic respiration and denitrification, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Ceres exhibits geological features indicating significant resurfacing due to impact cratering, tectonic stress, relaxation, mass displacement, upwelling, doming and possible cryo-volcanic and/or cryo-glacial processes. Ceres’ surface is characterized by a smooth and rugged topography ranging from about -7.5km to 7.5km relative to a best-fit ellipsoidal shape with 482x482x446km. Ceres’ topography has a much greater range in elevation relative to its ellipsoidal dimensions (3.2%) than the Moon and Mars (1% and 0.9%) or Earth (0.3%) but is lower compared to Vesta (15%). Its topography is comparable to the icy satellite Iapetus (3.6%) but significantly higher than that of other icy satellites (<1.8%). The topography of Ceres indicates a rigid crust manifesting a range of processes at large and small scales in the course of its geological evolution. Impact craters of all sizes, central peaks and rings, and a variety of ejecta blankets, as well as lineaments, apparent depression infills and distinctive bright spots characterize Ceres’ surface. Impact craters range from pristine to highly degraded, comparable to that of various icy satellites, the Moon and Vesta, indicating an intensive cratering history over the age of the solar system as indicated by surface units with different crater densities. Some craters show upwelling dome-like structures on the floor. Bright spots with higher albedo than the surrounding terrain occur at different locations correlated with impact structures and tectonic crustal stress. These spots indicate material differences and possible time-variable effects related to cryo-processes either volcanic and/or glacial. Trough-like features and polygonal impact crater rims indicate crustal stress that compensates by tectonic processes. According to the relatively high topography to radius ratio, steep slopes, mass wasting, and flow processes are expected and observed.

            "abstract": "Recent two phreatic eruptions occurred at Japan’s Ontake volcano on September 27, 2014 and in late March 2007. In this presentation, we analyze and compare seismicity and earthquake characteristics before eruptions of 2007 and 2014 and investigate possible precursory information of the two eruptions. We detect earthquakes associated with Japan’s Ontake eruptions in 2007 and 2014 using the match-and-locate (M&L) method. 37 times more events than the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) catalog and 30 times more events than the JMA catalog are detected during eruptions of 2007 and 2014, respectively. The detected earthquakes are further classified into three different types based on their spectrum characteristics: long-period (LP) events, LP-associated events and volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes. Both LP and LP-associated events are observed in two eruptions. We suggest that the observed intense seismicity before the two eruptions indicates the rewaking of Ontake volcano and might be used to predict its impending eruption in long-term, the temporal persistence and spatial concentration of LP and LP-associated events may be used to predict the eventual eruption location of Ontake volcano, and the maximum magnitude of the LP events may be used as an indicator of its eruption magnitude.",

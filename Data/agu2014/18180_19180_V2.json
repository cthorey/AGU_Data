            "abstract": "The stable-isotope, aerosol and atmospheric gas records in ice cores provide exceptional archives of past climate. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, a new 1500 m, approximately 40,000 year old ice core will be recovered from South Pole during the current 2014-2015 austral summer season (to ~ 700 m) and next 2015-2016 austral summer season (~ 700 m to 1500 m) using the new U.S. Intermediate Depth Drill. The combination of low temperature, relatively high accumulation rate, and low impurity concentrations at South Pole will yield a detailed record of atmospheric trace gases. The South Pole ice core will also provide a record of the climate history of a unique area of the East Antarctic plateau that is partly influenced by weather systems that cross the West Antarctic ice sheet. The South Pole ice core site is at a flank site where the ice flows at approximately 10 m/yr. The ice core recovered originated as snow at progressively greater distances from the coring site. New ground-penetrating radar collected over the drill site location shows no anthropogenic influence over the past ~50 years or upper 15 m. In this submission, we describe the climate and glaciologic setting of the South Pole, and the details of the ultimate coring site.",

            "abstract": "The Balloon Array for Radiation belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) was designed to observe X-rays from precipitating electrons in the Earth's atmosphere. During the second campaign in January 2014 Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) events were detected in the BARREL payloads as they produced atmospheric x-rays, γ-rays, and directly injected protons observed by the scintillator on the BARREL payloads. A total of 6 payloads were up during the event beginning 7 January with an X-class flare at 1832 UT, spread across a wide range of L and MLT. Payload 2I was on open field lines for the entire event while 2T (2W) crossed from open (closed) to closed (open) field lines over the course of the three day event. Payloads 2K and 2L were moving from the inner magnetosphere (L ~ 4) to higher field lines (L>6) while 2X stayed within the inner magnetosphere (L<6) for the entire event. Throughout this time, there were multiple conjunctions with the Van Allen Probes and good agreement with when (UT) and where (L-values) the energetic protons were observed, both in situ and at the balloons. In this poster we consider the transport of the protons from the sun and through the magnetosphere and eventual precipitation observed by the BARREL balloons.",

Reduced formation transmissivity due to clay swelling is a concern in CO2-enhanced gas production. Clay minerals partly determine the physical (i.e. permeability, brittleness) and certain chemical properties (i.e. wetting ability, gas adsorption) of shales, and montmorillonites are of particular interest because they swell by the uptake of species in their interlayer. In this study, the hydration and expansion of a Na-saturated montmorillonite (Na-SWy-2) in high-pressure (90 bar) and moderate temperature (50 °C) methane and mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide were investigated using in situ IR spectroscopic titrations and in situ XRD. The goals were to (1) determine if the hydration/expansion behavior of the clay in supercritical methane is different than in supercritical CO2, (2) determine if methane intercalates the clay, and (3) probe the effects of increasing CO2 concentrations. IR spectra were collected as Na-SWy-2 was titrated with water under several fluid exposures: pure methane, 25, 50, and 75 mole% CO2 in methane, and pure CO2. Complementary in situ XRD experiments were conducted in the same fluids at discrete dissolved water concentrations to measure the d001 values of the clay and thus its volume change on hydration and CH4 and/or CO2 intercalation. In pure methane, no direct evidence of CH4 intercalation was detected in CH bending or stretching regions of the IR spectra. Similarly, in situ XRD indicated the montmorillonite structure was stable in the presence of CH4 and no measurable changes to the basal spacing were observed. However, under low water conditions where the montmorillonite structure was partially expanded (~sub 1W), the IR data indicated a rapid intercalation of CO2 into the interlayer, even with fluid mixtures containing the lowest concentrations of CO2. Likewise, in situ XRD showed indirect evidence of CO2 intercalation from an increase in the basal spacing from 11.8 to 12.3 Å under identical conditions. These findings demonstrate that water and CO2 intercalation processes could lead to permeability changes that directly impact methane transmissivity in shales.",

            "abstract": "Catchment hydrogeochemists have long been puzzled by the ‘chemostatic’ behavior of rivers: solute concentrations remain nearly invariant while discharge fluctuates several orders of magnitude. Past studies have tended to focus on stream chemistry measurements. Little attention has been paid to source waters (i.e. groundwater). In this study, we simultaneously monitored water chemistry of stream and groundwater at 1-3 days intervals for four years in the Elder Creek catchment, the Eel Critical Zone Observatory, California. At our study site, all runoff occurs as groundwater flow. During the winter high-flow regime, cation (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Ba and Sr) concentrations in stream and groundwater were remarkably similar throughout the study period and were 5-100 times higher than that of throughfall. In contrast, during the low-flow regime, the cation concentrations in groundwater were higher than that in stream, and concentration differences varied by element. We propose that during the high-flow regime, rainwater rapidly increases solute concentrations by cation exchange reactions enhanced by pCO2 in the vadose zone, recharging groundwater and draining into the stream. During the dry season, groundwater reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with the argillite, particularly with carbonates, at high pCO2. As this groundwater enters the stream, CO2 degasses and consequently carbonates precipitate, decreasing Ca, Mg, Sr and Ba concentrations at the hillslope-stream interface. These cation concentrations are further decreased as carbonates likely mediated by biology-induced processes. These observations suggest that the apparent chemostatic behavior of Elder Creek does not arise from the failure of high flows to progressively dilute, as concentration in the creek and in the source groundwater are quite similar. Rather at progressively lower flow, stream concentration does not increase to match the low flow concentration in the groundwater. Instead as groundwater emerges, degassing and precipitation causes concentrations to drop and depress concentration increase with decreasing flow in the creek. This process can only be assessed by direct measurement of source groundwater: even emergent spring water will have already degassed and loss solutes to precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical data from the Galileo and Cassini-Huygens missions are consistent with the presence of aqueous subsurface oceans in several icy satellites of the solar system. The generic structural model of ocean-harboring icy moons has stood for decades: in the H2O unary system, the density contrasts between the liquid and the ice polymorphs imply that an aqueous ocean will sink relatively to an ice Ih surface layer but will be buoyant against high-pressure ices. However, high-pressure experiments in water-salt systems of interest to outer solar system bodies (e.g. the H2O-MgSO4 and H2O-NaCl systems) illustrated different density contrasts between brines and ices, thus questioning this structural paradigm [1,2]. To determine whether an ocean may be stable below a specific ice layer, composition-density data alone are not sufficient and must be coupled to solubility constraints. At any brine-ice boundary, the density of the liquid may only exceed that of the ice phase if its contaminants are soluble enough, i.e. if the eutectic composition of the water-salt system at the specific P-T conditions of the boundary allows the critical density to be achieved [3]. However, the exploration of liquid-ice equilibria in water-salts systems of interest is still incomplete between 0 and 1 GPa, the pressure range expected in the hydrospheres of Ganymede and Titan. To address this problem, we developped a quantitative Raman spectroscopy approach to explore the liquid-ice equilibria in the H2O-MgSO4 system. The acquired dataset complete previous works in this binary system in the 0 – 1 GPa range by (a) extending the exploration of the ice VI solidus and (b) giving reliable PTx datapoints on the liquidii of ices at low (~7 wt. %) and high (~15 wt. %) aqueous MgSO4 concentrations. With available data constraining the density of these solutions, these new results now make possible a reliable description of the H2O-MgSO4 system to be established up to 1 GPa. This background will be used to illustrate that the formation of deep high-pressure oceans may be a necessary consequence of the cooling of large differentiated icy moons such as Ganymede and Titan.\n[1] Vance and Brown, 2013, GCA 110, 176-189.

It includes contributions not only from global eruptive volcanoes but also 8 near-equator degassing volcanoes. Emissions from Nyamuragira in November 2006 November and Grimsvotn in May 2011 that were missed in the IPCC-5 inventory are now included. Overall, in comparison with our new inventory, well-used AEROCOM eruptive volcanic emission has high biases by a factor of 4. With updated volcanic emission inventory, the volcanic sulfate distribution was simulated from global transport model GEOS-Chem, which shows consistent temporal evolution of zonally averaged sulfate AOD with the CALIOP AOD above 10 Km, and the modeled AOD capture every eruption volcano sulfate with similar magnitude as CALIOP counterpart. The 8 years average contribution from eruptive SO42- to total SO42- loading is ~10% over the most area, and is only significant for those eruptions above 10 km, with the maximum ratio of 30% along tropical area. Tropical degassing volcano SO42- barely reaches above 10 km, but is regionally dominate type of aerosols (60%+ in terms of mass in lower atmosphere) over Hawaii, and ocean area at northeast to Australia. The 8 years averaged global eruption volcano sulfate forcing (-0.09 Wm-2) is found to be slightly higher than reported by IPCC, and the tropical degassing sulfate forcing is estimated as -0.02 Wm-2. The global and monthly mean sulfate forcing efficiency to SO2 emission was calculated for 3 categories. For eruptive volcanoes sulfate the forcing efficiency is more than 5 times of the counterpart of the background (mostly anthropogenic) sulfate, and for the 8 tropical degassing volcanoes sulfate it is slight higher than the one for background sulfate. That indicates the injection height is an important factor to decide the volcano sulfate forcing efficiency. The updated volcanic database is available upon request.",

            "abstract": "Spectroscopy is an extremely powerful tool for diagnosing astrophysical and other plasmas. For example, the shapes of line profiles provide valuable information on the distribution of velocities along an optically thin line-of-sight and across the finite area of a resolution element. A number of recent studies have measured the asymmetries of line profiles in order to detect faint high-speed upflows, perhaps associated with coronal nanoflares or perhaps associated with chromospheric nanoflares and type II spicules. Over most of the Sun, these asymmetries are very subtle, so great care must be taken. A common technique is to perform a spline fit of the points in the profile in order to extract information at a spectral resolution higher than that of the original data. However, a fundamental problem is that the fits do not conserve intensity. We have therefore developed an iterative procedure called Intensity Conserving Spline Interpolation that does preserve the observed intensity within each wavelength bin. It improves the measurement of line asymmetries and can also help with the determination of line blends.",

            "abstract": "In-situ bioremediation is a widely applied treatment technology for source zones contaminated with dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). It is both economical and reasonably efficient for long-term management and closure of contaminated sites. A number of laboratory studies have demonstrated enhancement in chlorinated ethene dissolution rates due to the presence of dehalogenating microorganisms, which may lead to increased mass removal rates and shorter cleanup times. Previous modeling efforts have suggested this dissolution enhancement can be a factor of 10 or more when the contaminant is located in high saturation DNAPL pools. Yet, laboratory studies with DNAPL trapped as ganglia have suggested dissolution enhancement is often less than 10. This presentation investigates the interplay between dissolution and degradation rates in ganglia-contaminated source zones using a one-dimensional, simplified, steady-state, analytical solution to the advection-dispersion-reaction equation. A linear driving force model is employed to simulate ganglia dissolution. Degradation kinetics are approximated as zero- or first-order. Model predictions are independently compared to laboratory data available in the literature. Results indicate that dissolution enhancement predictions in ganglia-dominated source zones are often much less than those predicted assuming high saturation pools, suggesting that the presented model is a better tool for estimating bioenhanced dissolution in ganglia-contaminated regions. Furthermore, this screening model provides a remarkably good prediction of laboratory results and could provide practitioners with a useful tool for estimating the extent to which bioenhanced dissolution may aid in site closure strategies.",

            "abstract": "The long-term and large scale dynamics of ecosystems are in large part determined by the performances of individual plants in competition with one another for light, water and nutrients. Woody biomass, a pool of carbon (C) larger than that in the atmosphere, exists because of height-structured competition for light. However, none of the current Earth System Models that predict climate change and C cycle feedbacks includes a mechanistic formulation for height-structured competition for light, or an explicit scaling from individual plants to the globe. In this study, we incorporate height-structured competition and explicit scaling from individuals to ecosystems into the land model (LM3) currently used in the Earth System Models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory based on the Perfect Plasticity Approximation model (PPA), which has been shown to scale accurately from individual plants to stands in individual-based simulation models of plant competition for light, water and nutrients. Because of the tractability of the PPA, the coupled LM3-PPA model is able to include a large number of phenomena across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and still retain computational and mathematical tractability. We test a range of predictions against data from the temperate forests in northern USA. The results show the model predictions agree with diurnal and annual C fluxes, growth rates of individual trees in the canopy and understory, tree size distributions, and species-level population dynamics during succession. We also show how the competitively optimal allocation strategy shifts at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to competition with alternative strategies in the model. The results show that the competitively optimal allocation of carbon to leaves, wood, and fine roots depends on the atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that C sinks caused by CO2 fertilization in forests limited by light and water are down-regulated if allocation tracks changes in the competitive optimum, indicating the critical roles of competition played in predicting forest ecosystems responses to climate change.",

Over the past decade, miniaturized microfluidic flowcell prototypes of subsurface reservoir systems, usually called micromodels and named GeoBioCells herein, have been used to replace traditional column experiments. However, the inert pore structure in these micromodels does not contain the biogeochemical grain surface heterogeneities in actual subsurface rock reservoirs. In this study, we developed a next-generation microfluidic experimental test bed, herein called the Reservoir Rock GeoBioCell (RRGBC), in which an actual piece of subsurface reservoir rock is mounted within a microfluidic flowcell for experimentation.\nSiliciclastic sandstones core samples of an oil-bearing subsurface reservoir were obtained for construction of the RRGBC. Custom petrographic rock sections (0.5 mm thick) were prepared from these core samples impregnated with Super Glue adhesive. Acetone was then used to remove the Super Glue and physically separate thin sections from the glass slides. A PDMS mold (~3-4 mm thick) was prepared to hold the thin section between a microfluidic inlet and outlet channels. The thin section in PDMS mold was covered with a PDMS-coated glass coverslip to help provide a pressure seal for core thin section (Figure 1, left-top).\nMulti-photon laser confocal microscopy of the RRGBC showed pore connectivity to an imaging depth of ~400 µm within the thin section. The geochemical reactive sites were characterized using Raman Backscattering Microscopy, confirming the presence of reactive quartz. A fluorescent tracer test was conducted to identify micro-flow paths and solute breakthrough within the thin section (Figure 1). A multiphase flow experiment was performed to trap residual light oil in the thin section. A mixed-culture of oil-degrading biofilm was developed to degrade the entrapped oil, and an oxygen sensitive fluorophore was used to observe regions of microbial activity. The RRGBC developed in this study is useful for quantitatively testing and monitoring the physical, chemical and biological factors that affect subsurface carbonate diagenesis and other biogeochemical reactions.",

            "abstract": "Climate change poses grave risks for societies and people all around the earth. Though details of the risks remain uncertain, they include accelerating sea level rise and ocean acidification, regional drought, floods and heat waves, crop failures and more: dangerous changes are already occurring, while GHG emissions continue to grow, ice melts, water expands, temperature rises, and weather patterns shift.\nOur roles as individuals and nations in producing the emissions of GHGs responsible for this episode of climate change, and the actions that could be taken to mitigate it, raise difficult ethical questions. When we are responsible for putting others in danger, we have a duty to mitigate that danger. But our sense of responsibility is diluted here: each individual act contributes only minutely to the overall risks, and the links between individual acts and the harms they produce are complex, indirect and involve many other agents. In these circumstances, our sense of personal responsibility is diminished and uncoordinated, individual responses to the risks become ineffective.\nWe propose a view of the ethics of climate change that begins with the tragedy of the commons: Free use of a shared, indispensable resource can lead to catastrophe as the resource is overrun, and the destruction of the commons arises from choices that are individuallyrational, if each person’s choice is made independently of others’. Finally, individuals often fail to make ethical choices when the links between individual actions and their negative outcomes are obscure, when individual choices are made separately and privately, and when special interests stand to gain from actions that are generally harmful.\nPhilosophical work in ethics has emphasized the role of ethics in enabling cooperation between individuals and coordinating group responses to problems, while recent work on social rules has modeled them as generalized forbiddings, taught and enforced by ‘blocking’ behaviours which discourage forbidden action-types. We argue that a successful response to climate change will depend on adopting ethically grounded rules (laws and treaties) that acknowledge collective responsibility and take a clear stand against special interests: Margaret Thatcher notwithstanding, there is such a thing as society—or so we must hope.",

Airborne bathymetric lidar data, collected two days before Sandy made landfall, are used as a pre-storm baseline. Morphologic changes are measured using field surveyed GPS profiles collected along a limited portion of western Fire Island two months following Sandy and along the length of the island one year after Sandy. The offshore extent of the data is variable and analyses are constrained by the resolving ability of the lidar sensor, which typically achieved penetration to depths of 6-8m.\nThe surfzone morphology was extensively impacted by Hurricane Sandy and continued to evolve during subsequent winter storms. As is typical during large storm events, the outer bar moved offshore during Sandy. A year after the storm, however, the bar remains further offshore than it was prior to Sandy, resulting in a widened surfzone. Both the subaerial and submarine portions of the beach system lost considerable volumes of sand. The majority of the loss below mean high water (MHW) is in the surfzone, concentrated in the trough immediately landward of the outer bar and generally in the pre-storm location of the outer bar. The trough not only deepened in response to Sandy, but in many locations continued to deepen over the course of the following year, with an average change of more than a meter. The average volume of the shoreface seaward of the bar increased, which is attributed to the seaward translation of the outer bar and additional offshore transport and deposition of material from the inner surfzone during the storm. Additional surveys will be used to examine whether Sandy resulted in a longer-term reconfiguration of the shoreface or if the morphologic changes are largely ephemeral and the system recovers to a pre-Sandy morphologic state.",

            "abstract": "The period between 50-30 kya in western Eurasia witnessed Neanderthal extinction, anatomically modern human (AMH) expansion, and a transition from Middle to Upper Paleolithic material culture. The prevailing hypothesis suggests a replacement of the Neanderthal populations by incoming AMH population, perhaps involving climatic fluctuations that favored AMH biology and habitat preferences. Yet, new evidence questions the role of climate as a forcing factor in AMH dispersal from Africa, raising the possibility that AMH populations in southern Arabia were responsible for the <50 ka expansion into western Eurasia.\nNew excavations at Mughr el-Hamamah (MHM), Ajlun District, Jordan, uncovered a single well preserved occupational horizon. This horizon is dated by acid-base-wet oxidation/stepped combustion (ABOX-SC) AMS 14C assays to 45-39,000 cal BP and is associated with abundant diagnostic Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) artifacts. The age of the site, combined with its excellent organic preservation, suggests that MHM can play a key role in testing hypotheses about the southern Levantine Rift Valley environment and EUP human adaptations to it.\nThis paper presents a paleoecological reconstruction derived from micromammal remains associated with in situ archaeological deposits in MHM. The assemblage is highly dominated by the Syrian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), typical of cool and humid climate. It is common in Late Glacial fauna of the Mediterranean of the Levant, in sites such as Kebara UP and Amud. Yet, today it is known only from high elevation in Turkey, Syria and Jordan. Other taxa include several genera of murids, further supporting the reconstruction of woodland habitats within a 1-3 km radius around the site. Additional archaeological data confirm that MHM was situated along an ecotone between the forested, temperate plateau and the Jordan Valley bottom grassland. Dead Sea speleothems and stromatolites in Dead Sea escarpment caves, indicating a high stand of Lake Lisan ca. 40 ka, and suggesting an increase in humidity, are consisted with these results.\nThe ameliorate climate may have been a contributing factor for AMH dispersal into and out of the region. Thus, this Levantine rich ecozone would have \"funneled\" longer-distance mobility toward the Taurus-Zagros flanks, Mesopotamia and perhaps beyond.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) are important contributors to rainfall in the High Plains of the United States. It is therefore of interest to understand how different vertical distributions and concentrations of aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) may impact the amount, intensity, and spatial distribution of precipitation produced by MCSs. Unlike ordinary cumulonimbi, MCSs are organized convection systems composed of convective upright updrafts and downdrafts, as well as slowly ascending and descending slantwise motions. These motions can supply moisture to the stratiform-anvil of the MCS without passing through the convective cores. Moreover, the slantwise ascending motions originate some 3-5km above ground level thereby consisting of air with different properties than upright convective updrafts. In order to study the impact of enhanced potential CCN concentrations on MCS precipitation, it is important to understand aerosol microphysical impacts on the dynamics of the different modes of convection within the MCS.\nIn this study, different aerosol concentrations and their effects on the dynamics of the different modes of MCS convection are examined by simulating a case study using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). Four simulations were conducted, where each simulation differed in the initial aerosol concentrations as well as their vertical distributions. Previous studies have shown that enhanced aerosols invigorate upright convective updrafts, however, the microphysical effects of increased aerosols and their impact on the dynamics of the slow ascending slantwise motion within an MCS, as of yet, have not been studied. In this presentation, the effects of aerosols on the upright convection, slantwise convection and the resulting impacts on precipitation will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ENSO variability is manifest in the western Pacific through heat and moisture exchanges associated with the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). Forward modeling (pseudoproxy analysis) results and published coral proxy records from the tropical Pacific indicate that in addition to the central and eastern Pacific regions, corals from the WPWP and SPCZ regions skillfully record ENSO variability. Some studies suggest that precessional forcing directly reduces/enhances ENSO variability. Other studies suggest that internal variability is the primary control on Holocene ENSO changes. Herein, we use coral proxy records from the tropical Pacific and numerical simulations to better understand the response of ENSO to precessional forcing and internal variability.\nWe extend the coral record of ENSO variability using a new modern coral record from the Solomon Islands (1716-2008 CE) and a select suite of Holocene fossil coral records from the WPWP. The new modern coral record captures large ENSO events with considerable skill, providing new evidence for potential large ENSO events during the early 18th and 19th centuries, events that are not represented in current coral and/or multi-proxy reconstructions. We also note that long periods of reduced ENSO activity can occur during intervals with near constant precessional forcing at modern values. The fossil coral records provide discrete time windows into ENSO variability over the Holocene. These records provide evidence of similar patterns of ENSO activity during intervals with different precessional configurations. The modern and fossil coral records imply a strong influence of internal variability in the modulation of ENSO, which may make it difficult to establish a direct control of precessional forcing on ENSO variability over the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "We present the latest 3-D isotropic crustal velocity model beneath central Idaho and eastern Oregon. We produced the velocity model from vertical component Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity measurements on data from the IDaho/ORegon (IDOR) Passive seismic network, 86 broadband seismic stations, using ambient noise tomography and the methods of Gallego et. al (2010) and Lin et. al (2008). We calculated inter-station group/phase velocities in narrow frequency bands from travel-time measurements of the stacked cross-correlations (bandpass filtered between 2 and 30 seconds), which we used to invert for velocity structure beneath the network. Goals of our work include refining models of crustal structure in the accreted Blue Mountain terranes in the western study area; determining the depth extent of the Salmon River Suture/West Idaho Shear Zone (WISZ), which crosses north-south through the middle of the network; determining the architecture of the Idaho batholith, an extensive largely crustal-derived pluton; and examining the nature of the autochthonous (?) North American crust and lithosphere beneath and east of the batholith.\nWe derived Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity maps for each frequency band using the damped least-squares inversion method of Tarantola (2005), and then jointly inverted for velocity with depth. Moho depths are prescribed in the joint inversions based on receiver functions, also from the IDOR seismic data, and provides a starting crustal velocity model. 3-D checkerboard resolution tests indicate lateral resolution of better than 40 km.\nPreliminary results show higher S wave velocities in the western study area, and lower velocities in the lower crust on the east side of the network, consistent with Basin-and-Range style extension there. A tabular velocity anomaly juxtaposing higher above lower seismic velocities dips shallow west in the midcrust on the west side of the network.",

The study allows a picture of unusual flow processes in submarine channels. The studied channels can be divided into two discrete segments:\n(1) Upper segments are characterized by low aspect ratio(W/T), little lateral offset (Lm), and low migration/aggradation ratios (Lm/Va). These upper segment channels build vertically-stacked channel-complex sets (CCSs), each of which is characterized by a facies transition from fine-grained sands in the lower part overlain by debris flow deposits and then shale drapes. Energetic sediment density flows triggered by fluid escape and/or strong wave action were well able to bypass sediment and to mask relatively weak bottom currents, yielding deep-water channels characterized by little lateral offset and dominantly aggradational stacking patterns.\n(2) Lower segments are characterized by higher W/T, wide lateral offset (Lm), and high Lm/Va. They consist of laterally-migrated CCSs, each of which consists of fine-grained reworked sands in the lower part overlain by debris flow deposits and, finally, shale drapes. Bottom currents restricted within the channels would have induced a tilt of the interface between turbidity currents and the overriding bottom currents (Wedderburn number > 1). This would have deflected turbidity currents downward and back toward the gentle channel bank, thus causing channel migration (the steep bank) by ~2° to 15°, and yielding a helical flow circulation composed of a high-velocity zone along the steep bank and a low-velocity zone along the gentle bank. This bottom current-induced helical flow circulation promoted deposition on the gentle bank, but it favored erosion on the steep banke, yielding deep-water channels exhibiting wide lateral offset and dominantly laterally-offset stacking patterns.\nSediment supplied to the studied channels was therefore sorted, winnowed and swept along the steep bank by the high-velocity zone along this bank, yielding bottom current-reworked sands that that are preferentially disturbed along the steep bank of the studied channels.",

            "abstract": "Present knowledge of the chain of dominantly andesitic volcanoes, which span the Sumatran portion of the Sunda Arc is extremely limited. Previous studies have focused on Toba and Krakatau, although over 13 further volcanic edifices are known. Several recent explosive eruptions in Sumatra such as that of Mt. Sinabung, 2014, have highlighted the potential hazard that these volcanoes pose to the local and regional communities. Mount Kerinci, is one of the most active of the volcanoes in this region, yet little is known about the petrogenesis of the magma by which it is fed. Kerinci is located approximately mid-way between Toba in the North and Krakatau in the south.\nAlong arc variations are observed in the major, minor and trace elements of whole rock analyses. However, bulk rock approaches produce an average chemical composition for a sample, potentially masking important chemical signatures. In-situ micro-analytical analysis of individual components of samples such as melt inclusions, crystals and groundmass provides chemical signatures of individual components allowing the evolution of volcanic centres to be deciphered in considerably more detail. Examination of whole rock chemistry indicates its location may be key to unravelling the petrogenesis of the arc as significant chemical changes occur between Kerinci and Kaba, 250 km to the south.\nKerinci samples are dominantly porphyritic with large crystals of plagioclase, pyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides, rare olivine crystals are observed. Plagioclase and pyroxene crystals are chemically zoned and host melt inclusions. Multiple plagioclase populations are observed. A combination of in-situ micro-analysis techniques will be used to characterise the chemical composition of melt inclusions and crystals. These data can be used along with extant geothermobarometric models to help determine the magma source, storage conditions and composition of the evolving melt. Integration of the findings from this study with existing data for the volcanic chain will enable along-arc variations in magmatic processes in Sumatra to be assessed more thoroughly, providing fundamental insights into the evolution of not only Kerinci, but magma genesis in Sumatra in general.\nKeywords: Sunda Arc, andesite, arc volcanism, petrogenesis.",

            "abstract": "To address long-standing questions on relationships between tectonic, magmatic, and geochemical segmentation of ocean ridges, we synthesized geological, geophysical and geochemical data in well-studied axial regions at a range of spreading rates. At fast and slow spreading ridges, changes in ridge properties such as axial depth, gravity anomalies, crustal thickness, and lava composition approaching or across transform faults are often comparable to those at smaller offsets. This argues against hierarchical models where transform fault-bounded segmentation arises from deeper processes than small-scale segmentation. At both fast and slow spreading rates, geophysical observations support the concept of relatively regularly spaced “principle magmatic segments,” on average 30-50 km long and fed by melt accumulations in the shallow asthenosphere. Evidence includes thicker crust at segment centers than ends along slow spreading ridges, and seismic imaging of segmented melt accumulations in the upper mantle at fast spreading ridges (Toomey et al., 2007). In the classification of Macdonald et al. (1988), principle magmatic segments correspond with 2nd order segments on slow spreading ridges and 3rd order segments on fast spreading ridges. The principle magmatic segment concept bears similarities to the spreading cell concept of Schouten et al. (1985) but it is linked to a distinct melt plumbing system in the aesthenosphere (>6 to >12 km dbs). While principle magmatic segments are well defined by geophysical observations in a number of regions, their relationship with chemical segmentation is more complex. At fast spreading rates, changes in source composition or melting parameters can coincide with offsets of all orders, and along one of the few well-studied slow-spreading ridges the great diversity of melt compositions over short spatial scales (Gale et al., 2011) must be reconciled with geophysical evidence suggesting significant focusing of melt toward segment centers.",

            "abstract": "Scientific literacy and inquiry-based writing go together like a hand and glove. Science literacy, defined by NRC in The NSF Standards, stresses the relationship between knowledge of science and skill in literacy so “a person can ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences. It means that a person has the ability to describe, explain, and predict natural phenomena. Scientific literacy entails being able to read with understanding articles about science in the popular press and to engage in social conversation about the validity of the conclusions. Scientific literacy implies that a person can identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed.” A growing body of research and practice in science instruction suggests language is essential in the practice of the geosciences.\nWriting and critical thinking are iterative processes. We use this approach to educate our geoscience students to learn, write, and think critically. One does not become an accomplished writer via one course. Proficiency is gained through continued exposure, guidance and tailored assignments.\nInquiry-based geoscience makes students proficient in the tools of the geosciences and to develop explanations to questions about Earth events. We have scaffolded our courses from introductory geology, English composition, writing in the geosciences, introduction to field methods and report writing to do more critical thinking, research data gatherings, and in-depth analysis and synthesis. These learning experiences that encourage students to compare their reasoning models, communicate verbally, written and graphically. The English composition course sets the stage for creative assignments through formulation of original research questions, collection of primary data, analysis, and construction of written research papers. Proper use of language allows students to clarify their ideas, make claims, present arguments, and record and present findings. Students have acquired the skills to be considered scientifically literate and capable of learning. A poster demonstrating the tie between Scientific Literacy and Inquiry-Based Writing has been produced and distributed widely around campus.",

            "abstract": "Rock particles in debris flows are reduced in size through abrasion and fracture. Wear of coarse sediments results in production of finer particles, which alter the bulk material rheology and influence flow dynamics and runout distance. Particle wear also affects the size distribution of coarse particles, transforming the initial sediment size distribution produced on hillslopes into that delivered to the fluvial channel network. A better understanding of the controls on particle wear in debris flows would aid in the inferring flow conditions from debris flow deposits, in estimating the initial size of sediments entrained in the flow, and in modeling debris flow dynamics and mapping hazards. The rate of particle size reduction with distance traveled should depend on the intensity of particle interactions with other particles and the flow boundary, and on rock resistance to wear. We seek a geomorphic transport law to predict rate of particle wear with debris flow travel distance as a function of particle size distribution, flow depth, channel slope, fluid composition and rock strength. Here we use four rotating drums to create laboratory debris flows across a range of scales. Drum diameters range from 0.2 to 4.0 m, with the largest drum able to accommodate up to 2 Mg of material, including boulders. Each drum has vanes along the boundary to prevent sliding. Initial experiments use angular clasts of durable granodiorite; later experiments will use less resistant rock types. Shear rate is varied by changing drum rotational velocity. We begin experiments with well-sorted coarse particle size distributions, which are allowed to evolve through particle wear. The fluid is initially clear water, which rapidly acquires fine-grained wear products. After each travel increment all coarse particles (mass > 0.4 g) are weighed individually. We quantify particle wear rates using statistics of size and mass distributions, and by fitting various comminution functions to the data. Laboratory data are compared with longitudinal evolution of grain size and angularity of particles deposited by debris flows along Inyo Creek, Sierra Nevada, California. Preliminary results suggest wear rates can be scaled across drum sizes and to field conditions using non-dimensional metrics of flow dynamics including Savage, Bagnold, and Froude numbers.",

Communities – and the water resource managers that serve them – are facing difficult choices to increase emergency preparedness, recover from costly impacts, and increase long term resilience. The presentation is based on a recent set of case studies about what happened in six communities that experienced one or more extreme events, focusing on water resource management. Two of the case studies will be presented, revealing that building climate resilience is not just about long term planning – it is also about taking the steps to be prepared for – and to be able to recover from – emergency events.

            "abstract": "The use of reflective surfaces offers one low-cost solution for reducing solar loading to urban environments and the Earth that should be considered as part of sustainable urban design. Here, we characterize the radiative benefits, i.e. the additional shortwave radiation leaving the atmosphere, from the installation of highly reflective “cool” roofs in urban areas in India that face relatively large local aerosol burdens. We use a previously tested column radiative transfer model to estimate the energy per unit area reflected to space from increasing the surface albedo at six cities within India. The model is used to characterize radiative transfer each day over five years (2008-2012) based on mid-day satellite retrievals of MODIS aerosol depth, cloud water path, and average surface albedo and MERRA atmospheric profiles of temperature and composition. Compared against 10 months of field observations in two cities, the model derived incoming surface shortwave radiation estimates relative to observations show small biases (0.5% and -2.6%, at Pantnagar and Nainital, respectively). Despite the high levels of local aerosols we found cool roofs provided significant radiative benefits at all locations. Averaged over the five year period we found that increasing the albedo of 1 m-2 of roof area by 0.5 would reflect to space 0.9 - 1.2 kWh daily from 08:30 – 15:30 LST, depending on location. This is equivalent to a constant forcing of 37 - 50 W m-2 (equivalent to reducing CO2 emissions by 74 to 101 kg CO2 m-2 roof area). Last, we identify a co-benefit of improving air quality, in that removing aerosols from the atmosphere could increase the radiative benefits from cool roofs by 23 – 74%, with the largest potential increase found at Delhi and the smallest change found at Nainital.",

            "abstract": "Is a small quantity of high-precision ages more robust than a higher quantity of lower-precision ages for sediment core chronologies? AMS Radiocarbon ages have been available to researchers for several decades now, and precision of the technique has continued to improve. Analysis and time cost is high, though, and projects are often limited in terms of the number of dates that can be used to develop a chronology. The Gas Ion Source at the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS), while providing lower-precision (uncertainty of order 100 14C y for a sample), is significantly less expensive and far less time consuming than conventional age dating and offers the unique opportunity for large amounts of ages. Here we couple two approaches, one analytical and one statistical, to investigate the utility of an age model comprised of these lower-precision ages for paleotempestology. We use a gas ion source interfaced to a gas-bench type device to generate radiocarbon dates approximately every 5 minutes while determining the order of sample analysis using the published Bayesian accumulation histories for deposits (Bacon). During two day-long sessions, several dates were obtained from carbonate shells in living position in a sediment core comprised of sapropel gel from Mangrove Lake, Bermuda. Samples were prepared where large shells were available, and the order of analysis was determined by the depth with the highest uncertainty according to Bacon. We present the results of these analyses as well as a prognosis for a future where such age models can be constructed from many dates that are quickly obtained relative to conventional radiocarbon dates. This technique currently is limited to carbonates, but development of a system for organic material dating is underway. We will demonstrate the extent to which sacrificing some analytical precision in favor of more dates improves age models.",

            "abstract": "Among natural fractures observed in core of Eagle Ford Shale, Texas, tall sub-vertical calcite-cemented fractures are the most spatially extensive. Similar sub-vertical opening-mode fractures are found in many mudrocks, and far more often than not they are completely cemented. Currently there is very little evidence that these calcite cements are anything but impermeable, and thus would hinder flow across the fractures while having an insignificant effect on flow parallel to the fractures. This suggests that natural fractures in mudrocks are barriers to flow, which goes against the general consensus that natural fractures in mudrocks enhance flow. We used scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) on broad-beam argon-ion milled samples of a calcite-cemented fracture with a kinematic aperture (width) of 200 µm to study the pore space of the calcite for any indication that completely cemented fractures are permeable. In the fracture calcite cement, we observed primary porosity between calcite grains that is generally well-connected with an average aperture between 25 and 100 nm. The permeability of these flow-paths was determined by lattice Boltzmann methods to be between 50 to 200 µD. These flow-paths have a spacing between 50 and 300 µm, therefore a square centimeter (length*height) of fracture cement will contain on average more than 100 flow-paths. Thus for flow across the fracture cement (orthogonal to the fracture) the overall cross-fracture permeability of the cement can be approximated using simple effective medium upscaling. The fracture cement studied here is found to have a cross-fracture permeability in the range of 25 to 100 nD. Although this is a very low permeability, it is within the range of the permeability of the host rock, and thus these calcite cements would have almost no effect on flow orthogonal to the plane of the fracture. These flow-paths are also connected within the cement creating the equivalent of a single tortuous flow-path along the plane of the fracture with a possible permeability upwards of 10 to 50 µD. This is far lower than the permeability of the fracture without the cement (~1500 D), but in comparison to the host rock permeability (< 200 nD) would still act as a highway for fluid flow.",

Here, we test the role of mantle flow at the rift-scale using our new, regional 3D numerical model based on the open-source code ASPECT. We define a thermal lithosphere with thicknesses that are systematically changed for generic models or based on geophysical constraints in the Western branch (e.g. melting depths, xenoliths, seismic tomography).

Information about how stishovite deforms under stress is important for understanding subduction of quartz-bearing crustal rocks into the mantle. Particularly, stishovite is elastically anisotropic and thus development of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) during deformation may contribute to seismic anomalies in the mantle.\nWe converted a natural sample of flint to stishovite in a laser heated diamond anvil cell and compressed the stishovite aggregate up to 38 GPa. Diffraction patterns were collected in situ in radial geometry at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and the Advanced Photon Source (APS) to examine development of CPO during deformation. We find that (001) poles preferentially align with the compression direction and infer deformation mechanisms leading to the observed CPO with visco-plastic self consistent (VPSC) polycrystal plasticity models.\nOur results show pyramidal and basal slip are most likely active at high pressure and ambient temperature, in agreement with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of rutile (TiO2) and paratellurite (TeO2), which are isostructural to stishovite. Conversely other TEM studies of stishovite done at higher temperature suggest dominant prismatic slip. This indicates that a variety of slip systems may be active in stishovite, depending on conditions. As a result, stishovite’s contribution to the seismic signature in the mantle may vary as a function of pressure and temperature and thus depth.",

Melt inclusions were analyzed for volatile contents using two different techniques, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and ion microprobe (SIMS). Data from FTIR on quartz-hosted melt inclusions reveal pre-eruptive CO2 concentrations (maximum ~ 300 ppm), and H2O contents (average = 4.3 wt.%) that are similar to H2O contents derived from SIMS on the same inclusions (average = 4.2 wt.%). Melt inclusions in sanidine yield higher CO2 concentrations (maximum ~ 400 ppm) than those hosted in quartz, yet yield much lower H2O contents (average = 2.5 wt.% via FTIR; average = 2.7 wt.% via SIMS). The higher CO2 trapped in sanidine-hosted melt inclusions may suggest higher trapping pressures than are recorded by quartz, whereas the low H2O recorded by sanidine may signify preferential H loss from sanidine. SIMS and Laser-Ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) trace element analyses of melt inclusions define a continuous liquid line of descent from sanidine-hosted inclusions that record high Sr and increasing Ba with crystallization, to quartz-hosted inclusions that record low Sr and decreasing Ba with crystallization. In the case of the Tara magmatic system, sanidine-hosted inclusions seem to record an earlier, deeper stage of the melt’s history. Assessing melt inclusions within multiple phenocryst hosts may provide insights into different stages of a melt’s history from storage to ascent and eruption.",

            "abstract": "An NSF-funded REU project (2011-2013), based in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), was designed to characterize the geology, geochemistry and geochronology of Precambrian rocks in northern YNP. Over two field seasons two cadres of 12 students (12 women and 12 men) were chosen from small-to-large state universities and private colleges. REU students participated in three major activities constituting a complete research experience: Field studies involved geologic mapping and sampling of Precambrian basement; formulation of testable research questions by smaller working groups; and mapping and sampling projects to address research questions; Analytical studies, sample preparation immediately followed field work with petrographic analysis at students' home institutions and a week-long visit to analytical laboratories to conduct follow-up studies by small research groups during the academic year (Univ. Florida - geochemistry and geochronology; Univ. Minnesota - EMPA analysis); Communicating results, each working group submitted an abstract and collectively presented 13 posters at the 2011 and 2012 GSA Rocky Mountain sectional meetings. We used directed discovery to engage students in a community of practice in the field and found that a long apprenticeship (2-3 weeks) is optimal for novice-master interactions in exploring natural setting. Initial group hikes were used to normalize methods and language of the discipline. Students developed a sense of ownership of the overall project and assumed personal responsibility for directed research projects. Training was provided to: guide students in selection and appropriate use of tools; develop sampling strategies; discuss communal ethics, values, and expectations; develop efficient work habits; stimulate independent thinking; and engage decision-making. It was important to scaffold the field experience to students’ level of development to lead to mastery. Analytical activities were designed from rock to analysis so that each group mastered all preparation steps and instrumental techniques under supervision of graduate mentors and lab managers leading to a clearer understanding of data interpretation. Students were communally engaged in abstract and poster preparation to ensure proper focus, scientific breadth, and style of presentation.",

            "abstract": "Improving the estimate of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Sierra Nevada has merit for California, given the ongoing drought that has lasted for years. In this study, we carried out an experiment to estimate SWE in the Upper Kern Basin, Sierra Nevada, by assimilating AMSR-E observed brightness temperatures (Tb) into a coupled hydrology and radiative transfer model using an ensemble Kalman batch reanalysis. The data assimilation framework merges the complementary SWE information from modeling and observations for an improved SWE estimate. The novelty of this assimilation study is that both the modeling and the radiance data processing were specifically improved to provide more information about SWE. With the enhanced SWE signals in both simulation and observation, the batch reanalysis should stand a better chance of successfully improving the SWE estimates.\nThe modeling was at a very high resolution (90m) and spanned a range of mountain environmental factors to better characterize the effects of the mountain environment on snow distribution and radiance emission. We have developed a dynamic snow grain size module to improve the radiance modeling during the intense snowfall events. The AMSR-E 37GHz V-pol observed Tb was processed at its native footprint resolution at ~100 km2. In the batch assimilation, the model predicted the prior SWE and Tb; the prior estimate of an entire year was then updated by the dry-season observations at one time. One advantage of this is that the prior SWE of a certain period is updated using the observations both before and after this period, which takes advantage of the temporally continuous signal of the seasonal snow accumulation in the observations.\nWe found the posterior SWE estimates showed improved accuracy and robustness. During the study period of 2003 to 2008, at point-scale, the average bias of the six-year April 1st SWE was reduced from -0.17 m to -0.01m, the average temporal SWE RMSE of the dry season and the entire year decreased by 51.2% and 11.7%, respectively. The basin-scale results showed that the average April 1st SWE bias reduced from -0.17m to -0.11m, and the temporal SWE RMSE of the dry season and the entire year decreased by 23.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Future work includes assimilating visible band observations to improve the overall SWE estimate in the ablation season.",

            "abstract": "We used the USEPA’s 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) data to assess the potential sensitivity of stream biodiversity to both spatial variation in measures of extreme flow and likely changes in extreme flows associated with projected climate change. The NRSA data consisted of macroinvertebrate samples collected at 1313 reference-quality sites. We characterized the hydrologic regimes at each of these sites by developing Random Forest empirical models from long-term (≥ 20 years) daily flow records obtained from 601 gaged USGS stations. These models described spatial variation in 16 flow variables as a function of climate and watershed attributes. Three of the models characterized aspects of extreme flow: the mean number of zero-flow events per year (ZeroDays), the mean number of high-flow events per year (HighDays = number of events per year that exceed the 95th percentile of mean annual flow), and the coefficient of variation of daily flows (CV). We used these models to predict the flow attributes expected at each of the 1313 sites with ecological data. We then built additional Random Forest models that related among-site differences in stream macroinvertebrate taxonomic composition, assemblage richness, and the likelihood of observing individual taxa to the 16 measures of flow regime and other environmental predictors. At the national level, ZeroDays was an important predictor of macroinvertebrate biodiversity: richness declined as ZeroDays increased. A similar pattern was observed when analyses were restricted to lowland and plains streams. For eastern highland streams, HighDays was a better predictor of stream biodiversity than aspects of low flow: richness declined as HighDays increased. For western streams, CV was a better predictor of biodiversity than either ZeroDays or HighDays: biodiversity decreased as CV increased. Empirical models that linked flow attributes to climate change projections imply that flow regime response to climate change will vary nationally with many currently intermittent streams becoming more permanent and many permanent streams becoming more intermittent. Ecological responses to climate change are therefore expected to exhibit similar idiosyncratic patterns with some streams losing biodiversity and other streams gaining biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "The mode of extension and crustal accretion may vary significantly during subduction margin evolution. Mantle water content likely has a strongly influence on this evolution as it strongly affects the mantle solidus and rheology. Effects of mantle hydration on volcanism and tectonics were examined in the southern Mariana margin in 2012 on a R/V Thompson cruise. The southern Mariana margin is actively rifting sub-parallel to the trench forming new crust and lithosphere directly above the de-watering slab (see Ribeiro et al. session T011). Shallow seismicity shows broadly distributed active deformation in the upper plate. Shallow-towed and near-bottom sidescan sonar data map a highly faulted terrain with rotated crustal blocks and distributed volcanic emplacements. The near-bottom sidescan sonar data also image an apparent corrugated core complex structure, the first such described from a convergent margin setting, indicating low-angle normal faulting during the extension. Water content in sampled volcanics is ~2 %, approaching that of the volcanic arc itself. Volcanic rocks from the eastern margin are mostly ~2-4 m.y. old, but younger basaltic volcaniclastics were recovered farther west suggesting that active volcanism may continue. We hypothesize that the broadly distributed volcanism and tectonic activity is due to high mantle water content that weakens the margin lithosphere. Continual water addition from the subducting slab inhibits melting-related dehydration and strengthening as has been proposed for lithosphere formed at mid-ocean ridges. A consequence of a broadening zone of rifting is that extension-related mantle upwelling rates will decrease with time. Surface cooling will thus progressively depress the mantle solidus, perhaps explaining the paucity of current observed volcanism at the margin. The volcano-tectonic processes active today in the southern Mariana margin may be modern analogs of those inferred at subduction zone infancy where broadly distributed contemporaneous extension and volcanism above the initially subducting and de-watering slab have been proposed. If so, and if ophiolites are relicts of early crust formed at subduction settings, they may reflect crustal accretion processes that differ significantly from those at mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "The Tertiary Nenana basin of Interior Alaska is currently the focus of both new oil exploration and coalbed methane exploitation and is being evaluated as a potential CO2sequestration site. The basin first formed as a Late Paleocene extensional rift with the deposition of oil and gas-prone, coal-bearing non-marine sediments with excellent source potential. Basin inversion during the Early Eocene-Early Oligocene times resulted in folding and erosion of higher stratigraphic levels, forming excellent structural and stratigraphic traps. Initiation of active faulting on its eastern margin in the middle Oligocene caused slow tectonic subsidence that resulted in the deposition of reservoir and seal rocks of the Usibelli Group. Onset of rapid tectonic subsidence in Pliocene that continues to the present-day has provided significant pressure and temperature gradient for the source rocks.\nApatite fission-track and vitrinite reflectance data reveals two major paleo-thermal episodes: Late Paleocene to Early Eocene (60 Ma to 54.8 Ma) and Late Miocene to present-day (7 Ma to present). These episodes of maximum paleotemperatures have implications for the evolution of source rock maturity within the basin.\nIn this study, we are also investigating the potential for coalbed methane production from the Late Paleocene coals via injection of CO2. Our preliminary analyses demonstrate that 150 MMSCF of methane could be produced while 33000 tonnes of CO2 per injection well (base case of ~9 years) can be sequestered in the vicinity of existing infrastructure. However, these volumes of sequestered CO2and coal bed methane recovery are estimates and are sensitive to the reservoir’s geomechanical and flow properties.\nKeywords: extensional rift, seismic, subsidence, thermal history, fission track, vitrinite reflectance, coal bed methane, Nenana basin, CO2 sequestration",

            "abstract": "The budget of atmospheric CO2 is commonly studied using records of CO2 concentrations and isotopic abundances. δ13C and δ18O are the most frequently used isotopic tracers and can be used to constrain marine and terrestrial fluxes. However, the large number of sources and sinks prevents concentrations, d13C and d18O alone from uniquely constraining the budget. Δ17O as well as clumped isotopologues of CO2 can provide independent constraints on CO2 fluxes. Here we present a record covering multiple 1+ year periods between 2003 and 2012 documenting seasonal variations at La Jolla, CA, of δ13C, δ18O and clumped isotopologues of CO2 as well as preliminary results for Δ17O. Samples were collected from the La Jolla pier only on days a seaward breeze was present, therefore local anthropogenic effects should be minimal. We report the clumped isotopologues of CO2 using Δ47 notation in the absolute reference frame.\n In the years studied, δ13C showed a seasonal cycle that is consistent with previous measurements and can be explained by the seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity of plants as well as a longer term trend of fossil fuel injection into the atmosphere. Similarly δ18O showed a seasonal and interannual cycle that is consistent with previous measurements and can be explained by the interaction of the terrestrial biosphere with the hydrologic cycle.\nThe La Jolla ∆47 record shows a strong seasonal pattern for all years studied, and initial results suggest seasonality is also present in ∆17O. The La Jolla ∆47 pattern is similar to the Pasadena ∆47 record collected for 2003-2004. Both records exhibit amplitudes and phasing of ∆47 variations that are not consistent with the equilibration of CO2 with the local air or sea surface temperatures, nor can they be explained by fossil fuel burning, which can only weakly influence the seasonal cycles. The seasonal cycle may be explained in part by a competition between low ∆47 from respiration sources and higher values from CO2-water exchange during photosynthesis and marine air-sea exchange. We construct a box model to explain our stable isotope results and quantify the sizes of the CO2 fluxes influencing our La Jolla samples.",

            "abstract": "Cryptotephras (tephra not visible to the naked eye) form the foundation of the tephrostratigraphic frameworks used in Europe to date and correlate widely distributed geologic, paleoenvironmental and archaeological records. Pyne-O’Donnell et al. (2012) established the potential for developing a similar crypto-tephrostratigraphy across eastern North America by identifying multiple tephra, including the White River Ash (east; WRAe), St. Helens We and East Lake, in a peat core located in Newfoundland. Following on from this work, several ongoing projects have examined additional peat cores from Michigan, New York State, Maine, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to build a tephrostratigraphic framework for this region. Using the precedent set by recent research by Jensen et al.(in press) that correlated the Alaskan WRAe to the European cryptotephra AD860B, unknown tephras identified in this work were not necessarily assumed to be from “expected” source areas (e.g. the Cascades).\nHere we present several examples of the preservation of tephra layers with an intercontinental distribution (i.e. WRAe and Ksudach 1), from relatively small magnitude events (i.e. St. Helens layer T, Mono Crater), and the first example of a Mexican ash in the NE (Volcan Ceboruco, Jala pumice). There are several implications of the identification of these units. These far-travelled ashes:\n(1) highlight the need to consider “ultra” distal source volcanoes for unknown cryptotephra deposits,.\n(2) present an opportunity for physical volcanologists to examine why some eruptions have an exceptional distribution of ash that is not necessarily controlled by the magnitude of the event.\n(3) complicate the idea of using tephrostratigraphic frameworks to understand the frequency of eruptions towards aiding hazard planning and prediction (e.g. Swindles et al., 2011).\n(4) show that there is a real potential to link tropical and mid to high-latitude paleoenvironmental records.\nJensen et al.

            "abstract": "In the Eastern Himalaya, the structure of the orogenic wedge above the subducting Indian lithosphere and even the Moho topography of the latter are poorly constrained at present. The Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) is considered a crustal-scale detachment that marks the plate boundary separating the bottom of the orogenic wedge from the top of the Indian crust. In western and central Himalaya portions of the MHT have been imaged by receiver functions (RF) from the surface near the foothills of the Himalayan front range to mid-crustal depths. In Bhutan, however, the MHT and other major thrust geometries at depth remain a matter of debate, without direct geophysical image. Furthermore, earthquake activity in Bhutan seems to be significantly lower compared to most other parts of the Himalayan arc and there appears to be a lack of great earthquakes. This lower level of seismicity could be related to a more ductile deformation in the orogenic wedge, or, alternatively, result from a currently locked situation of the thrust system.\nIn this work, we use data of a densely spaced, temporary seismic network in Bhutan (GANSSER experiment) to determine lithospheric and intra-crustal discontinuities in the Eastern Himalaya with RF complemented by seismic velocities derived from simultaneous inversion of local earthquake data. Along two south-north profiles across the Himalayan range in eastern and western Bhutan the geometry of the dipping Indian Moho is defined by migrated RF images including a dip correction. Based on the characteristics of the RF, the dip and strike of the Moho is independently defined and the occurrence of intra-crustal conversion interfaces like the MHT are mapped across the orogenic wedge.\nIn combination with the geometry of the intra-crustal seismic structure, we use the seismic velocities and the hypocenters of local earthquakes to discuss the predominant deformation type in the orogenic wedge in Bhutan and the potential for large earthquakes in this region of the India-Asia collision.",

            "abstract": "Model-based studies are foundational to perform diagnosis (has there been a change?) and attribution (what caused this change?) in the context of global environmental change. Here we employ a dual method approach using machine learning and simulation differencing across an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) to attribute changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) from 1901 to 2010. The simulations are taken from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP). For each TBM MsTMIP prescribes a semi-factorial set of five runs (globally at 0.5º spatial resolution) where time-varying controls on carbon metabolism are sequentially enabled. MsTMIP has a constrained simulation protocol –driving data, vegetation cover, boundary conditions, and steady-state spin up protocol are all standardized– such that only model structure varies and ensemble spread addresses process uncertainty. Applying this dual method to MsTMIP simulation output we attribute changes in GPP to changes in climate, land cover/land use change, atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deposition, near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and downwelling shortwave radiation as well as climate sigma (irreducible climate noise) and nonlinearity (interactions). Globally, the key factor associated with the Anthropocene, namely the sustained increase in atmospheric CO2, dominates changes in GPP across the full time period. Climate factors are of secondary importance and, along with land cover/land use change, may act to decrease GPP depending on decade and reference period. Despite differences in model structure attribution results across the full ensemble are generally consistent. Spatial morphologies, replicating the same dual approach by grid cell, exhibit high variability but with an atmospheric CO2 fertilization effect dominating the tropical zone. Our results suggest that the modern era of global warming, when viewed through the prism of GPP attribution, reaches back at least until the early 1900s.",

            "abstract": "Despite technical challenges encountered after its launch in 2003, NASA’s original Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) produced a rich topographic record, and provided our first large-scale assessments of elevation change and mass balance of the polar ice sheets. The lessons learned from this mission, combined with the availability of new technologies, have guided the design and development of the follow-on ICESat-2 mission and its Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). Scheduled for launch in 2017, ICESat-2 will operate year-round, at a lower orbit inclination, extending coverage to +/- 88 degrees latitude, and at a lower altitude, yielding 1,387 revolutions in a 91-day repeat ground track. The ATLAS instrument uses photon-counting detectors to record surface returns from six laser beams, grouped into three pairs, yielding denser spatial coverage and enabling direct measurements of local slopes. As a result, ICESat-2 will provide a more detailed view of the Earth’s surface. Here, we discuss the mission design and concepts of operations. We focus primarily on the strategies being developed for collecting altimetry data over different surfaces, including the ice sheets, sea ice, oceans, vegetation and other scientific targets of opportunity.",

            "abstract": "A great deal can be discovered from comparing and studying a chosen region or area on a planetary body. In this age, science has an enormous amount of instruments and data to study from; often the first obstacle can be finding the right information. Developed at Arizona State University, Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS), enables users to easily find and study related datasets. JMARS supports a long list of planetary bodies in our solar system, including Earth, the Moon, Mars, and other planets, satellites, and asteroids.\nWithin JMARS a user can start with a particular area and search for all datasets that have images/information intersecting that region of interest. Once a user has found data they are interested in comparing, they can view the image at once and see the numeric information at that location. This information can be analyzed in a few powerful ways.\nIf the dataset of interest varies with time but the location stays constant, then the user may want to compare specific locations through time. This can be done the Investigate Tool in JMARS. Users can create a Data Spike and the information at that point will be plotted through time. If the region does not have a temporal dataset, then a different method would be suitable and involves a profile line. Also using the Investigate Tool, a user can create a Data Profile (a line which can contain as many vertices as necessary) and all numeric data underneath the line will be plotted on one graph for easy comparison. This can be used to compare differences between similar datasets – perhaps the same measurement but from different instruments – or to find correlations from one dataset to another.\nA third form of analysis is planned for future development. This method involves entire areas (polygons). Sampling of the different data sources beneath an area can reveal statistics like maximum, minimum, and average values, and standard deviation. These values can be compared to other data sources under the given area.\nJMARS has the ability to geographically locate and display a vast array of remote sensing data for a user. In addition to its powerful searching ability, it also enables users to compare datasets using the Data Spike and Data Profile techniques. Plots and tables from this data can be exported and used in presentations, papers, or external software for further study.",

            "abstract": "Teaching global change is one of the great pedagogical challenges of our day because real understanding entails integrating a variety of concepts from different scientific subject areas, including chemistry, physics, and biology, with a variety of causes and impacts in the past, present, and future. With the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards, which emphasize climate change and other human impacts on natural systems, there has never been a better time to provide instructional support to educators on these topics. In response to this clear need, the University of California Museum of Paleontology, in collaboration with the National Center for Science Education, developed a new web resource for teachers and students titled “Understanding Global Change” (UGC) that introduces the drivers and impacts of global change. This website clarifies the connections among deep time, modern Earth system processes, and anthropogenic influences, and provides K-16 instructors with a wide range of easy-to-use tools, strategies, and lesson plans for communicating these important concepts regarding global change and the basic Earth systems processes.\nIn summer 2014, the UGC website was field-tested during a workshop with 25 K-12 teachers and science educators. Feedback from participants helped the UGC team develop and identify pedagogically sound lesson plans and instructional tools on global change. These resources are accessible through UGC’s searchable database, are aligned with NGSS and Common Core, and are categorized by grade level, subject, and level of inquiry-based instruction (confirmation, structured, guided, open). Providing a range of content and tools at levels appropriate for teachers is essential because our initial needs assessment found that educators often feel that they lack the content knowledge and expertise to address complex, but relevant global change issues, such as ocean acidification and deforestation. Ongoing needs assessments and surveys of teacher confidence when teaching global change content will continue to drive UGC resource development as the site expands in the future.",

            "abstract": "To meet water quality goals stormwater utilities and not-for-profit watershed organizations in the U.S. are working with citizens to design and implement green infrastructure on residential land. Green infrastructure, as an alternative and complement to traditional (grey) stormwater infrastructure, has the potential to contribute to multiple ecosystem benefits including stormwater volume reduction, carbon sequestration, urban heat island mitigation, and to provide amenities to residents. However, in small (1-10-km2) medium-density urban watersheds with heterogeneous land cover it is unclear whether stormwater retrofits on residential parcels significantly contributes to reduce stormwater volume at the watershed scale. In this paper, we seek to improve understanding of how small-scale redistribution of water at the parcel scale as part of green infrastructure implementation affects urban water budgets and stormwater volume across spatial scales. As study sites we use two medium-density headwater watersheds in Baltimore, MD and Durham, NC. We develop ecohydrology modeling experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of redirecting residential rooftop runoff to un-altered pervious surfaces and to engineered rain gardens to reduce stormwater runoff. As baselines for these experiments, we performed field surveys of residential rooftop hydrologic connectivity to adjacent impervious surfaces, and found low rates of connectivity. Through simulations of pervasive adoption of downspout disconnection to un-altered pervious areas or to rain garden stormwater control measures (SCM) in these catchments, we find that most parcel-scale changes in stormwater fate are attenuated at larger spatial scales and that neither SCM alone is likely to provide significant changes in streamflow at the watershed scale.",

            "abstract": "Harbors are typically modified to enhance operations and increase space in ports. Ports are usually designed to protect boats and docks against sudden vertical water fluctuations. Tsunami currents however are often ignored-current monitoring is usually not quantitative- in the design of harbor modifications. Damage from tsunami currents in ports has occurred in several recent tsunamis (Sea of Japan, 1983; Chile, 1960, 2010; Tohoku, 2011). Significant tsunami currents (>2 m/sec) often occur without substantial wave amplitudes (<1-2 meters). Because tsunami amplitudes are used as the basis to determine event “significance”, the hazard from potentially strong currents may be overlooked. In order to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic effects on tsunami impact at ports, we examine the history of man-made modifications made to San Diego Bay since the late nineteenth century.\nDigital elevation models were created based on historic nautical charts of 1892, 1935, 1945 and at present. Tsunami simulations were conducted based on two distant events (1960 Chile and 2011 Tohoku) and two hypothetical severe local cases (San Clemente fault bend and Coronado Canyon landslide). The distant events provide historical comparisons with the model while the local events are based on offshore geology and tectonic activity.\nMost of the changes in San Diego Bay have included dredging, enlargement of the North Island/Coronado, widening of the Silver Strand, and creation of new marinas by enhancing already existing dunes or filling and creating breakwaters. Those changes mostly occurred during the first half of the 20th century. Post- 1965 the bay has sustained a similar appearance to the bathymetry/topography we know today.\nEarly harbor configurations showed strong currents in the narrow channel between Point Loma and North Island/Coronado while overtopping of the narrow Silver Strand to the south occurred. The modern configuration finds increased currents at the harbor entrance and between Coronado and downtown San Diego, where the channel has been narrowed, while widening of the Silver Strand appears to reduce overtopping.\nSince the change in tsunami impact is not a linear function of modifications in the harbor, we will discuss on how these man-made modifications introduce or relocate strong currents and inundation in the bay.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenically contaminated soils pose a significant threat to biota across the world. Much of the literature on explosives contaminated soils has focused on individual or species level impacts while the larger plant community is often ignored. Our goal was to fill that gap and investigate impacts on community structure and diversity in an area contaminated with three common explosive compounds (RDX, TNT, Composition B). Community data were collected from an experimental minefield that was cleared 17 years ago, seeded with a surveyed grid of explosive compounds, and allowed to naturally revegetate. Plots within contaminated and reference sites were established. Woody and herbaceous species composition was recorded and species diversity and richness were calculated. Species composition and functional type data were analyzed using cluster analyses, multi-response permutation procedure analyses (MRPP), and detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) to investigate separation of the treatment groups.\nClassical diversity metrics were similar across treatments; however, cluster analyses and MRPP revealed significant differences in species and functional type composition. DCA of species composition showed no separation of treatment groups while DCA of functional traits showed that the TNT and Comp B plots contained a narrower range of functional traits, primarily due to life history and leaf characteristics, which differentiated them from the other treatment groups;. Differences between reference and contaminant sites in species composition and traits suggests that the presence of soil contaminants act as a physiological filter controlling which plant species establish and prosper. This in turn may have long lasting and significant impacts on the overall community composition and structure. Further research is needed to fully understand the community and ecosystem scale impacts of such contaminants.",

            "abstract": "Sources of volcano infrasound associated with explosive eruptions are typically modeled assuming an acoustic monopole and/or dipole. While the monopole represents the mass outflux of erupted materials, the dipole represents a force system acting in the source region during eruptions. Therefore, appropriate acoustic source inversions of volcano infrasound data can provide estimates of eruption parameters which are critical to understanding eruption dynamics. Reliability of the source parameters is dominantly controlled by the accuracy of the acoustic Green's functions between the source and receiver positions. Conventional source inversions of volcano infrasound, however, were typically performed using a simplified Green's function obtained in a free space or half space. This may result in intolerable errors in the source parameters, especially when the infrasound waveforms are significantly distorted by volcano topography and/or local atmospheric variability (i.e., layered velocity structure or wind). In this study we present a full waveform inversion technique for volcano infrasound using numerical Green's functions. A full 3-D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method accelerated with GPU is used to compute accurate Green's functions taking into account volcano topography and local atmospheric conditions. The presented method is applied to data recorded at Sakurajima volcano (Japan) and Tungurahua volcano (Ecuador), which provide a large volume of high-quality data recorded by azimuthally well-distributed stations within 2 -- 6 km distance of the volcanoes. We analyze infrasound signals associated with explosive eruptions exhibiting 1) distinct explosion waveforms followed by gas discharges and 2) strong anisotropic radiation patterns, which can be caused by either source directivity or topographic barriers/reflections. Here the role of topography in controlling the infrasound radiation is investigated through numerical modeling, and then the observed infrasound is inverted for the source parameters by using the modeled Green's functions. Finally, we investigate explosive source mechanisms for different types of eruptions considering the obtained monopole and dipole components.",

            "abstract": "The Tonga subduction zone is one of the most seismically active areas in the world, with a high rate of plate convergence between the subducting Pacific plate and the Tonga arc from 15°S to 25°S.However, seismically recorded large interplate thrusting events along the arc have not been larger than about Mw 8.0, and the degree of interplate seismic coupling has been inferred to vary from moderate to very low going from northern Tonga to southern Tonga [e.g., Scholz and Campos, 2012]. The possibility of this region experiencing a low probability maximum magnitude event of Mw8.57 up to 9.14 has been raised, but a paucity of geodetic observations and their distance from the Tonga trench have precluded assessments of slip deficit accumulation on the megathrust [Wallace et al., 2005]. Faulting mechanisms of historical large shallow earthquakes are uncertain [e.g., Okal et al., 2011], and some recent large events have been normal faulting or thrust-faulting intraslab events, so catalog-based assessments of seismic coupling are uncertain. Two recent large thrust-faulting earthquakes in 2006 and 2009 further complicate such assessments. The 3 May 2006 Mw8.0 event was located 100km west of the trench and caused a substantial regional tsunami, so it is sometimes assumed to be an interplate rupture. However, finite-fault modeling of teleseismic body waves supports a slip distribution centered about 60 km depth, consistent with centroid depths from W-phase (60.5 km) and global CMT (65 km) inversions. This was an intraslab thrust event with estimated stress drop of ~10 MPa. The fault plane is difficult to resolve unambiguously using teleseismic body waves, but joint inversion with static offsets from local GPS stations favors a shallow-dipping plane subparallel to the megathrust, or possibly a steeply dipping plane with triggered megathrust faulting. The 19 March 2009 Mw 7.6 thrust event occurred below the trench, and finite-fault and W-phase inversions indicate a 45km deep centroid. The fault plane is also difficult to establish. There continues to be a paucity of large megathrust earthquakes in Tonga.",

            "abstract": "The meridional overturning circulation in a wind-driven re-entrant channel arises from a balance between an Eulerian mean overturning and an eddy overturning. These cancel to leading order in the Southern Ocean's Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). An ACC-like flow, with realistic stratification, zonal transport and distributions of eddy kinetic energy, develops even when these two overturning components cancel completely. Many studies have noted that an enhancement of the Eulerian overturning circulation, which tends to steepen isopycnals, is balanced in part by an enhancement of the eddy circulation that relaxes isopycnal tilt. Thus the domain-averaged isopycnal slope and zonal transport are relatively insensitive to changes in wind forcing. However, the response of the system's mesoscale variability and eddy fluxes is not uniform throughout the domain. We present a process study of an idealized eddy-resolving ACC-like channel with negligible residual overturning to explore how the along-stream distribution of eddy characteristics establishes a balance between wind and eddy overturning circulations.\nFor each simulation, we decompose the overturning circulation into mean, standing and transient components. As the surface wind stress increases, the standing component balances a larger portion of the mean overturning. This in turn leads to an increasing departure from zonally-symmetric eddy characteristics. A zonal-mean, or net, eddy diffusivity Κnet is defined as the eddy diffusivity required to exactly balance the mean overturning based on the zonal-mean isopycnal slope, s. This gives Κnet=τ/ρ0fs, where τ is the wind stress, ρ0 is a reference density and f is the Coriolis parameter. Κnet is compared to local eddy diffusivities, Κlocal, diagnosed directly from the divergent component of the eddy buoyancy flux divided by the local isopycnal slope. We find that with a simple topographic ridge and moderate wind forcing, along-stream averages of Κlocal diverge from Κnet, and are typically smaller than Κnet. Strong “transport corridors,\" where Κlocal≥Κnet develop in the lee of topography. We explore the sensitivity of the Κlocal distribution and meander structure to wind forcing and to channel length, and we discuss the challenges this presents for eddy flux parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Seismic instrumentation for recording strong earthquakes, in Mexico, goes back to the 60´s due the activities carried out by the Institute of Engineering at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. However, it was after the big earthquake of September 19, 1985 (M=8.1) when the project of seismic instrumentation assumes a great importance.\nCurrently, strong ground motion networks have been installed for monitoring seismic activity mainly along the Mexican subduction zone and in Mexico City. Nevertheless, there are other major regions and cities that can be affected by strong earthquakes and have not yet begun their seismic instrumentation program or this is still in development.\nBecause of described situation some relevant earthquakes (e.g. Huajuapan de León Oct 24, 1980 M=7.1, Tehuacán Jun 15, 1999 M=7 and Puerto Escondido Sep 30, 1999 M= 7.5) have not been registered properly in some cities, like Puebla and Oaxaca, and that were damaged during those earthquakes. Fortunately, the good maintenance work carried out in the seismic network has permitted the recording of an important number of small events in those cities. So in this research we present a methodology based on the use of neural networks to estimate significant duration and in some cases the response spectra for those seismic events.\nThe neural model developed predicts significant duration in terms of magnitude, epicenter distance, focal depth and soil characterization. Additionally, for response spectra we used a vector of spectral accelerations. For training the model we selected a set of accelerogram records obtained from the small events recorded in the strong motion instruments installed in the cities of Puebla and Oaxaca. \nThe final results show that neural networks as a soft computing tool that use a multi-layer feed-forward architecture provide good estimations of the target parameters and they also have a good predictive capacity to estimate strong ground motion duration and response spectra.\n ",

We run these models for Carrington rotations 2056 – 2062 (April – November 2007), in which the solar wind was in the late declining phase and Ulysses had a fast latitudinal scan at 1.4 – 1.8 AU. We compare the modeling results with the in situ observations: OMNI data for L1, MESSENGER, Venus Express and Ulysses, all together covering 0.3 – 1.8 AU. We assess the capabilities of these models in capturing quasi-steady solar wind features including sector boundaries and the fast-slow stream interaction regions. For this particular period, we derive the strengths, weaknesses, and discrepancies from observations for each model, and discuss the effect of photospheric magnetograms from different observatories, such as GONG and SOLIS magnetograms from National Solar Observatory (NSO) and magnetograms from Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO).",

            "abstract": "GCM skill in the climate change-sensitive polar regions is a key factor in using them to predict future changes in ice sheet/shelf surface melting. Knowing why a GCM is wrong (or right) versus observed climate is also key. We address these topics by using a neural network-based tool, self-organizing maps (SOMs), to evaluate the variability and skill of modern GCM melt-season surface climates in Antarctica (January) and Greenland (July).\nThree scenarios test GCMs in contemporary polar settings: how well do models capture variability in a reference dataset (the ERA-Interim reanalysis, ERAI); locating GCMs in a “universal” data space covering all models plus ERAI; and how well do GCMs reproduce the patterns associated with extremes such as the July 2012 Greenland ice sheet melt event. In each case, SOMs abstract complex datasets (e.g., daily near-surface air temperature) into a relatively small set of generalized patterns representing dataset variability. We study 19 models from the CMIP5 archive that provide the sub-daily data needed for regional-scale modeling plus the recent 30-member CESM1.0-CAM5-BGC Large Ensemble.\nA SOM of ERAI (1981-2000) provides both a summary of variability in the reanalysis and a mapping of each GCM within the ERAI data space. How well GCMs reproduce ERAI pattern frequencies reflects GCM skill. With frequency differences indicating over/underoccurence of patterns, insights to mechanisms behind model skill are possible (albeit complex to develop).\nBy analyzing ERAI and CMIP5 models together, the “universal” SOM (1981-2000) summarizes the variability of multiple realizations of climate and helps place each GCM in a common context. For example, four main pattern groups can summarize Antarctic temperature: warm- and cold-everywhere and ocean/continent warm/cold dipoles. Warm GCMs are found in both the warm-everywhere group (MRI-CGCM3) and the warm continent/cold ocean group (BNU-ESM).\nERAI SOMs also provide context to test GCM skill versus extreme events. Analysis of 35 years (1979-2013) of Greenland temperature indicates that SOM patterns associated with the July 2012 ice sheet-wide melt event are present only since 2006. GCM skill in reproducing such statistics will inform our analyses of GCM-based predictions of future melting.",

            "abstract": "The Delaware River provides half of New York City's drinking water, is a habitat for wild trout, American shad and the federally endangered dwarf wedge mussel. It has suffered four 100‐year floods in the last seven years. A drought during the 1960s stands as a warning of the potential vulnerability of the New York City area to severe water shortages if a similar drought were to recur. The water releases from three New York City dams on the Delaware River's headwaters impact not only the reliability of the city’s water supply, but also the potential impact of floods, and the quality of the aquatic habitat in the upper river. The goal of this work is to influence the Delaware River water release policies (FFMP/OST) to further benefit river habitat and fisheries without increasing New York City's drought risk, or the flood risk to down basin residents. The Delaware water release policies are constrained by the dictates of two US Supreme Court Decrees (1931 and 1954) and the need for unanimity among four states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware ‐‐ and New York City. Coordination of their activities and the operation under the existing decrees is provided by the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC). Questions such as the probability of the system approaching drought state based on the current FFMP plan and the severity of the 1960s drought are addressed using long record paleo‐reconstructions of flows. For this study, we developed reconstructed total annual flows (water year) for 3 reservoir inflows using regional tree rings going back up to 1754 (a total of 246 years). The reconstructed flows are used with a simple reservoir model to quantify droughts. We observe that the 1960s drought is by far the worst drought based on 246 years of simulations (since 1754). However, there are intermediate drought warning periods and proper adaptation would be sufficient during these periods. Modified release rules that aid thermal relief to wild trout in the upper Delaware can be explored without much stress to the system during most periods.",

Measuring how these surfaces evolve in the face of a rapidly changing climate requires the utmost attention to detail in the design and calibration of these instruments, as well as understanding the changing optical properties of these surfaces. As single photon counting lidars, MABEL and NASA’s ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System) on the upcoming ICESat-2 mission provide fundamentally different information compared with waveform lidars such as ATM, or GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) on NASA’s previous ICESat-1 mission. By recording the travel times of individual photons, more detailed information about the surface, and potentially the subsurface, are available and must be considered in elevation retrievals from the observed photon cloud. Here, we investigate possible sources of uncertainty associated with monochromatic visible light scattering in subsurface snow, which may affect the precision and accuracy of elevation estimates. We also explore the capacity to estimate snow grain size in near surface snow using experimental visible light laser data obtained in laboratory experiments.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of zeta potential are typically obtained using crushed samples and commercial zetameters at ionic strength <1M. However, many natural brines have much higher salinity. This study reports zeta potential values interpreted from streaming potential measurements in two intact carbonate rock samples as a function of brine salinity (up to 5M) and potential determining ions (PDIs: Ca, Mg, SO4). The two samples appear to be identical pure carbonates in XRD analysis but differ in age and provenance.\nFor low salinity NaCl brines (<1M), in which the initial PDI concentration was established during pre-equilibration with the rock samples, the measured (negative) zeta potential decreased in magnitude with increasing NaCl concentration, consistent with published data and reflecting contraction of the electrical double layer. At higher NaCl salinity (>1M) the surface charge polarity was inverted for one rock sample, yet equilibrium Ca and Mg concentrations remained constant (c. 1.3x10-3 and 7x10-5M respectively) and similar for both samples, regardless of NaCl salinity. We suggest charge inversion was caused by differences in SO4 concentration (3x10-4 versus 1.2x10-3M) in the two samples after equilibration.\nAt higher and externally controlled concentrations of Ca (0.1 – 0.42M), the zeta potential was less affected by NaCl salinity and pCa was the dominant control, although the role of SO4 in distinguishing between rock samples remained valid. The iso-electric point was different for the two samples (pCa 1.7 versus 0.5) and lower than any previously published values. Our results suggest that small differences in PDI concentration may invert surface charge polarity at high NaCl concentration; moreover, trace amounts of anhydrite or other minerals that yield aqueous SO4 can significantly modify surface charge in carbonates that otherwise appear identical. These results are important when interpreting the streaming component of SP measurements in carbonates.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding problem effecting paleoclimate reconstructions from borehole temperature data is related to the subsurface noise from land use changes, in particular deforestation. Here a series of model experiments were conducted to explore the effect of deforestation on subsurface temperatures. The experiments were conducted using the land surface component of the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM) forced offline with CRU corrected NCEP reanalysis data. The model was spun-up for 500 years by repeating the 1900-1931 monthly climatology. Simulated deforestation was imposed globally at 100, 99, 90, 70, and 50% of the grid cell area. Deforestation was held for 10 years and thereafter ecosystems were allowed to recover. Baseline simulations were also conducted where no deforestation occurs. By examining the difference between the deforestation and baseline simulations the effect of deforestation on various model metrics is isolated. It is found that the change in subsurface temperature depends on the competing surface energy balance effects of an increase in surface albedo and decrease in surface roughness length induced from deforestation. In once heavily forested regions the net result is an increase in the surface and subsurface temperatures. The magnitude of the thermal noise due to deforestation can reach 1 K at 23 m depth in the decades following deforestation. The results of these experiments illustrate the need to take into account deforestation when conducting borehole derived climate reconstructions.",

The DEBOT model is primarily designed for modelling of ocean flow generated by the tidal attraction of the Moon and the Sun, however it can be used for other ocean applications where the barotropic model is sufficient, for instance, a tsunami wave propagation. The model has been thoroughly tested by several different methods: 1) synthetic example which involves a tsunami-like wave propagation of an initial Gaussian depression and testing of the conservation of integral invariants, 2) a benchmark study with another barotropic model, the LSGbt model, has been performed and 3) results of realistic simulations have been compared with data from tide gauge measurements around the world. The test computations prove the validity of the numerical code and demonstrate the ability of the DEBOT model to simulate the realistic ocean tides. The DEBOT model will be principaly applied in related geophysical disciplines, for instance, in an investigation of an influence of the ocean tides on the geomagnetic field or the Earth’s rotation. A module for modelling of the secondary poloidal magnetic field generated by an ocean flow is already implemented in the DEBOT model and preliminary results will be presented. The future aim is to assimilate magnetic data provided by the Swarm satellite mission into the ocean flow model.",

It has flexibility for selection of comparable physics options with NIM.\nTwo sets of experiments are designed: one is the control experiment with zonally-symmetric distributions with maxima at the equator and varying off-equatorial temperature gradients on ocean and land. The other experiment will impose the land/sea warming ratio of 1.5. Since two models can be set up with identical physics parameterizations, general consensus on responses and model-dependent feedback can be suggested.",

            "abstract": "As meteorological extremes intensify with a warming climate the resilience of land sink capacity remains an important question. The divergent or congruent response of ecosystem processes such as Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Respiration (R) hold important implications for atmospheric accumulation of CO2, as the net difference, or Net-Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), is the signal observed within the atmosphere. The turn-of-the-century drought has recently been highlighted as a test-case for the effect of water availability (as measured through evaporative fraction) on the current carbon dioxide sink that constitutes the western U.S. Here we leverage eddy co-variance FLUXNET observational data and expand on previous analyses to include observed ecosystem carbon flux response to surface air temperature, downwelling short-wave flux and evaporative fraction, as all three co-occur during drought, but the severity and duration of water availability and surface air temperature can vary significantly. The result is a comparison to previous ecosystem response analyses and an extrapolation to the more recent 2012 drought.",

            "abstract": "The Van Allen radiation belts contain highly energetic particles which interact with a variety of plasma and MHD waves. Waves with frequencies in the ULF range are understood to play an important role in loss and acceleration of energetic particles. We are investigating the contributions from perturbations in both the magnetic and the electric fields in driving radial diffusion of charged particles and wish to probe two unanswered questions about ULF wave driven radial transport. First, how important are the fluctuations in the magnetic field compared with the fluctuations in the electric field in driving radial diffusion? Second, how does ULF wave power distribution in azimuth affect radial diffusion? Analytic treatments of the diffusion coefficients generally assume uniform distribution of power in azimuth but in situ measurements suggest otherwise. We present results from a study using the electric and magnetic field measurements from the Van Allen Probes to estimate the radial diffusion coefficients as a function of L and Kp. During the lifetime of the RBSP mission to date, there has been a dearth of solar activity. This compels us to consider Kp as the only time and activity dependent parameter instead of solar wind velocity and pressure.",

The mean Mg/Ca ratio from the last three chambers was measured in seven tests of G. ruber and G. bulloides .Paleotemperatures were reconstructed using the equations of Anand et al (2003) for G. ruber and Mashiotta et al. (1999) for G. bulloides. The last chamber from G. ruber recorded Mg/Ca values which temperatures varied between 19 and 22°C. The temperatures obtained from the last chamber were lower than from the others two chambers, which temperatures varied between 24 and 26°C. This difference suggests the specie migrate to cold deeper waters during the calcification of the last chamber. It indicates that reconstructions based on the last chamber confronted with the mean of others two chambers could be used to estimate past water stratification. The Mg/Ca values of G. bulloides were not so different among the chambers, generating paleotemperatures between 18 and 22°C. However, G. bulloides’s individual variation coefficient was higher (14 – 48%) than G. ruber (12 – 28%), indicating the specie tolerates higher thermic amplitude due to its behavior related to searching by food. Cold surface waters and warmer sub-surface waters occurred between 9.0 and 7.2 kyr BP and the opposite occurring after 7.2 ka BP. The G. bulloides’s estimated cold episodes were marked before 8,0 ka BP, between 6.0 and 5.5 kyr BP, between 4.5 and 4.0 kyr BP and after 2.0 ka BP, which could be associated to upwelling intensity. The divergence of G. bulloides and G. ruber’s last chamber paleotemperatures suggest the species may not inhabit during the same time, which demands caution in stratification reconstructions based on these two species.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to investigate and compare the ability of the UK Met Office's HadGEM3-RA and HadRM3P regional climate models (RCMs) to simulate mean and interannual variability of precipitation over South America with a special focus on Chile. The HadGEM3-RA is a regional version of the newly developed HadGEM3 global model and the HadRM3P is based on the earlier HadCM3 global model. The RCMs simulations were carried out at 0.44o x 0.44o degree resolution over South America-CORDEX domain for the period 1989-2008. The initial and boundary conditions were provided by ERA-Interim Reanalysis data available at 6-h intervals with a resolution of 1.5o x 1.5o in the horizontal and 37 pressure levels. We compare the results against a number of observational datasets, including gridded dataset of CRU, UDEL, TRMM and GPCP. Moreover, available station data is derived from Direccion General de Aguas (DGA) mainly for Central Chile, which is the heartland of Chile with the highest population and important economic activities. The analysis is mainly focused on evaluating the abilities of the RCMs in simulating spatial pattern and ENSO related precipitation variability in different subregions of South America-CORDEX domain. In general, both RCMs have a good skill in reproducing spatial pattern and annual cycle of observed precipitation in climatically different subregions. However, both RCMs tend to underestimate precipitation in the Amazon Basin, which is more pronounced in the HadRM3P simulations. On the contrary, the RCMs tend to overestimate the precipitation over the Andes and southern Chile. The overestimation could be related to the physical core of the RCMs, but the discrepancies could also arise due to insufficient station network, especially in the mountainous areas, potentially yielding smaller precipitation quantities in the observed data than the true ones. In terms of interannual variability, the models capture ENSO related wet and dry interannual precipitation anomalies with some differences in the magnitude of precipitation. The study will be also extended with evaluation the ability of the RCMs and driving fields to simulate large-scale atmospheric fields in order to understand the biases in the regional simulations. Moreover, intercomparison of other South America-CORDEX simulations will be also included.",

            "abstract": "In many arid regions, including parts of California, a common pattern of groundwater use is to cultivate crops needing high levels of irrigation annually and accept unsustainable drawdown of groundwater levels in the near term. Reducing current pumping rates to create a protected reserve of groundwater could produce an economic benefit by mitigating the high cost of future droughts. The objective of our investigation is to quantify the economic benefits of reducing current pumping rates to protect groundwater as a backup irrigation source for long-term conditions. We describe the development and use of an integrated model of aquifer pumping, surface-water use, and economic conditions to identify economic values of groundwater protection as a drought mitigation measure. An optimization framework is developed using GAMS software to investigate conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and to solve an integrated economic model of crop irrigation and production. Data requirements for the analysis include precipitation, aquifer recharge, crop water requirements, size of groundwater reserve, surface water supplies, and economic factors such as crop prices, pumping costs and efficiency, and yields for selected crops. Our results indicate that economic values of groundwater reserve protection increase with future higher prices of crops and reduced costs of production. These economic values also increase with potential reductions in streamflows from future drought and climate variability that could raise the cost of irrigated agriculture. Results from the integrated GAMS optimization model are comparable to those obtained from simulations of the same conditions performed with MODFLOW-GWM software.",

            "abstract": "In [1] the first quantitative evidence of ionospheric outflows (r > 10,000 km) coming from Titan was given using the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) data for the T9 flyby. Later in [2] similar outflows were shown for T63 and T75. In [3] evidence for ionospheric outflows for T15 was given and [4] showed evidence of outflows for T41. Normally, the CAPS IMS cannot be used to measure Titan’s relatively dense ionosphere because the IMS has high sensitivity to measure the more tenuous plasmas of Saturn’s magnetosphere and its detectors will experience count rates beyond their maximum allowed rates, therefore the IMS is configured not to measure the ionospheric plasma. But, whenever there are high altitude Titan wake flybys the ion densities are low enough so the CAPS IMS can measure these ionospheric outflows and their corresponding composition characteristic of the topside ionosphere (i.e., composition freezes in above the exobase) using its unique compositional capabilities. For example, the IMS can distinguish against specific ion types such as hydrocarbon, nitrile and water group ions due fragmentation of molecular ions within the instrument (i.e., incident ions strikes ultra-thin carbon foils at 14.6 kV or higher with exiting fragments such C+,0,-, N+,0, O+,0,-1). The other ionospheric instruments only measure the ion mass-per-charge (M/Q), while the CAPS IMS measures both the ion M/Q and its fragments. Specific attention will be given to such ions as NH4+, N+, O+, CH4+, C2H5+, HCNH+ and C3H7+. These results may impose important constraints upon Titan’s ionospheric water group, hydrocarbon and nitrile ion chemistry. Are NH4+ ions present as indicated by INMS at 1100 km altitude and/or water group ions? Our work has concentrated on the T15 flyby. Estimates of the NH4+, N+ and O+ abundances presently have upper values < 20% of the total ion density with actual abundances and their uncertainties to be given.\n[1] Sittler, E.C.

Typical physical processes occurring at the magnetopause boundary layer include Kelvin-Helmholtz waves generated by shear flows, which provide multiple paths to affect inner-magnetospheric particle density and energy fluxes. In particular, nonlinearly-developed forms of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, called Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, generate field-aligned currents via vortical motion of plasmas that leads to a twist or magnetic shear of the flux tube. A clockwise (counter-clockwise) rotation, as viewed in the direction of the magnetic field, in association with Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices in the dusk (dawn) flank of the magnetopause leads to upward (downward) field-aligned current inside the flux tube. We present in-situ Cluster, THEMIS, and FAST spacecraft observations of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and associated physical processes that map to the poleward edge of the auroral regions together with ground-based observations (magnetograms, riometer data, and all sky images) to link boundary fluctuations to variations of the inner magnetospheric/ionospheric phenomena.",

This observation indicates extensive interaction with freshwater, possibly when the terraces were uplifted through a coastal aquifer that existed along the shores of the GOA, implying a wetter climate during time of recrystallization from aragonite to calcite. Thus, dating of the recrystallization events should yield timing of past wet conditions in the current hyper-arid area of the GOA. In the current study 16 samples of aragonitic and calcitic corals were collected from several uplifted coral terraces off the coast south to the city of Aqaba. While aragonite corals were dated with the conventional closed system (with no initial Th) age equation, the dating of the calcitic corals required the development of adequate equations that allow the calculation of both the initial cystallization age of the coral and time of recrystallization to calcite. The two age calculations were based on the assumptions that each reef terrace went through a single major recrystallization event and that the pristine aragonite corals had an initial U concentration in the range of 2.5-3 ppm (typical for pristine modern corals). Two recrystallization events were identified: at 124±30 ka BP and 106±7 ka BP, which coincide with the timing of sapropel events S5 and S4 when the African monsoon induced enhanced wetness in the desert area (e.g. Torfstein et al., 2014). The original reef deposition ages were calculated to be: ~ 129-127±8 ka BP, 112±3 ka BP and 5.7±0.3 ka BP, matching the interglacial peaks of global sea level high stands MIS5e, MIS5c and the mid-Holocene high stand.",

Here we present the functionality of Virtual California, a numerical simulator that can generate sample surface deformations, surface gravity changes, and InSAR interferograms in addition to producing earthquake statistics and forecasts.\nVirtual California is a boundary element code designed to explore the seismicity of today’s fault systems. For arbitrary input fault geometry, Virtual California can output simulated seismic histories of 50,000 years or more. Using co-seismic slips from the output data, we generate surface deformation maps, surface gravity change maps, and InSAR interferograms as viewed by an orbiting satellite. Furthermore, using the times between successive earthquakes we generate probability distributions and earthquake forecasts.\nVirtual California is now supported by the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics. The source code is available for download and it comes with a users’ manual. The manual includes instructions on how to generate fault models from scratch, how to deploy the simulator across a parallel computing environment, etc.\nhttp://geodynamics.org/cig/software/vc/",

We find that the climatological mean Antarctic energy budget is characterized by an approximate balance between the TOA net outgoing radiation and the horizontal convergence of atmospheric energy transport, with the net surface energy flux and atmospheric energy storage generally being small in comparison. We compare these observationally-based results with coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulations that have been made available as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5 (CMIP5). While CMIP5 models generally perform well in simulating the observed climatological mean energy budget, some notable model biases are apparent. These biases are most pronounced during the austral summer and fall seasons, with the largest biases (approaching 30 W m-2 for some models) occurring for the TOA net incoming shortwave radiation during summer. Finally, we examine the causes of model biases (e.g., deficiencies in the simulated cloud cover and sea ice), as well as their relationship to the simulated twenty-first century trends in the energy budget. We find a statistically significant inverse correlation across the CMIP5 models between the present-day biases in atmospheric energy transport into the polar cap, and the simulated future changes in energy transport over the twenty-first century. Possible reasons for this relationship are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Heavy ion dropouts in the solar wind are thought to originate from large, closed coronal loops. The distinctive, mass-dependent fractionation patterns of the dropouts requires that their source loops are relatively quiet and stable long enough (on the order of a day) to undergo gravitational settling. Therefore by studying the composition of heavy ion dropouts we are able to peer into the solar corona and glean information about the fine balance of physical processes. Additionally, the occurrence rates and magnetic profiles of dropouts suggest specific forms of magnetic reconnection are responsible for the release of the otherwise trapped plasma into the solar wind.\nIn this study we identify and compare dropouts observed by two different satellites, ACE and Ulysses, which together provide over 20 years of continuous observations at a variety of heliographic latitudes and radii. The resulting partial global view (or 3D view) enables us to identify coronal source regions and release mechanisms of heavy ion dropouts. We also discuss a physical model of gravitational settling which can be used to reconcile fractionation rates with the rate at which plasma must be escaping via reconnection. Our conclusions and results may contribute towards the ongoing refinement and validation of theories which predict the origin of “slow type” solar wind.",

What are the consequences of this degassing for habitability and extinction? In this presentation, we consider this question in the context of Siberian Traps magmatism, which has been shown to overlap within geochronologic uncertainty with catastrophic deterioration of Permian-Triassic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. To investigate the impacts of endogenic gases on climate, atmospheric chemistry, and ocean circulation, we conducted a series of numerical experiments with a comprehensive global model for the Permian-Triassic. Our simulations predict the intensity and distribution of acid rain and ozone depletion, with implications for terrestrial biota. We further explore feedbacks between sulfur emissions, transient cooling, and shifts in ocean circulation. We suggest that Siberian Traps magmatism may have triggered several distinct kill mechanisms in the oceans and on land, contributing to a complex combined pattern of environmental stress and latest Permian ecological failure.",

            "abstract": "Worldwide, selenium (Se) is proving to be a significant environmental concern, with many anthropogenic activities (e.g. coal mining and combustion, phosphate mining and agricultural irrigation) releasing potentially hazardous concentrations into surface and subsurface ecosystems. The US EPA is currently considering aquatic Se regulations, however no guidelines exist for excess soil Se, despite its ability to act as a persistent Se source. Various abiotic and biological processes mediate Se oxidation/reduction (redox) transformations in soils, thus influencing its solubility and bioavailability. In this research we assess (1) the ability of metal-transforming fungal species to aerobically reduce Se (Se (IV and/or VI) to Se(0)), and (2) the relative contribution of biotic and abiotic pathways for aerobic Se transformation. The primary objective of this research is to determine what abiotic and biotic factors enhance or restrict Se bioavailability.\nResults indicate that fungal-mediated Se reduction may be quite widespread, with at least 7 out of 10 species of known Mn(II)-oxidizing fungi isolated from metal impacted environments also identified as capable of aerobically reducing Se(IV) and/or Se(VI) to Se(0). Increasing concentrations of selenite (SeO32-; Se(IV)) and selenate (SeO42-; Se(VI)) generally reduced fungal growth rates, although selenate was more likely to inhibit fungal growth than selenite. To study oxidation, Se(0) was combined with Mn(III/IV) (hydr)oxides (henceforth referred to as Mn oxides), Se-transforming fungi (Alternaria alternata), and oxalic acid to mimic Se biogeochemistry at the plant-soil interface. Increased pH in the presence of fungi (7.2 with fungi, 6.8 without fungi after 24 days) was observed. Additionally, a slight decrease in redox potential was measured for incubations without Mn oxides (236 mV with Mn oxides, 205 mV without Mn oxides after 24 days), indicating that Mn oxides may enhance Se oxidation. Elemental Se oxidation rates to Se(IV and/or SeVI) and extent will also be determined by measuring dissolved Se(IV) and Se(VI). Results from this research are key for understanding Se-transforming reactions in soils, and the role of both biotic and abiotic factors in influencing Se bioavailability and mobility within and out of contaminated ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "This study extends the popular triple collocation method for error assessment from three source estimates to an arbitrary number of source estimates, i.e., to solve the multiple collocation problem. The error assessment problem is solved through Pythagorean constraints in Hilbert space, which is slightly different from the original inner product solution but easier to extend to multiple collocation cases. The Pythagorean solution is fully equivalent to the original inner product solution for the triple collocation case. The multiple collocation turns out to be an over-constrained problem and a least squared solution is presented. As the most critical assumption of uncorrelated errors will almost for sure fail in multiple collocation problems, we propose to divide the source estimates into structural categories and treat the structural and non-structural errors separately. Such error separation allows the source estimates to have their structural errors fully correlated within the same structural category, which is much more realistic than the original assumption. A new error assessment procedure is developed which performs the collocation twice, each for one type of errors, and then sums up the two types of errors. The new procedure is also fully backward compatible with the original triple collocation. Error assessment experiments are carried out for surface soil moisture data from multiple remote sensing models, land surface models, and in situ measurements.",

            "abstract": "Turbiditic deposits consist of alternating sandstones and shales of various thicknesses. This complex sedimentary architecture produces multiple hierarchies of heterogeneities and controls the development of fractures and faults at various scales. Typically stiff units (e.g., sandstones and siltstones) have a predominantly brittle behavior and produce joints, which propagate across layers characterized by homogeneous mechanical properties and terminate against the boundaries of the so-called mechanical units. Joints provide weak planes for later shearing, leading to the clustering of joint zones and eventually the nucleation of faults. These faults may reach large extents through linkage of neighboring fractures and fault segments. However, the evolution and linkage of the faults is controlled by an interplay between the mechanical properties of the rock units and the fault slip. To evaluate both lateral and vertical continuity of fault zones, which are fundamental for assessing their fluid flow properties, it is desirable to identify what class of heterogeneities may inhibit the fault propagation. This structural framework is also important evidence supporting DFN contaminant transport models used to describe and predict plume behavior at the site.\nFor this contribution we carried out a multi-scale analysis of the fault and fractures cutting across the turbidite sequence of the Chatsworth Formation (Simi Hills, CA). By means of collecting quantitative structural data for both background and fault-related structures, we established the hierarchy of faults and fractures based on their length, height, width, and offset and spacing where available. Detailed structural maps were integrated with scanline surveys to characterize the architecture of the single structures and identify their stage of development.\nFinally, detailed characterization of contaminant distributions from continuous core sampling at the site TCE source and plume corroborate the presence of numerous, multi-scaled, hydraulically active fractures required to match the observed plume migration distance over past decades, thus providing a robust analysis of the hydraulic behavior of structures making up various hierarchical classes within the structural framework.",

The objective is to characterize the water mass properties as compared with historical data and considering climate modes of variability. Tracer ages (CFCs and SF6) are used to provide constraints on time scales of physical and biogeochemical processes. The GEOTRACES transect contains eutrophic and oligotrophic stations. In between, there is a large oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) created by a shadow zone in the subtropical gyre circulation. The major water masses in the upper 1500 m are the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) found below the 27 σθ, Subantarctic Mode Water located above the AAIW and below the 26.5 σθ, South Pacific Eastern Subtropical Mode Water found along 25.5 σθ near 100°W, South Pacific Subtropical Under Water follows 25 σθ, and South Pacific Subtropical Water is located at the surface west of 110°W. Water with SF6 ages of less than 30 years are found above 26.5 σθ. The highest apparent oxygen utilization rates (AOUR) found in the coastal region are likely due to the upwelling in this region. The central gyre region shows the lowest AOUR, corresponding with the oligotrophic conditions. In between, the OMZ, ranging from 80⁰W to about 120⁰W, has a median AOUR. An analysis of our data compared to WOCE data at 4 co-locations shows changes in the water properties and biogeochemical processes over a 20 year time period. This analysis suggests an expansion and a strengthening of the OMZ in the past 20 years. While there is a decrease in oxygen content within the OMZ, there is a slight increase in AOU in the western part of the OMZ.",

The stratigraphic interval covers the uppermost 7.2 m of the Maastrichtian. The proxy records provide insight on the paleoclimatological conditions of this interval, and make an evaluation of the potential imprint of astronomical climate forcing possible. Lithologic variations (MS and CaCO3) are mainly reflecting the terrigenous influx (i.e. wind-blown dust) in the deep marine setting of Gubbio around the time of deposition. The availability and transport of this dust is hypothesized to be a function of the vegetation cover on large source areas in the African and/or Euro-Asian continents. This vegetation cover would be susceptible to changes in the monsoonal circulation intensity and patterns. The monsoon and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITZC) are determined by insolation, which in turn is controlled by the precession and obliquity. A vegetation-cover-threshold mechanism is proposed to explain eccentricity related periodicities in the MS record. Together with the dust influx in this tropical western Tethyan basin, both oceanic and terrestrial mechanisms depending on the precession amplitude modulated by eccentricity are proposed to explain the detected eccentricity periodicity in the δ13C record. The astronomical interpretation proposed in this study suggests that high eccentricity corresponds to relatively low δ13C and MS maxima values. Based on this phase relationship, an astronomical tuning of the Maastrichtian section is elaborated. The Maastrichtian part of magnetozone C29r has a duration of ~370 kyr. The duration of several biozones of the uppermost Maastrichtian is calculated. Tentative interpretations of the δ18O record and the astronomical interpretation of the MS record hint towards a warming event ~400 kyr prior to the K-Pg.",

Over Antarctica, persistent katabatic winds produce extreme blowing snow events often covering 100,000 square kilometers or more and reaching heights of 300-400 meters. New techniques of blowing snow detection using active and passive satellite data are providing a new understanding of the frequency, magnitude and spatial coverage of blowing snow over and around the Antarctic continent. Current research is utilizing these methods to obtain a nearly 10 year climatology of blowing snow events over Antarctica and estimate the amount of mass being blown off the continent and sublimated into the atmosphere on an annual basis. In addition, recent research indicates that blowing snow over sea ice may be important in the process of transporting seal salt aerosol into the atmosphere where it is implicated in the production of bromine compounds that strongly influence many aspects of tropospheric chemistry.",

Patterns of vertical crustal displacements are commonly considered the key fingerprints of GIA, with maximum uplift marking the position of former ice load centers. However, efforts to develop more realistic 3D earth models have shown that the horizontal motion pattern is a more important signature of GIA on a laterally varying earth. Here we provide the first measurements substantiating predictions of a reversal of horizontal motions across an extreme gradient in crustal thickness and mantle viscosity crossing Antarctica. GPS results document motion toward, rather than away from the sites of major ice mass loss in West Antarctica. When compared in a common reference frame, observed crustal motions are not in agreement with predictions from models of GIA. A gradient in crustal velocities, faster toward West Antarctica, is spatially coincident with the rheological boundary mapped from seismic tomographic results. This suggests that horizontal crustal motions are strongly influenced by laterally-varying earth properties, and demonstrates that only 3D earth models can produce reliable predictions of GIA for Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "African ecosystems are at great risk due to climate and land-use change. Despite the status of several of these regions as biodiversity hotspots, long-standing ideas about African ecology and biogeography have been unable to be tested until now due to lack of sufficiently long records. Here, we present the first long, continuous terrestrial record of vegetation from Lake Malawi, East Africa which goes back to the early Late Quaternary, permitting us to investigate changes in physiognomy and forest composition over many transitions. In this record, we observe eight phases of forest expansion and collapse. Although diversity is much greater during forest phases, composition varies little from phase to phase. Very high abundances of afromontane taxa suggest frequent widespread colonization of the lowlands by modern high elevation trees. Although there are clear successional stages within each forest such that turnover is great within a single phase, among forest samples between phases, there is little dissimilarity. Each forest phase is interrupted by rapid decline of arboreal taxa and expansion of semi-arid grasslands or woodlands whose composition varies greatly from phase to phase. The variable composition of the more open phases, all occurring during arid periods, is likely dynamically linked to thresholds in regional hydrology associated with lake level and moisture recycling within the watershed. This vegetation is unlike any found at Malawi today, with assemblages suggesting strong Somali-Masai affinities. Furthermore, nearly all semi-arid assemblages contain small abundances of forest taxa typically growing in areas with wetter edaphic conditions, suggesting that moist lowland gallery forests were present but restricted to waterways during exceptionally arid times. The waxing and waning of forests throughout this interval has important implications for early human biogeography across Africa as well as disturbance regimes that are crucial for the maintenance of modern East African landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of hillslope and riparian water table dynamics across headwater catchments remains challenging. We suggest that this is partially due to the lack of spatially distributed, high frequency, long duration observations of shallow subsurface flows that connect hillsopes to riparian and stream landscape positions. Further, these observations are rarely considered in the context of both local and watershed scale structure and organization. Here, we provide a synthesis of shallow subsurface hydrologic connectivity duration and magnitude across 9 years of hourly stage recordings for 30 transects of shallow groundwater wells (hillslope size from 0.07 to 4.6 ha) in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, MT. Key results include: 1) the annual average water table depth across all hillsope wells was exponentially related (r2 = 0.94) to upslope accumulated area (UAA). 2) K means analysis of the annual hilllsope water table stage duration curves indicated a transition across the continuum of wells from short duration hydrologic connectivity and low stage (UAA = 0.07 – 1ha, n= 90), sustained snowmelt hydrologic connectivity and moderate stage (UAA = 1.2 – 3ha, n = 20), and continuous hydrologic connectivity and highest stage (UAA = 3.1 – 4.6ha, n=11). 3) hillslopes with the largest UAA (n= 11; continuous connectivity and sustained groundwater stage) exhibited groundwater dynamics similar to those in riparian wells. The synthesis of the well water stage responses across space and time suggests strong emergent behavior according to landscape position and topography. These preliminary analyses provide insight into watershed behavior that is requisite for understanding where streamflow originates in the landscape, appropriate model structures for predicting streamflow, predicting landscape position sensitivity to climate variability, and informing land management decisions.",

            "abstract": "For experimental analysis of infragravity waves in a dissipative beach we carried out a field campaign. A crosshore array of pressure sensors, located outside the surf zone and inside the surf zone, was used. These sensors measured for 12 hours continuously with a rate of 1 Hz by 3 days. A Fourier analysis was applied to the free surface data to identify infragravity energy. A FIR filter was applied to obtain the infragravity signal along the array of pressure sensors; we found an increase in the height of the infragravity wave as it approaches to the coast of almost 50%. The evolution of the infragravity wave signal was analyzed outside and inside the surf zone for the biggest wave event recorded in the field campaign, finding a significant increase in the height of the infragravity wave. Finally, using a wavelet analysis we observed that as the infragravity wave was approaching to the coast, the energy within the infragravity frequencies increase for lower frequencies. For the numerical analysis of infragravity waves in the dissipative beach, we use the SWASH model that is a non-hydrostatic model which phase-resolves the free surface and fluid motions throughout the water column. The model was validated (Willmott index of 95% of agreement between the simulated and measured time series) with data from the experimental array of pressure sensors. We ran the model by changing the boundary condition to analyze the swash oscillation in the selected beach. We found that the model was able to predict the swash oscillation and confirms that in a dissipative beach the energy in the swash zone was dominated by the infragravity energy. These results help to understand the role of infragravity regime in coastal flooding processes and morphological changes in natural beaches.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s inner and outer radiation belts are surrounded by a natural high intensity radiation environment, composed of high energy and relativistic particles. The dynamic outer plasmasphere overlaps the outer radiation belt beyond L=2.5 and can play a key role in modulating the outer radiation belt. In particular, ambient cold plasma density associated with plasmaspheric structure and density gradients in the plasmasphere boundary layer (PBL) can regulate the occurrence and characteristics of wave-particle interactions (WPI) leading to large changes in precipitation/loss efficiency. These interactions are efficient at scattering high energy particles into the atmospheric loss cone, resulting in spatially localized enhancements in outer radiation belt acceleration and precipitation.\nWe discuss a multi-point observational case study of the relationship of dayside radiation belt precipitation temporal and spatial dynamics to outer plasmasphere processes during a coronal mass ejection driven shock injection and plasmasphere reconfiguration event on 2014-01-09. We combine in-situ magnetosphere diagnostics from the Van Allen Probes A and B spacecraft with in-situ data from multiple BARREL balloons measuring atmospheric precipitation in the afternoon MLT sector, near the Van Allen Probes magnetic footprints. Van Allen Probes and THEMIS E data from their respective EFW instruments determines electric field structure and thermal electron density configurations to L~7. Finally, we place the in-situ diagnostics in a larger context using GPS ground based total electron content observations of L <= 4 wide field plasmaspheric structure and PBL dynamics. We present analysis explaining the observed atmospheric precipitation, and demonstrating the significance of the outer plasmasphere boundary location in processes leading to energetic electron precipitation. Such multi-instrument analysis demonstrates that consideration of interconnected system-level processes leads to a clearer understanding of the characteristics of individual features.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) presents a triple threat to the global environment: it is the third most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, the largest remaining anthropogenic contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion, and an important component of the nitrogen (N) cascade – where one atom of N can interconvert between a number of forms, each with a unique set of environmental impacts. Here we use a dynamic vegetation model (Princeton-Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab (GFDL) LM3 – the interactive land component of the GFDL Earth System Model) to assess how changes in future climate, land-use, and global fertilizer and manure application are projected to affect global N2O emissions from agriculture by 2050. Agricultural land is defined in this study as the sum of cropland and pasture. In a baseline scenario assuming little improvement in global N use efficiency (NUE) by 2050, the model projects a 24-31% increase in global agricultural N2O emissions (with the uncertainty range stemming from differences in climate forcing, land-use and fertilizer and manure consumption between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, the two climate scenarios used in this study) – rising from 2.9 Tg N2O-N yr-1 in 1990-2000 to 3.6-3.8 Tg N2O-N yr-1 in 2040-2050. This emission increase is considerably less than the projected increases in global fertilizer and manure consumption (42-44%) and previously published projections of global agricultural N2O emission increases (38-75% - again, the uncertainty range reflecting the differences between the climate scenarios used). This disparity appears to be a result of ecological feedbacks captured by the model, where a considerable portion of the increase in fertilizer and manure use is absorbed by agricultural plant biomass rather than lost to the environment. In addition to this dynamic, the model projects that improvements in global NUE of 20-50% could reduce global N2O emissions significantly, delivering important climate and stratospheric ozone benefits over the period 2015-2050: avoiding up to 9.9 Gt CO2 eq. and 567 ODP kt, respectively. This is equivalent to about two years of the CO2 emissions of all the passenger cars currently on the road and 25-35% of the potential reductions from the destruction of the remaining recoverable stocks of other ozone depleting substances.",

            "abstract": "Long and short-term tectonic activity plays an essential role in the segregation, transport and emplacement of fluids and magmas within the continental crust. Magma ascent and emplacement mechanisms within volcanic arcs are largely controlled by the interplay between pre-existing structural anisotropies, regional stress field, magmatic driving pressure, and the viscous resistance to magma flow. For the upper crust, many authors have stated that the orientation of principal tectonic stresses may determine the spatial distribution and geometry of eruptive vents and related feeder dykes Thus, regional and/or local tectonics (differential stresses) may exert a fundamental control in volcanic morphology and produce linear eruptive arrays of Andean-type strato-volcanoes, as a result of stability on long-lived structural system of sub-parallel dyke swarms and aligned minor eruptive centers along volcano flanks. In South-central Chile, the Callaqui Volcano consists of tens of aligned Pleisto-Holocene eruptive vents and hundreds of sub-parallel dykes, preserved along the ENE-WSW Callaqui volcano ridge. Morpho-structural field mapping and remote sensing analysis yields that Pleistocene eruptive vents are aligned into a N60°E-trending en echelon array, whereas its elliptical craters maximum diameter trend N66°E. Post-glacial eruptive vents also are organized into a N60°E trend, observed in both, isolated talweg scoria cone and flank fissural eruption. In addition, sub-parallel, underlying dyke swarms strike N60°E in it central portion of the volcanic system, becoming nearly E-W on distal zones. Examination of morphometrical and structural data yields that emplacement of magma occurs within a dextral transtensional regime, along a major regional discontinuity recognized previously by other authors. The strain field obtained within this study is consistent with the regional ENE shortening derived by the oblique convergence between Nazca and South-American plates.",

            "abstract": "The Utah Geological Survey’s (UGS) Geologic Hazards Program has partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create geologically derived web-based flood hazard maps. Flooding in Utah communities has historically been one of the most damaging geologic hazards. The most serious floods in Utah have generally occurred in the Great Salt Lake basin, particularly in the Weber River drainage on the western slopes of the Wasatch Range, in areas of high population density. With a growing population of 2.9 million, the state of Utah is motivated to raise awareness about the potential for flooding. The process of increasing community resiliency to flooding begins with identification and characterization of flood hazards. Many small communities in areas experiencing rapid growth have not been mapped completely by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). Existing FIRM maps typically only consider drainage areas that are greater than one square mile in determining flood zones and do not incorporate geologic data, such as the presence of young, geologically active alluvial fans that indicate a high potential for debris flows and sheet flooding. Our new flood hazard mapping combines and expands on FEMA data by incorporating mapping derived from 1:24,000-scale UGS geologic maps, LiDAR data, digital elevation models, and historical aerial photography. Our flood hazard maps are intended to supplement the FIRM maps to provide local governments and the public with additional flood hazard information so they may make informed decisions, ultimately reducing the risk to life and property from flooding hazards. Flooding information must be widely available and easily accessed. One of the most effective ways to inform the public is through web-based maps. Web-based flood hazard maps will not only supply the public with the flood information they need, but also provides a platform to add additional geologic hazards to an easily accessible format.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake swarms are common in volcanic regions where fluids exsolved from magma bodies may trigger a sequence of earthquakes as they episodically transit from ductile surroundings into the neighboring brittle crust. Such swarms do not fit mainshock-aftershock patterns commonly seen with tectonic seismicity. Similar swarms are increasingly being observed in association with industrial fluid injection. Here, we investigate and compare earthquake swarms at Long Valley Caldera (a volcanic center) and Azle, Texas (near active industrial production and wastewater-disposal wells). We perform waveform-correlation-based event detection coupled with double-difference relative location, using catalog events as waveform templates to examine their space-time evolution. This greatly enhances the earthquake catalog, providing locations for ~4 times as many events as in the routine catalog, with location precision often better than 10 m. Despite differences in depth, fluid chemistry, and tectonic environment, we find pronounced spatiotemporal migration of earthquake hypocenters in both of these swarms.\nBoth swarms occurred on well-defined fault structures. The Long Valley south moat swarm followed an inactive, steeply dipping fault zone. Earthquakes began ~7.5 km beneath the surface on 7 July 2014, propagated dominantly upward and northward ~600 m in the first 12 hours, and continued sporadically into late July 2014. The Azle swarm of 28-29 January 2014 activated an ancient normal fault at shallow depths of ~3 km, just below the injection and extraction horizon, and propagated ~400 m northeastward along strike and bilaterally along dip over ~12 hours. For both swarms, we hypothesize that the migration of hypocenters reflects corresponding diffusion of a fluid pressure front within pre-existing fault zones. In some cases we observe larger earthquakes followed by rapid (but not instantaneous) propagation of events into previously inactive zones, perhaps reflecting enhanced permeability and accelerated fluid pressure diffusion via the newly ruptured fault patch. By integrating observations from natural and induced earthquake swarms, we aim to understand factors controlling the combined physics of faulting and fluid pressure diffusion in the crust.",

            "abstract": "Long-standing debate has focused on the timing, mode, and direction of Colorado River integration, either down or up river. Miocene–Pliocene Colorado River deposits are well exposed in the lower Colorado River corridor (i.e. Bouse Fm and Bullhead Alluvium). There, improved geochronologic constraints have the potential to test integration models and improve our understanding of the inception of a continental-scale river system. In addition, timing and magnitude of regional uplift could be estimated if 5-6 Ma paleoelevation of any part of the system can be confidently identified (e.g. paleo sea level).\nPresent data indicate that downward integration occurred in part through a series of lake basins that filled and spilled as fluvial-deltaic sediments prograded towards the Gulf of California. However, a possible marine connection and hence a near sea-level elevation for the lower Blythe basin of the Bouse Fm remains controversial. Non-marine Sr signatures in lower Bouse Fm carbonates are permissibly consistent with mixing in an estuary and conversely, limited assemblages of marine fossils are permissively explained by avian transport to inland saline lakes. Improved geochronology has the potential to discriminate between a < 100 ka episode of downward integration of short-lived lakes from a > 1 Ma longer-lived estuarine system. Improved geochronology can also help resolve controversy about the timing of the arrival of Colorado River sediment and water in each basin and, in particular in the Salton Trough.\nWe present initial U/Pb results on Hualapai Limestone and Bouse Fm carbonates. Hualapai samples give linear 3D isochron ages of 9.3 ± 1.1 and 10.4 ± 3.1 Ma that are consistent with available stratigraphic controls. Preliminary attempts to date Bouse marl have so far yielded imprecise results. However generally high U/Pb ratios and U concentrations in Bouse samples are promising. Efforts are currently underway to date fine-grained banded Bouse tufas from lake margins.",

            "abstract": "Resolving subduction zones in the shallow upper mantle using global shear velocity tomography has long been a challenge, likely due to the rather narrow signature of the slabs down to ~400 km depth compared to the wavelength of fundamental mode and overtone surface waves, on which resolution of Vs at these depths often relies. On the other hand, models based on P wave travel times exhibit higher resolution in subduction zone regions, owing to both the higher frequencies of the P waves as well as an optimal illumination geometry. Conversely, the global Vs models typically have better resolution near the CMB, because of constraints provided by Sdiff and multiple ScS phases. Here we compare the morphology of subducted slabs throughout the mantle, as imaged by both a recent Vp model (GAP_P4, Fukao and Obayashi, 2013) and a new Vs model (SEMUCB-WM1, French and Romanowicz, GJI, in revision). The latter model was developed by inverting body (to 32s) and fundamental and overtone surface (to 60s) waveforms, with the forward seismic wavefield computed using the spectral element method. While the S velocity model is still \"fuzzier\" than the Vp model, it tracks the behavior of slabs trapped in the transition zone, and those ponding around 1000 km depth. We quantify the high correlation of the region of fast Vp and Vs anomalies, and thus derive a robust estimate of the R=dlnVs/dlnVp ratio as a function of depth in regions of faster than average velocity. We compare these results with estimates obtained with other combinations of available P and S models, as well as theoretical values from mineral physical calculations. Estimating R in slow velocity regions is more difficult, as resolution varies more among models. Here we compare slow velocity images in SEMUCB-WM1 with those of other recent Vs and Vp models and attempt to estimate R in those regions as well. Interestingly, we note that, in the SEMUCB-WM1 model, some of the columnar, lower than average velocity regions \"rising\" from the CMB through the lower mantle appear to be deflected horizontally at ~1000 km depth. This observation suggests that whatever mechanism causes the resistance to downward flow in subduction zones at this depth may also affect upwellings.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of slow slip events (SSEs) at subduction margins is critical to our understanding of seismic and aseismic fault behavior in these regions. The Hikurangi subduction margin adjacent to the North Island, New Zealand, provides an ideal natural laboratory to study SSEs, since both shallow and deep SSEs are observed there, and they are also correlated with the locking behavior, which varies from south to north. In our initial work, we included the effects of material property variations using a New-Zealand-wide seismic velocity model (Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2010), as well as an improved interface geometry (Williams et al., 2013), to provide improved slip estimates for portions of two SSEs: the Manawatu event from September - December, 2010, and the Kapiti event from January - July, 2013.\nWe have now improved our original technique, in which we use the finite element code PyLith (Aagaard et al., 2013) to generate Green’s functions using material properties from the seismic velocity model, and then use these Green’s functions in the DEFNODE inversion program (McCaffrey, 1995; 2002). Using our improved method, we re-examine a number of Hikurangi SSEs to provide revised slip estimates. We find that the inclusion of the more realistic material properties reduces the estimated slip by approximately one third, in comparison to models assuming a uniform elastic half-space. This highlights the necessity to account for realistic physical property variations of the crust in studies of slow slip—accounting for this can greatly impact the estimated slip budget accommodated by SSEs at subduction zones, as well as the equivalent moment magnitude of SSEs. In addition, we have developed an alternative inversion code that we apply to the same SSEs. By doing this, we are able to estimate the sensitivity of our results to: 1) Assumed interface geometry, 2) Variations in elastic structure, and 3) Inversion technique. By quantifying the sensitivity of our solution to these effects, we should be able to provide much more robust slip estimates for SSEs at the Hikurangi margin and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "We have developed an updated Version 4 (V4) polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) data set from 35 years of SBUV measurements. The detection threshold has been revised to better represent the expected variation of PMC brightness with scattering angle. We now recommend the use of 273 nm directional albedo values to reduce uncertainties associated with instrument noise. We present our analysis of the V4 PMC data set in terms of ice water content (IWC), using a parameterization of regression results from a microphysical model to determine IWC from observed albedo. While we derive a local time adjustment as a function of IWC in order to use all SBUV measurements, we also find that our long-term trend analysis is insensitive to the nature of this function.\nIn contrast to our earlier published work assuming a linear long-term trend of the SBUV time series, our new multiple linear regression results indicate that the anti-correlated response to solar activity and the increasing trend were both stronger in the first part of our data record (through ~1996) compared to the latter part. The use of a two-part linear trend for this analysis provides a long-term forcing similar to observed variations in upper stratospheric ozone and lower stratospheric temperature, as suggested earlier by Lübken et al [2011]. The fraction of total variance in the IWC time series explained by the multiple regression model is significantly smaller for all Southern Hemisphere latitudes compared to the corresponding Northern Hemisphere latitude. This suggests that interannual variability (not captured by our simple model) plays a larger role in the Southern Hemisphere. Possible explanations for the mid-1990’s ‘break’ in the long-term record are offered.\nLübken, F.‐J., and U.

            "abstract": "The NSF-MARGINS Program funded a decade of research on continental margin processes, organized around four initiatives: (1) chemical cycling in subduction zones (SubFac), (2) seismogenic zone processes at subduction zones (SEIZE), (3) rupturing continental lithosphere (RCL), and (4) source to sink sediment cycling at continental margins (S2S). The outcomes of this research provided critical new observations and insights into fundamental geologic processes along continental margins, and associated geologic hazards and economic resources. The transition to the successor GeoPRISMS Program provided a unique opportunity to identify and synthesize the highlights of MARGINS research, and to disseminate this knowledge to educators and students who will carry out the next phase of cutting-edge scientific research. The NSF TUES Program funded a two-year project entitled: “Bringing NSF MARGINS Continental Margins Research into the Undergraduate Curriculum,“ enabling development of ~15 mini-lessons drawing on key MARGINS results and data sets. The mini-lesson development team consists of 18 educators and scientists, grouped by initiative, and guided by experts in MARGINS science and current educational research and practices. Webinars and virtual check-ins enable team interactions and exchange of ideas and experiences; in person workshops solidified pedagogical approaches and assessment strategies, as well as initiative frameworks for the mini-lessons. Field testing by team members and outside volunteers during AY 2013-14 identified challenges and opportunities, guiding mini-lesson revision and finalization. The MARGINS mini-lessons define coordinated, data-rich educational resources, easy to access and free to the public, ready to be incorporated into multiple common geoscience course frameworks, taking the first step toward building a community of practice of scientists and curriculum specialists with the shared goal of moving cutting-edge science into undergraduate classrooms.

In June 2014, we initiated deep soil heating to test the responsiveness of deep peat carbon stocks, microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling processes to heating at 4 warming levels (+2.25, +4.5, +6.75 and +9 °C; 2 replicate plots) compared to fully-constructed control plots (+0 °C; 2 replicate plots). The warming treatments were deployed over eight 113 m2 areas using circular arrays of low-wattage (W) electrical resistance heaters. Perimeter heating was achieved by an exterior circle of 48 100W heaters that apply heat from the surface to a depth of 3 meters. Heating within the study area was accomplished utilizing three zones of 100W “deep only” heaters: an intermediate circle of 12 units, an interior circle of 6 units and one unit placed at the plot center. Heating elements inside the study area apply heat only from -2 to -3 m to keep active heater surfaces away from measured peat volumes. With an average peat depth of 2.5 meters this system was able to warm approximately 113 of the 282 m3 of peat within each target plot. In the absence of the air warming cap, in situ deep peat heating is only effective at sustaining warming in the deep peat layers. Warming levels at depth were achieved over a 25-day (+ 2.25 °C) to a 60-day (+9 °C) period depending on the target treatment temperatures in agreement with a priori energy balance model simulations. Homogeneous temperature distributions between heaters at a given depth interval continued to develop after these targets were reached. Biological and biogeochemical responses to these manipulations are being actively assessed. After one month of transient heating, data for ground-level surface flux of CO2 and CH4 had not shown changes from deep peat heating, but they continue to be tracked and will be summarized in this and related talks.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) is a mid- and far-infrared thermal emission radiometer on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). It measures radiances in limb and on-planet viewing geometries. From these radiance measurements, profiles of atmospheric temperature, dust and water ice are operationally retrieved from the surface to ~80 km altitude with a vertical resolution of ~5 km.\nWhile limb geometry provides superior vertical resolution over sounding in nadir geometry, it leads to significant horizontal averaging along the line-of-sight. This can lead to misrepresentations in the retrieved quantities in the presence of significant horizontal gradients of these quantities, if the retrieval assumes spherical symmetry. In MCS retrievals, this effect is particularly important in the polar winter regions due to the strong latitudinal gradients in atmospheric temperature. It leads to an apparent shift of the cold pole of the polar vortex away from the viewing direction of the instrument. The assumption of spherical symmetry can lead to misrepresentations of several K in temperature at a given latitude.\nHere we present an approach to consider these horizontal gradients by applying a two-dimensional radiative transfer scheme to the MCS retrieval. In a first pass a retrieval with the assumption of spherical symmetry is performed. From these retrieval results, horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, dust and water ice are determined for all measurements along an MRO orbit. These gradient fields are then imposed on a second pass of the retrieval using a two-dimensional radiative transfer scheme. We show that the approach reduces misrepresentations in the retrieved temperature to typically less than 1-2 K in the wall of the polar vortex. Application of this approach to the operational MCS retrieval will lead to a significant improvement in the quality of the retrieved parameters, in particular of temperature in the winter polar regions, which have emerged as a focus of recent scientific interest.",

            "abstract": "Critical Coulomb wedge theory established that orogenic and accretionary wedges should develop self-similarly and maintain a critical taper that reflects the balance of strength of the wedge material and a basal décollement. However, a variety of geological processes can perturb that balance, forcing readjustment of the wedge. For example, glacial erosion and landsliding can concentrate erosion on a localized portion of the wedge slope, leaving that portion of the wedge with an out-of-equilibrium slope that would need to re-develop for the wedge to resume self-similar growth. We use the discrete element method to analyze how growing bivergent wedges with different cohesive strengths respond structurally and mechanically to erosional events localized along upper, middle, and lower segments of the pro-wedge. Mechanically, pro-wedge erosion results in a sudden decrease followed by a quick recovery of the mean stress and maximum shear stress throughout the pro-wedge. However, when erosion is localized in the mid- to lower portions of the pro-wedge, a zone of increased mean stress develops where the wedge is concentrating deformation to recover its taper. In contrast, when erosion is localized in the upper axial zone, there is almost no recovery of the wedge taper, reflecting the fact that the material at the top of the wedge is being carried passively in a transition zone between the pro-wedge and retro-wedge. Structurally, wedges composed of lower cohesion material recover their critical taper almost immediately through distributed deformation, while wedges of higher-cohesion material recover more slowly, and incompletely, by concentrating deformation along existing fault surfaces. As a result, localized erosional episodes can have a lasting effect on the wedge morphology when the wedge is composed of higher cohesion material.",

It is shown these exchanges, especially the Evapo-transpiration (ETR), primarily rely on surface soil moisture at annual time scales because of the seasonal cycle of the West African monsoon and the corresponding precipitation. However, at finer time scales, soil moisture dependencies are much more complex and no simple relation exists between ETR and soil moisture, especially when vegetation has developed. If the presence of adequate soil moisture is a prerequisite for any ETR rate, the interactions between all surface processes render the use of simple models inadequate.\nSeveral illustrations will be presented based on data analysis and ALMIP experiments. One of them concerns the surface model response at daily time step after a rain event. It is shown that, for all the experimental sites, the immediate surface response is mainly dependent on the soil moisture content especially for bare soil conditions. The ALMIP model ensemble broadly reproduce the ETR annual cycle but depicts a broad range of relationships between Evaporative Fraction and soil moisture, with the worst results for the driest sites.\nThe second illustration concerns a comparison of local modelling results with in situ data. It is shown that the CLM model parameterisations are able to reproduce surface conductances. For bare soil conditions, the soil moisture dependency follows the Sakagushi law. During the vegetated period (over fallow), the evaporation rate is no longer controlled by soil moisture but by the radiative budget of the canopy and the amount of energy that reaches the ground. Finally, the Ball & Berry conductance model is able to reproduce transpiration rate reasonably well. This model is a function of incoming radiation and soil moisture, but also leaf temperature which impacts all of the surface energy exchanges.",

            "abstract": "Persistent societal interest in improving water quality and recovering imperiled, native, aquatic species has expanded the scope of stream restoration to include the hyporheic zone as a focus. Despite the lack of detailed studies, hyporheic restoration is often invoked as a means to achieve multiple objectives including moderation of water temperature, delay of seasonal flows and increasing the localized volume of floodplain water. We present interim results from an ongoing case study that monitors the changes as a result of stream restoration of the hyporheic zone of a 4th order, alluvial floodplain in northeast Oregon, USA, Meacham Creek. Active and passive restoration of 2.5 km of Meacham Creek has altered the creek from a single-threaded, incised and bedrock-dominated channel to a perched, alluvial channel that seasonally exchanges overbank flows with the surrounding floodplain. Our results suggest that the stream restoration effort on Meacham Creek has increased the volume of annual hyporheic storage and created a more diverse distribution of flowpath lengths within the restoration site. Furthermore, our monitoring indicates that hyporheic process response to stream restoration, analogous to other geomorphic processes, conforms to a systematic hierarchy where nested flow paths range in length and residence time from meters and hours at the habitat scale to tens of meters and months at the floodplain scale. We assert that scale-explicit and measurement-focused restoration planning has a greater likelihood of meeting the stated objectives and result in improved water quality and encourage recovery of many native aquatic species.",

            "abstract": "Chondrites are considered as the building rocks of the Earth as they represent remnants of the protoplanetary accretion stage. Among all chondritic classes, heavy noble gases are mainly concentrated in phase Q [1] hence it represents a likely primordial composition of the Earth. This is supported by the observation of [2] who detected this peculiar composition in CO2 well gases thanks to Kr isotopes. As CO2 well gases are supposed to derive from the same reservoir as MORBs [3], this signature should be observed in MORBs and OIBs as well. In this perspective, we will present analyses performed by mass spectrometry of MORBs and OIBs samples for all noble gases. Preliminary results are quite promising as the same trend seems to appear into OIB and MORB data for Kr isotopes.\nHowever, our analyses show that this primordial composition isn’t displayed for stable isotopes of Xe as already observed by [4-5] and remains a trace in the mantle signature, which appears at first sight atmospheric. We thus propose that subduction of atmospheric noble gases has gradually covered this meteoritic imprint. In order to test this scenario, we will present a modelling performed for Ar and Xe in three distinct reservoirs: mantle, atmosphere and continental crust. The mantle is considered as homogenized by convection and similar to the MORB reservoir. Its degasing is divided in two stages: a massive early degasing followed by a decreasing one describing the cooling of the Earth’s interior. Extraction of parent elements from the mantle to the continental crust is also taken into account as well as distillation of atmospheric Xe needed to explain the missing Xe paradox and the present Xe isotopic signature of the atmosphere. Finally, subduction of noble gases is assimilated to simple incorporation into the mantle of elementally fractionated air, enriched in heavy noble gases as supported by [6]. Thus, we show that starting with a chondritic composition, the present mantle composition can be reproduced and that subduction plays a major role as it explains the nearly atmospheric signature of the mantle for Xe stable isotopes and considerably lowers the radiogenic isotopic ratios.\n[1] Huss et al., GCA (1996) [2] Holland et al., Sci.

            "abstract": "A fundamental and a comprehensive understanding of trapping and leakage processes will be of value to develop strategies for efficient and secure storage of CO2 in deep geologic formations and assess environmental and ecological risks associated with potential leakage. It is our contention that to make observations and collect data to obtain a fundamental understanding of how the natural formation heterogeneity manifested at all scales affects trapping is highly challenging or impossible to obtain in real field settings in deep geologic formations. A test scale intermediary between small laboratory columns and field scales that is referred to as “intermediate scale” provides an attractive alternative to investigate these processes under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Heterogeneities at all needed test scales can be designed using soils with known properties and experiments can be conducted under controlled conditions to obtain accurate data. Conducting intermediate scale laboratory experiments under ambient pressure and temperature conditions to understand the processes that occur in deep formations with very higher pressures and drastically different temperatures pose many challenges. This paper presents the approaches that were used to conduct multi-scale experiments from column to intermediate scale to understand the factors that contribute to capillary and dissolution trapping using surrogate fluids for supercritical CO2 and saline water combination. In addition, experiments were conducted in soil columns and two-dimensional tanks to study the effects of formation heterogeneity on CO2 gas evolution during leakage of water with dissolved CO2. The results from these experiments are presented to show how the new insights have helped to improve the conceptual understanding of effects of heterogeneity on CO2 trapping and leakage. This understanding has helped to improve numerical models that can be used to better engineer CO2 storage systems for permanence and evaluate possible failure risks.",

DART provides a comprehensive suite of software, documentation, examples and tutorials that can be used for ensemble data assimilation research, operations, and education. Scientists and software engineers from the Data Assimilation Research Section at NCAR are available to actively support DART users who want to use existing DART products or develop their own new applications. Current DART users range from university professors teaching data assimilation, to individual graduate students working with simple models, through national laboratories doing operational prediction with large state-of-the-art models. DART runs efficiently on many computational platforms ranging from laptops through thousands of cores on the newest supercomputers.\nThis poster focuses on several recent research activities using DART with geophysical models. First, DART is being used with the Community Atmosphere Model Spectral Element (CAM-SE) and Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) global atmospheric models that support locally enhanced grid resolution. Initial results from ensemble assimilation with both models are presented. DART is also being used to produce ensemble analyses of atmospheric tracers, in particular CO, in both the global CAM-Chem model and the regional Weather Research and Forecast with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model by assimilating observations from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments. Results from ensemble analyses in both models are presented. An interface between DART and the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model has been completed and ensemble land surface analyses with DART/CABLE will be discussed. Finally, an update on ensemble analyses in the fully-coupled Community Earth System (CESM) is presented. The poster includes instructions on how to get started using DART for research or educational applications.",

            "abstract": "Plant macrofossils from packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens provide evidence of vegetation changes that have been used to infer aspects of differences between modern and past climates in the southwestern United States (the \"Southwest\"). This is a dry region of complex physiography with sharp elevational changes resulting in diverse microclimates over short distances.\nAlthough it is a relatively straightforward process to obtain quantitative estimates from plant macrofossil assemblages, it can be difficult to assess associated uncertainties. For the Southwest we evaluated aspects of potential uncertainties by comparing observed climates with estimates based on modern midden assemblages, and on virtual assemblages from gridded modern plant distribution data. We compared anomalies (estimated minus observed values) produced by four quantitative estimation approaches for winter temperature, summer temperature, and annual precipitation; presenting these results as correlations, average absolute anomalies, and the degrees of bias. In addition, we assessed the influences on anomalies of: 1) the number of taxa in an assemblage, and 2) the geographic, elevational, and vegetational context of the assemblages. \nOur findings indicate that much of uncertainty in climatic estimates is related to how modern climate is depicted and how it is then estimated at individual locations. Important issues here include: what time span in the historic record is selected to represent interannual and interdecadal variability, and how is climate interpolated to a specific location. Other results include: 1) modern assemblages with relatively few plant taxa provide estimates with larger anomalies and more bias; and, 2) none of the approaches can accurately estimate true extreme values in the climate data. Overall, as a very rough guide, the range of uncertainty for climate estimates from modern plant assemblages is ± 2°C for temperature, and ± 50mm for annual precipitation. Climatic estimates from Holocene middens largely fall within these bands of uncertainly, whereas those from the Last Glacial Maximum exceed these bands and are colder and generally wetter than today.",

            "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are being aggressively deployed at residential, commercial, and utility scales to complement power generation from conventional sources. This is motivated both by the desire to reduce carbon footprints and by policy-driven financial incentives. Although several life cycle analyses (LCA) have investigated environmental impacts and energy payback times of solar PV systems, most results are based on hypothetical systems rather than actual, deployed systems that can provide measured performance data. Over the past five years, Desert Research Institute (DRI) in Nevada has installed eight solar PV systems of scales from 3 to 1000 kW, the sum of which supply approximately 40% of the total power use at DRI’s Reno and Las Vegas campuses.\nThe goal of this work is to explore greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts and examine the economic performance of DRI’s PV systems by developing and applying a comprehensive LCA and techno-economic (TEA) model. This model is built using data appropriate for each type of panel used in the DRI systems. Power output is modeled using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) model PVWatts. The performance of PVWatts is verified by the actual measurements from DRI’s PV systems. Several environmental and economic metrics are quantified for the DRI systems, including life cycle GHG emissions and energy return. GHG results are compared with Nevada grid-based electricity.\nInitial results indicate that DRI’s solar-derived electricity offers clear GHG benefits compared to conventional grid electricity. DRI’s eight systems have GHG intensity values of 29-56 gCO2e/kWh, as compared to the GHG intensity of 212 gCO2e/kWh of national average grid power. The major source of impacts (82-92% of the total) is the upstream life cycle burden of manufacturing PV panels, which are made of either mono-crystalline or multi-crystalline silicon. Given the same type of PV panel, GHG intensity decreases as the scale of the system increases. Energy payback times of DRI’s solar PV systems range from 0.5 to 1.5 years. The cost payback time for the DRI PV systems and the cost per ton of CO2 avoided by replacing Nevada-specific electrical power will be determined. The sensitivity of these environmental and economic impacts with respect to specific model parameters is being investigated.",

            "abstract": "HCFC-22 (CHClF2) and HFC-134a (CH2FCF3) are two major gases currently used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration and air conditioning. HCFC-22 contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion and both species are potent greenhouse gases, and their global emissions continue to rise at the present. In this work, we study aircraft based in-situ observations of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a over the Pacific Ocean in a three-year span (HIaper Pole-to-Pole Observation of carbon cycle and greenhouse gases study, HIPPO 2009-2011) and combine these data with long-term observations from global surface sites (NOAA and AGAGE networks). We find a steady increase in global annual emissions of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a for the past two decades (on average 3% and 4% per year, respectively). Emissions of HFC-134a since 2000 are consistently higher, with 60% more in recent years (2009-2011), compared to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory. Using both HIPPO and surface data, we quantify and verify enhanced summertime emissions of HFC-134a and HCFC-22 that are about three times those in the wintertime. This unforeseen large seasonal contribution indicates unaccounted mechanisms controlling refrigerant gas emissions, missing in the existing inventory estimates. Possible mechanisms for greater refrigerant leakages in the summer are: 1) higher vapor pressure in the sealed compartment of the system at summer high temperatures (saturated vapor pressure is ~ 3 times at 303 K compared to that at 273 K for both species), and 2) more frequent use of refrigeration and air conditioners in the summer (vapor pressure in the compressor line is higher when in use than not in use). Our results suggest that the engineering of the refrigeration and air conditioning systems can greatly influence the release of these two species to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic measurements of sulfate and sulfide phases preserved in carbonates document secular changes in the sulfur cycle and help shape our understanding of the redox evolution of Earth’s surface over geologic time. However, as the isotopic record of ancient oceanic conditions becomes better resolved, reports of coeval but discordant geochemical/isotopic proxies are becoming increasingly common. Such varied data could arise from (i) primary differences in the chemistry of the water column from which these sediments were deposited; (ii) geochemical alteration during physical reworking as sediments are being deposited; or (iii) as the result of secondary alteration of geochemical signals after deposition and lithification. As a bulk-rock proxy, d34S signals can consist of multiple origins of sulfate and sulfide within carbonate minerals. Deciphering these phases is critical in order to extract meaningful information about the depositional and diagenetic environment in which the samples formed.\nHere, we use X-ray spectromicroscopy to map the distribution of primary and secondary S-bearing sedimentary phases at the micron-scale in a well-characterized suite of Ordovician-aged (∼444 million years ago) carbonate strata from Anticosti Island, Quebec. The high-resolution maps of sulfate variability show differences between major phases (e.g., clasts vs. cement), as well as subtle differences in sulfate concentrations between fossil clades (e.g., crinoids vs. gastropods). Further, we can distinguish the sulfate content of different stages of calcite cement, helping to constrain the diagenetic history and relate specific cements with the chemistry of the waters from which they formed. In conjunction with secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) δ34S measurements, this work can distinguish isotopic signatures between primary and diagenetic phases, enhancing our ability to reconstruct biogeochemical sulfur cycling over Earth history using δ34S isotopic signatures.",

            "abstract": "Due to the diminishing availability of good quality water for irrigation, it is increasingly important that irrigation and salinity management tools be able to target submaximal crop yields and support the use of marginal quality waters. In this work, we present a steady-state irrigated systems modeling framework that accounts for reduced plant water uptake due to root zone salinity. Two new explicit, closed-form analytical solutions for the root zone solute concentration profile are obtained, corresponding to two alternative functional forms of the uptake reduction function. The solutions express a general relationship between irrigation water salinity, irrigation rate, crop salt tolerance, crop transpiration, and (using standard approximations) crop yield. Example applications are illustrated, including the calculation of irrigation requirements for obtaining targeted submaximal yields, and the generation of crop-water production functions for varying irrigation waters, irrigation rates, and crops. Model predictions are shown to be mostly consistent with existing models and available experimental data. Yet the new solutions possess clear advantages over available alternatives, including: (i) the new solutions were derived from a complete physical-mathematical description of the system, rather than based on an ad hoc formulation; (ii) the new analytical solutions are explicit and can be evaluated without iterative techniques; (iii) the solutions permit consideration of two common functional forms of salinity induced reductions in crop water uptake, rather than being tied to one particular representation; and (iv) the utilized modeling framework is compatible with leading transient-state numerical models.",

            "abstract": "Pollen-based vegetation reconstructions are the primary source of information about spatio-temporal trends in vegetation dynamics at timescales of centuries to millennia. Pollen samples from individual lakes, bogs, and small hollows provide information about the vegetation within their respective source areas, which when mapped together generate vegetation reconstructions across spatial and temporal scales. Climate histories also can be reconstructed using empirical taxa-climate relationships. A fundamental need in these reconstructions is to estimate the pollen source area and account for the effects of intertaxonomic differences in pollen production and dispersal. Mechanistic pollen-vegetation models have continuously evolved for nearly a century, with recent advances culminating in the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm. However, most applications of the LRA do not account for anisotropies in pollen source area introduced by atmospheric variations.\nGiven that wind direction is often anisotropic and variable we investigate the effects of wind speed, wind direction, and a simple treatment of wet versus dry deposition on vegetation reconstruction from pollen. We obtained long term estimates of dominant wind patterns using North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) weather data for 1979-2012. However, because contemporary vegetation and pollen distributions have been heavily affected by Euro-American land use, we use pre-settlement (ca. 1810-1904) forest composition across the prairie-forest ecotone in the upper Midwestern United States and a dataset of settlement-era pollen samples compiled by the PalEON project to model pollen-vegetation relationships. Comparisons of our modelled results with those of a unidirectional, homogenous model shows a substantial effect of regionally varying winds on vegetation reconstructions. In addition to variable wind speed and direction, other atmospheric effects including precipitation and instability play an important role in pollen transport and deposition. By better accounting for these effects we can improve the predictive capacity of pollen-vegetation models and reduce uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon (C) cycling can slow or accelerate in response to new C inputs from fresh organic matter. This change in native C mineralization, known as the “microbial priming effect,” is difficult to predict because the underlying mechanisms of priming are still poorly understood. We hypothesized that soil mineral assemblage, specifically short-range-order (SRO) minerals, influences microbial responses to different quality C substrate inputs. To test this, we added 350 μg C g-1soil weekly of an artificial root exudates mixture primarily comprised of glucose, sucrose, lactate and fructose (a simple C source) or ground ponderosa pine litter (a complex C source) for six weeks to three soil types from similar ecosystems derived from different parent material. The soils, from andesite, basalt, and granite parent materials, had decreasing abundance in SRO minerals, respectively. We found that the simple C substrate induced 63 ±16.3% greater positive priming than the complex C across all soil types. The quantity of soil SRO materials was negatively correlated with soil respiration, but positively correlated with priming. The lowest SRO soil amended with litter primed the least (14 ± 11 μgCO2-C g-1), while the largest priming effect occurring in the highest SRO soil amended with simple substrate (246 ± 18 μgCO2-C g-1). Our results indicate that higher SRO mineral content could accelerate microorganisms’ capacity to mineralize native soil organic carbon and respond more strongly to labile C inputs. However, while all treatments exhibited positive priming, the amount of C added over the six-week incubation was greater than total CO2 respired. This suggests that despite a relative stimulation of native C mineralization, these soils act as C sinks rather than sources in response to fresh organic matter inputs.",

            "abstract": "EarthScope’s Education and Outreach (E&O) program aims to increase public awareness of Earth science and enhance geoscience education at the K-12 and college level. The program is distinctive among major geoscience programs in two ways. First, planning for education and public engagement occurred in tandem with planning for the science mission. Second, the NSF EarthScope program includes funding support for education and outreach. In this presentation, we highlight key examples of the program’s accomplishments and identify emerging E&O opportunities.\nE&O efforts have been collaboratively led by the EarthScope National Office (ESNO), IRIS, UNAVCO, the EarthScope Education and Outreach Subcommittee (EEOSC) and PI-driven EarthScope projects. Efforts by the EEOSC, guided by an EarthScope Education and Outreach Implementation Plan that is periodically updated, focus EarthScope E&O. EarthScope demonstrated early success in engaging undergraduate students (and teachers) in its mission through their involvement in siting USArray across the contiguous U.S. Funded E&O programs such as TOTLE, Illinois EarthScope, CEETEP (for K-12), InTeGrate and GETSI (for undergraduates) foster use of freely available EarthScope data and research findings.\nThe Next Generation Science Standards, which stress science and engineering practices, offer an opportunity for alignment with existing EarthScope K-12 educational resources, and the EEOSC recommends focusing efforts on this task.\nThe EEOSC recognizes the rapidly growing use of mobile smart devices by the public and in formal classrooms, which bring new opportunities to connect with the public and students. This will capitalize on EarthScope’s already prominent social media presence, an effort that developed to accomplish one of the primary goals of the EarthScope E&O Implementation Plan to “Create a high-profile public identity for EarthScope” and to “Promote science literacy and understanding of EarthScope among all audiences through informal education venues” Leveraging ESNO, IRIS, and UNAVCO resources has exceeded the capabilities of any single entity, thereby amplifying the impact of EarthScope’s education and outreach effort.",

            "abstract": "The Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), occurring roughly 52 million years ago, represents an Earth system response to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and potentially serves as an analog for the Earth system response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the next several centuries. During EECO, global temperatures were 12-15 ºC warmer than modern, with the majority of warming occurring at high latitudes, effectively reducing the Earth’s latitudinal temperature gradient. Despite a wealth of studies, there remain discrepancies between proxy records and global climate models as to the magnitude of this reduction in temperature gradients. In particular, proxy records of isotopes in precipitation appear to indicate shallower temperature gradients than models are able to simulate; however, many of these studies utilize empirical relationships between precipitation isotopes and temperature gradients that likely do not hold under different climate regimes. Here we present 5 new proxy records of EECO precipitation isotopes from British Columbia (BC), Canada spanning 49 – 55 ºN, a crucial latitudinal gap in existing records. We observe similar to slightly increasing δ18O values with increasing latitude, likely representative of a topographic highland in southern BC with decreasing elevations to the north. We incorporate this new data into a global compilation of proxy records of precipitation isotopes and compare these to a one dimensional, isotope-enabled mechanistic model of latitudinal water vapor transport. Using this model, we test the sensitivity of latitudinal isotopic gradients to varying latitudinal temperature gradients, mid-latitude eddy strengths, and latitudinal extents of vapor recharge zones via surface ocean evaporation. Finally, we analyze the implications for pole-ward latent heat transport in a high-CO2, globally warmer climate.",

Most, if not all, of these eruptions have in common the paradoxical coexistence of (1) eruptive styles which are inferred to be sustained in nature (subplinian and plinian), with (2) a pulsatory behavior displayed by the resulting fall deposits, and (3) the coeval ejection of vesicular tephra and pyroclastic obsidian. Through two case studies, we explore this apparent set of paradoxes, and their significance in understanding transitions from explosive to effusive behavior.\nIn this first case study (also cf. Leonhardi et al., same session), we present a new detailed stratigraphy of the AD1100 Big Glass Mountain eruption (Medicine Lake Volcano), along with a series of density measurements of tephra collected from several key units identified in the proximal fall deposits. The geochemical character of pumice and obsidian clasts from both the tephra and the obsidian flow is used to trace the origins of the different lithologies involved. We find that tens of waxing and waning cycles occurred during this eruption with at least two protracted phases, and that perhaps the term (sub)plinian may not be completely adequate to describe this particular eruption style. We also review models for the formation of juvenile pyroclastic obsidian in the context of rhyolitic eruptions.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the phenomenon of asymmetric alluvial fan morphology along strike-slip faults. From analysis of high-resolution topographic data, we find that asymmetric alluvial fans are common along several strike-slip faults in the western United States. Affected fans are steeper in the direction of translation of the sediment source, often resulting in stream deflections counter to that expected from the sense of fault slip (e.g. left deflected streams along dextral faults). We hypothesize that fan asymmetry results from lateral translation of the sediment source relative to the depocenter. This relative motion changes the accommodation space in such a way that one side of the alluvial fan continuously progrades while the other is gradually abandoned. Therefore, lateral translation results in radial asymmetry of slopes about the fan apex. As a first approximation, we model this asymmetry as a result of diffusive sediment transport down fan. From this analysis, we predict that the degree of asymmetry of the alluvial fan is controlled by the ratio of sediment flux to fault slip rate. Qualitatively, more rapidly slipping faults should host more highly asymmetric fans; conversely, high sediment flux will obscure asymmetry. By measuring the sediment flux, through catchment-average concentration of cosmogenic isotopes or other means, we show that it is theoretically possible to quantify strike-slip fault slip-rates and alluvial-fan sediment transport rates using alluvial fan morphometry.",

            "abstract": "Beno Gutenberg first identified a seismic low velocity zone in the upper mantle that we now refer to as the asthenosphere that is still the focus of many studies in active tectonic regions. The upper-most mantle is very heterogeneous and occupies the depth range where much of the tectonic action occurs especially in subduction zones and convergent margins. The central South American convergent margin is the result of the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate and includes the Andes, one of the largest actively growing mountain ranges on Earth. The South American subduction zone has two regions of “flat” subduction in Peru and central Chile and Argentina separated by a segment of “normal” subduction and an active magmatic arc. The central Andean plateau has an average elevation of 3-4 km and some of the thickest crust on Earth with deformation reaching ~800 km inland. This active margin is characterized by along-strike variations in magmatism, upper crustal shortening, crustal thickness, and slab geometry that make it an ideal region to study the relationship between the subducting slab, the mantle wedge, and the overriding plate. After 20 years of portable seismic deployments in the Central Andes seismologists have generated unprecedented seismic images spanning ~3000 km of the Andean lithosphere, the subducting Nazca slab, and the surrounding mantle. Seismic travel-time, ambient noise and earthquake surface-wave tomography, receiver function imaging, and joint receiver function - surface wave dispersion inversions have produced along strike images of the Central Andes from the surface to a depth of ~700 km. These new images were made possible by PI-driven portable broadband seismic deployments and data sharing by many international groups. I will highlight images of along-strike variations in crustal properties and thickness, mantle lithospheric structure, and slab geometry. These seismic images allow us to more completely evaluate the role of several tectonic processes in the formation and uplift of the Andes including: (1) overthickened continental crust driven by crustal shortening, (2) changes in slab dip and coupling with the overlying plate (3) localized lithospheric foundering, and (4) large-scale mantle and crustal melting leading to magmatic addition and/or crustal flow.",

Polar Portal is a single web portal presenting a wide range of near real-time information on both the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic sea-ice in a format geared for non-specialists.\nPolar Portal aims to meet widespread public interest in a diverse range of climate-cryosphere processes in the Arctic: What is the present Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise? How quickly are outlet glaciers retreating or advancing right now? How extensive is Arctic sea-ice or how warm is the Arctic Ocean at this moment? Although public interest in such topics is widely acknowledged, an important primary task for the scientists behind Polar Portal was collaborating with media specialists to establish the knowledge range of the general public on these topics, in order for Polar Portal to appropriately present useful climate-cryosphere information. Consequently, Polar Portal is designed in a highly visual exploratory format, where individual data products are accompanied by plain written summaries, with hyperlinks to relevant journal papers for more scrutinizing users. Numerous satellite and in situ observations, together with model output, are channeled daily into the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic sea-ice divisions of Polar Portal.",

The internet-based system will provide an interface where the researchers will input data collected from the measurement stations and present them to the public in form of charts, tables, maps, and documents. Moreover, the system is developed in ASP.NET MVC 4 using as Database Management System, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, and hosted by Amazon Web Services. Currently the system is supporting the Mason Watershed Project providing historical hydrological, atmospheric and water quality data for the campus watershed and real time flood conditions in the campus. The system is also a gateway for unprecedented data collection of hurricane storm surge hydrodynamics in coastal wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay providing not only access to historical data but recent storms such as Hurricane Arthur. Future research includes coupling the system to a real-time flood alert system on campus, and besides providing data on the World Wide Web, to foment and provide a venue for interdisciplinary collaboration within the water scientists in the region.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes can provide considerable insight into enzymatic mechanisms and fluxes in various biological processes. In our studies, we used stable isotopes to characterize both enzyme-catalyzed H2 and N2O production. H2 is a potential alternative clean energy source and also a key metabolite in many microbial communities. Biological H2 production is generally catalyzed by hydrogenases, enzymes that combine protons and electrons to produce H2 under anaerobic conditions. In our study, H isotopes and fractionation factors (α) were used to characterize two types of hydrogenases: [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Due to differences in the active site, the α associated with H2 production for [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases separated into two distinct clusters (αFeFe > αNiFe). The calculated kinetic isotope effects indicate that hydrogenase-catalyzed H2 production has a preference for light isotopes, consistent with the relative bond strengths of O-H and H-H bonds. Interestingly, the isotope effects associated with H2 consumption and H2-H2O exchange reactions were also characterized, but in this case no specific difference was observed between the different enzymes.\nN2O is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 300 times that of CO2, and the concentration of N2O is currently increasing at a rate of ~0.25% per year. Thus far, bacterial and fungal denitrification processes have been identified as two of the major sources of biologically generated N2O. In this study, we measured the δ15N, δ18O, δ15Nα (central N atom in N2O), and δ15Nβ (terminal N atom in N2O) of N2O generated by purified fungal P450 nitric oxide reductase (P450nor) from Histoplasma capsulatum. We observed normal isotope effects for δ18O and δ15Nα, and inverse isotope effects for bulk δ15N (the average of Nα and Nβ) and δ15Nβ. The observed isotope effects have been used in conjunction with DFT calculations to provide important insight into the mechanism of P450nor. Similar experiments were performed with bacterial nitric oxide reductase from Paracoccus denitrificans (cNOR). In this case both Nα and Nβ exhibited inverse isotope effects, while O had a normal isotope effect. Together, these data highlight the utility in using stable isotopes as both tracers and mechanistic probes when studying metabolic processes.",

Based on this proposition, a point-based algorithm, called a homogenous locator (HL), has been developed to invert simultaneously the position (horizontal position and depth) and structural index (SI) of the magnetic sources that generate the total magnetic intensity (TMI) and its gradient and full tensor magnetic gradiometry (FTMG). The algorithm is then tested against point sources (pole and dipoles) and compared with standard Euler deconvolution (SED) using synthetic and field data sets. Cases with sole induction and remnant dipole moment are also investigated and compared. Results show that: (1) Both techniques can predict very accurately the horizontal positions and with less accuracy in depth prediction, but the homogenous locator has higher accuracy; (2) the homogenous locator can produce much few solutions on average for locating each magnetic object; (3) Since homogenous locator inverts SI simultaneously, clusters of SI around different centers can classify the source types accurately. This is a main advantage of the homogenous locator. While for each value of SI as an input to SED, magnetic sources of different types (pole and dipole) are all located, resulting in almost 100% of both commission and omission errors in classification of the types of sources; and (4) the homogenous locator is more sensitive to remnant than SED.",

            "abstract": "Absorbing boundary conditions are required for elastodynamic simulations in finite domains. The Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) have become the state-of-the-art method since its introduction (Berenger 1994). PML approaches have been proved to be very efficient and easy to implement. However, sometimes numerical instabilities originated in the PML layers can appear, even for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, it has been proven that PML have an amplifying behaviour, i.e. numerical instabilities (Becache et al. 2003). For delaying the appearance of these PML instabilities, different pragmatic approaches has been proposed (Meza-Fajarado & Papageorgiou 2008; Martin et al. 2008; Etienne et al. 2010). Yet, there are no guarantee for long-term stabilities and one can observe less efficient absorptions for these adhoc approaches. Recently, a new method, called SMART-layer method, has been proposed and has been shown theoretically to be stable even for anisotropic media (Halpern et al. 2011; Metivier et al. 2013). The SMART-layer method is a robust and simple to design method. However boundary conditions are not perfectly matched even for the continuous case for the SMART-layer method while it is for the PML method. Therefore, stronger reflections are observed at the interface between the domain of interest and the absorbing layers.. We implement this absorbing boundary conditions for the elastodynamics equations in a discontinuous Galerkin scheme and we will show that this numerical implementation does not exhibit numerical instabilities when using different mesh designs while the PML method does for the same simulation of wave propagation in isotropic medium. We finally show how SMART-layer method is competitive with respect to the PML method in terms of efficiency and computational cost, opening roads for systematic implementation of such absorbing boundary conditions in available seismic wave propagation tools.",

            "abstract": "Numerical investigations of surface deformation in response to flat slab subduction began with seminal papers by Bird (1988) and Mitrovica et al. (1989). Recently, a number of numerical studies have begun to explore the complexity in the dynamics of flat-slab subduction initiation and continuation, but did not address the corresponding surface deformation (English et al., 2003; Pérez-Campos et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2011; Arrial and Billen, 2013; Vogt and Gerya, 2014). Herein, we explore the conditions that lead to flat-slab subduction and characterize the resulting surface deformation using a 2D finite-difference marker-in-cell method. We specifically explore how initial model geometry and boundary conditions affect the evolution of the angle at which a slab subducts in the presence/absence of a buoyant oceanic plateau and the resulting surface topography. In our simulations, the surface is tracked through time as an internal erosion/sedimentation surface. The top boundary of the crust is overlaid by a “sticky” (viscous 10^17 Pa.s) water/air layer with correspondingly stratified densities. We apply a coupled surface processes model that solves the sediment transport/diffusion erosion equation at each time step to account for the corresponding crustal mass flux and its effect on crustal deformation. Model results show the initial angle of subduction has a substantial impact on the subduction angle of the slab and hence the evolution of topography. The results also indicate plate velocity and the presence of an oceanic plateau in a forced subduction only have a moderate effect on the angle of subduction.",

The two co-present plasmas were observed for four extended time periods, beginning shortly after the apparent passage of a magnetic cloud with indications of eroding magnetic structure on its sunward side. The observed phase-space distributions are shown to be unstable to several electromagnetic resonances, including the low-beta oblique Alfven II mode, heretofore not directly observed in nature. A spectral analysis of accompanying ion-gyroscale fluctuations in the magnetic field indicates ongoing exchange of energy between the plasma and the magnetized wave field through the local excitation of these modes. We hypothesize that the erosion of the magnetic cloud via reconnection with the trailing high-speed stream is the driver for this unusual observation, and that the de-excitation of beamed ion distributions such as this could be a typical dissipation path for large-scale magnetic reconnection outflows in the interplanetary plasma.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonic processes operating over much of the Earth’s history induce long-term mantle mixing of chemical heterogeneities, recycling of volatiles and regulate basalt geochemistry. Through broadband analysis of P-wave receiver function conversions and topside reflections, we characterize the 410 and 660 seismic discontinuities beneath China (see Shen et al., DI013, this meeting) and simultaneously determine the shear velocity and density jumps, the sharpness of the boundary as well as the gradient immediately above/below the boundary. Within the thermodynamic framework, HeFESTo, we explore these observations with respect to seismic properties predicted in a volatile/melt free mantle, where harzburgite and basalt rock assemblages are either fully equilibrated or mechanically mixed.\nWe find that observed shear velocity (5-6%) and density jumps (1.5-2%) across the 410 are both too low to be consistent with the olivine-wadsleyite phase transition in a pyrolitic mantle; the 410 is sharp (<< 5 km) and it requires Mg-rich harzburgite (Mg# >~ 0.93) in the mantle; the gradient near the 410 is very low, inconsistent with a dry pyrolitic mantle. The observed 660 not only consists of a sharp boundary (<< 5 km) with relatively small shear velocity (3.5-4%) and density jumps (4-4.5%), but it also involves a substantial velocity/density gradient near the boundary (> 0.003 km/s/km; > 0.003 g/cm3/km). These observations coincide very well with the post-spinel and post-garnet phase transitions in a mantle with about 75% harzburgite fully equilibrated with 25% basalt.\nTaking into account of previous mantle triplication analyses and electric conductivity profiles in the region, these results lead us to examine the following hypotheses: The harzburgite assemblage in the mantle transition zone beneath China is probably at least as depleted as Archean cratonic peridotites. Near the 410, the mantle is either relatively dry (e.g., the water content is well below the solubility of olivine) and basalt-enriched (~40%), or extremely wet (e.g., the water content is near or beyond wadsleyite saturation limit) and pyrolitic. While the 660 is consistent with a dry mantle in full equilibrium, we can’t rule out the possibility of a hydrated lower transition zone and uppermost lower mantle that is mechanically mixed.",

            "abstract": "The processes controlling cloud formation and evolution represent a significant uncertainty in models of global climate change. High altitude cirrus clouds contribute a large portion of this uncertainty due to their altitude and abundance. The mechanism behind the formation of cirrus clouds depends on the characteristics and composition of ice supersaturation (ISS) regions, regions where the relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) is greater than 100%. Small-scale dynamics have recently been shown to have a strong effect on the RHi of the UT/LS, and therefore on cirrus cloud formation. Until now, there has been insufficient data in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) to investigate these effects. The Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) was a series of campaigns focused on improving our understanding of humidity in the TTL. During this campaign, the NASA Langley/Ames Diode Laser Hygrometer was part of the payload on the NASA Global Hawk, resulting in measurements of humidity with as low as 1-2 m vertical resolution at altitudes up to 19 km. We will present observations from ATTREX describing the small scale spatial variability of water vapor along transects of ISSRs and cirrus clouds, as well as the dynamics driving the formation of ISS regions. These results will be discussed in context with results from prior UT/LS campaigns, such as DC3 and HIPPO.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation, we quantify several aspects of methane emissions in the US and Canada using concentration data collected in the atmosphere. First, how much methane in total is emitted from the US and Canada? Second, how much methane is emitted from each individual source across these countries? Third, and finally, how have each of these sources changed in magnitude over the past ten to twenty years? To answer these questions, we use a geostatistical model-data fusion framework and spatial data on land use and economic activity. Using this approach, we estimate the contribution of different source types to methane emissions in the US and compare the magnitude of those anthropogenic emissions against natural fluxes from major wetlands like those near Hudson Bay, Canada. Furthermore, we examine the time-evolution of methane concentrations over regions dominated by agriculture and natural gas extraction and investigate what this data indicates about changes in emissions over time.",

            "abstract": "Manifestations of supercritical water in magmatic environments have so far only been accessible from analogue outcrops of fossil systems and by simulating pressure/temperature conditions in the laboratory. In order to assess the unknown properties of such reservoirs, scientific drilling is used when Earth surface sampled rocks cannot sufficiently explain past geological processes and when geophysical imaging does not sufficiently explain observed phenomena. However, our understanding of structural and dynamic characteristics of geothermal systems can be improved through application of advanced and/or innovative exploration technologies. Unlike resistivity imaging, active and passive seismic techniques have rarely been used in volcanic geothermal areas, because processing techniques were not adapted to geothermal conditions. Recent advances in volcano-seismology have introduced new processing techniques for assessing subsurface structures and controls on fluid flow in geothermal systems. We present here preliminary analyses of seismic records around a geothermal reservoir located both on-land and offshore along the Reykjanes Ridge, SW-Iceland. We deployed on-land stations (20 broad-band and 10 short-period seismometers) and 24 Ocean Bottom Seismometers which are recording since April 2014. Together with existing permanent stations, the complete network comprises 66 stations. The network was designed so that several processing techniques can be used with the data set and address scientific questions concerning geothermal systems and the oceanic ridge. We present the network deployment, our approach and preliminary results from the first months.",

            "abstract": "Magnetized turbulent plasmas are generally characterized as weakly or strongly turbulent based on the relative strength of the linear and nonlinear terms on average. While this description is useful, it does not represent the full picture and can be misleading. We investigate the variation of the linear and nonlinear accelerations in the Fourier space of an MHD system with a mean magnetic field and broad selection of initial states and plasma parameters. We show that the local Fourier space ratios of nonlinear-to-linear accelerations can show significant departures from what is expected from the general global measure. We find that high cross helicity systems that are traditionally believed to be weakly nonlinear can show strong nonlinearities in parts of the Fourier space. These nonlinearities can exceed in strength the level of nonlinearities recovered from low cross helicity systems. If these Fourier space regions are energetically significant then nonlinear effects can govern parts of the spectrum while the other parts remain subject to linear effects.",

            "abstract": "Developments in the last year, including the President's new plan for reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and the recent launch of OCO-2, provide more urgent incentive to develop reliable methods for determination of greenhouse gas emissions from urban environments. It is clear that the requirements for measurable, reportable, and verifiable emission rates for point sources and area sources, including individual urban environments, challenge the capabilities of the scientific community. The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) was established in 2010 as a multi-institution collaborative effort aimed at development of new tools for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from fine (~1km2) scale to urban area-wide scales, with accuracy and precision ideally approaching 10%. In the past year, INFLUX has seen a number of new developments and achievements. Among these are: expansion of the bottom-up emissions data product (Hestia) to include a wider domain and more contemporary years (up to 2012); new experiments to assess precision in the aircraft mass balance measurement for both CO2 and CH4; improved source apportionment for CH4 emission sources around the city, including quantitative measurements for several point sources; continued data acquisition for CO, CO2, CH4, and 14CO2 at 12 towers around the city; inverse modeling determinations of spatially resolved CO2 and CH4 fluxes relying in part on the updated Hestia emissions priors. We developed an improved understanding of the role of the biosphere in the urban CO2 measurements, observations of the \"urban dome\" column concentrations from a TCCON, and improved understanding of the temporal scale boundary layer dynamics from radiosonde launches, aircraft vertical profiles, and Doppler LIDAR measurements of winds and boundary layer heights. The INFLUX efforts are producing a relatively well-understood urban environment, which should provide a useful reference point for OCO-2 and other satellite-based determinations of greenhouse gas emission rates and trends in those rates. Here we will summarize the state of the INFLUX project and its achievements, and lay out some of the challenges to be tackled in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Our new results from teleseismic, finite-frequency, body-wave tomography analysis reveal a relatively steep east-dipping fast velocity anomaly beneath the Southeastern US. The resolving power of our dataset is good enough to retrieve major mantle anomalies, such as this fast velocity body, owing to the dense receiver coverage provided by US Transportable Array (TA) and the SouthEastern Suture of the Appalachian Margin Experiment (SESAME). Various resolution and recovery tests demonstrate the robustness of this anomaly in our tomographic model between the depths of 60 and 660 km. Our images reveal that the dip of this structure decreases significantly in the mantle transition zone where it terminates. We also observe major gaps in the lateral continuity of this structure.\nBased on the amplitude, location and geometry of the velocity perturbation, we interpret this anomaly as remnant subducted lithosphere, suspended in the upper mantle after a subduction phase as young as 100-110 Ma or as old as 1Ga. Basic calculations and evaluations on the geometry and location of this anomaly help us to narrow down the origin of this slab to the Farallon flat-slab subduction in the west and Grenville Subduction during assembly of supercontinent Rodinia. Our images reveal possible mechanisms that would allow this slab to remain in the upper mantle without sinking into deeper mantle for such extended periods of time. We believe the flat geometry of the slab near the transition zone and the fragmented nature provide important clues about processes that could delay/resist the sinking while providing necessary time for it to transform into a more neutrally buoyant state. In this respect, we believe our results have broad implications for subduction processes and piece-meal slab failure, as well as tectonic implications for characteristics of former subduction zones that help shape North American Plate.",

            "abstract": "The built environment often changes quickly in response to human activities, thus contributing to an evolution of stream chemistry over time. Depending upon development and management strategies, these changes can result in pulses and/or long-term trends. Here, we explore patterns of evolving salinization of fresh water over time, and we evaluate the potential water quality implications of fresh water salinization. We show that there has been global salinization of freshwater across urbanizing landscapes over a century. We also show that human-accelerated weathering in watersheds and river alkalinization can further influence regional rates of salinization (in addition to anthropogenic sources such as road salts, sewage leaks, etc.). Finally, we investigate how salinization of fresh water can impact stream sediment fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and sulfate in watersheds across a land use gradient at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. The impacts of salinization on mobilization and uptake of carbon, nutrients, and sulfate in streams warrant further consideration in water quality management strategies. Overall, we propose that salinization can be a \"universal tracer\" of watershed urbanization globally with major regional consequences for drinking water and evolution of biogeochemical cycles in freshwater ecosystems.",

In this letter, we propose that the electron halo is produced by the kinetic-scale turbulence driven by the nanoflare-accelerated keV electrons in the inner solar corona. The solar wind advects the core-halo feature of EVDFs and kinetic fluctuations from the corona into interplanetary plasma through open field lines. Based on the heating mechanism proposed, we find the location of the velocity ``break\" discerning the core and halo is at three times of the thermal velocity of core; the ratio of halo-core temperature is about 6; and a relic relative drift that is comparable to the core thermal velocity exists between the core and the halo, a signature of two stream instability. These predictions are consistent with existing observations of solar wind EVDFs.",

            "abstract": "The Northern Current (NC) is a branch of the general North-Western Mediterranean cyclonic circulation extending from the Ligurian to the Catalan Sea (Millot, Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans, vol. 15, 1991). In winter and early spring, instabilities of this slope current are intense and can generate eddies, meanders and filaments. The study of mesoscale structures is crucial in the coastal area because of their physical and biogeochemical impact on ecosystems. They play a role in water, chemicals and nutrients transport, vertical mixing and possible trapping of biological materials.\nResults from a combined observational effort put forth in March 2012 during the IMEDIA cruise dedicated to eddy tracking are presented. This work aims at providing experimental evidence of the effects that mesoscale exerts on the NC dynamics via an innovative and complementary data set. A Slocum Glider equipped with a CTD was deployed along the French coast from Nice to Toulon for one month and performed cross-current sections down to 600m depth. Drifters were deployed before the cruise in the Corsica Channel and close to Italy. Concurrent observations were obtained along the vessel track by a thermosalinograph and a fluorometer (subsurface measurements), and using a CTD and a Vessel-Mounted ADCP during the 11-day oceanographic cruise on board of the Research Vessel Tethys II. Additional water profiling was performed using a Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) equipped with a CTD and capable of profiling down to 400m depth at a speed of 4 knots.\nThe combined use of data from the MVP and the ship-based ADCP measurements reveals the presence of an instability of the NC north of the Corsica Island. The main branch of the current is moved westward and forms a meander. It is characterized by a density decrease down to 350m of the water column, associated with a salinity decrease of 0.4-0.6 psu (see Figure). Its location is confirmed by high-resolution satellite images as the associated water masses are cooler and more oligotrophic than the adjacent ones.\nAdditional measurements from the glider deployed off the French coast show that inside the NC vein, the water column has a multi-layer structure with the presence of filaments of differing salinity and temperature.",

            "abstract": "We examined whether people living under significant temperature anomalies connect their sensory experiences to climate change and the role that media plays in this process. We used Twitter messages containing words “climate change” and “global warming” as the indicator of attention that public pays to the issue. Specifically, the goals were: (1) to investigate whether people immediately notice significant local weather anomalies and connect them to climate change and (2) to examine the role of mass media in this process. Over 2 million tweets were collected for a two-year period (2012 – 2013) and were assigned to 157 urban areas in the continental USA (Figure 1). Geographical locations of the tweets were identified with a geolocation resolving algorithm based the profile of the users. Daily number of tweets (tweeting rate) was computed for 157 conterminous USA urban areas and adjusted for data acquisition errors. The USHCN daily minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained for the station locations closest to the centers of the urban areas and the 1981-2010 30-year temperature mean and standard deviation were used as the climate normals. For the analysis, we computed the following indices for each day of 2012 – 2013 period: standardized temperature anomaly, absolute standardized temperature anomaly, and extreme cold and hot temperature anomalies for each urban zone. The extreme cold and hot temperature anomalies were then transformed into country-level values that represent the number of people living in extreme temperature conditions.\nThe rate of tweeting on climate change was regressed on the time variables, number of climate change publications in the mass media, and temperature. In the majority of regression models, the mass media and temperature variables were significant at the p<0.001 level. Additionally, we did not find convincing evidence that the media acts as a mediator in the relationship between local weather and climate change discourse intensity. Our analysis of Twitter data confirmed that the public is able to recognize extreme temperature anomalies and connects these anomalies to climate change. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of social network data for research on public climate change perception.",

            "abstract": "The Southeast (SE) Pacific has experienced a marked cooling since the late 70's, as detected in stations along the west coast of South America and satellite derived SST observations. The observed cooling further extends into the tropical Pacific where it has been mostly interpreted as natural variability and related to the negative phase of the PDO. While the CMIP-5 historical simulations in general fail to detect the cooling over the Pacific during the last few decades, the multi-model trend does shows a minimum warming over the SE Pacific and a few models do show a cooling there, suggesting that some of this trend can be a interpreted as a forced response to increase greenhouse gas concentrations.\nConsidering the CMIP5 historical runs and reanalysis data we show that the cooling trend over the SE Pacific is related with the enhanced anticyclonic circulation in this region but exhibits no correlation with the trends of the trade winds. The reinforced SE Pacific anticyclone -seen both in the reanalysis and models- drives stronger low-level southeasterly winds which can cool the ocean surface through enhanced latent heat flux (evaporation), particularly over the extremely dry SE Pacific.\nWe finally show that the increase in sea-level-pressure over the southern fringe of the SE Pacific can be associated with the expansion of the Hadley Cell, a trend that has been observed and projected to continue in the future in concert with the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations. Therefore, the resulting cooling over a vast region of the SE Pacific can in turn act as a negative dynamical feedback on global warming. Indeed, the regional anomaly cooling off the west coast of South America appears as a robust feature in future climate prediction that also scale with the greenhouse gas concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Developing scientific software is a continuous balance between not reinventing the wheel and getting fragile codes to interoperate with one another. Binary software distributions such as Anaconda provide a robust starting point for many scientific software packages, but this solution alone is insufficient for many scientific software developers. HashDist provides a critical component of the development workflow, enabling highly customizable, source-driven, and reproducible builds for scientific software stacks, available from both the IPython Notebook and the command line.\nTo address these issues, the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center has funded the development of HashDist in collaboration with Simula Research Laboratories and the University of Texas at Austin. HashDist is motivated by a functional approach to package build management, and features intelligent caching of sources and builds, parametrized build specifications, and the ability to interoperate with system compilers and packages. HashDist enables the easy specification of \"software stacks\", which allow both the novice user to install a default environment and the advanced user to configure every aspect of their build in a modular fashion. As an advanced feature, HashDist builds can be made relocatable, allowing the easy redistribution of binaries on all three major operating systems as well as cloud, and supercomputing platforms. As a final benefit, all HashDist builds are reproducible, with a build hash specifying exactly how each component of the software stack was installed.\nThis talk discusses the role of HashDist in the hydrological sciences, including its use by the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory in the development and deployment of the Proteus Toolkit as well as the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support project. We demonstrate HashDist in action, and show how it can effectively support development, deployment, teaching, and reproducibility for scientists working in the hydrological sciences.\nThe HashDist documentation is available from: http://hashdist.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ HashDist is currently hosted at: https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist",

            "abstract": "Extreme heat events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity in the coming decades [1]. The physical effects of extreme heat on human populations are well-documented, and anticipating changes in future exposure to extreme heat is a key component of adequate planning/mitigation [2, 3]. Exposure to extreme heat depends not only on changing climate, but also on changes in the size and spatial distribution of the human population. Here we focus on systematically quantifying exposure to extreme heat as a function of both climate and population change.\nWe compare exposure outcomes across multiple global climate and spatial population scenarios, and characterize the relative contributions of each to population exposure to extreme heat. We consider a 2 x 2 matrix of climate and population output, using projections of heat extremes corresponding to RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 from the NCAR community land model, and spatial population projections for SSP 3 and SSP 5 from the NCAR spatial population downscaling model. Our primary comparison is across RCPs - exposure outcomes from RCP 4.5 versus RCP 8.5 - paying particular attention to how variation depends on the choice of SSP in terms of aggregate global and regional exposure, as well as the spatial distribution of exposure. We assess how aggregate exposure changes based on the choice of SSP, and which driver is more important, population or climate change (i.e. does that outcome vary more as a result of RCP or SSP). We further decompose the population component to analyze the contributions of total population change, migration, and changes in local spatial structure.\nPreliminary results from a similar study of the US suggests a four-to-six fold increase in total exposure by the latter half of the 21st century. Changes in population are as important as changes in climate in driving this outcome, and there is regional variation in the relative importance of each. Aggregate population growth, as well as redistribution of the population across larger US regions, strongly affects outcomes while smaller-scale spatial patterns of population change have smaller effects.\n[1] Collins, M. et al.

            "abstract": "Impact events forming large craters (or, impact basins) several hundreds of kilometers in diameter have profoundly affected the evolution of the terrestrial planets. Previously acquired gravity and topography data of the Moon have shown evidence of crustal thinning in the central regions of these basins, which is a consequence of the basin formation process. High-resolution crustal thickness maps derived from the Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) and Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data afford an unambiguous measure of the lateral extent of crustal thinning in lunar basins (protobasins, peak-ring and multi-ring basins). This region of crustal thinning can be used as a measure of basin size. In this work, we used the iSALE-2D numerical shock physics hydrocode to model the formation of lunar basins. We tested our simulations against crater structures observed by GRAIL. As a result, a new scaling law for impact basins on the Moon is derived. We show relationships between the transient crater size (including the impactor properties) as calculated by the hydrocode and the final crustal thinning diameter of an impact basin as well as an approximate relationship to the location of the basin rings, as mapped by LOLA and GRAIL. These scaling laws include lateral variations in the target properties, namely between the Procellarum KREEP Terrane on the nearside and the lunar highlands on the farside hemisphere. This work provides additional constraints on the extent of the Late Heavy Bombardment epoch.",

            "abstract": "Five small lava domes erupted at the NW margin of Long Valley caldera from 41 to 27 Ka. They range from trachyte (66% SiO2) to trachyandesite (60%), with the youngest lava being the most mafic. Mixing features are pervasive, with enclaves, kspar megacrysts, crystal clots of various grain sizes, compositions, and degrees of resorption indicating multiple episodes of mafic injection, mobilization of young granitic material, and mixing/mingling of alkali basalt with trachyte to alkali rhyolite magmas similar to those at Mammoth Mountain. Enclaves range from 49 to 57% SiO2 and form a mixing line with a felsic end member at 67% SiO2. In order to quantify the distribution of enclaves and large (1-4 cm), resorbed, kspar megacrysts, outcrop-scale point counting was performed at >200 locations on the lavas. Contour maps show that kspar content is highest at the vent, but mafic-intermediate enclaves are irregularly distributed. Fe-Ti oxide temperatures for the host trachytic magmas are 915-1080°C, with the coolest temperatures at flow termini. Enclave temperatures are similar, 950-1120°C, with cooler temperatures in more felsic enclaves that are typically located near flow termini, indicating prolonged thermal and chemical interaction with the host magma. Calculated pressures are 2-4 kbar for host magmas, but some mafic crystal clots yield pressures up to 12 kbar, near the Moho at Long Valley. The kspar megacrysts match the composition of phenocrysts in late-erupted Bishop Tuff, suggesting that the megacrysts originated from solidified equivalents of magma remaining after eruption of the Bishop Tuff at 760 Ka. These data suggest a model in which alkali basalts are generated in the uppermost mantle and, through AFC, evolve into trachytes. Repeated basaltic injections keep the trachyte hot and partially melt young granites, resulting in entrainment of kspar megacrysts.\nThe most mafic enclaves in the NW domes match the alkali basalt compositions of the most mafic enclaves in Mono Craters Dome 12, 20 km to the north. This could indicate a shared mafic source at depth. Dome 12 is considerably more eroded than the rest of the 10- to 0.6-Ka Mono Craters, and may be about the same age as the NW domes. If so, there was a major mafic intrusion event along the N-S Mono Basin/ Mammoth Mountain trend at 27-41 Ka.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties surrounding vegetation response to increased disturbance rates associated with climate change remains a major global change issue for Amazon forests. Additionally, turnover rates in the Western Amazon are doubled compared to the Central Amazon, and notable gradients currently exist in specific wood density and aboveground biomass (AGB). This study investigates the extent to which the variation in disturbance regimes contributes to these regional gradients. To address these issues, we evaluated disturbance-recovery processes under scenarios of increased disturbance rates in a Central Amazon forest using first ZELIG-TROP, a dynamic vegetation gap model which we calibrated using long-term inventory data, and second using the Community Land Model (CLM), a global land surface model. Upon doubling the mortality rate in the Central Amazon to mirror the disturbance regime in the Western Amazon of ~2% mortality, the two regions continued to differ in multiple forest processes. With the inclusion of elevated natural disturbances, at steady-state, AGB significantly decreased by 41.9% with no significant difference between modeled AGB and empirical AGB from the western Amazon datasets (104 vs. 107 Mg C ha-1). However, different processes were responsible for the reductions in AGB between the models and empirical dataset. The empirical dataset suggests that a decrease in wood density drives the reduction in AGB. While decreased stand basal area was the driver of AGB loss in ZELIG-TROP, and decreased leaf area index (LAI) was the driver in CLM, two forest attributes that do not significantly vary across the Amazon Basin. Further comparisons found that stem density, specific wood density, and growth rates differed between the two Amazonian regions. This suggests that: 1) the variability between regions cannot be entirely explained by the variability in disturbance regime, but rather potentially sensitive to intrinsic environmental factors; or 2) the models are not accurately simulating all forest characteristics in response to increased disturbances. Next we evaluated the fidelity of elevated tree mortality in CLM. Similar to ZELIG-TROP, CLM predicted a net carbon loss of 49.9%, getting the correct answer for the wrong reason, and the temporal variability in carbon stock and fluxes was not replicated in CLM.",

We use eight years of measurements from 26 continuous GPS stations across the RGR installed as part of a collaborative EarthScope experiment. We combine this data with regional Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) and National Geodetic Survey (NGS) CORS GPS stations, and survey-mode data collected on NGS benchmarks to investigate how deformation is distributed across a broad area from the Great Plains to the Colorado Plateau. The data from over 150 stations are processed using GAMIT/GLOBK, and time series, velocities, strain rates are estimated with respect to realizations of a stable North America reference frame, such as NA12. This study extends our previous analysis, based on 4 years of data, which found an approximately uniform 1.2 nanostrain/yr east-west extensional strain rate across the entire region that was not concentrated on the narrow surface expression of the rift. We expand on this previous work by using a denser network of GPS stations and analyzing longer time series, which reduce horizontal velocity uncertainties to approximately 0.15 mm/yr. We also improve the accuracy of the estimated velocity uncertainties by robustly characterizing time-correlated noise. The noise models indicate that both power-law and flicker noise are present in the time series along with white noise. On average, power law noise constitutes about 90% of the total noise in the vertical component and 60% in the horizontal components for the RGR sites. We use the time series, and velocity and strain-rate estimates to constrain spatial and temporal variations in the deformation field in order to locate possible regions of strain localization and detect transient deformation signals, and to address some of the kinematic and dynamic issues raised by the observation that a broad, low seismic velocity zone underlies the narrow geologic surface expression of the RGR defined by normal fault bounded basins.",

A 1.65 m integrating sphere and overflights of Ivanpah Playa, NV are used for radiometric calibration. Radiometric cross-comparisons with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), also flying on the ER-2, are used to validate the radiometric scale. For polarimetric calibration, a well-calibrated Polarization State Generator is used to provide known polarimetric inputs. A high-extinction rotating wiregrid polarizer is used to derive polarimetric calibration coefficients for each pixel, and the results are then validated using partially polarized light generated using tilted glass plates.

Traditional REU models (1 faculty to 1 student/on campus) have been shown to be effective in supporting student movement into graduate programs but often fail to attract a diverse group of candidates. In addition, they rely for success on the relationship between faculty and student, which can often be undermined by unrealistic expectations on the part of the student about the mentor relationship, and can be exacerbated by cultural misunderstanding, conflicting discourse, or students’ personal or family issues. At this REU site, peer mentorship and support plays a large role. Students work together to select their research question, follow the project to completion and present the results. Students from both native and non-native backgrounds learn about the culture of the partner reservations and work on a project that is of immediate local concern. The REU also teaches students protocols for working on Native American lands that support good relations between reservation and University. Analysis of participant data gathered from surveys and interview over the course of our 3-year program indicates that the team approach is successful. Students noted that collaborating with other teams was rewarding and mentors reported positively about their roles in providing guidance for the student’s future plans. While there are still challenges to this approach (e.g. optimal team size and structure, interpersonal conflicts among team members, geographically dispersed teams), the model has proven effective in recruiting and retaining students from culturally, geographically, and economically diverse backgrounds.",

            "abstract": "Deltas and their flat, fertile lands have become the most densely populated places on earth, but, partly because of anthropogenic interactions with fluvial, coastal, and wetland processes, their inhabitants are increasingly susceptible to natural disasters. Humans have decreased sediment supply delivered to rivers and ultimately wetlands and the coast, causing accelerating subsidence. The natural course and processes of many rivers have been altered through channelization, artificial levees, and dams, which ‘perch’ the river above its floodplain. As the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) increases, so will surface aggradation and channel backfilling, resulting in a fluvial system that is more vulnerable to flooding and frequent avulsions. To investigate the effects of increasing RSLR and anthropogenic manipulations on delta morphodynamics, we create new avulsion and floodplain modules to couple with the 3D mode of Sedflux (Hutton and Syvitski, 2008), a stratigraphic basin-filling model. We replace the probabilistic approach of channel avulsion previously used in the model with a module incorporating the steepest-decent methodology used in Jerolmack and Paola (2007), and a floodplain algorithm to deposit sediment on subaerial cells. Model experiments with Sedflux and the new modules address the effects on delta morphodynamics of varying rates of RSLR (affecting base-level), changes in sediment delivery (adjusting the upstream boundary conditions), and restriction of natural fluvial dynamics (inhibiting avulsions). The work presented here is the first step in a more expansive project to develop a new 3D eco-morphodynamic delta model system that will be based on further model couplings, including a vegetation module (that will affect fluvial and floodplain dynamics) and a coastline module (that will re-work the shoreline based on wave-driven alongshore sediment transport). The model system results will be tested and calibrated based on comparisons with observations from both the field and physical experiments.\nHutton, E, and J Syvitski (2008), Sedflux 2.0: An advanced process-response model that generates three-dimensional stratigraphy, Comput.

            "abstract": "Most lakes and reservoirs are known to have surface carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations that are supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere, and hence nearly all of them are net emitters of CO2. Global carbon emissions from lakes account for 0.06 to 0.84 Pg C year-1, a substantial amount relative to other fluxes of the continental C balance. Therefore, a proper understanding of the land carbon cycle and its sensitivity to external perturbations requires detailed knowledge of drivers of global CO2 supersaturation in lakes. CO2 supersaturation has generally been attributed to a widespread imbalance of lake net ecosystem production towards net heterotrophy, but recent findings challenge this interpretation. Here we show that an integrated perspective including lake net ecosystem production together with precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals and inputs of dissolved inorganic carbon from the watershed, substantially improves our understanding of the processes leading to CO2 supersaturation in lakes with alkalinity above 1 meq L-1. Our results indicate that CO2 supersaturation is independent of net ecosystem production in many lakes, and that a significant amount of the CO2 evaded through their surface is directly related to weathering processes in the watershed that supply alkalinity to surface waters. After evaluation of the worldwide distribution of alkalinity across lakes we show that CO2 emissions related to weathering processes are relevant in tropical and temperate latitudes, but negligible in boreal regions.",

However, the Berkeley Atmospheric CO2 Observation Network (BeACON) project aims to provide a better understanding of the emissions and physical processes governing CO2 by deploying a high density of moderate-precision instruments. Here we present the first estimate of hourly urban carbon dioxide fluxes at 1 km spatial resolution in California's Bay Area using the BeACON network. The CO2 fluxes are estimated in a mesoscale inverse modeling framework using WRF-STILT and a custom state-of-the-science prior inventory. We also present a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) with synthetic observations derived from our custom 1 km inventory that resolves fine-scale CO2 fluxes such as individual highways and attempt to retrieve them using the EDGARv4.2 and VULCAN inventories, which are too coarse to resolve individual highways. These OSSEs allow us to determine the extent to which a dense network can quantify fine-scale CO2 fluxes from sources such as traffic and provide an estimate of the information content of a dense network. This will allow us to place rigorous error bounds on the CO2 fluxes from California's Bay Area and inform future greenhouse gas measurement strategies.",

            "abstract": "This August 2014, a 14-day expedition of the E/V NAUTILUS of the OCEAN EXPLORATION TRUST will explore the region delimited by two deep straits of the northern Caribbean, the Windward passage and the Jamaica Channel. The morphology of these straits is controlled by two transform faults: The Septentrional fault, which stretches between Cuba and Haiti (slip rate: ~13 mm/yr), and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault (EPGF), which stretches between Jamaica and Haiti (slip rate: ~9 mm/yr). Together, these faults bound the Gonave microplate, an elongated platelet caught between the North America plate and Caribbean plates. The Septentrional fault ruptured in 1842, devastating the town of Cap Haitien. The EPGF ruptured catastrophically in 2010 near Port-au-Prince (death toll > 100,000). Tsunamis were associated with both earthquakes. Oblique slip on these two faults is presumably controlling the history of uplift and subsidence of the seafloor, and has therefore also been regulating the water exchanges between the north central Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. New multibeam bathymetric and CHIRP sub-bottom profiling data will be acquired with the E/V NAUTILUS, while the ROV HERCULES will be used to collect video, water and rock samples, as well as water column physical properties.\nWe anticipate that this survey will document the following: (1) The nature of drowned carbonate platforms, which in turn may provide useful markers to assess rates of vertical deformation along the two faults. (2) The extent of major landslides detected on the steep fore reefs from existing multibeam bathymetric data. (3) Whether fluids are actively seeping along the fault traces or in association with the landslides, as has been reported elsewhere around the World. (4) If cold seeps are indeed present, to what extent their associated ecosystems are affected by the bottom currents that flow through these gateways. Altogether, the new findings should contribute to a better understanding of the natural hazards associated with two major transform faults.",

            "abstract": "An extensive investigation on tsunami generation and the resulting coastal inundation due to coseismic seabed displacements has been performed for the Cascadia Subduction Zone. We have adopted a new approach to represent coseismic seabed deformation in giant earthquakes, which avoids artefacts generated at the edges of block deformations. We represent the deformation with arbitrary shaped 4-sided polygons in which subsidences and uplifts are represented as quadratic curves. The arbitrary shapes of these polygons allow the realistic representation of the deformed seabed as a continuous surface except at the trench, where the fault breaks the surface. Experimental Design is used to select combinations of three source characteristics generating different event scenarios amongst Cascadia whole-margin ruptures; further work on other event types is in progress. Following that, the numerical model VOLNA has been run for the different scenarios, obtaining the induced tsunami waves propagation and coastal inundation. Statistical emulation has been applied to the wave elevation time series evaluations for many locations. Statistical emulators approximate expensive computer models: they are powerful tools for analyses that require many model evaluations since they can give accurate and fast probabilistic predictions. Registration and Functional Principal Components techniques are applied to the emulation process leading to further improvement in predictions. Leave-one-out diagnostics are used to validate the emulator, showing excellent agreement in predictions and model evaluations. The statistical emulation is also used for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. These two analyses require a large number of evaluations and hence cannot be carried out with the expensive computer model. Our approach can be applied to provide uncertainty estimates both in operational tsunami warnings and in tsunami risk modeling, and can be used with many different numerical models.",

            "abstract": "Although most cratons maintain stable, some exceptions are present, such as the North China craton, North Atlantic craton, and Wyoming craton, which have experienced dramatic lithospheric deformation/thinning. Mechanisms triggering cratonic thinning remains enigmatic [Lee et al., 2011]. Using a 2D thermo-mechanical coupled numerical model [Gerya and Yuen, 2007], we investigate two possible mechanisms: (1) stratification of cratonic lithospheric mantle, and (2) rheological weakening due to hydration.\nLithospheric mantle stratification is a common feature in cratonic areas which has been demonstrated by geophysical and geochemical studies [Thybo and Perchuc, 1997; Griffin et al., 2004; Romanowicz, 2009; Rychert and Shearer, 2009; Yuan and Romanowicz, 2010]. The influence of lithospheric mantle stratification during craton evolution remains poorly understood. A rheologically weak layer representing hydrated and/or metasomatized composition is implemented in the lithospheric mantle. Our results show that the weak mantle layer changes the dynamics of lithospheric extension by enhancing the deformation of the overlying mantle and crust and inhibiting deformation of the underlying mantle [Liao et al., 2013; Liao and Gerya, 2014]. Modeling results are compared with North China and North Atlantic cratons. Our work indicates that although the presence of a weak layer may not be sufficient to initiate craton deformation, it enhances deformation by lowering the required extensional plate boundary force.\nRheological weakening due to hydration is a possible mechanism triggering/enhancing craton deformation, especially for cratons jaxtaposing with a subduction, since water can release from a subducting slab. We investigate the influence of wet mantle flow laws [Hirth and Kohlstedt, 2003], in which a water parameter (i.e. constant water content) is involved. Our results show that wet dislocation alone does not accelerate cratonic deformation significantly. However, if wet diffusion creep is incorporated, combined effect of wet dislocation and wet diffusion creeps enhance lithosphere deformation dramatically. Lithospheric material drips off rapidly from the lithosphere base to asthenosphere, and thins lithosphere by ~ 40 km.",

            "abstract": "Among the most significant phenomenological theories of turbulence, two are commonly singled out: the von Karman-Prandtl logarithmic law for the mean velocity profile and the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the local structure of the turbulent velocity. These two developments have often been regarded as separate given that the log-law is an outcome of restrictive boundary effects on eddy sizes responsible for mixing, while the local structure of turbulence is associated with locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence far from any boundary. Furthermore, these two theories have stirred significant debate with some stating that the von Karman-Prandtl law should be abandoned and replaced by a power-law when viscosity is small but finite. Here, connections are explored between spectral descriptions of turbulence and the mean velocity profile in the equilibrium layer of wall-bounded flows using a modeled budget for the co-spectral density. Employing a standard model for the wall normal velocity variance and a Rotta-like return-to-isotropy closure for the pressure-strain effects, the co-spectrum describing the momentum flux is derived. The approach establishes a relation between the von Karman, the one-dimensional Kolmogorov and the Rotta constants. Depending on the choices made about small-scale intermittency corrections and how it is introduced into the energy cascade, the logarithmic mean velocity profile or a power-law profile with an exponent that depends on the intermittency correction are derived thereby offering a new perspective on this long standing debate.",

            "abstract": "The large-scale circulation features that are responsible for the structure and evolution of the moisture and precipitation fields in the MJO are examined, using the analysis protocol of Adames and Wallace (2014a,b). The analysis reveals the dynamical processes that lead to the buildup of moisture to the east of the region of maximum ascent and drying to the west of it. To the east, a deep plume of ascent confined to the equatorial belt advects moisture upward from the surface toward the middle and upper troposphere while diffluence above the boundary layer acts to widen the anomalously moist region in the lower troposphere. To the west of the region of strongest ascent, equatorially-symmetric, shallow meridional circulations induce drying through anomalous descent beneath the 600 hPa layer while confluence above the boundary layer advects drier air from higher latitudes. The resulting drying is co-located with anomalous westerlies associated with forced equatorial Rossby waves. The major features that give rise to this systematic moistening and drying during the MJO cycle support the “bottom-up” evolution in vertical velocity and the characteristic “swallowtail” shape in vertical motion and precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Intentional modification of Earth’s climate by geoengineering can restore global mean temperature in climate model simulations but is expected to cause regional inequalities in temperature change and shifts in precipitation which may depend on the geoengineering method employed. In simulations of twenty-first century climate using the UKMO HadGEM2 climate model, we have assessed the effectiveness of two regional scale geoengineering methods (crop and desert albedo modification) and four large scale geoengineering methods (ocean albedo modification, marine cloud brightening by sea salt, cirrus cloud thinning and stratospheric sulphur). We projected anthropogenic emissions based on RCP4.5, applied geoengineering from 2020 to 2069 and quantified the impact on temperature and precipitation for 2040-2059 compared to a no-geoengineering control simulation. We found forcing for crop albedo modification was largely insignificant (-0.3 ± 0.3 Wm-2). Desert albedo modification had a catastrophic impact on tropical precipitation drying the Amazon, the Sahel, India and China. Of the large scale geoengineering simulations, only stratospheric sulphur and ocean albedo modification were potentially scalable to temporarily return global mean temperature to the late twentieth century climate. Cirrus cloud thinning was the only method that increased global mean precipitation (+0.7%) while in other respects the four methods were remarkable in the consistency of their precipitation response to geoengineering compared to the control simulation (Figure 1). Over land, precipitation reduced less (between -0.5% and +1.8%) than global precipitation (between -3.8% and +0.7%). A northward shift in tropical precipitation over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific was found for all four methods, likely driven by cloud rapid adjustments and changes in atmospheric circulation. After geoengineering, during 2080-2099, significant differences in maritime tropical precipitation persisted despite regional precipitation elsewhere being generally within a 95% confidence interval of the control. We conclude that delivering equitable and predictable changes in tropical precipitation is currently the greatest climate related challenge for geoengineering.",

            "abstract": "Uranium contamination in groundwater can be mitigated in anoxic zones by iron-reducing bacteria that reduce soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) and by uranium immobilization through complexation and sorption. Wetlands often link ground and surface-waters, making them strategic systems for potentially limiting migration of uranium contamination. Little is known about how drought periods that result in the drying of wetland soils, and consequent redox changes, affect uranium fate and transport in wetlands. In order to better understand the fate and stability of immobilized uranium in wetland soils, and how dry periods affect the uranium stability, we dosed saturated wetland mesocosms planted with Scirpus acutus with low levels of uranyl-acetate for 5 months before imposing a 9-day drying period followed by a 13-day rewetting period. Concentrations of uranium in mesocosm effluent increased after rewetting, but the cumulative amount of uranium released in the 13 days following the drying constituted less than 1% of the uranium immobilized in the soil during the 5 months prior to the drought. This low level of remobilization suggests that the uranium immobilized in these soils was not primarily bioreduced U(IV), which could have been oxidized to soluble U(VI) during the drought and released in the effluent during the subsequent flood. XANES analyses confirm that most of the uranium immobilized in the mesocosms was U(VI) sorbed to iron oxides. Compared to mesocosms that did not experience drying or rewetting, mesocosms that were sacrificed immediately after drying and after 13 days of rewetting had less uranium in soil near roots and more uranium on root surfaces. Metal-reducing bacteria only dominated the bacterial community after 13 days of rewetting and not immediately after drying, indicating that these bacteria are not responsible for this redistribution of uranium after the drying and rewetting. Results show that short periods of drought conditions in a wetland may impact uranium distribution, but these conditions may not cause large losses of immobilized uranium from the wetland.",

We focused on quantifying transport mechanisms important for upscaling in time and distance. This will help determine the long-term fate and transport of radionuclides to aid in risk assessments. We selected a fractured/weathered granodiorite at the Grimsel Test Site (GTS) in Switzerland as a model crystalline rock repository system because the system has been thoroughly studied and field experiments involving radionuclides have already been conducted. Working on this system provides a unique opportunity to compare lab experiments with field-scale observations.\nWeathered fracture fill material (FFM) and bentonite used as backfill at the GTS were characterized (e.g., BET, SEM/EDS, QXRD), and batch and breakthrough column experiments were conducted. Solutions were prepared in synthetic groundwaters that matched the natural water chemistry. FFM samples were crushed, rinsed, sieved (150-355 µm), and equilibrated with synthetic groundwater. Bentonite was crushed, sodium-saturated, equilibrated with synthetic groundwater, and settled to yield a stable suspension. Suspensions were equilibrated with Am, Cs, or Pu. All experiments were conducted with Teflon®materials to limit sorption to system components. After radionuclide/colloid injections reached stability, radionuclide-free solutions were injected to observe the desorption and release behavior.\nAliquots of effluent were measured for pH, colloid concentration, and total and dissolved radionuclides. Unanalyzed effluent from the first column was then injected through a second column of fresh material. The process was repeated for a third column and the results of all three breakthrough curves were modeled with a multi-site/multi-rate MATLAB code to elucidate the sorption rate coefficients and binding site densities of the bentonite colloids and fracture fill material. Nearly 50% of the sorbed Am was exchanged from the colloids to the fracture filling material in each of the three columns; whereas, less Cs and Pu was desorbed with each pass through a new column. Using a two-site kinetic model allowed for interrogation of desorption rates and dominant transport parameters.",

ComMIT is a desktop application providing a powerful and fully functional, yet easy-to use graphical user interface to the NCTR-developed MOST tsunami forecasting model. ComMIT is a self-contained downloadable application available from NCTR for use by qualified and novice modelers alike. We have recently added functionality that allows ComMIT to retrieve the prefered model solution for tsunami events from the Tweb Web Service. A ComMIT user with access to high resolution coastal bathymetry can generate detailed inundation models for real or synthetic events for their areas of interest. Then with the push of a button, the ComMIT user can upload their model results to Tweb where a community of tsunami modelers and forecasters can see these model results displayed in Tweb, along with other operational and contributed inundation forecast models. Besides the crowdsourcing aspect of tsunami modeling that will allow tsunami forecasters to get inundation model inputs from areas they normally would not consider, these contributed flooding models could provide forecasters with an early model solution verification capability by allowing model result comparisons with local tide gauge data in areas where operational models have not been developed. In addition, with the proper training this tool is very useful for education and as a vehicle for community tsunami hazard assessment. We will illustrate the model solution and results interchange capabilities now possible with these two applications.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter(DOM) fluxes from terrestrial to marine environments have increased as a result of anthropogenic activities and climate change, and DOM is known to facilitate the transport of both metals and trace organics. The nature and composition of DOM may influence its binding properties to metals and thus affect their mobility and fate in aquatic environments. Humic substances make up the majority of DOM in many aquatic ecosystems. Metals such as Fe and Cu are not only important as nutrients in aquatic systems, but also in controlling biogeochemical and ecotoxicological processes respectively. Thus, gaining a better understanding on the interaction of humic substances with Fe or Cu is important in the assessment of the bioavailability of such metals in aquatic systems.\nIn this study, the binding processes of two different DOM samples (Suwanee River humic acid, SRHA and Nordic Lake fulvic acid, NLFA)with Fe(III) and Cu(II) were examined. With the assistance of excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), three humic-like components (C1, C2 and C4), and one microbial humic-like component (C3), were identified in the characterization of the samples. The quenching rates of C2 and C4 fluorescence in the presence of Cu were similar, which were slightly faster than that forC1. In contrast, the C3 fluorescence was significantly less affected by the addition of metals. In the presence of Fe, the most significant quenching was also observed for C2, and the behavior of C4 fluorescence was dependent on the pH value. Some differences in the fluorescence quenching were also observed between the two humic acid standards (one more higher-plant/terrestrially derived vs. the other more microbial/aquatic derived). In addition, pH had a significant effect on the metal binding with significantly lower quenching at lower pH values. Some variations where observed for the higher pH conditions particularly for Cu(II). A modified version of the Ryan-Weber model was used to calculate conditional stability constants (KM) and the complex capacity (CL). Effects of metal type, DOM type and pH on the fluorescence quenching are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recovery Glacier penetrates deep into the interior of East Antarctica. The subglacial hydraulic system beneath this glacier includes active lakes aligned along the glacier trunk and four giant lakes near the onset of the fast flow. The characteristics of this subglacial system and its impacts on ice flow are therefore central questions for the dynamics of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The existence of these lakes is hypothesized to explain satellite-measured ice-surface motion and smoothness. However, direct evidence of the existence of the giant Recovery lakes has until recently been limited to ground-based radar measurements during IPY, showing that the lakes A and B were not distinct lakes at the time of the measurement (January, 2009) and may have drained recently. In order to fill the significant data gap over the Recovery catchment identified by the BEDMAP2 project, over 29,000 line km of new radio-echo sounding, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetic data were acquired using a British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter during the IceGRAV 2012-13 field season. Here, we present a subset of this Recovery Frontier dataset in the vicinity of the giant Recovery lakes A and B to assess their current conditions. Bed reflectivity derived for a range of englacial attenuation rates indicates that the lake surface has larger reflectivity than the adjacent grounded areas, by more than 10 dB. Bed reflectivity varies little over short distances (< 1 km), both around the lakes and adjacent areas. Hydraulic potential varies little over the lakes as well as their downstream sides but increases in the upstream directions. These recent characteristics are clearly distinct from the previous ground-based measurements taken in 2009. We hypothesize that these differences indicate that lakes A and B may be filling. The existence of a major active hydrological system in the interior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet could influence ice streaming also further downstream, where smaller-scale active lake systems have been inferred.",

            "abstract": "The movement of contaminant plumes in underground aquifers is highly dependent on many hydrogeological parameters. We model the transport with an advection, diffusion, reaction system requiring the specification of porosity, flow direction, flow speed, dispersivities, and effects of geochemical reactions. It is often prohibitively expensive or impossible to make accurate and reliable measurements of these parameters in the field. It is also difficult to know the position and shape of a contaminant plume at a given time or the exact details of the source of the contamination, e.g. size, location, origin time, and magnitude. If decisions are to be made regarding contaminant remediation strategies or predictions of future contaminant concentrations in and near water-supply wells, then these uncertain hydrogeological and source parameters need to be analyzed and estimated. We utilize a measure-theoretic framework to formulate and solve the physics-based stochastic inverse problem to quantify the uncertainty for these parameters.\nWe solve the model using both analytical and finite element solutions. We define quantities of interest (QoI) for the groundwater contaminant problem in terms of observable field measurements. We develop adjoint problems to compute accurate and reliable a posteriori error estimates of the QoIs. The adjoint solutions are also useful in the solution of the inverse problem. The measure-theoretic formulation and solution of the inverse problem and modeling framework define a solution as a probability measure on the parameter domain. In the typical case where the number of output quantities is less than the number of parameters, the inverse of the map from parameters to data defines a type of generalized contour map where the geometry plays a pivotal role in determining an optimal set of QoI. We determine and analyze solutions for geometrically distinct QoI defining reduced-dimension set-valued inverses for this measure-theoretic inverse framework.",

Following community input from a real-time GNSS data products and formats meeting hosted by UNAVCO in Spring of 2011, UNAVCO now provides real-time PPP positions, and network solutions where practical, for all available stations using Trimble’s PIVOT RTX server software and TrackRT.\nThe UNAVCO real-time system has the potential to enhance our understanding of earthquakes, seismic wave propagation, volcanic eruptions, magmatic intrusions, movement of ice, landslides, and the dynamics of the atmosphere. Beyond the ever increasing applications in science and engineering, RT-GNSS has the potential to provide early warning of hazards to emergency managers, utilities, other infrastructure managers, first responders and others. Upgrades to the network include eight Trimble NetR9 GNSS receivers with GLONASS and receiver-based RTX capabilities and sixteen new co-located MEMS based accelerometers. These new capabilities will allow integration of GNSS and strong motion data to produce broad-spectrum waveforms improving Earthquake Early Warning systems.\nControlled outdoor kinematic and static experiments provide a useful method for evaluating and comparing real-time systems. UNAVCO has developed a portable low-cost antenna actuator to characterize the kinematic performance of receiver- and server-based real-time positioning algorithms and identify system limitations. We have performed tests using controlled 1-d antenna motions and will present comparisons between these and other post-processed kinematic algorithms including GIPSY-OASIS and TRACK. In addition to kinematic testing, long-term static testing of Trimble’s RTX service is ongoing at UNAVCO and will be used to characterize the stability of the position time-series produced by RTX.\nIn addition, with the goal of characterizing stability and improving software and higher level products based on real-time and high frequency GNSS time series, we present an overview of the UNAVCO RT-GPS system, a comparison of the UNAVCO generated real-time, static and community data products, and an overview of available common data sets.",

            "abstract": "Ozone is a species of major importance in the Martian atmosphere e.g. since it is involved in the stabilization of Mars' major atmospheric constituent carbon dioxide. Below XX km altitude, ozone acts as an atomic oxygen source, which is produced by photolysis and oxidizes carbon monoxide via catalytic cycles involving odd hydrogen (HO$_x$=H+OH+HO$_2$). Originating mainly from H$_2$O photolysis, odd hydrogen destroys ozone resulting in the observed anti-correlation between water vapor and ozone. Compared with species from the HO$_x$-family, ozone is relatively easy to detect by e.g. UV spectroscopy or IR heterodyne spectroscopy. Similar to carbon dioxide, the concentration of ozone can be critically influenced by chemical trace species acting as catalysts in chemical pathways. The identification of such chemical pathways in complex reaction networks and the quantification of their contribution is in general challenging. Therefore, we use an automated computer algorithm (PAP - Pathway Analysis Program), which is specifically designed to address such problems.\nIn this work, we apply the PAP-algorithm to the results of the newly updated JPL/Caltech photochemical column model of the Martian atmosphere in order to investigate the Martian atmospheric ozone photochemistry. The efficiencies of individual ozone formation and destruction pathways are calculated for different atmospheric heights, by applying the algorithm to each vertical layer of the column model in turn.\nThe results of our investigations suggest that ozone is primarily produced by a Chapman-like mechanism, whereby atomic oxygen is produced by carbon dioxide photolysis instead of molecular oxygen photolysis. In the ozone layer at approximately 40 km altitude, ozone formation is chiefly dominated by a chemical pathway where atomic oxygen is supplied by vertical transport. Ozone consumption pathways involving ozone photolysis are most efficient except for a layer around 40 km altitude where the reaction between ozone and atomic hydrogen become more important. These findings are of particular importance to understand the dominating processes in Martian chemistry also in view of more complex modelling approaches.",

            "abstract": "Melt from mountain glaciers is contributing about one third to the sea level rise total, equal to the current contribution from the ice sheets, and this is likely to be the case for the next century. The GLIMS Glacier Database provides detailed and traceable information on glaciers that can be used by the modeling and assessment communities to estimate present and future contributions from glaciers to sea level.\nThere are currently two major collections of glacier outlines: the glacier database of the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) initiative, and the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI). The GLIMS database is rich in source metadata and contains time series for thousands of glaciers, while the RGI is a single snapshot in time and has less of the crucial metadata. However, the RGI has nearly complete global coverage, while the GLIMS database is currently at about 70% coverage.\nWorking with members of both the GLIMS and RGI communities, we have begun to merge the RGI database into an enhanced GLIMS Glacier Database and to provide tools for downloading glacier data in either the GLIMS or RGI data model. The result will be an improved glacier database compared to either of the inputs, which we are calling GLIMS 2. This contribution provides an update of this work, its challenges and estimated time line for completion.",

            "abstract": "Electron density profiles of the Martian ionosphere show that the dayside ionosphere can be divided into two regions, one controlled by diffusion where the electron density decreases exponentially with altitude, and one at lower altitudes in which electron densities follow the basic predictions of Chapman theory. Models and data generally place the transition between the two regions near 200 km, but measurements from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on Mars Express suggest that the transition occurs closer to 275 km. This altitude also marks the transition between the two MARSIS operational modes: the electron density above 275 km is determined from local plasma frequency measurements, while at lower altitudes it is obtained remotely from radio sounding. In this study we compare Mariner 9 radio occultation electron density profiles to the Němec et al. (2011) empirical model based on MARSIS data to evaluate the accuracy and biases of the MARSIS measurements. We investigate whether the Mariner 9 electron density profiles can be well described by the Němec et al. (2011) empirical model. We also identify the typical Mariner 9 transition region altitude, as measured by a change in scale height, to determine whether the transition at 275 km observed by MARSIS is a consequence of differences in the two MARSIS operational modes or is physically meaningful. The Mariner 9 radio occultation measurements of the Martian ionosphere have recently been digitized and reanalyzed and are ideal for our study because they extend as high as 400 km, spanning the transition region between the two MARSIS data types, while similar measurements from Mars Global Surveyor rarely extend beyond 200 km. Our findings will help resolve discrepancies between the two MARSIS data types and validate the MARSIS electron density measurements.",

            "abstract": "Hydrology is one of the most important triggering factors for slope destabilization. When a slope becomes unstable, cracks and fissures develop during slope deformation. These discontinuities affect both geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the slope. The crucial role of water flow, and especially the important role of preferential flow in unstable slopes, is generally recognized. However, in hydrological modelling, the unstable slope is characterized using static subsurface properties. The dynamic feedback between slope deformation and slope hydrology, being positive or negative depending on other geotechnical conditions, is not taken into account although it influences the pore pressure distribution and as such the overall stability.\nThis research aims to highlight and quantify the dynamic nature of the subsurface hydrological conditions in unstable slopes. We focus on the role preferential flow has on slope destabilization and more specifically on the feedbacks between differential displacement and hydrological behaviour of the subsurface in natural slopes.\nWe will present examples of field experimental work where we measured the hydrological influence of fissures, theoretical analysis and case study modelling of combined hydrology and slope stability, including feedbacks. The results show the subtle trade-off of increased infiltration and storage capacity in a slope and the increased drainage capacity of well connected preferential flow paths.\nWe will furthermore highlight the current status of our knowledge as well as identify the knowledge gaps we face and the importance of cross- and multidisciplinary approach to better understand the internal dynamics of slope deformation and hillslope hydrology.",

            "abstract": "Projected increases in global population will put enormous pressure on fresh water resources in the coming decades. Approximately 70 percent of human water use is allocated to agriculture with 40 percent of global food production originating from irrigated lands. Growing demand for food will only worsen the strain placed on many irrigated agricultural systems resulting in an unsustainable reliance on groundwater. This work represents an effort to improve the operability of the recently developed and promising cosmic-ray neutron method for estimating field-scale soil moisture. The cosmic-ray sensor passively measures above ground low-energy neutrons, which correlate to the amount of water within the measurement area (a circle with radius of ~300 m and a depth of ~30 cm). The sensor sees all forms of water (hydrogen), therefore time-varying water in growing biomass should be accounted for to reduce systematic measurement error and bias. Two vegetation indices were used to estimate fresh biomass within study agricultural fields near York, NE. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GRNDVI) were both calculated from MODIS 500 m resolution satellite reflectance data for the summer of 2014. Additionally, in-situ biomass samples were collected from study fields to compare to biomass estimates obtained from MODIS reflectance data. Preliminary results suggest that remotely sensed fresh biomass estimates collected over the course of a growing season were sufficient and accurate enough (~ within 1 kg/m2) to eliminate the systematic error in the cosmic-ray calibration method for both soybean and maize crops. The incorporation of this novel technique for soil moisture management in producer operations has the potential to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use.",

However, in these landscapes the ground may thaw up to a meter during summer, and microtopography on lake shores and ground ice gradients may promote subsurface flow. Using permeameter and infiltration tests coupled with lake water budgets, we test the hypothesis that subsurface flow may be an important component of arctic lake water budgets after the spring freshet. Water budgets incorporating only evaporation, precipitation, and stream discharge indicated substantial, unmeasured fluxes that varied in direction and magnitude in full and partially-drained lakes. We were able to successfully reproduce the observed fluxes with a model incorporating drainage from thawing soils, storm runoff, and lake edge evapotranspiration. Thaw drainage was the dominant flux in a full lake, and runoff and evapotranspiration became increasingly important in partially drained lake basins. Our results suggest that supra-permafrost flow is an important component of arctic lake water budgets that must be considered to accurately predict water, solute, and heat fluxes in a changing Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Despite its critical importance to global food security, approximately 60% of water used for agriculture is wasted each year through inadequate water conservation, losses in distribution, and inefficient irrigation. Therefore, in order to coordinate a strategy to accomplish the agricultural demands in the future we must maintain a stable global food and water trade while increasing crop yield and efficiency. This research aims to improve the operability of the novel cosmic-ray neutron method used for estimating field scale soil moisture. The sensor works by passively counting the above ground low-energy neutrons which correlates to the amount of water in the measurement volume (a circle with radius of ~300 m and vertical depth of ~30 cm). Because the sensor responds to different forms of water (sources of hydrogen), estimates of background water in the mineral soil and soil organic matter must be accounted in order to minimize measurement error. Here we compared field-scale estimates of soil mineral water and soil organic matter with readily available global datasets. Using the newly compiled 1 km resolution Global Soil Dataset (GSDE), we investigate the correlation between (1) soil mineral water and clay content and (2) in-situ soil organic material. Preliminary results of in-situ samples from forty study sites around the globe suggest the GSDE dataset has sufficiently low bias and uncertainty (~ within 0.01 g/g of water equivalent) to better isolate the soil moisture signal from the neutron count information. Incorporation of this dataset will allow for real-time soil moisture mapping of hundreds of center-pivots using the mobile cosmic-ray sensor without the need of time-consuming in-situ soil sampling. The incorporation of this novel technique for soil moisture management has the potential to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, introductory hydrology courses focus on hydrologic processes as independent or semi-independent concepts that are ultimately integrated into a watershed model near the end of the term. When an “off-the-shelf” watershed model is introduced in the curriculum, this approach can result in a potential disconnect between process-based hydrology and the inherent interconnectivity of processes within the water cycle. In order to curb this and reduce the learning curve associated with applying hydrologic concepts to complex real-world problems, we developed the open-access Modular Distributed Watershed Educational Toolbox (MOD-WET). The user-friendly, MATLAB-based toolbox contains the same physical equations for hydrological processes (i.e. precipitation, snow, radiation, evaporation, unsaturated flow, infiltration, groundwater, and runoff) that are presented in the companion e-textbook (http://aqua.seas.ucla.edu/margulis_intro_to_hydro_textbook.html) and taught in the classroom. The modular toolbox functions can be used by students to study individual hydrologic processes. These functions are integrated together to form a simple spatially-distributed watershed model, which reinforces a holistic understanding of how hydrologic processes are interconnected and modeled. Therefore when watershed modeling is introduced, students are already familiar with the fundamental building blocks that have been unified in the MOD-WET model. Extensive effort has been placed on the development of a highly modular and well-documented code that can be run on a personal computer within the commonly-used MATLAB environment. MOD-WET was designed to: 1) increase the qualitative and quantitative understanding of hydrological processes at the basin-scale and demonstrate how they vary with watershed properties, 2) emphasize applications of hydrologic concepts rather than computer programming, 3) elucidate the underlying physical processes that can often be obscured with a complicated “off-the-shelf” watershed model in an introductory hydrology course, and 4) reduce the learning curve associated with analyzing meaningful real-world problems. The open-access MOD-WET and e-textbook have already been successfully incorporated within our undergraduate curriculum.",

E-TEC intends to integrate the multi-disciplinary observations and is equipped with stations to monitor a wide array of factors of quake precursors, including seismicity, GPS, strain-meter, ground water, geochemistry, gravity, electromagnetic, ionospheric density, thermal infrared remote sensing, gamma radiation etc, and will maximize the value of the data for researches with the range of monitoring equipment that enable to predict where and when the next devastated earthquake will strike Taiwan and develop reliable earthquake prediction models. A preliminary study on earthquake precursor using monthly Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data before 2013/03/27 Mw6.2 Nantou earthquake in Taiwan is presented. Using the statistical analysis, the result shows the peak of the anomalous LST that exceeds a standard deviation of LST appeared on 2013/03/09 and became less or none anomalies observed on 2013/03/16 before the main-shock, which is in consist with the phenomenon observed by other researchers.

As a result, while scientific results may be highly relevant to society that relevance is operationally far from clear.\nThis paper explores the use of shared learning processes to bridge the gap between the evolving body of scientific information on climate change and its relevance for resilience planning in cities across Asia. Examples related to understanding uncertainty, the evolution of scientific knowledge from different sources, and data extraction and presentation are given using experiences generated over five years of work as part of the Rockefeller Foundation supported Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network and other programs. Results suggest that processes supporting effective translation of knowledge between different sources and different applications are essential for the identification of solutions that respond to the dynamics and uncertainties inherent in global change processes.",

We perform first principles molecular dynamics simulations over the pressure-temperature encompassing that of the early Earth, and compute the electrical conductivity via the Green-Kubo formula. The electrical conductivity of the liquid substantially exceeds that of crystalline phases at all conditions. We find that along isotherms the conductivity of silica liquid reaches a maximum near 40 percent compression, remarkably similar to the compression at which 5-fold Si-O coordination is most abundant. The conductivity decreases upon further compression. The conductivity increases rapidly with increasing temperature at all pressures. We explore the underlying physical mechanisms of the computed variations of conductivity with pressure and temperature and discuss the implications of our results for magnetic field generation in basal magma oceans.",

            "abstract": "In this study we investigate the climatic impact of urbanization, including both Urban Heat Island (UHI) and aerosol effects, over the Yangtze-Delta metropolitan clusters region of Eastern China, based on a series of simulations with prescribed land use/land cover and emissions of aerosols and their precursors for the 2000s and 1970s , respectively. We conduct simulations for each land use/land cover and emission scenario from 2006-2010 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, with online chemistry/aerosol and urban canopy models, at a 3-km grid spacing. Overall the model can reasonably capture the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation as well as the phase of precipitation diurnal cycle in summer. Simulations results show a very clear UHI effect, i.e. expanded urban surface decreases surface latent heat flux, increases sensible heat flux and PBL height, and reduces surface wind over urban areas, with a more significant change in summer. Aerosol has much less obvious impact on local surface heat flux and temperature, but shows more remote impacts downwind due to dispersion and transport of pollutants and aerosol-cloud interaction. Aerosol also has a larger impact on precipitation amount and areal coverage than UHI. While UHI increases precipitation over urban regions during daytime especially when the southeasterly monsoonal flow prevails, aerosol remarkably suppresses precipitation, especially for light to moderate rain events, and increases the frequency of dry days in the entire model region.

            "abstract": "In compressional and extensional settings, high-enthalpy geothermal systems and epithermal vein deposits are genetically linked to shallow magmatic reservoirs, overlying hydrothermal circulation cells, and structural meshes that permit vertical migration of fluids. In the Andean Cordillera of Central-Southern Chile, the nature of the relationship between tectonics and volcanism is the result of interaction between the crustal structures and the regional stress field. Between 37° and 46°S, the volcanic and geothermal activity is controlled by the NNE-trending, 1,200 km long LOFS, an intra-arc dextral strike-slip fault system, associated with second-order intra-arc anisotropies of overall NE-SW and NW-SE orientation. Although there is consensus that volcanism in this segment are controlled by the regional scale tectonic stress field, the structural controls on magma degassing and metal fluxing remains poorly constrained.\nThe goal of the study is to constrain the first-order controls on fluxes of noble metals (Au, Ag, PGEs), base metals (Cu, Zn, Pb) and metalloids (As, Sb, Se) along this segment. For this purpose we collected fumarole and thermal water samples from five selected volcanic-geothermal systems along the northern termination of the LOFS. The selected areas are characterized by the occurrence of surface manifestations and are located along NNE-oriented or NWN-oriented fault systems. In each location, the trace metal budget and isotopic composition of fumaroles and springs were constrained along with cations, anions and dissolved gaseous species.\nThe helium isotopic ratios of fumaroles, defined as R/Ra, range between 3.5 and 7.5 in the studied segment. High R/Ra, mantle-like signatures are associated with geothermal manifestations occurring along NNE-trending faults, whereas lower R/Ra values in NWN-oriented systems most likely represent mixing between mantle and crustal sources. Concentrations of Au, Cu and As are significant in selected geothermal wells along NWN-faults (1.5 ppb, 8 ppb and 25 ppm, respectively), while measured concentrations of PGEs in fumaroles are detectable (between 0.6 and 14 ppt of Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir) along both NWE and NNE-trending structures.\nThis study point out towards provide new insights about large-scale metal fluxing along an active intra-arc fault system.",

In three years of operation, we have increased in the diversity of applicant pool and selected participants, increased the number of inexperienced participants and made measurable impacts on the students’ perceptions of graduate school and Heliophysics careers, and produced research with significant scientific merit. We attribute the success of the program to our proactive recruitment of first and second year students, underrepresented groups, and students from small universities. Key factors in our efforts include: 1) In person school visits of targeted schools 2.) Establishing relationships with faculty at targeted schools. 3.) An inclusive selection process that considers the availability of research at the students home institution 4.) A reduced focus on GPA and more focus on recommendation letters as indicators of success 5.) A successful cohort of experienced and inexperienced students 6.)

            "abstract": "Agricultural production is heavily dependent not only on climate but also on markets as well as on the social and community systems managing the agroecosystem. In addition, the ultimate goal of agricultural production, human food security, is also affected not only by net agricultural production but also by similar economic and social factors. These complex feedbacks assume a particular importance in the case of smallholder farms in the tropics, where alternative rural development policies have led to different and contrasting agricultural management systems. Current approaches at comparing such systems generally study their environmental, economic or social components in isolation, potentially missing important interconnections.\nThis research uses a participatory systems dynamics modelling (SDM) framework to compare two small-scale agricultural approaches in rural Guatemala which differ in their social, economic and ecosystem management decisions. The first case study community, in Quiché, has adopted a subsistence-based system that aims to use low levels of outside inputs to produce food for their own consumption, while the second, in Sololá, has opted for market-based agriculture that uses high input levels to obtain marketable crops in order to assure income for the purchase of food and other necessities. Each of these systems has its respective vulnerabilities; while the Sololá community suffers from more environmental degradation issues (soils and pests), the Quiché community, given lower monetary incomes, is more vulnerable to events whose responses require a significant monetary expenditure.\nThrough the SDM approach, we incorporate local stakeholder knowledge of the respective systems, including biophysical and socioeconomic variables, into a joint biophysical and socioeconomic model for each community. These models then allow for the comparison of the resilience of both types of socio-agroecosystems in the face of climatic, economic and biological shocks, as well as for the participatory use of the models as decision support tools for the participatory design of sustainable solutions to the identified vulnerabilities in each system.",

            "abstract": "A large fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) is composed of small molecules of microbial origin resulting from lysed cells and released metabolites. However, the cycling of these nutrients by microorganisms, a critical component of the global carbon cycle, remains poorly understood. Although there are many biotic and abiotic factors affecting the accessibility of SOM to microbes, adsorption to mineral surfaces is among the most important. Here, we are developing exometabolomics methods to further understand the types of microbial metabolites remaining in the water extractable fraction of SOM (WEOM). To estimate which compounds adsorb to a sandy loam soil (obtained from the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in Mendocino, CA), an extract was prepared from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas stutzerii RCH2 grown on 13C acetate. This approach produced highly labeled metabolites that were easily discriminated from the endogenous soil metabolites by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Comparison of the composition of the fresh bacteria extract with what was recovered following a 15 min incubation with soil revealed that only 26% of the metabolites showed >50% recovery in the WEOM. Most cations (polyamines) and anions showed <10% recovery. These represent metabolites that may be inaccessible to microbes in this environment and would be most likely to accumulate as SOM presumably due to binding with minerals and negatively-charged clay particles. Ongoing studies are focused on comparing the adsorption capacity of bacteria extract with several minerals (ferrihydrite, goethite, meghemite, lepidocrocite). Varying conditions such as metabolite-mineral contact time (ranging from hours to days) and temperature (4-37°C) will provide insight into how microbial metabolites behave in a given mineral-rich environment under certain climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The formation of the most recent flood basalt province on Earth, the Columbia River Flood Basalts (CRBs) of the northwestern USA, was accompanied by eruptions of several thousand km3 of rhyolite in a short time window from 16.7 to 15 Ma. These rhyolites span from low (+1‰) to high (+11‰) in δ18O values as recorded by major phenocrysts, and alteration-resistant zircons within each rhyolite commonly display diversity of up to 6‰ δ18O, indicative of batch assembly prior to eruption. Significant variation in εHf also exists in zircons, ranging from -39 to 0 in rhyolites erupted through the North American cratonic crust, and from -1 to +9 in rhyolites erupted through accreted oceanic terranes to the east of the Sr87/86Sr = 0.706 line. This isotopic diversity cannot be accounted for by fractionation of a CRB-like parent magma, demonstrating that the syn-CRB rhyolites must have been derived from melting of the crust. Abundant low-δ18Omelt values among syn-CRB rhyolites further constrains this crustal melting to shallow depths of 5-10 km, due to the shallow depths of the necessary hydrothermal alteration of the protolith. By contrast, high-δ18O rhyolites must have been formed by remelting of sedimentary or metasedimentary rocks. Low-δ18O rhyolites are also most common in the vicinity of the crustal suture between the thick lithosphere of the Archean craton and the thin lithosphere of the accreted terranes. Thermomechanical modeling suggests that this contrast concentrates crustal heating and deformation, creating pathways for meteoric water to penetrate the crust and cause extensive hydrothermal alteration less than 1 Ma before those same rocks remelt to form low-δ18O rhyolites. Finally, we suggest that this extensive crustal hydrothermal alteration and melting may be typical of continental flood basalt provinces world wide, and particularly when there is syn-volcanic extension.",

            "abstract": "The logic tree scheme is the probabilistic framework that has been widely used in the last decades to take into account epistemic uncertainties in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). Notwithstanding the vital importance for PSHA to incorporate properly the epistemic uncertainties, we argue that the use of the logic tree in a PSHA context has conceptual and practical drawbacks. Despite some of these drawbacks have been reported in the past, a careful evaluation of their impact on PSHA is still lacking. This is the goal of the present work. In brief, we show that i) PSHA practice does not meet the assumptions that stand behind the logic tree scheme; ii) the output of a logic tree is often misinterpreted and/or misleading, e.g., the use of percentiles (median included) in a logic tree scheme raises theoretical difficulties from a probabilistic point of view; iii) in case the assumptions that stand behind a logic tree are actually met, this leads to several problems in testing any PSHA model. We suggest a different strategy – based on ensemble modeling – to account for epistemic uncertainties in a more proper probabilistic framework. Finally, we show that in many PSHA practical applications, the logic tree is de facto loosely applied to build sound ensemble models.",

            "abstract": "Within the past decade, a wealth of federal, state, and NGO-driven initiatives has emerged across managed landscapes in the United States with the goal of facilitating a coordinated response to rapidly changing climate and environmental conditions. In addition to acquisition and translation of the latest climate science, climate vulnerability assessment and scenario planning at multiple spatial and temporal scales are typically major components of such broad adaptation efforts. Numerous approaches for conducting this work have emerged in recent years and have culminated in general guidance and trainings for resource professionals that are specifically designed to help practitioners face the challenges of climate change. In particular, early engagement of stakeholders across multiple jurisdictions is particularly critical to cultivate buy-in and other enabling conditions for moving the science to on-the-ground action. I report on a suite of adaptation efforts in the southwestern US and interior Rockies, highlighting processes used, actions taken, lessons learned, and recommended next steps to facilitate achieving desired management outcomes. This includes a discussion of current efforts to optimize funding for actionable climate science, formalize science-management collaborations, and facilitate new investments in approaches for strategic climate-informed monitoring and evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The ability to quantify shoreline features on Earth has been aided by advances in acquisition of high-resolution topography through laser imaging and photogrammetry. Well-defined and well-documented features such as the Bonneville, Provo, and Stansbury shorelines of Late Pleistocene Lake Bonneville are recognizable to the untrained eye and easily mappable on aerial photos. The continuity and correlation of lesser shorelines must rely quantitative algorithms for processing high-resolution data in order to gain widespread scientific acceptance. Using Savitsky-Golay filters and the geomorphic methods and criteria described by Hare et al. [2001], minor, transgressive, erosional shorelines of Lake Bonneville have been identified and correlated across the basin with varying degrees of statistical confidence. Results solve one of the key paradoxes of Lake Bonneville first described by G. K. Gilbert in the late 19th century and point the way for understanding climatically driven oscillations of the Last Glacial Maximum in the Great Basin of the United States. Similar techniques have been applied to the Eberswalde Crater area of Mars using HRiSE DEMs (1 m horizontal resolution) where a paleolake is hypothesized to have existed. Results illustrate the challenges of identifying shorelines where long term aeolian processes have degraded the shorelines and field validation is not possible. The work illustrates the promises and challenges of indentifying remnants of a global ocean elsewhere on the red planet.",

            "abstract": "GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many scientists directly or through other projects such as R or QGIS to perform geoprocessing tasks. Thus, a large number of scientific geospatial computations depend on quality and correct functionality of GRASS GIS. Automatic functionality testing is therefore necessary to ensure software reliability. Here we present a testing framework for GRASS GIS which addresses different needs of GRASS GIS and geospatial software in general. It allows to test GRASS tools (referred to as GRASS modules) and examine outputs including large raster and vector maps as well as temporal datasets. Furthermore, it enables to test all levels of GRASS GIS architecture including C and Python application programming interface and GRASS modules invoked as subprocesses. Since GRASS GIS is used as a platform for development of geospatial algorithms and models, the testing framework allows not only to test GRASS GIS core functionality but also tools developed by scientists as a part of their research. Using testing framework we can test GRASS GIS and related tools automatically and repetitively and thus detect errors caused by code changes and new developments. Tools and code are then easier to maintain which results in preserving reproducibility of scientific results over time. Similarly to open source code, the test results are publicly accessible, so that all current and potential users can see them. The usage of testing framework will be presented on an example of a test suite for r.slope.aspect module, a tool for computation of terrain slope, aspect, curvatures and other terrain characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Dust is one of the most important aerosol sources, which cover the sky over Africa, the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, Middle East, and many other areas over the world. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of dust aerosols on regional climate, with a focus on the Sahel region where dust events frequently occur, by examining responses of the regional climate system to direct, semi-direct, and indirect aerosol radiative forcings in the UCLA AGCM in terms of the cloud, radiation, temperature, precipitation, and general circulation patterns. The 3D monthly GOCART dust data have been employed in two scenarios, representing more severe dust loadings during 1980s and less dust during 2000s, respectively. Offline simulations reveal that 1) dust direct effect could overshadow cloud forcing under heavily polluted case; 2) semi-direct effect may change the sign of dust radiative forcing, indicating that cloud forcing associated with aerosol semi-direct effect can exceed direct aerosol forcing; and 3) changes in radiative forcing associated with indirect effect are not very significant with increasing AOD. AGCM simulations show that aerosol indirect effect tends to act oppositely to the aerosol direct and semi-direct effects with a much smaller magnitude, and hence the direct and semi-direct effects play a dominant role in the overall climatic effect of dust aerosols over the Sahel region. Increased dust aerosols in the AGCM simulations in 1980s tend to draw the precipitation further in land, which reduces the precipitation in the south part of the rainfall band over Sahel Savanna area centered at 10 N, where precipitation is shifted to the north over Sahel and produced a dipole anomaly. Dust AOD seems to play an important role in the distribution of the precipitation over North Africa since aerosol is the only forcing in these two experiments. To examine the uncertainty regarding the role of dust in Sahel climate variability, the 3D monthly climatology of the GOCART and MATCH dust data has been employed, respectively, in another two experiments. Differences in the simulated precipitation due to the use of different aerosol data reveal that the responses of the regional climate to the aerosol forcing are sensitive to the aerosol optical depth and properties.",

            "abstract": "The Hawaiian Islands extend NW for 625 km from Lō‘ihi to Ka‘ula island. One anomalous feature cross-cutting the Hawaiian Islands is the Kaua‘i Ridge, a 165 km-long bathymetric high with three well-defined gravity highs. These gravity highs are centered under or near the islands of Ka‘ula, Ni‘ihau and Kaua‘i, and represent the cores of three shield volcanoes whose volumes decrease dramatically with distance from the axis of the Hawaiian Chain (Kaua‘i, 58 x 103 km3, Ni‘ihau x 103 km, Ka‘ula 10 x 103 km; Robinson and Eakins 2006). Ka‘ula Volcano, on the SW end of the Kaua‘i Ridge, is centered 100 km off the axis of the Hawaiian mantle plume. The volcano is capped by a small island, which is a remnant of a nephelinitic tuff cone. The cone contains abundant accidental bombs of lava (tholeiite, phonolite and basanite), peridotite and pyroxenite, and unexploded ordnance from US military bombing. Two JASON dives on the flanks of Ka‘ula recovered only alkalic lavas. Three stage of Ka‘ula volcanism have been identified from sampling the volcanic bombs and flanks of the volcano. These rocks were dated using 40Ar/39Ar methods for the basalts and K-Ar for the phonolites. A tholeiitic shield basalt yielded an age of 6.2 Ma, the oldest reliable age for any Hawaiian Island tholeiite. Post-shield phonolites gave ages of 4.0 to 4.2 Ma (Garcia et al., 1986) and rejuvenation stage alkalic basalts yielded ages of 1.9 to 0.5 Ma. These ages are nearly identical to those for the same stages for adjacent Ni‘ihau volcano but slightly older than on Kauai, 100 km to the NE (Sherrod et al. 2007). Thus, volcanism was nearly simultaneous along Kaua‘i Ridge. The new age results extend to 420 km the distance within the Hawaiian Islands that experienced coeval rejuvenated volcanism. Geochemically, the rejuvenated and tholeiitic lavas from the Kaua‘i Ridge are very similar with mixed source signatures of Loa and Kea trend compositions. Mixed Loa-Kea sources have been found for many other Hawaiian volcanoes. These results indicate that the Hawaiian mantle plume was broadly homogeneous over 100 km distance but also heterogeneous on a fine scale.\nGarcia et al., 1986. Contr. Mineral.

            "abstract": "Phobos’ low density of 1.876 ± 0.02 g/cm3 (Andert et al., 2010, Witasse et al., 2013, Paetzold et al., 2013) supports its formation from a disk of debris (Peale 2007). The disk would either be a remnant of the formation of Mars (Safronov et al., 1986) or the result of a collision between Mars and a large body (Craddock 1994, 2011; Singer 2007). Within this scenario a large interior porosity would be responsible for the low density of the re-accreted material forming Phobos. Thermal emission spectra of Phobos suggest an ultramafic composition with the presence of phyllosilicates and feldspathoids in some regions (Giuranna et al., 2011), consistent with Phobos’ in situ formation (Giuranna et al., 2011).\nHowever, the 0.3-4.0 μm surface spectra taken from multiple areas of the body in more than 43 years of observations (Duxbury et al., 2013), show physical characteristics similar to low-albedo asteroids such as C-type (Masursky et al., 1972, Pang et al., 1980) or D-type (Murchie 1999, Rivkin et al., 2002, Lynch et al., 2007, Pajola et al., 2012). They argue in favor of an asteroidal capture scenario that could be explained by binary asteroid dissociation (Landis 2009) or by collisional capture in the Martian orbital region (Pajola et al., 2012).\nFinally recent work by Schmedemann et al., (2014) indicates Phobos’ surface to be ~ 4.3 – 3.7 Ga, dating back to a period where there was an intensification in the number of impactors in the inner Solar System (Gomes et al., 2005), and supporting both the in-situ and the capture scenario.\nPajola et al. (2013) match the surface reflectance of Phobos from 0.4 to 4.0 μm with a mineralogical model composed of a mixture of Tagish Lake meteorite (TL) and Pyroxene Glass (PM80). Based on the published model, we adopted the weighted TL and PM80 densities to investigate if the low bulk density of Phobos could conform with these components reconciling both inner properties and surface spectra. While the TL density is available from measurements by Hildebrand et al. (2006), that of PM80 (Jager et al., 1994) has not been measured. In its stead, we have adopted density values of different pyroxene glasses from the literature (Karamanov and Pelino, 1999, and Smithsonian Physical Tables 1921) along with the density of mafic-rich glasses with VNIR spectra similar to PM80. We present our results.",

            "abstract": "The double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the east Pacific has been identified in previous observational studies in terms of time mean data, e.g. monthly mean fields. Little is known about the instantaneous occurrence of this feature. Here we use a new method for automated daily identification of convection associated with the east Pacific ITCZ in visible and infrared geostationary satellite images from 1980-2012. The method uses the satellite images to extract information about the spatial features of the clouds comprising the convergence zones. Features are then used as input to a temporal classification algorithm that is based on a combination of hidden semi-Markov model and support vector machine methods. Five ‘states’ are used to describe the location of the ITCZ: northern hemisphere only (nITCZ), southern hemisphere only (sITCZ), double ITCZ (dITCZ), ITCZ located directly on the equator (eITCZ), and no ITCZ present (aITCZ). Most of the year, particularly from May-Dec, is dominated by the nITCZ state. The boreal springtime is characterized by a high number of days classified as dITCZ, but the state of the ITCZ is quite variable during this time and can frequently transition between dITCZ, nITCZ, sITCZ, and aITCZ states. Our results will show ITCZ variability in terms of the different states on daily to interannual time scales. We will show how the large scale environment, including SST and atmospheric moisture availability, influences the occurrence of each ITCZ state, focusing on the dITCZ in the boreal springtime.",

            "abstract": "Wildfire can have complex effects on physical and chemical properties of soil and post-fire runoff. Water quality issues in the post-fire runoff may have caused catastrophic events in aquatic ecosystem in the Virgin River in Southwestern U.S. To examined the mechanisms of the impact of wildfire on post-fire runoff water quality, field sampling and experiments were conducted on surfaces of various fuel types at a burned site in the Virgin River Watershed. Rainfall simulation tests were performed to generate runoff for water quality test including in-situ DO and pH measurement and laboratory tests on a number of water quality constituents. Soil/ash samples collected from burned surfaces were applied in a laboratory test to produce solutions of different concentrations and DO changes over a 24-hour period were measured. Results confirmed that, for runoff carrying large amounts of sediment or debris, DO values can be substantially reduced to a level close to or lower than 5 mg/L. Fire effects may enhance this trend, but is not necessarily a critical reason for the reduction of DO levels.\nLaboratory runoff and soil sample analysis show that the post-fire runoff in this watershed may contain a large amount of ammonia (NH3 and NH4+). The concentration of ammonia can be higher than the lethal level to many (if not all) fish species. Fire effects appear to have a significant impact on the ammonia level, which lead to an increase of several times to one order of magnitude in the ammonia concentration in the runoff or soil solution under burned conditions. These results provide information to better understand post-fire water quality in this and similar watersheds.",

Here, we present a new numerical code developed to retrieve gas profiles of NO2 and HCHO using radiative transfer simulations. We present first results of such profiles from the MAX-DOAS station located at UNAM campus.\nThe code works in two steps: First, the O4 slant column density information is used to retrieve an aerosol profile. As an a-priori aerosol profile, we use averaged ceilometer data measured at UNAM and scaled to the total optical depth provided by the Aeronet data base. In the second step, the retrieved aerosol profile information is used together with the trace gas (HCHO or NO2) SCDs to retrieve the trace gas profiles.\nThe inversion is based on a gauss-newton iteration scheme and uses constrained least square fitting with either optimal estimation or Tihkonov regularization. For the latter, the regulation matrix is currently constructed from the discrete first derivative operator.\nThe forward model uses the radiative transfer code VLIDORT. The inputs to VLIDORT are calculated using temperature and pressure information from daily radiosounde measurements and aerosol single scattering optical depths and asymmetry factors from the Aeronet data base for Mexico City. For the gas absorption cross sections we use the same values as were used for the SCD calculation from the recorded spectra using QDOAS. Besides demonstrating the functionality of the algorithm showing profile retrievals of simulated SCDs with added random noise, we present HCHO and NO2 profiles retrieved from SCDs calculated from the MAX-DOAS measurements at UNAM campus at selected days.",

            "abstract": "Southern Alaska is a complex amalgam of tectonic environments, centered on the subduction/collision of the Yakutat Block with North America. Along the Aleutians in the west, the Pacific Plate subducts normally beneath North America, with a gradually shallowing subduction angle towards the Yakutat Terrane to the east. The western region of the Yakutat Block undergoes nearly flat-slab subduction beneath North America, whereas it transitions to collision in the northeast, which is the primary driver for the growth of the Chugach-St. Elias orogen. Farther to the east, the collisional system transitions to a transform boundary with the Fairweather-Queen Charlotte fault system.\nThe collisional system contributes to farfield tectonic effects in many regions, including northern Alaska and the Pacific Plate, but also combines with glaciation to drive sedimentation in the Gulf of Alaska. Glaciation has periodically increased in the St. Elias Range since the Miocene, but began dominating erosion and spurred enhanced exhumation since the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, at ~2.5 Ma. Results from IODP Expedition 341 show the first appearance of ice-rafted debris and a doubling of Gulf sedimentation at site U1417 at this age, and a major increase in sedimentation at ~1 Ma at sites U1417 and U1418. Glacigenic sediment flux into the Gulf of Alaska represents the majority of accumulation in the deepwater Surveyor Fan, and was the impetus for formation of the Surveyor Channel system.\nClimate events correlate to three major differentiable sequences across the Surveyor Fan that have been previously mapped using seismic reflection profiles. The change in morphology observed throughout the sequences allows us to characterize the influence that a glaciated orogen can have in shaping margin processes and the sediment pathways from source to sink. IODP Expedition 341 results allow us to now apply this method at higher resolution time scales (i.e., 100 kyr). We will explore changes in fan geomorphology observed in seismic reflection data to decipher changes in southern Alaska tectonics and climate, and to show the effect of those changes on deepwater sedimentary systems.",

            "abstract": "Current models still have large uncertainties in estimating the impacts of light absorbing aerosols on climate. Light absorbing aerosols can affect climate through radiative effects in both atmosphere and snowpack (hereafter atmospheric-effect and snow-effect, respectively). Both effects, to some extent, have been investigated in previous studies, but few have compared the two effects and their interaction with climate. In addition, most previous studies used models with relatively coarse spatial resolutions (1~2 degrees) that may not be able to resolve climate extremes and mountain snowpack. In this study, a state-of-the-art regional model, WRF-Chem, is coupled with the SNICAR model that includes a sophisticated representation of snow metamorphism processes for climate study. The coupled model is configured at a relatively high spatial resolution (0.25 degree) to simulate black carbon (BC) and dust concentrations in snow and their climatic impact over Eurasia for 2006-2010. The simulations are evaluated with various observations including some extensive field measurements over North China. In general, the model simulated spatial variability of BC and dust mass concentrations in the top snow layer (hereafter BCS and DSTS, respectively) are consistent with observations to within the uncertainty ranges of observations. BCS and DSTS introduce similar radiative warming in the snowpack, which is comparable to the magnitude of surface radiative cooling due to BC and dust in the atmosphere. The impact of BC and dust in the snowpack and in the atmosphere on the variability of regional hydrological cycle and temperature is characterized separately by sequentially “disconnecting” specific BC and dust forcing in the atmosphere and in the snowpack. This study represents an effort in using a regional modeling framework with a relatively high resolution to simulate BC and dust in snowpack and their climatic impact.",

            "abstract": "Rapid changes in slab geometry are typically associated with fragmentation of the subducted plate; however, continuous curvature of the slab is also possible. The transition from flat to normal subduction in southern Peru is one such geometrical change, where previous studies have suggested both tearing and continuity of the slab. The morphology of the subducted Nazca plate along this transition is further explored here using intraslab earthquakes recorded by temporary regional seismic arrays. Observations of a gradual increase in slab dip coupled with a lack of any gaps or vertical offsets in the intraslab seismicity suggest a smooth contortion of the slab. Concentrations of focal mechanisms at orientations which are indicative of slab bending are also observed along the change in slab geometry. The presence of a thin ultra-slow velocity layer (USL) atop the horizontal Nazca slab is identified and located. The lateral extent of this USL is coincident with the margin of the projected linear continuation of the subducting Nazca Ridge, implying a causal relationship. Waveform modeling of the 2D structure in southern Peru using a finite-difference algorithm provides constraints on the velocity and geometry of the slab’s seismic structure and confirms the absence of any tears in the slab. The seismic and structural evidence suggests smooth contortion of the Nazca plate along the transition from flat to normal subduction. The slab is estimated to have experienced 10% strain in the along-strike direction across this transition, compared to 15% strain across flat-to-normal transitions in central Mexico where the Cocos slab is likely torn.",

            "abstract": "The ecohydrological functioning of cloud forests is intricately linked to unique plant ecophysiological traits and processes that influence water fluxes at the plot to ecosystem scales. However, despite substantial gains in our understanding of cloud forest plant ecophysiology over the past decade, integration of water flux information from the leaf to the watershed scale is still lacking. We present a synthesis of research aimed at revealing the linkages between plant ecophysiology and forest ecohydrological functioning, conducted in a seasonal cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico. A variety of species-specific leaf-level water flux behaviors were found to influence various aspects of plant water relations, which in turn, scaled up to impact stand water balance. For example, foliar fog absorption compensated for approximately 9.3 ± 1.2% of transpiration, and nocturnal transpiration for dominant tree species during the dry-season accounted for 22% to 30% of daytime transpiration. Further, the presence of dense fog, light fog, and cloud cover was shown to reduce transpiration such that annual transpiration may increase up to 17% in the case that all fog occurrence is replaced by clear sky conditions. We discuss how these processes affect whole-plant and stand water balances, as well as the potential feedbacks of vegetation controls on hydrologic fluxes under future climate change. After placing our findings within a global context we present a conceptual model of the links between plant ecophysiological and ecosystem hydrological functioning in cloud forest settings. Finally, critical areas for future research are highlighted to further improve our understanding of the linkages between leaf- and ecosystem-level processes and fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Climate models with variable-resolution grids offer a computationally less expensive way to provide more detailed information at regional scales and increased accuracy for processes that cannot be resolved by a coarser resolution grid. This study uses the recently released version of the Model for Prediction Across Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A), consisting of a non-hydrostatic dynamical core and a subset of Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model atmospheric physics and Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) cloud fraction parameterization, to investigate the potential benefits of using increased resolution in an equatorial channel. The simulations are performed with an idealized aquaplanet mode using two quasi-uniform grids, with 30-km and 240-km grid spacing, and two variable-resolution grids spanning the same grid spacing range, one with a narrow (20S–20N) and one with a wide (30S–30N) equatorial channel.\nWe find that for the wider equatorial channel, there is a closer correspondence with the 30-km quasi-uniform simulation. Results show that increasing resolution in the Tropics impacts both the tropical and extratropical circulation. Compared to the quasi-uniform coarse grid, the narrow-channel simulation exhibits a stronger Ferrel cell and stronger updrafts in the middle of the updraft branch of the Hadley cell. However, the total atmospheric poleward energy transports are similar in all simulations. With the CAM5 cloud fraction parameterization, the cloud microphysics shows moderate resolution dependence. The channel simulations have similar peak ITCZ precipitation as the simulation with quasi-uniform 240-km grid spacing and are only about 10% larger than the quasi-uniform 30-km simulation. All simulations have a single ITCZ. The relatively small differences in mean global and tropical precipitation rates among the simulations are a promising result, and the evidence points to the equatorial channel being an effective method for avoiding the extraneous numerical artifacts seen in earlier studies that only refined portion of the Tropics.",

            "abstract": "The April 2014 Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake occurred in the Northern Chile seismic gap. This part of the subduction zone was believed to have not experienced a large earthquake since 1877. As part of an international collaboration the \"The Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC)\" network was installed in 2007 to monitor this region. As well as recording the 2014 Pisagua mainshock, the IPOC network was able to record the full foreshock and aftershock sequences, providing a unique opportunity to study the nucleation and rupture process of large megathrust earthquakes.\nAs most seismic activity occurred ~100 km offshore of the coastline, the onshore nature of the network only covers the rupture area to the east resulting in poor azimuthal coverage and hindering accurate depth estimation of seismic events. To improve the location accuracy of the Pisagua seismic sequences, we installed a temporary seismic network that was operative from 1 May 2014. The network comprised 12 short-period stations located in the coastal area between Moquegua and Tacna and three stations at the slopes of Ticsiani volcano to monitor any possible change in volcanic activity following the Pisagua earthquake.\nOur study focuses on the nucleation area, where part of the precursory sequence and a slow slip event occurred (Ruiz et al., 2014). This region became significantly stronger in the two weeks preceding the Pisagua mainshock. On 16 March 2014 the strongest foreshock (Mw 6.7) occurred offshore of Pisagua with a centroid depth of 10 km, shallower than the estimated subduction interface.\nIn this study aftershock locations are further constrained using observations from the new network installed in Peru. We carefully estimate event locations and we compute regional moment tensor solutions by 1-D full waveform inversion of the broadband data. To improve our solutions, we are currently relocating aftershocks, to correct for foreshock mislocations by using the double-difference earthquake location algorithm and including cross-correlation methods.",

Here we present tomographic images of the seismic structure of oceanic upper mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca (JdF) and Gorda plates derived from body wave delay times. The results constrain structural anomalies beneath the JdF and Gorda spreading centers, the Blanco and Mendocino transform faults, near ridge hotspots such as Axial Seamount, and the upper mantle structure beneath the subducting oceanic lithosphere. We measured delay times of teleseismic P and S wave phases for the first two years of the CI. Our tomographic analysis assumes both isotropic and anisotropic starting models and accounts for finite-frequency effects and three-dimensional ray bending. Preliminary results indicate that the upper mantle structure beneath the JdF spreading center is asymmetric, with lower shear wave velocities beneath the Pacific plate (also the direction of ridge migration). On a regional scale, regions of lower seismic velocities beneath the JdF and Gorda spreading centers correlate with shallower ridge depths. Beneath the southern Gorda plate a low velocity anomaly is detected, which is absent to the north; this anomaly is bounded to the south by the Mendocino transform. Ongoing work includes analysis of the third year of CI data, which will improve resolution of structure and allow better definition of anomalies in the vicinity of the Blanco transform. In addition, we will combine ocean and continental data to obtain images of the Cascadia subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Pseudotachylites are common in brittle deformation zones and represent rapidly crystallized melts produced by friction-induced heating, possibly associated with dynamic rupture and slip during earthquakes. Thus, pseudotachylites may provide insight into how such localized deformation occurs. Here, we investigated the micron to cm scale structure and geochemistry of granitic plutons in the Eastern Peninsular Ranges shear zone (California), which is a large scale thrust rooted in the lower crust. Our U-Pb chronology and Zr thermometry of sphene porphyroblasts in the mylonite indicate that the plutons were deformed at near solidus conditions (780-750 ◦C) between 89 and 78 Ma, which coincides with the last pulse of magmatism. This ductile deformation resulted in a foliated fabric defined by biotite-rich layers. Subsequent brittle deformation is superimposed on this ductile fabric as exemplified by pseudotachylites and ultracataclasites cross-cutting or parallel to the foliation planes. The pseudotachylites are characterized by a glassy matrix with microlites, and the ultracataclasites are characterized by a fine-grained matrix of angular mineral and rock fragments. We measured major and trace compositions of these brittle deformation products using LA-ICPMS. The pseudotachylites are more mafic (lower Si, but higher Fe, Ti and K) than the host granitoid, while the ultracataclasites are intermediate between the pseudotachylites and the host. The mafic compositions of the pseudotachylites indicate that they form almost solely by melting of biotite. The compositions of the ultracastaclasites also suggest preferential involvement of biotite, but with a greater component of feldspar.\nThe compositional discrepancy between the brittle deformation products and the host granitoid begs the question of why brittle deformation appears to preferentially involve biotite. One possibility is that brittle deformation occurred on weak zones inherited from the biotite-rich mylonitic foliation planes. Our observations indicate that such ductile deformation occurred at near-solidus conditions and may have been associated with the assembly of the Cretaceous magmatic arc. We suggest that brittle faulting inherits pre-existing ductile fabrics that, once formed, define long-lived weak shear zones in the crust.",

Prior attempts to use this relationship have always invoked additional terms to try to reconcile proton conduction and hydrogen diffusion data. However experimental data on hydrogen diffusion through the mineral lattice only constrain the rate of proton migration coupled with defects (such as vacancies) and not the diffusion of free protons. New diffusion experiments on olivine demonstrate that lattice diffusion is indeed highly dependent on the defect site where hydrogen is bounded but in any case is not fast enough to explain the observed laboratory proton conduction experiments. Effective diffusion, which combines lattice diffusion with the far faster grain boundary diffusion, explains both the laboratory results and also field observations, and yields an estimate of average grain size of 0.5-2 cm at 100 km below the Jagersfontein kimberlite field, consistent with petrological observations on xenolith material.",

            "abstract": "Automated baseline correction of strong motion data is of broad interest for regional earthquake source modeling and for rapid earthquake response. Strong motion data are typically high pass filtered before inverting for source properties, thereby eliminating any information on static deformation. High-rate (1 Hz) GPS data preserve the long period information, particularly the static offset, but the data are much noisier at higher frequencies. Through a Kalman filter algorithm we demonstrate that, when available, collocated GPS sensors provide sufficient information for suitable baseline corrections to the strong motion data; we call this the seismogeodetic solution. We discuss in detail the superior recovery of low frequency information using the seismogeodetic approach when compared to baseline corrected accelerometer waveforms. The GPS/accelerometer combination provides broadband motions from the Nyquist frequency of the accelerometer down to the static offset. Because Kalman filtering is a real time operation that does not require operator interaction, we conclude that this approach could provide input for broadband source modeling that could potentially be calculated shortly after large events. To illustrate the performance and usefulness of this algorithm, we conduct a kinematic slip inversion of the seismogeodetic data from collocated GPS/strong motion pairs in Japan for the 2011 Mw9 Tohoku-oki earthquake using three-component Kalman filtered displacements and velocities for a total of 288 waveforms. Such source models are key to understanding the earthquake rupture process and for guiding rapid response, especially for large events such as this one. We quantify the differences between the inversion results using seismogeodetic data compared to those using conventional approaches by assessing the fit to ground motions at independent stations in Japan. In addition, we compare tsunami inundation levels predicted by the different models with actual field surveys that were conducted after the event. We will summarize the benefits of GPS instruments that are collocated with strong motion accelerometers in regional monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) is shared by Egypt, Libya, Chad and Sudanand is one of the largest (area: ~ 2 × 106 km2) groundwater systems in the world. Despite its importance to the population of these countries, major hydrological parameters such as modern recharge and extraction rates remain poorly investigated given: (1) the large extent of the NSAS, (2) the absence of comprehensive monitoring networks, (3) the general inaccessibility of many of the NSAS regions, (4) difficulties in collecting background information, largely included in unpublished governmental reports, and (5) limited local funding to support the construction of monitoring networks and/or collection of field and background datasets. Data from monthly Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity solutions were processed (Gaussian smoothed: 100 km; rescaled) and used to quantify the modern recharge to the NSAS during the period from January 2003 to December 2012. To isolate the groundwater component in GRACE data, the soil moisture and river channel storages were removed using the outputs from the most recent Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5). GRACE-derived recharge calculations were performed over the southern NSAS outcrops (area: 835 × 103 km2) in Sudan and Chad that receive average annual precipitation of 65 km3 (77.5 mm). GRACE-derived recharge rates were estimated at 2.79 ± 0.98 km3/yr (3.34 ± 1.17 mm/yr). If we take into account the total annual extraction rates (~ 0.4 km3; CEDARE, 2002) from Chad and Sudan the average annual recharge rate for the NSAS could reach up to ~ 3.20 ± 1.18 km3/yr (3.84 ± 1.42 mm/yr). Our recharge rates estimates are similar to those calculated using (1) groundwater flow modelling in the Central Sudan Rift Basins (4-8 mm/yr; Abdalla, 2008), (2) WaterGAP global scale groundwater recharge model (< 5 mm/yr, Döll and Fiedler, 2008), and (3) chloride tracer in Sudan (3.05 mm/yr; Edmunds et al. 1988). Given the available global coverage of the temporal GRACE solutions for the past twelve years and plans are underway for the deployment of a GRACE follow-On and GRACE-II missions, we suggest that within the next few years, GRACE will probably become the most practical, informative, and cost-effective tool for monitoring the recharge of large aquifers across the globe.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the flow of rock deformed under eclogite facies conditions is crucial to constraint the dynamics of a subducting slab. Prograde metamorphism during burial in a subduction zone proceeds across several lithologies, resulting in heterogeneous eclogitization and potentially different processes. In order to explore the expression of such a variety in terms of a deformative fabric, we have analyzed texture and shape fabric of eclogites and eclogitic orthogneisses from the Malpica-Tui unit (NW Spain). We explore the same rock volumes with TOF-neutron diffraction (HIPPO @ LANSCE) and synchrotron microtomography (SYRMEP @Elettra). Orientation distribution functions were extracted after Rietveld refinement in MAUD and morphometric data (size, aspect ratio, orientation) were obtained after image processing with FIJI, Blob3D and MATLAB.\nShape fabric reflects the macroscopic foliation and lineation and correlates with texture. Garnet fabric is particularly important because of the rheological implications of its mechanical behavior. Garnet shows little elongation in both samples, and texture is significant, what probably points to a relatively dry deformative environment, with diffusion-assisted dislocation. This eclogites could represent a rigidification stage in the subduction channel preserved during the exhumation at high-P and high-T documented in the Malpica-Tui unit during the Variscan orogeny.",

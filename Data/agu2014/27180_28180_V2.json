            "abstract": "IPython has provided terminal-based tools for interactive computing in Python since 2001. The notebook document format and multi-process architecture introduced in 2011 have expanded the applicable scope of IPython into teaching, presenting, and sharing computational work, in addition to interactive exploration. The new architecture also allows users to work in any language, with implementations in Python, R, Julia, Haskell, and several other languages.\nThe language agnostic parts of IPython have been renamed to Jupyter, to better capture the notion that a cross-language design can encapsulate commonalities present in computational research regardless of the programming language being used. This architecture offers components like the web-based Notebook interface, that supports rich documents that combine code and computational results with text narratives, mathematics, images, video and any media that a modern browser can display. This interface can be used not only in research, but also for publication and education, as notebooks can be converted to a variety of output formats, including HTML and PDF.\nRecent developments in the Jupyter project include a multi-user environment for hosting notebooks for a class or research group, a live collaboration notebook via Google Docs, and better support for languages other than Python.",

            "abstract": "Air pollutants (SLCPs) such as tropospheric ozone and aerosols are mainly affected by meteorological variables and emissions. East Asia is one of important source regions of both anthropogenic and natural air pollutants and GHGs. Therefore, significant environmental changes are expected in the future and air quality modeling is the important methodology to quantitatively evaluate them. Multiple emission inventories with various spatio-temporal resolutions are necessary in support of many different air quality modeling and future climate chage researches. Many emission inventories have been developed for Asia and for Globe, such as TRACE-P, INTEX, REAS, CREATE, MICS-Asia, HTAP, SRES, RCP. Those inventories have been successfully used for many international researches, but also have several limitations including relatively old base year, limited number of pollutants/types, and low transparency of sector/fuel information. Understanding discrepancies and similarities among those intentories would give us a better insights to understand not only present status regional emissions amounts but structures of society and policy that link to the future emissions. To understand these, we; 1) selected several base-year bottom-up anthropogenic emission inventories over East Asia, 2) inter-compare emission inventories with more comprehensive sector/fuel classification, 3) explorer emissions change with more updated acvities, emission factors, and control options. The tentative results show that more than 50% of emission amount could be differ by inventory selection and more than 30% of emissions could be changed by emissions factor and/or control options. More findings regarding to these objectives will be presented on site",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) executed science observations in lunar orbit spanning 2013-Oct-16– 2014-04-18 UT. LADEE’s Ultraviolet/Visible Spectrometer (UVS) studies the composition and temporal variations of the tenuous lunar exosphere and dust environment, utilizing two sets of optics: a limb-viewing telescope, and a solar-viewer. The limb-viewing telescope observes illuminated dust and emitting gas species while the Sun is just behind the lunar limb. The solar viewer, with its diffuser, allows UVS to also stare directly at the solar disk as it approaches the limb, sampling progressively lower exosphere altitudes.\n Solar viewer “Occultation” activities occur at the lunar sunrise limb, as the LADEE spacecraft passes into the lunar night side, facing the Sun (the spacecraft orbit is near-equatorial retrograde). A loss of transmission of sunlight occurs by the occultation of dust grains along the line-of-sight [1, 2].\nSo-called “Inertial Limb” activities have the limb-viewing telescope pointed at the lit exosphere just after the Sun has set. Inertial Limb activities follow a similar progression of diminishing sampling altitudes but hold the solar elongation angle constant so the zodiacal light contribution remains constant while seeking to observe the weak lunar horizon glow [2,3,4].\nOn the dark side of the moon, “Sodium Tail” activities pointed the limb-viewing telescope in the direction of the Moon’s sodium tail (~anti-sunward), during different lunar phases. Of the UVS data sets, these show the largest excess of scattered blue light, indicative of the presence of small (~100 nm) dust grains in the tail. Correlations are sought between dust in the sodium tail and meteor streams [5] and magnetotail [3] crossings to investigate impact- versus electrostatic-lofting [6]. Once lofted, nanoparticles can become charged and picked up by the solar wind [7,8].\nThe LADEE UVS Occultation, Inertial Limb, and Sodium Tail spectral datasets provide evidence of a lunar dust exosphere.\n[1] Wooden et al. 2014, LPSC 45, 2123 [2] Wooden et al.

            "abstract": "The dynamics governing the upper ocean at submeso to meso scales (~1-300 km) are a topic of recent debate. Horizontal wavenumber spectra of kinetic energy (KE) estimated from satellite data and global models rolloff as k-2 which have been interpreted as evidence for surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) turbulence. Shipboard ADCP observations in the Gulf Stream, however, indicate steeper (k-3) KE spectra in the 20-200 km range and a ratio of across to along-track KE components of ~3, consistent with quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence. We use 13 years of shipboard ADCP measurements, altimeter data, and a new internal-tide-resolving and submesoscale-admitting Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) simulation to study the horizontal scales of variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in Drake Passage. Horizontal wavenumber spectra of KE in the 10-200 km range from Drake Passage ADCP observations rolloff as k-3, reminiscent of QG turbulence. The average ratio of the KE components, however, is <2. Analyses of the MITgcm numerical simulation and stochastically-generated vector velocity fields suggest that the presence of ageostrophic, horizontally-divergent motions significantly alters the QG spectral characteristics, in qualitative agreement with the ADCP KE spectra. Ageostrophic flows, likely dominated by internal tides, appear to project onto scales as large as 150 km but are more dramatic in the 10-40 km subrange where the KE component ratio is ~1. The simplest interpretation consistent with the available data is one of QG turbulence co-existing and interacting with unbalanced motions to generate the observed upper-ocean KE spectrum in the 10-200 km range. We find no signature of SQG turbulence.",

            "abstract": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP (S-NPP) has been providing daily global observations of the Earth surface since early 2012. With the decade-long observations made by MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua, one of the goals of the S-NPP mission is to provide continuity in producing land products that have been generated using heritage MODIS observations. The Land Data Operational Products Evaluation (LDOPE) team uses MODIS-derived products to evaluate land products obtained from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements generated through the Land Product Evaluation and Analysis Tool Element (LPEATE). However, due to inherent differences in their observation methods and the corresponding algorithms and post-processing techniques, the products generated from MODIS and VIIRS retain some discrepancies. Amongst all the differences between the two wide-swath radiometers, this study aims at analyzing the impact of differences in the corresponding spatial sampling. In particular, the VIIRS unique sampling scheme can introduce relative biases when comparing products (or observations) obtained from the two sensors. We use Landsat-8’s Operational Land Imager (Level-1T data) scenes acquired within a set of 10 x 10 degree, i.e., “Golden tiles” (used for evaluation purposes by LDOPE) to examine how the discrepancies in the spatial responses manifest in measured radiances on a daily basis (for 16 days). The (band-detector averaged) prelaunch Line Spread Functions (LSFs) were used to represent spatial responses for each sensor. Although the impact of differences in sensors’ spatial responses depends heavily on the spatial heterogeneity of a region-of-interest, the initial results, on average, indicate up to 0.8% and 5% difference (at the swath level) in the TOA radiances and TOA-based NDVI, respectively. The disparity (calculated for three sample scenes collected over the Golden sites) differs for different days (orbital configurations) and for different MODIS sampling sizes (500 m versus 1000 m). In other words, the plots of difference-in-scan-angle versus spatial-response show different trends for the MODIS land and ocean channels. For this ongoing study, the impact of gridding and differences in the spectral response functions will also be investigated.",

            "abstract": "The framework for treating luminescence signals within quartz as leaky and saturating thermochronometers has been put on a sound theoretical footing but requires further empirical exploration of kinetic mechanisms. Expanding treatment of K-feldspar as a low-temperature OSL thermochronometer is desirable as it exhibits higher luminescence sensitivity and often saturates at higher radiation doses than does quartz. This study considers thermal charge eviction dynamics for the IRSL sensitive trap within K-feldspar for different cooling rates and various present-day temperatures. Arrhenius parameters are calculated, and a simple kinetic model is used to predict the thermal evolution of the main IRSL trap in typical geologic settings. Effective closure temperature is found to be lower than 50 ºC for samples cooling at 10 ºC/Ma. Such low temperatures make K-feldspar luminescence thermochronology a promising complement to apatite (U-Th)/He techniques, which exhibit closure temperatures of about 60-80 ºC for the same cooling rate. We examine the various luminescence signals from K-feldspar within recently-exhumed bedrock samples from an uplifted block within the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California, USA. These signals suggest a recent decrease in topographic relief for the Yucaipa Ridge Block.",

            "abstract": "EcoSAR is a new airborne synthetic aperture radar imaging system, developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. It is a P-band sensor that employs a non-conventional and innovative design. The EcoSAR system was designed as a multi-disciplinary instrument to image the 3-dimensional surface of the earth from a single pass platform with two antennas. EcoSAR’s principal mission is to penetrate the forest canopy to return vital information about the canopy structure and estimate biomass. With a maximum bandwidth of 200 MHz in H and 120 MHz in V polarizations it can provide sub-meter resolution imagery of the study area. EcoSAR’s dual antenna, 32 transmit and receive channel architecture provides a test-bed for developing new algorithms in InSAR data processing such as single pass interferometry, full polarimetry, post-processing synthesis of multiple beams, simultaneous measurement over both sides of the flight track, selectable resolution and variable incidence angle. The flexible architecture of EcoSAR will create new opportunities in radar remote sensing of forest biomass, permafrost active layer thickness, and topography mapping.\nEcoSAR’s first test flight occurred between March 27th and April 1st, 2014 over the Andros Island in Bahamas and Corcovado and La Selva National Parks in Costa Rica. The 32 channel radar system collected about 6 TB of radar data in about 12 hours of data collection. Due to the existence of radio and TV communications in the operational frequency band, acquired data contains strong radar frequency interference, which had to be removed prior to beamforming and focusing. Precise locations of the antennas are tracked using high-rate GPS and inertial navigation units, which provide necessary information for accurate processing of the imagery. In this presentation we will present preliminary imagery collected during the test campaign, show examples of simultaneous dual track imaging, as well as a single pass interferogram. The interferometric product will be compared against existing DEMs for quality assessment.",

We obtained SHRIMP-RG 206Pb/238U ages of zircons from 7 intrusions in Georgia, USA, and are conducting a detailed study of the Danburg pluton (NE GA) to better understand the mechanisms leading to granite formation in the SAO. Magmatic 206Pb/238U zircon ages indicate a bimodal distribution of ages from ~342-321 in the Inner Piedmont and ~306-300 Ma in accreted Gondwanan terranes to the east, which is consistent with a growing database of U-Pb zircon ages. Ages of zircon xenocrysts, zircon δ18O values, and rare mafic enclaves support interpretations that these plutons derived from anatexis of older continental crust, with minor contributions from less-evolved sources. The Danburg Pluton and spatially-associated Sandy Hill ‘border facies’ intrude the Carolina terrane, and contain mafic enclaves that may represent a mantle contribution. The coarsely porphyritic, undeformed Danburg pluton is an I-type, magnesian, alkalic-calcic, metaluminous granodiorite to quartz syenite with ~63-73 wt. % SiO2. The equigranular, undeformed Sandy Hill pluton is an I-type, magnesian to ferroan, alkalic-calcic, peraluminous granite with ~72-75 wt. % SiO2. Whole rock samples from both intrusions show linearly-correlated major element trends, consistent with the two being related through crystal fractionation. The Danburg and Sandy Hill plutons yield indistinguishable 206Pb/238U zircon ages at the 2σ level (305.8±4.2 Ma and 301.1±3.6 Ma, respectively) with few xenocrysts. Premagmatic zircons with ages up to 335±6 Ma are inferred on the basis of age and zircon trace element chemistry. 206Pb/238U ages of titanite from three enclaves in the Danburg yield ages of 302.6±3.7 Ma, 311.7±6.1 Ma, and 312±11 Ma. Thus, all overlap the Danburg age (zircon) within 2σ uncertainty. Crystallization T’s calculated with Ti-in-zircon and Zr-in-titanite (at P = 0.3 GPa) thermometry are 717±69°C and 738±38°C (average±2 st.dev.). The age, temperatures, and textural evidence are interpreted to reflect quenching of mafic melt (enclaves) upon mixing with the coexisting felsic melt.",

            "abstract": "The vermetid benches or reefs are thick bio-constructions of marine shells of the Vermetidae group that thrive at sea-level and are used as proxy for crustal tectonic deformation, sea-level changes, paleoclimate reconstruction or paleo-Tsunami markers in different regions especially around the Mediterranean Sea. The Palm Islands Reserve located 5km offshore northern Lebanon in the Eastern Mediterranean, on the hanging wall of a submarine, active thrust fault – the Rankine-Abdeh fault – hold abundant vermetid bio-constructions that are still relatively well preserved. It is an exceptional site for testing and investigating hypothesis on the use of the vermetid benches. We surveyed the surface and shorelines of the Palm Island, the largest of the Islands. The fossil vermetid bio-constructions are present as uplifted benches on its northern side. Also, many of the large boulders mostly found on the south-western shore of the islands still hold vermetid bio-constructions originally from the intertidal position before the boulders were uplifted and thrown over the surface of the island away from the shoreline by powerful waves. Two continuous vertical sections of these bio-constructions, 7 and 13cm thick were sampled for radiocarbon dating. Of the 21 large boulders we surveyed 10 had their vermetid crusts sampled for 14C dating. Their measured radiocarbon ages are spread over many centuries and do not cluster around any single date that could correspond with that of a tsunami or storm event responsible for their transport. On another hand the radiocarbon ages from the uplifted benches show that the last co-seismic rupture of the underlying and offshore Rankine-Abdeh thrust took place after the 9th century AD and resulted in the tectonic uplift of the Palm Islands shoreline, by around 80cm. Interpretation of the morphology and ages of the vermetid bio-constructions found on the overthrown boulders suggest that another such co-seismic event happened towards the end of the 4th millennium BC. Finally two vertical growth rates of the vermetid bio-constructions were estimated for the Palm Island location around 0.049 cm/yr during the 6-9th century AD and 0.033 cm/yr during the late 4th millennium BC.",

            "abstract": "Indium is integral to modern electronic devices, and is an essential component in indium-tin oxide (ITO), an electrically conductive, and optically transparent material that forms the basis for touch screens and high-end LCDs. World-wide production of indium has increased almost seven-fold from 1990 to 2012. Continued increases in production can be aided by better models for the formation of indium-bearing ores, yet little is known about the behavior of indium in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. As a first step toward solving this problem, we performed experiments to evaluate the partitioning of indium between pyrrhotite (po) and silicate melt (m). Experiments were performed at 800 °C, 100 MPa, and fO2 ≈ NNO in a po-saturated, vapor-brine-rhyolite melt system for durations of 5 to15 days. Three separate series of experiments were conducted in which each series differed by the aqueous solution added. The first series of experiments were prepared with pure water, the second series of experiments with a 1.01 M chloride solution and the third series with a 0.35 M CuCl2-bearing starting aqueous solution. These changes in starting material produced changes in the composition of the run product po and glass. The partition coefficient D(po/m) for the pure-water series experiments is on the order of ≈ 10. The addition of chloride-bearing aqueous solution leads to a decrease in the partition coefficient to ≈ 1.5. The copper-bearing experiments yield a D ≈ 3. The lower values for D in the chloride-bearing experiments may be explained by indium-chloride interactions in the melt phase. Although the D does vary depending upon the composition of the starting aqueous solution, an order of magnitude estimate for D, for general modeling purposes, can be made by assuming a value of 4. By using reasonable estimates of the mass fraction of po that crystallizes in crustal magmatic systems, the proportion of indium sequestered by po, during fractional crystallization, can be evaluated. The results indicate that po sequesters less than 0.5% indium from a crystallizing silicate melt because of the small magnitude of the D, and low modal abundances of po. Experimental and modeling results indicate that crystallization of po alone cannot limit the capacity of a magmatic-hydrothermal system to yield an indium-rich ore fluid.",

The leading mode of CLC variability represents coherent variation, accounting for nearly 40% of the total CLC variance spanning 1950–2012. This leading mode and the majority of individual airports exhibit decreased low cloudiness from the earlier to the later part of the record. Exploring climatic controls on CLC, we identify North Pacific Sea Surface Temperature anomalies, largely in the form of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as well correlated with, and evidently helping to organize, the coherent patterns of summer coastal cloud variability. Links from the PDO to summer CLC appear a few months in advance of the summer. These associations hold up consistently in interannual and interdecadal frequencies.",

We argue that enhancing education in the field of ecohydrology, and therefore the science of ecohydrology itself, it is paramount to incorporate into the learning experience a better understanding of its origins, past experiences and the relationship with integrated water management in general. We provide a historical perspective on the field of ecohydrology and present case studies that show the importance of fusing ecohydrology and integrated water management.

            "abstract": "As the USArray Transportable Array entered the central and eastern United States, several Federal agencies (National Science Foundation, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Department of Energy) recognized the unique opportunity to retain TA stations beyond the original timeline. The mission of the CEUSN is to produce data that enables researchers and Federal agencies alike to better understand the basic geologic questions, background earthquake rates and distribution, seismic hazard potential, and associated societal risks of this region. The selected long-term sub-array from Transportable Array (TA) stations includes nearly 200 sites, complemented by 100 broadband stations from the existing regional seismic networks to form the Central and Eastern United States Network (CEUSN). Multiple criteria for site selection were weighed by an inter-agency TA Station Selection (TASS) Working Group: seismic noise characteristics, data availability in real time, proximity to nuclear power plants, and homogeneous distribution throughout the region. The Array Network Facility (ANF) started collecting data for CEUSN network stations since late 2013, with all stations collected since May 2014. Regional seismic data streams are collected in real-time from the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC). TA stations selected to be part of CEUSN, retain the broadband sensor to which a 100 sps channel is added, the infrasound and environmental channels, and, at some stations, accelerometers are deployed. The upgraded sites become part of the N4 network for which ANF provides metadata and can issue remote commands to the station equipment. Stations still operated by TA, but planned for CEUSN, are included in the virtual network so all stations are currently available now. By the end of 2015, the remaining TA stations will be upgraded. Data quality control procedures developed for TA stations at ANF and at the DMC are currently performed on N4 data. However, teleseismic and regional events are only picked a few times a month to fulfill data quality checks on the data. The assembled CEUSN data sets can be requested from the DMC with the _CEUSN virtual network code.\nAcknowledgments to Seismic Regional Network Operators: C. Ammon, J. Ebel, D. Doser, R. Hermann, A.

These data are used to investigate the microseism source directions and to determine the surface wave tomography of the Cascadia region. Spatial asymmetry in the amplitude of cross-correlations between receiver pairs is observed in both primary microseism and double-frequency (DF) microseism bands. This asymmetry indicates that there are preferential microseism propagation directions, either because of source location and/or upper oceanic crustal structure. Ambient noise group velocity tomography was determined from cross-correlation of DF microseisms between receiver pairs. A low-velocity region oriented roughly north-south was identified, apparently associated with a thick sediment zone off the continental shelf, reflecting the strong influence of ocean bottom sediment layer thickness on DF microseism propagation. The coherence of DF microseism signals between different stations was lowest in the low-velocity thick-sediment region, consistent with the thick sediment layer strongly affecting microseism signal propagation.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes induced by human activity have become a matter of heightened public concern during recent years. Of particular concern is seismicity associated with wastewater injection, which has included events having magnitudes greater than 5. The causes of the induced events are primarily changes in pore-pressure, fluid volume and perhaps temperature due to injection. Recent research in the US has focused on mid-continental regions having low rates of naturally-occurring seismicity, where induced events can be identified by relatively straightforward spatial and temporal correlation of seismicity with high-volume injection activities. Recent examples include events correlated with injection of wastewater in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Ohio, and long-term brine injection in the Paradox Valley in Colorado. Even in some of the cases where there appears at first sight to be a clear spatial correlation between seismicity and injection, it has been difficult to establish causality definitively.\nHere, we discuss methods to identify induced seismicity in active tectonic regions. We concentrate our study on Southern California, where large numbers of wastewater injection wells are located in oil-producing basins that experience moderate to high rates of naturally-occurring seismicity. Using the catalog of high-precision CISN relocations produced by Hauksson et al. (BSSA, 2012), we aim to discriminate induced from natural events based on spatio-temporal patterns of seismicity occurrence characteristics and their relationships to injection activities, known active faults and other faults favorably oriented for slip under the tectonic stress field. Since the vast majority of induced earthquakes are very small, it is crucial to include all events above the detection threshold of the CISN in each area studied. In addition to exploring the correlation of seismicity to injection activities in time and space, we analyze variations in frequency-magnitude distributions, which can be related to differences between the physical conditions at the sources of fluid-induced and natural earthquakes. While induced seismicity often does not show different mechanisms than tectonic earthquakes, an abundance of induced microseismicity causes the slope of the frequency-magnitude distribution to increase locally.",

            "abstract": "We address the fundamental questions surrounding the nature of water and chemical transport processes deep within sedimentary basin and accretionary-wedge environments.\nConsolidation and permeability studies conducted to 165 MPa (~10km depth) indicate that ultra-tight clay formations (10-18 m2 to10-21 m2) can substantially modify the fluids migrating through then. Pore-water extractions conducted on smectite/illite rich core samples obtained from 1-3 km depths at IODP (NanTroSEIZE, Chikyu) deep-riser drilling Site C0002, at the elevated loads required to squeeze waters from such deeply buried sediment (stresses up to 100 MPa),resulted in anomalous patterns of sequential freshening with progressive loading. More accurate laboratory investigations (both incremental loading and Constant Rate of Strain test) revealed that such freshening initiates above 20 MPa and progresses with consolidation to become greater than 20% by effective normal load of 165 MPa. Log-log plots of stress vs. hydraulic conductivity reveal that trends remain linear to elevated stresses and total porosities as low at 14%. The implications are that stress induced smectite dehydration and/or membrane filtration effects cause remarkable changes in pore water chemistry with fluid migration through deep, tight, clay-rich formations. These changes should occur in addition to any thermally induced diagenetic and clay-dehydration effects on pore water chemistry. Work is progressing to evaluate the impact of clay composition and temperature to ascertain if purely illitic compositions show similar trends and if the mass fractionation of water and other isotopes also occurs. Such studies will ascertain if the presence of smectite is a prerequisite for freshening or if membrane filtration is a major process in earth systems containing common clay minerals. The results have major implications for interpretations of mass chemical balances, pore water profiles, and the hydrologic, geochemical, and stress state controls on deep system behavior in all deep accretionary wedge and basin environments where clays are abundant.

            "abstract": "Most previous studies on the genesis and evolution of bedforms have focused on aggradational bedforms within cohesionless sediments, with very few investigations that concern either erosive bedform genesis and evolution or bedrock channel abrasion processes. The study presented here details experiments that involve the genesis and formation of erosional bedform features within natural (soft clay) cohesive sediment beds and analogue bedrock substrates by modelling clay under the effect of both open-channel plain water flows, and sediment-laden flows. A new approach without using plaster-of-Paris or real bedrock developed provides a feasible method to simulate the genesis and evolution of the erosional bedforms in cohesive sediment beds and sculpted forms in bedrock channels on relatively short time-scales in the laboratory by using a realistic substrate substitute.\nA series of flume experiments are presented herein where the undrained shear strength of two different kinds of substrate material is systematically varied under constant flow conditions. Experiments using plain water flow indicated that erosive bedforms in cohesive sediment substrate cannot be produced only under the effect of sediment-free flow. Particulate-laden flows do form erosional bedforms in both kinds of clay beds and the shear strength of the bed material plays a key role in determining the diversity of erosional features forming on such substrates. Optimisation of modelling clay beds has enabled us to successfully replicate a suite of bedrock bedforms, including potholes, flutes, longitudinal furrows, etc., that have clear equivalents to those observed in bedrock rivers and contributed to investigate the genesis and evolution process of them and explore the flow structures within and above them in experimental analogue bedrock substrate for the first time.",

            "abstract": "Operational earthquake forecasting (OEF) is the dissemination of authoritative information about time-dependent earthquake probabilities to help communities prepare for potentially destructive earthquakes. The goal of OEF is to inform the decisions that people and organizations must continually make to mitigate seismic risk and prepare for potentially destructive earthquakes on time scales from days to decades. To attain this goal, OEF must provide a complete description of the seismic hazard—ground motion exceedance probabilities as well as short-term rupture probabilities—in concert with the long-term forecasts of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. We have combined the Third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3) of the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (Field et al., 2014) with the CyberShake ground-motion model of the Southern California Earthquake Center (Graves et al., 2011; Callaghan et al., this meeting) into a prototype OEF system for generating time-dependent hazard maps. UCERF3 represents future earthquake activity in terms of fault-rupture probabilities, incorporating both Reid-type renewal models and Omori-type clustering models. The current CyberShake model comprises approximately 415,000 earthquake rupture variations to represent the conditional probability of future shaking at 285 geographic sites in the Los Angeles region (~236 million horizontal-component seismograms). This combination provides significant probability gains relative to OEF models based on empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs), primarily because the physics-based CyberShake simulations account for the rupture directivity, basin effects, and directivity-basin coupling that are not represented by the GMPEs.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical surveys are powerful tools for obtaining information about the subsurface. Inverse modelling provides a mathematical framework for constructing a model of physical property distributions that are consistent with the data collected by these surveys. The geosciences are increasingly moving towards the integration of geological, geophysical, and hydrological information to better characterize the subsurface. This integration must span disciplines and is not only challenging scientifically, but the inconsistencies between conventions often makes implementations complicated, non-reproducible, or inefficient. We have developed an open source software package for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (SimPEG), which provides a generalized framework for solving geophysical forward and inverse problems. SimPEG is written entirely in Python with minimal dependencies in the hopes that it can be used both as a research tool and for education.\nSimPEG includes finite volume discretizations on structured and unstructured meshes, interfaces to standard numerical solver packages, convex optimization algorithms, model parameterizations, and tailored visualization routines. The framework is modular and object-oriented, which promotes real time experimentation and combination of geophysical problems and inversion methodologies. In this presentation, we will highlight a few geophysical examples, including direct-current resistivity and electromagnetics, and discuss some of the challenges and successes we encountered in developing a flexible and extensible framework. Throughout development of SimPEG we have focused on simplicity, usability, documentation, and extensive testing. By embracing a fully open source development paradigm, we hope to encourage reproducible research, cooperation, and communication to help tackle some of the inherently multidisciplinary problems that face integrated geophysical methods.",

            "abstract": "Assessment of climate change resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation options require downscaling of GCM outputs to local scales, and conversion of temperature and precipitation forcings into hydrologic and ecological responses. Recent work in the San Francisco Bay Area, and California demonstrate a practical approach to this process. First, climate futures (GCM x Emissions Scenario) are screened using cluster analysis for seasonal precipitation and temperature, to select a tractable subset of projections that still represent the range of climate projections. Second, monthly climate projections are downscaled to 270m and the Basin Characterization Model (BCM) applied, to generate fine-scale recharge, runoff, actual evapotranspiration (AET), and climatic water deficit (CWD) accounting for soils, bedrock geology, topography, and local climate. Third, annual time-series are used to derive 30-year climatologies and recurrence intervals of extreme events (including multi-year droughts) at the scale of small watersheds and conservation parcels/networks. We take a “scenario-neutral” approach where thresholds are defined for system “failure,” such as water supply shortfalls or drought mortality/vegetation transitions, and the time-window for hitting those thresholds is evaluated across all selected climate projections. San Francisco Bay Area examples include drought thresholds (CWD) for specific vegetation-types that identify leading/trailing edges and local refugia, evaluation of hydrologic resources (recharge and runoff) provided by conservation lands, and productivity of rangelands (AET). BCM outputs for multiple futures are becoming available to resource managers through on-line data extraction tools. This approach has wide applicability to numerous resource management issues.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will provide soil moisture at 3, 9, and 36 km scales through the use of radar and radiometer data. To validate SMAP products, in-situ sensors are required. Typically, validation plans consist of several sensors installed nearly uniformly in the scene. To upscale the soil moisture estimates to the scales of SMAP products requires a large number of sensors, distributed throughout the instrument footprint. Even for the higher resolution SMAP products (3 km) there are often insufficient sensors available within a resolution cell.\nThe Soil moisture Sensing Controller and oPtimal Estimator (SoilSCAPE) project provides a new adaptive validation strategy, including upscaled estimates of soil moisture. By utilizing smarter network technology and optimized sensor placement, more representative measurements of soil moisture are obtained, at a range of spatial scales with lower costs than traditional networks. A large network was established around the Tonzi Ranch site in central California. The network design comprises multiple sites, each with a 10-30 node cluster taking measurements from up to 4 sensors installed at different depths. The nodes wirelessly communicate to a Local Coordinator, which collects data and transmits to a server (http://soilscape.usc.edu). Each node can communicate with the Coordinator up to a distance of 400m. Each station supports up to 60 nodes. Currently 111 nodes have been installed over 6 sites.\nThe SoilSCAPE nonuniform placement of sensors requires novel upscaling methods. Previous studies have used regression, which works well when the measurement is well correlated with other variables. However, soil moisture dependence on various variables could be complex and nonlinear. To account for such complexities, we use the Random Forests algorithm, which is capable of modeling complex non-linear system and can handle continuous and categorical data. The algorithm has not previously been applied to upscale estimates of soil moisture. Using AirMOSS P-band radar data and other data layers we describe a technique for upscaling in-situ soil moisture data from the SoilSCAPE network to a range of resolutions for the SMAP mission. The method and results will be presented, including the latest advances and enabling data products from SoilSCAPE.",

            "abstract": "In June 2012, the High Park Fire west of Fort Collins, CO burned 350 km2 of steep forested terrain, leading to elevated runoff and erosion in watersheds draining the burned area. Under the auspices of a NSF RAPID grant we began monitoring precipitation, hillslope-scale sediment production, stream stage, and channel geomorphic change in Skin Gulch and Hill Gulch, two 15 km2 watersheds within the High Park Fire. Short-duration summer thunderstorms are typically the dominant cause of post-fire runoff and erosion in the central and southern Rocky Mountains, but in September 2013 an extreme, long duration storm dropped more than 200 mm of rain in 48 hours. This storm provided a unique opportunity to compare the hydrologic and geomorphic effects of smaller summer thunderstorms to those of the long duration, high magnitude September event. Mean June-August 2013 precipitation in these watersheds was 125 mm, less than half the total for the September 2013 event, but this summer precipitation led to a mean sediment yield of 8 Mg ha-1, about double the mean sediment yield of the much larger September storm. Hillslope sediment production was highest during summer storms that were shorter duration but had higher 5-15 minute precipitation intensities than the September storm. These localized summer 2013 storms led to flashy pulses of flow in the channel network that caused relatively small amounts of channel aggradation or incision. In contrast, the September 2013 event produced sustained high flows that led to substantial geomorphic change throughout the channel network, with more than 2 m of aggradation at the outlet of Skin Gulch. These results indicate that the high intensity summer thunderstorms were most effective at mobilizing sediment from hillslopes, but the more spatially uniform rainfall during the September event produced much more dramatic downstream channel geomorphic change.",

In order to constrain the core compositions of those bodies from observed and future-planned seismic data, sound velocity and density of the core material, i.e., liquid Fe-alloy, are necessary. In this study, we have performed simultaneous measurements on these physical properties of liquid Fe-Ni–Si alloys, which is one of the major candidates for the core constituent. The effects of pressure and Si content on these properties were studied.\nHigh pressure experiments were performed using 80-ton uniaxial press designed for CT measurement or 180-ton cubic type multi-anvil press installed at BL20XU and BL22XU beamlines of SPring-8 synchrotron facility, respectively. Used samples were Fe-Ni-Si with Si content of 10-30 at%. The sample pellet was sandwiched by the single crystal sapphire buffer rod for sound velocity measurement. P-wave sound velocity was measured using pulse-echo overlapping ultrasonic method. LiNbO3 transducer was attached to the backside of the anvil to generate and receive elastic wave signals. Density was determined based on 3D volume data obtained from CT measurement or X-ray absorption profile.\nThe P-wave velocity (VP) and density of liquid Fe-Ni-Si were successfully measured up to 2.5 GPa and 1773 K. Obtained VP of the Fe-Ni-Si is found to increase rapidly with pressure below 1 GPa and increase gradually above 1 GPa. It is also found that VP increases slightly with Si content on the density-VP plot. These trends provide a constraint on the core composition of the planets and moon by comparing with observed data.",

With the recent advances in miniaturized radar and CubeSat/SmallSat technologies, it would now be feasible to launch multiple copies of the same radar instrument in desirable formations to allow measurements of short time scale evolution of atmospheric processes. One such concept is the novel radar architecture compatible with the 6U CubeSat class that is being developed at JPL by exploiting simplification and miniaturization of the radar subsystems. The RaInCube architecture would significantly reduce the number of components, power consumption and mass with respect to existing spaceborne radars. The baseline RaInCube instrument configuration would be a fixed nadir-pointing profiler at Ka-band with a minimum detectable reflectivity better than +10 dBZ at 250m range resolution and 5 km horizontal resolution.\nThe low cost nature of the RaInCube platform would enable deployment of a constellation of identical copies of the same instrument in various relative positions in LEO to address specific observational gaps left open by the current missions that require high-resolution vertical profiling capability. A constellation of only four RaInCubes would populate the precipitation statistics in a distributed fashion across the globe and across the times of day, and therefore, would enable substantially better sampling of the diurnal cycle statistics.\nOne could extend this scheme by adding more RaInCubes in each of the orbital planes, and phase them once in orbit so that they would be separated by an arbitrary amount of time among them. Wide separations (say 20-30 min) would further extend the sampling of the diurnal cycle to sub-hourly scales. Narrower time separations between RaInCubes would allow studying the evolution of convective systems at the convective time scale in each region of interest and would reveal the dominant modes of evolution of each corresponding climatological regime.\nA constellation of RaInCubes would also be a natural complement to other resources aiming at monitoring the evolution of weather systems, for example the Geostationary IR/VIS imagers, the NEXRAD network, and the GPM constellation.",

            "abstract": "Dry wells are gravity-fed, excavated pits with perforated casings used to facilitate stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge in areas comprised primarily of impermeable surfaces or low permeability soils. Stormwater runoff that would otherwise be routed to streams or drains in urban areas is used as a source of aquifer recharge. However, the potential for groundwater contamination caused by urban runoff bypassing surface soil filtration has prevented more widespread use of dry wells as a recharge mechanism. We present the results of a literature survey to assess the potential of dry wells for safe stormwater recharge. Dry wells have been inculpated in groundwater contamination events, although accusations were typically not backed by scientific data. In 1989 groundwater in Modesto, CA, was contaminated with tetrachloroethylene from a dry cleaning facility. The city had been using dry wells to manage stormwater for more than 50 years without detrimental impacts before the contamination. A USGS monitoring study proved that the contamination was from sewer system leakage, and did not involve the dry wells. Some areas of the country have used dry wells with positive results. The Underground Injection Control system (UICs) study in Portland, OR, has been active for ten years, and currently operates over 9,000 UICs. Initially, a ten foot separation distance was enforced between the seasonal high water table and the bottom perforation of the UIC; however, due to monitoring and modeling results that indicate the protectiveness of groundwater, this distance has been reduced to zero feet. Future work will include a comparative pilot study involving a residential and an industrial site in Elk Grove, CA. The study will use modeling tools to assess the recharge potential and groundwater protectiveness of dry wells. Both sites are outfitted with four monitoring wells each: an upgradient monitoring well, two downgradient monitoring wells, and a vadose zone monitoring well. The results of water quality sampling will determine the contaminants of interest, and a model of the fate and transport of these contaminants in the vadose zone will be coupled with hydraulic models to estimate the response of the hydrogeologic system to dry well recharge, with the goal of creating a tool that can be used to evaluate future dry well locations.",

            "abstract": "Recent trends and projections for future change for the U.S. northern forests suggest that the region’s climate is becoming warmer, wetter, and, ironically, drier, with more precipitation occurring as large events, separated by longer periods with no precipitation. However, to date, precipitation manipulation experiments conducted in forest ecosystems represent only ~5% of all such experiments worldwide, and our understanding of how the mesic-adapted northern forest will respond to greater frequency and intensity of drought in the future is especially poor. Several important challenges have hampered previous research efforts to conduct forest drought experiments and draw robust conclusions, including difficulties in reducing water uptake by deep and lateral tree roots, logistical and financial constraints to establishing and maintaining large-scale field experiments, and the lack of standardized approaches for determining the appropriate precipitation manipulation treatment (e.g., amount and timing of throughfall displacement), designing and constructing the throughfall displacement infrastructure, identifying key response variables, and collecting and analyzing the field data. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a regional research coordination network – Northern Forest DroughtNet – to investigate the impacts of changes in the amount and distribution of precipitation on the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and carbon (C) cycling dynamics of northern temperate forests. Specific objectives include the development of a standard prototype for conducting precipitation manipulation studies in forest ecosystems (in collaboration with the international DroughtNet-RCN) and the implementation of this prototype drought experiment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Here, we present the advances made thus far towards achieving the objectives of Northern Forest DroughtNet, plans for future work, and an invitation to the larger scientific community interested in precipitation manipulation experiments in forest ecosystems to participate in the network.",

            "abstract": "In California, the majority of wildfires are started by humans, rather than by natural ignitions (i.e. lightning). Given this importance of human activity, it is logical that patterns of ignition should be related to social, as well as ecological factors. In this paper, we explore the relationship of ignition to human behavior at a fine temporal scale: days of the week. Because more people typically enter both wildlands and the wildland-urban interface on weekends, we hypothesized that more wildfires would start on Saturdays and Sundays than on other days of the week.\nWe used data from California’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) database for human-caused fires occurring from 1950 through 2009, and omitted those that would not reasonably relate to day of the week (e.g. “Power Line”). These criteria yielded a dataset of 8644 fires over the 60-year period.\nOverall, 15.5% of the fires began on Saturdays, and 16.4% began on Sundays. This compares to the 14.3% that would be expected if ignitions were evenly distributed through the week. However, different patterns of weekend ignition emerge depending on time period, specific fire cause, and the type of administrative unit in which the fires occurred.\nThe proportion of fires beginning on the weekend declined from a high in the 1950s (17.3% Saturdays, 18.5% Sundays) to a low in the 1990s (13.5% Saturdays, 14.4% Sundays), before rebounding in the 2000s to close to the long-term average (15.3% Saturdays, 16.8% Sundays). “Campfire” was the ignition source most concentrated on weekends, with 20.6% of the fires attributed to this cause starting on Saturdays, and 20.2% on Sundays. By contrast, “Equipment” was under-represented on the weekend (13.5% Saturdays, 13.9% Sundays). Fires in California State Parks clearly show a weekend bias, with 19.4% initiated on Saturdays, and 16.7% on Sundays. On National Forests, 15.5% of fires began on Saturdays, and 18.4% on Sundays. Many fires were on private land, much of which is inaccessible to weekend recreationists; here weekend ignitions were still overrepresented, but by smaller margins (15.0% Saturdays, 15.8% Sundays).\nOf note, the proportion of weekend ignitions was much higher among fires that eventually became quite large. 142 human-caused fires exceeded 10,000 ha in size; of these 26.1% began on Saturdays, and 19.7 began on Sundays.",

            "abstract": "Accurate attenuation corrections to the measurements of the Ku- and Ka-band dual-wavelength precipitation radar (DPR) aboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite is crucial for estimates of precipitation rate and microphysical properties of hydrometeors. Surface reference technique (SRT) provides a means to infer path-integrated attenuation (PIA) by comparing differences of normalized surface cross sections (σ0) between rain and rain-free areas. Although single-wavelength SRT has been widely used in attenuation correction for airborne/spaceborne radar applications, its accuracy relies on the variance of σ0 in rain-free region. Dual-wavelength surface reference technique (DSRT) has shown promising ways to improve accuracy in PIA estimates over single-wavelength as a result of that the variance of the difference of PIA between two wavelengths (δPIA) is much smaller than the variance of σ0 at single wavelength arising from high correlation of σ0 between Ku- and Ka-bands. However, derivation of PIA at either wavelength from DSRT requires an assumption of the ratio of Ka- and Ku-band PIAs (p). Inappropriate assumption of this ratio will lead to the bias of PIA estimates.\nIn this study the ratio p will be investigated through measured DSD data. The attenuation coefficients at Ku and Ka bands are first computed directly from measured DSD spectra, and then regression analysis is performed to the data points (Ku- and Ka-band attenuation coefficients) in obtaining p values for rain. Taking an advantage of large collection of the DSD measurements from various GPM Ground Validation (GPM GV) programs, the results of the ratio p will be examined from different climatological regimes. Because PIA is affected by all types of hydrometeors contained in the columns of radar measurements, the synthetic profiles composed of different types of hydrometeors are constructed using measured DSD to look into impacts of different phase hydrometeors on the p values. To generate these profiles fully-, partially- and un-correlated DSD data are employed in an attempt to describe wide dynamic range of microphysical structures of hydrometeors. Bright-band model is employed to take into account of mixed-phase region, and additional attenuations due to cloud water are also included in the profiles.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes are commonly used to understand how physical and biological processes mediate the exchange of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Numerous studies have described fundamental relationships between environmental variables, the carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of recently assimilated sugars in plants, litter, soil carbon, or recently respired CO2. However, studies that examine the spatial variability of the 13C content of forest soils at the landscape scale are lacking. We report on measurements of the carbon isotopic composition of soil CO2 concentrations (δ13CC), soil CO2 production (δ13CP), and soil-atmosphere CO2 exchange (δ13CD) across a subalpine forest of the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana over two growing seasons. We evaluate the variability of these measurements across different landscape positions. Our analysis demonstrates that soil moisture and the lateral redistribution of soil water are strong predictors of the spatial variability of δ13CC, δ13CP, and δ13CD at the watershed scale. We suggest that there are concomitant yet independent effects of soil water on physical (i.e., soil gas diffusivity) and biological (i.e., photosynthetic activity) processes that mediate the 13C composition of forest soils. We show systematic spatial variability in the δ13C of forest soils at the landscape scale that can be useful to accurately predict and model land-atmosphere CO2 exchange over complex terrain.",

Due to its diverse volcanic and tectonic frameworks, the Azores archipelago represents an excellent case study for geophysical and geological proposes. Main results of a paleomagnetic study, conducted on oriented samples from approximately 60 accessible lava piles of three islands of Azores archipelago central group (Faial, Pico and Terceira islands) and covering as much as possible spatially and temporally these islands are: i) The paleomagnetic polarity is in close agreement with the radiometric results known for these islands; ii) Onshore volcanic activity began during the Matuyama geochron for Faial and during Brunhes for Terceira and Pico; iii) The mean ChRMs from Terceira and Pico islands result in a paleomagnetic pole similar to the ones retrieved from the studies of Johnson et al (1998) and Silva et al (2012), from S. Miguel and S. Jorge islands (other islands of Azores archipelago), respectively; iv) ChRMs from Faial show an elliptical distribution perpendicular to the WNW-ESE grabben that is the major structure of the island, suggesting tilting towards SSW of the southern wall and towards NNE of the northern one. The presence of listric faults plunging towards the middle of the grabben and aligned along the N110º azimuth could explain the elliptical distribution of paleomagnetic directions. This study is a contribution for the research project REGENA (PTDC/GEO-FIQ/3648/2012).\n",

            "abstract": "On Earth, highlighted in Japan, North America, Europe, and Greenland, accretionary complexes comprehensively record information compiled while the oceanic crust is en route from the mid-oceanic ridge to the subduction zone, spanning hundreds of millions of years. At the zone, oceanic crustal materials are stacked along thrust faults and/or subducted to be eventually recycled into the mantle. The surviving accretionary-complex materials include Ocean Plate Stratigraphy (OPS). The ideal succession of the OPS (from oldest to youngest) is mid-ocean ridge basalt, pelagic sediment including radiolarian chert, hemipelagic sediment including siliceous shale, and trench turbidite deposits. Therefore, accretionary complexes often record diverse environmental conditions from deep- to shallow-marine environments, including those perturbed by magmatic, impact, and possibly extrasolar events. Stratigraphic, impact-crater, paleotectonic, and magnetic-anomaly information point to Early Noachian (Hadean-equivalent) Martian geologic terrains; they are extremely ancient environmental records compared to those destroyed on Earth due to differences in planetary mass and evolutional states. Such record a dynamic phase of the evolution of Mars, including interacting ocean, landmass, and atmosphere, as well as possible plate tectonism during an operating dynamo. A candidate accretionary complex and nearby outcrops of steeply dipping beds comprising olistostrome-like blocks, nearby and in the Claritas rise, respectively, may be key evidence of major crustal shortening related to plate tectonism, in addition to being extremely ancient environmental records. Claritas rise is a rugged promontory about 250 km across, which forms the northwest part of an extremely ancient and large mountain range, Thaumasia highlands, with a length nearing 2,400 km, or approximating that of the Himalayas. Future investigation of the ancient Martian basement, which includes geochemical analyses for possible OPS sequences (an important test for the accretionary-complex hypothesis), as well as reconnaissance for other parts of Pacific-type orogenic complexes, which includes metamorphic belts, ophiolite sequences, and belts of felsic materials, will be an important next phase in the geologic investigation of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Empirical mechanistic models have been applied to the description of the stress and strain rate upon failure for heterogeneous materials. The behaviour of porous rocks and their analogous two-phase viscoelastic suspensions are particularly well-described by such models. Nevertheless, failure cannot yet be predicted forcing a reliance on other empirical prediction tools such as the Failure Forecast Method (FFM). Measurable, accelerating rates of physical signals (e.g., seismicity and deformation) preceding failure are often used as proxies for damage accumulation in the FFM. Previous studies have already statistically assessed the applicability and performance of the FFM, but none (to the best of our knowledge) has done so in terms of intrinsic material properties. Here we use a rheological standard glass, which has been powdered and then sintered for different times (up to 32 hours) at high temperature (675°C) in order to achieve a sample suite with porosities in the range of 0.10-0.45 gas volume fraction. This sample suite was then subjected to mechanical tests in a uniaxial press at a constant strain rate of 10-3 s-1 and a temperature in the region of the glass transition. A dual acoustic emission (AE) rig has been employed to test the success of the FFM in these materials of systematically varying porosity. The pore-emanating crack model describes well the peak stress at failure in the elastic regime for these materials. We show that the FFM predicts failure within 0-15% error at porosities >0.2. However, when porosities are <0.2, the forecast error associated with predicting the failure time increases to >100%. We interpret these results as a function of the low efficiency with which strain energy can be released in the scenario where there are few or no heterogeneities from which cracks can propagate. These observations shed light on questions surrounding the variable efficacy of the FFM applied to active volcanoes. In particular, they provide a systematic demonstration of the fact that a good understanding of the material properties is required. Thus, we wish to emphasize the need for a better coupling of empirical failure forecasting models with mechanical parameters, such as failure criteria for heterogeneous materials, and point to the implications of this for a broad range of material-based disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Based on GPS and seismic data, we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of a slow slip event (SSE) and associated seismic activity that occurred off the Boso peninsula, central Japan, from December 2013 to January 2014. We use GPS data from 71 stations of the GEONET and 6 stations operated by Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo and Tohoku University around the Boso peninsula. We apply a modified version of the Network Inversion Filter to the GPS time series at the 77 stations to estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of daily cumulative slip and slip rate on the subducting Philippine Sea plate. In addition, we create an improved earthquake catalog by applying a matched filter technique to continuous seismograms and examine the spatiotemporal relations between slow slip and seismicity. We find that the SSE started in early December 2013. The spatiotemporal evolution of slow slip and seismicity is divided into two distinct phases, an earlier slow phase from early to 30 December 2013 (Phase I) and a subsequent faster phase from 30 December 2013 to 9 January 2014 (Phase II). During Phase I, slip accelerated slowly up to a maximum rate of 1.6 m/yr with potentially accelerating　along-strike propagation at speeds on the order of 1 km/day or less and no accompanying seismicity. On the other hand, during Phase II, slip accelerated rapidly up to a maximum rate of 4.5 m/yr and then rapidly decelerated. The slip front propagated along strike at a constant speed of ~10 km/day. During the Phase II, slow slip was accompanied by seismic swarm activity that was highly correlated in space and time with slip rate, suggesting that the swarm activity was triggered by stress loading due to slow slip. Early slow acceleration of slip has not been identified in the past Boso SSEs in 1996, 2002, 2007, and 2011. It is not clear at this point whether the past Boso SSEs started with slow acceleration similarly to the 2013-2014 SSE. The transition from the slow to the faster phase shares some similarities with the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes inferred from foreshock activities, suggesting that SSEs may provide insights into the nucleation of large earthquakes.",

NASS has the mandate to report crop loss after all flood events. RMA manages crop insurance policy and uses crop loss information to guide the creation of the crop insurance policy and the aftermath compensation.\nMany studies have been conducted in the recent years on monitoring floods and assessing the crop loss due to floods with remote sensing and geographic information technologies. The Remote-sensing-based Flood Crop Loss Assessment Service System (RF-CLASS), being developed with NASA and USDA support, aims to significantly improve the post-flood agricultural decision-making supports in USDA by integrating and advancing the recently developed technologies. RF-CLASS will operationally provide information to support USDA decision making activities on collecting and archiving flood acreage and duration, recording annual crop loss due to flood, assessing the crop insurance rating areas, investigating crop policy compliance, and spot checking of crop loss claims. This presentation will discuss the remote sensing and GIS based methods for deriving the needed information to support the decision making, the RF-CLASS cybersystem architecture, the standards and interoperability arrangements in the system, and the current and planned capabilities of the system.",

            "abstract": "The impact of seasonal water stress on Africa’s tropical regions has yet to be characterized despite drought’s potential to cause famine and a reduction of biodiversity across the continent. Through the analysis of a new data set of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2, we demonstrate that fluorescence varies with water availability, particularly over regions with distinctive wet and dry seasons. Water availability was determined via both precipitation (from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project) and daytime canopy water content measurements (from the SeaWinds Scatterometer onboard the QuickSCAT satellite). Variance in SIF values was largely explained by both canopy water content and precipitation, which paralleled one-another. When viewed in the context of the previously defined relationship between fluorescence and gross primary production (GPP) – SIF scales linearly with GPP – our results suggest that photosynthetic activity in tropical Africa is limited by water availability. The characterization of this trend is critical in defining the response of tropical ecosystems to water stress and corroborating similar relationships in other tropical regions (e.g. Amazonia). Ultimately, the viability of Africa’s tropical regions amidst a changing climate is rooted in its ecosystem-wide response to water stress; the future of the African tropics is limited by how well plants cope with water stress.",

To quantify GHG emissions from lakes and reservoirs we coupled a lake carbon model (HLCM), a newly developed 1-dimension (1-D) thermal stratification model, and a terrestrial biogeochemistry model (DNDC) that is able to represent soil carbon dynamics under flooded conditions. We present here the first results of the newly coupled model, FAQ-DNDC. We evaluated the model for what mechanisms governs the CO2 emissions from a newly created shallow boreal reservoir, Eastmain-1, in northern Quebec, Canada. We compared simulated CO2 fluxes against eddy covariance tower measurements during the period of 2007-2012. The observed peak emissions in spring were simulated because water column might lose the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) accumulated through the ice-cover period in winter. The observed and simulated annual CO2 emissions from the reservoir surface gradually decline with reservoir age. The sensitivity analysis showed that CO2 emissions in high-latitude shallow reservoirs response strongly to warming owning to shorter ice cover period and higher decomposition rate under a warming scenario. We also found that terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) input would stimulate CO2 emissions from the reservoir. We conclude that models of aquatic carbon cycle should link terrestrial carbon cycle to better predicting GHG emissions from aquatic ecosystems and to better understanding the carbon balance of lake-rich regions.",

            "abstract": "For thirty years, the “injection boundary” model of substorm injections has provided a framework for studies of the impulsive transport of energetic electrons and ions into the inner magnetosphere. New, multi-satellite observations of substorm injections show signatures that require revision and rethinking of the classical picture. Recent observations by the LANL-GEO and GOES energetic particle instruments provide unprecedented coverage at geosynchronous orbit while the Van Allen Probes satellites provide simultaneous multi-point measurements inside geosynchronous orbit. With these satellites we can observe injections at three different radial distances and up to ten different local times - simultaneously. These observations reveal a complex and varied set of dynamics that have important implications for the development of the radiation belts and ring current.\nIn this study we look specifically at the radial penetration of energetic particle injections in storms and substorms. Radial alignments of satellites confirm and extend the CRRES/LANL-GEO observations of relatively slow inward propagation of the injection region inside geosynchronous orbit [1]. At the same time, synoptic Van Allen Probes observations show frequent storm-time “injection” of energetic (~50-500 keV) electrons to very low L-shells (L < 3) that have not previously been reported. The radial distribution of electrons and ions injected during storms and substorms have profound implications for the generation of waves, for the availability of a radiation belt “seed population”, and for the radial distribution of ring current ions. In this paper we will use multi-point satellite observations to understand the processes that inject energetic particles into the inner magnetosphere, the Earthward propagation of these injections, the conditions that control variation in Earthward extent of energetic particle injections, and how particles can be injected deep inside the plasmasphere and even through the slot region.\n[1] Reeves, G.

            "abstract": "Many paleotemperature reconstructions rely heavily on the Mg/Ca ratio of planktic foraminifers. The incorporation of Mg is highly dependent on temperature and is also subtly affected by other water column parameters (e.g. pH and salinity), but the nature of the biological control over Mg uptake into foraminiferal calcite has not been fully determined. The distribution of Mg within a single foraminifer test is often organized in intercalated bands of high and low-Mg/Ca ratio calcite. Initial studies showed that low Mg/Ca calcite is added during the day light hours and high Mg/Ca calcite during the night (Spero et al., in press). Banding has been attributed to 1) modification of pH in the microenvironment around the shell via symbiont photosynthesis/respiration, 2) an unknown circadian mechanism, and/or 3) differential mitochondrial pumping of Mg away from the calcifying shell surface during day and night phases.\nWe conducted several culture-based experiments to assess the affect of light on Mg/Ca variability in the planktic symbiont-bearing foraminifer Orbulina universa by culturing the foraminifers in different photoperiods including: 1) reversing the day/night cycle, 2) 24-hour constant light, and 3) 24-hour constant dark. With a reversed light/dark photoperiod, there is no 'lag' in the timing or amplitude of the Mg/Ca bands. In 24-hour constant light, the high Mg ‘night’ bands are reduced in amplitude and are no longer paced by a 24-hour cycle. This produces a mean shell Mg/Ca ratio that is lower than in shells growing on a normal light:dark cycle. Under 24-hour constant dark conditions, high Mg/Ca bands dominate the shell calcite. This produces a mean shell Mg/Ca ratio that is higher than shells grown on a normal light:dark cycle. These results suggest that a light cue, independent of photosymbiont activity, is responsible for controlling the presence/absence of high Mg/Ca banding and that ambient irradiance changes in the water column could influence overall Mg/Ca in O. universa shells. Additional experiments to investigate the light cue are underway and results will be presented at the fall meeting.",

            "abstract": "Low dissolved oxygen content in rivers threatens fish populations, aquatic organisms, and the health of entire ecosystems. River systems with high fluvial wetland abundance and organic matter, may result in high metabolism that in conjunction with low re-aeration rates, lead to low oxygen conditions. Increasing abundance of beaver ponds in many areas may exacerbate this phenomenon. This research aims to understand the impact of fluvial wetlands, including beaver ponds, on dissolved oxygen (D.O.) and metabolism throughout the headwaters of the Ipswich R. watershed, MA, USA. In several fluvial wetland dominated systems, we measured diel D.O. and metabolism in the upstream inflow, the surface water transient storage zones of fluvial wetland sidepools, and at the outflow to understand how the wetlands modify dissolved oxygen. D.O. was also measured longitudinally along entire surface water flow paths (x-y km long) to determine how low levels of D.O. propagate downstream. Nutrient samples were also collected to understand how their behavior was related to D.O. behavior. Results show that D.O. in fluvial wetlands has large swings with periods of very low D.O. at night. D.O. swings were also seen in downstream outflow, though lagged and somewhat attenuated. Flow conditions affect the level of inundation and the subsequent effects of fluvial wetlands on main channel D.O.. Understanding the D.O. behavior throughout river systems has important implications for the ability of river systems to remove anthropogenic nitrogen.",

            "abstract": "Since Korean Air has begun to use the polar route from Seoul/ICN airport to New York/JFK airport on August 2006, there are explosive needs for the estimation and prediction against cosmic radiation exposure for Korean aircrew and passengers in South Korea from public. To keep pace with those needs of public, Korean government made the law on safety standards and managements of cosmic radiation for the flight attendants and the pilots in 2013. And we have begun to develop our own Korean Radiation Exposure Assessment Model (KREAM) for aviation route dose since last year funded by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). GEANT4 model and NRLMSIS 00 model are used for calculation of the energetic particles’ transport in the atmosphere and for obtaining the background atmospheric neutral densities depending on altitude. For prediction the radiation exposure in many routes depending on the various space weather effects, we constructed a database from pre-arranged simulations using all possible combinations of R, S, and G, which are the space weather effect scales provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). To get the solar energetic particles’ spectrum at the 100 km altitude which we set as a top of the atmospheric layers in the KREAM, we use ACE and GOES satellites’ proton flux observations. We compare the results between KREAM and the other cosmic radiation estimation programs such as CARI-6M which is provided by the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA). We also validate KREAM’s results by comparison with the measurement from Liulin-6K LET spectrometer onboard Korean commercial flights and Korean Air Force reconnaissance flights.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric processes span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Combined with the inherent non-linearity of many chemical processes, this presents difficulties for accurate numerical modeling of atmospheric composition. Earlier works have found that with coarse resolution models, ozone production tends to be overestimated in urban environments due to NOx being diluted within large grid cells that artificially mix both urban and non-urban air. The impact of grid resolution on modeling the chemical regime of the Southeastern US, which is largely affected by biogenic VOCs, has not been previously studied. In this study, the sensitivity of various species to resolution is examined by running the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25x0.3125 degree (~25 km), 2x2.5 degree, and 4x5 degree resolution and quantifying model errors as constrained by observations from the SEAC4RS aircraft campaign. Species respond differently to grid resolution depending on its lifetime and chemical non-linearity. We find that higher resolution models are better able to capture variability present in the observations, leading to better representation of extreme values, even if correlations between model and observations do not always improve with increasing resolution. Coarse resolution models also induce bias – the 4x5 and 2x2.5 degree models were unable to accurately simulate the low-NOx, high-isoprene environment found in parts of the Southeastern US, tending to underestimate isoprene and overestimate NOx, which leads to overestimates of ozone in these regions. At higher resolution, a smaller fraction of the isoprene hydroxy-peroxy radicals react with NO, possibly due to better segregation of high-NOx and low-NOx environments. Given the computational cost of running high-resolution simulations, it is important to understand what kind of biases and differences occur when running a model at different resolutions.",

            "abstract": "The formation, growth and migration of dunes have important implications for sediment transport and flow resistance in many of the world’s sand-bedded rivers. The notion that dunes scale with depth is often cited as a definitive feature of these bedforms and suggests that depth exerts a major control on dune geometry and dynamics. Empirical relations often suggest that height scales as 1/6 depth and length as 5 times the depth. However, there is limited evidence for this scaling in the literature and no widely accepted theory to explain why dunes grow to a certain height. Here, we reexamine published dune dimension data from over 20 flume and 20 field studies to critically test the assumption that dunes are depth-scaled in rivers. The results, particularity in the field data, do show a general trend of increasing dune height with depth but these relations are subject to considerable scatter. Most data plot higher than the 1/6 depth scaling and fall within a wide range from 1/2 to 1/25 depth. Depth must exert some control on dune dynamics as few dunes have heights above 1/2 the depth, yet the scatter indicates that depth is not the only control on dune size. Transport stage, defined as the non-dimensional Shields stress divided by its value at the threshold for sediment entrainment, exerts a stronger control on dune dimensions. As transport stage increase, dunes grow in height but then decrease as the length grows. This pattern produces a bell-shaped plot of aspect ratio (height/length) as transport stage increases. Further investigation of the physical mechanisms that control dune height and length are sorely needed in order to better understand dune dynamics in natural systems.",

The ice sheets have been implicated in this rapid climate change, but a recent study of ancient corals has implicated the deep oceans (Thiagarajan et al. Abrupt pre-Bolling-Allerod warming and circulation changes in the deep ocean. Nature 511, 75-81, 2014). We will first review the climate data and then report on our numerical model, which seems to support the oceanic hypothesis. The mechanism is thermobaric instability, which depends on the increase of the thermal coefficient of expansion with depth and can lead to a sudden release of stored potential energy (Su and Ingersoll. Ocean Convective Available Potential Energy. Part I: Concept and Calculation, and Part II: Energetics of Thermobaric Convection. J. Phys. Oceanogr., submitted, 2014). The model is two-dimensional—a slice through a vertical plane. It has salt diffusion, temperature diffusion and viscous dissipation, and it conserves energy exactly—to the round off error of the machine. We have run our model with realistic parameters and will compare the results with the deglaciation record.",

However, the rate of particle removal by vegetation remains poorly characterized, especially for fine particles. In this study, we monitored particle concentration and size distribution (1.25 – 250 µm diameter suspended road dust) in a laboratory flume as flow velocity, plant stem density, initial particle concentration, and the presence of biofilm on vegetation were varied. We characterized change in particle concentration through time by calculating decay constants, termed capture rates. Based on our experiments, we found that suspended particle concentration decayed more rapidly in the presence, rather than in the absence, of vegetation. Additionally, particle capture rates increased with stem density, particle size, and the presence of biofilm, while decreasing with flow velocity. These results demonstrate that low flow velocities and the presence of biofilm optimize particle capture by vegetation. Our results are relevant to floodplain and wetland restoration efforts.",

Guidance documents soon emerged from state entities, including regulatory agencies, which caused further confusion.\nThe City and County of San Francisco, surrounded by water on three sides, began developing City-wide sea level rise guidance in 2013. A Sea Level Rise Committee featuring representatives of key infrastructure managers met over a nine month period, and their work included an in-depth review of the science of sea level rise. To convert divergent scientific reports into “actionable science” required not only a close reading of each but extensive expert elicitation to tease out the meaning behind each of the numbers and the associated uncertainties. In the end, sufficient consistency between the differing projections, fortified by political exigencies, allowed a “scientific consensus” with actionable science value for the City to surface. The resulting document, “Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco,” begins by providing a scientific underpinning for planning, guidelines for incorporating uncertainty – particularly for accommodating multiple projections for any particular time slice – and outlines a four step process for assessment and adaptation. It also relies on new state-of-the-art inundation maps produced as part of the SFPUC’s capital improvement program. Together, the Guidance and associated tools provide a road map for successful assessment and adaptation to sea level rise. We will also draw lessons from the experience that may be of value to science leaders seeking to make contributions in the decision making domain.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission controls have led to improved air quality (particularly in the Eastern US) over the past two decades, but concerns have been raised that climate warming may offset some of these gains in the coming decades. Here we address these concerns by analyzing the effect of projected future changes of emissions and climate, in isolation and combination, on US surface ozone (O3) during the 21st century in an ensemble of simulations (3 members per scenario) performed with the GFDL chemistry-climate model CM3. We analyze two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Under both scenarios, NOx emissions decrease by ~80% over North America by 2100. In additional 3-member ensemble simulations, termed RCP4.5_WMGG and RCP8.5_WMGG, well-mixed greenhouse gases follow the respective RCP but O3 and aerosol precursor emissions are held at 2005 levels. These simulations enable us to isolate the role of well-mixed greenhouse gas induced climate change from that of emission reductions. Another set of simulations, following RCP8.5 but with methane (CH4) held fixed at 2005 levels, termed RCP8.5_2005CH4, allows us to quantify the background influence of CH4 on O3. For each season, we examine changes in the surface O3 distribution over the US during the 21st century, calculating policy relevant statistics: days above the current national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) of 75 ppb and other proposed future levels, as well as the probabilistic 1-year return levels for maximum daily 8-hour average ozone (MDA8 O3), within each model grid cell. Specifically, we analyze: (i) regional and seasonal changes in the frequency and return level of high O3 pollution events during the 21st century, as well as (ii) differences among the RCPs by the middle and end of the 21st century. We find that the response of surface O3 to changes in emissions and climate varies strongly, seasonally and spatially, with certain regions more prone to a ‘climate penalty’ (e.g., the Northern US) or a ‘climate benefit’ (e.g. the Southeast). Finally we demonstrate an empirical relationship between changes in O3 precursor emissions and O3 return levels on a regional basis.",

There is an increasing focus to study the environmental impact of agricultural crops, however not much is known on the influence on the energy, carbon and water cycles of energy crops, especially under drought conditions. This study compares the impact of drought episodes (in 2011 and 2012) on evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and water use efficiency (WUE; equals to NEP/ET) for Switchgrass (SW), Miscanthus (MXG), Maize (MZ) and native prairie (NP) grown in Central Illinois using the eddy covariance technique.\nDue to the prolonged drought and the rapid growth development with increasing ET of MXG in 2012, large water deficit (precipitation-ET) was observed for each species up to the highest deficit of -360 mm for this species. The gross primary production (GPP) of MZ was radically decreased by the drought in 2011 and 2012, while SW and NP were not influenced. MXG increased NEP throughout the typically wet and drought years, mainly due to the decrease in respiration and by the largest GPP upon the drought in 2012. Despite having the largest water deficit, MXG showed an enhanced WUE of 12.8 and 11.4 Kg C ha-1mm-1 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, in comparison to years typical to the region with WUE of 3.7-7.3 Kg C ha-1mm-1. Other species did not show a significant enhancement of WUE. Therefore we conclude that out of the studied species, MXG has more access to water, and uses this water the most efficiently to store carbon, under drought conditions.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we present the phase transition from gabbro into granulite and finally into kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclogite. The investigated rock sample is a heterogeneous kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclogite from the Earth’s mantle collected at the Roberts Victor Diamond mine in South Africa. Plagioclase of the former granulite reacted completely out under low H2O activity (fH2O) to form this kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclogite. To quantify the phase transitions of the original gabbroic precursor, which was first metamorphosed under H-T granulite facies conditions followed by metamorphism under Earth’s mantle conditions into both types of eclogite, a petrological, geochemical and a mass balance approach has been made. i) The results from our petrological approach show that Ca-rich garnet, which is coexistent with Ca-rich omphacite are the metastable phases from the original granulite in the kyanite-bearing relict while Mg-rich garnet, coexistent with Na-rich omphacite are the stable phases in the bimineralic eclogite part which shows equilibration conditions of ~5.5 Gpa and ~1200°C. ii) Our geochemical results show a positive Eu anomaly in garnet from the kyanite-bearing part, which indicates that the igneous precursor of the granulite was a gabbro, probably oceanic crust. Most of the rare earth elements show an excellent correlation with the major elements of the rock forming minerals during the plagioclase-out reaction of the former granulite. The LREE in garnet are removed during the formation of the bimineralic eclogite due to loss of the anorthite component in plagioclase of the former granulite. Contrary, the HREE are enriched in garnets in the bimineralic part of the eclogite compared to those in the kyanite zone, and correlate with the Mg-Ca exchange between both garnet generations. iii) Garnet d18O values ranging between ~5.27 and ~5.90 in the kyanite part and systematically decrease to values of ~5.81 to ~6.29 in the bimoneralic part. The difference in the d18O values is indicative for two different fluid pulses. iv) The following kyanite bearing and bimineralic eclogite forming reaction from the original granulite was calculated from our mass balance approach: 0.625 Cpx + 0.45 Plag + 0.925 Grs + 0.89 MgO + 1.15 CO2 = 1 Pyp + 1 Omph + 0.04 Ky + 1.15 Cc.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt is an important source of surface water for ecosystems, river flow, drinking water, and production of hydroelectric power. Thus accurate modeling of snow accumulation and melt is needed to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on mountain snowpack and for use in water resource forecasting and management decisions. One of the largest potential sources of uncertainty in modeling mountain snow is the net radiative flux. This is because while net irradiance makes up the majority of the surface energy balance, it is one of the most difficult forcings to measure at remote mountain locations.\nHere we investigate the use of irradiances derived from satellite measurements in the place of surface observations. NASA’s Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) SYN satellite product provides longwave and shortwave irradiances at the ground on three-hourly temporal and one degree spatial resolution.Although the low resolution of these data is a drawback, their availability over the entire globe for the full period of March 2000 through December 2010 (and beyond, as processing continues) makes them an attractive option for use in modeling. We first assessed the accuracy of the SYN downwelling solar and longwave fluxes by comparison to measurements at NOAA’s Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD) reference stations and at remote mountain stations. The performance of several snow models of varying complexity when using SYN irradiances as forcing data was then evaluated. Simulated snow water equivalent and runoff from cases using SYN data fell in the range of those from simulations forced with irradiances from higher quality surface observations or more highly-regarded empirical methods. We therefore judge the SYN irradiances to be suitable for use in snowmelt modeling and preferable to in situ measurements of questionable quality.",

            "abstract": "Until in-situ measurements can be made regularly on extraterrestrial bodies, thermodynamic models are the only tools to investigate the properties and behavior of chemical systems on those bodies. The resulting findings are often critical in describing physicochemical processes in the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface in planetary geochemistry and climate studies. The extremely cold conditions on Triton, Pluto and other Kuiper Belt Objects, and Titan introduce huge non-ideality that prevents conventional models from performing adequately. At such conditions, atmospheres as a whole—not components individually—are subject to phase equilibria with their equilibrium solid phases or liquid phases or both. A molecular-based thermodynamic model for cryogenic chemical systems, referred to as CRYOCHEM, the development of which is still in progress, was shown to reproduce the vertical composition profile of Titan’s atmospheric methane measured by the Huygens probe (Tan et al., Icarus 2013, 222, 53). Recently, the model was also used to describe Titan’s global circulation where the calculated composition of liquid in Ligeia Mare is consistent with the bathymetry and microwave absorption analysis of T91 Cassini fly-by data (Tan et al., 2014, submitted). Its capability to deal with equilibria involving solid phases has also been demonstrated (Tan et al., Fluid Phase Equilib. 2013, 360, 320). With all those previous works done, our attention is now shifting to the lower temperatures in Titan's tropopause and on Pluto’s surface, where much technical development remains for CRYOCHEM to assure adequate performance at low temperatures. In these conditions, solid-vapor equilibrium (SVE) is the dominant phase behavior that determines the composition of the atmosphere and the existing ices. Another potential application is for the subsurface phase equilibrium, which also involves liquid, thus three-phase equilibrium: solid-liquid-vapor (SLV). This presentation will discuss the current state of CRYOCHEM in representing the SVE and SLV of chemical systems at temperatures and pressures relevant to Titan’s tropopause and Pluto and the upper crusts of these objects.",

While the chemical pathways involved in ozonolysis driven SOA formation from individual monoterpene precursors is known, local and regional chemical transport models are still lacking observations of speciated monoterpenes from forested atmospheres. Here, we present high vertically resolved mixing ratio profiles of speciated monoterpenes from the ambient air of three neighboring forested ecosystems in the central Amazon Basin. Two well-drained plateau primary forests and one seasonally flooded valley forest were sampled during the afternoon hours (13:00 – 16:30) on walkup towers from the initiation of the 2013-14 wet season through the onset of the 2014 dry season (Nov 2013 – Jul 2014). Ambient mixing ratios in all three ecosystems were greatest in the upper canopy with secondary sources of some monoterpenes within the sub-canopies. Relative vertical compositions of monoterpenes did not change significantly throughout the seasons for either ecosystem type. Both ecosystem types were dominated by d-limonene (up to 1.6 ppb) with equally strong mixing ratios of alpha-pinene in the valley compared to the much weaker a-pinene mixing ratios on the plateaus (up to 200 ppt). The highly reactive cis- and trans-beta-ocimene were consistently present in both ecosystems (up to 250 ppt) with the addition of equally high camphene mixing ratios in the valley forest (up to 200 ppt) which is present in the plateau ecosystems in low quantities (50 ppt). With respect to clean atmosphere mixing ratios of 10 ppb ozone, lifetimes are below 2 hours for camphene and below 30 minutes for ocimene, suggesting a potentially large impact on local and possibly regional ozonolysis and subsequent SOA composition.",

            "abstract": "40Ar/39Ar age inter-calibration experiments, conducted as part of the US NSF sponsored EARTHTIME initiative, (\nhttp://www.earth-time.org\n), using two of the most commonly used 40Ar/39Ar mineral standards, Fish Canyon (FC, ~28.2 Ma) and Alder Creek (AC, ~1.2 Ma) sanidines, have revealed significant inter-laboratory inconsistencies. The reported ages for the AC sanidines range from 1.173 to 1.200 Ma (FC 28.02) (±~2%), ~4 times greater than the reported precision. These experiments have caused the 40Ar/39Ar community to scrutinize procedures and several informal lab intercalibrations have been conducted among different labs. This exercise is leading to better agreement, but discrepancies remain that need to be addressed.\nIn an effort to isolate the cause(s) of these inconsistencies, two Argon Inter-calibration Pipette System (APIS) were designed and constructed. Each consists of three gas canisters; one contains atmospheric Ar, while the other two contain artificial gas mixtures with 40Ar/39Ar ratios similar to those of FC and AC. Each canister has 4x10-10 moles of 40Ar, is equipped with 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 cc pipettes, and can deliver gas volumes from 0.1-0.7 cc. All volumes were determined manometrically to 0.4% or better and then filled to uniform pressure with Ar standard gases. This experimental design eliminates sample heterogeneity, leaving only interlaboratory variations in gas purification, data reduction, and isotopic measurement as potential sources of interlaboratory calibration discrepancies.\nAPIS-1 was designated as a traveling unit that is brought to participating labs. APIS-2 is the reserve/master standard. Currently, APIS-1 is in its early stages in the voyage and has been to three labs (Rutgers, LDEO, and New Mexico Tech) as of this writing. The interlaboratory comparisons are ongoing, and will include ASU, BGC, Univ. of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University, plus additional laboratories of opportunity.

            "abstract": "The heightened media attention surrounding the 2013-14 solar maximum presented an excellent opportunity to examine the ever-increasing vulnerability of US national security and its Department of Defense to space weather. This vulnerability exists for three principal reasons: 1) a massive US space-based infrastructure; 2) an almost exclusive reliance on an aging and stressed continental US power grid; and 3) a direct dependence upon a US economy adapted to the conveniences of space and uninterrupted power.\nI tailored my research and work for the national security policy maker and military strategists in an endeavor to initiate and inform a substantive dialogue on America’s preparation for, and response to, a major solar event that would severely degrade core national security capabilities, such as military operations. Significant risk to the Department of Defense exists from powerful events that could impact its space-based infrastructure and even the terrestrial power grid. Given this ever-present and increasing risk to the United States, my work advocates raising the issue of space weather and its impacts to the level of a national security threat. With the current solar cycle having already peaked and the next projected solar maximum just a decade away, the government has a relatively small window to make policy decisions that prepare the nation and its Defense Department to mitigate impacts from these potentially catastrophic phenomena.",

            "abstract": "The historical reconstruction of past environmental changes in watersheds is essential to understand watershed response to disturbances and how those diturbances could affect the provision of valuable goods like water. That reconstruction requires the interpretation of natural records, mainly associated to sedimentary deposits that store detailed information in the form of specific biogenic molecules (i.e. biomarkers). In forested watersheds terrestrial vegetation is an important source of biomarkers like those associated to Lignin, a complex organic polymer used by plants to provide physical support in its tissues. Through litter inputs Lignin is deposited in soils and then is transported to sedimentary environments by rivers (e.g. floodplains, lake bottoms), serving as a source of information about vegetation changes in watersheds. In spite of the critical character of the information extracted from biomarkers in sedimentary records, the very concept of information is still used in a metaphorical sense, even though it was formally defined more than 60 years ago and has been applied extensively in ecology (e.g. Shannon's diversity index). Furthermore, sophisticated techniques are being used to deliver more complex molecular data that require examination and validation as indicators for watershed historical reconstructions. My research aims to explore the applicability of some information metrics (i.e. diversity indices, information coefficients) to a diverse molecular set derived from the chemical depolymerization of lignin deposited in floodplains and lake sediments in different basins. This approach attempts to assess the informational characteristics of Lignin as an indicator of natural/human-induced perturbations in forested watersheds. The formal assessment of the informational characteristics of natural records could have a profound impact not only in our methodological approaches but also in our philosophical view about information and communication in natural environments.",

The goal of this work is to mine data archives acquired from commercial operators using new algorithms that can detect when a space weather (or non-space weather) event of interest has occurred or is in progress. We have developed algorithms to statistically analyze power amplifier current and temperature telemetry and identify deviations from nominal operations or other trends of interest. We then examine space weather data to see what role, if any, it might have played. We also closely examine both long and short periods of time before an anomaly to determine whether or not the anomaly could have been predicted.",

            "abstract": "As the high performance computing (HPC) community pushes towards the exascale horizon, the importance and prevalence of fine-grained parallelism in new computer architectures is increasing. This is perhaps most apparent in the proliferation of so-called \"accelerators\" such as the Intel Xeon Phi or NVIDIA GPGPUs, but the trend also holds for CPUs, where serial performance has grown slowly and effective use of hardware threads and vector units are becoming increasingly important to realizing high performance. This has significant implications for weather, climate, and Earth system modeling codes, many of which display impressive scalability across MPI ranks but take relatively little advantage of threading and vector processing. In addition to increasing parallelism, next generation codes will also need to address increasingly deep hierarchies for data movement: NUMA/cache levels, on node vs. off node, local vs. wide neighborhoods on the interconnect, and even in the I/O system. We will discuss some approaches (grounded in experiences with the Intel Xeon Phi architecture) for restructuring Earth science codes to maximize concurrency across multiple levels (vectors, threads, MPI ranks), and also discuss some novel approaches for minimizing expensive data movement/communication.",

            "abstract": "The future of water availability and security is of paramount importance. A climacteric challenge toward the future sustainability of this precious resource is to identify where and when water may become substantially limited in the coming decades and what are the key drivers. The sustainability of water resources are affected by many factors that include: population, wealth, energy, land use, as well as climate. Yet, prediction systems are challenged by uncertainties in models and observational support as well as the practical and theoretical limits-to-prediction of the Earth's systems. This limits any one forecast of a potential future as actionable information - and the scientific community has moved toward risk-based assessments to provide a likelihood of outcomes - to the fullest extent possible.\nWe present a synopsis of recently published and ongoing analyses from experiments with the MIT Integrated System Model (IGSM) linked to a Water Resource System (WRS). These experiments address the future of water stress in a global context as well as with regional lenses over the United States and a large portion of Southern and Eastern Asia. By 2050, global economic growth and population change can lead to an additional 1.8 billion people living under at least moderate water stress, with 80% located in developing countries. Combined, socioeconomic growth and uncertain climate change lead to a 1.0–1.3 billion increase of the world’s 2050 projected population living with overly exploited water conditions—where total potential water requirements will consistently exceed surface water supply. Using a large ensemble of scenarios that are consistent across economics, emissions, climate, population, etc., we develop risk portfolios of water stress over a large portion of Asia (Figure 1) and isolate the effects of socioeconomic growth (population and wealth) and climate change. We find the number of people under water stress more than doubles from about 800 million to 1.7 billion by 2050. These insights point to needed actions to adapt and protect future water supplies. Further experimental simulations are presented to demonstrate the utility of widespread adaptive measures that include: enhanced storage and transfer as well as water-use efficiency and reduced consumption.",

            "abstract": "Exoplanetary radio emission is a potential goldmine of information about a wider sample of planetary interiors, dynamos, and magnetospheres than our solar system provides. To date, however, radio searches for exoplanetary radio emission have been unsuccessful likely because the observing frequencies are too high. Using the relatively new Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), we present analyses of observations of the highly eccentric Jovian exoplanet HD80606b during five epochs before and after the planet's periastron.\nAll of the gas giants in the solar system, as well as the Earth, exhibit magnetospheric radio emission due to the electron cyclotron maser instability. The power of this emission is modulated by the solar wind intensity. HD80606b is in a highly eccentric (e=0.93) orbit with a 111 day period. As the planet passes from apastron (0.88 AU) to periastron (0.03 AU), it experiences widely varying stellar wind conditions which should lead to variable radio emission with the highest power corresponding to periastron passage. HD80606b has been observed previously with the VLA at 325 MHz and 1425 MHz by Lazio et. al (2010), but LOFAR's lower frequency range (30-75 MHz) and high sensitivity is better suited to Jovian-type radio emissions.\nThe LOFAR observations were made 48 hours and 18 hours pre-periastron, plus 18 and 48 hours post-periastron to capture the predicted strongest emission, and near apastron to provide a baseline level. The data are analyzed for both time-dependent and frequency dependent emission at each of the five observation epochs. This work presents the ongoing analysis of the data.\nPart of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "High resolution maps of urban vegetation and biomass are powerful tools for policy-makers and community groups seeking to reduce rates of urban runoff, moderate urban heat island effects, and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. We develop a very high resolution map of urban tree biomass, assess the scale sensitivities in biomass estimation, compare our results with lower resolution estimates, and explore the demographic relationships in biomass distribution across the City of Boston. We integrated remote sensing data (including LiDAR-based tree height estimates) and field-based observations to map canopy cover and aboveground tree carbon storage at ~1 m spatial scale. Mean tree canopy cover was estimated to be 25.5±1.5% and carbon storage was 355 Gg (28.8 Mg C ha-1) for the City of Boston. Tree biomass was highest in forest patches (110.7 Mg C ha-1), but residential (32.8 Mg C ha-1) and developed open (23.5 Mg C ha-1) land uses also contained relatively high carbon stocks. In contrast with previous studies, we did not find significant correlations between tree biomass and the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods, including income, education, race, or population density. The proportion of households that rent was negatively correlated with urban tree biomass (R2=0.26, p=0.04) and correlated with Priority Planting Index values (R2=0.55, p=0.001), potentially reflecting differences in land management among rented and owner-occupied residential properties. We compared our very high resolution biomass map to lower resolution biomass products from other sources and found that those products consistently underestimated biomass within urban areas. This underestimation became more severe as spatial resolution decreased. This research demonstrates that 1) urban areas contain considerable tree carbon stocks; 2) canopy cover and biomass may not be related to the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods; and 3) that recent advances in high resolution remote sensing have the potential to improve the characterization and management of urban vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Over the last several years, hydrocarbon exploitation and development in North America has been heavily centered on shale gas plays. However, the physical attributes of shales and their manifestation on transport properties and storage capacity remain poorly understood. Therefore, more experimentally based data are needed to fill the gaps in understanding both transport and storage of fluids in shale. The proposed work includes installation and testing of an experimental system which is capable of monitoring the dynamic evolution of shale core permeability under variable loading conditions and in coordination with X-ray microCT imaging. The goal of this study is to better understand and quantify fluid flow patterns and associated transport dynamics of fractured shale samples. The independent variables considered in this study are: mechanical loading and pore pressure. The mechanical response of shale core is captured for different loading paths. To best replicate the in-situ production scenario, the pore pressure is progressively depleted to mimic pressure decline. During the course of experimentation, permeability is estimated using the pulse-decay method under tri-axial stress boundary conditions. Simultaneously, X-ray microCT imaging is used with a tracer gas that is allowed to flow through the sample as an illuminating agent. In the presence of an illuminating agent, either Xenon or Krypton, the X-ray CT scanner can image fractures, global pathways and diffusional fronts in the matrix, as well as sorption sites that reflect heterogeneities in the sample and localized deformation. Anticipated results from these experiments will help quantify permeability evolution as a function of different loading conditions and pore pressure depletion. Also, the X-ray images will help visualize the change of flow patterns and the intensity of sorption as a function of mechanical loading and pore pressure.",

A collaborative team from the Earth Science Information Partnership (ESIP) has gotten together to design and create a web service, called ToolMatch, to address these problems. The team began their efforts by defining an initial, relatively simple conceptual model that addressed the two uses cases briefly described above. The conceptual model is expressed as an ontology using OWL (Web Ontology Language) and DCterms (Dublin Core Terms), and utilizing standard ontologies such as DOAP (Description of a Project), FOAF (Friend of a Friend), SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary). The ToolMatch service will be taking advantage of various Semantic Web and Web standards, such as OpenSearch, RESTful web services, SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) and SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language). The first version of the ToolMatch service was deployed in early fall 2014. While more complete testing is required, a number of communities besides ESIP member organizations have expressed interest in collaborating to create, test and use the service and incorporate it into their own web pages, tools and / or services including the USGS Data Catalog service, DataONE, the Deep Carbon Observatory, Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO), and the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

            "abstract": "This study investigates environmental variability recorded in lacustrine and wetland sediments of Seneca Lake. Sediments display a range of stable isotopic and elemental chemistries suggesting there are changes in lake level, climate, or both during the Holocene in central New York. A ~13.5 m sediment core collected from the Catharine Creek wetland located south of Watkins Glen, NY at the southern tip of Seneca Lake was analyzed for total nitrogen (% TN), total organic carbon (% TOC), C/N ratios, δ13C of bulk organic matter (δ13Corg) and δ13Ccc and δ18Occ of carbonate. There is little change in TOC with the exception of an organic-rich interval (~20% TOC) between 5.5 and 4.3 m. Between 13.5 and 6 m, the C/N ratios decrease gradually upcore, from ~40 to ~10 – 20 and is paralleled by an increase in δ13Corg values from ~ -27‰ to ~ -24‰. Between 6-5.5 m, δ13C becomes significantly more negative (~ -30‰). The δ13Corg increases (to -26‰) upcore from 5.5 to 2.4 m. High C/N values (ranging from 60 to 20) from 15.5 to 11.8 m are consistent with input of land plants. The C/N values from 11.8 to 2.6 m range from 10 – 20 and represents a mixed signal of both algal and land plant derived organic matter. Throughout the Holocene, there has been a steady shift from negative δ13Corg values to more positive values of organic matter, which is consistent with an increase in the abundance of C4 plants in the watershed. Shifts in C/N over the length of the core suggest changes in lake level. In contrast, carbonate isotopic values (δ13Ccc and δ18Occ) do not covary and trends are consistent with a fresh-water, over-filled lake. In most lacustrine carbonate studies, calculated paleo-water temperatures from δ18Occ are commonly used prima facie to reflect environmental variability and constrain temperatures. In this study, wide variations in the calculated paleo-water temperatures reflect multiple carbonate sources / fractionations invalidating their use as a first order indication of temperature. We interpret the vertical stratigraphic variations of both δ13Corg and δ13Ccc to reflect either multiple sources or changes in internal carbon cycling / processes or both driven by a complex history of lake level changes associated with isostatic rebound.",

            "abstract": "The Central Costa Rica Deformed Belt (CCRDB) is a ~100 km broad zone of deformation that marks the boundary between the Caribbean Plate and the Panama Microplate. From December 2011 to February 2012 an earthquake swarm took place on a portion of the CCRDB, near the town of Tobosi, in the Cartago province. In this study, we use data recorded by the National Seismological Network of Costa Rica (RSN: UCR-ICE) to relocate 22 of these earthquakes and calculate focal mechanisms. Additionally, we analyze the Tectonic Geomorphology of the region. Our results show a transtension structure near the town of Tobosi, which comprises at least three faults, named: the Tobosi, Tablon, and Alumbre faults. This structure is located only 5 km south of the Aguacaliente fault, which caused the deadliest earthquake in Costa Rican history on May 4, 1910 (Ms 6.4). The earthquake locations analyzed are aligned with the Tobosi Fault. The events varied in moment magnitude between 2.4 and 3.9 Mw and depths of 1 and 8 km. The largest events were felt mainly in the town of Tobosi and as far as San Jose, the capital city of Costa Rica. We found that the Tobosi fault is an active left-lateral strike-slip fault with a normal component and is the source of the Tobosi earthquake swarm. The study of active faults in Central Costa Rica is significant as it may greatly improve seismic hazards assessment for this region where most of the population and the main economic activities are concentrated.",

            "abstract": "A key component of a dust emission scheme is the threshold for sediment transport, which is a function of soil size distribution, soil moisture, air and soil particle density, and surface roughness. For a particular region or landform that is not vegetated the variable that controls the transport threshold the most is soil moisture. This is because it is assumed that the other components vary little (air and soil particle densities) or are kept constant (soil size distribution and surface roughness). This puts the emphasis very heavily on soil moisture and wind stress as the key drivers of dust emission for specific landforms and dust emission schemes. Dust emission measurements were undertaken in 2011 on Sua Pan in Botswana, a large, flat, unvegetated salt pan, as part of the Dust Observation for Models (DO4 Models) campaign. The observations consisted of 11 climate stations placed within a 144 km2. Out of the measured and calculated erodibility parameters responsible for predicting transport threshold within current schemes, surface soil moisture and aerodynamic roughness length varied the most over the duration of the project and spatially across the pan. In 2011, the pan was drying from extensive flooding and rainfall in the previous wet season. Within the dry winter season months of June through September the dominantly eastern winds dried the pan developing a directional increase in aerodynamic roughness length over time. This cumulated in a region of maximum roughness length with the highest potential for dust emissions. In some cases, the aerodynamic roughness length of the bare soil increased by three orders of magnitude within the three month period. This increase in roughness almost doubles the modelled threshold shear velocity required for this surface to be emissive. The temporal and spatial variability of the calculated transport threshold is explored with observed data and compared with the modelled transport threshold for this region for the campaign duration. These results suggest that for dry saline lakes and other evaporite and unvegetated emissive surfaces the surface roughness changes dramatically from season to season and can have a direct effect on the soil surface emissivity. In conclusion, more research is needed to resolve the variation in spatial and temporal dust production within these landform.",

            "abstract": "Numerous speleothem studies have analysed the age distribution of stalagmites harvested from multiple caves and inferred important changes in paleoclimates to explain stalagmite growth phases. However, stalagmites take tens to hundreds of thousands of years to grow, and thus the twin desires to preserve the cave condition for future generations and advance palaeoclimate science are often in conflict. In this study we use U/Th ages from low impact mini-cores extracted in situ from the bases of stalagmites, thus keeping the intrinsic value of the cave intact.\nOur case study is based on 77 individual stalagmites drilled in situ in thirteen caves located in and around Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The stalagmites grew during discrete time intervals within the last ~530,000 years, and analysis of their age distribution shows an exponential decrease in the number of older stalagmites surviving to the present day. The age distribution indicates that the rate of natural attrition of stalagmites is approximately constant through time, probably in response to a number of natural processes, including downward erosion of the karst terrain, cave collapse, in-cave erosional processes and in-cave sedimentation covering stalagmites. Natural attrition of stalagmites is likely to be a general cave phenomenon, and has important implications for cave conservation because it highlights that random removal of stalagmites without prior knowledge of their ages will result in unnecessary replication and a failure to sample the full length of the available paleoclimate record.\nDeparture from this “normal” exponential profile can be used to infer palaeoclimate information: significant deviations are produced by periods of more frequent stalagmite growth, inferred here to reflect increases in monsoon rainfall over Sulawesi (345–340, 75–70 and 10–5 kyr BP). By adjusting the record to account for stalagmite attrition, more statistically robust paleoclimate information can be inferred.\nCrucially, these insights on past climates have been obtained entirely from reconnaissance-style basal mini-core ages. This novel technique is therefore suitable for caves where the removal of stalagmites would cause irreparable damage, or jeopardize local cultural and tourism potential.",

            "abstract": "Research over the last 35 years has demonstrated a substantial influence of deep-sea hydrothermal venting on seawater chemistry proximal to vent sites, but basin-scale hydrothermal effects are to date only hypothesized on the basis of limited seawater and sediment sampling downstream of vent sites. The U.S. GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect cruise investigated these potential long-range hydrothermal influences by sampling along the 15°S southern East Pacific Rise (EPR) plume, which is known to extend >4000 km from the EPR based on He-3 distributions. We present measurements of 30 particulate elements (>0.45 µm, filtered from GO-Flo bottles) at 11 stations along this transect. Concentrations of pFe and pMn peaked at 90 nM and 9 nM at 2425m above the EPR ridge axis (Sta 18), with no measurable back-transport to the east. A clear plume signature was detected at all stations from the ridge axis to the last station 4300 km to the west, where attenuated but background-distinguishable pFe and pMn peaks of 0.31 and 0.11 nM persisted at 2500m (Sta 36). Notably, the pMn peak appeared slightly deeper than the pFe peak near-field, and distal pMn decreased faster than pFe, a prime example of variable particle composition and settling behavior along the plume. The oxyanions pV (377 pM max) and pP (20 nM max) and particle-reactive pNd (2.42 pM max) all showed strong correlations with pFe and similarly remained enriched at distal stations, suggesting scavenging by Fe oxyhydroxides. The chalcophiles pCu (0.27 nM), pZn (75 pM), pCd (0.35 pM), and pCo (5.7 pM) were all enhanced near-field but, except pCu, reached background concentrations by Sta 23, indicating that sulfide particles either preferentially settle or dissolve early in plume evolution. Elevated pCu, in contrast, persisted throughout the sampled plume length. No elevated pAl, pTi, or pNi was evident in the hydrothermal plume, yet a substantial nepheloid layer with high concentrations of crustally-dominated elements was detected from 4000m to near-bottom depths >5000m in the westernmost section (Sta 32 and 36). Further physical and chemical characterization and modeling of this 4300-km particulate hydrothermal plume will help reveal what combination of size, density, and chemical speciation permits such long-range hydrothermal particle transport in the South Pacific.",

            "abstract": "We present methods for normalizing fan aggradation time-series by coupling radiocarbon dating of alluvial fan deposits with analysis of high resolution elevation data, which yield catchment-averaged denudation rates for small, steep catchments within the semi-arid montane Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, located within the Idaho Batholith of the Northern Rockies. Alluvial fan deposits are useful for understanding past landscape response to fire, and relationships among erosional processes and climate variability. However, although radiocarbon dating of alluvial stratigraphy provides a time-series of fan aggradation, which reflect catchment erosion rates, fan deposition is also influenced by catchment size and depositional confinement, which complicates comparisons of aggradation rates among catchments. Modern high resolution elevation data facilitate measurement of fan and catchment geometries, which we use to convert fan aggradation rates into catchment erosion rates. Airborne LiDAR point clouds were iteratively processed to produce optimal 1 and 0.5 m resolution elevation data for delineation of landforms. Alluvial fan 3-D surface areas were reconstructed by fitting conical surfaces through fan surface remnants. Aggradation time-series were converted to volumetric deposition by extrapolating surface-normal sample depths across reconstructed fan surfaces. Normalizing volumetric deposition by the 3-D surface areas of respective source catchments yielded catchment-averaged denudation time-series, with rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.016 mm/yr during the Holocene for a range of catchments of various size, aspect, and vegetation cover. These erosion rates span time periods between 500-8,000 cal. yr. BP, and are intermediary to short-term (10-84 yr) rates of 0.001 to 0.01 mm/yr and long-term (5,000-27,000 yr, and 10 m.y.) rates of 0.02 to 0.15 mm/yr previously established in the region. This suggests the method is viable for measuring erosional time-series for catchments in steep mountainous terrain, where the dominant erosional processes are related to wildfire and produce, and are recorded in, alluvial fan deposits. This work will facilitate ongoing comparisons of fire and erosional time-series among catchments of varying size, relief, elevation, aspect, and vegetation cover.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is a critical component of healthy soils. It improves soil structure, increases aeration, water infiltration, water holding capacity, and nutrient cycling. Increasing the SOM pools of soils has been repeatedly identified as a carbon (C) sequestration strategy to mitigating climate change. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to SOM stabilization is limited, particularly in agricultural ecosystems where significant potential for C sequestration exists. Roots and shoots fundamentally differ in their ability to contribute to SOM formation both in litter quality and in the soil depths they impact. Roots are primary contributors to SOM, particularly in the deep soil, due to fine root turnover and exudation and proximity to the soil matrix. In agriculture, roots are often the primary organic matter input to the system after aboveground materials are harvested. Litter quality, such as differences in C to N ratio and % lignin, is a critical factor in the early stages of decomposition, but its relevance to SOM formation has been questioned in recent years. The recently proposed Microbial Efficiency - Matrix Stabilization hypothesis states that more labile substrates are rapidly incorporated into microbial biomass based on the stoichiometric needs of the microbes, and therefore less C is lost from the system as CO2. Thus, more labile compounds are primary contributors to SOM. In order to address these differences in roots versus shoots, we have designed an experiment to answer the following questions: 1) how does initial quality of the root litter versus shoot litter lead to differences in the efficiency with which they are decomposed and incorporated into SOM; and 2) how does root contribution to SOM formation change as rooting depth increases? We combined 13C and 15N stable isotope enrichment of the litter with an innovative in situ decomposition method in order to accurately quantify root and shoot contribution to SOM up to 90cm soil depth. The isotopic enrichment allows us to trace the movement of decomposition products (root-derived C and N) to physical soil organic matter fractions (such as aggregates, light fraction and mineral fractions), informing us on the flow and likely stability of C and N over time. We will present data on the first harvest of a two-year experiment.",

Specifically, we examined seasonal and inter-annual variability in utilization of three major inorganic nutrients (nitrate and nitrite, phosphate, silicate) by spring phytoplankton blooms and potential drivers responsible for shaping those variations, using a 20-year time series (1992-2012) near Palmer Station on the wAP. Seasonal and inter-annual covariability in the 50-m depth integrated nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Chl) was analyzed using principle component analysis. We found no linear trends in any of the nutrients or Chl, but there were strong year-to-year fluctuations in seasonal nutrient drawdown and phytoplankton blooms. On average, Chl peaked around days 290-310, stayed high for ca. 40 days, and gradually decreased to the end of the growing season (March-April). Nitrate and nitrite and phosphate behaved in the opposite way of chl-a indicating biological utilization by phytoplankton, but silicate was not utilized in all years, implying non-diatom blooms. Annual anomalies showed a cyclic pattern in Chl, with a maximum occurring every four to six years on average. These years were found to be associated with the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in preceding winter. Our results suggest large-scale climate variability as a potential driver of biological utilization of nutrients and phytoplankton blooms.",

            "abstract": "Environment Canada is developing an autonomous tropospheric ozone and aerosol lidar system for deployment in support of short-term field studies. Tropospheric ozone and aerosols (PM10 and PM2.5) are important atmospheric constituents in low altitude pollution affecting human health and vegetation. Ozone is photo-chemically active with nitrogen oxides and can have a distinct diurnal variability. Aerosols contribute to the radiative budget, are a tracer for pollution transport, undergo complex mixing, and contribute to visibility and cloud formation. This particular instrument will employ two separate lidar transmitter and receiver assemblies. The tropospheric ozone lidar, based on the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique, uses the fourth harmonics of a Nd:YAG laser directed into a CO2 Raman cell to produce 276 nm, 287nm and 299 nm (first to third Stokes lines) output wavelengths. The aerosol lidar is based on the 3+2 design using a tripled Nd:YAG to output 355 nm, 532 nm and 1064nm wavelengths. Both lidars will be housed in a modified cargo trailer allowing for easy deployment to remote areas. The unit can be operated and monitored 24 hours a day via an internet link and requires an external power source. Simultaneous ozone and aerosol lidar measurements will provide the vertical context necessary to understand the complex mixing and transformation of pollutants - particularly when deployed near other ground-based in-situ sensors. Preliminary results will be shown from a summer field study at the Centre For Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE).",

            "abstract": "Land Use decisions in the local community are well represented in geoscience topics and issues, and provide an excellent opportunity to showcase a wide range of geoscience careers to high school students. In PLUS (Planning Land Use with Students) we work with youth corps, volunteer agencies and the County Departments of Planning, Transportation, Public Health, Water Resources to run a program for high school seniors to engage the students in the complex layers of decision making connected with land use as we showcase geoscience careers (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/plus/index.html). How development occurs, what resources are in use and who makes these decisions is both interesting and relevant for students.\nWe develop case studies around current, active, local land use issues large enough in scale to have a formal environmental review at the County and/or the State level. Sections of each case study are dedicated to addressing the range of environmental issues that are central to each land use decision. Water, its availability, planned use and treatment on the site, brings in both a review of local hydrology and a discussion of storm water management. Air quality and the impact of the proposed project’s density, transportation plans, and commercial and industrial uses brings in air quality issues like air quality ratings, existing pollution, and local air monitoring. A review of the site plans brings in grading plans for the project area, which highlights issues of drainage, soil stability, and exposure to toxins or pollutants depending on the historic use of the site. Brownfield redevelopments are especially challenging with various monitoring, clean up and usage restrictions that are extremely interesting to the students.\nStudents’ work with mentors from the community who represent various roles in the planning process including a range of geosciences, community business members and other players in the planning process. This interplay of individuals provides a realistic look at the forces that move land use decision-making in a community. Discussion of impacts and mitigations highlight the intersection of policy and science. Debate arises on how much science should guide policy and how much land use policy decisions require science monitoring, pushing new scientific developments.",

This work uses a sophisticated algorithm developed to analyze separately the different populations - core, halo and strahl - of the electron velocity distribution function (eVDF) up to 'super-halo' energies (2 keV). The code determines their respective set of parameters through fits to the measured eVDF, taking properly into account spacecraft charging and other instrumental effects. We use here several years (half a solar cycle, approximately 1.5 million of independent measurements) of core, halo and strahl electron parameters to investigate the properties of these different populations and the physical processe(s) that likely act to control and regulate them.\nWe discuss new results obtained on (1) the electron temperature anisotropies and their variation with collisions and/or solar wind fluctuations and instabilities, (2) the properties of core and halo drifts in the solar wind proton frame, (3) the electron heat flux, and (4) the electron strahl. These new observations emphasize the non-negligible role of Coulomb collisions in shaping the electron distribution function and regulating of the thermal and supra thermal electrons, but that the solar wind electron expansion and compression are limited fundamentally by some instabilities under certain conditions.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century in the circumpolar north, changes in vegetation include shrub cover expansion and shifts in tree line. Invasion of tundra by trees and shrubs may be further facilitated by wildfire disturbance, which creates opportunities for establishment where recruitment is otherwise rare. Even moderate increases in warm-season temperatures are predicted to increase the likelihood of tundra fires. Understanding the consequences of a change in fire regime are complicated by the fact that there are relatively few large recent fires to study. However, the Seward Peninsula is a region that currently experiences more frequent and large fires than other tundra regions in Arctic Alaska. In this tundra region, there are areas of overlapping burns dating back to the 1970s. Using a chronosequence approach, we looked at post-fire biomass accumulation as well as foliar and soil C and N. Our experimental design incorporated sites that showed no evidence of recent burning, sites that burned in 1971, 1997, 2002, and 2011 as well as sites that burned multiple times over the last 30 years. We found that fire had a significant effect on total biomass and shrub basal area in tussock tundra. Our site that burned in 2011 had the lowest total biomass, about half of the biomass of our unburned site. However, our results indicated the site that burned in 1971 had over double the aboveground biomass and more soil N than the unburned site. We found that sites that repeatedly burned since 1971 were very similar in biomass to unburned tundra. This suggests that repeat fires keep a post-fire site at unburned levels of biomass. However, in these repeat fire sites, foliar C/N was ~25% greater and soil C and N was ~50% less than in unburned tundra. These results indicate that repeat fires are potentially causing nitrogen loss that not likely to be replenished into the system. As tundra fires become more frequent prediction of post-fire ecosystem effects is critical due to impacts on wildlife habitat, permafrost degradation, carbon release, and range expansion of species from the neighboring boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "Water footprints have been proposed as potential sustainability indicators, but these analyses have thus far focused at the country-level or regional scale. However, for many countries, especially the United States, the most relevant level of water decision-making is the city. For water footprinting to inform urban sustainability, the boundaries for analysis must match the relevant boundaries for decision-making and economic development.\nInitial studies into city-level water footprints have provided insight into how large cities across the globe—Delhi, Lagos, Berlin, Beijing, York—create virtual water trade linkages with distant hinterlands. This study hypothesizes that for large cities the most direct and manageable virtual water flows exist at the metropolitan area scale and thus should provide the most policy-relevant information.\nThis study represents an initial attempt at quantifying intra-metropolitan area virtual water flows. A modified commodity-by-industry input-output model was used to determine virtual water flows destined to, occurring within, and emanating from the Phoenix metropolitan area (PMA). Virtual water flows to and from the PMA were calculated for each PMA city using water consumption data as well as economic and industry statistics. Intra-PMA virtual water trade was determined using county-level traffic flow data, water consumption data, and economic and industry statistics. The findings show that there are archetypal cities within metropolitan areas and that each type of city has a distinct water footprint profile that is related to the value added economic processes occuring within their boundaries. These findings can be used to inform local water managers about the resilience of outsourced water supplies.",

PolarHub is a machine robot; its goal is to visit as many webpages as possible to find those containing information about polar OWS, extract this information and store it into the backend data repository. This is a very challenging task given huge data volume of webpages on the Web. Three unique features was introduced in PolarHub to make it distinctive from earlier crawler solutions: (1) a multi-task, multi-user, multi-thread support to the crawling tasks; (2) an extensive use of thread pool and Data Access Object (DAO) design patterns to separate persistent data storage and business logic to achieve high extendibility of the crawler tool; (3) a pattern-matching based customizable crawling algorithm to support discovery of multi-type geospatial web services; and (4) a universal and portable client-server communication mechanism combining a server-push and client pull strategies for enhanced asynchronous processing. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the impact of crawling parameters to the overall system performance. The geographical distribution pattern of all PolarHub identified services is also demonstrated. We expect this work to make a major contribution to the field of geospatial information retrieval and geospatial interoperability, to bridge the gap between data provider and data consumer, and to accelerate polar science by enhancing the accessibility and reusability of adequate polar data.",

            "abstract": "Active margins are dominated by erosion, structural deformation, tectonic dissection, and igneous intrusions. These destructive processes lead to an incomplete record of past magmatism in active margins. Volcanic airfall tuffs that are transported and deposited in distal sedimentary basins may be more likely to be preserved in the rock record. Tuffs, however, may be affected by atmospheric fractionation during transport, postdepositional weathering, and diagenesis during burial, potentially altering ash texture, mineralogy, and geochemistry. We use outcrop observations, stratigraphic relationships, whole rock geochemistry, U-Pb zircon geochronology, and zircon rare-earth element geochemistry from Permian-Triassic strata of South Africa and South America to correlate distal volcanic ashes to proximal volcanic deposits and plutonic suites within southern Gondwana. U-Pb zircon signals of the tuffs are treated as \"detrital\"; the distinct zircon signals were then used to correlate distal airfall ashes to potential magmatic sources. This suggests that airfall fractionation of zircon populations is not a significant concern in tuff geochronology. Additionally, zircon inheritance may be a useful tool in matching far-traveled ashes with parental magmatic suites. Although previous studies have shown that the geochemistry of volcanic tuff deposits varies with distance from the volcanic vent, we employ whole rock and zircon REE compositions to differentiate distinct magmatic periods using distal ashes that were deposited >750 km from the volcanic source.  The results of this study support a geochronologic interpretation that the Karoo strata of S. Africa are >10 Ma younger than previously thought based on biostratigraphy. Since the Karoo basin is heavily studied as a record of the end-Permian extinction and paleoclimate change, our results have major implication for this key time in Earth History.",

Stable water isotope and electrical conductivity tracer event water fraction estimations agree well during small runoff events, but exhibit different results during a large runoff event with a greater runoff coefficient.

Telepresence increases the potential pace and scope of ocean exploration by enabling experts to join an expedition from anywhere, providing unlimited access to intellectual capital, while simultaneously expanding the reach of ocean science expeditions to public audiences worldwide. “America’s Ship for Ocean Exploration”, NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, is the first and only federal vessel purpose-outfitted for conducting telepresence-enabled ocean exploration. As a platform for testing new technologies and methodologies, her primary operating paradigm focuses on using telepresence to enable the majority of expedition scientists to participate and guide explorations from shore in real-time. Between 2010-2014, NOAA and partners implemented different models to conduct telepresence-enabled ocean exploration on NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, all with the majority of the participating expedition scientists located on shore. These expeditions tested different scientist participation models, communication technologies, operating procedures, internet video streams, data distribution methods, and internet-based collaboration tools, and provided varying levels of real-time access to ongoing expeditions. Each expedition provided new insights into what makes remote science participation “work”, and identified challenges that remain to be overcome. This presentation will provide an overview of the different methods and tools used by NOAA’s Okeanos Explorer Program to enable remote science participation in expeditions over the last five years, highlighting successes, lessons learned, and challenges for the future.",

            "abstract": "The success of Terra-based observations using the ASTER instrument of active volcanic processes early in the mission gave rise to a funded NASA program designed to both increase the number of ASTER observations following an eruption and validate the satellite data. The urgent request protocol (URP) system for ASTER grew out of this initial study and has now operated in conjunction with and the support of the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the University of Hawaii, the USGS Land Processes DAAC, and the ASTER science team. The University of Pittsburgh oversees this rapid response/sensor-web system, which until 2011 had focused solely on the active volcanoes in the North Pacific region. Since that time, it has been expanded to operate globally with AVHRR and MODIS and now ASTER VNIR/TIR data are being acquired at numerous erupting volcanoes around the world. This program relies on the increased temporal resolution of AVHRR/MODIS midwave infrared data to trigger the next available ASTER observation, which results in ASTER data as frequently as every 2-5 days. For many targets, the URP has increased the observational frequency over active eruptions by as much 50%. The data have been used for operational response to new eruptions, longer-term scientific studies such as capturing detailed changes in lava domes/flows, pyroclastic flows and lahars. These data have also been used to infer the emplacement of new lava lobes, detect endogenous dome growth, and interpret hazardous dome collapse events. The emitted TIR radiance from lava surfaces has also been used effectively to model composition, texture and degassing. Now, this long-term archive of volcanic image data is being mined to provide statistics on the expectations of future high-repeat TIR data such as that proposed for the NASA HyspIRI mission. In summary, this operational/scientific program utilizing the unique properties of ASTER and the Terra mission has shown the potential for providing innovative and integrated synoptic measurements of geothermal activity, volcanic eruptions and their subsequent hazards globally.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in 3D diffusion codes for the high energy electron radiation belt have shown that the model representation of microphysical processes in terms of diffusion coefficients, capturing radial, energy and pitch-angle diffusion (including mixed diffusion terms) is quite capable of capturing the dynamics and physics of the radiation belt system, while remaining computationally tractable; making these codes an ideal candidate for operational application. However, we hold that the major obstacle to a realistic application of such codes for now- or forecasting is our insufficient knowledge of drivers and inputs to these codes - rather than any additional improved physics in the codes. These include the specification of the initial conditions, knowledge of the background plasma distribution, the global distribution of waves, the low-energy boundary condition and the outer boundary condition.\n In this talk we will discuss realistic and affordable strategies of specifying these inputs through the use of proxies, ground based measurement techniques and data assimilative methods; present examples of where this is already possible (outer boundary and global chorus wave and plasma density specification), and outline where additional effort is needed.\n Finally we present an example of using such realistic model drivers in a state-of-the-art 3D diffusion code which demonstrates a remarkable ability of such codes to reproduce the observed dynamics - by simply using the existing physics in the code but providing the \"correct\" drivers and boundary conditions.",

            "abstract": "Step-pools are important features in fluvial systems. Through energy dissipation, step-pools provide stability in high-energy environments that otherwise may erode and degrade. Although research has focused on geomorphological aspects of step-pool channels, the ecological significance of step-pool streams is increasingly recognized. Step-pool streams often contain higher density and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates and are critical habitats for organisms such as salmonids and tailed frogs. Step-pools are therefore increasingly used to restore eroding channels and improve ecological conditions. This paper addresses a restoration reach of Wildcat Creek in Berkeley, California that featured an installation of step-pools in 2012. The design framework recognized step-pool formation as a self-organizing process that produces a rhythmic morphology. After placing step particles at locations where step-pools are expected to form according to hydraulic theory, the self-organizing approach allowed fluvial processes to refine the rocks into adjusted sequences over time. In addition, a 30-meter \"experimental\" reach was created to explore the co-evolution of geomorphological and ecological characteristics. After constructing a plane bed channel, boulders and cobbles piled at the upstream end allowed natural flows to mobilize and sort them into step-pool sequences. Ground surveys and LiDAR recorded the development of step-pool sequences over several seasons. Concurrent sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates documented the formation of biological communities in conjunction with habitat. Biological sampling in an upstream reference reach provided a comparison with the restored reach over time. Results to date show an emergent step-pool channel with steps that segment the plane bed into initial step and pool habitats. Biological communities are beginning to form, showing more distinction among habitat types during some seasons, although they do not yet approach reference values at this stage of development. Research over longer timeframes is needed to reveal how biological and physical characteristics may co-organize toward an equilibrium landscape. Such integrated understanding will assist development of innovative restoration designs.",

            "abstract": "In previous studies, we pseudo-prospectively evaluated time-dependent Coulomb stress earthquake forecasts, based on rate-and-state friction (Toda and Enescu, 2011 and Dieterich, 1996), against an ETAS null hypothesis (Zhuang et al., 2002). At the 95% confidence interval, we found that the stress-based forecast failed to outperform the ETAS forecast during the first eight weeks following the 10/16/1999 Hector Mine earthquake, in both earthquake number and spatial distribution. The rate-and-state forecast was most effective in forecasting far-field events (earthquakes occurring at least 50km away from modeled active faults). Near active faults, where most aftershocks occurred, stress singularities arising from modeled fault section boundaries obscured the Coulomb stress field. In addition to yielding physically unrealistic stress quantities, the stress singularities arising from the slip model often failed to indicate potential fault asperity locations inferred from aftershock distributions. Here, we test the effects of these stress singularities on the rate-and-state forecast’s effectiveness, as well as mitigate stress uncertainties near active faults. We decrease the area significantly impacted by stress singularities by increasing the number of fault patches and introducing tapered slip at fault section boundaries, representing displacement as a high-resolution step function. Using recent seismicity distributions to relocate fault asperities, we also invert seismicity for a fault displacement model with higher resolution than the original slip distribution, where areas of positive static Coulomb stress change coincide with earthquake locations.",

            "abstract": "High spatial density geochemical data sets from the N-EPR and S-JdFR are used to re-evaluate the across-axis geochemical variations in major and trace elements at mid-ocean ridges (MORs). At two axial melt lens (AML) segments, north and south, at the 9-10°N EPR, N-MORB MgO varies across-axis from the most primitive above the AML to more evolved away from the axis. This trend is distinct at the northern (magmatically more robust) segment with an axial MgO range of 8-9 wt% and off-axis (>2km) range of 6.5-8 wt%. This decrease is also reflected in E-MORB MgO variation. There is more variability at the southern segment but, off-axis progression to more evolved MgO is still evident. Interestingly, the Cleft segment, JdFR, displays similar geochemical behavior to the EPR with an axial MgO range of 7-8.5 wt% and off-axis (>2km) range of 6-7.5 wt%.\nEPR geochemical studies over the past 30 years have described models of upper crustal accumulation ranging from eruptions limited to the axis, to temporal variation in the composition of magma in the AML, to multiple eruption sites across the ridge crest and flanks (<5km). Eruptions limited to the axis, with topographically controlled flow off-axis, cannot reproduce the observed off-axis change to more evolved N-MORB. Time-dependence could explain one instance of evolved lavas off-axis but, similar geochemical behavior is observed at two separate AML segments. Multiple instances of consistent compositional variability at multiple AML segments, and at different ridges, point to a common process of crustal accretion at MORs.\nIn light of recent geophysical discoveries of Off-axis AMLs (OAMLs) at the EPR and JdFR, we propose that the trend of more evolved lavas for the majority of N-MORB lavas with distance from the axis is controlled by thermal distribution in the underlying crystal mush zone (CMZ). Higher magma flux beneath the axis facilitates higher temperatures and high porosity melt pathways, reducing crustal residence times, and erupting more primitive lava compositions. OAMLs at the edges of the CMZ, where it is cooler, feed more evolved off-axis eruptions. Lower magma flux at the edges increases crustal residence time and the extent to which magmas crystallize. OAMLs outside of the CMZ host magmas that may escaped any central mixing and erupt a greater range of compositions.",

            "abstract": "The NASA\nTHEMIS\nand\nARTEMIS\nsatellite missions study “space weather,” which describes the solar wind influence on Earth's protective magnetic shield, the magnetosphere. Space weather is important to study and predict because it can damage critical GPS and communications satellites, harm space travelers, and even disable our global electrical grid. The Planeterrella is an innovative heliophysics outreach demonstration, expanding public awareness of space weather by visualizing the sun-Earth connection up close and in-person. Using a glass vacuum chamber, two magnetized spheres and a 1kV power supply, the device can simulate plasma configurations of the solar corona, solar wind, Van Allen radiation belts, and auroral ovals, all of which are observable only by satellites. This \"aurora in a bottle” is a modernized version of the original Terrella built by Kristian Birkeland in the 1890s to show that the aurora are electrical in nature. Adapted from plans by\nLilensten et al.\nat CNRS-IPAG, the UCLA Planeterrella was completed in Nov. 2013, the second device of its kind in the U.S., and the centerpiece of the THEMIS/ARTEMIS mobile public outreach exhibit. In combination with captivating posters, 3D magnetic field models, dazzling aurora videos and magnetosphere animations, the Planeterrella has already introduced over 1200 people to the electrical link between our sun and the planets. Most visitors had seen solar flare images in the news, however the Planeterrella experience enhanced their appreciation of the dynamic solar wind and its effects on Earth's invisible magnetic field. Most importantly, visitors young and old realized that magnets are not just cool toys or only for powering hybrid car motors and MRIs, they are a fundamental aspect of ongoing life on Earth and are key to the formation and evolution of planets, moons, and stars, extending far beyond our galaxy to other planetary systems throughout the universe. Novel visualizations such as the Planeterrella can significantly increase awareness of space weather and act as a catalyst for the pursuit of STEM careers by allowing students to form a personalized, emotional connection to the incredible phenomena surrounding our planet. This can translate into greater support for the heliophysics satellite infrastrucure that safeguards our modern society.",

            "abstract": "The Walvis Ridge-Tristan/Gough seamount province in the South Atlantic represents 130 Myr of continuous intra-plate volcanism that can be connected to the once conjunct Parana-Etendeka flood basalt province. With this it represents one of the few primary hotspots consistent with the thermal plume model. However, around 60 Ma, the morphological expression of the Walvis Ridge changed drastically from a robust 200 km wide aseismic ridge into a 400 km wide region of diffuse and diminished volcanism. As a result, this part of the plume trail has been described by two subtracks, one ending at Tristan da Cunha and another at Gough Island more than 400 km to the SSE. Where the Walvis Ridge forks into these two tracks there is a center prong. There is also the 39.5°S lineament of seamounts between, but oblique to, the two subtracks, which is parallel to the local fracture zone directions. All these features are at odds with the classical definition of a narrow hotspot track although Rohde et al. (2013) showed that the Tristan and Gough subtracks retain a distinct geochemical signature over 70 Myr and are consistent with a zoned, deep-seated plume.\nThe first Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic and trace element analyses from the detailed dredge sampling cruise MV1203 show that samples from two prominent seamounts at the western end of the 39.5°S lineament have a Gough-type signature, which makes an upper mantle source for this lineament unlikely but rather indicates that the Gough-type source stretches some 200 km NNW from Gough. Tristan track seamount samples are comparable with published data, however, one new sample has a Gough-type composition suggesting leakage of this component into the Tristan-type plume zone. Seamounts on the middle prong of the Walvis Ridge fork have compositions intermediate to Gough and Tristan domains, suggesting mixing between sources or melts of the two domains.\nThus, the Gough-component in the last 60 Myr of plume activity is volumetrically much more significant than previously apparent in only a small number of seamounts with this signature. A spread over much of the width of the seamount province is indicated including some leakage into the Tristan track.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the properties and behaviors of materials and multi-phase aggregates under conditions of high pressure and temperature is vital to unraveling the mysteries that lie beneath the surface of the planet. Advances in in situexperimental techniques using synchrotron radiation at these extreme conditions have helped to provide answers to fundamental questions that were previously unattainable. Synchrotron-based ultrasonic interferometry measurements have proven to be especially important in determining acoustic velocities and thermoelastic properties of materials at high pressures and temperatures. However, due to relatively slow data collection times, it has been difficult to measure the effects of processes as they occur, and instead the measurement is made on the end product of these processes. DIASCoPE is an important step toward addressing this problem.\nOver the last three years, we have designed and developed an on-board ultrasonic acoustic velocity measurement system that cuts data collection time down by over an order of magnitude. We can now measure P- and S-wave travel times in samples at extreme conditions in less than one second. Moreover, the system has been fully integrated with the multi-anvil apparatus and the EPICS control system at beamline X17B2 of the National Synchrotron Light Source, allowing for greater ease of control andfull automation of experimental data collection. The DIASCoPE has completed the testing and commissioning phase, and the first data collected using this powerful new system will be presented here.\nDIASCoPE represents a major step forward in acoustic velocity collection time reduction that will finally allow us to begin to witness what effects various processes in the deep Earth may have on the physical properties of materials at extreme conditions as they occur. These new capabilities will allow us to change the focus of study from the product to the process itself and will lead to a greater understanding of the materials and processes that shape the Earth and other terrestrial planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami deposits are recordings of tsunami events, containing the information about the flow conditions during events. Deciphering quantitative information from the deposits is especially important for paleo events where deposits are the only left-over physical evidence. Inversion of the flow conditions has been attempted in the past. One summarizing conclusion from the different inversion models is that it is a difficult endeavor, and the physical meaning of the inverted quantities depends on the physical assumptions that are applied. The aim of our study is to relate the time-varying characteristics of tsunamis with the deposits, and quantify the error and uncertainty that go with it. For this, we combine TsuSpeedv1 for the deposition with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnkF) method to study the deposition of an idealized deposit by one tsunami wave. In our modeling, we assume that information from the idealized deposit at different depths within the deposits can be used as observations, and the coupling between TsuSpeedv1 and EnkF allows us to correct for the different flow conditions causing deposition as the tsunami travels over a certain area. Applying an idealized deposit enables us to study the uncertainty and error that accompanies the inversion process by, for example, varying the number of unknown variables that we aim to invert, or how many observations are available, among others. Our tentative results indicate that sampling methods and sampling frequencies of tsunami deposit influence not only the magnitude of the inverted variables, but also their error and uncertainty. An interesting result of our technique is that a larger number of samples from a given tsunami deposits does not automatically mean that the inversion of, for example, flow speed and flow depth is more robust with smaller error and decreased uncertainty. The same also holds for the number of measured grain-size classes in the deposits. From a more general viewpoint, these two examples indicate that the gap between results from modeling and fieldwork needs to be narrowed or closed because only together more robust inversion can be achieved. In this sense, researchers focusing on fieldwork must understand more about modeling, and more theoretical researchers must better comprehend the limitations and constraints of fieldwork. ",

Several hundred Mastcam multispectral observations have been acquired to date, documenting a diversity of visible to near-infrared spectral behavior observed along Curiosity’s traverse toward the base of Mt. Sharp. These observations include both near-field images of materials in or near the rover workspace and also observations targeted towards the more distant central mound. Near-field observations document both outcrop and float rocks, the latter of which may include both local material as well as material transported from nearer the crater rim. Far-field observations of the central mound include the lower and upper layers of the mound as well as the encircling dune field, both of which have been noted in published studies to exhibit spectral variability in the visible to near-infrared from orbital spectral data. Float rocks with spectra distinct from local outcrops may have spectral matches at locations observed only from orbit, suggesting potential source regions. Furthermore, ground-based Mastcam observations may help “ground-truth” orbital data and in turn benefit from orbital predictions of spectral diversity along the future rover traverse. We present comparisons of CRISM and Mastcam multispectral observations of Gale Crater materials to better interpret observed spectral diversity and anticipate areas of likely opportunities for observations of spectral diversity.",

They are mainly soil particles that originate from arid\nand semiarid regions of the world that can be carried by winds for thousands of\nkilometers. They are a major impediment in the remote sensing of the ocean\ncolor (spectral water-leaving reflectance), because they absorb solar radiation\nin the UV and visible part of the spectrum and their micro-physical and optical\nproperties are highly variable. Further, there are no reliable working\nalgorithms to detect their presence from spaceborne ocean color observations\nalone, when they are present in small amount (optical thickness < 0.2).\nIn this paper we examine effect of mineral dust on ocean color retrieval from\nspace. We use Ahmad-Fraser’s vector radiative transfer (RT) code (v3.0) for\nocean-atmosphere system to simulate the pseudo observations (top of atmosphere\nradiance) for models containing different types of aerosols (absorbing and\nnon-absorbing) in the atmosphere. We consider the mineral aerosols as consisting\nof an external mixture of illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, quartz, and\ncalcite with a small amount of hematite (as an internal mixture), which provide\nthe spectral dependence of single scattering albedo consistent with the values\nreported in the literature. We also vary the aerosol layer height in the\natmosphere and amount of chlorophyll in the ocean. The simulated pseudo\nobservations were processed through standard NASA algorithms to determine the\nocean color (spectral water-leaving reflectance) and derived chlorophyll in the\nocean. Results of the RT simulation study for different Sun-satellite viewing\ngeometry, aerosol layer height and chlorophyll amount in the ocean is presented.",

            "abstract": "One of the outstanding challenges of field geology is inaccessibility of exposure. The ability to view and characterize outcrops that are difficult to study from the ground is greatly improved by aerial investigation. Detailed stratigraphic architecture of such exposures is best addressed by using advances and availability of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) that can safely navigate from high-altitude overviews of study areas to within a meter of the exposure of interest. High-resolution photographs acquired at various elevations and azimuths by sUAS are then used to convert field measurements to digital representations in three-dimensions at a fine scale. Photogrammetric software is used to capture complex, detailed topography by creating digital surface models with a range imaging technique that estimates three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences. The digital surface model is overlain by detailed, high-resolution photography. Pairing sUAS technology with readily available photogrammetry software that requires little processing time and resources offers a revolutionary and cost-effective methodology for geoscientists to investigate and quantify stratigraphic and structural complexity of field studies from the convenience of the office.\nThese methods of imaging and modeling remote outcrops are demonstrated in the East Coast Basin, New Zealand, where wave-cut platform exposures of Miocene deep-water deposits offer a unique opportunity to investigate the flow processes and resulting characteristics of thin-bedded turbidite deposits. Stratigraphic architecture of wavecut platform and vertically-dipping exposures of these thin-bedded turbidites is investigated with sUAS coupled with Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry software. This approach allows the geometric and spatial variation of deep-water architecture to be characterized continuously along 2,000 meters of lateral exposure, as well as to measure and quantify cyclic variations in thin-bedded turbidites at centimeter scale. Results yield a spatial and temporal understanding of a deep-water depositional system at a scale that was previously unattainable using conventional field geology techniques, and a virtual outcrop that can be used for classroom education.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are key drivers of anthropogenic climate change. It is hence not surprising that current and emerging U.S. governmental science priorities and programs focused on climate change (e.g. a U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan; the U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Program, the U.S. Global Change Research Program, Executive Order 13653 'Preparing the U.S. for the Impacts of Climate Change') all call for an improved understanding of these sources and sinks.. Measurements of the total atmospheric burden of these gases are well established, but measurements of their sources and sinks are difficult to make over spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for scientific and decisionmaking needs. Quantifying the uncertainty in these measurements is particularly challenging.\nThis talk reviews the intersection of the state of knowledge of GHG sources and sinks, focusing in particular on CO2 and CH4, and science and decision-making needs for this information. Different science and decision-making needs require differing levels of uncertainty. A number of high-priority needs (early detection of changes in the Earth system, projections of future climate, support of markets or regulations) often require a high degree of accuracy and/or precision. We will critically evaluate current U.S. planning to documents to infer current perceived needs for GHG source/sink quantification, attempting to translate these needs into quantitative uncertainty metrics. We will compare these perceived needs with the current state of the art of GHG source/sink quantification, including the apparent pattern of systematic differences between so-called “top down” and “bottom-up” flux estimates. This comparison will enable us to identify where needs can be readily satisfied, and where gaps in technology exist. Finally, we will examine what steps could be taken to close existing gaps.",

            "abstract": "Global general circulation models typically cannot provide the detailed and accurate regional climate information required by stakeholders for climate adaptation efforts, given their limited capacity to resolve the regional topography and changes in local sea surface temperature, wind and circulation patterns. The study region in Northwest Costa Rica has a tropical wet-dry climate with a double-peak wet season. During the dry season the central Costa Rican mountains prevent tropical Atlantic moisture from reaching the region. Most of the annual precipitation is received following the northward migration of the ITCZ in May that allows the region to benefit from moist southwesterly flow from the tropical Pacific. The wet season begins with a short period of “early rains” and is interrupted by the mid-summer drought associated with the intensification and westward expansion of the North Atlantic subtropical high in late June. Model projections for the 21st century indicate a lengthening and intensification of the mid-summer drought and a weakening of the early rains on which current crop cultivation practices rely.\nWe developed an expert elicitation to systematically address uncertainties in the available model projections of changes in the seasonal precipitation pattern. Our approach extends an elicitation approach developed previously at Carnegie Mellon University. Experts in the climate of the study region or Central American climate were asked to assess the mechanisms driving precipitation during each part of the season, uncertainties regarding these mechanisms, expected changes in each mechanism in a warming climate, and the capacity of current models to reproduce these processes. To avoid overconfidence bias, a step-by-step procedure was followed to estimate changes in the timing and intensity of precipitation during each part of the season. The questions drew upon interviews conducted with the regions stakeholders to assess their climate information needs.\nThis study is part of the FuturAgua project funded by the Belmont Freshwater Security call. The expert opinions on expected changes in the seasonal precipitation pattern are being used to inform regional efforts to build drought resilience and to create and compare alternative water management strategies with the region’s stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the feedbacks between water, sediment, and vegetation in deltas is an important part of understanding deltas as ecomorphodynamic systems. We conducted a set of laboratory experiments using alfalfa (Medicago sativa) as a proxy for delta vegetation to determine (1) the effects of plants on delta growth and channel dynamics and (2) the influence of fine material on delta evolution. Vegetated experiments were compared to a control run without plants to isolate the effects of vegetation, and experiments with fine sediment were compared to a set of similar experiments with only sand. We found that alfalfa increased sediment trapping on the delta topset, and that the plants were especially effective at retaining fine material. Compared to the control run, the vegetated experiments showed an increased retention of fine sediment on the floodplain that resulted in increased delta relief and stronger pulses of shoreline progradation when channel avulsion and migration occurred. In other words, a higher amount of sediment storage with the addition of vegetation corresponded to a higher amount of sediment excavation during channelization events. In natural systems, dense bank vegetation is typically expected to help confine flow. We seeded our delta uniformly, which eliminated typical vegetation density gradients from riverbank to island center and therefore diminished the gradient in overbank sedimentation that best confines channels by creating levees. Dense clusters of alfalfa throughout the interior of the floodplain and delta islands were therefore able to induce flow splitting, where channels diverged around a stand of plants. This created several smaller channels that were then able to more widely distribute sediment at the delta front compared to unvegetated experiments. We conclude that plants are efficient sediment trappers that change the rate and amount of sediment storage in the delta topset, and that gradients in vegetation density are an important factor in determining how channel behavior may change.",

            "abstract": "We present model simulations of climate change impacts on snowmelt processes over a 1600 km2 area in the southern Sierra Nevada, including western Sequoia National Park. The domain spans a 3600 m elevation gradient and ecosystems ranging from semi-arid grasslands to giant sequoia groves to alpine tundra. Three reference years were evaluated: a moderately dry snow season (23% below average SWE), an average snow season (7% above average SWE), and a moderately wet snow season (54% above average SWE). The Alpine3D model was run for the reference years and results were evaluated against data from a multi-scale measurement campaign that included repeated manual snow courses and basin-scale snow surveys, dozens of automated snow depth sensors, and automated SWE stations. Compared to automated measurements, the model represented the date of snow disappearance within two days. Compared to manual measurements, model SWE RMSE values for the average and wet snow seasons were highly correlated (R2=0.89 and R2=0.73) with the distance of SWE measurements from the nearest precipitation gauge used to force the model; no significant correlation was found with elevation. The results suggest that Alpine3D is highly accurate during the melt season and that precipitation uncertainty may critically limit snow model accuracy. The air temperature measured at 19 regional stations for the three reference years was modified by +1°C to +6°C to simulate the impact of warmer temperatures on snowmelt dynamics over the 3600 m elevation gradient. For all years, progressively warmer temperatures caused the seasonal SWE centroid to shift earlier and higher in elevation. At forested middle elevations, 70 – 80% of the present-day snowpack volume is lost in a +2°C scenario; 30 – 40% of that change is a result of precipitation phase shift and the remainder is due to enhanced melt. At all elevations, spring and fall snowpack was most sensitive to warmer temperatures; mid-winter sensitivity was least for elevations >3100 m. Interestingly, the dominant effect of warmer temperatures on snowmelt was a reduction in daily melt rates. The drier year was most sensitive to temperature changes with a greater decrease in the number of days with high melt rates. The results offer insight into the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to warmer temperatures in the Sierra Nevada.",

There is however a demand for moderate spatial resolution burned area maps that are systematically generated at regional to global scale. This paper presents a multi-temporal methodology to fuse the MODIS 1km active fire product with Landsat data to map burned areas at 30m on a temporally rolling basis. A multistage mapping approach is used, with an initial per-pixel change detection on Landsat 30m time series to identify candidate burned areas. The candidate burned area objects are then either retained or discarded by comparison with contemporaneous MODIS active fire detections. Results are illustrated showing 30m burned area maps of the conterminous United States and Alaska for two years (2002 and 2008) generated from weekly Web Enabled Landsat (WELD) Landsat mosaics and daily Terra and Aqua MODIS active fire detections. Validation is conducted by systematic comparison with all the fire perimeter vectors provided by the USGS Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. The presented methodology pathfinds the use of the Landsat archive to contribute to a long term burned area data record. Prospects for future developments and global application are discussed.",

Thus, the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) can be thought of as a large contiguous area, in which most air columns have crossed over this moisture threshold. What processes dictate how this threshold is crossed at intraseasonal timescales?\nTo begin answering this, we introduce a Lagrangian perspective on the column moisture budget of the MJO. As opposed to conventional Eulerian metrics, a Lagrangian perspective allows us to consider moistening processes with respect to air columns that are being advected by the flow. Techniques are introduced for estimating the column moisture tendencies using analysis and satellite observations, and estimates are compared for validation. We then examine how the critical column moisture threshold can influence how we think about MJO dynamics. Implications for MJO compositing methods will also be discussed.",

Matlab is stratigraphically composed of thick floodplain deposits of Holocene age overlying Plio-Pleistocene grey fine to coarse sands with considerable clay (Dupi Tila). The dissolved As concentrations in the studied area ranged from <1 to 3644 µg/l and more than 70% of functioning tubewells exceeded the WHO guideline of 10 µg/l. To test the hypothesis that young labile organic carbon (LOC) accelerates As release in reducing aquifer systems as long as As-bearing iron oxides/hydroxides are available, we collected 19 groundwater (depths from 14 to 240 m) and 9 surface water (8 pond and 1 canal in proximity to the piezeometer nests) samples from 4 nests in north and south Matlab, respectively, during monsoon months (Jun-Jul, 2014). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (e.g., E. coli) counts using field ColilertTM test kits were undertaken to understand the chemical character and potential sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater and surface waters. DOC concentrations were high (1.5-12.2 mg/l) in shallow aquifers (14-33 m) where dissolved As ranged from 100-500 µg/l. DOC concentrations were lower (0.7-4.2 mg/l) in intermediate to deeper depths (52-240 m) with lower As concentrations of 0-50 µg/l. In surface water bodies, the range of DOC was 2.9-8.1 mg/l. MPN based analyses for both ground and surface waters indicate the frequency of E. coli detection in shallow well waters (MPN= 3.6-74.1) was high as well as in ponds and canals (MPN= 8.5-433.4). Microbial activity in groundwater was lower than in unprotected surface waters. Freshness index (β:α), humification index (HIX), fluorescence source index (FI) values showed that DOM in shallow and surface water bodies was distinct from deep groundwater. Concurrent with the lower DOC in deeper wells, the overall fluorescence intensities decreased with depth. The results thus far point to more humic DOM in shallow groundwaters, which is not expected to be a labile carbon source for microorganisms, but which may be involved in complexation or other biogeochemical reactions that mobilize arsenic.",

Unique nutrient and trace element cycling occurs within an OMZ. The extent and severity of OMZs is changing globally, making it critical to understand these fluctuations and their important implications for biogeochemical cycling in both the water column and sediments. The Eastern Tropical North Pacific OMZ impinges on basin slopes where laminated, hemipelagic sediments record useful proxies of OMZ fluctuations. In an OMZ, low O2 content promotes water column denitrification; this enriches the residual nitrate pool in 15N. This 15N-enriched nitrate assimilated by primary producers imparts its isotopic signature on Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON) exported from euphotic zone and buried in sediments. The intensity of anoxia is reflected in the degree of 15N enrichment in the sedimentary PON. We will present high-resolution δ15N records obtained from laminated sediment cores from the Pescadero Slope (Gulf of California) and the Santa Monica Basin (California Borderland) that show distinct temporal fluctuations in the δ15-PN with a decadal to multi-decadal frequency. The Pescadero gravity core has age control provided by 24 14C dates. Comparisons between δ15Nsed and percent biogenic silica in sediments help elucidate the factors driving the changes in the intensity of the OMZ. Preliminary data show enriched δ15Nsed values correspond to increased percentages of biogenic silica in sediments, indicating a connection between increased bSi productivity and the intensity of the OMZ in the ETNP.",

            "abstract": "A recently drilled groundwater investigation borehole, drilled to a depth of 1760 m in the Humu’ula Saddle of Hawaii Island, encountered an unexpectedly high temperature gradient of more than 160 ̊C/km. Although prior MT surveys across the region identified conductive formations of modest extent in the region, there were few surface manifestations of geologic structures likely to host a geothermal system and no evidence of an active, extensive hydrothermal system. Cores recovered from the borehole showed the presence of intrusive formations and moderate hydrothermal alteration at depth with progressive infilling of fractures and vesicles with depth and temperature. Independent modeling of gravity data (Flinders et al., 2013) suggests the presence of a broad intrusive complex within the region that is consistent with the borehole’s confirmation of a high-elevation (~1400 m amsl) regional water table. A subsequent MT survey covering much of the western Saddle region has confirmed the presence of highly conductive conditions, consistent with thermal activity, to depths of 4 km and greater. Light stable isotope data for the borehole fluids indicate that the regional water table is derived from recharge from the upper elevations of Mauna Kea; major element chemistry indicates that formation temperatures exceed 200 ̊C. A conceptual model of the hydrothermal system, along with isotopic and fluid chemistry of the thermal fluids will be presented.",

In this work, the full problem is investigated with direct numerical simulations. Our simulations employ a recently developed capability in our General Purpose Research Simulator (AD-GPRS). The compositional approach is based on K-values and a linear density model. A shared-memory parallel implementation allows for high resolution simulations in a reasonable time frame. Our \nresults indicate that it is important to consider the reduction in the dissolution rate after the fingers begin to interact with the bottom of the aquifer. Another important observation suggests considering a reduction in the dissolution rate where the plume thickness increases in time. In addition to the large-scale simulations, we performed convective-mixing simulations in relatively small domains to support the analysis of large-scale plume migration and CO2 trapping.",

Southeastern Alaska is home to the St. Elias Mountains, an active orogen being impacted by temperate marine glaciers. During glacial periods ice streams advance across the continental shelf, carving shelf-crossing troughs that reach the shelf edge. We use high-resolution multibeam data to develop the relationship between two troughs, the Yakutat and Alsek Sea Valleys, and associated continental slope morphology. The shelf and slope geomorphology can be divided into statistical groupings that relate to the relative balance of erosion and deposition. Our analysis indicates that only the Yakutat system has been able to build an incipient trough-mouth fan. The extreme sediment supply from this region was able to overwhelm the steep initial topography of the transform margin, while farther to the east sediment slope-bypass dominates. This analysis provides an extreme end member to existing studies of temperate glaciation along continental margins. The unique interplay between rapid uplift due to ongoing collision and the massive erosion caused by temperate glaciers in a coastal system with extremely high precipitation provides for sedimentary flux far greater than other systems and thus allows for formation of a trough mouth fan in spite of a tectonically generated steep slope.",

However, many of its methods and discoveries can seem abstract and complicated for students. Collaborations between scientists and educators/artists to create accurate yet engaging demonstrations and activities have been crucial to increasing understanding and stimulating interest in fascinating geological topics. One such collaboration, which came out of Expedition 345 to the Hess Deep Rift, resulted in an interactive lab to explore sampling rocks from the usually inacessible lower oceanic crust, offering an insight into the geological processes that form the structure of the Earth’s crust. This Hess Deep Interactive Lab aims to explain several significant discoveries made by oceanic drilling utilizing images of actual thin sections and core samples recovered from IODP expeditions. . Participants can interact with a physical model to learn about the coring and drilling processes, and gain an understanding of seafloor structures. The collaboration of this lab developed as a need to explain fundamental notions of the ocean crust formed at fast-spreading ridges. A complementary interactive online lab can be accessed at\nwww.joidesresolution.org\nfor students to engage further with these concepts.

            "abstract": "\"Rotations make nonsense of the two-dimensional reconstructions that are still so popular among structural geologists\". (McKenzie, 1990, p. 109-110)\nI present a comprehensive tectonic model for the strike-slip fault geometry, seismicity, material rotation, and stress rotation, in which new, optimally oriented faults can form when older ones have rotated about a vertical axis out of favorable orientations. The model was successfully tested in the Mojave region using stress rotation and three independent data sets: the alignment of epicenters and fault plane solutions from the six largest central Mojave earthquakes since 1947, material rotations inferred from paleomagnetic declination anomalies, and rotated dike strands of the Independence dike swarm. The model led not only to the anticipation of the 1992 M7.3 Landers, CA earthquake but also accounts for the great complexity of the faulting and seismicity of this event.\nThe implication of this model for crustal deformation in general is that rotations of material (faults and the blocks between them) and of stress provide the key link between the complexity of faults systems in-situ and idealized mechanical theory of faulting. Excluding rotations from the kinematical and mechanical analysis of crustal deformation makes it impossible to explain the complexity of what geologists see in faults, or what seismicity shows us about active faults. However, when we allow for rotation of material and stress, Coulomb's law becomes consistent with the complexity of faults and faulting observed in situ.",

            "abstract": "Very high temperature fumaroles unambiguously represent samples of magmatic gas expanding to the surface from sub-volcanic magma bodies. Here we present the results of thermochemical modelling of measured fumarole gas compositions that confirm that magmatic gases are SO2-dominant when redox is controlled by homogeneous gas reactions involving SO2, H2S and other species, i.e. the ‘gas buffer’. In subsurface volcanic environments, SO2 also dominates when oxygen fugacity, fO2, is greater than the value imposed by the Ni-NiO buffer; a common situation in arc environments. These results indicate that to understand the systematics of arc magma degassing, it is necessary to investigate how SO2, the principle sulfur gas, reacts directly with magmatic materials.\nThermochemical modelling of the interaction between SO2-bearing gas mixtures and common rock-forming minerals such as anorthite and calcite indicates that SO2 spontaneously disproportionates to form anhydrite and a reduced sulfur species. Experimental investigation of these reactions in a gas-mixing tube furnace at 600-800 °C, 1 bar, demonstrates extremely rapid anhydrite formation on the surface of crystalline anorthite through chemisorption.\nIn the presence of H2O, the reduced sulfur species is H2S, which may subsequently react with co-transported metals such as Fe and Cu in the magmatic gas to form metal sulfides. It is proposed that this mechanism provides a straightforward explanation for the massive amounts of coexisting sulfate and sulfide cogenerated at depths of 1 to 4 km inside volcanic systems and now exposed as porphyry copper deposits. Anhydrite dissolution may contribute to the fragility of volcanic structures.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind, magnetospheric ions and micrometeorites impact the surface of airless bodies in the solar system and deposit energy in the surface material. Excitation and momentum transfer processes lead to sputtering or desorption of molecules and atoms, thereby creating a dynamic exosphere about an otherwise airless body. Ion mass spectrometry of ejected materials provides a highly sensitive method for detecting sputter products and determining the surface composition [Johnson and Baragiola, 1991; Elphic et al., 1991]. Though most of the material is sputtered as neutral gas, UV photons can ionize ejected neutrals and a small fraction of the ejecta leaves the surface in an ionized state. However, ions are deflected by the variably-oriented solar wind magnetic field and thus relating their detection to a surface location can be problematic. Here we estimate the average ion density close to the surface of Phobos or Deimos to predict whether modern mass spectrometry instruments [Mahaffey et al. 2014] would be able to obtain sufficient compositional information to place constraints on their origin. The open source Monte Carlo program SRIM.SR was used to simulate the effect of ions incident onto a surface representing several different meteorite compositions and gave estimates of the damage and sputtering effects. As much of the empirical data supporting SRIM results comes from sputtering of metallic and organic molecular targets which can differ greatly from materials that make up planetary surfaces, measurements of cohesive energies and enthalpies of formation were used to estimate the surface binding energies for minerals, though these can vary significantly depending on the chemical composition. Since these properties affect the sputtering yield, comparisons of simulations with laboratory measurements were made to test the validity of our estimates. Using the validated results and a constant fraction to estimate ion yields, the density of ejected ions and neutrals vs. altitude from Phobos and Deimos was calculated using analytical equations. We use the results to make predictions on the expected signal for several meteorite classes.",

Accurately forecasting budburst response to these changes demands an understanding of the drivers of budburst. Current research and predictive models focus on population or landscape-level drivers, yet fundamental questions regarding drivers of budburst diversity within an individual tree remain unanswered. We hypothesize that foliar temperature, an important physiological property, may be a dominant driver of differences in the timing of budburst within a single tree. Studying these differences facilitates development of high throughput phenotyping technology used to improve predictive budburst models. We present spatial and temporal variation in foliar temperature as a function of physical drivers culminating in a single-tree budburst model based on foliar temperature.\nWe use a novel remote sensing approach, combined with on-site meteorological measurements, to demonstrate important intra-canopy differences between air and foliar temperature. We mounted a thermal infrared camera within an old-growth canopy at the H.J. Andrews LTER forest and imaged an 8m by 10.6m section of a Douglas-fir crown. Sampling one image per minute, approximately 30,000 thermal infrared images were collected over a one-month period to approximate foliar temperature before, during and after budburst. Using time-lapse photography in the visible spectrum, we documented budburst at fifteen-minute intervals with eight cameras stratified across the thermal infrared camera’s field of view. Within the imaged tree’s crown, we installed a pyranometer, 2D sonic anemometer and fan-aspirated thermohygrometer and collected 3,000 measurements of net shortwave radiation, wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. We documented a difference of several days in the timing of budburst across both vertical and horizontal gradients. We also observed clear spatial and temporal foliar temperature gradients. In addition to exploring physical drivers of budburst, this remote sensing approach provides insight into intra-canopy structural complexity and opportunities to advance our understanding of vegetation-­atmospheric interactions.",

Under changing climate a large portion of soil C could potentially transfer back to the atmosphere as CO₂, pushing the earth system into a positive feedback loop between increasing soil CO₂ emissions and rising temperatures. We rely on models to estimate soil responses to climate change; however recent global carbon cycle model intercomparisons have shown poor model performance in capturing C cycle processes in the soil. To gain more confidence in the range of potential soil C emissions over a long-term period of climate change it is necessary to match the model outputs with the observations. Studies have shown that data-model fusion techniques can improve conventional models’ spatial representation of observed soil carbon, and that adding an explicit microbial component further improves model performance. The soil carbon datasets used to inform conventional models often do not contribute much information to model parameters associated with processes happening on a short time scale, such as turnover rates of fast organic matter, rates of enzyme production and loss, activation energy of microbial uptake of dissolved organic carbon, etc. In this study we (1) inform conventional and microbial soil models with observed time series of soil respiration and estimate the optimum parameter sets for various plant functional types, (2) explore the drivers of variability in the optimum parameters across plant functional types, and (3) investigate whether including explicit microbial dynamics improves model performance compared to that of a conventional model.",

            "abstract": "Sudden enhancement of the plasma pressure in the near-Earth plasma sheet is one of the common manifestations of the substorms, and is thought to play an important role in relevant disturbances in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. On 1 March 2008 four of the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) probes observed the sudden enhancement of the plasma pressure around 15:40 UT. The four probes were almost aligned along the Sun-Earth line, which was suitable for investigating spatial-temporal evolution of the near-Earth plasma sheet around the substorm onset. The four probes were located off the equatorial plane, according to a magnetic field model. The plasma pressure suddenly increased at the inner most probe first (at ~7.2 Re), followed by the outer probes (at ~7.5, ~8.3, and ~10.4 Re), that could be seen as a tailward propagation (or retreat) of high-pressure region (HPR). After comparing with results of a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation, we found that only the tailward propagation of the HPR could be seen at off-equator. Near the equatorial plane, the HPR propagates earthward from the magnetotail region, then it retreats tailward. In the course of the tailward propagation, the HPR also propagates away from the equatorial plane. As a consequence, the inner most probe observed the pressure enhancement first, followed by the outer probes. The propagation of the HPR in the ZGSM direction is understood to be a combination of the convergence of the plasma flow (the divergence of bulk velocity along the ZGSM axis), and the pressure gradient force.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of Fe3+ between silicate melts and minerals is a key parameter to understand magmatic processes, as it is directly linked to oxygen fugacity (fO2). fO2 is, a priori, not a constant during magmatic processes, and its evolution depends on the compatibility of Fe3+. We have experimentally determined the partition coefficients of Fe3+ between augite, pigeonite, and silicate melt, and use them to constrain the fO2of the martian mantle and of differentiated martian basalts.\nA series of experiments on various martian basaltic compositions were performed under controlled fO2 in one-atmosphere gas-mixing furnaces. Fe3+/Fetotal ratios in silicate melts and pyroxenes were determined using synchrotron Fe K-edge XANES on the 13 IDE beamline at APS (Argonne). Fe3+ mineral/melt partition coefficients (DFe3+) for augite and pigeonite were obtained with a relative uncertainty of 10-15 %. Both are constant over a wide range of oxygen fugacity (FMQ-2.5 to FMQ+2.0). DFe3+ for augite and pigeonite are broadly consistent with previous data by [1], but DFe3+ for augite is significantly higher (by a factor of 2) than the indirect determinations of [2]. Since augites in [2] are extremely poor in iron compared to ours (0.18 wt% vs 13 wt% FeO), this strongly suggests that DFe3+ varies with Mg#, indicating that Fe3+is more compatible than previously thought in terrestrial mantle pyroxenes (3 wt% FeO) as well.\nCrystallization paths for shergottite parental melts have been calculated using the MELTS software, combined with our partition coefficients. fO2 in the residual melts is calculated from the models of [3] and [4]. It stays relatively constant at high temperatures, but increases very strongly during the latest stages of crystallization. These results explain the large range of fO2 determined in enriched shergottites. In order to estimate the fO2 of the martian mantle, only the highest temperature phases in the most primitive martian samples should be used. The most primitive shergottites record a mantle fO2 around FMQ-2.5, consistent with the lowest fO2estimated for surface basalts [5].\n[1] McCanta et al.

            "abstract": "We report the preliminary design of a fast vertical profiling autonomous underwater vehicle, called Clio, designed to cost-effectively improve the understanding of marine microorganism ecosystem dynamics on a global scale.\nThe insights into biogeochemical cycles to be gained from illuminating the relationships between ocean life and chemistry have led to establishment of the GEOTRACES program. The nutrient and trace element profiles generated by GEOTRACES will provide insight into what is happening biogeochemically, but not how it is happening, i.e., what biochemical pathways are active? Advances in sequencing technology and in situ preservation have made it possible to study the genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins and enzymes), metabolomics (lipids and other metabolites), and metallomics (metals), associated with marine microorganisms; however, these techniques require sample collection. To this end, Clio will carry two to four SUspended Particle Rosette (SUPR) multi-samplers to depths of 6000 m. Clio is being designed specifically to complement the GEOTRACES program—to operate simultaneously and independently of the wire-based sampling protocols developed for GEOTRACES. At each GEOTRACES ocean transect sampling station, Clio will be deployed from the ship, transit vertically to the seafloor, and then ascend to, and stop at up to 32 sampling depths, where it will filter up to 150 l of seawater per sample. Filtered samples for RNA will be administered a dose of preservative (RNALater) in situ.\nClio must efficiently hold station at multiple depths between the surface and 6000 m, but also move rapidly between sampling depths. It must be chemically clean and avoid disturbing the water column while sampling. Clio must be operationally friendly, requiring few personnel to operate, and have minimal impact on shipboard operations. We have selected a positively-buoyant thruster-driven design with a quasi-isopycnal construction. Our simulations indicate the vehicle can complete dives that mirror their GEOTRACES counterparts within the station time alloted. The simulation includes the effects of material/housing compressibility and thermal expansion, and employs a global average T/S profile from the Levitus 1982 climatology.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a powerful landscape scale disturbance agent in tundra ecosystems. Impacts on biophysical properties (e.g. albedo) and biogeochemical function (e.g. carbon flux) underscore the need to better quantify fire-climate linkages in tundra ecosystems as climate change accelerates at northern high latitudes. In this context, a critical question is “How does the functional linkage between climate and fire vary across spatial domains dominated by different vegetation types?”\nWe address this question with BLM-Alaska Fire Service area burned data (http://fire.ak.blm.gov/predsvcs/maps.php) used in conjunction with downscaled historical climate data from the Scenarios Network for Alaska Planning (http://www.snap.uaf.edu/data.php) to develop gradient boosting models of annual area burned in Alaska tundra ecosystems. The sparse historical fire records in the Arctic necessitate explicit quantification of model uncertainty associated with the development of statistical analyses. In this work, model uncertainty is depicted through the construction of separate models depicting fire-climate relationships for regions defined by the graminoid, shrub, and wetland tundra vegetation classes (Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map: http://www.geobotany.uaf.edu/cavm/). Non-linear relationships between annual area burned and climate variables are depicted with partial dependence functions.\nOur results show that vegetation-specific models result in different non-linear relationships between climate and fire. Precipitation variables generally had higher relative influence scores than temperature; however, differences between the magnitude of the scores were greater when models were built with monthly (versus seasonal) explanatory variables. Key threshold values for climate variables are identified. The impact of model uncertainty on forecasts of future fire activity was quantified using output from five different AR5/CMIP5 General Circulation Models. Model uncertainty corresponding to vegetation-specific functional linkages between climate and fire has a magnitude similar to that of GCM-based model uncertainty. Results of this work strongly suggest that future forecasts of fire activity must account for and quantify sources of uncertainty in order to provide useful information.",

            "abstract": "The Plio-Pleistocene period is marked by numerous changes in Earth’s climate and tectonics. The early Pliocene average global surface temperature of ~3° C was warmer than today and the sea level was high around 10-20 m, whereas the continents adjudicated its present day position. In this study we discussed about Indian monsoon variability during the Plio-Pleistocene. Numerous investigations were carried out over the last two decades to understand Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability and its relation to Himalayan tectonics. The ISM is a principal factor to the economy of the south Asian countries playing immense role in changing fauna and flora on land as well as socio-economic conditions of this region. The Arabian Sea is a natural laboratory to carry out paleoclimatic studies on marine sediments. In this study four Ocean Drilling Programme sediment cores were used from the northwestern Arabian Sea, Leg 117, Holes 722B, 731A (Owen Ridge) and 728B, 730A (Oman margin). The planktonic foraminiferal species abundances, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) wt.% and carbonate concentration (CaCO3) proxies were utilised to understand Plio-Pleistocene Indian monsoon variability. The relative abundances of Globigerina bulloides, Globigerinita glutinata and mixed layer species reveal changes in upwelling and mixed layer since the Pliocene. Our results demonstrate that intense upwelling occurred during 5 to ~3.7 Ma, 1.5Ma to Recent and an abrupt change was recorded around 0.1 Ma at all the Holes. The weakening of upwelling occurred from 3.5 Ma to ~1.5 Ma, hence we argue that this is due to Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Mixed layer species show higher abundances from 2 Ma to 0.8 Ma. The TOC wt.% varies from 7.8% to 0.5% and productive increased many fold during 4 to 2 Ma. The results of TOC and CaCO3 are inversely correlated indicating role of carbonate dissolution.",

In these reservoir rocks, permeability is dominated by faults and fractures, with small contributions made by primary permeability. As such the study of how these structures are generated, their properties (e.g. orientation, spatial distribution, aperture, orientation with respect to the stress field), and how they become filled with precipitated minerals is vital to understanding the evolution of these geothermal systems, and is key to their successful development. In particular, fracture sealing is known to decrease the overall permeability of, or create permeability barriers in a geothermal reservoir, limiting its effectiveness as a resource. As such study of this sealing process is vital to discerning the evolution of fractured geothermal systems.\nWe use electron backscatter diffraction combined with cathodoluminescence and energy dispersive X-ray data from calcite and quartz filled veins from high temperature geothermal fields in New Zealand to investigate chemical patterns and microstructures in sealed reservoir fractures. Results indicate that while chemical zonation patterns may appear diverse or complicated, accompanying physical mineral growth and microstructure can either be simple or tell a more convoluted story. Calcite veins explored show little to no deformation and chemical suggesting postkinematic vein growth into free space with no subsequent deformation, while chemical zonation suggests fluid chemistry variation as sealing progressed. Quartz filled veins show crystal orientation of depositing vein crystals is controlled by that of the fracture wall minerals, and that varying chemistry has little to no impact on quartz microstructure.",

            "abstract": "As a wet planet becomes hot, evaporation of the ocean provides a thick steam atmosphere. As the atmosphere thickens, the level at which optical depth is unity (whence radiative emission and absorption dominantly occur) rises into the atmosphere, first for thermal wavelengths and later for solar wavelengths. Consequently, two radiation limits emerge. First, an asymptotic limit on the thermal radiation, as the level at which thermal emission occurs tends towards a fixed temperature, decoupled from surface temperature. Next, a limit the albedo of the planet, as all incoming sunlight is either reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere and almost none reaches the surface. A runaway greenhouse occurs when the product of co-albedo and area-averaged incoming sunlight exceeds the thermal radiation limit. Earth today is perilously close to this [1].\nReturning to the first sentence, we generate a thick atmosphere: the height of optical depth of unity becomes a non-trivial fraction of the planetary radius. Hence the area of the absorbing and emitting surfaces increase. Thermal emission wins slightly, as this occurs higher, increasing thermal emission in all cases. The underlying tendency is for a larger thermal limit for heavier planets due to pressure effects, making these appear more resistant to a runaway. However, atmospheric expansion affects light planets more, making these seem much more resilient. The least resilient planet would be between Mars-size and Venus-size (Figure 1).\nIt would be foolish to regard small planets as habitable. As the atmospheres become large, so does the problem of atmospheric escape. Theoretical considerations show hydrodynamic escape to happen disastrously for a Europa-size planet. The observation is that Mars is too feeble to hold on to any hefty atmosphere, even far from the Sun as it is, is probably relevant too. The take home points for habitable zone nerds are: (1) planet size matters (2) for small planets, atmospheric escape from a \"moist greenhouse\" state, with habitable surface temperatures, is the mortal wound.\n[1] Goldblatt, C., Robinson, T.D., Zahnle, K.J. & Crisp, D., Low simulated radiation limit for runaway greenhouse climates, Nat.

To understand the implications for the small-scale structure and evolution of Europa, we mosaicked these frames (observations 12ESMOTTLE01 and 02, incidence ≈18°, emission ≈77°) into their regional context (part of observation 11ESREGMAP01, 220 m/pixel, incidence ≈74°, emission ≈23°), despite their very different viewing and lighting conditions. We created a map of geological units based on morphology, structure, and albedo along with stereoscopic images where the frames overlapped. The highly diverse units range from: high albedo sub-parallel ridge and grooved terrain; to variegated-albedo hummocky terrain; to low albedo and relatively smooth terrain. We classified and analyzed the diverse units solely based on the high-resolution image mosaic, prior to comparison to the context image, to obtain an in-depth look at possible surface evolution and underlying formational processes. We infer that some of these units represent different stages and forms of resurfacing, including cryovolcanic and tectonic resurfacing. However, significant morphological variation among units in the region indicates that there are different degrees of resurfacing at work. We have created candidate morphological sequences that provide insight into the conversion of ridged plains to chaotic terrain—generally, a process of subduing formerly sharp features through tectonic modification and/or cryovolcanism. When the map of the high-resolution area is compared to the regional context, features that appear to be one unit at regional resolution are comprised of several distinct units at high resolution, and features that appear to be smooth in the context image are found to show distinct textures. Moreover, in the context image, transitions from ridged units to disrupted units appear to be gradual; however the high-resolution image reveals them to be abrupt, suggesting tectonic control of these boundaries. These discrepancies could have important implications for a future landed exploration.",

            "abstract": "Southeast Asia has been experiencing major haze events over the past decades. Even though they are due to large-scale biomass burning, recent studies have shown that these events are becoming worse, in terms of both frequency and impact on air pollution. Some of the heaviest events, which used to be associated only with strong El-Nino events (and other phenomenons leading to large-scale tropical drying) are now becoming more frequent over the continent (2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2014).\nDirect emissions from these fires (black carbon and organic carbon aerosols) and indirect pollutants (ozone) play a major role in both the derivation of human health, changes to radiative forcing, and cloud properties. Furthermore, given the meteorology and active convection in the tropics, such pollutants tend to spread widely, entering into the global-scale circulation patterns. Finally, local sources of pollution may contribute to increase the toxicity of the event.\nThe critical component regarding this burning is the rapid conversion of forests, agricultural lands, and associated waste products to other types or uses. As there is a long time record of land surface properties (reflectance, albedo, LAI and NDVI), any observed changes in the fires must be associated with observed changes in the large-scale properties of the land itself.\nTo this end, we use a principal component approach to determine the regions of the continent which are the most variable from 2001 through 2013. We then derive the relationships between these spatial and temporal regions of variability, the AOD (aerosol optical depth), the large-scale reanalysis meteorology, the remotely sensed precipitation, and solar radiation.\nThese different factors are further analyzed in a regime by regime basis. Some of the regimes are expected to be variable but statistically climatological, while the influence of others should be changing. This study is a precursor step to future modeling efforts for deriving bi-directional climate change influences.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater saturated sediments and soils represent vital ecosystems due to their nutrient cycling capacities and their prominent contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the diversity of microorganisms and metabolic pathways involved in carbon cycling, and the impacts of these processes on other biogeochemical cycles remain poorly understood. Major advances in DNA sequencing have helped forge linkages between the previously disconnected biological and chemical components of these systems. Here, we present data on the use of assembly-based metagenomics to generate hypotheses on microbial carbon degradation and biogeochemical cycling in waterlogged sediments and soils. DNA sequencing from a fresh water aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River in Rifle, CO yielded extensive genome recovery from multiple previously unknown bacterial lineages. Fermentative metabolisms encoded by these genomes drive nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur cycling in this subsurface system. We are also applying a similar approach to identify microbial processes in a freshwater wetland on Lake Erie, OH. Given the increased diversity (increased richness, decreased evenness, and strain variation) of wetland sediment microbial communities, we modified methods for specialized assembly of long taxonomic marker gene amplicons (EMIRGE) to create a biogeographical map of Fungi, Archaea, and Bacteria along depth and hydrological transects. This map reveals that the microbial community associated with the top two depths (>7 cm) is significantly different from bottom depths (7-40 cm). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) molecular weight and the presence of oxidized terminal electron acceptors best predict differences in microbial community structure. Laboratory mesocosms amended with pore-water DOM, in situ soil communities, and variable oxygen conditions link DOM composition and redox to microbial metabolic networks, biogeochemical cycles, and green house gas emission. Organism identities from laboratory studies are linked to field biogeography patterns to inform a physiology-based understanding of wetland biogeochemical processes. This research sheds light on microbial organisms and interdependent metabolic processes impacting cycling of organic matter in freshwater sediments and soils.",

            "abstract": "Passive microwave radiometry is a special application of microwave communications technology for the purpose of collecting Earth’s electromagnetic radiation. With the use of radiometers onboard earth orbiting satellites, scientists are able to monitor the Earth’s environment and climate system on both short- and long-term temporal scales with near global coverage.\nThe Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) is part of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) broader commitment toward global and long-term observation of the Earth’s environment. GCOM consists of two polar orbiting satellite series, GCOM-W (Water) and GCOM-C (Climate), with 1-year overlap between them for inter-calibration.\nAMSR2 onboard GCOM-W1 is a microwave radiometer system that measures dual polarized radiances at 6.9, 7.3, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. It is a sun-synchronous orbiter that acquires microwave radiances by conically scanning the Earth’s surface at a nominal earth incidence angle of 55 degrees that results in a wide swath of 1450 km.\nAs a part of Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) GCOM-W1 product development and validation project will provide NOAA’s users access to critical geophysical products derived from AMSR-2. These products, which are detailed in NOAA’s JPSS Level 1 Requirements Document Supplement, include: microwave brightness temperature, total precipitable water, cloud liquid water, precipitation type/rate, sea surface temperature, and Sea Surface Wind Speed.\nPhase-1 of the AMSR-2 project at NOAA included inter-calibration of AMSR-2 measured brightness temperatures with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager as the reference radiometer. The second phase of the project utilized the calibrated brightness temperatures in a robust Bayesian network to retrieve more accurate geophysical parameters over the ocean surface. It can handle retrievals even with missing channels and can be implemented in operational environment. One year worth of data (2013) was used to create profiles of AMSR-2 brightness temperatures and the corresponding geophysical parameters. The retrieved parameters were then validated with other models and satellite products to make sure they meet the requirements.",

            "abstract": "Charcoal plays a significant role in the long-term carbon cycle and its use as a soil amendment is becoming a viable carbon sequestration strategy (biochar). One challenge in this research area has been comparing results between studies in part due to the diversity of lab and field production conditions. Although the highest treatment temperature (HTT) is often used to describe pyrolysis conditions, several studies have shown that length of time at the highest temperature can also cause changes to the physicochemical qualities of charcoal and ignoring this effect may introduce inter-comparison problems. Addressing this issue becomes especially important in the discussion of optimizing biochar for soil remediation and carbon sequestration, and in discussions of charcoal use in reconstructing past fire regimes, as increasing time at temperature may cause changes in charcoal properties similar to the changes caused by increasing HTT. Here we introduce a formal definition of charring intensity (CI) to more accurately characterize pyrolysis, and we document variation in this property with pyrolysis temperature and reaction duration. We found two types of responses to CI: either a linear or a threshold relationship. We show that a threshold exists where %C, %N and δ15N begin exhibiting large changes, and this CI threshold co-occurred with an increase in charcoal aromaticity. Mass yield decreased linearly with charring intensity and carbon isotopes did not change from original biomass values in our controlled laboratory experiments. Analysis of these data shows that pyrolysis parameters should be defined in the literature as a combination of temperature and duration conditions, and that biomass that has undergone pyrolysis may be influencing soil organic nitrogen. Additionally, the lack of alteration in carbon isotopes across our matrix supports the efficacy of using pyrolyzed material for archaeological reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Much of our understanding of the climatic controls on tree species distributions is based on contemporary observational datasets. For example, forest inventory analysis (FIA) and other spatial datasets are used to build correlative models of climate suitability for plant taxa for use in environmental niche models. More complex dynamic models rely on species interactions, physiological processes, and competition, among other processes, that are also parameterized against contemporary data. However, as much as a quarter of the forested region in the upper Midwestern United States may be considered novel relative to pre-settlement baselines (Goring et al. submitted). Hence, modern surveys or even long-term datasets may represent only a portion of the ecological or climate space taxa might occupy. Using gridded datasets of pre-settlement vegetation for the northeastern United States from Town Propritor Suveys and the Public Land Survey, we examine the effects of European land-use conversion – logging, agricultural conversion and re-establishment – on climate-vegetation relationships.\nWe show that in regions where land-use change is climatically biased, such as conversion to agriculture along the prairie-forest boundary, impacts on the realized climatic niches for various tree taxa can be significant. Improving predicted distributions of taxa is critical for planning and mitigating the effects of widespread shifts in forest composition resulting from climate change. Using pre-settlement data can improve our understanding of the potential niches occupied by major forest taxa, improving the predictive abilities of environmental niche and mechanistic models.",

            "abstract": "Offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas can be significantly and adversely affected by sea ice. In the event of an oil spill, sea ice complicates the tracking of ice/oil trajectories and can hinder cleanup operations. There is a need for a sea ice dynamics model that can accurately simulate ice pack deformation and failure to improve the ability to track ice/oil trajectories and support oil response operations.\nA discrete element method (DEM) model, where each ice floe is represented by discrete elements that are initially bonded (frozen) together will be used to address the difficulty continuum modeling approaches have with representing discrete phenomena in sea ice, such as the formation of leads and ridges. Each discrete element in the DEM is a rigid body driven by environmental forcing (wind, current and Coriolis forces) and interaction forces with other discrete elements (compression, shear, tension, bond rupture and regrowth).\nWe introduce a new DEM model ``Siku'', currently under development, to simulate ice drift of an ice floe on a spherical Earth. We will present initial free-drift results. Siku is focused on improving sea ice interaction mechanics and providing an accurate geometrical representation needed for basin scale and regional simulations. Upon completion, Siku will be an open source GNU GPL licensed user friendly program with embedded python capability for setting up simulations “scenarios” and coupling with other models to provide forcing fields. We use a unique quaternion representation for position and orientation of polygon sea-ice elements that use a second order integration scheme of sea-ice element motion on the Earth’s sphere that does not depend on the location of the element and, hence, avoids numerical problems near the pole.",

            "abstract": "The National Research Council Framework for K-12 Science Literacy reports that children reared in rural agricultural communities, who experience regular interactions with plants and animals, develop more sophisticated understanding of ecology and biological systems than do urban and suburban children of the same age. West Virginia (WV) is a rural state. The majority of its residents live in communities of fewer than 2,500 people. Based on the features of the population being served and their unique strengths, this presentation focuses on a regional model for teacher professional development that addresses agricultural and energy vulnerabilities and adaptations to climate change in WV.\nThe professional development model outlined shows how to guide teachers to use a problem-based learning approach to introduce climate data and analysis techniques within a scenario context that is locally meaningful. This strategy engages student interest by focusing on regional and community concerns. Climate science standards are emphasized in the Next Generation Science Standards, but WV has not provided its teachers with appropriate instructional resources to meet those standards. The authors addressed this need by offering a series of climate science education workshops followed by online webinars offered to WV science educators free of charge with funding by the West Virginia Space Grant Consortium. The authors report on findings from this series of professional development workshops conducted in partnership with the West Virginia Science Teachers Association. The goal was to enhance grades 5-12 teaching and learning about climate change through problem-based learning.\nPrior to offering the climate workshops, all WV science educators were asked to complete a short questionnaire. As Figure 1 shows, over 40% of the teacher respondents reported being confident in teaching climate science content. For comparison post workshops surveys measure teacher confidence in climate science instruction after the professional development sessions. In summary, this report describes how this professional approach can serve as a regional model to address the need for climate science literacy throughout Appalachia.",

            "abstract": "South Africa is host to the largest single known platinum group metal supply in the world. The Bushveld Igneous Complex, spanning 300x400 kilometers, hosts hundreds of years’ worth of platinum, chromite, vanadium, and other ore. Its wealth of these metals is tied directly to the large layered igneous intrusion that formed roughly 2061 million years ago. The extraction of platinum is vital to the industrial world – as these metals are widely used in the automotive industry, dental restorations, computer technology, in addition to many other applications. In collaboration with the Africa Array geophysics field school and the Penn State Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP), we surveyed the Modikwa mine located along the border of the provinces of Mpumalanga and Limpopo in South Africa. The following techniques were applied to survey the area of interest: seismic refraction and reflection, gravity, magnetics, electrical resistivity, and electromagnetics. The data collected were used to determine the depth to bedrock and to identify potential mining hazards from dykes and faults in the bedrock. Several areas were studied and with the combination of the above-mentioned methods several possible hazards were identified. One broad, major dyke that was located in a prior aeromagnetic survey and several previously undetected, parallel, minor dykes were identified in the region. The overburden thickness was determined to be ̴4-5 meters in some regions, and as thin as several centimeters in others. This section of rock and soil lies above an area where platinum will likely be mined in the future. The removal of overburden can be accomplished by using power shovels or scrapers; while remaining material can be contained with the use of galvanized steel culverts. Additionally, a number of joints were located that may have allowed water to accumulate underground. The models created from the data permit us to estimate which hazards could be present in different parts of the land surveyed. These results are important information that will help determine how deep to mine while also avoiding hazards that could result in serious injuries to personnel or cause costly damages to equipment.",

Grazing is the main kind of human activities on the alpine grassland. To investigate the relationship of the grazing activities and grassland degradation will help the understanding of the effects of human impacts. A GPS tracing experiment was designed to tracing the activities of the Yaks. The spatial distribution of the grazing pressure was simulated under Geographic Information System. The biomass distribution and grazing pressure was compared to judge the distribution of overgrazing. The main research results are: (1) The tracing experiment could record the track of the Yaks very well, and it could be a good tool for the quantification research of grazing pressure. (2) The grazing activities have good relationship with vegetation, residents and landform. The worse vegetation is, the grazing time is longer and the radius is bigger. The closer to the residents, the grazing intensive is higher. The grazing route is influenced by the landform. Usually the herds would like to choose the least cost way. And the grazing intensive is higher in sunny slope. (3) The grazing probability is higher while the elevation is lower and the vegetation is better. The numbers of livestock of different villages determine the spatial distribution of the grazing pressure but it has very big\nheterogeneity\nin the same village. It seems the forage is enough in the research area since the available biomass is about 1190058t and the total demand is only 603700t. But because of the heterogeneity of the grazing pressure, there are still overgrazing in some villages. The area of overgrazing is 6 percent in the winter rangeland and 11 percent in summer rangeland.\nIt is important to take care of the spatial heterogeneity of the grazing pressure and grass production in the management of the grassland ecosystem. It should improve the calculation method of the stock capacity to avoid the overrating of it. To arrange the livestock reasonably is the guarantee of the sustainable development in this region.",

            "abstract": "Blue water withdrawals in the United States since 1950 show a remarkable pattern. After doubling between 1950 and 1980, water use slightly declined in spite of a doubling in GDP, 30 percent population growth and a 70 percent increase in per capita GDP since 1980. We relate this remarkable pattern to the changing long-term structural changes of the U.S. economy as it became a service economy, experiencing a decrease in relative share of manufacturing and a secular decline in agriculture. Drawing on Leontief (1970)’s seminal analysis, we decompose the U.S. water use in terms of scale, composition and technology. We find that about 1/3 of water saving can be attributed to shifting final demand by domestic and foreign buyers for U.S. products; slightly more than a 1/3 relates to the changing input output structure that characterizes U.S. production, and less than 1/3 is to be attributed to water productivity gains related to improvements in technology. In addition, our estimates indicate that the vast majority of the water productivity gains due to technological improvements stem from gains in water/KWh in electricity generation. Finally, while globalization and the growing water content of net imports increased for the U.S. since 1950, they by no means overturn the increased water saving due to changing sectoral composition of the U.S. economy.",

Ice plant invasion is facilitated by the plant's ability to compete for water. More frequent drought due to climate change could enhance the invasive potential of ice plant due to its succulent properties and potential to access and compete for water under drought conditions. However, ice plant spread may be slowed due to water stress under drought despite a potential competitive advantage. We test the alternative hypotheses that invasive potential increases or decreases during times of drought by analyzing ice plant spread during past droughts at Bodega Bay, California using analysis of aerial photographs taken over the last two decades. The results of this analysis may reveal how ice plant may behave in future drought years and provide useful information for invasive species management.",

The emissions of gaseous pollutants (CO, NOx, NH3, VOCs, and SO2) and particulate matter (BC, OC, PM2.5, and PM10) are taken from the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS) version 2. Dust and sea salt emissions are simulated online, where dust parameters are optimized using observed particular matter (PM10) concentrations in 73 cities in China. We add gravitational settlement for dust and sea salt in vertical levels. The preliminary results show that the model predicts PM10 reasonably well compared to the ground measurement data. The bias in modeled PM10 concentrations in South and Northwest­­­­­­­ China is less than 10%.

            "abstract": "We introduce and discuss an open-source, user friendly, numerical post-processing piece of software to assess reliability of the modeling results of environmental fluid mechanics' codes. Verification and Validation, Uncertainty Quantification (VAVUQ) is a toolkit developed in Matlab© for general V&V proposes. In this work, The VAVUQ implementation of V&V techniques and user interfaces would be discussed. VAVUQ is able to read Excel, Matlab, ASCII, and binary files and it produces a log of the results in txt format. Next, each capability of the code is discussed through an example: The first example is the code verification of a sediment transport code, developed with the Finite Volume Method, with MES. Second example is a solution verification of a code for groundwater flow, developed with the Boundary Element Method, via MES. Third example is a solution verification of a mixed order, Compact Difference Method code of heat transfer via MMS. Fourth example is a solution verification of a 2-D, Finite Difference Method code of floodplain analysis via Complete Richardson Extrapolation. In turn, application of VAVUQ in quantitative model skill assessment studies (validation) of environmental codes is given through two examples: validation of a two-phase flow computational modeling of air entrainment in a free surface flow versus lab measurements and heat transfer modeling in the earth surface versus field measurement. At the end, we discuss practical considerations and common pitfalls in interpretation of V&V results.",

The simulation is initialized from the North American Regional Reanalysis data set on the scale of the North American continent. The observed Goshen County tornadic supercell evolves in the simulation from the regional slope flow embedded an a favorable synoptic environment. A supercell and tornado were produced by the simulation in the approximate location and precise time that observations were made of the event by the Vortex 2 team. This was withoiut additional assimilation of high resolution observations beyond the standard data contributing to the 1500 UTC 35 km NARR analysis 7 hours prior to the observed tornado. The simulation can be and is compared directly to Vortex 2 Doppler observations. The process of orogenic storm organization driven by the interaction of topography and the large scale environment is discussed. It is hypothesized that the unusually high predictability of the timing and location as well as the system structure and attendant weather including tornado activity was the result of a highly predictable diurnal slope flow environment that constrained and so reduced the uncertainty of the simulation outcome.",

            "abstract": "Although water vapor disturbance has been long term recognized as the major error source in differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (d-InSAR) techniques for the ground deformation monitoring and topography reconstruction, it provides opportunities to extract the atmospheric water-vapor information from satellite SAR imageries that can be further used to support studies on earth energy budget, climate, the hydrological cycle, and meteorological forecasting, etc. The water vapor contribution in interferometric phases is normally referred as the atmospheric delay dominated by water vapor rather than condensed water (e.g. cloud). D-InSAR can produce maps of the column water vapor amounts (equivalent to integrated water vapor (IWV) or Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in other literatures) that are important parameters quantitatively describe the total amount of water vapor overlying a point on the earth surface. Similar products have been operationally produced in multi-spectrum remote sensing, e.g. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with a spatial resolution in 500 m to 1km; Whereas, the PWV products derived by d-InSAR have remarkably high spatial resolution that can capture fine scale of water vapor variations in space as small as tens of meters or even less.\nIn recent years, some efforts have been made to derive the water vapor products from interferogram and analyze the corresponding products quality, such as studies comparing integrated water vapor derived from interferometric phases to other measurements (e.g. MERIS, MODIS, GNSS), studies on deriving absolute water vapor products from d-InSAR, and studies on integrating d-InSAR water vapor products in meteorological numerical forecast.\nIn this study, considering these limitation factors and based on previous studies, we discuss the accuracy and statistics of the water vapor products from satellite SAR, including (1) Accuracy of the differential water vapor products; (2) Sources of calibration data set and their corresponding accuracy; and (3) Accuracy of the derived absolute water vapor products. Overall, we work on the strategy definition that bring the d-InSAR-derived water vapor products to be practically generated association with their accuracy information and available to wide research communities.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic upper mantle beneath the northwestern Pacific has large-scale lateral heterogeneity that is impossible to attribute to just an age-dependency of the thermal structure based on a cooling of homogeneous mantle with age. This surprising fact was revealed from seafloor magnetotelluric (MT) data collected in three areas, northwest (Area A) and southeast (Area B) of the Shatsky Rise, and off the Bonin Trench (Area C), through the Normal Oceanic Mantle Project and the Stagnant Slab Project. One-dimensional structures of electrical conductivity representing each area show significant difference in the thickness of the upper resistive layer that may be interpreted as cool lithosphere. The thickness of the layer that is more resistive than 0.01 S m-1 is ~80 km for Area A, ~110 km for Area B, and ~180 km for Area C. The conductivity below the resistive layer is similar to ~0.03 S m-1 for Areas A and C but a slightly higher than it for Area B. The thermal structures for the lithospheric age representing the areas (130, 140, and 147 Ma for Areas A, B, and C, respectively) predicted from a simple plate cooling model are almost identical and thus cannot reproduce such variations in electrical conductivity. Then, in this study, thermal and compositional states of the mantle beneath the three areas were investigated to discuss the cause of the variations. Combination of five model parameters, electrical conductivity of crust, mantle potential temperature, thickness of thermally conductive plate, and H2O and CO2 contents in the asthenospheric mantle were searched by forward modeling and the χ2 misfit between the MT responses observed and predicted were assessed with 95% acceptable level. The possibility of partial melting was taken into account by comparing to the solidus of peridotite that is reduced by H2O and CO2. We assumed that the mantle conductivity may be represented by the mixture of hydrous olivine and hydrous carbonated melt. The results suggest a possible influence of a mantle up-welling associated with the formation of the Shatsky Rise to the mantle beneath Areas A and B although these areas are away from the bathymetric anomaly.",

The NCAR Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA) measured VOCs on board the NSF GV aircraft during both of these experiments. Complementary VOC measurements were made by the UM AWAS on board the GV during CONTRAST. The relatively rapid TOGA measurements (30 second data every 2 minutes) coupled with the very high sensitivity of the instrument allows for tracking signatures of pollution in an otherwise near pristine environment (CONTRAST, TORERO) and for mapping out gradients in the VOC distributions in the northern and southern hemispheres. Because of the wide range of solubilities and reactivities the suite of measured VOCs encompasses, these species provide critical information on the transport and chemical and/or physical processing during and following convective events (CONTRAST). In this study, we use the CAM-Chem 3D chemistry climate model driven with MERRA meteorological fields to provide context to our observational data. The model has a detailed representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. Its scope has recently been extended to include halogen sources, reactive halogen chemistry, and related atmospheric processes.",

            "abstract": "The major ecological controls on methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in northern wetland systems are well known, yet estimates of source/sink magnitudes are often incongruous with measured rates. This mismatch persists because holistic flux datasets are rare, preventing ‘whole picture’ determinations of flux controls. To combat this, we measured net CO2 and CH4 fluxes from September 2012-2013 within a peatland in northern Lapland, Finland. In addition, we performed in situ manipulations and in vitro soil incubations to quantify anaerobic methane oxidation and methanogenic rates as they related to alternative electron acceptor availability. Average annual fluxes varied substantially between different depressions within the wetland, a pattern that persisted through all seasons. Season was a strong predictor of both CO2 and CH4 flux rates, yet CH4 rates were not related to melt-season 10cm or 30cm soil temperatures, and only poorly predicted with air temperatures. We found evidence for both autumnal and spring thaw CH4 bursts, collectively accounting for 26% of annual CH4 flux, although the autumnal burst was more than 5 fold larger than the spring burst. CH4 ebullition measured throughout the growing season augmented the CH4 source load by a factor of 1.5, and was linked with fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within the wetland. Surprisingly, CH4 flux rates were insensitive to Fe(III) and humic acid soil amendments, both of which amplified CO2 fluxes. Using in vitro incubations, we determined anaerobic methane oxidation and methanogenesis rates. Measured anaerobic oxidation rates showed potential consumption of between 6-39% of the methane produced, contributing approximately 1% of total carbon dioxide flux. Treatments of nitrate, sulfate and ferric iron showed that nitrate suppressed methanogenesis, but were not associated with anaerobic oxidation rates.",

            "abstract": "Canopy wakes have been shown, in controlled wind tunnel experiments, to significantly affect the fluxes of momentum, heat and other scalars at the land and water surface over distances of ∼O(1 km), see Markfort et al. (EFM, 2013). However, there are currently no measurements of the velocity field downwind of a full-scale forest canopy. Point-based anemometer measurements of wake turbulence provide limited insight into the extent and details of the wake structure, whereas scanning Doppler wind LiDARs can provide information on how the wake evolves in space and varies over time.\nFor the first time, we present measurements of the velocity field in the wake of a tall patch of forest canopy. The patch consists of two uniform rows of 40-meter tall deciduous, plane trees, which border either side of the Allée de Dorigny, near the EPFL campus. The canopy is approximately 250 m long, and it is approximately 40 m wide, along the direction of the wind. A challenge faced while making field measurements is that the wind rarely intersects a canopy normal to the edge. The resulting wake flow may be deflected relative to the mean inflow. Using multiple LiDARs, we measure the evolution of the wake due to an oblique wind blowing over the canopy. One LiDAR is positioned directly downwind of the canopy to measure the flow along the mean wind direction and the other is positioned near the canopy to evaluate the transversal component of the wind and how it varies with downwind distance from the canopy. Preliminary results show that the open trunk space near the base of the canopy results in a surface jet that can be detected just downwind of the canopy and farther downwind dissipates as it mixes with the wake flow above. A time-varying recirculation zone can be detected by the periodic reversal of the velocity near the surface, downwind of the canopy. The implications of canopy wakes for measurement and modeling of surface fluxes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation (A) to water loss via transpiration, is the key physiological parameter that explicitly links water and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Most studies examining the influence of climatic factors on forest-WUE have focused on site-specific and water-limited ecosystems. Much less is known about the dynamics of WUE across different forest ecosystems, along gradients of climate and soil nutrients. This study explores the variation in WUE at twelve different forested Ameriflux sites across North America spanning a wide range of forest types and climate conditions. We were interested in answering the following questions: 1) Are patterns of WUE at the tree level similar to those for whole ecosystems? 2) Is there a consistent relationship between foliar nitrogen (N) and WUE at the two different scales? 3) To what extent does species diversity explain forest ecosystem functioning and resilience to drought? Finally, 4) Can changes in GPP, ET and WUE across the studied climate gradient be estimated using remotely derived water indices, such as NDWI? We address these questions through a combination of techniques applied at the leaf to landscape level, including foliar δ13C, δ18O and N, eddy covariance and remote sensing data. At each site, we used foliar δ13C to infer intrinsic WUE (iWUE=A/gs) for the two dominant tree species, while foliar N and δ18O provided insights about the species-specific physiological mechanisms underlying variation in iWUE. Furthermore, we used flux data to derive ET and WUEe (i.e., ecosystem WUE= GPP/ET). Variations in iWUE and WUEe in relation to foliar N, climate parameters and water stress index (PSDI) are considered across sites. Moreover, differences in GPP, ET and WUEe are explored in relation to forest ecosystem type, species richness and Shannon’s diversity index. Finally we examine the degree to which changes in WUE are related to NDVI and NDWI.",

            "abstract": "Recent theoretical development in transit time theory now allow the effects of different controls on the variability of passive tracer transport through a watershed (or any control volume) to be distinguished. The effects of variable fluxes in and out of the system, including the water balance partitioning, are accounted for explicitly. A new integral form of this theory expresses the way flow paths preferentially sample older or younger water in a convenient and physically meaningful form as a pdf of water in storage ranked by age. Variability of this pdf in time accounts for the effect of shifts in the flow pathways contributing to discharge and ET fluxes. This framework has demonstrated considerable success in reproducing the timeseries of streamflow chloride dynamics in a 28-year dataset from Plynlimon, Wales.\nHere a deeper analysis of those results will be presented, along with analyses of synthetic datasets, to examine key features of this approach. Results that connect to process understanding or have implications for applications in less data-rich watersheds are highlighted. The results show this approach can account for the 1/f fractal filtering of the observed stream chemistry by reproducing both the brief, large deviations associated with large storms and wet antecedent conditions, and the long, persistent memory of past inputs associated with baseflow release from groundwater. The fidelity of the model was further improved by allowing the sampling of age-ranked storage to shift towards younger water when catchment storage was high, and towards older water when it was low, suggesting that the shifting transport pathways associated with overland and macropore flow initiation are captured by this approach. Errors in input concentration timeseries tended to have large, persistent effects that could skew model calibration or the interpretation of results. The time-varying age distribution of catchment evapotranspiration can also be constrained by the stream chloride data due to the sensitivity of modeled evapoconcentration to assumptions about age sampling. Seasonal variations in water balance had a significant effect on the modulation of the amplitude of the seasonal discharge concentrations, with implications for the use of seasonal amplitude to infer mean transit times.",

During that period, while the science challenges have evolved, the technological advancements have been moving at breakneck speed. Therefore we have the constant challenge of providing cutting edge research experiences to undergraduate students, where the students may not have had exposure beyond their own discipline. The CSU-CHILL REU provides students experience in current research topics. Students publish in leading conferences every year, and produce high quality research.\nThis paper will provide examples of how the interface between technology and science has evolved over years, where some cross training has become easy, while some other challenges still remain.\nThis REU focuses on small groups, so that we can establish one-on-one connections between mentors and students, and instead of just involving students in cutting edge research, we have them actively create it. Students are not merely assigned a small part of a larger project, but often lead their own project. We consider mentors to be supporting their student’s research, and not the other way around. This has led to some very interesting research projects that have contributed to science, and to society at large.\nIn this presentation we will discuss some of the specific challenges that we have encountered when running an interdisciplinary REU program, as well as some of the secondary support activities that we do that extend far beyond the student's participation in the REU.",

            "abstract": "[Abstract] Lakes play a crucial role in the global water cycle and balance, are sensitive to global warming, and are vital for human water supply. There clearly is a pressing need to understand temporal and spatial variations in lake water storage globally, especially in the lake-rich Arctic/Sub-Arctic regions. An accurate systematic lake inventory, however, is unavailable at global scales. Owing to its broad spatial coverage and repeat-pass monitoring capability, satellite remote sensing is the only feasible approach to inventory global lake dynamics. Global lake mapping at high resolutions is a rather challenging task. Since lakes are abundant in small-size classes and their seasonality varies from region to region, a huge number of high-resolution satellite images need to be acquired in “appropriate” seasons. The appropriate seasons refer to the period in a typical year when lakes are relatively stable, and are determined spatially using precipitation and temperature datasets. Thousands of cloud-free Landsat images at 30 m resolution have been acquired during lake-stable seasons. Satellite lake mapping succeeds at different levels from place to place and from season to season. A set of highly replicable automated lake mapping methods and tools have been developed to tackle various situations across the entire Earth and to handle such a large volume of satellite data. The current goal is to produce a circa 2000 high-resolution global lake database in a systematic way. Millions of lakes larger than 0.5 ha have been inventoried. The product is currently examined in an intensive quality control and quality assurance process. Over six million lakes in pan-Arctic (45 deg N and above) are captured in the database and have been validated for release.",

            "abstract": "The increasing resolution of seismic tomography studies as well as techniques that are sensitive to sharp, localized velocity changes indicate that melt is present in diverse tectonic settings in the upper mantle. Unresolved questions are the quantification of seismic velocities and attenuation to melt fraction, and the dynamic stability of this melt. Properties of partially molten rocks are generally sensitive to melt geometry. The melt geometry can be observed in experiments, but the experimental observations have to be extrapolated to mantle grain sizes. High resolution images of experimentally observed melt geometries (Garapic et al., 2013) indicate that the broad attenuation peak observed by forced torsional oscillation experiments (Jackson et al., 2004, Faul et al., 2004) are due to melt ‘squirt’. Characterization of the inferred melt geometry in rocks recovered from mid-ocean ridges and peridotite massifs suggest that the experimental observations are applicable to the upper mantle. The data from the earlier seismic property experiments will be reprocessed with improved apparatus calibration and fitting strategies to provide a ‘global’ fit to the melt-bearing data as a function of grain size and melt fraction. This should allow quantification of the amount of melt imaged in seismic studies and therefore enable more accurate geodynamical models for example of arcs and backarcs, for which the highest resolution tomographic images exist. It should also provide more quantitative constraints on the amount of melt required to generate receiver functions and SS-bounces that suggest the presence of melt in the asthenosphere.",

            "abstract": "Northern temperate forests are expected to show: (1) strong carbon sink strength, particularly in regrowing forests managed for timber production; (2) positive responses of productivity to moderate increases in temperature, in particular to spring warming; (3) strong N limitation such that N additions through fertilization or deposition result in increased productivity and C uptake; (4) a low but uniform rate of methane uptake due to methanotroph activity in the soil. Data is synthesized here from eddy covariance measures of CO2 and methane flux in conjunction with large plot measurements and stand-level experimental studies to address each of these predictions – with strong evidence found AGAINST each of them. Eddy covariance measurements from 2010-2012 in a selection-managed forest measured 13-16 years following a partial stand harvest indicate a net CO2 source of from ~1-4 Mg C ha-1 y-1, in large part due to consistently high respiration rates. By far the largest carbon loss occurred in 2010, a year in which spring leaf flush by the dominant tree species Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia corresponded with seasonally exceptional temperatures of 31-33°C, and a corresponding decline in leaf-level photosynthesis and leaf area index of the dominant (but not other) tree species. Analyses of spatial variation in forest productivity and direct experimental additions of N and P suggest that the forest is not N limited, but rather co-limited by P and cations (especially Ca and Mg). In contrast to the strong observed CO2 source, the study site is a strong sink for methane, sufficiently strong that predicted climate forcing effects due to methane uptake more than offset those due to CO2 losses. Chamber studies indicate that methane uptake is not uniform, but rather that local depressions and lower slopes can show high methane emissions consistent with hypoxia effects. Current studies are examining methods of enhancing forest climate mitigation through management to address non-N nutrient limitations through use of pyrolyzed forestry mill waste material (“biochar”) as a soil amendment, and by silvicultural methods to enhance local tree species diversity, including species with more southern distributions (“passive silvicultural assisted migration”).",

            "abstract": "General circulation models predict that future forests in the U.S. Southeast will experience higher temperatures and more variable precipitation in the future, resulting in a moderate decrease in water availability (precipitation minus evapotranspiration), though considerable uncertainty in and disagreement between projections remain. The Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation Project (PINEMAP) represents an effort to understand the future of 20 million acres of planted pine forests managed by private landowners in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal states.\nDecades of productivity research on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) has led to a widespread practice of mid-rotation fertilization of loblolly plantations, supplying additional nutrients as stands approach canopy closure. It remains an open question what the effects of fertilization of pine forests in this region will be in the face of periodic or persistent droughts, in terms of forest water use and its implications to other water uses downstream.\nTherefore, we will review key results from past ecophysiological research on the responses of loblolly pine to fertilization, elevated CO2 and water availability, as well as a recent PINEMAP field trial of fertilization and drought imposed through rainfall displacement over two growing seasons. Despite high rainfall in 2013 (1224 mm compared an average 1120 mm) and a lack of leaf area response, transpiration decreased in response to fertilization and through rainfall displacement. Treatment differences were greatest in the growing season of 2013, when transpiration was on average 13.6, 20.2 and 28.7% lower in the rainfall displacement, fertilization and combined treatment than the control (46 mm/month), respectively. We will conclude by reviewing the important lessons from this research for regional models of future forests in this region in terms of LAI, transpiration, growth and water use efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Emplacement mechanisms of clastic dikes, which are discordant and tabular bodies comprised of weakly to strongly lithified clastic detritus, have been a matter of considerable interest over the last 20 years. Clastic dikes are generally classified into neptunian and injected dikes. Using the magnetic fabrics (AMS), we attempt to classify the clastic dikes in the late Cretaceous Dadaepo Basin, SE Korea, and interpret their emplacement mechanisms. The neptunian dikes exhibit a typical oblate sedimentary fabric which makes a sharp contrast with the injected dikes. The fabrics of the injected dikes are greatly influenced by current conditions (flow directions, rheological properties, and rates) and transportation types (imbrication or rolling) of filling materials. Based on the AMS fabrics, they are classified into four types. (1) Type-VP is formed by grain imbrication in low- to moderate-energy vertical flow of a Newtonian fluid and characterized by a bilateral symmetry of fabrics across the dike. (2) Type-VT results from grain rolling in vertical high-energy flow and is characterized by subvertical k2 and subhorizontal k1 axes on the dike plane. (3) Type-HP is formed by grain imbrication in horizontal low- to moderate-energy flow, resulting in subvertical k3 and subhorizontal k1 and k2 axes. (4) Type-HT is formed by grain rolling in horizontal high-energy flow, resulting in streaked k2-k3 on the dike plane and horizontally clustered k1 axes. The AMS fabrics of each type can be a significant indicator for flow direction. The observed AMS fabric of low-energy current immediately above the source layer indicates that fluidized clastic materials in the lower part of injected dike can flow laterally by lateral propagation of new or pre-existing fractures due to a dominant horizontal pressure gradient. Based on abundant AMS fabrics of high-energy current, coexistence of paleoseismic structures, and tectonic setting of the basin, earthquake-induced liquefaction is the most plausible trigger for the dike formation. Systematic attitudes of the injected dikes also indicate their potential as a powerful tool for reconstructing paleostress field.",

            "abstract": "Much of our society, including our agriculture, our dependence on natural resources, and our infrastructure, is built on the assumption that individual weather events and average conditions may vary from year to year, but over the long term the climate of a given region can be predicted based on past climate “normals”. This assumption is no longer valid; today, human-induced climate change is altering average conditions as well as the risk of many types of weather extremes.\nObserved trends and projected future changes in mean climate and in the frequency and severity of temperature extremes, heat waves, heavy precipitation events, coastal flooding, and storms are clearly documented in the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment, as well as by a host of other regional impact assessments. While future projections are inherently uncertain, these assessments make one fact clear: future planning for any sector or region affected by climate change that fails to take into account long-term trends will end up with the wrong answer.\nThis concept of non-stationarity, that future climate will differ from that experienced in the past, challenges regional planners, water managers, city managers and engineers to incorporate future climate change into present-day planning. From the perspective of scientists, translating climate projections into information that can be used by stakeholders and decision-makers presents a challenge of equal magnitude.\nHere, I draw on my experience working with the agriculture, ecosystem, energy, health, infrastructure, insurance, and water sectors to propose a framework for, and highlight some of the main challenges inherent to, incorporating climate information into practical, on-the-ground planning at the local to regional scale. This approach, which we have developed through working with a range of cities, states, and regions including Austin, Cambridge, California, Chicago, Delaware, the Northeast, and most recently Washington DC, is based on identifying known vulnerabilities within the systems of interest, and developing appropriate information compatible with existing planning mechanisms to ensure the relevance and utility of the climate information for increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate risks.",

            "abstract": "Anaerobic conditions common in peatlands lead microbes to reduce alternative electron acceptors for respiration in the order of their energetic yield: nitrate, manganese, ferric iron (Fe[III]), sulfate, and CO2. Many studies of peatland respiration report high CO2 fluxes that cannot be completely explained by measured pathways of microbial metabolism: it appears that an unquantified pool of electron acceptors is driving respiration and the efflux of CO2. The notion that undetected iron reduction may be an important contributing factor to these fluxes has been proposed, but has yet to be addressed. Among the possible causes for this anomaly is the widespread use of colorimetric assays for iron quantitation and speciation. Peat porewater contains high concentrations of dissolved humic and fulvic acids that occlude Fe(III), blocking colorimetric complex formation, potentially leading to an underestimate of Fe(III) in these challenging analytical matrices.\nWe evaluated a novel ionic liquid extraction method in a variety of temperate peatland porewater samples and compared these results to data acquired simultaneously using colorimetric methods. We found a >50% average improvement in accuracy for total iron quantitation using ionic liquid extraction. Moreover, ionic liquid extraction of peat porewater consistently recovered Fe(III) whereas colorimetric methods detected 50-100% less, suggesting that DOM bound Fe(III) is not reliably detected using colorimetric assays in these systems and may represent a previously unidentified pool of electron acceptors in peat porewater.",

            "abstract": "Martian magmas are thought to be rich in chlorine compared with their terrestrial counterparts. Consistent with other Martian meteorites, apatite grains in Martian meteorite NWA 6234 are dominantly Cl-apatite suggesting that the parental magma to NWA 6234 may have been rich in Cl. Here we experimentally investigate the effect of chlorine on liquidus depression and near liquidus crystallization of a synthetic composition of NWA 6234 and compare these results with previous experimental results on the effect of chlorine on near-liquidus crystallization.\nPrevious experimental results using two different starting synthetic Martian basalt compositions showed that the change of liquidus temperature is dependent on the bulk composition of the basalt. The effect of Cl on liquidus depression is greater for lower SiO2, higher Al2O3 magmas than higher SiO2, lower Al2O3 magmas, possibly due to an affinity for Cl to complex with network-modifying cations. The bulk composition for this study has an intermediate Al2O3 content; therefore, we can further constrain the effect of the bulk composition on the influence of chlorine on near-liquidus crystallization.\nHigh pressure and temperature crystallization experiments were performed at 10 Kbar (1 GPa) on a synthetic basalt, of the bulk composition of NWA 6234, with 0 - 4 wt% Cl added to the sample as AgCl. The preliminary results are consistent with previous notions that with increasing wt. % Cl in the melt the crystallization temperature decreases. Importantly, our results have a liquidus depression ∆T (oC) from added chlorine that is intermediate between the two previous results. This is consistent with the difference in bulk composition, i.e., this work has an intermediate Al-composition. This suggests that the addition of Cl to the Martian mantle may lower the solidus temperature and potentially aid in the petrogenesis of aluminous basalts.",

            "abstract": "The continental margins of the eastern United States formed in the Early Jurassic after the breakup of supercontinent Pangea. The relationship between the timing of this rift episode and the occurrence of offshore magmatism, which is expressed in the East Coast Magnetic Anomaly, is still unknown. The possible influence of magmatism and existing lithospheric structure on the rifting processes along margin of the eastern U.S. was one of the motivations to conduct a large-scale community seismic experiment in the Eastern North America (ENAM) GeoPRISMS focus site. In addition, there is also a clear need for better high-resolution seismic data with shallow penetration on this margin to better understand the geological setting of submarine landslides.\nThe ENAM community seismic experiment is a project in which a team of scientists will gather both active-source and earthquake seismic data in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras on a 500 km wide section of the margin offshore North Carolina and Virginia. The timing of data acquisition in 2014 and 2015 facilitates leveraging of other geophysical data acquisition programs such as Earthscope’s Transportable Array and the USGS marine seismic investigation of the continental shelf. In April of 2014, 30 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers were deployed on the shelf, slope and abyssal plain of the study site. These instruments will record earthquakes for one year, which will help future seismic imaging of the deeper lithosphere beneath the margin. In September and October of 2014, regional marine seismic reflection and refraction data will be gathered with the seismic vessel R/V Marcus Langseth, and airgun shots will also be recorded on land to provide data coverage across the shoreline. Last, in the summer of 2015, a land explosion seismic refraction study will provide constraints on the crustal structure in the adjacent coastal plain of North Carolina and Virginia. All seismic data will be distributed to the community through IRIS/DMC and the LDEO/UTIG Seismic data center. Two workshops are planned for 2015, where new users get an opportunity to engage in basic processing and analysis of the new data set.",

            "abstract": "Little is known about the detailed vertical and horizontal structure of the Tropical Cyclone (TC) outflow layer owing to lack of in-situ observations in this region over the years. We hypothesize that TC outflow structure change due either to external environmental interactions or internal dynamical changes are related to TC intensity changes, making the outflow layer an important region of study for improvement of TC predictability. Dropsonde profiles through TC outflow layers were obtained during the Hurricane and Severe Storms Sentinel (HS3) experiment (2012-2014) and the Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI) experiment (2014). Using mini-dropsondes deployed with the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS) from a NASA Global Hawk and eXpendable Digital Dropsondes (XDDs) deployed with the High Definition Sounding System (HDSS) from a NASA WB-57F, new insights into the vertical structure of the TC outflow layer have been obtained.\nAtmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) show that ‘far-field’ outflow jet dropsondes in Hurricane Leslie (2012) were obtained during a period of jet development and deformation in response the ‘pincer effect’ of an upper trough to the east and an upper cold low to west of Leslie. We speculate that the resulting deformation of the outflow layer and associated jet feature may have been responsible for limiting further development of Leslie. AMVs in Hurricane Nadine (2012) and pre-TC Gabrielle (2013) showed that outflow jets sampled by dropsondes developed over time scales of several hours. Wind profile observations in outflow jet ‘roots’ near ‘convective bursts’ showed that they were weaker and thicker near the convection and became thinner and stronger downstream as the ‘far-field’ region was sampled.\nAll dropsonde profiles showed that the outflow layer contained numerous thin isothermal layers and layers of enhanced vertical wind shear. These numerous thin unstable layers were characterized by a super-critical Richardson number in excess of ¼. The outflow layer therefore appears to contain multiple transient thin unstable layers generating turbulence that may play a role in the dynamics of the outflow layer and its impact on TC predictability.",

            "abstract": "The topic of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has garnered extensive interest over the past few decades. Many initial studies of SGD focused on karstic aquifers or small sandy systems. SGD associated with large river deltas has often been overlooked; though the limited number of studies that exist suggest it is important. This oversight is important, as large rivers are one of the primary pathways by which water and dissolved materials flow from the continents to the oceans. Deltas are also important loci for nutrient regeneration, carbon sequestration and authigenic mineral formation; and exchanges between salt and freshwater in these systems could be of geochemical importance globally. This talk will examine the topic of deltaic SGD, its regional and global implications, and use case studies from ongoing work in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD). Recent results indicate that SGD in the MRD averages 1,000 m3 s-1, and can reach 5,000 m3 s-1; making this system one the 25 largest pathways for water transport in North America. Flow appears to be driven by the stage differential between the Mississippi River and its surrounding wetlands, and likely passes through paleochannels and other buried semi-permeable bodies. This process may be amplified by a network of levees that inflate river stages, particularly during floods. Given the increases in flood control structures that may be built to cope with changing climates, deltaic SGD may become more important during the Anthropocene.",

These large volumes make it difficult to aggregate or summarize their climatology and climate trends. It is especially cumbersome to supply the full derivation (provenance) of these aggregate calculations. We present a lightweight and resilient software platform, Gridderama that simplifies the calculation of climatology by exploiting the \"Data-Cube\" topology often present in earth observing satellite records. By using the large array storage (LAS) paradigm, Gridderama allows the analyst to more easily produce a series of aggregate climate data products at progressively coarser spatial and temporal resolutions. Furthermore, provenance tracking and extensive visualization capabilities allow the analyst to track down and correct for data problems such as missing data and outliers that may impact the scientific results.\nWe have developed and applied Gridderama to calculate a trend analysis of 55 Terabytes of AIRS Level 1b infrared radiances, and show statistically significant trending in the greenhouse gas absorption bands as observed by AIRS over the 2003-2012 decade. We will extend this calculation to show regional changes in CO2 concentration from AIRS over the 2003-2012 decade by using a neural network retrieval algorithm.",

            "abstract": "In nature soil biophysical and biogeochemical processes are coupled spatially and temporally. However due to constrain of both understanding of complexity of process interactions and computing ability, it still remains a challenge to represent fully coupled system of soil hydrological-thermal dynamics and biogeochemical processes in land surface models (LSMs). In the Community Land Model (CLM), the land component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), soil C-N processes are not only implemented sequentially but also asynchronously coupled to thermal and hydrological processes. PFLOTRAN is an open source, state-of-the-art massively parallel 3-D subsurface flow and reactive transport code. In this study, we extend the subsurface hydrological-thermal process coupling between CLM and PFLOTRAN to include explicitly synchronized soil biogeochemical processes. The resulting coupled CLM-PFLOTRAN model is a LSM capable of resolving 3-D soil hydrological-thermal-biogeochemical processes.\nThe classic CLM-CN reaction networks, degassing-dissolving of C-N relevant greenhouse gases between soil solution and air, soil N absorption and transportation processes are implemented in PFLOTRAN’s reactive-transport framework. We compare soil C stock estimates from CLM alone and coupled CLM-PFLOTRAN simulations at the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment-Arctic field sites at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), AK. Both simulations are compared against available soil C dataset to assess importance of representing this synchronization in LSMs. Contributions of various factors to spatial variance of simulated variations from the two modeling approaches are evaluated across this polygonal coastal tundra landscape. Results indicate that two modeling approaches could produce very contrasting results, especially in the N-limit ecosystem. The developed CLM-PFLOTRAN framework will be used for regional evaluation of climate change caused ecosystem process responses and their feedbacks to climate system.\nKey word: Soil C stocks, soil biogeochemistry, soil thermal-hydrology, synchronization, CLM-CN model, PFLOTRAN model, polygonal coastal tundra",

            "abstract": "An array of porewater wells at two locations on Hawaiian reefs have been utilized to obtain interstitial pore fluid from various depths in permeable sandy sediments. The total alkalinity (AT) and pH (total scale) were measured for each sample (depths 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, and 60 cm) as well as calcium, magnesium, and strontium concentrations. Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations co-vary and appear to be directly related to AT and pH. The ratio of the change in calcium and magnesium (ΔCa, ΔMg) between the overlying water column and the porewater indicates that an 18 mol % Mg-calcite phase is dissolving within the sediment column. This could represent the dissolution of coralline algae such as Porolithon or Lithothamnion both of which produce ~18% Mg-calcite skeletons and are present on Hawaiian reefs. The small changes in Mg concentrations from dissolution/precipitation of high Mg-calcites is typically difficult to measure against the high background matrix of seawater and to our knowledge these data represent some of the first magnesium concentrations measured in permeable sediments.\nSaturation state (Ω) for Mg-calcites was calculated using both sets of stoichiometric solubility products (K) widely accepted in the literature. Depending on the K used, most of the porewater was undersaturated with respect to the high Mg calcites (>12%). Saturation states were determined using an ion activity product (IAP) calculated from the measured values of calcium and magnesium. This produces a more accurate Ω than assuming calcium and magnesium concentrations based on salinity, as is typically done in surface waters. As surface water becomes more corrosive to carbonate minerals due to enhanced ocean acidification through the next century, it is expected that dissolution of both biogenic high Mg-calcites and abiotic Mg-calcite cements will increase, potentially destabilizing reef framework and altering the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in these environments.",

A stretched cubed-sphere High Resolution Atmosphere Model (HiRAM) is constructed using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) finite-volume dynamical core. The horizontal grid spacing in the stretched cubed-sphere is smoothly transformed from the center of highest-resolution region to the center of coarsest-resolution region.\nThree 30-yr AMIP type simulations were performed in this study; one C384 uniformed cubed-sphere grid, and two stretched cubed-sphere grid with stretching factor 2.5. Two stretched-grid experiments further set the center of highest-resolution region in Taiwan (C384R2.5TW) and Oklahoma City (C384R2.5OKC), respectively. The horizontal resolution in this C384R2.5 stretched grid ranges from 10km to 65km. Three climate simulations were compared against re-analysis data to understand the effect of horizontal resolution on both the simulated global climate and regional features.\nThe global mean climatology in stretched-grid AMIP simulations shows no unrealistic drift comparing to the uniform-grid simulation and observation. Regional orographic precipitation is better simulated in the high-resolution region. High resolution also shows improvement in typhoon/hurricane simulation. In western Pacific basin, high resolution improves simulated typhoon intensity. For weak and moderate typhoons, there is no strong trend with enhancing resolution. But for strong typhoon, there is high correlation between enhancing resolution with typhoon intensity. By comparing simulations with IBTrACS （International Best Track Archieve for Climate Stewardship） in different basins, HiRAM demonstrates the reduction of simulated typhoon/hurricane numbers with enhancement of horizontal resolution.",

            "abstract": "The problem of ground subsidence due to fluid withdrawal becomes a topic of major importance when arid conditions resulting from extreme climate change events necessitates accessing the ground water regime to provide water for human consumption, agricultural and other industrial activities. A collateral effect of groundwater extraction is ground subsidence. The subsidence can be induced by alterations in the pore fluid pressures in an aquifer without the need for alterations to ground water levels. This paper examines the ground subsidence created by the uniform extraction of fluids from a flat disc-shaped extraction region located within fluid-saturated poroelastic domain, which results in the reduction in the pore water pressure within the flat disc-shaped region. In particular, attention is focused on the influence of the fluid extraction on a surficial layer that is elastic and can be modelled as a thick plate-type stratum. The influence of the fluid extraction over a flat circular region is modelled as a distribution of centers of dilatation. It is shown that the elastostatic model can be used to provide convenient estimates for the influences of the fluid extraction process on subsidence.",

As result of tropical weathering and dissolution of the silicates that constitute the peridotites, extensive evidences of chemical weathering are observed (dolines, enlarged fractures, epikarst). In particular the South of the Grande Terre, called « Plaine des lacs » presents a landscape but also hydraulic behaviour similar to karstic aquifers, with numerous dolines generally observed as ponds. A morphometric study of these depressions is proposed based on field observations and on automatic mapping from the DEM obtained with LIDAR technology. From SIG calculations followed by manual cleaning, a 8601 dataset of dolines is defined on a 128 km2 area, whose area varies from 1 m2 to 2 km2 area. A statistical analysis is applied on the morphometric parameters of dolines and other factors as amount of precipitation or the distance to characteristic mophologic features (ridges, rivers). Fractal and alignment analysis are presented to detect the potential relationship between dolines, the phenomena involved in their formation and evolution. The role of chemical weathering, and of mechanical erosion are discussed as well as the condition required for doline formation. A comparison with limestone karsitification is drawn.",

Thus, over the past several years 150+ scientists and practitioners representing a range of expertise from the climate system to natural systems to human sectors have developed a set of indicator recommendations that could be used as a first step to establishing such an indicator system. These recommendations have been implemented into a pilot system, with the goal of working with stakeholder communities to evaluate the understandability of individual indicators and learn how users are combining indicators for their own understanding or decision needs through this multiple Federal agency decision support platform.\nThis prototype system provides the perfect test bed for evaluating the translation of scientific data – observations, remote sensing, and citizen science data -- and data products, such as indicators, for decision-making audiences. Often translation of scientific information into decision support products is developed and improved given intuition and feedback. Though this can be useful in many cases, more rigorous testing using social science methodologies would provide greater assurance that the data products are useful for the intended audiences. I will present some initial research using surveys to assess the understandability of indicators and whether that understanding is influenced by one’s attitude toward climate change. Such information is critical to assess whether products developed for scientists by scientists have been appropriately translated for non-scientists, thus assuring that the data will have some value for the intended audience. Such survey information will provide a data driven approach to further develop and improve the National Climate Indicators System and could be applied to improve other decision support systems.",

            "abstract": "The 2006 eruption from Raoul Island occurred apparently in response to local tectonic swarm activity, but without any precursory indication of volcanic unrest within the hydrothermal system on the island. The eruption released some 200 T of SO2, implicating the involvement of a deep magmatic vapor input into the system during/prior to the event. In the absence of any recognized juvenile material in the eruption products, previous explanations for this eruptive event focused on this vapor being a driving force for the eruption.\nIn 2004, at least 80 T/d of CO2 was escaping from the hydrothermal system, but mainly through areas that did not correspond to the 2006 eruption vents. The lack of a pre-eruptive hydrothermal system response related to the seismic event in 2006 can be explained by the presence of a hydrothermal mineralogic seal in the vent area of the volcano. Evidence for the existence of such a seal was found in eruption deposits in the form of massive fracture fillings of aragonite, calcite and anhydrite. Fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures in these phases range from ca. 140 °C to 220 °C which, for pure water indicate boiling point depths of between 40 and 230 m assuming a cold hydrostatic pressure constraint. Elevated pressures behind this seal are consistent with the occurrence of CO2 clathrates in some inclusion fluids, indicating CO2 concentrations approaching 1 molal in the parent fluids.\nReactive transport modeling of magmatic volatile inputs into what is effectively a seawater-dominated hydrothermal system provide valuable insights into seal formation. Carbonate mineral phases ultimately come to saturation along this flow path, but we suggest that focused deposition of the observed massive carbonate seal is facilitated by near-surface boiling of these CO2-enriched altered seawaters, leading to large degrees of supersaturation which are required for the formation of aragonite. As the seal grew and permeability declined, pore pressures increased until a state of critical stress was achieved. The eruption of 2006 was probably triggered by further deep release of magmatic volatiles brought about by intense shaking of the local tectonic swarm event, and the addition of these gases further increased pore pressures, and ultimately led to the failure of the already critically stressed seal.",

Equilibrium enables paleotemeperature estimates and inferences regarding past carbon cycling. Kinetic isotope effects/vital effects make such interpretations tenuous.\nWe present a series of experiments on the kinetics of CO2- H2O isotopic equilibration. We observe a simple asymptotic approach of δ18OCO2 to equilibrium values. However, Δ47 values exhibit systematic excursions from a smooth trajectory towards equilibrium. These excursions help illuminate relative reaction rates for different isotopologues in the interconversion reactions among dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species and between CO2 and H2O. The use of Δ47 measurements reveals the conditions under which isotopic equilibrium vs. disequilibrium among DIC species prevails. This is relevant to systems with rapid rates of organismal uptake of DIC (e.g., photosynthesis in corals) and release of DIC (e.g., respiration in many genera of calcifiers).",

            "abstract": "We are measuring total mercury (HgT) and monomethylmercury (CH3Hg+ or MMHg) in pore water, surface water, and sediment cores from two salt marsh pond systems on the south shore of Cape Cod, MA to characterize the distribution of mercury species and to identify features that influence mercury speciation and transport. Sage Lot Pond is relatively undisturbed and has low nitrogen loading (12 kg ha-1 y-1). It is part of the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Reserve and is surrounded by undeveloped wooded uplands. In contrast, Great Pond is highly impacted. Nitrogen loading to the site is elevated (600 kg ha-1 y-1) and the marsh is adjacent to a large residential area. In both systems, a 1 to 2 m organic-rich peat layer overlies the permeable sand aquifer. Groundwater in this region is typically oxic, where pore water within salt marsh peat is suboxic to anoxic. We hypothesize that redox gradients at the transition from the root zone to peat and at the peat-sand interface may provide habitat for MMHg-producing anaerobic bacteria. Preliminary results from a 2-m nearshore depth profile at Sage Lot Pond indicate HgT in groundwater within the sand aquifer occurred primarily in the > 0.2 µm fraction, with unfiltered concentrations exceeding 100 pM. Filtered (< 0.2 µm) HgT in groundwater was substantially lower (~ 5 pM). In contrast, HgT concentrations in filtered and unfiltered pore water within the peat layer were similar and ranged from about 2 to 3 pM. Complexation between mercury and dissolved organic carbon may account for the elevated fraction of filtered HgT in peat pore water. Although MMHg in both groundwater and pore water remained around 1 pM throughout our depth profile, we observed an increase in sediment MMHg (0.3 to 1.6 µg/kg) at the peat-sand interface. MMHg comprised ~50% of the HgT concentration in pore water suggesting mercury in the salt marsh peat is biologically available.",

The great success of these networks has encouraged the development of new, up-and-coming, networks such as the Long Term Agricultural Network (LTAR) and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), to name a few.\nNEON is responsible for making observations of terrestrial, aquatic, and organismal ecology at 106 sites in 20 different eco-climatic domains across the North American continent. NEON will provide data on key local biogeochemical, meteorological, climate, remote sensing, and chemical variables, as well as their associated biotic responses, in an effort to inform climate change, land-use change, and invasive species.  Great care has been taken to ensure that NEON is being built to complement and expand upon the knowledge that has been gained from these other long-term observing networks.

            "abstract": "The recent success in using Synchrotron X-ray Computed Microtomography (SXCMT) for the quantification of nanoparticle concentrations within real, three-dimensional pore networks [1] has opened up new opportunities for collecting experimental data of pore-scale flow and transport processes. One opportunity is coupling SXCMT with nanoparticle/soil transport experiments to provide unique insights into how pore-scale processes influence transport at larger scales. Understanding these processes is a key step in accurately upscaling micron-scale phenomena to the continuum-scale.\nUpscaling phenomena from the micron-scale to the continuum-scale typically involves the assumption that the pore space is well mixed. Using this ‘well mixed assumption’ it is implicitly assumed that the distribution of nanoparticles within the pore does not affect its retention by soil grains. This assumption enables the use of volume-averaged parameters in calculating transport and retention rates. However, in some scenarios, the well mixed assumption will likely be violated by processes such as deposition and diffusion. These processes can alter the distribution of the nanoparticles in the pore space and impact retention behaviour, leading to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.\nThis work investigates the well mixed assumption by employing SXCMT to experimentally examine pore-scale mixing of silver nanoparticles during transport through sand packed columns. Silver nanoparticles were flushed through three different sands to examine the impact of grain distribution and nanoparticle retention rates on mixing: uniform silica (low retention), well graded silica sand (low retention) and uniform iron oxide coated silica sand (high retention). The SXCMT data identified diffusion-limited retention as responsible for violations of the well mixed assumption. A mathematical description of the diffusion-limited retention process was created and compared to the experimental data at the pore and column-scale. The mathematical description accurately predicted trends observed within the SXCMT-datasets such as concentration gradients away from grain surfaces and also accurately predicted total retention of nanoparticles at the column scale.\n1.

            "abstract": "The relative chain-length distribution and carbon-isotope composition of n-alkanes extracted from sedimentary rocks are important geochemical tools for investigating past terrestrial ecosystems. Alkanes preserved in ancient sediments are assumed to be contemporaneous, derived from the same ecosystem, and integrated from the biomass present on the landscape at the time of deposition. Further, there is an underlying assumption that ancient plants exhibited the same metabolic and physiological responses to climate conditions that are observed for modern plants. Interpretations of alkane abundances and isotopic signatures are complicated by the strong influence of phylogenetic affiliation and ecological factors, such as canopy structure. A better understanding of how ecosystem and taxa influence alkane properties, including homologue abundance patterns and leaf-lipid carbon isotope fractionation would help strengthen paleoecological interpretations based on these widely employed plant biomarkers.\nIn this study, we analyze the alkane chain-length distribution and carbon-isotope composition of phytoleim and alkanes (d13Cleaf and d13Clipid) extracted from a selection of Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil leaves from the Guaduas and Cerrejon Formations of Colombia. These data were compared with data for the same families in a modern analogue biome. Photosynthetic and biosynthetic fractionation (∆leaf and elipid) values determined from the fossil material indicate carbon metabolism patterns were similar to modern plants. Fossil data were incorporated in a biomass-weighted mixing model to represent the expected lipid complement of sediment arising from this ecosystem and compared with alkane measurements from the rock matrix. Modeled and observed isotopic and abundance patterns match well for alkane homologs most abundant in plants (i.e., n-C27 to n-C33). The model illustrates the importance of understanding biases in litter flux and taphonomic pressures inherent in the fossil lipid record, and it highlights the influence of community composition and forest structure on sedimentary lipids.",

            "abstract": "The literature of hydrologic modelling shows that in daily simulation of the rainfall-runoff relationship, the simulated hydrograph response to some rainfall events happens one day earlier than the observed one. This one-day offset issue results in significant residuals between the simulated and observed hydrographs and adversely impacts the model performance metrics that are based on the aggregation of daily residuals. Based on the analysis of sub-daily rainfall and runoff data sets in this study, the one-day offset issue appears to be inevitable when the same time interval, e.g. the calendar day, is used to measure daily rainfall and runoff data sets. This is an error introduced through data aggregation and needs to be properly addressed before calculating the model performance metrics. Otherwise, the metrics would not represent the modelling quality and could mislead the automatic calibration of the model. In this study, an algorithm is developed to scan the simulated hydrograph against the observed one, automatically detect all one-day offset incidents and shift the simulated hydrograph of those incidents one day forward before calculating the performance metrics. This algorithm is employed in the automatic calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool that is set up for the Rouge River watershed in Southern Ontario, Canada. Results show that with the proposed algorithm, the automatic calibration to maximize the daily Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) identifies a solution that accurately estimates the magnitude of peak flow rates and the shape of rising and falling limbs of the observed hydrographs. But, without the proposed algorithm, the same automatic calibration finds a solution that systematically underestimates the peak flow rates in order to perfectly match the timing of simulated and observed peak flows.",

            "abstract": "In subduction systems, sediments are deformed under complicated loading conditions in time and space. Although quantification of in situ stress and pore pressure at depth is crucial for understanding the absolute strength and the range of slip behaviors along megathrust faults, direct measurements of these quantities are very limited. Our recent work has used empirical relations between sonic velocity, porosity, and stress defined through a suite of laboratory deformation experiments on sediment cores to estimate in situ stress from seismic survey data along the megathrust plate boundary in the Nankai Trough [Kitajima and Saffer, 2012]. Here, we extend this analysis to examine the effects of loading path and lithology in detail, and to quantify in-situ pore pressure and stress state throughout the subduction complex - including the underthrust section, the accretionary prism, and overlying Kumano basin.\nTo first order, different loading paths do not affect the relationship between P-wave velocity and porosity for a given sediment, but they do affect the relationship between porosity and effective mean stress: at the same effective mean stress, sediments are more compacted with increasing differential stress. The relations between P-wave velocity, porosity, and effective mean stress are also different for different lithologies. In particular, the empirical relations defined by our laboratory experiments are markedly different for sands and mudstones. Based on an estimation of in situ stress and pore pressure for a range of possible scenarios with different lithologies and loading paths, we suggest that the Kumano basin is loaded in a uniaxial stress condition, whereas the prism and underthrust section are most likely loaded along a near critical stress condition with lateral compression.",

The Jefferson Project is a joint effort between RPI, IBM and the Fund for Lake George aimed at creating an instrumented water ecosystem along with an appropriate cyberinfrastructure that can serve as a global model for ecosystem monitoring, exploration, understanding, and prediction. One goal is to help communities understand the potential impacts of actions such as road salting strategies so that they can make appropriate informed recommendations that serve broad community needs. Our semantic eScience team is creating a semantic infrastructure to support data integration and analysis to help trained scientists as well as the general public to better understand the lake today, and explore potential future scenarios.

Revelation of this phenomenon will help us further understanding the impact of climate change on vegetation. Assessment and forecast of global environmental change can be also improved under further climate change. Here we present space diversity and time-lag effects patterns of global vegetation respond to three climate factors (temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) based on quantitative analysis of satellite data (NDVI) and Climate data (Climate Research Unit). We assessed the time-lag effects of global vegetation to main climate factors based on the great correlation fitness between NDVI and the three climate factors respectively among 0-12 months’ temporal lags. On this basis, integrated response model of NDVI and the three climate factors was built to analyze contribution of different climate factors to vegetation growth with multiple regression model and partial correlation model. In the result, different vegetation types have distinct temporal lags to the three climate factors. For the precipitation, temporal lags of grasslands are the shortest while the evergreen broad-leaf forests are the longest, which means that grasslands are more sensitive to precipitation than evergreen broad-leaf forests. Analysis of different climate factors’ contribution to vegetation reveal that vegetation are dominated by temperature in the high northern latitudes; they are mainly restricted by precipitation in arid and semi-arid areas (Australia, Western America); in humid areas of low and intermediate latitudes (Amazon, Eastern America), vegetation are mainly influenced by solar radiation. Our results reveal the time-lag effects and major driving factors of global vegetation growth and explain the spatiotemporal variations of global vegetation in last 30 years. Significantly, it is as well as in forecasting and assessing the influences of future climate change on the vegetation dynamics.\nThis work was supported by the High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant NO.2013AA122801).",

            "abstract": "The West Iberia continental margin is a type locale for magma-poor rifting, and studies there have been instrumental in changing the classical view of the ocean-continent transition (OCT) from a discrete boundary juxtaposing continental and oceanic crust, into a more complicated zone of varying width that can include exhumed mantle. This study examines two new seismic lines in the Galicia Bank area extending west of the Peridotite Ridge, showing high resolution images of five new ridges. These ridges could be hyperextended continental crust, exhumed continental mantle, or rough ultra-slow spreading oceanic crust. There are no tilted fault blocks with pre-syn rift stratigraphy that would indicate continental crust. There are also no faults indicating mid-ocean spreading with seismic layer stratigraphy indicating normal oceanic crust. The ridges have no coherent internal seismic structure, and some resemble the topographic profile of the Peridotite Ridge. Therefore, it is likely the western ridges are also mainly composed of serpentinized mantle. These western ridges are also similar to small oceanic core complexes observed along the active part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which also contain exhumed serpentinized mantle. This implies that there is a gradual transition within our study area from continental extension to seafloor spreading. Exhumation of continental mantle results in the formation of peridotite ridges, then transitions to episodic volcanism, which produces local thin basaltic crust, and exhumation of oceanic core complexes. Asymmetric processes during initial rifting and spreading results in contrasting structures on the two resulting margins.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Dark Target (DT) algorithm now has a record of nearly 15 years. During that time, there have been many studies to evaluate the retrieved AOD product, including direct comparison with the AOD reported by ground-based sun photometers. The result has been the rigorous “validation” of the DT products, in that the agreement between retrieved and observed AOD has been quantified on a global scale. For example, validation means that >68% of the MODIS data (or one standard deviation) agrees to the ground-truth, within a specified error envelope. However, validation does not tell a user anything about specific aerosol retrieval cases. Therefore, our team is taking the next logical step and developing the framework for deriving per-pixel retrieval uncertainty. The retrieval uncertainty in AOD comes from (1) non-linearity the algorithm’s look-up-table approach and (2) various assumptions made prior to and during the retrieval. Some of these assumptions include errors in the observed reflectance (calibration or missing data), standard deviation of the reflectance over the retrieval box, non-aerosol (e.g. gas absorption and Rayleigh) atmospheric corrections, and characterization of the surface reflectance. We will discuss the methodology of our framework and present a year’s worth of global and regional analysis of the uncertainty our AOD retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Large river systems are major economic engines that provide national economic wealth in transporting commerce and providing extensive agriculture production, and their coastal deltas are sites of significant ports, energy resources and fisheries. These coupled natural and social systems from the catchment to the coast depend on how national policies manage the river basins that they depend. The fundamental principle of the Mississippi River Basin, as in all basins, is to capitalize on the ability of fertile soil that moves from erosional regions of a large watershed, through downstream regions of the catchment where sediment transport and storage builds extensive floodplains, to the coastal region of deposition where deltas capture sediment and nutrients before exported to the oceans. The fate of soil, and the ability of that soil to do work, supports the goods and services along its path from the catchment to the coast in all large river basin and delta systems. Sediment is the commodity of all large river basin systems that together with the seasonal pulse of floods across the interior of continents provide access to the sea forming the assets that civilization and economic engines have tapped to build national and global wealth. Coastal landscapes represent some of the most altered ecosystems worldwide and often integrate the effects of processes over their entire catchment, requiring systemic solutions to achieve restoration goals from alluvial floodplains upstream to coastal deltaic floodplains downstream. The urgent need for wetland rehabilitation at landscape scales has been initiated through major floodplain reclamation and hydrologic diversions to reconnect the river with wetland processes. But the constraints of sediment delivery and nutrient enrichment represent some critical conflicts in earth surface processes that limit the ability to design ‘self sustaining’ public work projects; particularly with the challenges of accelerated sea level rise. Only through rethinking how we manage the Mississippi River not only to provide for navigation and flood control, but also as the critical source of sediments to stabilize degrading wetlands, will restoration be realized in a 100-year project cycle.",

Aquifer properties cannot be determined from a single borehole and traditional aquifer tests are difficult to design and analyze without prior knowledge of the subsurface permeability distribution. Using passive monitoring of the water level responses to tidal strains in wells allows for characterization of the aquifer over greater spatial extent and can be used to guide the design and implementation of aquifer tests. In this study, the water level response to tidal strains measured in over 20 groundwater wells, spaced irregularly over an approximately 48 km2 area, was used to estimate the specific storage and transmissivity of the surrounding granite aquifer. The water level data were corrected to remove barometric pressure effects before the amplitude and phase shifts for the O1 and M2 components of the tidal potential were calculated. Systematic differences in the calculated aquifer characteristics were observed. The differences correlate with the density of fractures observed in borehole geophysical logs. The aquifer properties derived from the earth-tide analysis were compared to those derived from aquifer tests conducted at two of the wells analyzed. The two methods yielded similar results.",

            "abstract": "Discussion of climate policy has focused almost exclusively on comprehensive regulatory instruments to price emissions with tradeable permits or emissions taxes. More recently, a number of proposals have been advanced to abandon comprehensive emissions pricing in favor of focusing exclusively on clean-energy innovation. Neither approach adequately accounts for the combination of timing and scale. Advocates of emissions pricing are persuasive that this is the most likely way to reduce emissions sufficiently to stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at desirable levels. However, as innovation advocates point out, the political climate is inhospitable to such sweeping regulations and it is unlikely that comprehensive carbon pricing can be enacted and implemented in the next decade. However, clean-energy innovation by itself is a high-stakes gamble that may fail to reduce emissions sufficiently to stabilize GHG concentrations, and may reduce support for the kind of comprehensive pricing measures that could stabilize GHG concentrations.\nWe propose that analysis of climate policies take account of the opportunity costs associated with the process of enacting a proposed policy: If one measure is much more controversial than another, how does the difference in time necessary to persuade the public and legislators to adopt them affect their ultimate impact? As General Patton is reputed to have said, \"A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution applied ten minutes later.\" Similarly, it is important to consider whether adopting one measure would build or erode support for complementary ones.\nAs an example, we consider the largely neglected role of nonregulatory measures, such as private governance and household-level behavior change, as examples of actions that could buy time by producing rapid, although modest, impacts without eroding support for more comprehensive measures later on.",

            "abstract": "The Georgina Basin portion of the Centralian Suberbasin locally preserves extensive successions of Neoproterozoic sediments, including some of the thickest Cryogenian glacial deposits in the world. Surficial exposure of these units is poor, however, necessitating description and sampling of subsurface stratigraphic records. We have examined drillcore from boreholes in the southern part of the Georgina Basin that penetrate particularly thick accumulations of glaciogenic strata. One of these cores includes, in stratigraphic succession, ~500 meters of laminated diamictite, an overlying 150 meters of coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate, and an upper 30 meter interval of carbonate that includes conspicuous pink dolostone. C isotope values of the carbonate interval are approximately -1‰ at its base, rise to values around 0‰ within the pink dolostone, then decline to -1 to -2% at the top of the cored interval. While it is currently unclear whether the carbonate is a Neoproterozoic cap or an unconformably overlying Cambrian unit, correlations based on regional seismic and well data suggest that the thick accumulation of diamictite is a well-preserved record of Neoproterozoic glaciation. We have obtained high-resolution visible and shortwave-infrared reflectance spectroscopy data from these cores with a HyLogger instrument. These data permit detailed mineralogical description of the glacial interval at a scale of ~1 cm and comprise a fully digital stratigraphic record.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude and spatial distribution of point and non-point dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs to river systems greatly influences the potential for eutrophication of downstream water bodies. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the predominant point source of N in the northeast US, remove some but not all of human waste N they receive. Excess enters rivers, which may further mitigate N concentrations by dilution and denitrification. WWTP effluent combines with upstream flows, which may include non-point sources of N due to agriculture or urbanization. Natural N removal capacities in rivers may however be overwhelmed and become N saturated, which reduces their effectiveness. As a result, natural and man-made services of N removal are intimately linked at the river network scale for provisions of suitable water quality and aquatic habitat. We assessed the summer N mitigation capacity of rivers relative to N removal in WWTPs in the northeastern U.S. using a N removal model developed within the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES). The spatially distributed river network model predicts average daily dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations at a 3-minute river grid resolution, accounting for the mixing of natural areas, nonpoint sources, WWTP effluent, and instream denitrification, which is simulated as a function of river temperature, water residence time, and biogeochemical activity. Model validation was done using N concentration data from 750 USGS gauges across the northeast during the period 2000-2010. Confidence intervals (90%) are estimated for river N concentrations based on key uncertainties in simulated river width, uptake rates, and N loading rates. Model results suggest WWTPs potentially impact 25,770 km of river length (10.7% of total river length in the northeast) and increase N concentrations an average of 42.3% at the facility locations. The in-stream ecosystem service of N removal accounts for 2.7% of the total cumulative N removed by WWTPs during the summer in the region. Despite providing a relatively small proportion of N removal, the expected deterioration of WWTP infrastructure and associated costs of upgrading existing systems puts the role of this riverine ecosystem service into economic perspective.",

            "abstract": "Positive co-variation of organic matter (OM) with iron and aluminum phases has been known for decades in soil and, in case of OM-Fe, in marine sediments. More recent studies point to the metal control on the mean residence time of organic carbon in soils, suggesting that better understanding of the role of these metal phases and the nature of these organo-metal associations would help to improve the models of soil OM dynamics. We developed a selective dissolution approach to assess these associations (Wagai and Mayer, 2007; Wagai et al., 2013). By taking advantage of well-established extraction techniques that were targeted to dissolve specific metal and aluminosilicate phases in soil, we quantified the amounts of OM co-dissolved by the selective dissolution of these inorganic phases. The inherent limitations in this conceptually simple approach include the presence of C-based compounds (often as complexing agent for metal) in the extractants and the lack of selectivity when dissolving specific inorganic phases. The former was resolved by using nitrogen (N), instead of C, as a surrogate for OM because (i) soil N is mostly present as soil OM with relatively narrow C:N ratio, and (ii) the extractants are N free. We were able to partially overcome the lack of selectivity problem by comparing the co-dissolution of OM from a variety of extractants that use reductive, complexation, and acid/alkaline dissolutions. The potential advantages of our approach include the ability (i) to estimate the contribution of specific inorganic phases to OM stabilization, and (ii) to infer the possible modes of the organo-mineral associations that were extracted from field soils (e.g., adsorptive association vs. coprecipitation of organo-metallic complexes). In this presentation, we will further consider the advantages and limitations of this approach (e.g., methodological cautions), present some of the previous and new findings gained from this approach (including its application to sediments and soil physical fractions), and discuss possible roles of the extractable inorganic phases in OM stabilization.",

            "abstract": "The Central Andes Volcanic Zone (CVZ, 14°-28°S) is one of three distinct arc segments the Nazca-South America subduction system. In comparison to the Northern and Southern segments, the CVZ contains approximately 40% of volcanoes active during the Holocene, but less than 20% of documented eruptions. It is therefore surprising that synoptic geodetic observations since 1992 have so far revealed half of the 20 known uplifting volcanoes in the Andes are in the CVZ. Furthermore, an especially high concentration of Miocene ignimbrite deposits (> 10,000 km^3) suggests that in the past large volumes of eruptible magma traversed the crust in this region. We utilize geodetic modeling to address the following questions: What are physically plausible depths, geometries, volumes, and transport mechanisms of intrusions? What are the conditions for plutonism versus volcanism in the CVZ?\nOur modeling efforts are focused on two of the spatially largest (>2,000 km^2) volcanic uplift events observed globally (Lazufre and Uturuncu). We present a synthesis of InSAR, continuous GPS, and campaign GPS (collected from a small network of sites around Lazurfre in Nov. 2011 and March 2014). New InSAR processing of Envisat ScanSAR (09/2003 - 11/2009), ALOS (02/2007 - 02/2011), and TSX (04/2008 - 07/2014) confirm continued Lazufre uplift rates of approximately 3 cm/yr. Neither TSX data (06/2012 – 07/2014), nor two continuous GPS sites on and around Uturuncu show evidence of continued 1 cm/yr vertical motion since the sites were installed in April 2010.\nAnalytic elastic models of uplift suggest intrusions accumulate in reservoirs in the mid-to-upper crust at both volcanic centers. However, peripheral subsidence at Uturuncu and observations of an extensive low velocity zone motivate the exploration of alternative realistic models that consider the influence of a feeder reservoir in the lower crust and heterogeneous crustal structure. The dual-reservoir model provides a first-order estimate of magma ascent rates, but there is a tradeoff with crustal rheology. Finite element forward models and inverse models with FEM-generated Green’s functions demonstrate that both reservoir separation distance and seismically-defined heterogeneity are significant and effect components of surface displacement disproportionately.",

For the study, daily temperature simulations with Historical (1986-2005), and RCP (2071-2090) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios are statistically downscaled to 50 peach and pear FFD (FFDpeach and FFDpear, respectively) observation sites over South Korea. The number of days transformed to standard temperature (DTS) method is selected as the phenological model and applied to simulations for estimating FFDpeach and FFDpear over South Korea, due to its superior performance on the target plants and region compared to the growing degree days (GDD) and chill days (CD) methods. In the analysis, mean temperatures for early spring (February to April) over South Korea in 2090 under RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios are expected to have increased by 1.9K and 3.3K, respectively. Among the early spring months of February to April, February shows the largest temperature increase of 2.1K and 3.7K for RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The increased temperature during February and March accelerates the plant growth rate and thereby advances FFDpeach by 7.0 and 12.7 days and FFDpear by 6.1 and 10.7 days, respectively. These results imply that the present flowering of peach and pear in the middle of April will have advanced to late March or early April by the end of this century.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out with the support of the Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development under Grant Project No. PJ009953, Republic of Korea.",

            "abstract": "Speleothem δ18O can be used as a terrestrial archive of climate variability, offering insight into rapid changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that impact terrestrial weather patterns [1]. However, separating δ18O ‘amount’, ‘source’, and ‘temperature’ effects is a challenge that requires the use of complementary rainfall proxies, such as trace element (X/Ca) ratios. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are well understood in continental caves, providing information about wet-vs-dry hydrologic conditions within the epikarst [2], the strength and timing of cave ventilation [3], and evapotranspiration above the cave in arid climates [4]. However, there are few detailed investigations of maritime caves where dripwater X/Ca ratios are impacted by seaspray [5, 6].\nHere we present results from a novel two-year automated dripwater monitoring program in a remote cave on the Island of Niue in the tropical south Pacific. High-resolution cave monitoring traditionally requires frequent site visits; monitoring this remote location required the development of new sampling strategies. The cave was instrumented for micrometeorology, dripwater δ18O and δD, and dripwater chemistry. Because of its maritime location, seaspray represents a significant contribution to karst waters. By using [Cl-] as a conservative tracer for seaspray input, we calculate that seasalt in the modern dripwater accounts for 20% of the Ca and Sr, and up to 85~95% of the Mg and Na, respectively.\nApplying seasalt corrections, we find that increased Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios correlate with enriched dripwater δ18O values, consistent with the amount effect and prior-calcite-precipitation (PCP). This short-term calibration suggests that when rainfall amount is driving speleothem chemistry in this cave, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios should strongly covary with δ18O, a result we will apply to interpretation of speleothem climate records being generated from Niue.\n[1] Lachniet, (2009) QSR 28, 412-432; [2] Tremaine and Froelich (2013) GCA 121, 522-545; [3] Wong et al.

            "abstract": "COMPASS is focused on helping scientists build the skills and relationships they need to effectively participate in public discourse. Founded in 2001 with an emphasis on ocean science, and since expanding to a broader set of environmental sciences, we have advised, coached, and/or trained thousands of researchers of all career stages. Over the years, our primary work has notably shifted from needing to persuade scientists why communication matters to supporting them as they pursue the question of what their communication goals are and how best to achieve them. Since our earliest forays into media promotion, we have evolved with the state of the science communication field. In recent years, we have adapted our approach to one that facilitates dialogue and encourages engagement, helps scientists identify the most relevant people and times to engage, tests our own assumptions, and incorporates relevant social science as possible. In this case study, we will discuss more than a decade of experience in helping scientists find or initiate and engage in meaningful conversations with journalists and policymakers.",

            "abstract": "A key limitation to further understand storm induced beach erosion and the development of simple, yet accurate predictive coastal erosion models is the paucity of field scale data collected within a short period of time of an erosion event. Here we will discuss results from a new rapid-response airborne lidar that was tested and flown to collect topographic data of the active dry beach and dune and the subsequent analysis and modeling of the erosion event. Flights were flown daily (weather permitting) pre, during, and post storm over a 6 day period to assess the temporal and spatial evolution of the upper beach during this event.\nObservations of dune erosion were compared against offshore buoy data, as well as calibrated inshore spectral wave model results to further understand the alongshore variation in beach response. Comparison of extreme runup (R2%) with the 5 daily beach surveys indicates that the most severe erosion occurred at alongshore locations where the dune toe (zdune) elevation was the lowest and where R2% > zdune during the peak of the storm.\nThree simple dune erosion models were tested on the data. The Palmsten and Holman (2012) model and a modified version of this model reproduced approximately 60% of the observed alongshore variable dune erosion during the storm. Sensitivity analysis on the impact of alongshore averaging of the topographic input data and the wave forcing as well as the effect of altering the temporal resolution of both the wave and topography updating schemes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The ISF Academy was founded by Charles Kao, a Nobel Prize laureate. In 2011, the Shuyuan programs were established at The ISF Academy to operate both as a “school within a school” and as a “school outside the classroom.” The Shuyuan programs work together with the IBO Science and Technology subject areas to develop comprehensive and challenging opportunities that address the 14 Grand Engineering Challenges. The goal is to establish co-curricular programs that go beyond the taught curriculum and support STEM curricula.\nSeveral programs outside of the classroom include an onsite robotics researcher, underwater and land based robotics programs, field trips, whole school food waste composting and the implementation of an energy tracking system. Relationships with several local universities allow students to work closely with professors in research settings and, annually, a leading researcher gives a keynote speech to our students. Other signature Shuyuan programs have developed international strategic relationships with the NRI at Cambridge University, where students spend several weeks studying science and civilization in China using primary source materials. Additionally, Shuyuan has supported extension opportunities for classroom teachers with institutional partnerships that include the British Council, governmental organizations, local universities, corporations, and NGOs.\nIn conclusion, the overall goal of the Shuyuan Programs is to provide experiential learning opportunities that challenge conventional curriculum design in a manner that is supportive and innovative!",

            "abstract": "Due to limitations of purely correlative species distribution models, there is a need for more integration of experimental approaches when studying impacts of climate change on species distributions. Here we used controlled experiments to identify physiological thresholds that control poleward range limits of three species of mangroves found in North America. We found that all three species exhibited a threshold response to extreme cold, but freeze tolerance thresholds varied among species. From these experiments we developed a climate metric, freeze degree days (FDD), which incorporates both the intensity and frequency of freezes. When included in distribution models, FDD was a better predictor of mangrove presence/absence than other temperature-based metrics. Using 27 years of satellite imagery, we linked FDD to past changes in mangrove abundance in Florida, further supporting the relevance of FDD. We then used downscaled climate projections of FDD to project poleward migration of these range limits over the next 50 years.",

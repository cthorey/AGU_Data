            "abstract": "Aura MLS atmospheric measurements have now been obtained near-globally and continuously on a daily basis for 10 years. We place some of the stratospheric composition measurements in perspective, by using merged datasets that include the Aura MLS data. Global monthly zonal mean stratospheric data records from satellite-based remote measurements were created by NASA's Global Ozone Chemistry and Related Trace gas Data Records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS) project. These data records were drawn from high quality satellite-based measurements of stratospheric composition starting in 1979 for ozone and in the early 1990s for other data records. Merged data records were obtained by combining the instrument-specific (source) data records, taking into account the mean biases between them during time periods of overlap. We briefly review the construction of GOZCARDS merged data records and provide observational results for various species (HCl, H2O, O3, N2O, HNO3). We use two model versions of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a free-running (FR-WACCM) and a \"specified dynamics\" (SD-WACCM) version, to highlight differences in the level of agreement between the models and the observations.",

            "abstract": "The upper part of the Brushy Basin Member in the Four Corners region of the U.S. was deposited in an ephemeral alkaline saline lake system with copious input of volcanic ash. The variegated shale formation provides a setting for the study of early diagenetic iron cycling that records the action of alkaline saline fluid chemistries reacting with volcaniclastic sediments in the presence of microbes. A bull’s-eye pattern of authigenic minerals with increasing alteration towards the basinal center similar to modern alkaline saline lakes provides evidence for an extreme paleoenvironmental interpretation. The purpose of this research is to document specific factors, such as reactive sediments, microbial influences, and grain size that affect concretion formation and iron cycling in an ancient extreme environment.\nThree broad diagenetic facies are interpreted by color and associated bioturbation features: red, green and intermediate. Diagenetic facies reflect meter-scale paleotopography: red facies represent shallow water to subaerial, oxidizing conditions; green facies reflect saturated conditions and reducing pore water chemistry shortly after deposition, and intermediate facies represent a combination of the previous two conditions. Evidence of biotic influence is abundant and trace fossils exhibit patterns associated with the diagenetic facies. Red diagenetic facies typically contain burrows and root traces and green diagenetic facies exhibit restricted biotic diversity typically limited to algal molds (vugs). Microbial fossils are well-preserved and are in close proximity to specific iron mineral textures suggesting biotic influence on the crystal morphology.\nThree categories of concretions are characterized based on mineralogy: carbonate, iron (oxyhydr)oxide and phosphate concretions. Concretion mineralogy and size vary within an outcrop and even within a stratigraphic horizon such that more than one main category is typically present in an outcrop. Variation in concretion mineralogy and morphology within the Brushy Basin Member suggests that alkaline saline fluid chemistries in concert with microbial interaction created diagenetic microenvironments within a larger lake system to influence iron cycling and these reactions can be spatially variable even on 10s of cm scales.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted fluctuations in the carbon isotope content (d13C) of CO2 produced by soil respiration. These fluctuations have been correlated with diel cycles of environmental forcing (e.g., soil temperature), or with synoptic weather events (e.g., rain events and pressure-induced ventilation). We used an extensive suite of observations to examine these phenomena over two months in a subalpine forest in Colorado, USA (the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site). Measurements included automated soil respiration chambers and automated measurements of the soil gas profile. We found 1) no diel change in the d13C of the soil surface flux or the CO2 produced in the soil (despite strong diel change in surface flux rate), 2) no change in d13C following wetting (despite a significant increase in soil flux rate), and 3) no evidence of pressure-induced ventilation of the soil. Measurements of the d13C of surface CO2 flux agreed closely with the isotopic composition of soil CO2 production calculated using soil profile measurements. Temporal variation in the d13C of surface flux was relatively minor and unrelated to measured environmental variables. Deep in the soil profile, results conform to established theory regarding diffusive soil gas transport and isotopic fractionation, and suggest that sampling soil gas at a depth of several tens of centimeters is a simple and effective way to assess the mean d13C of the surface flux.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests Archean Earth had a photochemical hydrocarbon haze similar to Titan's (Zerkle et al. 2012), with important climate implications (Pavlov et al. 2001, Trainer et al. 2006, Haqq-Misra et al. 2008, Domagal-Goldman et al. 2008, Wolf and Toon 2012). Observations also suggest hazy exoplanets are common (Sing et al. 2011, Kreidberg et al 2014), so hazy planet spectra will be relevant to future exoplanet spectral characterization missions. Here, we consider the implications of hydrocarbon aerosols on the spectrum of Archean Earth, examining the effect of a haze layer on the detectability of spectral features from putative biosignatures and the Rayleigh scattering slope. We also examine haze's impact on the spectral energy distribution at the planetary surface, which may be important to the co-evolution of life with its environment. Because the atmospheric pressure and haze particle composition of the Archean Earth are poorly constrained, we test the impact of atmospheric pressure and particle density on haze formation. Our study uses a modified version of the 1-D photochemical code developed originally by Kasting et al. (1979) to generate a fractal haze in the model Archean atmosphere. The 1-D line-by-line fully multiple scattering Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (SMART) (Meadows and Crisp 1996) is then used to generate synthetic spectra of early Earth with haze. We find (Fig 1) that haze scattering significantly depletes the radiation at short wavelengths, strongly affecting the spectral region of the Rayleigh slope, a broadband change in spectral shape detectable at low spectral resolution. At the surface, the spectral energy distribution is shifted towards longer wavelengths, which may be important to photosynthetic life. Thus, the haze may have significant effects on biology, which in turn produces the methane that leads to haze formation, creating feedback loops between biology and the planet.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization of ultramafic rocks, during which olivine and pyroxene minerals are replaced by serpentine, magnetite, brucite and talc, is associated with hydrothermal activity at slow and ultraslow mid-ocean ridges. Serpentinization reactions affect hydrothermal fluid circulation by changing permeability of the oceanic crust. To advance our understanding of the evolution of permeability accompanying serpentinization reactions, we performed a series of flow-through experiments at a temperature of 260˚C, a confining pressure of 50 MPa, and a pore pressure of 20±2 MPa on cylindrical cores of ultramafic rocks (18 mm in diameter and 23 mm length) containing a single through-going tensile fracture. Pore fluid flow was in one direction and was collected routinely for chemical analysis. A 7.5 mm thick layer of the same rock, crushed and sieved (0.18-1.0 mm) was placed on the inlet end of the sample to produce a reactive heated reservoir for the pore fluid before entering the fracture. Multiple peridotite samples were tested, to investigate the effect of mineral assemblage on fluid-rock interaction and permeability.\nThe initial effective permeability of the samples varied between 10-(15-18)m2, and it decreased by about 2 orders of magnitude in 7-10 days, showing that serpentinization reactions result in an initially rapid decrease in permeability. The best fit equation for the observed rate of change in permeability (k) is in the form of dk/dt=Ae-0.01t, where A is a constant and t is time. This result suggests that the rate of serpentine formation is largely controlled by the initial permeability rather than the properties of the reacting rock. Assuming flow between parallel plates, we find the effective crack width decreases by approximately 2 orders of magnitude during the experiments. The fluid chemistry and mineralogy data support the occurrence of serpentinization reactions. The early peak and monotonic decrease in the concentration of Mg, and Si in pore fluid collected from all samples is consistent with an initial phase of rapid Mg-silicate dissolution followed by a declining rate as precipitation coated reactive surfaces. EMP analysis and SEM imaging show precipitation of serpentine phases along the walls of the tensile fracture, which is the main factor contributing to the reduction in permeability.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary sequences of the Marwar Supergroup (NW India) are divided into lowermost Jodhpur Group, middle Bilara Group and uppermost Nagaur Group. Age constraints (based on fossils, detrital zircon and stable isotopic studies) indicate an early Cambrian age for the uppermost Nagaur Group. Although not well-constrained, the Edicaran-Cambrian boundary is placed within the Nagaur Group. The basal Marwar sedimentary units (the Sonia and Girbakhar sandstones) rest unconformably over the ~750 Ma Malani rhyolites and contain enigmatic discoidal fossils. The age for the onset of sedimentation within the lowermost Jodhpur Group remains elusive. In this study we reported new LA-ICP-MS ages from a felsic igneous rock layer within the Jodhpur Group (Sonia sandstone) at Khatu. Cathodoluminescence images showed the zircons from the felsic rock are rounded and fragmentary consistent with an inherited or xenocrystic origin. The age spectra from the zircons are dominated by peaks of around 850 Ma, 1200~1400 Ma, 1500~2000 Ma, 2500 Ma consistent with previous studies. A youngest concordant zircon yielded an age 702 Ma ± 17.2. As the ages in our study are from recycled/inherited ancient grains, the exact crystallization age remains elusive. Nevertheless, the eruption of the felsic rocks must be no older than ~700 Ma. Additional studies are underway to constrain the age of the lowermost Marwar Supergroup and to place the basinal development in a tectonic context.",

            "abstract": "Submarine fans are complex sea-floor landforms built over a variety of time and space scales from turbulent instability on the low end up to basin-scale filling on the upper end. The intervening intermediate scale is often a source of eventual lithologic heterogeneity as many depositional lobes are built through time and space as building blocks for the larger landform. Here we take an experimental approach toward investigating submarine fan evolution and the preserved architecture by addressing the question: What is the relationship between the formative hydraulics and preserved sedimentary product of intermediate-scale, i.e., avulsion-scale, features? Experiments offer the ability to dictate boundary conditions as well as monitor the evolution of the flow field, here through image-based particle tracking techniques, and of the sediment bed. Our experimental approach consists of using saline density currents with crushed melamine plastic sediment to build submarine fans with supercritical distributaries. These fan systems experience avulsion cycles characterized by: (1) channel incision and basinward extension, (2) channel stagnation and lobe aggradation, (3) hydraulic jump formation upstream of the lobe that then retreats updip, and (4) flow avulsion. Hydraulic jump formation is an important part of these cycles in that the jump region becomes a significant locus of deposition. We found there exists a relationship between the upstream hydraulic properties, namely the denismetric Froude number, and depositional lobe thickness. This occurs because of consistent relationships between Froude number and the sequent depth ratio. This also leads to other relationships in the planform that can be tied to hydraulic variables. In this way there exists the potential to invert upstream hydraulic data from preserved depositional features created within avulsion cycles.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the potential economic and physical impacts of climate change on coastal resources involves evaluating a number of distinct adaptive responses. This paper presents a tool for such analysis, a spatially-disaggregated optimization model for adaptation to sea level rise (SLR) and storm surge, the Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM). This decision-making framework fills a gap between very detailed studies of specific locations and overly aggregate global analyses. While CIAM is global in scope, the optimal adaptation strategy is determined at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments as described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al. 2006). The decision to pursue a given adaptation measure depends on local socioeconomic factors like income, population, and land values and how they develop over time, relative to the magnitude of potential coastal impacts, based on geophysical attributes like inundation zones and storm surge. For example, the model's decision to protect or retreat considers the costs of constructing and maintaining coastal defenses versus those of relocating people and capital to minimize damages from land inundation and coastal storms. Uncertain storm surge events are modeled with a generalized extreme value distribution calibrated to data on local surge extremes. Adaptation is optimized for the near-term outlook, in an “act then learn then act” framework that is repeated over the model time horizon. This framework allows the adaptation strategy to be flexibly updated, reflecting the process of iterative risk management. CIAM provides new estimates of the economic costs of SLR; moreover, these detailed results can be compactly represented in a set of adaptation and damage functions for use in integrated assessment models. Alongside the optimal result, CIAM evaluates suboptimal cases and finds that global costs could increase by an order of magnitude, illustrating the importance of adaptive capacity and coastal policy.",

Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) are the growing climate induced hazards in the Himalaya increasing the vulnerability of community living in the mountain valley, and the fragile ecosystem. This study tried to come up with the potential impacts from glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in highland of eastern region of Nepal and potential role of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in coping. I analyzed the trend of climatic pattern (temperature and precipitation) of the Eastern Himalaya Region of Nepal available from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, and also prepared the latest location map of the glacial lakes using google earth and ArcGIS application in the highland of the Kanchanjungha Conservation Area of the region. Tiptala glacial lake, located at an elevation of 4950 masl, within the conservation area, was selected for the GLOF hazard assessment. I used semi-structured questioner survey and key informants interviews in the community living below the lake in the highland of the study area in order to assess the potential hazard of GLOF. Analysis shows the increasing trend of atmospheric temperature in the region. With the varying sizes, 46 glacial lakes were located in the region, which covers over 2.57 sq. km in total. Though the larger portion of the downstream area of the Tiptala glacial lake fall in the remote location away from major residential area, few villages, major pasture lands for Yaks, foot trails, and several bridges across the Tamor River below the lake are in risk of GLOF. Poor access due to extreme geographical remoteness and capacity to afford the modern technologies in the community is seen as the major limiting factor to the knowledge and information about the climate change and related impacts. Modern ICTs has high potential to reduce the risk of climate related hazards in the remote area by information dissemination and awareness.",

Close monitoring is needed to save such vital components of our environment. Remote-sensing technology has shown its ability to monitor and survey remote areas of coral reefs. In this study, coral reef habitats in Hurghada, Egypt were examined using Landsat imageries over a 26-year period. The change detection analysis was adopted to identify the alterations in coral reef habitats between 1987 and 2013. Three images, acquired from Landsat-5 TM on August 14th 1987, Landsat-7 ETM+ on September 10th 2000, and Landsat-8 OLI on July 20th 2013, were used in the change detection analysis. Different processing techniques were applied to the three images, including but not limited to rectification, masking, water column correction, classification, and change detection statistics. The supervised classifications performed over the three scenes show five significant marine-related classes: coral, sand subtidal, sand intertidal, macro-algae, and seagrass. The change detection statistics obtained from the classified scenes of 1987 and 2000 revealed a significant increase in the macro-algae and seagrass classes (93% and 47%, respectively), accompanied by a major decline in the sand intertidal, coral, and sand subtidal classes (41%, 40%, and 37%, respectively). On the other hand, the change detection statistics obtained from the classified scenes of 2000 and 2013 revealed an increase in the sand subtidal and macro-algae classes (14% and 19%, respectively), while a major decrease in the sand intertidal, coral, and seagrass classes (49%, 46% and 74%, respectively).",

            "abstract": "We apply an integrated modeling framework to both target and value watershed management interventions in the Upper Tana watershed, which provides municipal water, irrigation water, and hydropower services to Nairobi and surrounding areas. The analysis begins by applying an index model approach that incorporates existing land use and land surface characteristics to prioritize the type and location of conservation investments in different subbasins, subject to budget constraints and stakeholder concerns (Resource Investment Optimization System -- RIOS). We then run the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using the RIOS-identified investment scenarios to produce spatially explicit scenarios that simulate changes in water yield and suspended sediment. Finally, we link those biophysical outputs to monetary and non-monetary human well-being metrics for multiple benefit streams, including: Reduced water treatment costs, increased hydropower production, and crop yield benefits for upstream farmers in the conservation area. The viability of a payment for watershed services scheme is discussed, with attention to the various components of value assessed and to dependencies on water management approaches. While other studies have examined links between land use and the provision of hydrologic services, this study is novel in that it presents an integrated analysis that targets interventions in a decision context and then relies on calibrated, process-based, biophysical models to demonstrate the return on those investments considering multiple (and sometimes competing) hydrological services, doing so at a sub-annual time-scale.",

            "abstract": "Snowpack is crucial for the western USA, providing around 75% of the total fresh water supply (Cayan et al., 1996) and buffering against seasonal aridity impacts on agricultural, ecosystem, and urban water demands. The resilience of the California water system is largely dependent on natural stores provided by snowpack. This resilience has shown vulnerabilities due to anthropogenic global climate change. Historically, the northern Sierras showed a net decline of 50-75% in snow water equivalent (SWE) while the southern Sierras showed a net accumulation of 30% (Mote et al., 2005). Future trends of SWE highlight that western USA SWE may decline by 40-70% (Pierce and Cayan, 2013), snowfall may decrease by 25-40% (Pierce and Cayan, 2013), and more winter storms may tend towards rain rather than snow (Bales et al., 2006). The volatility of Sierran snowpack presents a need for scientific tools to help water managers and policy makers assess current and future trends. A burgeoning tool to analyze these trends comes in the form of variable-resolution global climate modeling (VRGCM). VRGCMs serve as a bridge between regional and global models and provide added resolution in areas of need, eliminate lateral boundary forcings, provide model runtime speed up, and utilize a common dynamical core, physics scheme and sub-grid scale parameterization package. A cubed-sphere variable-resolution grid with 25 km horizontal resolution over the western USA was developed for use in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) within the Community Earth System Model (CESM). A 25-year three-member ensemble climatology (1980-2005) is presented and major snowpack metrics such as SWE, snow depth, snow cover, and two-meter surface temperature are assessed. The ensemble simulation is also compared to observational, reanalysis, and WRF model datasets. The variable-resolution model provides a mechanism for reaching towards non-hydrostatic scales and simulations are currently being developed with refined nests of 12.5km resolution over California.",

However, the data considered to represent the “true” values often include their own measurement errors, biasing calibration and validation results. Triple collocation (TC) can be used to estimate the root-mean-square-error (RMSE), using observations from three mutually-independent, error-prone measurement systems. Here, we introduce Extended Triple Collocation (ETC): using exactly the same assumptions as TC, we derive an additional performance metric, the correlation coefficient of the measurement system with respect to the unknown target, R2. We demonstrate that R2 is the scaled, unbiased signal-to-noise ratio, and provides a complementary perspective compared to the RMSE. We apply it to three collocated wind datasets: the ECMWF numerical weather prediction forecast, ASCAT scatterometer retrievals and in-situ buoy measurements. Since ETC is as easy to implement as TC, requires no additional assumptions, and provides an extra performance metric, it may be of interest in a wide range of geophysical disciplines.",

            "abstract": "The generation of surface-bound exospheres present around the Moon, Mercury and other airless rocky bodies are produced primarily by the interaction of micrometeoroid impacts and charged particles from the solar wind, and magnetospheres with those surfaces. While the study of the interactions of both micrometeoroids and ion sputtering are well investigated, the contributions arising from energetic electron interactions are typically less-well established. Observations from the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS), taken < 400 km from the surface, have shown a plasma cusp with energetic heavy ions (i.e. Na+- and O+-groups) for which the source has not been determined. However, the precipitation of keV electrons onto the surfaces of Mercury has recently been inferred from measurements using the X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) instrument onboard the MESSENGER spacecraft observations of the night-side of Mercury. A newly developed global kinetic transport model suggests that electron-stimulated desorption (ESD), and possibly light ion stimulated desorption (ISD), can directly yield ions that can be transported and dynamically accelerated to the plasma cusp regions observed by FIPS. In addition, keV electrons and ions from the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere frequently bombard with the lunar surface. Here, we present some of the most recent results from our ongoing work studying the effects of photon-stimulated desorption (PSD), ion-stimulated desorption (ISD) and implantation, as well as electron-stimulated desorption (ESD). Apollo samples collected from both the lunar highland and Mare regions, as well as simulants of the Mercury Regolith have been investigated. The temperature- (100-600 K) and energy-dependence (threshold – 2 keV) of ESD time-of-flight (ToF) results will be presented for these materials along with some preliminary results from our group based on photon-desorption studies of water on lunar material, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies of water covered regolith and dusts, as well as the effects of ion implantation/sputtering using keV H+ ions on ESD-ToF results. The implications of these results in the context of current observations will be discussed.",

(2009, JGR 114) analyzed surface radiation data spanning 1995 through 2007 from several ARM and six SURFRAD sites across the continental US, and showed an average 8 Wm-2/decade brightening in all-sky downwelling SW. The study also showed a 5 Wm-2/decade increase in the clear-sky downwelling SW, an expected result of decreasing aerosol optical depths during the same time period (Augustine et al., 2008, JGR 113). However, the unexpected result of the Long et al. study is that the 5 Wm-2/decade increase is in the diffuse SW, while the direct SW remained virtually unchanged...opposite what is expected for aerosol direct effect due to decreases in aerosols. With detailed radiative transfer modeling and correlation with US FAA commercial flight hours through the same years, Long et al. speculated that while the decreased aerosols did increase the total SW, an increase in high, sub-visual contrail-generated ice haze repartitioned the increase into the diffuse SW component through large-mode scattering.\nSubsequent attempts to investigate the veracity of this speculation using long time series of ARM Micropulse and Raman lidar data proved untenable due to instrument limitation and continuity issues. However, similar to using the red/blue ratio of pixel color amounts in processing color sky images to infer clouds, we have used clear-sky diffuse SW irradiance measurements from the Multi-Frequency Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) 870 and 415 nm spectral channels to look at any possible trends suggesting \"whitening\" of the cloud-free skies over the ARM SGP site. We will present our preliminary findings to date of these investigations suggesting indeed that there has been an aggregate \"whitening\" of the sky conditions we typically consider to be \"cloud free.\"\nAugustine, J.A., G.B.Hodges, E.G.Dutton, J.J.

Spatial variations in the tidal loading response allow us to constrain absolute ranges of density and the two elastic moduli through the regional crust and upper mantle. We process 30-second GPS data using the GIPSY-OASIS II software to obtain position estimates every 5-minutes, with special attention paid to removing tropospheric delay effects. We then extract tidal loading response signals from multiple years of processed GPS time series using generalized harmonic analysis techniques, whereby satellite modulation corrections and the astronomical argument are updated at each epoch. To compare with our observations, we construct a range of forward models by convolving modern ocean tidal loading models (e.g., FES2012, TPX08-Atlas) with Greens functions for Earth structure. The development of our own load Love number and Greens function computation code provides us with the facility to explore a wide range of 1D, layered elastic Earth models. Finally, we convert our forward modeling methods into a Bayesian inversion framework to explore the range of density and elastic structural models for the Amazonian Craton that are consistent with our observations.",

Regular monitoring of Jupiter and solar radio storms is typical, and Radio Jove amateur observations have improved in their scientific utility. Some observers have upgraded their equipment to make spectroscopic observations in the frequency band from 15-30 MHz. These observations can be particularly useful when made in conjunction with professional telescopes such as the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), the Nancay Decametric Array, the Ukrainian UTR-2 Radio Telescope, etc. The coming Juno mission to Jupiter will observe the radio emissions while in orbit at Jupiter and will benefit from the Earth-based perspective provided by frequent monitoring of the emissions. With these goals in mind work is now underway to provide simple methods of archiving the Radio Jove observations for use by the amateur and professional radio science community in scientifically useful and easily analyzed formats. The data will be ingested to both Radio Jove specific databases and to archives containing a variety of “waves” data.

            "abstract": "For the first time, the Rosetta spacecraft stays with a comet over an extended period of time during its journey in the inner the solar system. The data provided by the suite of instruments on board the Rosetta spacecraft, notably the ROSINA mass spectrometers and the pressure sensor, provides critical information concerning comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) and its environment. These measurements reinforce our knowledge of comet CG and enable us to describe the nucleus and the sources with more details. The observations allow us to better constrain and accordingly develop much more realistic models of the comet’s coma.\nWe show a 3D simulation of the gas and dust coma of comet CG using a Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo model performed with the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (Tenishev et al. 2008, 2011). The coma model presented includes a realistic nucleus shape, with a gas flux distribution and a surface temperature that takes into account irregularities and concavities of the nucleus. Along with the gas drag, the gravity field drives the dust dynamics and is therefore accurately computed around the irregular nucleus shape. This constitutes the state-of-the-art of cometary coma models, which are crucial to interpret instrument data and for further mission planning.\nAcknowledgement:\nThis work was supported by contracts JPL#1266313 and JPL#1266314 from the US Rosetta Project and NASA grant NNX09AB59G from the Planetary Atmospheres Program.\n",

            "abstract": "Whereas glaciated landscapes record increased erosional efficiency through moraines and U-shaped valleys, unglaciated hillslopes and rivers lack a mechanistic theory for climate controls on their dynamics and form. Changes in precipitation and associated aggradation due to vegetation loss or incision due to increased river discharge are commonly invoked when considering the effect of glacial intervals on unglaciated terrains, but there is scant evidence supporting or discounting these hypotheses. Surprisingly, there is little consideration that temperature, rather than precipitation, may dictate the frequency, magnitude, or style of erosion in unglaciated landscapes during glacial intervals. Here, we present results combining a mechanistic frost-cracking model with downscaled general circulation model output to predict the extent and intensity of sediment production via frost processes across the unglaciated Oregon Coast Range (OCR) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our results show that in this mid-latitude region, well south of the Cordilleran ice sheet, frost-driven processes likely shaped 90% of the present-day landmass during the LGM. A suite of geomorphic and vegetation data from a 50-ky sediment core from a paleo landslide-dammed lake in the OCR support our model results. Our study site, Little Lake, is located in the central portion of the OCR, over 400 m south of the maximum extent of the Cordilleran ice sheet. Based on 10Be-derived erosion rates, present-day catchment erosion rates average 0.07 ± 0.03 mm/yr (mean ± sd), while LGM erosion rates remained constant around 0.19 ± 0.01 mm/yr. These LGM values are nearly 3X greater than present-day erosion rates and coincide with high frost cracking intensity predicted by our model. We also observe a transition from finely laminated lacustrine clays and sands to coarse lacustrine blue-grey sands at ~ 28 ka, during the transition to the LGM. The presence of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir) in the core during the LGM imply mean annual temperatures of ~ 1 °C and January mean temperatures of ~ -7 °C. Our results suggest that broad swaths of continental landscapes likely experienced accelerated sediment production via frost processes rather than via changes in precipitation during glacial intervals.",

            "abstract": "The CHUVA project (Cloud processes of tHe main precipitation systems in Brazil: A contribUtion to cloud resolVing modeling and to the GPM (GlobAl Precipitation Measurement)) is a Brazillian experiment that aims to understand the several cloud processes that occur in different precipitating regimes. At present, the CHUVA project has conducted 6 field campaigns, the last one being in Manaus jointly with GoAmazon, IARA and ACRIDICON. The main focus of the present study is to bring into perspective the different characteristics of precipitation that reaches the surface in Brazil over several locations. To do so, disdrometer data is analyzed in detail, employing a Gamma fit for each DSD measurement which provides the respective parameters to be studied. Those are disposed in a 3D space, each axis corresponding to one parameter, and the patterns are analyzed. A correlation between the Gamma parameters is defined as a parametric surface that fits the observations with errors smaller than 10% and R2 greater than 0.95. In this way, one parameter can be estimated with respect to the other two, reducing the degrees of freedom of the problem from 3 to 2. As the 3 parameters are defined over this surface, it’s possible to obtain a surface representing integral DSD properties such as rainfall intensity (RI). Sensibilities tests are conducted on this estimation and also on other DSD characteristics such as total droplet concentrations and mean mass-weighted diameter. It’s shown that the DSD integral properties are generally very sensitive to the Gamma parameters. Nonetheless, the sensibility varies over the surface, being higher in a region where the parameters are not balanced (i.e. a relatively high value in one parameter and low values on the other two). It’s suggested that any study proposing parameterization/estimation of DSD properties should be aware of this region of high sensitivity. To further the collaboration with GoAmazon and ACRIDICON, the disdrometer results regarding rainfall droplets are compared against in-situ cloud DSDs. The same 3D pattern recognition on the parameters is conducted and discussed, highlighting the effects of aerosol particles on the DSD characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this experiment is to decide whether or not the sediment located within Searsville Dam at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is well suited for agricultural soil. By utilizing various combinations of sediment, farm soil, compost, and horse manure to grow basil plants, we underwent an exploratory study in order to better understand what type of materials and nutrients plants can best thrive within. Our general experiment protocol includes watering the crops with irrigation every day while young, and then limiting that water exposure to only Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays as they become more established. The basil is growing in pots filled with the different amounts of material, and are arranged randomly to prevent certain plants from getting more sunlight than others. The whole experiment plot is covered with a thin white fabric and secured with bricks and wood to keep out pests in the garden. In order to observe trends in the basil development, plant height and leaf number is recorded once every week. During the third week of the study we performed soil texture tests, and within the fourth week we calculated pH data. We discovered that the sediment our project focuses upon is 10-18% clay and 50% sand which categorizes it as loam, and the Stanford farm soil that serves as our control group contains 20-26% clay and 30% sand so it is a silt loam material. The pH tests also showed an average of 7.45 for sediment, 7.3 for farm soil, 7.85 for compost, and 7.65 for horse manure. By looking at all of the data recorded over the five-week time period, we have so far noticed that the 50% sediment and 50% horse manure combination consistently has the best height increase as well as leaf size and content. The 50% sediment and 50% compost mixture has also performed well in those terms, and is therefore a possibility for the best agricultural soil. However, future lab work conducted by Stanford students to examine the nutrient content of the basil tissue, along with the study of other types of plants in each agricultural medium, will be the determining factors when deciding whether or not the sediment from Searsville Dam is the ideal substance for growing crops, especially when mixed with other fertile substances.",

            "abstract": "Detailed process-oriented study of the mechanisms of conversion in the Arctic of fossil carbon to atmospheric gas is progressing, but necessarily limited to a few point locations and requiring detailed subsurface measurements inaccessible to remote sensing. Airborne measurements of concentration, transport and flux of these carbon gases at sufficiently low altitude to reflect surface variations can tie such local measurements to remotely observable features of the landscape. Carbon dioxide and water vapor have been observable for over 20 years from low-altitude small aircraft in the Arctic and elsewhere. Methane has been more difficult, requiring large powerful aircraft or limited flask samples. Recent developments in spectroscopy, however, have reduced the power and weight required to measure methane at rates suitable for eddy-covariance flux estimates. The Flux Observations of Carbon from an Airborne Laboratory (FOCAL) takes advantage of Integrated Cavity-Output Spectroscopy (ICOS) to measure CH4, CO2, and water vapor in a new airborne system. The system, moreover, measures these gases' stable isotopologues every two seconds or faster helping to separate thermogenic from biogenic emissions. Paired with the Best Airborne Turbulence (BAT) probe developed for small aircraft by NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory and a light twin-engine aircraft adapted by Aurora Flight Sciences Inc., the FOCAL measures at 6 m spacing, covering 100 km in less than 30 minutes. It flies between 10 m and 50 m above ground interspersed with profiles to the top of the boundary layer and beyond.\nThis presentation gives an overview of the magnitude and variation in fluxes and concentrations of CH4, CO2, and H2O with space, time, and time of day in a spatially extensive survey, more than 7500 km total in 15 flights over roughly a 100 km square during the month of August 2013. An extensive data set such as this at low altitude with high-rate sampling addresses features that repeat on 1 km scale or smaller such as thermokarst lakes as well as landscape changes on the 100 km scale.",

            "abstract": "We examine a multi-centennial Balkan record of vegetation and landscape during the Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic transition that lasted from c. 15th to the 19th century AD. Biological proxies (pollen, spores, and charcoal), geochemical analysis (X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)), and a robust chronology based on AMS 14C dating are used to reconstruct the vegetation response and human-environmental interactions during the LIA. A sediment core extracted from a sinkhole lake located in western Serbia (44°30’N-19°30’E; elevation 250 m a.s.l.) was sampled at 10-cm intervals for investigating biological proxies. Palynological data include temperate indigenous trees (e.g. Quercus, Betula), herbaceous taxa (e.g. Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae), and key anthropogenic indicators (e.g. Juglans, cereals) and demonstrate wet and cool conditions as well as seasonal variations during cal. 16th to 19th century AD. The XRF data obtained from the core at 1-cm intervals show changes in the clastic input and surface erosion around the lake probably owing to seasonal variations during the LIA. Moreover, pollen and charcoal data together reveal the changing nature of human interference across the LIA from intense deforestation to reforestation and sustained cultivation with climatic and seasonal variations. Correlating palaeoecological and geochemical data for this region allows us to interpret the long-term dynamics of landscape and humans across one of the important climatic intervals in Europe. The Balkans, as one of Europe’s “Biodiversity Hotspots” and a rapidly changing region, provides insights into possible biotic responses to future global climatic change.",

In order to not favor any one particular reanalysis, an ensemble mean of the four most recent reanalyses [CFSR, MERRA, ERA-Interim, and the JRA55] has been created. Differences from this ensemble mean indicate how these four reanalyses and previous reanalyses differ in their long term climatology and time evolution of their dynamic variables at both poles and in the tropics. Differences from the ensemble mean indicate issues with how the analysis systems managed data poor time periods, consequences of bias correction, the transition from the SSU to AMSU observing systems, and differences in the annual amplitudes.

            "abstract": "Analyses of emerged Quaternary paleo-shorelines and marine deposits aid in the reconstruction of environmental conditions and variability surrounding recent ice volume and sea-level histories derived from oxygen isotope records. We present preliminary results from a project designed to analyze the age, elevation, and paleoclimate history of Quaternary sediments deposited during sea level highstands along the United States Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) from Maryland to Florida. Prior studies have shown that, depending on the region, ACP sediments correlate with past interglacial periods corresponding to Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5, 7, possibly 9, and 11. Stratigraphy, marine micropaleontology, and palynology indicate at least two major marine transgressive sequences on the Delmarva Peninsula in Virginia corresponding to MIS 5a and 11, the Nassawadox Formation and Accomack beds of the Omar Formation, respectively. These depositional sequences represent sea-level positions of approximately +10m and +15m, relative to today. Despite generally corresponding to glacio-eustatic sea levels of +5-9m for MIS 5a-e (Potter & Lambeck, 2003; Kopp et al., 2009), and of +6-13m for MIS 11 (Raymo & Mitrovica, 2012), the relative sea-level positions during both interglacial periods were likely affected by glacio-isostatic adjustment in the region. Corresponding marine units and paleo-shorelines, identified by pronounced inland scarps separated by intermittent terraces on the western side of the Chesapeake Bay, are likely from MIS 5, 7, and 11. Ostracode and foraminifera assemblages identify significant environmental variability within these transgressive interglacial deposits, likely driven by relatively minor, suborbital climatic and sea-level oscillations.",

            "abstract": "Knowing the magnitude of tectonic stress and rock strength at seismically active margins is important towards understanding fault strength and failure mechanics, yet both are difficult to measure in situ. Recent work at subduction margins, including Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Subduction Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) drillsites, uses the width of compressional wellbore breakouts (BO), which depends on far field stress conditions, rock strength, and borehole annular pressure (APRS), to estimate the magnitude of horizontal principal stresses (SHmax and Shmin); estimates are problematic due to uncertainty in rock strength (unconfined compressive strength/UCS– for which direct measurements are scarce) and rheology that govern stress distribution at the wellbore. We conduct a novel case study at IODP Site C0002, where a hole was drilled twice with different boundary conditions, providing an opportunity to define in situ stress and strength from field data.\nSite C0002 is the main deep riser borehole for NanTroSEIZE, located near the seaward edge of the Kumano Basin above the seismogenic plate boundary, ~30 km from the trench. Several boreholes were drilled at the site. During IODP Expedition 314 in 2007, Hole C0002A was drilled with a suite of logging while drilling (LWD) tools to 1401 mbsf in a riserless mode. Hole C0002F, ~70 m away, was drilled to 862 mbsf in riserless mode during Exp. 326 in 2010 and deepened to 2005 mbsf in a riser mode during Expedition 338 in 2012-2013. Increased APRS achieved by riser drilling stabilizes the borehole and suppresses BO, consistent with resistivity imaging data from Exp. 314 that document well-developed, continuous BO throughout the borehole, and data from Expedition 338 indicating few BO.\nWe use a semi-Newtonian approach to solve for stress and UCS consistent with the observed BO width and measured APRS in the two holes over the interval from 862-2005 mbsf. Effective SHmax ranges from ~10-30 MPa and indicate a strike-slip or thrust regime. Our results indicate UCS is higher than predicted by empirical relations and a small suite of laboratory tests by as much as 20 MPa. This apparent discrepancy may indicate that the failure criterion, or assumed distribution of stresses around the wellbore in analyses of far field stress, may not be appropriate in this setting.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) availability varies considerably throughout Taylor Valley, Antarctica. As an essential nutrient, P content and weathering have significant implications for the diversity and functioning of biota in soils, streams, and lakes. In upper Taylor Valley (Bonney Basin), soils have much lower total P content than in lower Taylor Valley (Fryxell Basin), 0.4 versus 1.5 g/kg soil. We hypothesize that this striking contrast is related to differences in glacial drift source and weathering rates.\nWe investigated the primary source of mineral P (apatite) and the grain-scale weathering processes resulting in the release of P into streams and adjacent soils in the Bonney and Fryxell Basins. Physical erosion, chemical weathering, and biological weathering all leave distinctive patterns on the surface of individual apatite grains. By inspecting these surfaces, we determined the relative importance of weathering processes for P cycling.\nApatite grains were separated from loose glacial drift using heavy-liquid and magnetic techniques. Individual grains were analyzed using SEM-EDS. We observe significant differences between the grains collected from the two basins. Grains from the Bonney Basin are more elongated and have a higher proportion of crystal faces. These results suggest that rates of physical weathering have been lower in the Bonney Basin than in the Fryxell Basin. In addition, we will present results on grain surface morphologies, indicative of chemical and biological weathering.\nAs the climate warms, more liquid water is expected to be available within the Taylor Valley system. This increase in water will likely lead to higher rates of P weathering, potentially altering nutrient limitation in this environment. Understanding how the P cycle will respond to a changing climate is contingent on understanding the current weathering processes and controls on P availability.",

Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem. Satellite, airborne, and field data are used to evaluate the suitability of HyspIRI’s spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage for capturing variability in giant kelp photosynthetic pigment state. Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the photosynthetic condition of giant kelp canopy (i.e. pigment and nutrient concentrations) are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We then compare pigment and nutrient concentrations of kelp fronds to laboratory and airborne measurements of reflectance and transmittance in order to develop spectral metrics of kelp photosynthetic pigment state.\nWe developed spectral indices that explained 71%, 18%, and 59% of the variance for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, and fucoxanthin respectively, and found that HyspIRI will have sufficient spectral resolution and signal to detect these changes in chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin. Our results indicate that the spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and variability in photosynthetic condition of giant kelp.",

            "abstract": "Supereruptions have the potential to be devastating events, and constraining the longevity of the giant pools of magma (>450 km3) discharged in such eruptions is critical. Much work has focused on this problem, but no consensus has been reached, and estimates vary considerably depending on the approach used (e.g. Bishop Tuff, zircon geochronology: 103-106 a; oxygen isotopes: 104 a; thermal modeling: 103-105 a; textures, diffusion chronometry: 103 a). This discrepancy exists partly because different timekeepers in eruptive products record different magmatic processes, and methods vary in how well they can resolve timescales related to these processes. We describe a new method using textures (sizes, shapes, positions) of quartz-hosted melt inclusions, determined from propagation phase-contrast x-ray tomography, to estimate crystallization times. The premise of this geochronometer is that, over time, initially round melt inclusions become more faceted through diffusion, and their current shape can be used to estimate their magmatic residence time. This method is distinct in that it illuminates the time that a magma was melt-rich and eruptible rather than crystal-rich and uneruptible; many geochronometers can record these latter, more protracted histories, making it challenging to interpret the timescales that result from them. We also use this method to estimate quartz growth rates, an important but currently poorly constrained quantity. We determine growth rates by relating inclusion residence times and their positions within a crystal: Growth Rate = Length (distance from crystal edge) / Time (residence time). We apply this method to three large-volume high-silica rhyolite eruptions: the paired 240 ka Ohakuri-Mamaku (245 km3 combined volume; central Taupo Volcanic Zone [TVZ], New Zealand), the 26.5 ka Oruanui (530 km3; central TVZ), and the 760 ka Bishop Tuff (1000 km3; California, USA). To validate this method, we compare a subset of our results to those obtained from Ti diffusion profiles in the same crystals. Results show that: (a) the two methods give comparable timescale estimates; (b) quartz growth rates average 10-12 m/s; and (c) quartz melt inclusions give decadal to centennial timescales, revealing that giant magma bodies develop over notably short, historical timescales.",

            "abstract": "Science communication does not have to be a solitary practice. And yet, many scientists go about it alone and with little support from their peers and organizations. To strengthen community and build support for science communicators, NASA designed a training course aimed at two goals: 1) to develop individual scientists’ communication skills, and 2) to begin to build a science communication culture at the agency. NASA offered a pilot version of this training course in 2014: the agency’s first multidisciplinary face-to-face learning experience for science communicators. Twenty-six Earth, space and life scientists from ten field centers came together for three days of learning. They took part in fundamental skill-building exercises, individual development planning, and high-impact team projects. This presentation will describe the course design and learning objectives, the experience of the participants, and the evaluation results that will inform future offerings of communication training for NASA scientists and others.",

            "abstract": "The Western United States relies heavily on forested mountain watersheds for its water supply. These same watersheds are nearly uniformly managed using fire suppression, which has persisted over the past century. The dense vegetation resulting from fire suppression has the potential to increase the risk of catastrophic fires, damage ecosystems, and reduce water yield from these watersheds. Despite the ubiquity of fire suppression, the hydrologic effects of restoring the pre-European fire regime in forested watersheds are unknown, as the vast majority of water-fire studies focus on severe, infrequent events. The Illilouette Creek Basin, within Yosemite National Park, has been allowed to revert to a natural fire regime over the last forty years. The results presented here form part of the first hydrological analysis of the effects of restoring a natural fire regime in a Western U.S. watershed.\nAn aerial photography record dating from the time when the new fire regime was instituted shows that the repeated fires in the Illilouette Basin have converted many forested areas into meadows, shrublands, and wetlands. Preliminary measures of soil moisture and plant water potential during summer suggest that the changes in vegetation type are associated with changes in plant water availability, allowing the aerial photography record to be interpreted in hydrological terms. With reduced leaf area to support transpiration and interception of winter snows, the new vegetation cover in the Illilouette Basin is hypothesized to increase water storage and yields, and may be associated with observed increases in the runoff ratio from the Illilouette Basin.",

            "abstract": "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University New Brunswick (Canada) and the University of Hawaii have developed a concept to provide open ocean tsunami wave height estimates using very accurate measurements of absolute total electron content (TEC) perturbations. Ionosphere-derived tsunami wave height estimates from our CubeSat for Natural-Hazard Estimation With Ionospheric Sciences (CNEWS) mission will refine the tsunami source energy calculation and improve the tsunami scale calculation for a localized region. As a secondary science objective, transmitting impulsive HF/VHF (10-40 MHz) transmissions through the ionosphere will provide in-situ geomagnetic disturbance measurements, which allow for discrimination between tsunami-induced signatures and space-weather-related fluctuations.\nNASA has invested several millions of dollars in the development of a tsunami warning system based on geodetic measurements from ground-based GPS stations. Leveraging this investment by simultaneously using ionospheric measurement from this GPS network for the detection of tsunamis represents a significant step forward. GPS ionospheric imaging is limited, however, by the slowly changing satellite geometry and its weak absolute TEC resolution (about 3 TECU). It has also been shown that GPS ionospheric imaging alone cannot distinguish between space weather fluctuations and those due to natural hazards. The very precise ionospheric measurements generated by CNEWS are expected to provide a quasi-static image of tsunami ionospheric signatures that we will use in an advanced model inversion technique to estimate tsunami wave heights at 10 cm (one sigma) uncertainty. The geomagnetic field strength resolution is also a key constraint for discriminating between natural hazards and space weather effects. HF/VHF impulses can resolve absolute TEC measurements at the 0.02 TECU level and geomagnetic field strength may be measured at 50 nT resolution.",

This specification represents a dynamical adjustment to the raw SAT field, which reduces ensemble spread by accounting for the influence of spontaneously-occurring atmospheric circulation changes unique to each ensemble member (EM). When applied independently to the simulated Northern Hemisphere (NH) SAT field from individual EMs, the methodology yields a dynamical adjustment that accounts for nearly 50% of the cold season SAT variance in each EM, validating a previous application of PLS regression to observations. Dynamical adjustment is also applied to SAT trends across the large IC ensemble, enabling the attribution of multi-decadal trends to external forcing and internal variability as well as dynamical and radiative/thermodynamic processes. When applied to the ensemble of SAT and SLP trends over a multi-decadal mid-21st Century reference interval, the methodology yields a dynamical adjustment that explains over 75% of the intra-ensemble variance of the NHSAT warming trend and accounts for about 5% of the ensemble-mean NHSAT warming trend. This methodological framework may be applied to other large IC ensembles, other climatological variables, and across a wider variety of time scales in order to investigate the role of internal variability in modulating the magnitude and patterns of historical and projected climate change.",

For example, NE CSC researchers are analyzing the effect of climate change on the timing and volume of seasonal and annual streamflows and the concomitant effects on ecological and cultural resources; developing techniques to monitor tree range dynamics as affected by natural disturbances which can enable adaptation of projected climate impacts; studying the effects of changes in the frequency and magnitude of drought and stream temperature on brook trout habitats, spatial distribution and population persistence; and conducting assessments of northeastern regional climate projections and high-resolution downscaling.

            "abstract": "The effect of AMOC variations on SST, and climate in general, is a subject of intense studies. One important aspect of this connection is whether the AMOC impacts are localized in the Northern hemisphere or extend to the Southern hemisphere as well. In particular, the Atlantic SST dipole index, designed to reflect the interhemispheric seesaw changes in sea surface temperatures, has been proposed to approximate AMOC variations over the duration of the instrumental temperature record. Using historical and control simulations of the CMIP5 dataset, here we investigate whether this index provides a good proxy for AMOC variability on decadal to centennial timescales and whether in fact the SST response on these timescales is interhemispheric in nature or centered more on the North Atlantic. In parallel we estimate the overall sensitivity of North Atlantic SSTs to AMOC variations. We find that indeed the power spectra of AMOC variations and the Atlantic dipole index share common spectral peaks in many models, and the two indices typically correlate with coefficients ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 with a few year lead. However, even for the models with the highest correspondence between the AMOC and the Atlantic dipole, the correlation between the two is mainly controlled by SST variations in the North Atlantic. Taking into consideration the South Atlantic SST does not improve this correlation, and in many cases makes it significantly worse. We conclude that on decadal to centennial timescales AMOC variations mainly affects the North Atlantic, with the SST sensitivity of the North Atlantic SST given by the CMIP5 multi-model average of about 0.3oC per 1Sv of AMOC change. However, on average AMOC variations explain only 30% of variability associated with the simulated Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).",

The magnetospheric and ground-based data necessary to test the two competing theories have only recently become available with the launch of NASA's THEMIS mission in 2007 and the Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) deployment of an all-sky imaging network. We present research testing the \"Auroral Streamer\" hypothesis given by Nishimura, Lyons, et al. in their various papers from 2010 to present. We compiled a list of all their published events (numbering 455, and covering a span from 2007 to 2011) and reviewed ground-based white- and red-light image files, THEMIS satellite bulk plasma velocity and magnetic field strength measurements, ground-based magnetometer observations, and 1-minute Auroral Electrojet (AL) index data. We visually categorized the events by auroral phenomenology, separating events with auroral streamers from those without, and analyzed the characteristics of the events with superposed epoch analyses. Although Nishimura, Lyons et al. argued that every event in their onset list constituted an \"Auroral Streamer\" onset, our results show that most events in the list are not poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs). In contrast to these previous studies, the results suggest that the \"auroral streamer\" model is not widely applicable. This is the first time these events have been analyzed with such detail, and call into question fundamental aspects of this model.",

            "abstract": "Pavilion Lake in British Columbia, Canada is an ultra-oligotrophic lake that has abundant microbialite growth. Recent research has shown that photoautotrophic microbial communities are important to modern microbialite development in Pavilion Lake. However, questions remain as to the relationship between changing light levels within the lake, variation in microbialite macro-structure, microbial consortia, and the preservation of associated biosignatures within the microbialite fabrics. The 2014 Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP) field program was focused on data gathering to understand these complex relationships by determining if a) light is the immediate limit to photosynthetic activity and, if so, if light is distributed around microbialites in ways that are consistent with emergent microbialite structure; and b) if at more local scales, the filamentous pink and green cyanobacterial nodular colonies identified in previous PLRP studies are centers of photosynthetic activity that create pH conditions suitable for carbonate precipitation. A diver-deployed pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer was used to collect synoptic in situ measurements of fluorescence yield and irradiance and across microbialites, focusing on comparing flat and vertical structural elements at a range of sites and depths. As well, we collected time series measurements of photosynthetic activity and irradiance at a set depth of 18 m across three different regions in Pavilion Lake. Our initial findings suggest that all microbialite surfaces are primarily light-limited regardless of depth or location within the lake. Shore based PAM fluorometry and microelectrode profiling of diver-collected samples suggest that pink and green nodules have different photosynthetic properties and pH profiles, and that nodular growth is likely to be the primary route of calcification due to the gelatinous covering the nodule creates. On-going tests for molecular signatures and isotopic shifts will allow for further examination of surface microvariation and the associated influence on microbialite development.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis are low frequency but high impact natural disasters. In 2004, the Boxing Day tsunami killed hundreds of thousands of people from many nations along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean. Tsunami run-up exceeded 35 m. Seven years later, and in spite of some of the best warning technologies and levels of preparedness in the world, the Tohoku-Oki tsunami in Japan dramatically showed the limitations of scientific knowledge on tsunami sources, coastal impacts and mitigation measures. The experience from Japan raised serious questions on how to improve the resilience of coastal communities, to upgrade the performance of coastal defenses, to adopt a better risk management, and also on the strategies and priorities for the reconstruction of damaged coastal areas. Societal resilience requires the reinforcement of capabilities to manage and reduce risk at national and local scales.\nASTARTE (Assessment STrategy And Risk for Tsunami in Europe), a 36-month FP7 project, aims to develop a comprehensive strategy to mitigate tsunami impact in this region. To achieve this goal, an interdisciplinary consortium has been assembled. It includes all CTWPs of NEAM and expert institutions across Europe and worldwide. ASTARTE will improve i) basic knowledge of tsunami generation and recurrence going beyond simple catalogues, with novel empirical data and new statistical analyses for assessing long-term recurrence and hazards of large events in sensitive areas of NEAM, ii) numerical techniques for tsunami simulation, with focus on real-time codes and novel statistical emulation approaches, and iii) methods for assessment of hazard, vulnerability, and risk. ASTARTE will also provide i) guidelines for tsunami Eurocodes, ii) better tools for forecast and warning for CTWPs and NTWCs, and iii) guidelines for decision makers to increase sustainability and resilience of coastal communities. In summary, ASTARTE will develop basic scientific and technical elements allowing for a significant enhancement of the Tsunami Warning System in the NEAM region in terms of monitoring, early warning and forecast, governance and resilience.\nThis work is funded by project ASTARTE - Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe.

However, few measurements of biomass burning have been made in temperate regions. This study quantifies the emission factors of trace gases and fine particles from 16 agricultural fires in the southeastern U.S. sampled during the SEAC4RS campaign. The evolution of reactive nitrogen species (PANs, NOx, and nitrate) and ozone in these fire plumes was also studied. The agricultural fires emitted significant levels of sulfur and chlorine. Sulfur was mainly emitted as SO2 while chlorine was mainly found in the form of particulate chloride. The preliminary emission factors of SO2, sulfate, and chloride are larger than those for other types of biomass burning with average values of 0.92±0.50, 0.21±0.19, and 1.1±0.73 g/kg. Emission factors of other major gaseous (such as hydrogen cyanide, hydroxyacetone, acetonitrile, and monoterpenes) and particulate species (such as nitrate and ammonium) and their variations in agricultural fires will also be examined. PAN was found to form very rapidly in the sampled plumes of agricultural fires. The ratio of PAN to NOy reached up to 40% in less than 1 hour. Other peroxyacyl nitrates (APAN, PPN, and PiBN) all formed rapidly at similar speeds. O3 formation occurred in most agricultural fire plumes but O3 destruction was also observed.",

            "abstract": "The temporal evolution and spatial configuration of continents can be analyzed through their response to long-term forces, as a function of the elastic property of the lithosphere, which is parameterized as effective elastic thickness (Te). The Te method has been widely used as a key proxy to examine the long-term strength/rigidity structure of the lithosphere. The present study employs the gravity inversion and flexure inversion techniques that operate in spatial domain in order to estimate the spatial variation of Te as well as the Moho configuration along the western continental margins of India (WCMI) and eastern continental margin of Madagascar (ECMM). The main objective of the present study is to understand the nature of isostasy and structure of the lithosphere along these conjugate passive margins. The results correlate well with the continental and oceanic regional-scale structures including ridges and basins in the WCMI and ECMM that reveal their mode of evolution. This study obtained comparable results from both the passive margins such as a linear zone of anomalously low-Te (1–5 km) along the WCMI (~1680 km long), which exactly correlates with the low-Te patterns obtained all along the ECMM. These low-Te zones along the passive margins are attributed as paleo-rift inception points of lithosphere thermally and mechanically weakened by the combined effects of the Marion hotspot and lithospheric extension due to rifting. When these conjugate passive margins were correlated by matching the mirrored low-Te linear zones, obtained a best fit position of Madagascar against India during the Gondwana Rifting time. The hence derived India-Madagascar paleo-fit model is well justified by the best close-fit of the crustal geometry and bathymetry of the continental shelf margins, and also by the matching of tectonic lineaments, lithology and geochronological belts along the margins of both the continents.",

            "abstract": "Yellowstone caldera, Wyoming, hosts one of the largest hydrothermal systems on Earth, fueled by heat and volatiles released from hotspot-derived basalt magmas that stall in the crust. Prolonged hydrothermal activity has pervasively altered the subsurface and such altered material is presumed to have acted as a source for magmas erupted after the two largest caldera eruptions, as evidenced by low-δ18O signatures in these magmas. This study focuses on the youngest Yellowstone volcanic units, the ~ 255 ka to ~ 70 ka large volume (~ 360 km3) Central Plateau Member (CPM) rhyolites. New laser-ablation ICP-MS whole rock, glass and mineral trace element data were obtained in order to refine existing constraints on CPM petrogenesis. Small temporal increases in elements such as As (3.1-4.1 ppm), Rb (170-200 ppm), Cs (3.6-4.3 ppm), Pb (26-31 ppm), Th (23-27 ppm) and U (5.4-6.8 ppm) contrast with increases of ~ 40-50 % in HFSE and REE in the same samples. The highest observed temporal increase is that of Zn, from 65 to 105 ppm. Caesium is highly incompatible with mineral/glass partition coefficients KD < 0.05 measured in all investigated mineral phases. Rubidium is also incompatible but its sanidine/glass KD ~ 0.4 results in a larger bulk distribution coefficient DRb ~ 0.2. For Pb, sanidine/glass KD ~ 0.8 leads to DPb > 0.4. Zinc is observed to be compatible in clinopyroxene, fayalite, zircon, chevkinite (KD ~ 5-12), and Fe-Ti oxides (KD ~ 40), such that DZn may approach 1. Fractional crystallization or partial melting processes alone cannot explain the same small increase rate of elements with diverse degrees of incompatibility (Rb, Cs and Pb), nor a larger increase rate in nearly compatible Zn. Assimilation by the juvenile CPM magmas of a crustal material of distinct composition appears to be required, and hydrothermally altered rhyolites, comprising much of the Yellowstone subsurface represent the most likely assimilant. Lower Rb, Cs, Pb (perhaps also As and U) and higher Zn concentrations in this altered rock horizon would explain the unusual temporal variations in these fluid-mobile elements in CPM lavas. As the CPM magma bodies developed and evolved, fractionating some mineral phases, they also assimilated these altered rhyolites, modifying incompatible trace element increase rates.",

            "abstract": "There is close agreement among three of the four experimental studies that have ‘calibrated’ the P–T dependencies of Ti-in-quartz solubility. New experiments were conducted to identify potential experimental disequilibrium, and determine which Ti-in-quartz solubility calibration is most accurate. Quartz and rutile were synthesized from SiO2- and TiO2saturated aqueous fluids in a forward-type experiment at 925°C and 10 kbar in a piston-cylinder apparatus. A range of crystal sizes was examined to determine if growth rate affected Ti incorporation in quartz. Cathodoluminescence (CL) images and electron microprobe measurements show that intercrystalline and intracrystalline variations in Ti concentrations are remarkably small regardless of crystal size. The average Ti-in-quartz concentration from the forward-type experiment is 392±1 ppm Ti, which is within 95% confidence interval of data from the 10 kbar isobar of Wark and Watson (2006) and Thomas et al. (2010). Quartz from the forward-type experiment was used as starting material for reversal-type experiments. The high-Ti quartz starting material was recrystallized at 925°C and 20 kbar to reduce the solubility of Ti in recrystallized quartz to the equilibrium solubility concentration of the reversed P–T condition. The ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ reversal experiments produced polycrystalline quartzites. Rutile occurs as inclusions in quartz, and as individual crystals dispersed along quartz/quartz grain boundaries. Quartz that recrystallized during the reversal-type experiment has substantially lower Ti concentrations than the quartz starting material because Ti solubility at 20 kbar is significantly lower than at 10 kbar. Dark cathodoluminescent quartz with low Ti concentrations shows that extensive quartz recrystallization occurred at the reversal P–T condition. The average Ti concentration in quartz from reversal experiments is 94±2 ppm Ti, which is within the 95% confidence interval of a linear fit to the 20 kbar data of Thomas et al. (2010).\nThomas JB, Watson EB, Spear FS, Shemella FS, Nayak SK, Lanzirotti A (2010) Contrib Mineral Petrol 160:743–759\nWark DA, Watson EB (2006) Contrib Mineral Petrol 152:743–754",

            "abstract": "Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs) and their associated carbon cycle perturbations are hallmarks of the Cretaceous. Quantification of these short-term disruptions to the carbon cycle is needed to understand the nature and climatic tipping points of greenhouse gas-initiated OAEs. The Rose Creek Pit (RCP) locality, Dakota Formation, southeastern Nebraska, offers a unique opportunity to make these comparisons for OAE1d through a combination of δ13C analysis and stomatal index (SI).\nRCP is already known to contain the negative δ13C excursion of OAE1d in charcoal and bulk organic matter. We produced new δ13C curves from fossil gymnosperm charcoal (δ13C gym) and vitrain (δ13Cvit) collected at 30cm intervals at RCP. These new curves reproduce the negative δ13C isotopic excursion found in the earlier chemostratigraphic curves and confirm that RCP contains the record of the carbon isotope excursion associated with OAE1d. In the same stratigraphic interval, SI as a proxy for atmospheric CO2 was calculated from dispersed leaf cuticle of Pandemophyllum kvacekii, new morphotypes of Pandemophyllum, and the related species Pabiania variloba. Average SI responds to the negative δ13C excursion (~3‰) by a gradual decrease from 8.2 to 5.1. Both δ13C and SI return to pre-excursion values above the level of the excursion.\nFurthermore, we calculate a coeval CO2 increase of 141−470 ppm during the negative excursion on the basis of published transfer functions, a value smaller than those calculated for other Mesozoic carbon cycle perturbations assessed with SI (K-T and Tr-J Boundaries, OAE2, TOAE; 179−2000+ ppm). We estimate that between 282−940 Gt of carbon was added to the atmosphere during OAE1d, much less than that estimated for other events (358−4000+ Gt C). Calculated changes in radiative forcing (∆F ≈1.1−4.7 W/m2) and global temperatures (∆T ≈ 0.9−3.8 ⁰C) resulting from increased CO2 also suggest that OAE1d had a smaller global effect than other events (∆F ≈ 2.5−9.9 W/m2 and ∆T ≈ 2.0−7.9 ⁰C).",

            "abstract": "While understanding of climate change’s impact on coastal systems has recently seen great improvements, there still remains much to be understood, especially for systems as hydraulically complex as estuaries. The hydrodynamic climate in estuarine waters is controlled by multiple factors such as boundary conditions offshore (tides, waves), across the surface (winds), at the upper estuary margin (streamflow), as well as mean sea level. On the decadal to century scale, climate change modulated variability in these forcings will effect state of the overall system resulting in changes to experienced extreme water level events.\nA study of climate change impacts on two Pacific Northwest estuaries is presently underway. ADCIRC-SWAN is being used to conduct multi-decadal simulations of water levels across the study estuaries. A GCM-RCM configuration was selected from the NARCCAP project and then bias-corrected against the observation-based NARR data. This was separated into two data streams (historical and future) which were then run through a set of models in order to develop forcing for ADCIRC-SWAN. At the open ocean boundary, the model is forced with wave output from the WaveWatch III model. The free surface of the model is forced with surface winds and pressure. The streamflow boundaries are forced with hydrographs obtained from the Micromet - Snowmodel - Hydroflow suite of runoff routing models.\nThe ADCIRC-SWAN output provides time series data on total water levels (TWLs) throughout the model domain. These time series can be used to construct CDFs of water elevation at any site of interest and also to derive return periods for extreme water level events. Of particular interest to this study is how these products change from the historical to future runs and which processes (changing offshore waves, changing streamflow) are primarily responsible for the observed changes in flooding characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Irrigation is indispensable to the agriculture in dry inland river basins, and may significantly alter the regional water cycle which is often featured by complicated surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) interaction. Although field-scale processes of irrigation water are clearly understood, the hydrological impact of irrigation at a large basin scale has not well examined. It poses a challenge to the water resources management. Our studies presented a modeling approach to address this challenge. GSFLOW, an integrated SW-GW model, was improved to represent irrigation practices in the model simulation, and applied to the HeiHe River Basin (HRB), the second largest inland river basin in China. The mid-stream area of HRB is a semi-arid region with extensive oasis agriculture, typical of western China. A series of studies have been conducted. First, the model was applied to fuse the limited hydrological observations in the area and generate a coherent understanding of the regional water cycle. Spatially and temporally detailed information on the impact of irrigation was then achieved. Second, an innovative optimization approach, coupling the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and SCE-UA algorithms, was proposed for the complex model. Allocation of surface water and groundwater for the irrigation was optimized under different management scenarios. The optimization results not only helped understand the hydrological processes, but provided insights into the water resources management. Third, the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) was implemented to systematically address the modeling uncertainty. Spatial variation and temporal dynamics of the uncertainty associated with the irrigation practice in this area were revealed. The uncertainty results shed light on further data collection and model improvement. Overall, our study demonstrated the applicability and significant value of the integrated modeling approach in understanding the basin-wide impact of irrigation on the water cycle in dry inland areas.",

            "abstract": "CO2-brine relative permeability relations are important parameters in modeling scenarios such as CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers and CO2 enhanced recovery in oil reservoir. Many steady-state experimental studies on CO2-brine relative permeability showed that the CO2-brine relative permeability differs greatly from typical oil-brine relative permeability. Particularly, they reported a very small endpoint CO2 relative permeability of 0.1~0.2 at a relative high residual water saturation of 0.4~0.6.\nIn this study, we hypothesize the measured low endpoint CO2 relative permeability in previous studies was an experimental artifact that is primary due to low CO2 viscosity. We conducted steady-state CO2 drainage experiments by co-injecting equlibrated CO2 and brine into a long (60.8 cm) and low permeability (116-mD) Berea sandstone core at 20 °C and 1500 psi. During every experiment, both the overall pressure drop across the core and the pressure drops of the five independent and continuous sections of the core were monitored. The in-situ saturation was measured with a medical X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. In the center three sections where saturation was uniform, we determined the relative permeability to both brine and CO2 phases. In the entrance and exit sections, both measured pressure gradients and saturation were non-uniform. To cope with this, we make several self-consistent assumptions that reveal the nature of capillary entrance and effect in steady-state two-phase core flooding experiments. Based on these assumptions we determined the relative permeability to CO2 and CO2-brine capillary pressure simultaneously using measured pressure drops. We found: (1) a much higher endpoint CO2 relative permeability of 0.58 at a water saturation of 48%, (2) the entrance region with non-uniform saturation expanded CO2 relative permeability data to much lower water saturation, (3) the determined CO2-brine capillary pressure curve is self-consistent and matches with an independent Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) curve measured with a plug from the same Berea sandstone after appropriate scaling. Herein we propose a dimensionless number that estimates how much the measured overall pressure drop during steady-state two-phase flow is affected by capillary effects.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust aerosols often observed over California in winter and spring from long-range transport can be efficient ice nuclei (IN) and enhance snow precipitation in mixed-phase orographic clouds. On the other hand, local pollution particles can serve as good CCN and suppress warm rain, but their impacts on cold rain processes are uncertain. The main snow-forming mechanism in warm and cold mixed-phase orographic clouds (refer to as WMOC and CMOC, respectively) could be very different, leading to different precipitation response to CCN and IN. We have conducted 1-km resolution model simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a spectral-bin cloud microphysical model for WMOC and CMOC cases from CalWater2011. We investigated the response of cloud microphysical processes and precipitation to CCN and IN with extremely low to extremely high concentrations using ice nucleation parameterizations that connect with dust and implemented based on observational evidences. We find that riming is the dominant process for producing snow in WMOC while deposition plays a more important role than riming in CMOC. Increasing IN leads to much more snow precipitation mainly due to an increase of deposition in CMOC and increased rimming in WMOC. Increasing CCN decreases precipitation in WMOC by efficiently suppressing warm rain, although snow is increased. In CMOC where cold rain dominates, increasing CCN significantly increases snow, leading to a net increase in precipitation. The sensitivity of supercooled liquid to CCN and IN has also been analyzed. The mechanism for the increased snow by CCN and caveats due to uncertainties in ice nucleation parameterizations will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Marine gravity from satellite altimetry has become a primary tool for investigating the tectonics of the remote ocean basins as well as unexplored continental margins especially in the polar regions where shipboard data are sometimes sparse. Gravity field accuracy depends on three factors: spatial track density, altimeter range precision, and diverse track orientation. Recently two new non-repeat altimeter data sets have become available from CryoSat-2 and Jason-1 to augment the data provided by Envisat, Geosat, and ERS-1/2. One question that arises is what is the unique contribution of each altimeter? To answer that question we have constructed 5 global gravity models omitting data from CryoSat-2, Jason-1, Envisat, Geosat, and ERS-1/2 respectively. We find each satellite provides an important contribution. CryoSat-2 has the best polar coverage and highest track density so provides the greatest improvement overall. Envisat has excellent high latitude coverage where it provides the greatest improvement in the Arctic. Jason-1 has the lowest orbital inclination so provides a dramatic improvement in the E-W gravity component for latitudes < 60. We have verified an overall gravity accuracy in the Gulf of Mexico of 1.6 mGal. This is sufficient to reveal previously unknown sub-seafloor structure buried under sediment on the continental margins. The accuracy in the Arctic is generally worse and highly variable depending on the extent of permanent ice cover. The major error sources in marine gravity are now due to ice coverage, inaccurate coastal tide models, mesoscale variability, permanent dynamic topography, and the errors in land gravity, which migrate into the nearby oceans during the conversion from geoid height to gravity. The high-resolution gravity field (~80 km) being provided by the GOCE mission may help to reduce these error sources.",

            "abstract": "Despite convincing evidence of deep ocean warming, temperature changes over the shelves have proven difficult to quantify as most long-term records lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed to resolve shelf variability. XBT data have been collected for 37 years along a repeat track from New Jersey to Bermuda from the MV Oleander providing the resolution necessary for shelf analysis. The XBT temperature data on the shelf (onshore of the 80 m isobath) were binned with 10 km horizontal and 5 m vertical resolution to produce monthly and annually averaged temperature sections. A climatology produced from the binned data identifies key seasonal temperature features consistent with previous climatologies, showing the utility of the XBT data. Annual spatially-averaged shelf temperatures have trended upwards since the beginning of the record in 1977 (0.025 C/yr), with recent trends (i.e., since 2002, 0.10 C/yr) substantially larger than the overall 37- year trend. Comparison of composite sections for the most anomalous years suggests that the interannual variability in the spatially-averaged temperatures is most heavily influenced by temperature anomalies near the shelf break.\nThe spatially-averaged temperature anomalies are not correlated with annually-averaged coastal sea level anomalies from tide gauges at zero lag, which suggest that interannual variability in coastal sea level is not due to thermo steric effects. However, a strong positive correlation is found between 2-year lagged temperature anomalies and coastal sea level anomalies. This relationship is most pronounced for the shelf break temperature anomalies, with the strongest 2-year lag correlations found in winter and spring. Connections between the observed interannual to decadal temperature variability on the shelf and variability in the AMOC are being investigated in an ongoing effort to better understand open-ocean/shelf interactions in the Northwest Atlantic.",

Path-integrated measurements that integrate through the entire mixed layer are valuable complements to surface data, compatible with the scale of the atmospheric models and therefore help reduce the representation errors in data assimilation studies of surface emission rates.\nHere we present a ground-based column sensor network in metro Boston. The network extends the existing surface sensor network to the vertical dimension in order to help quantify the concentration gradients across a city using a differential strategy: by measuring the “total column” of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, H2O etc.) and pollutants (NO2, O3, CH2O etc.) simultaneously inside and upwind of the urban core. Each stationary network site has a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker, EM27Sun), a UV-visible grating spectrometer (Pandora) and a LIDAR (Sigma Space, Mini MPL) to provide PBL height.\nTwo EM27Sun Fourier transform spectrometers at fixed locations are complemented by our self-developed solar-tracking Fourier transform spectrometer (Nicolet) to be used as a mobile unit to acquire cross-sectional slices of total column burdens across the urban dome. In additional to O2, CO2, CH4, H2O measurements, this system is also capable of measuring CO and N2O. This compact, inexpensive instrument uses a diffuser as a part of the tracking optics, which results in a rugged and simplified system. A novel camera-based active tracking schema is developed: the sun image on the diffuser is always regulated to the same position to ensure an accurate tracking.\nIn this paper we will show comparisons between the self-developed solar-tracking system and the commercial Bruker EM27Sun. In addition, initial data for the retrieved column concentrations in and outside of the Boston urban dome will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Hangay Dome is a broad upland in central Mongolia characterized by a high elevation (>3000-4000 m), low relief landscape within the greater Mongolian Plateau (~2000 m avg. elevation) of central Asia. We have assessed the long-term, large-scale landscape evolution of the region using thermochronologic analysis. Detrital apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He samples from the Selenga River (n = 55) and Orkhon River (n = 15) basins north of the Hangay Dome yield central ages of 134.2 ± 6 and 131.3 ± 9.8 (1σ) Ma, respectively. The regional granitic bedrock apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He single grain age distribution is approximately 95 to 200 Ma, with a homogenized grain central age of 131.2 ± 6.1 Ma. These low-temperature data, in conjunction with K-feldspar MDD 40Ar/39Ar ages of ~200-230 Ma, suggest regional exhumation in the Mesozoic. HeFTy (Ketcham, 2005) modeling corroborates these data and suggests cooling rates of ~3°C/Ma from 220-185 Ma, and applying a geothermal gradient of 21 ± 3°C/km for central Mongolia (Lysak and Dorofeeva, 2003), rock uplift rates from Late Triassic to Mid-Late Jurassic are approximately 100 m/My and from the Early Cretaceous (130 Ma) to the present approximately ≤ 30 m/My. Regional bedrock age patterns, detrital age populations, and thermal modeling suggest that significant recent, rapid rock uplift in central Mongolia is unlikely. Pecube thermo-kinematic models (Braun, 2003) indicate that any rapid (> 500 m/My) event in the Late Miocene-Pliocene would produce Early-Mid Cenozoic cooling ages in lower elevations of the Selenga River drainage basin, which is not supported by the detrital age signal. Pecube modeling of slow rock uplift rates of <50 m/My since the Early Triassic produce regional ages in agreement with geomorphic and geochronologic data. Regional apatite helium age-elevation patterns suggest long-term thermal stability of the upper crust and possible lowering of relief since Mesozoic exhumation. Basalt total fusion 40Ar/39Ar ages demonstrate the existence of Hangay Dome paleotopography since the Early Miocene and subsequent Miocene-Pliocene base level rearrangement and landscape incision. Alpine cirques and preserved moraines are indicative of a more recent, climate-driven erosional signal in the higher peaks of the western Hangay, possibly augmented by modest surface uplift over the past 10 m.y.",

            "abstract": "The seasonal evolution of sea ice loss in the Beaufort Sea during 1979-2012 is examined, focusing on spatial differences between eastern and western sectors. Two stages in ice loss are identified: “opening” is defined as the spring decrease in ice concentration from its winter maximum below a value of 80% areal concentration; “retreat” is the summer decrease below 15% concentration. We consider three aspects of the problem, i.e. (i) the long-term mean, (ii) long-term linear trends, and (iii) year-to-year variability. We find that in the mean, ice opening occurs earliest in the southeast Beaufort Sea (SEB), forced by atmospheric heating acting on particularly thin ice relative to the southwestern Beaufort Sea (SWB). This thin SEB ice arises from divergence forced by easterly winds in fall and spring. There is no significant long-term trend in the date of SEB ice opening, although ice opening in the SWB is in fact trending toward earlier dates. This means that spatial differences in opening dates across the Beaufort Sea have been shrinking over the past 33 years, i.e., these dates are becoming more synchronous, a situation which may impact human and marine mammal activity in the area. Synchronicity in ice retreat dates is also increasing, although with no statistical significance at this time. Finally, we find that in any given year, an increase in monthly mean easterly winds of ~ 1 m/s during spring is associated with earlier summer retreat of 9-15 days, offering predictive capability with 1-2 months lead time.",

            "abstract": "In April, 2014 members of the SAGE team conducted an oversnow traverse from Thule AFB to the vicinity of the NEEM drill site. One component of this campaign was investigating 37 shallow snowpits along the route to characterize stratigraphy and microphysics, and also to collect samples for chemical analyses. All of the pits were sampled continuously at 3 cm resolution to depths encompassing the most recent year of accumulation (spring 2013 to spring 2014). Selected pits were sampled continuously from the surface down to the layer corresponding to summer 2012, results presented will be restricted to the top year of all pits. Large differences in the annual accumulation and seasonal variations of black carbon and major ions were observed between the pits. Some of these gradients were expected, as the traverse route covered a large range in both distance from the coast and elevation. In addition, we find significant differences in accumulation of chemical impurities in some pits that were relatively close together, especially in the lower and steeper parts of the traverse route. We hypothesize that the combination of local topography and the tracks of individual snow storms create higher variability over small spatial scales along the slopes of the ice sheet compared to the interior.",

Here, we report on observations of this ‘pulsing’ slip obtained from advanced multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. The surface deformation time series show a strong correlation to the previously documented slip rate variations derived from repeating earthquakes on the fault interface, at various spatial and temporal scales. Time series analysis reveals a quasi-periodic pulsing with approximately 2-year-long intervals along some sections of the fault in both InSAR and repeating earthquake datasets, with the earthquakes on the fault interface lagging behind the far-field deformation by about six months. This suggests a temporal delay between the pulsing crustal strain generated by deep-seated shear and the time-variable slip on the shallow fault interface, and that at least in some places this process may be cyclical.",

            "abstract": "The orthogneisses in the core of the Xuelong Shan block are surrounded by ductile and then brittle fault rocks. This lens-shape block is in fault contact with Triassic marbles on the eastern margin and Jurassic-Cretaceous mudstones on the western margin. The rocks in the core of the Xuelong Shan block contain multiply foliated feldspathic orthogneisses with local amphibolites, largely overprinted by protomylonitic deformation. Foliation strengthens to the east to become mylonites and ultramylonites, with a 30 m wide zone of loosely cemented fault breccia adjacent to brittlely faulted Triassic marbles. In contrast, the rocks to the west are dominated by brittle deformation, with mylonites becoming cataclasites and then breccias facing the mudstones to the east. Well-foliated phyllonites are locally present within the cataclasites. Early S1 gneissosity striking ENE are recognized only in the interior protomylonite. In the east, the dominate mylonitic S2 foliation strikes 340° with a moderate dip to the east, and an L2 mineral stretching lineation plunges gently north. However, in the west S2 cleavage is transposed into a NNW trending schistosity that dips steeply to the ENE, with down-dip mineral stretching lineations.\nWhole rock chemistry indicates a granitic to granodioritic protolith for all the rocks including the ultramylonites, but also suggests the progressive loss of alkalis with increasing deformation. Trace element compositions show these rocks lie in the volcanic arc/syn-collisional granite field. U-Pb SHRIMP ages show an Early Triassic age for these granite, with possible Middle Permian inheritance in some cores. These ages are consistent with the period of the closure of the northern Paleo-Tethys ocean. Metamorphic rim ages of ~ 30 Ma record a small amount of zircon dissolution/precipitation probably associated with the Oligocene ductile deformation that produced the upper greenschist facies mylonites. These results support the geologic history of the ASRRSZ based on data obtained in the southern Diancang Shan block. Permian granitoids were intruded and ductily deformed in the Early Triassic. The left lateral shearing that brought these blocks to the surface was delayed until the Neogene extrusion of the Indochina block.",

Arroyos are an end-member channel form associated with ephemeral streams entrenched into cohesive, fine-grained, valley-fill. Historic arroyo entrenchment exposed 5-30 m of unconformity-bound packages of different aged Holocene alluvium. Chronostratigraphic reconstructions indicate that during the mid-late Holocene these systems underwent multiple periods of rapid episodic entrenchment followed by slow re-aggradation. Previous and ongoing work has developed alluvial chronostratigraphies of Kanab Creek, Johnson Wash, and surrounding streams in southern UT using a combination of stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon, and single-grain OSL dating. This research investigates the role of allogenic forcing (climate change) and autogenic processes on cut-fill dynamics. This study tests if temporal or spatial variations in sediment supply have influenced the timing and location of arroyo aggradation and entrenchment. We measured in-situ 10-Be in quartz from alluvial and colluvial sediment in Kanab Creek and Johnson Wash to quantify catchment-average erosion rates. Samples were collected from modern channels throughout the watershed and from dated alluvial packages preserved in arroyo walls. Results quantify spatial and temporal variability in sediment supply throughout the two watersheds as a function of lithology, slope, elevation, contribution of sediment stored in valley-fill, and time. Moreover, 10-Be results from dated Holocene alluvium will be used to evaluate if climate change has influenced sediment supply and arroyo cut-fill dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Sod based crop rotation (SBR) is a relatively new system of practice that incorporates at least 2 years of a perennial grass followed by a peanut and then cotton rotation. After 15 years of research on farm scale sites, this system has been found to have many advantages over conventional 3 year peanut-cotton-cotton rotations. These benefits include: increased profits; dramatic reductions in irrigation demand, fertilizer (N,P) pesticide use, and energy consumption; and, better carbon sequestration potential. The SBR system works primarily due to enhancement of plant root growth and improvement to soil properties. To forecast the water savings potential of sod based rotation, we employ the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate irrigation water demands over a 34 year period (1980-2013). We utilize data from a distributed network of weather stations to represent a range of climate conditions in the Florida, Georgia and Alabama area and data that represent a range of soil physical properties. The only calibration parameter adjusted in SWAT to distinguish between the new and conventional system of farming is rooting depth. Each model result providing 34 years of annual irrigation water requirements was fit to a cumulative probability distribution function to forecast the water savings potential of SBR. Depending upon soil type and weather station location, forecasted water savings using SBR ranged between 20.3 and 33.1 cm during a 10% chance drought year. With over 526,000 ha of irrigated conventional acres in cotton and peanut within the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina alone, this equates to a potential water savings of 1.07 billion to 1.74 billion m3 of water in a drought year. The cumulative mitigative effect of this system has yet to be realized through actual application in these states. However, even at low rates of application it is evident that SBR could significantly reduce the negative impacts of irrigation in the Southeast US as well as other locations where row crops grow in humid subtropical climates.",

            "abstract": "The morphology of lava flows is controlled by the physical properties of the lava and its effusion rates, as well as environmental influences such as surface medium, slope and ambient temperature and pressure conditions. The important rheological properties of lavas include viscosity (η) and yield strength (σy), strongly dependent on temperature (T), composition (X), crystal fraction (φc) and vesicularity (φb). The crystal fraction typically increases as temperature decreases, and also influences the residual liquid composition. The rheological behavior of multi-phase lava flows is expressed as different flow morphologies, for example basalt flows transition from smooth pahoehoe to blocky `a`a at higher viscosities and/or strain rates. We have previously quantified the rheological conditions of this transition for Hawaiian basalts, but lavas on Mercury are very different in composition and expected crystallization history.\nHere we determine experimentally the temperature and rheological conditions of the pahoehoe-`a`a transition for two likely Mercury lava compositions using concentric cylinder viscometry. We detect first crystals at 1302 ºC for an enstatite basalt and 1317 ºC for a basaltic komatiite composition representative of the northern volcanic plains (NVP). In both cases, we observe a transition from Newtonian to pseudo-plastic response at crystal fractions > 10 vol%. Between 30 to 40 vol%, a yield strength (τ0) around 26±6 and 110±6 Pa develops, classifying the two-phase suspensions as Herschel-Bulkley fluids. The measured increase in apparent viscosity (ηapp) ranges from 10 Pa s to 104 Pa s. This change in rheological properties occurs only in a temperature range up to 100 ºC below the liquidus.\nBy analogy with the rheological conditions of the pahoehoe-`a`a transition for Hawaiian basalts, we can relate the data for Mercury to lava flow surface morphology as shown in Figure 1, where the onset of the transition threshold zone (TTZ) for the enstatite basalt composition is around 1270 ˚C and 1300 ºC for the NVP composition. This is 70 ºC to 100 ºC higher than for Kilauea basalt. These data may allow emplacement temperatures and/or rates to be determined from remote sensing observations of the surface morphology of different volcanic fields on Mercury.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of both N2O emissions and NO3- leaching losses to quantify their individual responses to fertilization rate, tillage, and other practices. Overall, we assembled over 40 studies that reported fertilization rate, yield, and either N2O emissions or NO3- leaching losses over the growing season from North American corn fields. Our complete database ultimately included over 600 observations of N2O emissions or NO3- leaching. Notably, we found no individual studies that reported both NO3- leaching and N2O emissions. We used multiple regression to quantify the response of N loss pathways to fertilization rate; rotation crop and tillage practice; and climate and soil type. We also included yield as a predictor to better account for the magnitude of surplus N. We found insufficient data to address effects of fertilizer placement, timing and source. On a mass basis, NO3- losses were far greater than N2O emissions. Both NO3- leaching and N2O emissions exhibited positive relationships with fertilizer rate and surplus N, but the responses of N loss pathways to environmental conditions and to various management practices varied considerably. These results suggest that minimizing excess fertilizer application will both improve water quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but that other practices such as tillage induce tradeoffs between these N loss pathways.",

            "abstract": "The Math You Need (TMYN) modules were introduced at Baylor University in fall 2012 to address issues of math anxiety common among freshmen non-majors completing their lab science requirement, and to reduce lab time spent reviewing basic math concepts. Modules and associated assessment questions commonly use geoscience examples to illustrate the mathematical principles involved, reinforcing topics addressed in lab. Large enrollments in the course selected for these modules necessitate multiple graduate teaching assistants in the lab, making the online nature of the modules and minimal required involvement of the teaching assistants even more valuable. Students completed three selected modules before encountering associated topics in lab, as well as a pre and post-test to gauge improvement. This presentation will review lessons learned and changes made in the first two years of TMYN at Baylor. Results indicate continued increases in mean pre to post test scores (e.g. 3.2% in fall 2012 to 11.9% in spring 2014), percentage of student pre to post- test improvement (59% in fall 2012 to 72% in spring 2014) and student participation (95 in fall 2012 to 186 in spring 2014). Continued use of these modules is anticipated.",

            "abstract": "Subaqueous mudflows are known to be ubiquitous across the Mississippi River delta front (MRDF) and have been identified as a hazard to offshore infrastructure. Among other factors, sediment accumulation rates and patterns play an important role in governing the stability of delta front sediment. High sedimentation rates result in underconsolidation, slope steepening, and increased biogenic gas production, which are all known to decrease stability. Sedimentation rates are highly variable across the MRDF, but are highest near the mouth of Southwest Pass, which carries the largest percentage of Mississippi River sediment into the Gulf of Mexico. Since the 1950s, the sediment load of the Mississippi River has decreased by ~50% due to dam construction upstream. The impact of this decreased sediment load on MRDF mudflow dynamics has yet to be examined. We compiled MRDF bathymetric datasets, including historical charts, industry and academic surveys, and NOAA data, collected between 1764 and 2009, in order to identify historic trends in sedimentation patterns.\nThe progradation of Southwest Pass (measured at 10 m depth contour) has slowed from ~66 m/yr between 1764 and 1940 to ~25 m/yr between 1940 and 1979, with evidence of further deceleration from 1979-2009. Decreased rates of progradation are also observed at South Pass and Pass A Loutre. Advancement of the delta also decelerated in deeper water (15-90 m) offshore from Southwest Pass. In this area, from 1940-1979, depth contours advanced seaward ~25 m/yr, but did not advance from 1979-2005. Furthermore, over the same area and time ranges, the sediment accumulation rate decreased by ~82%. We expect these sedimentation trends are occurring across the delta front, with potential impacts on spatial and temporal patterns of subaqueous mudflows. The MRDF appears to be entering a phase of decline, which will likely be accelerated by future upstream sediment diversion projects. New geophysical data will be required to assess potential mudflow hazards associated with new MRDF sedimentation rates and patterns (See Part 2, Obelcz et al.).",

            "abstract": "We present a preliminary analysis of the crustal and upper mantle structure for off-shore regions in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. These regions have anomalous oceanic lithosphere: the upper mantle of the North Atlantic ocean is affected by the Iceland plume, while the Arctic ocean has some of the slowest spreading rates. Our specific goal is to constrain the density structure of the upper mantle in order to understand the links between the deep lithosphere dynamics, ocean spreading, ocean floor bathymetry, heat flow and structure of the oceanic lithosphere in the regions where classical models of evolution of the oceanic lithosphere may not be valid. The major focus is on the oceanic lithosphere, but the Arctic shelves with a sufficient data coverage are also included into the analysis.\nOut major interest is the density structure of the upper mantle, and the analysis is based on the interpretation of GOCE satellite gravity data. To separate gravity anomalies caused by subcrustal anomalous masses, the gravitational effect of water, crust and the deep mantle  is removed from the observed gravity field. For bathymetry we use the global NOAA database ETOPO1. The crustal correction to gravity is based on two crustal models: (1) global model CRUST1.0 (Laske, 2013) and, for a comparison, (2) a regional seismic model EUNAseis (Artemieva and Thybo, 2013). The crustal density structure required for the crustal correction is constrained from Vp data. Previous studies have shown that a large range of density values corresponds to any Vp value. To overcome this problem and to reduce uncertainty associated with the velocity-density conversion, we account for regional tectonic variations in the Northern Atlantics as constrained by numerous published seismic profiles and potential-field models across the Norwegian off-shore crust (e.g. Breivik et al., 2005, 2007), and apply different Vp-density conversions for different parts of the region. We present preliminary results, which we use to examine factors that control variations in bathymetry, sedimentary and crustal thicknesses in these anomalous oceanic domains.",

            "abstract": "Sustainability awareness is increasingly a subject in educational settings. Marine science classes are perfect\nsettings of establishing sustainability awareness owing to declining populations of organisms and perceived\ncollapse in fisheries worldwide. Students in oceanography classes often request more direct exposure to actual\nocean situations or field trips. During regular session (13 week) or shorter term (4 week) summer classes such long\ntrips are logistically difficult owing to large numbers of students involved or timing. This new approach to such a\ncourse supplement addresses the requests by utilizing local resources and short field trips for a limited number of\nstudents (20) to locations in which Ocean experiences are available, and are often supported through education\nand outreach components. The vision of the class was a mixture of classroom time, readings, along with paper\nand laboratories. In addition, short day-long trips to locations where the ocean was “captured” were also used to\nsupplement the experience as well as speakers involved with aquaculture. Central Virginia is a fortunate location\nfor such a class, with close access for travel to the Chesapeake Bay and numerous field stations, museums with\nocean-based exhibits (the Smithsonian and National Zoo) that address both extant and extinct Earth history, as\nwell as national/state aquaria in Baltimore and Virginia Beach. Furthermore, visits to local seafood markets at\nlocal grocery stores, or larger city markets in Washington, Baltimore and Virginia Beach, enhance the exposure to\nproductivity in the ocean, and viability of the fisheries sustainability. The course could then address not only the\nparticulars of the marine science, but also aspects of sustainability with discussions on ethics, including keeping\nanimals in captivity or overfishing of particular species and the special difficulties that arise from captive or\nculturing ocean populations. In addition, the class was encouraged to post web-based journals of experiences in\norder to share opinions of observations in each of the settings, including the evaluation of the foods they were\nconsuming during the class",

Heated, streaming electron distributions in the boundary layer on the magnetosheath side of the magnetopause are evidence of reconnection and an open magnetopause. A model for the location of reconnection is used to compare the modeled and observed streaming direction of the heated electron distributions. Magnetic reconnection at Saturn's magnetopause is predicted and observed to occur at locations similar to those at Earth's magnetopause. Although not conclusive, the results here are consistent with the expected importance of x-line drifts in suppressing low-shear reconnection.

            "abstract": "Observations of Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) are currently retrieved from the GOSAT and GOME-2 satellites, and will become available from OCO-2 shortly. The GOSAT (and OCO-2) satellite has a midday overpass time, while GOME-2 has a variable observation of approximately 0800-1100 local time. Previous studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between SIF and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), but lack the ability to investigate causes of spatiotemporal variability. We demonstrate an ability to simulate SIF using a landsurface model (the Simple Biosphere Model; SIB) for direct comparison to observations. We calculate fluorescence yield based on known relationships between photosynthesis and fluorescence, and calculate total SIF using existing leaf-to-canopy scaling factors.\nWe find that simulated SIF exceeds GOSAT retrieved SIF, especially in tropical and Boreal forests. Simulated SIF exceeds GOME-2 values in Boreal forest and in lower-productivity areas such as marginal desert and tundra. Observed SIF GOME-2 in croplands is significantly higher than simulations. SIF simulated for low- and high-productivity grassland and savanna show much less seasonal and interannual amplitude when compared to values from both satellites, implicating that model phenology and/or response to meteorological forcing is damped. Simulated SIF seasonal cycles are similar to observed from both satellites, and simulations are able to reproduce drought events such as occurred in Russia in 2010 and the Central USA in 2012. As simulated SIF more closely resembles observations, model estimates of GPP become more robust, as does our ability to understand and recreate the mechanisms involved in vegetation response to seasonal cycles and anomalous stress events such as drought.",

A total of 32 measurements of seismic noise have been completed on this site in order to see if lithological site effects are detectable with this H/V method. After checking the H/V curve reliability criteria (length of the window to be analyzed, the number of windows analyzed, standard deviation) and the criteria for clear peaks in H/V (conditions for the amplitude, conditions for stability) found in the SESAME project in 2004, the results of the H/V spectra obtained are generally very consistent and clearly indicate site effects with peak resonance frequencies between 3 and 14 Hz. The presence of these well defined frequency peaks in the H/V spectral ratio indicates that the ground motion can be amplified by geomorphological site effects.\nComparative analyzes of these H/V measurements with Grilla and Geopsy software were made in this paper to estimate the amplification magnitude of these effects. Graphical comparisons between the Grilla and Geopsy H/V maps were completed in this study and allow us to identify typical areas and their associated fundamental resonance frequencies.",

            "abstract": "The reflection variation and the polarization change with phase angle of radiation scattered from particulate materials has been studied for a century in efforts to understand the nature of clouds, aerosols, planetary ring systems and planetary regolith materials. The increase in reflectance as phase angle decreases, the ‘Opposition Effect’, has been well documented in astronomical observations and laboratory studies. Variations in linear polarization near small phase angles have also been well studied (e.g. Shkuratov et al.,2002, Rosenbush et al. 2015). While the phenomena have been well documented, a generally accepted physical explanation is still lacking despite many excellent theoretical modeling efforts.\nWe have undertaken a reductionist approach in deconstructing the process. We have fabricated a goniometer which permits us to present samples with discrete wavelengths of monochromatic light that is linearly polarized in and perpendicular to the scattering plane. We also can illuminate our samples with both right handed and left handed circular polarization senses. Silicon Avalanche Photodiodes record the reflected radiation from the sample after it has passed through linear and circular polarizing analyzers(Kroner et al.).\nThis reductionist approach permits us to measure the reflectance and polarization phase curves and the change in linear and circular polarization ratio (LPR and CPR) with phase angle between 0.056 and 17 degrees. LPR and CPR are found to be important indicators of the amount of multiple scattering in the medium (Hapke, 1990, Nelson et al, 1998, 2000;Hapke, 2012).\nThis approach provides a way to distinguish between suggested models and to gain greater insight into the process of the scattering of electromagnetic radiation in a variety of media.\nThis work was supported by NASA’s Cassini Science Program\nHapke, B.

            "abstract": "The vertical distribution of clouds in the trades, and how this distribution is linked to the thermodynamic structure of the lower troposphere, is emerging as a key factor in the assessment of modeled cloud feedbacks. The spread in cloud feedbacks and climate sensitivity may be attributed to how efficiently models dry the lower troposphere as climate warms. This relates to how models mix moisture vertically, and thus to how their clouds are distributed.\nA three year record of cloudiness and boundary layer structure from a ground-based remote sensing station at Barbados, situated in a typical trade-wind region, is used to gain insight into the major components of the cloud distribution, and how these vary with changes in atmospheric structure. These insights are then used to evaluate modeled cloud behavior in single time step (half-hourly) output of the ECMWF IFS and CMIP5 models, at a grid point nearby Barbados.\nCloudiness is found to be regulated by two components with a different sensitivity to the large-scale flow. Cloud near cloud base is on average the largest contributor to cloudiness, but is relatively constant on time scales much longer than a day. This is because turbulence and cumulus convection adjust fast to perturbations, and self-regulate the cumulus mass flux and cloudiness near cloud base. A secondary component consists mainly of stratiform outflow layers near the detrainment level of cumulus tops, which carry most of the variability on longer time scales. The organization of convection into larger and deeper clusters, which can vertically transport large amounts of moisture, appear key in regulating such outflow layers.\nSeveral models fail at reproducing these smaller scale processes that control trade-wind cloudiness in the current climate. The stratiform component in modeled distributions of trade-wind cloudiness is seldom pronounced, and their distributions tend to be bottom-heavy. Whereas observations suggest that changes in clouds are more likely manifested in the component of cloud aloft, models show large variances in their cloud base component instead. Hence, changes in cloudiness into a warmer climate predicted by models may be largely carried by changes that are unlike nature.",

This has motivated recent efforts to collect observations aimed at improving mixing estimates and parameterizations. The US/UK field program Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES), begun in 2009, is providing such estimates upstream of and within the Drake Passage. This region is characterized by topography, and strong zonal jets. In previous studies, mixing length theories, based on the assumption that eddies are dominated by a single wavenumber and phase speed, were formulated to represent the estimated mixing patterns in jets. However, in spite of the success of the single wavenumber theory in some other scenarios, it does not effectively predict the vertical structures of observed eddy diffusivities in the DIMES area. Considering that eddy motions encompass a wide range of wavenumbers, which all contribute to mixing, in this study we formulated a multi-wavenumber theory to predict eddy mixing rates. We test our theory for a domain encompassing the entire Southern Ocean. We estimated eddy diffusivities and mixing lengths from one million numerical floats in a global eddying model. These float-based mixing estimates were compared with the predictions from both the single-wavenumber and the multi-wavenumber theories. Our preliminary results in the DIMES area indicate that, compared to the single-wavenumber theory, the multi-wavenumber theory better predicts the vertical mixing structures in the vast areas where the mean flow is weak; however in the intense jet region, both theories have similar predictive skill.",

The results demonstrate a dramatic increase in springtime surface air temperature (SAT) over the Arctic since 1979. Physical analysis reveals the importance of large-scale poleward moisture and energy advection accompanied by an enhancement in net downward radiation flux, which result in the surface warming. The cloudiness could impact the surface radiation budget and retreat of sea ice cover reduces surface albedo, making an additional contribution to the surface warming. In addition to the overall evaluation of these physical processes, composite analysis suggests that relative contributions from these processes to the increased springtime SAT vary across different geographic sub-regions.",

            "abstract": "A high-resolution record of organic matter accumulation in sediments from a combined gravity-piston core was collected from a site located at a water depth of 104 m inside Nastapoka Sound in the south-eastern region of Hudson Bay. The drainage basins in this region of Hudson Bay coincide roughly with the present-day tree line location and are within the forest-tundra transition zone. CAT- Scan and multi-sensor core logger data revealed relatively uniform sediments throughout the core. 14C-based geochronology indicates that the combined record extends to ~3200 cal BP and that accumulation rates were relatively constant (0.1-0.2 cm/y). Organic carbon, inorganic carbon and nitrogen contents display down-core variability consistent with changes in organic matter inputs but overall relatively stable depositional conditions over the last 3,000 years. Compositionally, we measured steady increases in the carbon:nitrogen ratios and lignin phenol content of sedimentary organic matter from 3200 cal BP to present consistent with enhanced inputs of vascular plant-derived organic matter. Lignin compositions (i.e. S/V and C/V phenol ratios) throughout the core are consistent with contributions from a mixture of conifer and angiosperm non-woody plant sources. Steady decreases in both S/V and C/V phenol ratios since 3200 cal BP to the present indicate enhanced contributions from conifer-dominated vegetation and are consistent with a steady expansion of boreal forests (white and black spruce) over shrub -dominated tundra (dwaf birch, willows, sedges) in this southern Arctic region over the late Holocene. No clear trends in the ratio of combustion products over lignin products are evident, suggesting a low fire frequency in the area during the covered time span of the record.",

            "abstract": "Tens of millions of detectable meteors ablate in the Earth's upper atmosphere each second, creating turbulent plasma trails that persist for up to minutes as they dissipate into the background ionosphere. These trails produce easily detected radar signals with a wealth of information. This talk will present a detailed analysis of two aspects of meteor physics: (1) the early evolution of meteors as they first ionize and create radar reflections called head echoes, and (2) the later evolution as meteor plasmas develop turbulence and create radar signals called non-specular or range spread meteor trail echoes.\nHead echoes form when sublimated material from a meteoroid initially collides with atmospheric molecules and ionize. Kinetic theory shows that this plasma develops over a length-scale close to the ion mean-free-path but with a highly non-Maxwellian velocity distribution. We have developed an analytical model that improves the quantitative interpretation of head echo radar measurements and ionization efficiency (called the Beta parameter). This will help us calculate meteoroid and atmosphere parameters from radar head-echo observations.\nNon-specular meteor trail echoes develop when meteor plasmas become turbulent allowing the reflection of radar signals. We will analyze this system using 3D simulations of a dense column of meteor plasma embedded in a background ionosphere/thermosphere. While the meteor diffuses across the Earth's geomagnetic field B0, large electric fields develop because of the interplay between highly mobile but magnetized electrons and the heavier but collisionally demagnetized ions. These fields point mostly perpendicular to B0 and change slowly in the direction of B0. These simulations show that the electric field causes a substantial restructuring of the ionospheric plasma outside the trail but connected to it via B0. They also demonstrate the diffusive expansion of the trail and the development of waves both within and outside the trail. These massively parallel particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations reveal the nature of the highly anisotropic diffusion of meteors with some interesting surprises.",

            "abstract": "Mapping forest structure and aboveground biomass globally is a major challenge that the remote sensing community has been facing for decades. Radar backscatter is sensitive to biomass only up to a certain amount (about 150 tons/ha at L-band and 300 tons/ha at P-band), whereas lidar remote sensing is strongly limited by poor spatial coverage. In recent years radar interferometry, including its extension to polarimetric radar interferometry (PolInSAR), has emerged as a new technique to overcome the limitations of radar backscatter. The idea of PolInSAR is to use jointly interferometric and polarimetric radar techniques to separate different scattering mechanisms and retrieve the vertical structure of forests. The advantage is to map ecosystem structure continuously over large areas and independently of cloud coverage. Experiments have shown that forest height - an important proxy for biomass – can be estimated using PolInSAR with accuracy between 15% and 20% at plot level.\nAt AGU we will review the state-of-art of repeat-pass PolInSAR for biomass mapping, including its potential and limitations, and discuss how merging lidar data with PolInSAR data can be beneficial not only for product cross-validation but also for achieving better estimation of ecosystem properties over large areas. In particular, lidar data are expected to aid the inversion of PolInSAR models by providing (1) better identification of ground under the canopy, (2) approximate information of canopy structure in limited areas, and (3) maximum tree height useful for mapping PolInSAR temporal decorrelation. We will show our tree height and biomass maps using PolInSAR L-band JPL/UAVSAR data collected in tropical and temperate forests, and P-band ONERA/TROPISAR data acquired in French Guiana. LVIS lidar data will be used, as well as SRTM data, field measurements and inventory data to support our study. The use of two different radar frequencies and repeat-pass JPL UAVSAR data will offer also the opportunity to compare our results with the new airborne P-band ECOSAR and L-band DBSAR instruments developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate concretions often occur within fine-grained, organic-rich sedimentary rocks. This association reflects the common production of diagenetic minerals through biologic cycling of organic matter. Chemical analysis of carbonate concretions provides the rare opportunity to explore ancient shallow diagenetic environments, which are inherently transient due to progressive burial but are an integral component of the marine carbon cycle. The late Cretaceous Holz Shale (~80 Ma) contains abundant calcite concretions that exhibit textural and geochemical characteristics indicative of relatively shallow formation (i.e., near the sediment-water interface). Sampled concretions contain between 5.4 and 9.8 wt.% total inorganic carbon (TIC), or ~45 and 82 wt.% CaCO3, compared to host shale values which average ~1.5 wt.% TIC. Organic carbon isotope compositions (δ13Corg) are relatively constant in host and concretion samples ranging from ­–26.3 to –24.0‰ (VPDB). Carbonate carbon isotope compositions (δ13Ccarb) range from –22.5 to –3.4‰, indicating a significant but not entirely organic source of carbon. Concretions of the lower Holz Shale exhibit considerably elevated δ13Ccarb values averaging –4.8‰, whereas upper Holz Shale concretions express an average δ13Ccarb value of –17.0‰. If the remaining carbonate for lower Holz Shale concretions is sourced from marine fluids and/or dissolved marine carbonate minerals (e.g., shells), a simple mass balance indicates that ~28% of concretion carbon was sourced from organic matter and ~72% from late Cretaceous marine inorganic carbon (with δ13C ~ +2.5‰). Upper Holz Shale calculations indicate a ~73% contribution from organic matter and a ~27% contribution from inorganic carbon. When normalized for carbonate, organic contents within the concretions are ~2-13 wt.% enriched compared to host contents. This potentially reflects the protective nature of cementation that acts to limit permeability and chemical destruction of organic material. These data imply that concretion growth in shallow sediments can act as a significant and long-term sink for both marine inorganic and organic carbon.",

            "abstract": "The increase in surface albedo inherent to land clearing and cultivation (land-cover change, LCC) in the subtropical dry forests of the South American Chaco offsets part of the radiative forcing (RF) of the related carbon emissions. The magnitude of these albedo changes, however, is also dependent on shifts in agricultural practices (land-management change, LMC) and will influence the net effect on Earth's radiation balance as well as other potential feedbacks on climate. We quantified the surface albedo changes between 2001 and 2013 and the consequent shifts in the radiation balance resulting from LCC and LMC, using MODIS imagery a columnar radiation model parameterized with satellite data. Agricultural systems replacing dry forests presented a large variety of managements, ranging from pasture systems with remnant trees to different grain crops, displaying a wide range of phenologies. Cultivated lands showed higher and more variable albedo values (mean = 0.162, Standard Deviation = 0.013, n = 10,000 pixels) than the dry forests they replace (mean = 0.113, SD = 0.010, n = 10,000). These albedo contrasts resulted in a cooling RF of deforestation of -10.1 W m-2 on average, but both livestock and grain crop production systems showed large differences among the different land management options. For instance, livestock systems based on open pasture lands showed higher albedo change and RF (0.06 and -16.3 W m-2, respectively) than silvopastoral systems (0.02 and -4.4 W m-2). Similarly in cropping systems, the replacement of double-cropping by single summer crops, a widespread process in the region lately, resulted in higher albedo change (0.06 vs. 0.08) and RF (-16.3 vs. -22.3 W m-2). Although the effects of LCC on climate are widely acknowledged, those of LMC are still scarcely understood. In the Chaco region, the latter could play an important role and offer a yet-overlooked pathway to influence the radiative balance of our planet.",

Teachers have long served as team leaders, department chairs, and curriculum developers. But what happens when you go beyond these typical roles in professional development? Can teachers become lead communicators beyond the classroom? Can they become leaders of change on important topics like the climate?\nFor nearly a decade, PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating), funded by the National Science Foundation, has been teaming teachers with research projects in all fields of polar science. Teachers participate in hands-on field research experiences in the polar regions which focus heavily on climate change and climate science. Administrated by the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, the goal of PolarTREC is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing K-12 educators and polar researchers together.\nThe program fosters a teacher and researcher network, which accelerates the cross-pollination of knowledge in science practices, findings, and classroom implementation throughout disciplines. Evaluation data exposes a crucial dynamic that increases the potential for a successful climate change science campaign. Data indicates that teachers can tackle challenges such as reframing climate change science to better address the need for a particular campaign, as well as garnering the science project the necessary support through effective, authentic, and tangible communication efforts to policymakers, funders, students, and the public.\nResearchers reported the value of explaining their science, in-situ, allowed them to reframe and rework the objectives of the science project to attain meaningful outcomes. More than half of the researchers specifically noted that one of the strengths of the PolarTREC project is its benefit to the scientific process. The researchers also viewed PolarTREC as an essential outreach activity and improved the public perception of their scientific endeavors.\nThis presentation will speak to the PolarTREC program's best practice and findings on improved polar science communications as well as how the teachers have become the lead communicators in this time of rapid global change across all disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Fire is an important recurrent phenomenon that determines the distribution of global savanna biomes and tree cover in savanna ecosystems. Tropical savanna fires are almost exclusively ground fires, fueled by senescent herbaceous material, with crown fires being rare. Analyses of satellite-based fire activity and burned area (active fires and burn-scars) in tropical savannas reveal a close correlation with satellite-based estimates of total net primary productivity (NPP) in drier savannas, and apparent limitation by rainfall (fuel moisture) in wetter systems. However, these analyses of fire frequency and extent at continental scales ignore the different roles played by the herbaceous and woody vegetation components in promoting and/or suppressing fire ignition and spread. In this research we hypothesized that, since herbaceous vegetation provides the primary fuel, fire frequency and burn areas in African savannas and seasonal woodlands should correlate more closely with measurements of herbaceous NPP or end of season leaf area index (LAI), than with the NPP or LAI of the tree layer. Similarly, while fire patterns may correlate with patterns of total LAI and total NPP across Africa, the relationship will be confounded by variations in tree cover.\nOur objective is to understand how fire frequency and intensity vary with changes in herbaceous cover. To test our hypotheses we will use estimates of herbaceous and woody LAI that we have developed recently by partitioning MODIS LAI. We will explore how seasonal maximum herbaceous LAI and leaf area duration (LAD) (both potential proxies for accumulated fuel load) correlate with fire frequency in African savannas. We will demonstrate the MODIS LAI partitioning methodology, and present results on the divergent relationships between African savanna fires and total LAI, herbaceous LAI and herbaceous LAD.",

            "abstract": "The Upper Sacramento River area is vital to California’s water supply, and is susceptible to major floods. Recent studies indicate that orographic precipitation in this complex terrain involves both inland penetrating atmospheric rivers (ARs) and the Sierra barrier jet (SBJ). The southerly SBJ induces orographic precipitation along south-facing slopes in the Shasta region, whereas landfalling ARs ascend up and over the statically stable SBJ and induce orographic precipitation along west-facing upper slopes in the Northern Sierra Nevada. This paper explores the hypothesis that extreme daily precipitation here is controlled by the presence of both a landfalling AR and a SBJ.\nThree 10-year-long (2000–2011) observational datasets are used. ARs are identified from the Neiman et al. (2008) AR catalog that uses an SSM/I satellite-based AR-detection method from Ralph et al. (2004), whereas SBJ conditions are determined from Chico, CA wind profiler data using the method from Neiman et al. (2010). Extreme daily precipitation is identified from the average of 8 rain gauges spanning the region known as the “Northern Sierra 8-Station Index.” The “index” is used by water managers to assess water supply. Extreme events are defined as the 50 largest daily precipitation totals in the index for the 10-year period (the top ~1.37%).\nThese dates in the 8-station index are compared with the catalogs of landfalling ARs and SBJs. In summary, 46 of 50 (92%) extreme daily precipitation events are associated with landfalling ARs on either the day before or the day of precipitation, whereas 45 of 50 (90%) extreme daily precipitation events are associated with SBJ conditions. 38 of 50 (76%) extreme daily precipitation events are associated with both a landfalling AR and an SBJ. The 10 days with the largest daily precipitation in the index were all associated with both a landfalling AR and an SBJ. Thus, extreme daily precipitation in Northern California is strongly controlled by the presence of both a landfalling AR and a SBJ.",

            "abstract": "To estimate the impacts of the ongoing and accelerating climate disruption on societally important infrastructure and ecosystems, the most important primary tools are global climate models (GCMs), which simulate the earth system response to changing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. A considerable barrier to the use of GCM output for local and regional studies is that the biases in the GCM output must be corrected, and the regional impacts inferred from large-scale simulated climate features. A simple and generally effective method for accommodating systematic biases in GCM output is 'quantile mapping,' which has been applied to many variables and shown to reduce biases on average, even in the presence of non-stationarity. This type of bias correction has been applied at spatial scales ranging from areas of hundreds of kilometers to individual points, such as weather station locations. Since water resources and other models used to simulate climate impacts are sensitive to biases in input meteorology, the temptation is great to apply bias correction at a scale such that the corrected GCM output closely resembles historically observed data, though there can undesirable consequences to doing so, especially where spatial correlation of driving climate variables is important. In this presentation, the trade-offs involved in bias correcting GCM precipitation and temperature, especially at different spatial scales, are explored in the context of simulating extreme high and low stream flows in the Western United States.",

Gridded EI can visually show geographical patterns of emissions and their changes over time. These patterns, when available, are often determined using location data collected by regional governments, industries, and researchers. Datasets such as Carbon Monitoring and Action (CARMA,\nwww.carma.org\n) are particularly useful for mapping emissions from large point sources and have been widely used in the EI community. The EI community is aware of potentially significant errors in the geographical locations of point sources, including power plants. The big challenge, however, is to review tens of thousands of power plant locations around the world and correct them where needed. The Power Plant Mapping Student Project (PPMSP) is a platform designed for students in 4th through 12th grade to improve the geographical location of power plants indicated in existing datasets to benefit international EI research. In PPMSP, we use VENTUS, a web-based platform (\nhttp://ventus.project.asu.edu/\n) that invites citizens to contribute power plant location data. Using VENTUS, students view scenes in the vicinity of reported power plant coordinates on Google Maps. Students either verify the location of a power plant or search for it within a designated radius using various indicators, an e-guide, and a power plant photo gallery for assistance. If the power plant cannot be found, students mark the plant as unverified. To assure quality for research use, the project contains multiple checkpoints and levels of review. While participating in meaningful research that directly benefits the EI research community, students are engaged in relevant science curricula designed to meet each grade level’s Next Generation Science Standards. Students study energy, climate change, the atmosphere, and geographical information systems. The curricula is integrated with math and writing, connecting to the Common Core Standards. PPMSP is designed to be accessible and relevant to all learners, including students learning English. With PPMSP, students are empowered to participate in relevant research and become future leaders in mitigating climate change.",

(2007), the depocenter area, having an extension of ~ 10 km (E-W) x ~ 5 km (N-S), was delimited. The drilling campaign was carried out in April 2014, recovering a total of 51.50 m of sediment with a Usinger drilling machine (Ø 80 mm and 55 mm) and a Uwitec platform. To achieve efficient stratigraphic control at the site CHD (103° 02'W, 20° 15' N), 51.50 m of sediment were cored at three equidistant holes spread ca. 4 m: CHD-A (4.20 m), CHD-B (27.15 m) and CHD (20.15 m). The stratigraphic depth reached was 27.15 m. After recovery, the undisturbed sediment was extruded from iron tubes into PVC tubes and split longitudinally resulting one working half for laboratory work and the other as archive half. In total we obtained 103 \"half tubes\", that were protected with plastic film wrap and stored in plastic bags and keeping refrigerated at 4° C. The sediment collected is loose and its grain size is silty-clay, with the exception of volcanic material. The preliminary megascopic description of the sediment in CHD-A core based on color, presence of laminations, volcanic ash and black particles is as follows:\nCOLOR. (0 m-4.15 m) gray-brown; (4.15 m -22.15 m) dark gray; (22.15 m -27.15 m) gray-brown.\nLAMINATION. (0m-11.15m) Incipient to defined; (11.15m-22.15m) Absent; (22.15m-23.15m) Incipient; (23.15m-27.15m) Absent.\nVOLCANIC ASH. (0m- 27.15m) Few horizons mm in thickness. From 26.52 m - 26.66 m a thin layer of 14 cm was observed.\nBLACK PARTICLES. (0m-27.15m) Presence at different concentration of black particles (cf. charcoal)\nDIATOM & POLLEN. (0m-10m) Central diatom (Surirella sp and Cyclotella sp); Pinus sp.\nThe identification of different concentrations of charcoal is the opportunity to reconstruct the Holocene landscape dynamics in the watershed of Lake Chapala, regarding the fire history through anthracological studies. At the bottom (27.15 m) the conventional radiocarbon age is 9,740 BP. Thus a preliminary linear sedimetation rate is 2 mm yr-1.

            "abstract": "Two outstanding goals of solid earth geophysics are to determine the chemical structure of the Earth and to understand the dynamics of its interior. The dynamics of the mantle are controlled by density variations and combined knowledge of density structure and seismic velocities provide the strongest constraints on chemical heterogeneity. Unfortunately, most of the traditional geophysical methods such as seismic tomography and geodynamic modeling alone cannot adequately resolve the density structure within the mantle. Thus, seismic, geodynamic and mineral physics joint inversion methods have been applied to better understand the dynamics of the mantle in recent years (e.g. Simmons et al. 2010). In these joint inversions, P wave and S wave travel times, as well as four convection-related geodynamic observations (free air gravity, tectonic plate motion, dynamic topography, and the excess ellipticity of the core-mantle boundary) can be used to produce 3-D models of density and seismic velocities simultaneously. The approach initially attempts to find a model that assuming temperature controls lateral variations in mantle properties and then to consider more complicated lateral variations that account for the presence of chemical heterogeneity to further fit data. Here we present new joint inversion results include 50% more new S wave travel time data than in previous work and geodynamic data that extend to larger spherical harmonic degrees. In addition, temperature derivatives of P and S velocity and density have been determined using an updated mineral physics dataset. For the first time we include non-linear anelastic temperature effects on velocities in the joint inversion. The anelastic effects decrease the required high density component within the lower mantle superplumes. The hypothesis that temperature variations explain most observed heterogeneity within the mantle is consistent with our data.\n",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, ion microprobe analysis of speleothems (cave carbonates) has increased the temporal resolution of their oxygen isotope (δ18O) paleoclimate proxy records. Recent improvements in methodology, standardization, and imaging at the WiscSIMS lab make it possible to examine sub-annual patterns of δ18O variability at 10-µm-scale, revealing new seasonal paleoenvironmental information. We applied this technique to an important suite of Chinese stalagmites with conventional drill-sampled δ18O records that reflect changes in Asian Monsoon dynamics across the last deglaciation.\nSeasonal-resolution δ18O analyses in the Chinese stalagmites reveal regular patterns of annual δ18O variability. Quantitative assessment of the patterns identifies two important components in the δ18O records. First, the source and rainout histories of water vapors that ultimately yield rainfall over China play a primary role in determining the δ18O value of speleothem calcite year-round. Second, intra-annual patterns of calcite δ18O variability indicate that the annual proportion of monsoon precipitation changes systematically during the last deglaciation; the annual proportion of monsoon rainfall is greater during the Holocene and Bølling-Allerød than during the Younger Dryas.\nThis is the first time these components have been characterized in any speleothem δ18O record of monsoon dynamics because seasonal δ18O variability is lost by conventional drill-sampling. Ion microprobe analysis of speleothems can also produce year-by-year records of δ18O across abrupt climate change events. At the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition in a Kulishu Cave stalagmite, which spanned 16 years at 11.53 ky BP, there is a relatively smooth decrease in year-round δ18O(calcite). In contrast, the intra-annual δ18O patterns indicate that the increase in the annual proportion of monsoon rainfall across this transition is stochastic, implying that this record can distinguish the regional monsoon response from the hemisphere-wide atmospheric reorganization.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of subreach river bathymetry from remotely-sensed surface velocity data is presented using variational inverse modeling applied to the 2D depth-averaged, shallow-water equations (SWEs). A nested approach is adopted to focus on obtaining an accurate estimate of bathymetry over a small region of interest within a larger complex hydrodynamic system. This approach reduces computational cost significantly. We begin by constructing a minimization problem with a cost function defined by the error between observed and estimated surface velocities, and then apply the SWEs as a constraint on the velocity field. An adjoint SWE model is developed through the use of Lagrange multipliers, converting the unconstrained minimization problem into a constrained one. The adjoint model solution is used to calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to bathymetry. The gradient is used in a descent algorithm to determine the bathymetry that yields a surface velocity field that is a best-fit to the observational data. In this application of the algorithm, the 2D depth-averaged flow is computed within a nested framework using Delft3D-FLOW as the forward computational model. First, an outer simulation is generated using discharge rate and other measurements from USGS and NOAA, assuming a uniform bottom-friction coefficient. Then a nested, higher resolution inner model is constructed using open boundary condition data interpolated from the outer model (see figure). Riemann boundary conditions with specified tangential velocities are utilized to ensure a near seamless transition between outer and inner model results. The initial guess bathymetry matches the outer model bathymetry, and the iterative assimilation procedure is used to adjust the bathymetry only for the inner model. The observation data was collected during the ONR Rivet II field exercise for the mouth of the Columbia River near Hammond, OR. A dual beam squinted along-track-interferometric, synthetic-aperture radar (ATI-SAR) system was used which provides high-resolution nearly bank-to-bank vector-surface-velocity observations of the river mouth. Data and bathymetry estimation results are presented, and the algorithm results are compared to contemporaneous USGS measured bathymetry data, with favorable results.",

            "abstract": "Ice nucleation is the initial step in forming mixed-phase and cirrus clouds, and is well established as an important influence on global climate. Laboratory studies investigate at which cloud relevant conditions of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) ice nucleation occurs and as a result, numerous fundamentally different ice nucleation descriptions have been proposed for implementation in cloud and climate models. We introduce a new immersion freezing model based on first principles of statistics to simulate individual droplet freezing requiring only three experimental parameters, which are the total number of droplets, the uncertainty of applied surface area per droplet, and the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficient, Jhet, as a function as a function of T and water activity (aw), where in equilibrium RH=aw. Previous studies reporting frozen fractions (f) or Jhet for a droplet population are described by our model for mineral, inorganic, organic, and biological ice nuclei and different techniques including cold stage, oil-immersion, continuous flow diffusion chamber, flow tube, cloud chamber, acoustic levitation and wind levitation experiments. Taking advantage of the physically based parameterization of Jhet by Knopf and Alpert (Faraday Discuss., 165, 513-534, 2013), our model can predict immersion freezing for the entire atmospherically relevant range of T, RH, particle surface area, and time scales, even for conditions unattainable in a laboratory setting. Lastly, we present a rigorous experimental uncertainty analysis using a Monte Carlo method of laboratory derived Jhet and f. These results imply that classical nucleation theory is universal for immersion freezing. In combination with a aw based description of Jhet, this approach allows for a physically based and computational little demanding implementation in climate and cloud models.",

            "abstract": "Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is a thermally unstable reservoir for NOx that allows NOx to be transported large distances, enabling ozone formation far downwind from the original source. Sources of PAN precursors include anthropogenic combustion, biomass burning, lightning and biogenic emissions. PAN chemistry plays a key role in determining the global ozone distribution. Until now, available measurements have been sparse and generally limited to intensive field campaigns.\nThe Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), flying on the NASA Aura satellite, provides measurements of a range of trace gases that have spectral features in the thermal infrared, including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and PAN. PAN can be retrieved from TES spectra for cases where the volume mixing ratio is above ~0.2 ppbv [Payne et al., 2014].\nIn this work, we present TES retrievals of PAN and CO in the tropics over the ten-year lifetime of the Aura mission. The TES PAN dataset offers an unprecedented insight into the inter-annual variability of PAN in the tropics. We compare TES retrievals of PAN, CO and O3 in the tropics to simulations from the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model for austral spring (peak burning season) of selected years. In the tropics, GEOS-Chem predicts that the dominant sources of PAN are biomass burning and lightning. The version of GEOS-Chem used in this work has been specifically updated to improve the simulation of PAN [Fischer et al., 2014]. Similarities and differences between the TES measurements and the GEOS-Chem simulations are used to infer causes of inter-annual variability of tropical ozone.\n",

            "abstract": "Smectite has been detected as layered material hundreds of meters thick, in intracrater depositional fans, in plains sediments, and deposits at depth on Mars. If early Mars hosted a dense CO2 atmosphere, then extensive carbonate should have formed in the neutral/alkaline conditions expected for smectite formation. However, large carbonate deposits on Mars have not been discovered. Instead of neutral to moderately alkaline conditions, early Mars may have experienced mildly acidic conditions that allowed for Fe/Mg smectite formation but prevented widespread carbonate formation. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that Fe(II)/Mg-saponite and nontronite can form in mildly acidic solutions (e.g., pH 4). Synthetic basaltic glass (< 53 µm) of Adirondack rock class composition was exposed to pH 4 (acetic acid buffer) and N2 purged (anoxic) solutions amended with 0 and 10 mM Mg or Fe(II). Basaltic glass in these solutions was heated to 200ºC in batch reactors for 1, 7, and 14 days. X-ray diffraction analysis of reacted materials detected the presence of phyllosilicates as indicated by a ~15.03-15.23Ǻ (001) peak. Smectite was confirmed as the phyllosilicate after treatments with glycerol and KCl and heating to 550°C. Trioctahedral saponite was confirmed by the presence of a 4.58 to 4.63 Ǻ (02l) and 1.54Ǻ (060) peaks. Saponite concentration was highest, as indicated by XRD peak intensity, in the 10 mM Mg treatment followed by the 0 mM and then 10 mM Fe(II) treatments. This order of sapontite concentration suggests that Fe(II) additions may have a role in slowing the kinetics of saponite formation relative to the other treatments. Nontronite synthesis was attempted by exposing Adirondack basaltic glass to pH 4 oxic solutions (without N2 purge) at 200ºC for 14 days. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that mixtures of trioctahedral (saponite) and dioctahedral (nontronite) may have formed in these experiments based on the 02l and 060 peaks. Mössbauer analysis coupled with future experiments are planned to verify if nontronite can be formed under mildly acidic and oxic conditions. Results of this work demonstrate that acidic conditions could have occurred on an early Mars, which allowed for smectite formation but inhibited carbonate formation. ",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are often represented crudely in global models. We have implemented three new detailed SOA treatments within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) that allow us to compare the semi-volatile versus non-volatile SOA treatments (based on some of the latest experimental findings) and also investigate the effects of gas-phase fragmentation reactions. For semi-volatile SOA treatments, fragmentation reactions decrease simulated SOA burden from 7.5 Tg to 1.8 Tg. For the non-volatile SOA treatment (with fragmentation), the burden is 3.1 Tg. Larger differences between non-volatile and semi-volatile SOA (upto a factor of 5) correspond to continental outflow over the oceans. Compared to a global dataset of surface Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements and the US IMPROVE network measurements, the non-volatile SOA with fragmentation treatment (FragNVSOA) agrees best at rural locations. Urban SOA is under-predicted but this may be due to the coarse model resolution. Our revised treatments show much better agreement with aircraft measurements of organic aerosols (OA) over the N. American Arctic and sub-Arctic in spring and summer, compared to the standard CAM5 formulation. This is due to treating SOA precursor gases from biomass burning, and long-range transport of biomass burning OA at elevated levels (also supported by satellite data), which undergoes less wet removal compared to the surface OA sources in the standard CAM5. Although the total simulated OA from biomass burning agrees better with aircraft measurements, recent field observations typically report lower SOA formation, suggesting that constraining the POA-SOA split from biomass burning should be the focus of future studies. The non-volatile and semi-volatile configurations predict the direct radiative forcing of SOA as -0.5 W m-2 and -0.26 W m-2 respectively, at top of the atmosphere, which are higher than previously estimated by most models, but in reasonable agreement with a recent constrained modeling study.",

            "abstract": "Couplings between large and small scales in solar wind turbulence are further complicated by the expansion, which acts at all scales and directly influences the particle thermodynamics. We present 2-D hybrid simulations of kinetic turbulence, including the effects of radial expansion by means of the hybrid expanding model (HEB). We investigate properties of the cascade first in standard hybrid simulations and then we analyze the effects of a slow expansion on the turbulent spectrum (spectral break, residual energy, cross-helicity). Incoherent spectra of balanced and inbalanced counter-propagating Alfvén waves are taken as initial conditions and the dependence on the plasma beta and the amplitude of fluctuations is investigated. We focus on the properties of the ion parallel and perpendicular heating driven by the turbulence, and on how this is modulated by the expansion. Turbulence shapes the properties of the plasma, generating local temperature anisotropy in the distribution functions, however the associated perpendicular heating and parallel cooling are not strong enough to counteract the expansion-driven anisotropic cooling. As a consequence, the plasma is driven towards the fire hose instability threshold with increasing heliocentric distance, in agreement with solar wind observations. Once the plasma enters into the fire hose unstable region, electromagnetic fluctuations driven by the ion temperature anisotropy are generated on top of the background turbulence. Despite the configuration of our simulations - out-of-plane mean magnetic field - which allows for the growth of only a subset of fire hose fluctuations, these waves are able to locally scatter the protons and partially reduce their unstable temperature anisotropy. Our findings show that kinetic instabilities driven by anisotropic distributions, like fire hose, can play a role also in turbulent and inhomogeneous plasmas, and suggest that these mechanisms are at work in the solar wind expansion.",

            "abstract": "The incidence of wildfires in the Arctic and subarctic is increasing; in boreal North America, for example, the burned area is expected to increase by 200- 300% over the next 50-100 years. In some cases, local and long-range smoke transported to the Arctic has already increased aerosol concentrations twofold, which previous studies suggest could have a large effect on cloud microphysics, lifetime, albedo, and precipitation. However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly understood, in part due to the confounding influence of varying meteorological and surface conditions. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic (the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites-B campaign (ARCTAS-B), the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC), and the First ISCCP Regional Experiment Arctic Clouds Experiment (FIRE.ACE)) to compare cloud microphysics in liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds sampled at similar temperature and pressure in the presence and absence of biomass burning smoke. Care is taken to place findings in context of meteorological conditions. Preliminary data from the ARCTAS-B campaign suggest a noticeable impact of smoke on cloud properties in the liquid phase, consistent with the Twomey effect (smaller cloud droplet radius), and greater liquid water path and estimated cloud optical depth. Continuing work involves using the combination of field cases and satellite data from MISR, MODIS, CALIPSO, and other sources to more fully characterize the impact of smoke on Arctic clouds.",

            "abstract": "Channel reaches dominated by debris flow scour and incision tend to greatly influence landscape form in steepland basins as they can account for >80% of channel length as well as the vast majority of valley network relief. While hillslope and fluvial transport models have been combined with digital topography to develop proxies for erosion rates, debris flow networks, despite their ubiquity, have not been exploited for this purpose. This represents a major gap in our current ability to estimate landscape erosion from digital elevation models. In order to bridge this gap, we apply a previously proposed empirical function (Stock et al., 2003) that describes the variation of valley slope with drainage area in fluvial and debris flow reaches of steepland channel networks. We use high-resolution 1m airborne laser altimetry data for several catchments across the Oregon Coast Range to explore variation in the model parameters, chiefly the rate with which concavity decreases in the upstream direction. Our analysis documents variations in model parameters that result from differences in network geometry, scale, lithology, and the pace of base level lowering. Finally, we propose a function that relates these parameters to erosion rates acquired via cosmogenic nuclides for numerous catchments in the Oregon Coast Range.",

            "abstract": "Mirror mode waves in the magnetosheath are typically observed in the form of non-periodic low frequency plasma oscillations, characterized by magnetic field magnitude alternating between two preferred values (high and low field level). This property of fully saturated mirror modes is often referred to as bi-stability in the literature. We investigated mirror structures of this form observed by Cluster spacecraft focusing on the width and and magnitude of the \"low field\" and \"high field\" areas. In a statistical study it was observed that the plasma in the high field areas is usually stable or marginally stable with respect to mirror instability, but plasma corresponding to the low field level is unstable. The relative width of the low and high field areas is thus proportional to the degree of instability of the plasma. This relationship appears to be a generalization of the previously described association between mirror mode shape and distance to mirror instability threshold, where mirror \"dips\" (localized drops in field magnitude) are favored in stable plasma, and mirror \"peaks\" (localized field increases) occur in unstable plasmas. The spatial scale and geometry of the structures has also been investigated and compared to mirror instability theory. It is shown that the areas of low magnetic field level and unstable plasma are usually comparable or smaller than the mirror mode wavelength, indicating fully saturated state where the mirror instability is no longer efficient.",

            "abstract": "Protons and alpha particles in the fast solar wind are only weakly collisional and exhibit a number of non-equilibrium features, including temperature anisotropies and relative drifts along the direction of the background magnetic field. Two mechanisms have been proposed for limiting differential flow between alpha particles and protons: plasma instabilities and the rotational force. Both mechanisms decelerate the alpha particles - for example, the Alfvén/ion-cyclotron and fast-magnetosonic/whistler instabilities limit the drift velocity to a value comparable to the Alfvén speed, which decreases with increasing heliocentric distance r. However, while plasma instabilities transform bulk-flow kinetic energy into heat and plasma waves, the rotational force does not.\nWe present an analytic expression for the rate Qflow at which energy is released when alpha particles are decelerated by instabilities. We find that Qflow becomes zero at a critical radius r=rcrit, where rcrit is between 1.5 AU and 2 AU in the fast solar wind in the ecliptic plane, and rcrit increases with increasing heliographic latitude. We show that instabilities control the deceleration of alpha particles at r<rcrit, and the rotational force controls the deceleration of alpha particles at r>rcrit. We compare the value of Qflow at r<rcrit with the empirical heating rates for protons and alpha particles deduced from in-situ measurements of fast-wind streams from the Helios and Ulysses spacecraft. We find that Qflow exceeds the empirical heating rate for alpha particles at r<1 AU.\nWe conclude that the continuous energy input from alpha-particle deceleration at r<rcrit makes a considerable contribution to the heating of the fast solar wind in addition to other local heating mechanisms such as the dissipation of waves and turbulence. We also discuss the implications of the alpha-particle drift for the azimuthal flow velocities of the ions and for the Parker spiral magnetic field.",

These pressures can be realized through the lens of water science, policy, geopolitics, food security, and even military conflicts. Combined with a boom in global population, these pressures provide wide-reaching problems that need to be addressed presently and in the future across many disciplines including the sciences, engineering, economics, and policy.\nThese issues lead to a complex system of problems that cannot be addressed without a multidisciplinary approach. As we enter a world where regions of water scarcity become the norm, water scientists and engineers need to be at the table - with experts in other fields - shaping solutions in the areas of policy, disaster response, and management.\nI will argue that, as early-career scientists, there are exciting new challenges that are open, or will be opening, to us as experts in our respective fields. I will also provide my insights and opinions as to what we can do to position ourselves to impact these issues.

            "abstract": "Tsunamis can generate gravity waves propagating upward through the atmosphere and induce total electron content (TEC) disturbances in the ionosphere. The wave propagation has been captured by waveform models, which are effective but lack physical consistency. For the first time, we have implemented tsunami-generated gravity waves into the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) to develop a fully physics-based three-dimensional model describing the upper atmosphere under the influence of tsunamis. The model takes tsunami wave characteristics, including the wave heights, wavelengths and propagation velocities at the ocean surface as input parameters and characterizes the ionosphere-thermosphere between altitudes 100km and 600km. The computational region and grid resolution in the horizontal direction can be specifically adjusted according to applications.\nAs an initial application and test case, we simulate the ionosphere-thermosphere above the US west coastal region where the tsunamis caused by the 2011 Tokohu earthquake arrived and caused disturbances in the ionosphere. To validate our modeling approach, the GITM-simulated TEC disturbances are compared with GPS-derived TEC measurements at multiple geographic locations. We envision that modeled and measured TEC perturbations could play a critical role in detecting and imaging the upper atmospheric signatures of natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Tree-ring based reconstructions of hydroclimatic variability are useful for water resource management. One of the challenges in generating reconstructions is assessing uncertainties and how they impact use in resource management. This project focuses on recent reconstructions of streamflow for the Upper Klamath River basin. The reconstructions provide several centuries of historical context to drought and hydroclimate variability found in the instrumental record of the past century. The quality of tree-ring reconstructions greatly depends on the quality and the availability of tree-ring data and the instrument records used for reconstruction calibration. This project focuses on the quality and potential uncertainty of instrumental records. A number of hydroclimate instrumental records are available in the Klamath River basin. Unfortunately these records have deficiencies. Complex basin hydrology and a long history of water use have made it difficult to estimate the river’s natural flow. This project develops a methodology to combine uncertainty from the instrumental record with uncertainty from tree-ring reconstructions. The result is a Monte Carlo method which considers complex and potential non-linear interactions. Probability distributions are created for each observation in the instrumental record. An algorithm independently designs, trains, and tests a tree-ring reconstruction for potential outcomes of the instrumental record’s distributions. Preliminary results give probability distributions for past streamflow events. These can be used for commonly applied drought analysis. This includes exceedance probabilities relative to instrumental record drought for single and multiple-year moving averages.",

            "abstract": "The coupling of glacial hydrology and sliding is a source of uncertainty for both ice flow modeling and prediction of future sea level rise. As basal sliding is required for a glacier to erode its bed, the spatial pattern of glacier sliding is also important for understanding alpine landscape evolution. We use multi-temporal WorldView satellite imagery (0.5 m pixel) to monitor the seasonal progression of glacier velocity across the terminal ~50 km2of Kennicott Glacier, Alaska. We employ the free image correlation software COSI-Corr to construct multiple velocity maps, using 2013 imagery with repeat times from 15 to 38 days. These short intervals between images allow us to analyze variations in glacier velocity over weekly to monthly timescales associated with hydrologically-induced basal sliding.\nBy assuming that spring (March-April) glacier velocity results solely from viscous deformation, we produce spatially distributed maps of glacier sliding speed by differencing summer and spring ice surface speeds. For a given time, a large portion of our study reach slides with roughly uniform speed, despite significant variation in deformation speed. This suggests that glacier flow models in which basal sliding is taken simply to scale as ice surface velocity are unfounded. The upglacier end of our study reach slides at speeds that vary through the summer, whereas the terminal reach slides at a steady speed. The proportion of glacier motion due to sliding increases dramatically moving downglacier, making basal sliding especially important in the terminal region.\nMany formulations express glacier sliding as a function of effective pressure (ice pressure minus water pressure). If such formulations are correct, effective pressure varies little over large areas or is averaged over lengthscales equivalent to ~10 glacier thicknesses. Also, effective pressure is steady in the terminal region through the summer. We explore existing sliding laws to find which best describes the observed spatiotemporal pattern of sliding.",

            "abstract": "The costly interactions between humans and natural fire regimes throughout California demonstrate the need to understand the uncertainties surrounding wildfire, especially in the face of a changing climate and expanding human communities. Although a number of statistical and process-based wildfire models exist for California, there is enormous uncertainty about the location and number of future fires. Models estimate an increase in fire occurrence between nine and fifty-three percent by the end of the century. Our goal is to assess the role of uncertainty in climate and anthropogenic influences on the state’s fire regime from 2000-2050. We develop an empirical model that integrates novel information about the distribution and characteristics of future plant communities without assuming a particular distribution, and improve on previous efforts by integrating dynamic estimates of population density at each forecast time step. Historically, we find that anthropogenic influences account for up to fifty percent of the total fire count, and that further housing development will incite or suppress additional fires according to their intensity. We also find that the total area burned is likely to increase but at a slower than historical rate. Previous findings of substantially increased numbers of fires may be tied to the assumption of static fuel loadings, and the use of proxy variables not relevant to plant community distributions. We also find considerable agreement between GFDL and PCM model A2 runs, with decreasing fire counts expected only in areas of coastal influence below San Francisco and above Los Angeles. Due to potential shifts in rainfall patterns, substantial uncertainty remains for the semiarid deserts of the inland south. The broad shifts of wildfire between California’s climatic regions forecast in this study point to dramatic shifts in the pressures plant and human communities will face by midcentury. The information provided by this study reduces the level of uncertainty surrounding the influence that natural and anthropogenic systems have on wildfire.",

This shape raises questions far beyond the obvious differences with the nuclei visited so far. We will explore the possible scenarios that may explain it. Whereas contact- binaries have been advocated for elongated nuclei (e.g., 19P/Borrelly and 103P/Hartley 2), the only unquestionable case remains that of 8P/Tuttle based on radar imaging (Harmon at al. 2010) and indirectly confirmed by HST observations (Lamy et al. 2008). However 8P originates from the Oort cloud where the collisional activity is essentially non-existent. A contact-binary among the Jupiter family comets (JFC) such as 67P would have profound implications since it must be primordial and the comet must have survived a possible history of collisions in the Kuiper belt. The present cumulative distribution function of size of nuclei of JFC comets indeed suggests a collisionally-relaxed population. Asymmetric erosion of an initially larger more regular body or even of a pre-existing contact binary will be studied in the framework of the past dynamical evolution of 67P (e.g., Groussin et al. 2007). Although unlikely, the scenario of a re-accumulated body following a catastrophic collision will be considered. Forthcoming images at higher spatial resolution with OSIRIS on the orbiter and CIVA and the lander will hopefully help deciphering the origin of the nucleus of 67P and restricting the number of possible scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Recalcitrant carbon (C) stored in soils plays a critical role in regulating climate change because of its huge amount and relatively low turnover rate. Positive priming effect by increased labile C inputs could lead to more recalcitrant C release to the atmosphere. However, the stabilization of the newly added labile C has received much less attention. As a result, the quantitative balance between the stabilization and priming and consequently changes in recalcitrant C are still unclear. In this study, incubation data of different soils (i.e., forest, grassland, cropland, and vertisol) with isotope-labeled labile substrate additions were collected. An alternative version of the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) with stabilization and positive priming effect was used to simulate the C dynamics during the incubation and then run forward for ten years. The results showed that at the end of incubation, an equivalent of 5.45 – 26.1% of added C was primed from the original SOM for the four soils. Meanwhile, 40.9 – 70.7% of added C was stabilized, leading to a net increase in recalcitrant C by an equivalent of 18.0 – 50.0% of added C. After running model for ten years, the recalcitrant C was greater with than without initial labile C addition by an equivalent of 33.0, 2.01, 21.6, and 0.62% of added C for the forest, grassland, cropland and vertisol, respectively. Our results suggest that stabilization overcompensates the C loss induced by positive priming effect, indicating that stimulated labile C input under CO2 enrichment may increase the recalcitrant C storage in soils, and consequently dampen the further increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. The results also suggest that both stabilization and positive priming effect may vary among ecosystems and with the type and amount of added substrates. To better quantify the net change in recalcitrant C and thus long-term soil C storage, comprehensive studies on the effects of soil type, added substrate type and amount on stabilization and priming effect are critically needed.",

            "abstract": "The Boise River Basin in southwest Idaho, USA contains three major reservoirs totaling nearly 1,000,000 acre-feet of storage capacity. The primary goals for water managers are water supply and flood protection. In terms of observed SWE at monitoring sites throughout the basin, water years 2012 and 2014 were similar and near normal. In WY 2014 inflows into the BRB reservoir system followed historic patterns and reservoir releases were ideally controlled for management goals. WY2012 however was warmer than average and the winter snowpack had uncharacteristically high melt susceptibility. Subsequent energy fluxes produced late winter inflows much higher than normally encountered. The uncharacteristic flow patterns and inability of traditional operational modeling tools to handle this situation challenged water managers. Through late March and early April 2012 near flood stage flows were pushed through the city of Boise in order to increase storage and prevent more catastrophic flooding. While in this case a greater catastrophe was narrowly averted, the shortcomings of the traditional modeling approaches taken by operational agencies were exposed. “Uncharacteristic” events such as these are becoming more and more frequent as the effects of climate change are realized. The need for modernized methods – ones based on the physical controlling processes rather than historic patterns – is imperative. This presentation outlines the latest developments in the application of a physically-based, high-resolution spatial snow model to aid operational water management decisions.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric sulfate aerosol (SSA) plays an important role in the earth climate system by reflecting solar radiation making it an attractive candidate in geoengineering to counter greenhouse warming. However, these planetary scales perturbations demand a priori understanding of SSA over a longer time period to resolve anthropogenic and natural perturbations to the delicate and thin layers- SSA and ozone layers. Here we present a quarter century high resolution seasonal record of SSA and its linkage to the ozone layer. Sulfate was extracted from a (1x1m) and 25m deep snow pit at the South Pole. The combination of cations, anions, O-triple isotopes and S-quadruple isotope measurements allowed us to deconvolve the oxidation history of SSA and tease out natural and anthropogenic components. The period (1980 to 2002) encompasses the largest volcanic eruptions of the century, El-Chichon, Pinatubo, Cerro Hudson and the three largest El-Nino Southern Oscillation events. The highest O-isotope anomaly (∆17O = 3.7‰) in SSA was observed during the super ENSO event (1997-98) and recorded changes in ozone levels of the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (\n1\n). ENSO is another flavor of natural climate variability and is important as it links hydrosphere and the atmosphere in unique ways controlling rainfall and temperature.\nThe highest S-isotope anomaly was observed in 1998-99 and records changes in atmospheric dynamics and transport of sulfur compounds to the stratosphere following intense wild fires as a consequence of the Super ENSO event. The highest S-isotopic anomaly (∆33S = +2.26‰ and ∆36S= +0.51 ‰) is ~ 3 times higher compared to the Pinatubo signal, the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. The pattern of S-isotope anomalies in this period fits within the pre-Cambrian record of S-isotopes in three billion year old rock. The generation of such a large S-isotope anomaly in the present day oxygen rich atmosphere may have implications for the interpretation of Archean sulfate deposits(2). Our high resolution record of S-isotope anomaly in a volcanically quiescent and non ENSO time period (∆36S= −0.6 ± 0.2‰) indicates ~ 12 gigatonne transport of tropospheric S to the stratosphere and may have implications for understanding of global warming hiatus reported to be associated with the ENSO events (3).",

            "abstract": "Measurements of the azimuthal magnetic field component, BΦ, enable the study of the sub-corotating magnetosphere, the associated global current system, the ionospheric Pedersen current, IP, and a comparison with the Cowley-Vasyliunas model. The study is strongly dependent on Cassini’s highly elliptical orbits that restrict useful observations to specific orbits and parts of orbits to avoid weak azimuthal fields associated with the magnetopause or other magnetospheric currents. An example is the selection of thirteen identical orbits near 22 +/- 2 hours Local Time and restriction of the data to 4 to 10 Saturn radii. Inferred IP profiles between 10° and 25° ionospheric co-latitude, θi , when averaged, are similar in shape to model predictions with a peak value of 5 million amperes. However, the individual profiles vary significantly, the result of dynamics associated with large-scale motions of the magnetospheric field. The Cowley-Vasyliunas model also relates IP(θi) to magnetospheric rotation rates, ΩS, equivalent to the SKR period, and the sub-corotation rate, ω, and provides a means of estimating ω / ΩS in the night-side magnetosphere as compared to the dayside rotation rates obtained from azimuthal plasma velocity measurements, VΦ. Other carefully- selected orbits extend these results to different ranges in θi and Local Times and provide further values of important magnetospheric parameters and allow additional testing of the model.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructing the timing and nature of past changes in aquatic productivity in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) can shed light on the primary processes driving biogeochemical cycling over geologic timescales. Here, we present sedimentologic, physical property, stable isotope, and biogenic opal concentration data from IODP Expedition 341 Sites U1417 and U1419 and identify intervals where diatom ooze lithofacies and geochemical evidence for increased algal productivity are prevalent during the Pleistocene. Sites U1417 and U1419 are located in the center and the margin of the Fe-limited GoA, respectively, and they offer the potential to characterize past changes in biogeochemical cycling during different Pleistocene time intervals.\nSite U1419 cores were collected from a small slope basin at the edge of the continental shelf. Sediment cores reveal two prominent ~6-m-thick intervals of diatomaceous ooze. Between these intervals are numerous 20-cm-thick sections of biogenic-rich sediment, interbedded with gray mud that commonly contains lonestones. Based on preliminary age models, the two diatom ooze intervals likely correspond to the Holocene and MIS 3, while the intervening interbedded glacigenic and biogenic sediment can broadly be ascribed to MIS 2. Diatomaceous ooze and diatom-rich sediments are generally characterized by lower magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma ray, bulk density, and higher b* color reflectance. Initial C & N concentration and stable isotopic data show elevated concentrations and more positive stable isotope values during the Holocene and MIS 3, which approximate the isotopic signature of modern phytoplankton measured in the GoA. Within the glacial period, the biogenic-rich intervals are also characterized by more positive C and N isotopic values. When combined with the shipboard physical property data, the stable isotopic results are indicative of millennial-scale variations in productivity and/or changes in glacial ice extent in the GoA during the last glacial period. We will discuss these results in the context of an improved isotope stratigraphy and ongoing work examining multiple interglacial productivity variations at Site U1417.",

Students play the role of mission scientists for a NASA rover mission, tasked with targeting the rover’s scientific instruments to investigate a specific scientific question about the landing site. As with the real mission, the student operators must optimize the efficient use of limited resources and time against the need to make observations to address working hypotheses. The activity uses only real--not artificial or simulated--mission data, and students are guided throughout by a “Mission Manager” who provides hints and advice about the scientific meaning of observations within the broader context of the mission objectives. The MER Opportunity EVFE is a pilot effort, the first of five EVFE modules planned a rate of one per year that will feature different NASA missions and scientific topics. The MER Opportunity EVFE has already been developed and focuses on the investigation of the history of water on Mars at the Meridiani landing site of the Opportunity rover.

            "abstract": "The Alaskan region has historically been a sink of atmospheric CO2, but permafrost currently stores large amounts of carbon that are vulnerable to release to the atmosphere as northern high-latitudes continue to warm faster than the global average. We use aircraft CO2 data with a remote-sensing based model driven by MODIS satellite products and validated by CO2 flux tower data to calculate average daily CO2 fluxes for the region of Alaska during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013. Atmospheric trace gases were measured during CARVE (Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment) aboard the NASA Sherpa C-23 aircraft. For profiles along the flight track, we couple the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, and convolve these footprints of surface influence with our remote-sensing based model, the Polar Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model (PolarVPRM). We are able to calculate average regional fluxes for each month by minimizing the difference between the data and model column integrals. Our results provide a snapshot of the current state of regional Alaskan growing season net ecosystem exchange (NEE). We are able to begin characterizing the interannual variation in Alaskan NEE and to inform future refinements in process-based modeling that will produce better estimates of past, present, and future pan-Arctic NEE.

Coronae are ~200 km wide, and are surrounded by concentric, sub-parrallel lineations, that have been interpreted as extensional tectonic and volcanic landforms.\nHere we test the hypothesis coronae formed as a result of convection in Miranda’s ice mantle during an episode of tidal heating. Using numerical models of spherical convection, we show that if Miranda’s surface is weak, sluggish lid convection can occur, which simultaneously generates the concentric deformation patterns observed in the coronae, the inferred thermal gradient predicted by models of flexure, and the approximate number of plumes necessary to form the coronae.\nWe have tested the influence of core size on convection geometry. For basal Rayleigh numbers between 10^5 and 10^8, and for effective viscosity contrasts less than 10^4, we found that low-order convection patterns only remain stable for core radii less than half the satellite radius. This suggests that low-order convection patterns may be more likely to develop in planets and satellites with small cores, however we find that the distribution of tidal heating within icy satellites also strongly influences convection geometry.",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) provide an historic opportunity to significantly improve Earth and space science (ESS) education nationally at the K-12 level. The increased emphasis on ESS related topics in the NGSS relative to previous standards provides a real opportunity for ensuring all K-12 students in adopting states learn about the ESS - allowing us to reach many more students than are currently are exposed to our discipline. The new standards are also exciting in that they explicitly couple science and engineering practice, cross-cutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas in such a way that student must actively demonstrate their understanding through actions rather than through mere regurgitation of memorized responses. Achieving mastery of NGSS Performance Expectations will require practice with higher-order learning skills - with students engaging in the practices of scientists and engineers. Preparing students for this mastery will be a challenging task for teachers, since in many states professional development support is limited at best for the current curriculum - let alone the curricula that will be developed to address the NGSS. As adoption of the NGSS expands across the country, states will be at various levels of implementation of the new standards over the next several years - and there is real concern that teachers must have sufficient professional development to be able to be successful in preparing their students - particularly in view of likely coupled assessments and teacher evaluations. NESTA strongly supports implementation of the NGSS, and the rigorous and compelling ESS education it will engender, when coupled with a strong emphasis nationwide on teacher professional development. For the past two years, the National Earth Science Teachers Association (NESTA) has continued our leadership in K-12 ESS education through workshops, web seminars, events and publications that emphasize implementation of the NGSS in ESS-related courses. Our recent survey of K-12 Earth and space science educators confirms widespread enthusiasm about the potential offered by the new standards, as well as concern about the urgent need for professional development to support teacher implementation of the standards.",

            "abstract": "In a landmark paper a quarter of a century ago, Nolet (1990) applied his newly developed method, Partitioned Waveform Inversion (PWI), to data from a new broadband array in Europe, the Network of Autonomously Recording Seismographs (NARS). The deployment of NARS was followed by deployments of numerous other arrays, resulting in an explosive growth in the amount of broadband data worldwide. The PWI method, in turn, has proven to be extremely effective in utilizing the growing data volumes. Over the last 20+ years, it has yielded a steady stream of discoveries on the Earth’s structure and dynamics.\nPWI extracts information on Earth structure from both surface and body waves within full seismic waveforms, putting this information in the form of linear equations with uncorrelated uncertainties. Early on, PWI has been applied successfully at the continental scale for upper-mantle tomography, at the regional scale for Moho-depth mapping, and even at the local scale for imaging shallow marine sediments. Automated multimode inversion developed on the basis of PWI has taken the method to global applications, and today it has been applied to millions of seismograms (all broadband data available from international data centers).\nWaveform tomography stemming from the work of Nolet (1990) now reveals the global structure and anisotropy of the upper mantle in great detail. It provides regional resolution (at the scale of tectonic units) in many regions that are well-sampled by the data. Beneath Tibet, for example, complex subduction of the cold, high-velocity Indian lithosphere is imaged in detail in the upper mantle, while azimuthal anisotropy resolved within the crust shows the flow that accommodates the India-Asia lithospheric convergence. At greater depths, in the mantle transition zone, a belt of high-velocity anomalies reveals subducted lithospheric fragments along the entire Tethys convergence zone. Globally, waveform tomography enables us to examine the heterogeneity of the lithosphere and underlying mantle from different perspectives: multimode surface-wave dispersion, shear-velocity tomography, and tectonic regionalization.\nNolet, G., 1990.

            "abstract": "Point source emissions from power plants and non-erupting active volcanoes are continuous but variable in source strength and resulting plume direction. Power plant emission variations are driven by regular demand/load cycles, while volcanic CO2 emissions follow less regular oscillations. Two polar orbiting sun-synchronous satellites currently measure atmospheric CO2with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution to detect point sources and their plumes: GOSAT and OCO-2.\nGOSAT, launched in January 2009 by JAXA, provides 260 km spaced single-sounding grid points at a 3-day repeat cycle with a circular field of view of 10km diameter, at ~0.25/s samples. OCO-2 (leading the A-train on the Calipso ground track, repeat cycle 16 days), launched in July 2014 by NASA continuously collects eight <3 km2 cross-track elements at 24/s samples along a ~10 km wide swath either along-track (nadir), or in glint direction. GOSAT has an agile pointing system, permitting a large number of custom targets per orbit, at the expense of spatial context. OCO-2 provides up to 10,000 soundings over a different pre-programmed ~100 km2area each day. Consequently, observation strategies for point sources differ between the two missions. GOSAT can precisely and frequently and repeatedly target at the central emission point, providing a great opportunity for time series observations at its fast repeat cycle. In contrast, OCO-2 is targeting mainly validation sites (maximum 1 per orbit), thus maximizing spatial data continuity. However, close incidental flyby detection of plumes, with some along-swath spatial context, is possible with OCO-2.\nSynergetic opportunities exist to aid in CO2 plume identification, verification and validation. For OCO-2, other A-Train constellation satellites (e.g., OMI, MODIS, Calipso) provide independent parameters such as SO2 and aerosol information. GOSAT TIR data can be used to retrieve SO2values, providing plume validation, together with the GOSAT’s spatial aerosols data. GOSAT and OCO-2 offer synergies between each other through several near-coincident measurements per day, permitting direct cross-validation, as well as making use of the combination of incidental OCO-2 flybys at point sources and their plumes, and target mode time series from GOSAT.\n© 2013 California Institute of Technology",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow in the upper crust is controlled by the permeability and interconnection of fractures in the fault zones. The permeability within the fault zone is determined by its activity, architecture and, in particular, by the mineralogy of the core and the damage zone. Whereas the permeability structure of a fault zone can be defined by the volume proportion of the core with respect to the damage zone, the relationship between the mineralogy and permeability along fault zones still remains obscure. This work examines structural and mineralogical data to show the relationship between the mineral composition of the fault zone with its permeability in the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS) and the Arc-oblique Long-lived Fault Systems (ALFS), Southern Chile. The LOFS is an active ca. 1200 km long strike-slip Cenozoic intra-arc structure that strikes NNE in its master traces and NE in its subsidiary traces, with dextral and dextral-normal movement mostly developed in the last 6 My. Although the LOFS and the ALFS cross-cut each other, the ALFS is an apparently older basement fault system where seismic and field evidences record sinistral, sinistral-normal and sinistral-reverse movements. One 22-m-long NE transect was mapped orthogonal to a segment of the ALFS, where host rocks are Miocene andesitic rocks. Structural and XRD sampling were conducted in the core and damage zone. Structural mapping shows a multiple core, NW-striking fault zone with foliated gouge and an asymmetric damage zone, where the hanging wall has significantly higher mesoscopic fracture density than the footwall. The hanging wall is characterized by NW-striking, steeply dipping veins. Preliminary XRD results indicate the presence of homogenously distributed Ca-rich zeolite (mainly laumontite) in the core and the veins of the damage zone, which could indicate that the core acted as a conduit for low-temperature (ca. 220°C) fluids.",

            "abstract": "International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 349 cored Site U1435 on a structural high along the northern continent/ocean boundary in the East Subbasin of the South China Sea. At this site, thin Neogene and Quaternary sediment cover (~35 m thick) characterized by clays and manganese nodules is underlain by ~40 m of Oligocene deep marine nannofossil-rich clay and claystone. Calcareous nannofossils are abundant and moderately to well preserved throughout much of the Oligocene sequence, although their overall abundance decreases near the base of the unit. The diverse assemblage is characterized by abundant reticulofenestrids, common Cyclicargolithus floridanus, Cyclicargolithus abisectus, and Zygrhablithus bijugatus, with fewer numbers of species belonging to the genera Coccolithus, Discoaster, and Helicosphaera. The presence of well-preserved sphenoliths allows for good biostratigraphic control through the section, which we correlate to nannofossil Zones NP21 to NP25. The base of the sequence in Section 349-U1435A-9R-2 is dated to between 32.92 and 33.43 Ma based on the presence of Coccolithus formosus and absence of abundant Clausicoccus distichus. The Oligocene section at Site U1435 unconformably overlies a unit comprised dominantly of sandstone of unknown age due to a paucity of calcareous and siliceous planktonic marine microfossils. The presence of brackish water benthic foraminifers in some samples suggests a nearshore environment of deposition, substantially different from the deepwater (>2500 m) environment inferred for the Oligocene rocks based on the trace fossil assemblage. We infer that the abrupt transition from shallow to deepwater facies at this site represents the breakup unconformity for the initial opening of the South China Sea, indicating that seafloor spreading began at ~33 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Fault zones and fault-related permeability structures have long been recognized to play a first-order role on fluid flow migration through the crust. However, the nature of the spatial relationship between fault zones and fluid-flow and the evolution of such permeability structures in terms of paleofluid flow quantification is less well understood. This work presents a microfracture analysis aimed to unravel the nature of the fault plumbing system and estimate paleo permeability parameters within the Jorgillo Fault (JF), a subvertical strike-slip fault exposed in the Atacama Fault System in northern Chile. The JF is a ca. 18 km long, NNW striking strike-slip fault with sinistral horizontal separation of ca. 4 km. The JF juxtaposes orthogranulites to the west (JFW) with gabbros to the east side (JFE) wherea 200 m fault-perpendicular transect was mapped and sampled. The fault core consists of ca. 1 m cataclasite bounded by fault gouge zones of ca. 80 cm to the west and 30 cm to the east. A ca. 50 m wide symmetrical damage zone can be observed at field scale. The damage zone in the JFW is characterized by shear fractures and cataclasites whereas the JFE consists of open fractures and veins. The JFW microfracture analysis reveal mm-wide cataclasitic/ultracataclasitic bands orientated subparallel to the JF, calcite veins in a T-fracture orientation, and minor polydirectional chlorite veins. In the JFE, 1-20 mm wide chlorite, quartz-epidote and quartz-calcite veins, can be observed. Chlorite conjugate veins show syntaxial growth textures suggesting dilatational fracturing. Microfractures distribution show shear fractures distributed only in JFW while open fractures are mainly in the JFE. Using models off paleofluid flow, cumulative permeability (i.e. permeability due to all types of microfractures present in the samples) was estimated to range from 2.761x10-11 to 4.89x10-9 m2 on the JFE, and 8.04x10-12 to 4.39x10-8 m2 on the JFW.",

The process of wave breaking, either in deep or shallow waters, is followed by injection of turbulent kinetic energy into the underlying water column. This process modifies momentum eddy viscosity and tracer mixing properties. In this research we employed different two-equation one-dimensional vertical turbulence models to study breaking wave-induced turbulence for white-capping and depth-limited breaking cases. We used recent turbulence dissipation rate measurements using wave-following 'SWIFT' drifters at New River Inlet, North Carolina to verify the models. We improved our fully coupled 3D ocean-wave modelling system with new turbulence parameters and showed how the new turbulence characterizations could affect stratification and other plume properties in New River Inlet application.",

Prior studies have also shown that stratospheric water vapor has a small but non-negligible effect on global radiative forcing; therefore it is key to understand both trends and long-term variations. In this presentation, we will examine both the relationship between tropical tropopause temperatures and stratospheric water for the time period where we have global lower stratosphere water vapor measurements (primarily since the early 1990s), as well as the relationship between tropical tropopause temperatures and assorted atmospheric indices for the longer time period where we only have temperature measurements.

            "abstract": "Measuring the draw down of carbonyl sulfide (chemical formula: COS) over ecosystems can provide a new tool for estimating gross primary production (GPP) at important temporal and spatial scales. COS is a gas ubiquitous in the atmosphere that shares many characteristics with CO2: both are taken up by enzymes in plant leaves at a predictable ratio and in proportion to their ambient concentrations. While CO2 is simultaneously respired by soil and plant roots, the dominant flux of COS is foliar absorption. Previously, ecosystem soil fluxes of COS were thought to be negligible in the application of this COS-GPP proxy. Here we present new data describing controls on soil fluxes as a way to anticipate COS soil exchange over heterogeneous landscapes. Using soil samples from two agricultural sites in the Great Plains and one site in the Colorado Desert, we captured data from the extremes of ecosystem GPP in the United States. We then built a model describing COS soil fluxes with inputs of soil temperature and soil water content based on characterized soil behavior. This study provides an essential refinement in applying COS-GPP estimates over the continents.",

We related the compositional change to a transient modification of the convergent margin system, where and extensional roll-back related configuration or the subduction of an oceanic ridge allows the flux of the astenospheric mantle.\nThis continental magmatic arc was subsequently deformed due to the collision and accretion of an allocthonous oceanic arc that migrate from the southeast Pacific at the beginning of the Andean orogeny.",

The current system develops and evolves along the ionospheric terminator and it is thus termed as the terminator field-aligned currents.

In this presentation, we show the results of a follow-on study using the IDED-DA, in which the solar, seasonal, and geomagnetic dependencies of the terminator field-aligned currents are explored. The new current system is the first field-aligned current system in the high-latitude ionosphere that is not directly driven by the magnetospheric dynamics and has an ionospheric origin. A systematic study of its electrodynamic and plasma dynamics as well as dependencies on various solar-terrestrial conditions will help us to explore the active role of the ionosphere in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and improve the physical understanding of the electrodynamics and plasma dynamics of many small-scale structures in the polar ionosphere.

            "abstract": "All ecosystems will be impacted to some extent by climate change, with forecasts for more frequent and severe drought likely to have the greatest impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems are known to vary dramatically in their responses to drought. However, the factors that may make some ecosystems respond more or less than others remains unknown, but such understanding is critical for predicting drought impacts at regional and continental scales. To effectively forecast terrestrial ecosystem responses to drought, ecologists must assess responses of a range of different ecosystems to drought, and then improve existing models by incorporating the factors that cause such variation in response. Traditional site-based research cannot provide this knowledge because experiments conducted at individual sites are often not directly comparable due to differences in methodologies employed. Coordinated experimental networks, with identical protocols and comparable measurements, are ideally suited for comparative studies at regional to global scales. The US National Science Foundation-funded Drought-Net Research Coordination Network (\nwww.drought-net.org\n) will advance understanding of the determinants of terrestrial ecosystem responses to drought by bringing together an international group of scientists to conduct two key activities conducted over the next five years: 1) planning and coordinating new research using standardized measurements to leverage the value of existing drought experiments across the globe (Enhancing Existing Experiments, EEE), and 2) finalizing the design and facilitating the establishment of a new international network of coordinated drought experiments (the International Drought Experiment, IDE). The primary goals of these activities are to assess: (1) patterns of differential terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to drought and (2) potential mechanisms underlying those patterns.",

We rely on study of such deposits to better understand the underlying magma bodies and their eruptions.\nWe are studying several deposits: Bishop Tuff (BT, CA USA), Peach Spring Tuff (PST, SW USA), and Oruanui Tuff (OT, NZ). We combine quantitative textural characterization in 3D via x-ray tomography (XRT), focusing particularly on CSDs of major and accessory minerals; characterization of mineral zoning, particularly of Ti and CL in quartz, including inferences from diffusion chronometry; documentation of glass inclusion textures in 3D via XRT, with implications to crystallization timescales; and phase equilibria modeling (rhyolite-MELTS), including glass (inclusion and matrix) composition geobarometry, to constrain crystallization conditions.\nCSDs ubiquitously record a growth-dominated regime, characterized by limited nucleation, consistent with pre-eruptive crystallization under low supersaturation. Phenocryst interiors are largely unzoned, consistent with phase equilibria predictions of nearly invariant, effectively isothermal crystallization. Glass compositions record storage over a large spread of depths (~125-250 MPa) for early and late-erupted BT, while the OT represents multiple magma batches evacuated from different depths. Diffusion chronometry and melt inclusion faceting suggest pre-eruptive crystallization over centennial timescales.\nCSDs and mineral textures also record syn-eruptive crystallization, which results in huge numbers of small crystals, revealing extensive nucleation prior to eruption. Crystal rims develop on pre-existing phenocrysts, and they can be obvious if compositionally distinct from interiors (BT and PST). In PST, evidence for rim crystallization from hotter magma is very strong. BT contrasts with PST in many ways; evidence for heating is ambiguous, and pumice properties are difficult to reconcile with magma mixing, while the effects of growth rate and decompression are underappreciated. Diffusion chronometry indicates rim crystallization over the final year prior to eruption, under high supersaturation, during eruptive decompression; this reveals the timeframe over which signs of an impending supereruption may be felt at the surface.",

Here we discuss needed next steps to provide consistently described and formatted ecological data for immediate application in ecological analysis, focusing on integrating phenology, trait and environmental data to understand local to continental-scale biophysical processes and inform natural resource management practices. As more sources of data become available at finer spatial and temporal resolution, e.g., from national standardized earth observing systems (e.g., NEON, LTER and LTAR Networks, USA NPN), these challenges will become more acute. Here we provide an overview of the standards and ontology development landscape specifically related to phenological and trait data, and identify requirements to overcome current challenges. Second, we outline a workflow for formatting and integrating existing datasets to address key scientific and resource management questions such as: “What traits determine differential phenological responses to changing environmental conditions?” or “What is the role of granularity of observation, and of spatiotemporal scale, in controlling phenological responses to different driving variables?” Third, we discuss methods to semantically annotate datasets to greatly decrease time needed to assemble heterogeneous data for use in ecological analyses on varying spatial scales. We close by making a call to interested community members for a working group to model phenology, trait and environmental data products from continental-scale efforts (e.g. NEON, USA-NPN and others) focusing on ways to assure discoverability and interoperability.",

            "abstract": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is a key process for the transport of solar wind plasma across the Earth’s magnetopause. When both magnetic and velocity shears coexists within a boundary as commonly seen at the magnetopause, the resulting KHI leads to generation of vortices and subsequent triggering of magnetic reconnection. Our recent 3D fully kinetic simulations of this process for symmetric boundary layers demonstrated the copious formation of oblique flux ropes, which leads to a rapid mixing of the plasma within the vortex layer. THEMIS observations at the dusk-flank magnetopause indeed show similar features of flux ropes between observed KH vortices. More recently, we performed additional 3D fully kinetic simulations considering the effects of density and temperature asymmetries, which also commonly exist across the magnetopause. Past 2D simulations have shown that such asymmetries can lead to an excitation of secondary instabilities along the edge of the vortex in the absence of a finite magnetic field component (B//) parallel to the k-vector of the KHI. Since B// is expected to be finite at the magnetopause, here we explore the effect of B// on secondary instabilities in 3D. We find that the suppression of the secondary instabilities due to B// is an artifact of the 2D simulations, whereas in 3D the instabilities can grow over a range of oblique angles even when there is a finite B//. These secondary instabilities give rise to turbulence, which transports the solar wind plasma originally stored within the flow vortices deep into the magnetosphere. Simple estimates suggest that the reconnection-induced rapid mixing and the turbulent-induced transport processes may contribute significantly to the formation of the Earth’s low-latitude boundary layer and the cold-dense plasma sheet during prolonged periods of northward IMF.",

            "abstract": "Understanding critical processes that contribute to the organization of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is important for accurate weather forecasts and climate model parameterization development. In this study, we investigate the effects of wind shear at different vertical levels on the organization and properties of cloud systems using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with spectral-bin microphysics. Based on a control run for an MCS with weak wind shear, we find that increasing wind shear at the both lower (0-5 km) and middle vertical levels (5-10 km) reduces accumulated precipitation and occurrence of heavy rain, while increasing wind shear at the upper levels (> 10 km) leads to small changes in precipitation. Although increasing wind shear at the lower-levels is favorable for a more organized quasi-line system, the precipitation is still reduced by 18.6% compared with the control run due to stronger rain evaporation. Strong wind shear in the middle vertical levels produces a strong super-cell over a narrow area, leading to 67.3% reduction of domain mean precipitation. Increasing wind shear at the upper levels only, does not significantly change the organization of the convection, but it increases cloudiness at the upper-levels which in turn leads to stronger surface cooling, which then stabilizes the atmosphere and weakens convection. When strong wind shear exists over the entire vertical profile, a deep dry layer (from 2 to 9 km) is produced and convection is severely suppressed, leading to fewer high and deep clouds, and the precipitation is reduced by up to 90% in comparison to the control run. The changes in cloud microphysical properties further explain the reduction of surface rain by strong wind shear especially at the lower- and middle-levels. The insights obtained from this study help us better understand the cloud system organization and provide a foundation for improved parameterization of the effect of organized MCS on large-scale circulation.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of lithium (δ7Li) is recognized to be an excellent proxy of near-surface fluid-rock reactions during weathering. Using Li as a tracer of these processes however requires constraints on the average Li composition of terrestrial reservoirs, in particular that of the upper continental crust. To date, only one value for the average δ7Li value of the upper continental crust, derived from periglacial loess, shales, and granites is available in the literature (7δLi = 0 ± 4 (2σ), Teng et al., 2004). Several values exist for the average [Li] of the upper crust, but they differ by more than 30%. We measured the Li isotopic composition of about 30 desert and periglacial loess (unweathered windblown sediments) from several parts of the world (Europe, Argentina, China and Tajikistan). We demonstrate that desert loess, which is more homogeneous and representative of larger portions of the Earth's surface, provides a better proxy for the average composition of the upper continental crust compared to periglacial loess. The Li isotopic compositions and concentrations of desert loess are controlled by eolian sorting, which can be quantified as a binary isotopic mixing between a weathered fine-grained end-member and an unweathered coarse-grained end-member. Using correlations between Li isotopic compositions, Li concentrations and trace element concentrations in desert loess, we estimate new average values for the upper continental crust: 1 ± 2 (2σ); [Li] = 35.3 ± 4.6 (2σ) ppm. This δ7Li value is slightly higher than that previously published in Teng et al. (2004), but overlaps within uncertainty, whereas the [Li] is identical to that of Teng et al. (2004: 35 ± 11, 2σ); both new estimates have lower uncertainty. Our new estimate of [Li], along with that of Teng et al. (2004), are higher than all previous estimates for the upper continental crust, raising the question as to whether the average concentrations of other mobile alkali metals such as cesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb) may have also been underestimated in previous studies.",

            "abstract": "GIS and geological modeling software have radically changed the means by which geological mapping is produced, published and visualized. This type of software environment normally requires a spatially aware reference system to position data and interpretation, often referred as georeferenced data (i.e. geographic data referenced on the Earth). However, for this study we coin the term areoreferenced data (i.e. Mars-referenced \"geographic\" data). Thanks to the wealth of areoreferenced data made available by the NASA and the HiRise at University of Arizona it is now possible to carry out 3D areographic and areologic (i.e. related to the topography and geology of Mars, respectively) reconstructions in great detail. The present work benefits from the availability of software and areographic data, and presents the results of an areologic map and 3D model of the fault systems in the Meridiani Planum of Mars. The work has been carried out in Move™ (developed by Midland Valley Exploration), a geological modeling toolkit that allows for easy data loading in a wide range of formats as well as straightforward 2D/3D model building tools of geological bodies. Initial data consisted of Digital Terrain Model and orthoimages (NASA/JPL/University of Arizona/USGS). From these we have interpreted several structural domains: right-lateral strike-slip systems with associated releasing bends, which gave room to an extensional event causing a horizontal-axis rotation of the bedding. Bedding ranges from subhorizontal in the southern domain where strike-slip prevails to nearly 40º in the central and northern domains, where a more complex interaction between strike-slip and extensional faults is described. The stratigraphic sequence is mainly composed by moderately rounded well laminated basaltic sandstones (Squyres et al., 2004) in which a high component of sulfurs (e.g. sulfate anhydrate, hexahydrite, epsomite, gypsum) and salts (e.g. halite) has been described (Squyres et al., 2004; Christensen et al., 2004). This presence of sulfurs and salts do not only evidence the presence of water in Mars in the past, but also makes us consider the presence of deeper layers that may constitute potential décollement levels on which the faults detach, as it has been described in extensional and compressional cordilleras elsewhere in the Earth.",

            "abstract": "In order to constrain the effects of vapor wall deposition on measured secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields in laboratory chambers, Zhang et al. (2014) varied the seed aerosol surface area in toluene oxidation and observed a clear increase in the SOA yield with increasing seed surface area. Using a coupled vapor-particle dynamics model, we examine the extent to which this increase is the result of vapor wall deposition versus kinetic limitations arising from imperfect accommodation of organic species into the particle phase. We show that a seed surface area dependence of the SOA yield is present only when condensation of vapors onto particles is kinetically limited. The existence of kinetic limitation can be predicted by comparing the characteristic timescales of gas-phase reaction, vapor wall deposition, and gas-particle equilibration. The gas-particle equilibration timescale depends on the gas-particle accommodation coefficient αp. Regardless of the extent of kinetic limitation, vapor wall deposition depresses the SOA yield from that in its absence since vapor molecules that might otherwise condense on particles deposit on the walls. To accurately extrapolate chamber-derived yields to atmospheric conditions, both vapor wall deposition and kinetic limitations must be taken into account.",

The present system includes 1) the mesoscale meteorological model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting); 2) the regional-domain FVCOM covering the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank/New England Shelf region (GOM-FVCOM); 3) the unstructured-grid surface wave model (FVCOM-SWAVE) modified from SWAN with the same domain as GOM-FVCOM; 3) the Mass coastal FVCOM with inclusion of inlets, estuaries and intertidal wetlands; and 4) three subdomain wave-current coupled inundation FVCOM systems in Scituate, MA, Hampton River, NH and Mass Bay, MA. GOM-FVCOM grid features unstructured triangular meshes with horizontal resolution of ~ 0.3-25 km and a hybrid terrain-following vertical coordinate with a total of 45 layers. The Mass coastal FVCOM grid is configured with triangular meshes with horizontal resolution up to ~10 m, and 10 layers in the vertical. Scituate, Hampton River and Mass Bay inundation model grids include both water and land with horizontal resolution up to ~5-10 m and 10 vertical layers. GOM-FVCOM is driven by surface forcing from WRF model output configured for the region (with 9-km resolution), the COARE3 bulk air-sea flux algorithm, local river discharges, and tidal forcing constructed by eight constituents and subtidal forcing on the boundary nested to the Global-FVCOM. SWAVE is driven by the same WRF wind field with wave forcing at the boundary nested to Wave Watch III configured for the northwestern Atlantic region. The Mass coastal FVCOM and three inundation models are connected with GOM-FVCOM through one-way nesting in the common boundary zones. The Mass coastal FVCOM is driven by the same surface forcing as GOM-FVCOM. The nesting boundary conditions for the inundation models include both hydrodynamics and waves provided by GOM-FVCOM and SWAVE.

            "abstract": "The role of dynamic storage in catchment discharge response to earlier snowmelt timing has not been fully quantified. Green Lake 4 (GL4) and Emerald Lake Watershed (ELW) have similar high-elevation settings but GL4 has greater estimated storage capacity relative to ELW due to differences in physical structure. Daily catchment area-normalized input (modelled snowmelt estimates) and output (measured discharge) in conjunction with mineral weathering products (hydrochemical data) for eleven snowmelt seasons from GL4 (more storage) and ELW (less storage) were used to determine the role of dynamic storage at the catchment scale. Daily fluxes generally show snowmelt is greater than discharge initially, changing mid-season to discharge being greater than snowmelt, creating a counter-clockwise hysteresis loop for each snowmelt season. This hysteresis loop can be approximated with a least-squares fitted ellipse. The properties of fitted ellipses were used to quantify catchment response, which were then compared between catchments with different storage capacities (GL4 and ELW). The eccentricity of the fitted ellipses can be used to quantify delay between snowmelt and discharge due to connection to subsurface storage; narrower loops show minimal storage delay whereas wider loops show greater storage delay. Variability of mineral weathering products shows changes in contribution from stored water over the snowmelt season. Both catchments show a moderate linear correlation between fitted ellipse area and total snowmelt volume (GL4 R2=0.516, ELW R2=0.614). Ellipse eccentricity is more consistent among years in ELW (range=0.81-0.94) than in GL4 (range=0.54-0.95), indicating a more consistent hydrologic structure and connectivity to shallow storage at ELW. The linear correlation between seasonal eccentricity versus snowmelt timing is stronger in ELW than GL4 (R2=0.741 and 0.223, respectively). ELW shows hydrochemical response independent of snowmelt timing, whereas GL4 shows more variability. The larger storage capacity of GL4 allows for a greater range of physical and chemical response to input conditions. The limited storage capacity of ELW shows greater vulnerability of physical response to changes in snowmelt conditions, though chemical response remains constant regardless of snowmelt conditions.",

These regolith samples, like those returned by the JAXA Hayabusa mission from Itokawa, will likely exhibit some modification by space weathering (SW). Further, these samples may contain up to ~5% organic carbon, mainly in the form of macromolecular carbon (MMC). MMC in meteorites can be studied with Raman spectroscopy; changes in its Raman spectral parameters have been shown to correlate with the petrographic grade of the meteorite. But these petrographic studies are calibrated with internal pieces of meteorite samples, so the MMC seen in meteorites has not experienced SW. Hence, it is important to determine the effects of SW may have on the MMC and its Raman spectrum. Laser pulse heating experiments that simulate the micrometeorite impact component of SW have been carried out in samples of pure graphite, and carbonaceous chondrites Allende (CV3) and Murchison (CM2). Pulse heating was done in vacuum (1×10-6 torr) with a 20 Hz 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser, a 6 ns pulse duration (30 mJ/pulse), and a 200 μm spot size. Raman spectra were collected on the each sample using a WITec alpha300 R confocal Raman microscope, with a 1 mW 532 nm continuous laser and a ~10 μm laser spot size. UVVIS-NIR (0.4-2.5 µm) reflectance was measured using an Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. FieldSpec 4 spectrometer. Based on its Raman spectra, the original pure graphite is modified to nanocrystalline graphite by 10 minutes (12,000 laser pulses), and further modified to glassy carbon (amorphous 3-coordinate carbon) within 20 minutes (24,000 laser pulses). Vapor deposited on the side of the sample holder has a Raman spectrum consistent with amorphous carbon glass (3- and 4-coordinate carbon). Laser SW carried out on a slab of Murchison resulted in the production of glassy carbon inside siliceous melt blobs in the laser craters. Surprisingly, the Raman spectrum for MMC in Allende powder does not change, despite the production of melt glass and changes to its reflectance spectra. To confirm our Raman results, compositional and structural analyses of the carbon bearing SW products in Allende and Murchison will be done using transmission electron microscopy. Future work will expand our samples to other aqueously altered meteorites such as CI1 and CM1 chondrites",

            "abstract": "Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) are aeolian bedforms that are morphologically and dimensionally distinct from Large Dark Dune (LDD) fields, being generally brighter than, or of similar albedo to, the surrounding terrain. These features are significantly smaller than the LDDs, appear to form normal to local winds, and tend to have simple, transverse, ripple-like morphologies. Whether these small martian bedforms represent large granule ripples, small transverse dunes, or something else entirely is currently under debate. The spatial distribution of TARs provides important information about where on Mars aeolian sediments are concentrated, and determining their volume can help us constrain the sediment transport regime on Mars. Also, if we can determine if TARs were active only in the past, or whether TARs are mobile under today’s wind conditions, then we can begin to assess when and where TARs are/were active over Mars’ recent geological history. Thus TARs have the potential for being indicators/records of climate change on Mars.\nIn this work we build on previous work [1,2] and focus on the local/regional scale. We have identified six regional study areas, each 5° by 5°, to investigate the behavior of TARs in detail; one in the northern hemisphere, three in the equatorial band, and two in the southern hemisphere. We have systematically mapped TAR and LDD deposits in each study area to constrain sediment transport pathways and identify sediment sources. In general, TAR sediments appear to be tied to local sources such as LDDs or layered terrains. HiRISE DTMs were utilized to measure TAR heights, widths, wavelengths, and lengths to calculate sediment volumes and estimate volumes over entire study areas based on mapping. Crater count analyses on contiguous TAR fields in the equatorial regions, where the bedforms appear more lithified, reveal ages of several million years. Mid-latitude TAR fields do not show any superposed craters, suggesting much younger deposits.\n",

This kind of interannual variability is corresponding to the dominating 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation in precipitation and streamflow in California. When using global climate model projections to assess the climate change impact on water resources planning in California, it is natural to ask if global climate models are able to reproduce the observed interannual variability like 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation.\nFurther spectral analysis to tree ring retrieved precipitation and historical precipitation record proves the existence of 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation in California. But while implementing spectral analysis to all the CMIP5 and CMIP3 global climate model historical simulations using wavelet analysis approach, it was found that only two models in CMIP3 , CGCM 2.3.2a of MRI and NCAP PCM1.0, and only two models in CMIP5, MIROC5 and CESM1-WACCM, have statistically significant 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillations in California.\nMore interesting, the existence of 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation in the global climate model simulation is also sensitive to initial conditions. 12-13 yr quasi-decadal oscillation occurs in one ensemble run of CGCM 2.3.2a of MRI but does not exist in the other four ensemble runs.",

            "abstract": "Lakes strongly influence local and regional climate especially in regions where they are abundant. Development of a lake model for the purpose of integration within a regional climate model is therefore a subject of scientific interest. Of particular importance are the heat flux predictions provided by the lake model since they function as key forcings in a fully coupled atmosphere-land-lake system. The first step towards a coupled model is to validate and characterize the accuracy of the lake model over a range of conditions and to identify limitations. In this work, validation results from offline tests of the Canadian Small Lake Model; a deterministic, computationally efficient, 1D integral model, are presented. Heat fluxes (sensible and latent) and surface water temperatures simulated by the model are compared with in situ observations from two lakes; Landing Lake (NWT, Canada) and L239 (ELA, Canada) for the 2007-2009 period. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify key parameters important for heat flux predictions. The results demonstrate the ability of the 1-D lake model to reproduce both diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and surface temperatures for the open water period. These results, in context of regional climate modelling are also discussed.",

Rice (Oryza sativa), the staple crop for the largest number of people on earth, is grown under flooded soil conditions has higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than most crops. This is primarily due to high methane emissions. In this talk I will focus on recent work and reviews on efforts to reduce GHG emissions from rice systems while at the same time maintaining or increasing the productivity of these systems. Specifically, the role of water, straw and nutrient management will be discussed. A great deal of research has gone into evaluating alternate-wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation management. AWD has tremendous potential to reduce GHG emissions; however I will examine how it needs to be practiced to achieve these goals, as well as limitations to its use such as where it can be practiced and possible effects on soil C. Straw management is critical as it provides a key carbon source for methanogens. Straw, however, is difficult to manage and has limited alternative uses. Various forms of nutrient management have also been proposed to reduced GHG emissions in rice systems. I will provide an overview of these and discuss their potential.",

            "abstract": "Current climate models still have large uncertainties in estimating biogenic trace gases, which can significantly affect secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and ultimately aerosol radiative forcing. These uncertainties result from many factors, including coupling strategy between biogenic emissions and land-surface schemes and specification of vegetation types, both of which can affect the simulated near-surface fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, sensitivity experiments are conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine the sensitivity of simulated VOCs and ozone to land surface processes and vegetation distributions in California. The measurements collected during the California Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Experiment (CalNex) and the Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) conducted during May and June of 2010 provide a good opportunity to evaluate the simulations. First, the biogenic VOC emissions in the WRF-Chem simulations with the two land surface schemes, Noah and CLM4, are estimated by the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version one (MEGANv1), which has been publicly released and widely used with WRF-Chem. The impacts of land surface processes on estimating biogenic VOC emissions and simulating VOCs and ozone are investigated. Second, in this study, a newer version of MEGAN (MEGANv2.1) is coupled with CLM4 as part of WRF-Chem to examine the sensitivity of biogenic VOC emissions to the MEGAN schemes used and determine the importance of using a consistent vegetation map between a land surface scheme and the biogenic VOC emission scheme. Specifically, MEGANv2.1 is embedded into the CLM4 scheme and shares a consistent vegetation map for estimating biogenic VOC emissions. This is unlike MEGANv1 in WRF-Chem that uses a standalone vegetation map that differs from what is used in land surface schemes. Furthermore, we examine the impact of vegetation distribution on simulating VOCs and ozone by comparing coupled WRF-Chem-CLM-MEGANv2.1 simulations using multiple vegetation maps.",

Two fundamental differences between eruptions in seawater compared to those on land are that (1) eruptions occur at higher confining pressures, and (2) in a seawater medium, which has a higher heat capacity, density and viscosity than air.\nTogether with JAMSTEC collaborators we have a sample suite of submarine pumice deposits from modern volcanoes of known eruption depths. This sample suite spans a spectrum of eruption intensities, from 1) powerful explosive caldera-forming (Myojin Knoll caldera); to 2) weakly explosive cone building (pre-caldera Myojin Knoll pumice and Kurose-Nishi pumice); to 3) volatile-driven effusive dome spalling (Sumisu knoll A); to 4) passive dome effusion (Sumisu knoll B and C). This sample suite has exceptional potential, not simply because the samples have been taken from well-constrained, sources but because they have similar high silica contents, are unaltered and their phenocrysts contain melt inclusions.\nMicrotextural quantitative analysis has revealed that (i) clast vesicularities remain high (69-90 vol.%) regardless of confining pressure, mass eruption rate or eruption style , (ii) vesicle number densities scale with inferred eruption rate, and (iii) darcian and inertial permeabilities of submarine effusive and explosive pyroclasts overlap with explosively-erupted subaerial pyroclasts.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover's Chemcam instrument has identified manganese in relatively high abundance on several rock surfaces. The manganese abundances are several orders of magnitude greater than has been previously identified on Mars, indicating the presence of a manganese-rich phase. Although the specific phase has yet to be identified, these results suggest that the martian surface may have been much more highly oxidizing than has previously been recognized. The presence of a manganese-rich phase could provide an additional indicator of habitable aqueous environments. Given the importance of manganese for understanding past habitability, and the high abundances identified with Chemcam, we investigate the utility of using Mastcam multispectral imaging surveys to identify areas for subsequent detailed analysis with Chemcam. Vempati et al. showed that Mn3+ affect the reflectance spectra of Mn-bearing minerals. Specifically, relatively weak features due to electronic transitions and crystal field effects are observed in Mn-enriched hematites and geothites at 454, 554, 596 and 700 nm. The Mastcam-34 medium angle camera has filter band-passes at 550, 675 and 750nm, and we will explore the utility of using these bands (or combinations thereof) to determine if there is a contribution of Mn-bearing phases on spectra, specifically those that have been identified as having elevated Mn with Chemcam. The most common Mn-bearing mineral phase in terrestrial varnishes, Birnessite, has charge-transfer features that are similar to Fe-oxides but are centered at slightly longer wavelength band positions. Longer wavelength features are also common for other Mn-oxides, and this could be used to distinguish these phases from other Fe-oxide components. In this study we will present visible to near-infrared (0.4 – 3 µm) reflectance spectra on a suite of Mn-oxide laboratory standards. The set of standards includes Mn-oxide abundances that vary from less than 1 up to ~75 wt.%. Spectra will be downsampled to Mastcam bandpasses to determine if the effects of Mn-bearing phases could be identified from Mastcam multispectral observations in Gale Crater.",

Monazite from six samples contains up to 3 % common Pb, despite high U and Th concentrations. These high common-Pb monazites are characterized by high Sr, weak Eu anomalies, and low Y+HREE. The high common-Pb and Sr abundances and the weak Eu/Eu* are interpreted to reflect the absence of feldspar at (U)HP, and the low Y+HREE content is attributed to fractionation of those elements into garnet.\nSr and common Pb in monazite provide a tool for constraining the timing and duration of (U)HP metamorphism. More generally, Sr in monazite is a potential indicator of feldspar instability and may be applicable in other geologic settings, such as igneous systems in which the abundance of feldspar changes due to melting and crystallization. Sr is expected to be more reliable than Eu and Eu/Eu* as a tracer of feldspar stability, because Sr partitioning is less strongly influenced by oxidation state.",

Remarkable similarities between the structure and complexity of individual Martian channels with certain fluvial systems on Earth supports a popular picture of a warm wet early Mars. A key assumption in this picture is that \"typical\" Martian examples adequately capture the average character of the majority of all valley networks. However, a full catalog of the distribution of geomorphologic variability of valley networks over Mars’ surface geometry has never been established. Accordingly, we present the first planet-wide map in which we use statistical methods and theoretical arguments to classify Martian channels in terms of the mechanics governing their formation. Using new metrics for the size, shape and complexity of channel networks, which we ground truth against a large suite of terrestrial examples, we distinguish drainage patterns related to glacial, subglacial, fluvial and lava flows. Preliminary results separate lava flows from other flow features and show that these features can be divided into three different groups of increasing complexity. The characteristics of these groups suggest that they represent fluvial, subglacial and glacial features. We show also that the relative proportions of the different groups varies systematically, with higher density of river-like features located in low longitudes and increasing glacial-like features as we move east or west. Our results suggest that the early Martian climate and hydrologic cycle was richer and more diverse than originally thought.",

            "abstract": "Water isotope ratios (δ18O, δD) in precipitation, surface waters, and seawater comprise a majority of paleo-hydroclimate proxies in the tropical Indo-Pacific. The δD and δ18O of precipitation and water vapor are powerful tracers of atmospheric circulation processes, and can help to illuminate fundamental interactions between ENSO and the atmospheric water cycle. Throughout the tropics, past changes in δD and δ18O are often attributed to ENSO-driven changes in rainfall amount (via the tropical \"amount effect\") and related circulation processes. However, recent studies have revealed that ENSO’s impact on rainfall δD in many Indo-Pacific locations deviates substantially from the classic amount effect, with other fractionation and circulation processes becoming more important (e.g. Conroy et al., 2013). In order to accurately reconstruct past changes in Indo-Pacific hydroclimate using water isotopes, an improved understanding is required of the dynamical and microphysical processes controlling δ18Oprecip and δDprecip, and their relationships with ENSO and other climate phenomena.\nIn this study, we examine the controls on δDprecip and δDvapor in the Indo-Pacific and their relationships to ENSO in ground observations, data from the Troposheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA’s Aura satellite, and a new simulation with the isotope-equipped Community Atmosphere Model v. 5 (iCAM5). In both the model and in observations, we find that the dominant processes driving monthly to interannual δDvapor anomalies differ substantially across the Indo-Pacific. Prominent differences are evident between the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and the Central/Eastern Pacific (CEP), particularly in the relative importance of precipitation efficiency, detrainment, and rain evaporation on water isotope ratios. The dominant influence of the classic amount effect is spatially variable, with other processes playing important roles especially in the CEP. ENSO’s influence on δDprecip and δDvapor reflects the different controls on fractionation in each region. These findings may challenge the interpretation of some proxy records simply in terms of precipitation amount, while also opening up the possibility for novel reconstructions of other key aspects of atmospheric circulation using water isotopes.",

            "abstract": "Underlying topography controls lava flow emplacement by influencing flow paths, lengths, and advance rates. The morphology of the pre-eruptive surface provides input into lava flow models and the design of artificial diversion barriers, although the dynamics of interactions between topographic obstacles and lava flows are not well known. We investigate these factors by combining morphologic analysis of Hawaiian lava flows with scaling derived from analogue and molten basalt experiments. A comparison of pre- and post-eruptive topographic data shows that flows thicken on the upslope side of topographic barriers, a feature that has been employed to calculate flow velocities from simple energy conversion. Observations also document effects of flow branching and confinement on flow advance rate, with confined flows in Hawai‘i traveling further and faster than those that branch. To explain these observations we perform laboratory experiments using Newtonian and Bingham analogue fluids, as well as molten basalt. Conditions of flow splitting and subsequent advance are defined using experiments with both V-shaped and cylindrical obstacles that divide an unconfined flow. Oblique linear obstacles are used to explore flow confinement and diversion. We find that the degree of thickening, which determines the height of an obstacle capable of holding back the flow, is controlled by both initial flow velocity and obstacle geometry. Key is the ability of the flow to pass around the obstacle, such that larger and wider obstacles cause greater thickening than smaller and narrower obstacles. Flow advance rate is largely unaffected by branching in the Newtonian analogue experiments, but decreases after splitting in the molten basalt experiments because of surface cooling. Interestingly, flows into oblique obstacles are diverted but travel faster. Together these data provide the basis for a theoretical description of the interaction dynamics of viscous (and cooling) lava flows with topographic obstacles. These results allow quantification of the effects of flow branching and diversion on subsequent flow advance, which is essential for both predicting and mitigating the effects of future lava flows.",

            "abstract": "Flight operation results and plans of Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) to measure suprathermal particles (a ~few keV up to ~100s of keV) are summarized in this presentation.\nIons and electrons in this energy range play crucial roles in many fundamental processes of space plasmas including particle heating and acceleration, providing source material for the energetic particles accelerated near the Sun, the heliosphere, and in geospace. Characterizing these populations poses serious technical challenges because this energy region lies between the two most commonly used particle detection techniques, i.e., that used by thermal or plasma instruments and by Solid-State Detector (SSD)–based energetic particle telescopes, which are limited by typical SSD threshold energies of >10s keV. Our previous work has already demonstrated that a new type of low-noise, low-threshold Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) has an intrinsic noise level of 0.9 keV, and can therefore enable high-energy resolution measurements of suprathermal electrons and ions. In addition, APDs provide suitable solutions for space plasma detectors in low-cost missions/platform because of their light-weight, small-size, power-saving features.\nThis study presents two low-cost missions (a sounding rocket and a CubeSat) that implement APDs as particle detectors: (1) The Medium-energy Electron SPectrometer (MESP) sensor aboard a sounding rocket was launched from Poker Flat Research Range on 3 March 2014 as a part of Ground-to-Rocket Electrodynamics-Electrons Correlative Experiment (GREECE) mission. MESP successfully measured the precipitating electrons from 2 to 200 keV in 100-ms time resolution by using 2 APDs and 1 SSD. We show the overall results and the comparison with an MCP-based instrument results. (2) The Miniaturized Electron and pRoton Telescope (MERiT) on the Compact Radiation bElt Explorer (CeREs) to study charged particle dynamics in the Earth’s radiation belts. CeREs will be flown as part of a 3U CubeSat in a high-inclination low-Earth orbit in 2015. MERiT is designed to measure suprathermal to relativistic electrons from ~5 keV up to10 MeV, and 4 APDs will be applied to cover the lower portion of the energy range. Along with the calibration efforts, we will present predicted in-orbit performances of these APD detectors in the CeREs mission.",

            "abstract": "This study is focused in obtaining a geophysical-geological characterization of magnetic anomalies associated with outcropping or buried rock bodies and its possible relation to ore deposits. To do this, total field aeromagnetic data from the Mexican Geological Survey were processed. Reduction to pole and residual anomaly maps show two main elongated dipolar high-amplitude anomalies, a first NE-SW directed, which is located in the NW portion of the card, and a second corresponding to a belt with NW-SE direction that is located SW of the chart, near the eastern region of the \"El Elegante\" volcano. Above structures have not been mapped in the surface; however, the well-defined magnetic anomalies indicate its existence below Quaternary sediments.\nThe geology of the chart is only partially known. The outcropping units, mostly in the Sierra de Los Tanques, are Paleoproterozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks; Permian-Triassic granitoids; and Jurassic and Tertiary volcanic and volcanosedimentary rocks. About 50% of the card is covered by Quaternary sediments, there the interest of these geophysical studies.\nThe NW-SE oriented deep magnetic anomaly follows the same direction as the Sierra San Francisco (SSF) located south of Los Norteños chart H12A-2. This mountain is composed of Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks intruded by Upper Cretaceous granitoids. Numerous mineral manifestations of orogenic gold type occurred in that range. This anomaly can be interpreted in 2 ways: first: as a NW extension of a landform similar to the SSF, which dips to NW or that is more erosionated; or; second: as an extension of the SSF to the NW displaced by a normal fault oriented ~N60E, roughly following the Palo Fierro creek indicated on the map.\nEither of the two possible interpretations, the magnetic anomaly indicates an interesting target in the search of orogenic gold deposits that could be buried in the area.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the spatially-resolved composition of atmospheric particles is essential for differentiating between their surface versus bulk chemistry, understanding particle reactivity and the potential environmental impact. We demonstrate the application of nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (Cameca NanoSIMS 50 ion probe) for 3D chemical imaging of individual atmospheric particles without any sample pre-treatment, such as the sectioning of particles. Use of NanoSIMS depth profile analysis enables elemental mapping of particles with nanometer spatial resolution over a broad of range of particle sizes. We have used this technique to probe spatially resolved composition of ambient particles collected during a field campaign in Mexico City. Particles collected during this campaign have been extensively characterized in the past using other particle analysis techniques and hence offer a unique opportunity for exploring the utility of depth resolved chemical imaging in ambient particle research. Particles examined in this study include those collected during a pollution episode related to urban waste incineration as well as background particles from the same location prior to the episode. Particles from the pollution episode show substantial intra-particle compositional variability typical of particles resulting from multiple emission sources. In contrast, the background particles have relatively homogeneous compositions with enhanced presence of nitrogen, oxygen and chlorine at the particle surface. The observed surface enhancement of nitrogen and oxygen species is consistent with the presence of surface nitrates resulting from gas-particle heterogeneous interactions and is indicative of atmospheric ageing of the particles. The results presented here illustrate 3D characterization of ambient particles for insights into their chemical history.",

            "abstract": "Integrated Water Resources Management is an interdisciplinary approach to managing water. Integration often involves linking hydrologic processes with socio-economic development. When implemented through a simulation or optimization model, complexities arise. This complexity is due to the large data requirements, making it difficult to implement by the end users. Not only is computational efficiency at stake, but it becomes cumbersome to future model users. To overcome this issue the model may be simplified through emulation, at the expense of information loss. Herein lies a tradeoff: Complexity involved in an accurate, detailed model versus the transparency and saliency of a simplified model. This presentation examines the role of model emulation towards simplifying a water allocation model. The case study is located in Southern Alberta, Canada. Water here is allocated between agricultural, municipal, environmental and energy sectors. Currently, water allocation is modeled through a detailed optimization model, WRMM. Although WRMM can allocate water on a priority basis, it lacks the simplicity needed by the end user. The proposed System Dynamics-based model, SWAMP 2.0, emulates this optimization model, utilizing two scales of complexity. A regional scale spatially aggregates individual components, reducing the complexity of the original model. A local scale retains the original detail, and is contained within the regional scale. This two tiered emulation presents relevant spatial scales to water managers, who may not be interested in all the details of WRMM. By evaluating the accuracy of SWAMP 2.0 against the original allocation model, the tradeoff of accuracy for simplicity can be further realized.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 M=7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake occurred in the Salton Trough, a region of thinned lithosphere and high heat flow, and the postseismic deformation following this earthquake presents a unique opportunity to study the rheology of extensional environments and the mechanics of ductile flow within and beneath the lithosphere. Previous work [Rollins et al, in prep.] revealed that GPS timeseries of surface displacement following the earthquake were well fit to a coupled model simulating stress-driven afterslip on the deep extension of the coseismic rupture, Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in a low-viscosity zone in the lower crust of the Salton Trough aligned with areas of high heat flow, and Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in a three-dimensional asthenosphere with geometry matching that of the regional lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary inferred from receiver functions. Extending the success of this model to a robust interpretation of the mechanics of deformation at depth requires a better understanding of uncertainties and trade-offs between parameters (depth of the brittle-ductile transition, viscosities of the lower crust and asthenosphere, geometry of viscosity anomalies in the Salton Trough, frictional parameters of the possible downdip extensions of the coseismic rupture, and correlations among these parameters). We will show results from recent work that uses a newly developed method to efficiently explore this model space in a Bayesian sense. The method employs the Neighborhood Algorithm of Sambridge [1999], which makes use of Voronoi cells to optimize the search in the model space, samples regions that contains models of acceptable data fit, and extracts robust information from the ensemble of models obtained. The method is particularly well suited to identify a class of models that fit geodetic data approximately equally well, allowing us to present and discuss a range of possible deformation mechanisms. This method can be applied to any study of postseismic deformation and represents a significant step towards directly inferring best-fit rheological parameters from geodetic data in a way that considers many deformation mechanisms simultaneously.",

However, the ongoing warming makes it questionable if high latitude landscapes still function as net C sinks. In this study we used multiyear high resolution C flux data to estimate an integrated terrestrial-aquatic C balance of a sub-arctic catchment. The results indicate large inter annual variability in C fluxes and suggest that the C sink function of this landscape is weak, especially when also accounting for the often neglected C losses from aquatic systems. In fact, our results suggest that it is more likely that the studied catchment serves as a net source of C rather than a net sink. Our results highlight the importance of inland waters in the C cycle and that the strength of the C sequestering in the contemporary sub-arctic environment is much weaker than often assumed.",

            "abstract": "Field data and microscopic analysis are combined with numerical simulation to investigate the mechanism of wiggly compaction band formation in the high-porosity aeolian Aztec sandstone, Valley of Fire, Nevada. Field data show that the segments of wiggly compaction bands have similar orientations to preexisting shear-enhanced compaction bands, H1 and H2. The wiggly bands are inferred to propagate and periodically switch orientations between H1 and H2. The direction of greatest compression (σ3) is interpreted as perpendicular to the overall strike of wiggly compaction bands, and the band segments that are perpendicular to σ3 are pure compaction bands. Analysis of micropores shows that pure compaction bands have the greatest porosity, and may have a different failure mechanism.\nIn discrete element modelling, a particle is used to represent a pore structure surrounded by several grains. Similar to actual pore structure, the breakable particle is compacted when the resultant force acting on the particle exceeds the yielding cap determined by the failure force (Ff) and aspect ratio of the cap ellipse (k). The discrete element model, built up of many breakable particles, is compressed to simulate the formation of compaction bands. The direction of propagation of compacted zones is determined by the cap aspect ratio (k). When k=0.5, compacted zones tend to propagate perpendicular to σ3, which corresponds to pure compaction bands. When k=2, two 45-degree directions are the predominant directions of compacted zones. The local stress state around a band tip is changed when it propagates, and the segment switches to the other direction when it reaches a critical length. As a result the wiggly compaction band takes on a wiggly pattern.",

            "abstract": "Parameter estimation is one of the biggest challenges in hydrologic modeling, particularly over large spatial scales. Model uncertainty as a result of parameter values can be as large as that from other sources such as the choice of hydrologic model or the choice of model forcing data. Thus far, parameter estimation has been performed in an inconsistent manner across the model domain, e.g., using patchy calibration or spatially constant parameters. This can produce artifacts in the spatial variability of model outputs, e.g., discontinuity of simulated hydrologic fields, difficulty with spatially consistent parameter adjustments, and so on. We implement a framework that is suitable for use across multiple model physics options to map between geophysical attributes (i.e., soil, vegetation) and model parameters that describe the storage and transmission of water and energy. Specifically, we apply the transfer functions that transform geophysical attributes into model parameters and apply these transfer functions at the native resolution of the geophysical attribute data rather than at the resolution of the model application. The model parameters are then aggregated to the spatial scale of the model simulation with several scaling functions - arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean. Model parameter adjustments are made by calibrating the parameters of the transfer function rather than the model parameters themselves.We demonstrate this general parameter estimation approach using a continental scale VIC implementation at a 12km resolution. The VIC soil parameters were generated by a set of transfer functions developed with nation-wide STATSGO soil data. The VIC model with new soil parameters is forced with Maurer et al. 2002 climate dataset (1979-2008) and the simulation results are compared with the previous simulations with parameters used in past studies as well as observed streamflows at selected basins.",

            "abstract": "Experimental observations of terrestrial biogeochemistry are often made at the scale of leaves and the rhizosphere or at spatial scales finer than that of the entire ecosystem. Classic examples include measurements of leaf-level photosynthesis and of soil respiration using soil chambers. Field experiments are often designed to test hypotheses at these finer scales or to test larger scale hypotheses linked to those finer-scale processes. In turn, functional representations of processes within a model are themselves scale-dependent hypotheses. They may be hypotheses that are broadly supported by experimental results or they may be more tentative. In either case, there is a need to evaluate the finer-scale hypotheses within the context of the model’s integrated representation of larger-scale higher-level behavior. For example, model results can indicate how a hypothesized process at the scale of fine roots might be expressed at the scale of whole stand evapotranspiration. These results can then inform the design of experiments and observations best suited for capturing that multi-scale behavior and dependency. However, it is often extremely difficult to extract results of finer scale hypotheses (functions) from fully integrated large-scale ecosystem models. Accordingly, we have developed a framework for extracting individual process representations from the Community Land Model (CLM) into modular units for functional testing. These modules encapsulate fine-scale hypotheses about terrestrial biogeochemistry. Results can be generated quickly with these modules and compared directly with the experimental observations at the appropriate scale. Alternative hypotheses can be quickly implemented and evaluated. We illustrate this concept with results from CLM and the Partitioning in Trees and Soils loblolly pine field experiment. Our findings suggest deficits in the model’s hypothesized relationship between photosynthesis and temperature and suggest a focus in subsequent experiments on temperature response functions. We discuss the broader implications of using the functional unit testing in evaluating hypotheses and other ideas about terrestrial biogeochemical processes, including how our approach strengthens mutual feedbacks between model and field experiment.",

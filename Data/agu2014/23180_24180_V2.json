            "abstract": "A rapid transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society is not only possible, but could also bring many co-benefits for public health, economic wellbeing, social equity, and more. The science supporting an urgent need for such a transition has never been clearer. Yet, social science data are also clear: the public in the US (and many other similar developed economies) does not, on average, share this sense of urgency, nor have policymakers shown a willingness to put scientific evidence above the perceptions of their constituents. The gulf between scientific and public understanding of climate change has spurred research on climate change communication, learning, and decision-making, identifying barriers such as misconceptions and faulty mental models of the climate and energy systems; poor understanding of complex, dynamic systems generally; and affective and social barriers to learning and action. There is also a growing opportunity to address these barriers, through tools that rely on active learning, that are social, engaging (and even fun), and that are grounded in rigorous science. An increasing number of decision-support computer simulations are being developed, intended to make complex technical problems accessible to non-experts in an interactive format. At the same time, the use of scenario planning, role-playing games, and active learning approaches are gaining ground in policy and education spheres. Simulation-based role-playing games bring these approaches together and can provide powerful learning experiences: they offer the potential to compress time and reality; create experiences without requiring the 'real thing;' explore the consequences of our decisions that often unfold over decades; and open affective and social learning pathways. Here, we offer a perspective on the potential of these tools in climate change education, communication, and decision-support, and a brief demonstration of one tool we have developed, World Energy.",

In the course of designing and building the NASA Earthdata Search Client, a \"concept-car\" discovery client for the new Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and NASA Earthdata, we learned important lessons about usability from user studies and our actual use of science metadata. In this talk we challenge the community with the issues we ran into: the critical usability stumbling blocks for even seasoned researchers, \"bug reports\" from users that were ultimately usability problems in metadata, the challenges and questions that arise from incorporating \"visual metadata\", and the state of data access services.

            "abstract": "The isotopic compositions (d13C, d18O) of natural carbonates produced by the alteration of basic and ultrabasic rocks on the Oman ophiolite have been measured in order to better understand their formation mechanisms. Fossil carbonates developed on altered peridotitic samples, mostly found in fractures, and contemporary carbonates were studied. The samples bear a large range of d13C. Those collected in veins are magnesian (magnesite, dolomite) and have a carbon signature reflecting mixing of processes and important fractionation (-11‰ to 8‰). Their association with talc and lizardite suggests they are by-products of a serpentinization process, that must have occurred as a carbon-rich fluid was circulating at depth. On the other hand, the carbonates are mostly calcic when formed in alkaline springs, most of which are located in the vicinity of lithological discontinuities such as the peridotite-gabbro contact (Moho). Aragonite forms a few meters below the surface of the ponds in Mg-poor water, and is systematically associated with brucite (Mg(OH)2). This suggests most of the Mg dissolved at depth has reprecipitated during the fluid’s ascension through fractures or faults as carbonates and serpentine. Further up, on the surface waters of the ponds (depleted in Mg and D.I.C.), thin calcite films precipitate and reach extremely negative d13C values (-28‰), which could reflect either a biological carbon source, or kinetic fractionation from pumping atmospheric CO2. Their formation represent an efficient and natural process for carbon dioxide mineral sequestration. The d18O signature from all samples confirm the minerals crystallized from a low-temperature fluid. The hyperalkaline conditions (pH between 11 and 12) allowing for these fast precipitation kinetics are generated by the serpentinization process occurring at depth, as indicated by the measured associated H2-rich gas flows (over 50%) seeping out to the surface.",

            "abstract": "Cruise 14-02 of the RV/IB N.B. Palmer conducted the first multidisciplinary oceanographic investigation of the continental shelf within the Dalton Iceberg Tongue polynya off the Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica. At >350 m in the northeastern polynya, hydrographic measurements confirmed that relatively warm (>0°C) oceanic thermocline water from near the shelf break has been imported to the shelf but likely within an interior recirculation associated with local mid-shelf bathymetry. CHIRP sub-bottom data revealed ~15 m of acoustically transparent sediment in a 550-m deep basin proximal to this feature. A suite of coring devices was used to recover a complete 13-m sequence of Late Pleistocene glacial diamict and Holocene laminated diatom oozes and muds (NBP14-02 MC 45, KC 27B, JPC 27, and JKC 53) with chronology constrained by 210Pb and foraminifer-based AMS 14C dates.\nUnlike many Antarctic margin sedimentary sequences, biogenic carbonate (CaCO3) is exceptionally well preserved throughout the sedimentary sequence, likely due to non-corrosive bottom waters and/or low sedimentary organic carbon content. Planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma(s) is present throughout and abundant in the diatomaceous muds. Bulimina aculeata, which prefers calm, hemipelagic environments and bottom water temperatures >0°C, dominates the living benthic foraminifer assemblage.\nFossil assemblages oscillate between B. aculeata and Trifarina angulosa-dominated assemblages. As T. angulosa is associated with oxygenated bottom waters and strong bottom currents, this assemblage may record past changes in the location of the Polar and Slope Fronts. This interpretation is supported by T. angulosa presence in Thalassiothrix diatom oozes, which are associated with oceanic frontal zones and rapid biosiliceous sedimentation. Preliminary foraminifer oxygen and carbon isotopes, N. pachyderma(s) presence, and the observed T. angulosa Mg/Ca‑temperature (-1.8 to 0°C) relationship highlight the potential for detailed regional foraminifer-based paleoceanographic records, which will provide critical tests for developing proxies, including TEX86 paleothermometry. Future paleoceanographic studies will be supported by data from two long‑term oceanographic and sediment trap moorings deployed near the core site.",

            "abstract": "Dey & Dickman [2010] showed (using a theoretical model) that the oceanic response to atmospheric pressure forcing depends on the frequency and spatial pattern of the forcing. We have developed an observational Green’s function approach to determine the frequency- and spatially dependent sea-level response using satellite altimetric data. We applied it to 12 years of TOPEX sea-surface height (SSH) observations smoothed over a 4° × 8° grid at 3 day intervals and corrected for tides, winds, annual signals and secular trends. Wiener filtering, generalized for complex time series, was used to isolate pressure forced SSH within each gridbox. In most of the gridboxes, that SSH, after accounting for the forcing, showed a spatial and spectral dependence – a significant departure from the “inverted barometer” response.\nThe oceanic currents associated with the response were calculated from a spherical harmonic relation between current velocities and SSH [Dickman 1991]. The rotational effects (polar motion and change in Earth’s spin rate) of the pressure forced SSH & associated currents – with the pressure forcing accounted for, these are essentially Green’s functions – were calculated at specific periods and interpolated to other periods. The rotational effects calculated here are dominated by the pressure-forced SSH and show a strong frequency dependence & significant departures from an inverted barometer excitation. The pressure forced SSH is effective in exciting both prograde & retrograde polar motion at periods of ~ 6 days, and prograde polar motion at periods of 10 – 15 days. Compared to the theoretical approach, our work finds that the prograde component shows higher amplitude and less spatial variability, whereas the other components are ~ similar in amplitude & spatial variability.\nWhen these Green’s functions are combined with any time span of pressure data, they generate the total excitation for that time span. We will discuss the results for various spans of pressure data.",

            "abstract": "Vast amounts of physical samples have been collected in the Earth Sciences for studies that address a wide range of scientific questions. Only a fraction of these samples are well curated and preserved long-term in sample repositories and museums. Many samples and collections are stored in the offices and labs of investigators, or in basements and sheds of institutions and investigators’ homes. These ‘uncurated’ collections often contain samples that have been well studied, or are unique and irreplaceable. They may also include samples that could reveal new insights if re-analyzed using new techniques, or specimens that could have unanticipated relevance to research being conducted in fields other than the one for which they were collected. Currently, these samples cannot be accessed or discovered online by the broader science community. Investigators and departments often lack the resources to properly catalog and curate the samples and respond to requests for splits. Long-term preservation of and access to these samples is usually not provided for.\niSamplES, a recently-funded EarthCube Research Coordination Network (RCN), seeks to integrate scientific samples, including ‘uncurated’ samples, into digital data and information infrastructure in the Earth Sciences and to facilitate their curation, discovery, access, sharing, and analysis. The RCN seeks to develop and implement best practices that increase digital access to samples with the goal of establishing a comprehensive infrastructure not only for the digital, but also physical curation of samples. The RCN will engage a broad group of individuals from domain scientists to curators to publishers to computer scientists to define, articulate, and address the needs and challenges of digital sample management and recommend community-endorsed best practices and standards for registering, describing, identifying, and citing physical specimens, drawing upon other initiatives and existing or emerging software tools for digital sample and collection management. Community engagement will include surveys, in-person workshops and outreach events, the creation of the iSamplES knowledge hub (semantic wiki) and a registry of collections. iSamplES will specifically engage early career scientists to encourage that no samples go uncurated.",

            "abstract": "Dynamical changes in the tropical Pacific are hypothesized to have exerted an important influence on climate of the past millennium. However, direct proxy evidence in support of this hypothesis from the Eastern Tropical Pacific remains sparse. Here we present a unique 1000+ year continuous record of oceanic mixed layer temperature and its variability from a sediment multi-core collected in 2009 near the Galápagos Islands. The study location sits in the center of action of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major driver of tropical and global climate variability. We analyzed Mg/Ca ratios of multiple specimens of the mixed-layer dwelling foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber to reconstruct mean sea surface temperature (SST) over the past 1000 years. We also analyzed δ18O from individual specimens of G. ruber from the same samples to assess mixed layer temperature variability during the same period. Both the multi-shell Mg/Ca and single-shell δ18O reveal statistically significant and systematic changes during the past millennium. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, ~1100-1400 CE) features a sustained period of ~1°C cooler mean surface temperatures and reduced variability (by up to 35%) compared to the late 20th century. Little Ice Age (LIA) mean mixed layer temperatures were comparatively warmer and much more variable than the MCA. Intervals with greater variability than modern, as well as intervals with lower than modern variability are both present in the LIA. The most recent sediment interval corresponding to the period 1985-2009 CE has the highest mean SST of the past 1000 years, although it is within error of temperatures from ~1000 CE. An estimate of the zonal SST gradient of the tropical Pacific based on this Mg/Ca data and similar data from the western Pacific supports a pattern of enhanced zonal gradient during the MCA and reduced gradient during the LIA. We explore the implications of these results for tropical Pacific dynamics in the context of external forcing from volcanic and solar variability.",

            "abstract": "Terminal lakes are heavily impacted by regional changes in climate. Devils Lake (DL) is a terminal lake located in the northeastern North Dakota of the US. Since 1990, following a shift in regional precipitation pattern, DL has encountered a 10 m water level rise, with over 400% increase in surface area and 600% increase in water volume, costing over $1.5 billion in mitigation. Currently, the lake is <1.5 m from spillover level to the nearby Sheyenne River with potential negative consequences for downstream water quality and flooding. Recently, the artificial outlets have been constructed and operated to divert DL water to the Sheyenne River amid legal and political pressure. Outlet construction however did not take into consideration possible changes in local climate. We modeled the DL basin (~9,800 km2) hydrology using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and estimated future water levels of DL for different outlet scenarios under three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SRES scenarios (A1B, B1 & A2) for 2020s and 2050s. We evaluated model performance by comparing SWAT simulated daily streamflow outputs against the observed streamflow data recorded at 6 USGS water gauge locations within the basin. Future climate conditions in the region were estimated by combining historical weather data (1981-2010), 15 CMIP3 General Circulation Model projections from the IPCC data center, and stochastic downscaling methodology (LARS-WG). Our results indicate significant likelihood (7.3% ̶ 20.0%) of uncontrolled DL water overspill in the next few decades in the absence of outlets, with some members of GCM integration ensemble carrying over 85.0% and 95.0% overspill probability for 2020s and 2050s respectively. However, full-capacity outlets show radical reduction in overspill probability to partially mitigate the flooding problem by decreasing the average lake level by approximately 1.9 m and 1.5 m in 2020s and 2050s. Moreover, had there been outlet operation from the beginning of the flood episode since 1990s, not only the future overspill risks but also the current flooding extent would have been reduced significantly (Fig. 1).",

            "abstract": "Decades of extensive palaeomagnetic research have resulted in an abundance of late-Pleistocene and Holocene palaeomagnetic secular variation (PSV) datasets. The accuracy of these datasets is dependent not only upon the quality of the PSV data, but also on the geochronological methods used for age determination of the PSV data. We showcase our recently published work (Lougheed et al., 2014), whereby we demonstrate the potential of using existing datasets that have been published in the past 35 years, whereby we evaluate the datasets and update the geochronologies to reflect improved knowledge of dating techniques. Specifically, we have developed a Fennoscandia region PSV master curve for the 14-11 ka period, to extend the existing “Fennostack” Holocene PSV master curve (Snowball et al., 2007). The 14-11 ka period in Fennoscandia was dominated by the retreat of the Fennoscandian ice sheet, and it was necessary for us to use fragmented datasets from a handful of locations that were ice-free early during the deglacial period. We updated the geochronologies of the datasets to reflect the latest understanding regarding 14C dating and pollen chronozones. We selected the updated datasets with the most robust geochronology and high-quality PSV data to construct our deglacial PSV master curve. The datasets in the resulting deglacial master curve display similar PSV trends, suggesting a regional PSV signal in Fennoscandia.\nIt can be concluded that, when reconstructing temporal PSV trends for large regions, consideration of the quality of both the geochronological control and the PSV data is very important. This conclusion is especially relevant for modellers who gather published PSV datasets for inclusion in their data-driven geomagnetic field models. Finally, we briefly speculate that a cyclicity seen in inclination data for Fennoscandia for the past 14 ka may be related to cyclicities previously seen in some data-driven Holocene geomagnetic field models, possibly representing an inherent feature of the geodynamo.",

Organic acid measurements were made with a Chemical Ionization High Resolution Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (HRToF-CIMS) with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO) and acetate (CH3COO-) as the reagent ion. We investigate both individual species and bulk organic acids and partitioning to organic and water phases in the aerosol. Measured partitioning is compared to data from three other instruments that can also quantify gas-particle partitioning with high time resolution: another HRToF-CIMS using iodide (I-) as the reagent ion to ionize acids and other highly oxidized compounds, a Semivolatile Thermal Desorption Aerosol GC/MS (SV-TAG), and a Thermal Desorption Proton Transfer Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (TD-PTRMS The partitioning measurements for three of the instruments are generally consistent, with results in the same range for most species and following similar temporal trends and diurnal cycles. The TD-PTRMS measures on average ½ the partitioning to the particle phase of the acetate CIMS. Both the measurements and the model of partitioning to the organic phase respond quickly to temperature, and the model agrees with the measured partitioning within the error of the measurement for multiple compounds, although many compounds do not match the modeled partitioning, especially at lower m/z. This discrepancy may be due to thermal decomposition of larger molecules into smaller ones when heated.",

Over subtropical eastern ocean basins, particularly next to California, Peru, and Southwest Africa, low marine stratocumulus clouds (MSC) help to reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface by reflecting incident sunlight. The climate feedback associated with these clouds is thought to be positive. This project looks at CMIP5 models and compares them to observational data from CERES and ERA-Interim to try and find observational evidence and model agreement for low, marine stratocumulus cloud feedback. Although current evidence suggests that the low cloud feedback is positive (IPCC, 2014), an analysis of the simulated relationship between July lower tropospheric stability (LTS) and shortwave cloud forcing in MSC regions suggests that this feedback is not due to changes in LTS. \n\nIPCC, 2013: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

            "abstract": "The onset and distribution of melting and serpentinisation during rifting determine the continent-ocean transition width and composition and have been shown to depend on extension velocity. Conductive cooling during slow rifting favors serpentinisation and inhibits melting (Perez-Gussinye et al., 2006). Here we use numerical modeling to show that, additionally, lower crustal rheology, which also controls margin symmetry and width (Brune et al. 2014), strongly influences the onset and distribution of melting and serpentinisation. We find that strong lower crust rheologies effectively couple deformation in upper crust and mantle and lead to rapid crustal break-up through crust-cutting faults (see Brune et al., 2014), allowing serpentinisation to start relatively early and producing narrow, symmetric margins. Coupling of lithospheric layers leads to rapid asthenospheric uplift and the onset of melting at a relatively early stage during extension. For slow velocities, serpentinisation starts before melting, and the little magma produced probably ponds under the serpentinite layer exhumed after crustal break-up, generating a wide continent-ocean transition. For the same extension velocities, relatively weak lower crust shows a long initial phase of distributed faulting, with moderate lithospheric thinning, followed by a long phase of sequential, oceanward younging faults, producing wider, asymmetric margins. Serpentinisation is insignificant because lower crustal flow towards the tip of the active fault inhibits the formation of crust cutting faults. Asthenospheric upwelling is less pronounced, and the onset and amount of melting is delayed with respect to the stronger lower crust case. When crustal break-up occurs magma rises to form oceanic crust and hence a narrow continent-ocean transition. Along Brazil and Africa the margin’s symmetry, width and continent-ocean transition type change as the onshore terranes in which they developed go from cratons to mobile belts. We explore how this variability, through its influence in lower crust rheology, affects the 3D architecture of this margin.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture comprises about 80 percent of the total water consumption in the US. Under conditions of water shortage and fully committed water rights, market-based water allocations could be promising instruments for agricultural water redistribution from marginally profitable areas to more profitable ones.\nPrevious studies on water market have mainly focused on theoretical or statistical analysis. However, how water users’ heterogeneous physical attributes and decision rules about water use and water right trading will affect water market efficiency has been less addressed. In this study, we developed an agent-based model to evaluate the benefits of an agricultural water market in the Guadalupe River Basin during drought events. Agricultural agents with different attributes (i.e., soil type for crops, annual water diversion permit and precipitation) are defined to simulate the dynamic feedback between water availability, irrigation demand and water trading activity. Diversified crop irrigation rules and water bidding rules are tested in terms of crop yield, agricultural profit, and water-use efficiency.\nThe model was coupled with a real-time hydrologic model and run under different water scarcity scenarios. Preliminary results indicate that an agricultural water market is capable of increasing crop yield, agricultural profit, and water-use efficiency. This capability is more significant under moderate drought scenarios than in mild and severe drought scenarios. The water market mechanism also increases agricultural resilience to climate uncertainty by reducing crop yield variance in drought events. The challenges of implementing an agricultural water market under climate uncertainty are also discussed.",

The graduate fellows prepare lessons for the students incorporating different facets of their research. The lessons vary in degree of difficulty according to the content covered in the classroom and the grade level of the students. The focus of each lesson is directed toward the individual research of the STEM graduate student using inquiry based designed activities. Scientific instruments that are used in STEM research (e.g. SkyMaster weather stations, GPS, portable SEM, Inclinometer, Soil Moisture Probe, Google Earth, ArcGIS Explorer) are also utilized by K-12 students in the activities developed by the graduate students. Creativity and problem solving skills are sparked by curiosity which leads to the discovery of new information. The graduate students work to enhance their ability to effectively communicate their research to members of society through the creation of research linked classroom activities, enabling the 7-12th grade students to connect basic processes used in STEM research with the required state and national science standards. The graduate students become respected role models for the high school students because of their STEM knowledge base and their passion for their research. Sharing enthusiasm for their chosen STEM field, as well as the application techniques to discover new ideas, the graduate students stimulate the interests of the classroom students and model authentic science process skills while highlighting the relevance of STEM research to K-12 student lives. The measurement of the student attitudes about science is gathered from pre and post interest surveys for the past four years. This partnership allows students, teachers, graduate students, and the public to participate in interactive real-world science scenarios. Success of this partnership is measured by the enhancement of student interest in STEM sciences and learning skills for each child.",

            "abstract": "Each year during winter season (December-January), dense fog engulfs the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) in southern Asia, for more than a month, disrupting daily life of millions of people inhabiting the IGP. The widespread nature of the fog is frequently visible in satellite imagery, extending over a stretch of ~1500 km; that covers parts of Pakistan, northern India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Both, haze and fog are a tightly-coupled system over the IGP, during winter months, and have been a major environmental/climatic issue since the past several decades. Trends in poor visibility suggest a significant increase in worsening air quality and foggy days over the IGP. The persistent and widespread nature of the winter haze and fog is strongly influenced by the regional meteorology during wintertime, i.e. a stable boundary layer, low temperatures, high relative humidity and light winds. The valley-type topography of the IGP, adjacent to the towering Himalaya, and high concentrations of pollution aerosols, further favors the persistence of hazy/foggy conditions. A satellite-based observational portrayal will be presented, using various cloud, aerosol and radiation datasets, to characterize the widespread nature of winter haze and fog, based on a multi-sensor assessment from MODIS, CERES, AVHRR and CALIPSO datasets. More specifically, based on these observations, we will present results on: long-term trends/variability of winter haze and fog, vertical characterization of aerosol/fog/low-clouds, as well as assessment of the direct radiative effect of the region-wide haze/fog system. Results from this work are anticipated to shed light on the overall interactions within the highly persistent and tightly-coupled haze-fog phenomena. Additionally, against the backdrop of a changing climate scenario, possible linkages between the winter-time fog cover, regional meteorology and aerosol loading will also be discussed over the IGP.",

            "abstract": "Gross primary production (GPP) is a measure of photosynthesis, which can be estimated from the fraction of photosynthetically radiation (PAR) absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) and leaf area index (LAI). The MOD15A2 LAI/FPAR product is one of the standard products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. However, only the PAR absorbed by chlorophyll of the canopy, not the PAR absorbed by the foliage or by the entire canopy, is used for photosynthesis. Therefore, we use a canopy-leaf radiative transfer model PROSAIL2 with MAIAC retrieved surface reflectance to derive the fraction of PAR absorbed by the foliage (fAPARfoliage), the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll of the canopy (fAPARchl), LAI, and the photosynthetic section of LAI (LAIchl=LAI*fAPARchl/fAPARfoliage). We compare six years(2001-2006) of Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) simulations of GPP in selected AmeriFlux tower sites across croplands and forests. Three LAI data sets of each site have been implemented into CLM to simulate GPP: (1) default LAI with CLM, (2) MOD15A2 LAI, and (3) MODIS LAIchl from fAPARchl. Differences among measured GPP and simulated GPP derived from CLM default LAI, MOD15A2 LAI and LAIchl have been analyzed. The results show that during the growing season, spring estimates of MODIS LAIchl/fAPARchl GPP are much closer to tower data than CLM default GPP and MOD15A2 GPP, with R-squared values of 0.71, -0.06 and -0.09, respectively. Thus, while continued efforts are needed in more sites and vegetation types, the new MODIS LAIchl/fAPARchl product will likely be able to increase accuracy of GPP simulations and improve vegetation phenology dynamics response to climate variability.",

            "abstract": "While glacier responses to climate are understood in general terms and in their main trends, model based projections are affected by the type of model used and uncertainties in the meteorological input data, among others. Recent works have attempted at improving glacio-hydrological models by including neglected processes and investigating uncertainties in their outputs.\nIn this work, we select two knowledge gaps in current modelling practices and illustrate their importance through modelling with a fully distributed mass balance model that includes some of the state of the art approaches for calculations of glacier ablation, accumulation and glacier geometry changes.\nWe use an advanced mass balance model applied to glaciers in the Andes of Chile, Swiss Alps and Nepalese Himalaya to investigate two issues that seem of importance for a sound assessment of glacier changes: 1) the use of physically-based models of glacier ablation (energy balance) versus more empirical models (enhanced temperature index approaches); 2) the importance of the correct extrapolation of air temperature forcing on glaciers and the large uncertainty in model outputs associated with it. The ablation models are calibrated with a large amount of data from in-situ campaigns, and distributed observations of air temperature used to calculate lapse rates and calibrate a thermodynamic model of temperature distribution.\nWe show that no final assessment can be made of what type of melt model is more appropriate or accurate for simulation of glacier ablation at the glacier scale, not even for relatively well studied glaciers. Both models perform in a similar manner at low elevations, but important differences are evident at high elevations, where lack of data prevents a final statement on which model better represent the actual ablation amounts.\nAccurate characterization of air temperature is important for correct simulations of glacier mass balance and volume changes. Substantial differences are obtained if we use the common approach of constant in time LRs (even if properly calibrated) or more sophisticated approaches accounting for the different thermal regime off and on-glacier, as distinct thermal conditions exist on and off glacier associated with the presence of the glacier boundary layer where katabatic flow is important.",

            "abstract": "Death Valley, a half-graben within the Eastern California Shear Zone at the western edge of the Basin and Range structural province, is being simultaneously extended east-west by normal faults seen in outcrop at its eastern edge, and sheared by strike-slip along the North and South Death Valley fault zones. Controversy surrounds the extent, mechanism, and activity of fault slip on the low-angle detachment fault that dips west beneath the valley. While geological evidence points to possibly active detachment faulting, no evidence of seismicity associated with a seismically active detachment fault has been reported. The valley lies between two regional seismic networks, and the precision of locations of the relatively few earthquakes cataloged by the networks is insufficient to address these details. To characterize microseismicity that accompanies active deformation, we deployed 12 portable seismographs for over a year, testing the hypothesis that the detachment fault is microseismically active, albeit at a level too low to have been usefully detected by the regional networks. Of the couple of thousand events recorded on our array, 313 with magnitudes between 0 and 2.5 are located within the central portion of Death Valley. We relocated these earthquakes using a velocity model and individual station delays derived using the VELEST program. Initial results reveal a westward-dipping pattern of hypocenters consistent with the geometry of the westward-dipping detachment fault, however with considerable scatter. The earthquakes were highly clustered; if they occurred on the detachment fault, large parts of it were silent during the experiment. First-motion focal mechanisms indicate normal fault slip on a mixture of low-angle and high-angle planes as well as some strike-slip earthquakes. We will also present an analysis of high-precision relative relocations. The field experiment was brought to an early end due to monsoon flooding in July of 2013.",

            "abstract": "River networks are the main conduits that transport water, sediment, and nutrients from continental interiors to the oceans. They also shape topography as they erode through bedrock. These hierarchical networks are dynamic: there are numerous examples of apparent changes in the topology of river networks through geologic time. But these examples are geographically scattered, the evidence can be ambiguous, and the mechanisms that drive changes in river networks are poorly understood. This makes it difficult to assess how pervasive river network reorganization is, how it operates, and how the interlocking river basins that compose a given landscape are changing through time. Recent progress has improved the situation. We describe three developments that have dramatically advanced our understanding of dynamic river networks. First, new topographic, geophysical and geochronological measurement techniques are revealing the rate and extent of river network adjustment. Second, laboratory experiments and computational models are clarifying how river networks respond to tectonic and climatic perturbations at scales ranging from local to continental. Third, spatial analysis of genetic data is exposing links between landscape evolution, biological evolution, and the development of biodiversity. We highlight key problems that remain unsolved, and suggest ways to build on recent advances that will bring dynamic river networks into even sharper focus.",

            "abstract": "The National Research Council (2012) has expressed a need for participatory science experiences for students. Opportunities are needed for students which 1) allow them to understand how scientific knowledge develops and 2) can heighten their curiosity, capture their interest, and motivate their continued study of science. Studies (e.g., Aydeniz et al., 2011) have also recommend educators provide students with opportunities to do science through extracurricular work with scientists. In addition to being given the opportunity to fully participate in the scientific enterprise, students must also be explicitly guided in their attempts to develop a more appropriate understanding of the nature of the scientific enterprise (McDonald, 2010; Rudge & Howe, 2010; Yacoubian & BouJaoude, 2010). Exploration of the Moon and Asteroids by Secondary Students, or ExMASS, provides such an opportunity for students. The ExMASS program is an education effort managed by the LPI/NASA JSC-led Center for Lunar Science and Exploration (CLSE), one of nine teams comprising NASA’s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). Over the course of one academic year, teams of high school students conduct their own scientific investigations of either Earth’s Moon or asteroids, with guidance from a scientist mentor. The program includes two elements: 1) a guided inquiry introductory research activity that builds student knowledge of current lunar/asteroid science and lunar/asteroid data, and 2) an open inquiry research project in which the students apply their knowledge to a self-defined project. Evaluation data collected during the predecessor program to ExMASS revealed many successes, but also room for improvement. In response, an Advisory Group consisting of past teachers and mentors was formed to address the gaps revealed in the evaluation data. The ExMASS program will continue to collect similar evaluation data including assessment of changes in students’ lunar/asteroid content knowledge, student attitudes toward science and science careers, and views of the nature of science and scientific inquiry. Exit surveys for teachers, students, and mentors will also be used to gather general feedback about the program and its impact.",

            "abstract": "The production of organic nitrates has significant atmospheric importance due to the impact on regional air quality by influencing NOx lifetimes and ozone formation. Additionally, these low volatility compounds readily partition into the particle phase and are important contributors to secondary organic aerosol. Once in the aerosol phase, organic nitrates undergo further chemical reactions that govern their fate in the atmosphere and, consequently, their impact on air quality. Recent research indicates that the presence of water on aerosol particles has a major impact on the reactivity of organic nitrates and that condensed phase hydrolysis leads to the destruction of organic nitrate species, depending on structure. Despite this knowledge, the chemical mechanisms, products, product reactivity and volatility are still uncertain, negatively impacting our understanding of aerosol phase processing and the contribution to air quality. To further understand the atmospheric impact of aerosol phase hydrolysis, we analyzed both condensed phase hydrolysis reactions involving alpha-pinene-derived standards and alpha-pinene photochemical chamber reaction filter samples, using a suite of spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques. We were able to measure the pH-dependent hydrolysis rate constants for several types of organic nitrates and identify specific reaction products. The chemistry involved exhibits a strong dependence on pH, providing important mechanistic clues. The results of this study will significantly contribute to our knowledge of aerosol phase chemistry and the impact on regional air quality with respect to the fate of organic nitrate species.",

            "abstract": "Formed mainly by anvil outflow and the remaining part of deep convective clouds after rainfall or in situ in the upper troposphere by synoptic events, high clouds are constantly found in the tropical region. The global cirrus cover has been estimated to be about 20-25% and their occurrence can be more than 70% over the tropics. These clouds have lifetime that can go from hours to a few days, large coverage area and have been recognized as important agents of the climate system as they can signiﬁcantly alter the radiation balance of the atmosphere. Despite being relatively transparent to solar radiation (optical depth < 3.0), they trap the infrared radiation that would be lost to space, and thus may have a positive radiative forcing. In this paper, we report on tropical cirrus clouds characteristics as measured by a Lidar station operational in the central Amazon (2.89° S 59.97° W) since 2011. An automated algorithm for the detection of cirrus clouds was developed to determine the clouds geometrical properties. The transmittance of the lidar signal was used to derive the cirrus optical depth. The Klett method was used to derive the backscattering coeﬃcient and to estimate the lidar ratio of the cirrus clouds. Precipitation information by TRMM satellite and wind field by ERA Interim reanalysis from ECMWF were used. As the results from the ﬁrst two years of measurements (2011-2012), we found that the occurrence of high clouds with base altitude higher than 8 km (temperatures below -20°C) was approximately 71.0% of the total time of observation, varying between about 50% in the dry season (JJA) and about 80% in the wet season (DJF). These all cirrus clouds were classifies as subvisual (τ<0.03) approximately 24.2% of times, 40.7% were thin cirrus (0.03<τ<0.3) and 35.1% were cirrus stratus (τ>0.3). The average values of the cirrus base and top altitudes were 12.4±2.4km and 14.3±2.2km, respectively. They were found at temperatures down to −90°C they reside most frequently near the tropopause. The mean diurnal cycle of the frequency and altitude, during both summer and winter, indicate anvil outflow to be the most important generation mechanism. The mean lidar ratio was 20.0±6.8sr, indicating a mixed composition of thick plate and long column ice crystals. The behavior of these quantities with respect to temperature was analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust aerosol is the largest global source of ice nuclei, but the identity of the active sites for nucleation is unknown. During atmospheric transport, mineral dust aerosol can encounter and react with sulfuric acid, which affects the ice nucleation activity either due to changes to reactive surface sites or product formation. In this study, we reacted two types of clays found in mineral dust, kaolinite and montmorillonite, with sulfuric acid. Variation in the mineral due to acid treatment was separated from product formation through rinsing techniques. The samples were subsequently reacted with a probe molecule, (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)dimethylchlorosilane, that selectively binds to edge hydroxyl groups that are bonded to a silicon atom with three bridging oxygens. Hydroxyl groups are considered potential active sites, because they can hydrogen bond with water and facilitate ice nucleation. Attachment to these sites was quantified by 19F magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) of the 19F atoms on the probe molecule, which provided a direct correlation of the number of hydroxyl groups. Our results indicate that the number of edge-site hydroxyl groups increases with exposure to acid. Ice nucleation measurements indicate that the sulfuric acid-treated mineral is less ice active than the untreated mineral. Surprisingly, no difference between the nucleation activity of the untreated mineral and acid-treated, rinsed mineral is observed. As a result, we hypothesize that once a critical density of active sites is reached for ice nucleation, there is no further change in nucleation activity despite a continued increase in active sites. We additionally propose that the reduced activity of the acid-treated mineral is due to product formation that blocks active sites on the mineral, rather than changes to active sites.",

            "abstract": "Recent theoretical studies have shown that convective recycling of atmospheric water vapor gives rise to the isotope “amount effect” in which d values are lower than predicted by simple Rayleigh distillation processes (i.e. (DdD = dDvapor ­- dDRayleigh < 0‰). Several studies have linked isotopes in precipitation [e.g. Vimeux et al., 2009] and atmospheric water vapor [e.g. Samuels-Crow et al., 2014] in the tropical Andes to upwind convection associated with the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). The vertical structure of this convective influence, however, remains unknown. Understanding the vertical structure of the amount effect over South America is essential for improving theoretical constraints and developing better models of the influence of the SASM on southern hemisphere humidity. Additionally, evaluating the vertical and lateral extent of the SASM’s convective influence can provide important constraints for interpreting paleoclimate proxies in the region. We use data from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) to examine the vertical structure of the amount effect associated with the SASM and relate these results to regional convective precipitation and local subcloud equivalent potential temperature. Preliminary results show that DdD is below 0‰ from the boundary layer through the mid-troposphere over tropical South America during austral summer, and meridional averages show that convective precipitation is highest over these areas where DdD < 0‰ extends higher in the atmosphere. We hypothesize that the depth of convection in the monsoon region controls the vertical structure of DdD, which should also be coherently linked to local equivalent potential temperature.\n",

            "abstract": "The Indochina block is located at the junction of four plates, which are India, Eurasia, Philippine Sea and Pacific plates, and the geological evolution at this area is also complex. Due to the well-known Red River fault zone play an important role in the evolution of the escape of the Indochina block, the southern part of this fault zone also exist another boundary fault zone, which is called Ma river fault. This area still exists many unknowns in the tectonic evolution. Therefore, this study analyzes teleseismic receiver functions to determine the crustal structure along the Ma river fault, northern Vietnam. We have selected teleseismic events with Mw≥5, and epicenter distance is between 30° and 90° and a Multiple-Taper Correlation (MTC) method is adapted to calculate receiver functions (RFs) for each station. The converted phase, such as P-to-S obtained from RFs, allows us to have insights on the characteristics of crustal structures including the dip of discontinuous interface and anisotropy as well. The above properties have significant effects on amplitudes and arrival time of RFs. Thus, we use Neighborhood Algorithm applied to receiver functions computed from 5 stations has yielded optimum crustal models that include anisotropy and has minimum misfit between the observed RFs and synthetic ones. Our preliminary results indicate that the depth of the Moho discontinuity in the Ma river fault zone is between 25 km and 35 km, the range of S-wave velocity is from 3.6 km/s to 4.5 km/s, and the orientations of crustal anisotropy are related with the local stress status as well. In addition, the low-velocity zone in the lower crust is observed beneath our study area. We hypothesize that the low-velocity zone in the lower crust might be caused by rising of upper mantle, or an extension of the low-velocity zone in the lower crust which is observed beneath the southeastern Tibet and the South China block.",

            "abstract": "Interior evolution models of Ceres suggest that the dwarf planet likely differentiated due radiogenic heating in its early history. These models suggest that Ceres now consists of a rocky silicate core overlain by a H2O ice mantle between 50 and 125 kilometers in thickness (McCord and Sotin, 2005, JGR, 100, EO5009). At depth, this water layer may exist in the form of a subsurface liquid ocean. While upcoming gravity measurements made by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft will be extremely useful in determining the depth and state of Ceres’ ice mantle, large impact basins on Ceres provide an independent means by which to estimate the thickness of Ceres’ icy shell. The crater size frequency distribution observed on Vesta implies that approximately 8 bodies larger than 40 km diameter have struck Ceres over the past 4.5 billion years, with the largest expected impactor being ~70 km in diameter (Rivkin and Asphaug, 2013, Proc. LPSC XLV, 1649). Numerical simulations suggest that the transient craters formed by such large collisions are deep enough to probe below Ceres’ icy mantle and deform the silicate core. Because of material differences between H2O and silicate, the presence of the core suppresses the downward flow of material during the crater excavation process. This results in shallower, wider transient cavities, and should cause an increase in the crater size frequency distribution at large sizes. This widening effect may be enhanced by the presence of a strength-less liquid H2O ocean above Ceres’ core mantle boundary. While large basins in H2O ice will likely relax viscously over relatively short timescales, Ceres’ largest impactors produce more permanent depressions at the crust mantle boundary, which may be detected as negative Bouguer anomalies in the Dawn recovered gravity field.",

            "abstract": "Observations from natural vein systems suggest that preexisting veins can strongly influence orientation, continuity and connectivity of fractures in a rock even in cases where the orientation of the veins is incompatible with the orientation of the stress field.\nWe present a numerical method to model cycles of fracturing and sealing in a rotating stress field to simulate such systems, for different strength ratios of host rock and vein.\nWe study a layered model under vertical stress and uniaxial horizontal extension. This represents common conditions in sedimentary basins with layers of varying composition. The model with fractures that form during the first deformation phase is sealed and deformed again in a different direction to model the effect of a changing horizontal stress field. We find different types of fracture interaction with veins, depending on the strength contrast between veins and host rock and amount of rotation. The crack-seal and crack-jump mechanisms ensue naturally from the models as a result of the strength of the vein material relative to the host rock. Weak veins localize fracturing and reactivate, even in high misorientation to the extension direction. Connecting fractures between reactivated veins form at a higher angle to the veins than expected. In these systems, the connectivity of the fracture network is dramatically increased.\nVeins stronger than the host rock have less influence on the new fractures. Most fractures crosscut the veins by the step-over mechanism. Deflection occurs for favorable vein orientations but the deflection length is very short.\nThe results are in good agreement with natural crack seal vein networks found in carbonate rocks of the Oman Mountains.\nWe find that preexisting veins can change the fracture behavior of a rock in a way that new fractures do not necessarily align with the principle extension direction and form a highly connected network with reactivated veins that dramatically enhances lateral hydraulic conductivity of the rock.\nThe results allow formulating constitutive rules for the fracture behavior of rocks with veins that can be used to make predictions on the orientation and connectivity of fracture networks on a reservoir scale to use in THMC models.\nFurthermore they have implications for paleostress analysis based on crack seal vein networks.",

            "abstract": "Multicomponent diffusion in silicate melts is a very important process for mass transport in natural systems. It plays a large role in mixing and contamination of magmas, double-diffusive convection of magmas, and growth or dissolution of minerals in magma. The often-observed uphill diffusion profiles in natural systems and experiments require multicomponent diffusion treatment, but that has not been done. Instead, effective binary diffusion approximation has been widely used to treat chemical diffusion of components without uphill diffusion, even though it doesn’t offer a consistent model for diffusion in a multicomponent system. In this report, we follow a long series of efforts in studying multicomponent diffusion in various melt systems (including SiO2-Al2O3-CaO, SiO2-Al2O3-MgO, SiO2-Al2O3-MgO-CaO, SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O-H2O and a basaltic melt).\nChemical diffusion experiments in a haplobasaltic melt SiO2-TiO2-Al2O3-MgO-CaO-Na2O-K2O (50% SiO2, 1.5% TiO2, 15% Al2O3, 10% MgO, 19% CaO, 3% Na2O, 1.5% K2O) were conducted at 1500°C and 1 GPa. Nine successful experiments were carried out, of which 8 had initial compositions differing in only one independent component by 3 wt% (and compensated by SiO2). The concentration profiles in all 9 experiments were simultaneously fit using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to obtain the 6 × 6 diffusion matrix. All features in the 7 concentration profiles of 9 experiments are well reproduced by the obtained diffusion matrix. More experiments will be carried out to further understand multicomponent diffusion, and we will use the diffusion matrix to simulate diffusion in natural systems.",

            "abstract": "Cap carbonates are broadly thought to represent marine deposition during the glacioeustatic sea-level rise following a ‘Snowball Earth’ deglaciation (Hoffman et al., 1998). However, a few syn-deglacial Marinoan stratigraphic successions suggest that regional regression punctuated the deglacial transgression (Hoffman and Macdonald, 2010; Rose and Maloof, 2013). A number of questions about the sign and magnitude of post-Snowball sea-level change arise from stratigraphic studies of Neoproterozoic glaciations. For instance, can a local geological inference of the magnitude of transgression provide a robust estimate of the eustatic (globally averaged) sea-level rise associated with the deglaciation? If not, what is the range of geographic variability in regional sea-level change driven by deglaciation? Is this variability a strong function of the duration of the deglaciation? What circumstances could lead to a regional regression interrupting a glacioeustatic transgression?\nIn this talk, we explore the spatial and temporal variability of post-Marinoan Snowball sea-level change using a gravitationally self-consistent theory that accounts for the gravitational, deformational, and rotational perturbations to sea level on a viscoelastic Earth model. We apply the theory to model a Marinoan Snowball deglaciation across a generalized Ediacaran paleogeography with a synthetic ice sheet distribution. We demonstrate that the sea-level change following a synchronous and rapid (2 kyr) collapse of Snowball ice cover would exhibit significant geographic variability, producing local sea-level records characterized by syn-deglacial sea-level rise, fall and stillstand. Both asynchronous melting and longer-duration deglaciation scenarios (5 – 200 kyr) introduce additional complexity into the predicted timing and geometry of the computed post-glacial sea-level change; these complexities include zones of syn-deglacial regression followed by transgression and the possibility of major transgression (and, thus, deposition) that is not limited to the deglaciation phase. These results suggest that sea-level change recorded by strata capping Snowball glaciogenic units could record a far more complicated trajectory than simple transgression.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP1402) sailed to a virtually unexplored continental shelf along the Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica. The shelf contains the sedimentary record of environmental and ice volume changes within the Aurora Subglacial Basin (ASB), which is presently occupied by ~7 m sea level-rise equivalent of ice. We acquired 750 km of high-resolution seismic data proximal to the Reynolds Trough and Moscow University Ice Shelf glacial systems west of the Dalton Ice Tongue using dual 45/45 cu. in. G.I. guns and a 24 ch. streamer with 3.125 m groups providing a vertical resolution of ~3 m simultaneously with CHIRP data. These are the first images of this margin acquired and show a remarkable set of sequence stratigraphic transitions. Crystalline basement is at the seafloor landward and buried seaward with a transition to smoother reflection interface. Reflective sedimentary strata overlie the basement, dip seaward, and are capped by a landward-dipping regional angular unconformity. Above this are a series of transparent seismic facies that, along with the middle to outer shelf seafloor, dip landward towards a shelf-oblique glacial trough. The older, seaward-dipping strata include a deeper series of units that display at least three stratal architectures interpreted to be shelf deltas implying a pre-glacial, fluvial environment within the drainage basin. Above these sequences, the seismic facies transition to surfaces exhibiting significant erosion, small u-shaped valleys, and channel fill sequences, all of which are reminiscent of temperate glacial features. We interpret these sequences as including sub-ice tunnel valleys and grounding zone wedges with interspersed non-glacial to pro-glacial deposits. Increasing glaciogenic facies upsection suggests a gradual fluvial to glacial transition and increasing glacial extent with time. The subsequent transition to ice sheets is marked by erosion to basement landward and the angular unconformity seaward. The unconformity is overlain by glacial diamict, representing an incomplete record of cold-based glaciations after the ASB became ice-filled. Correlations with cores collected above and below the unconformity and deltaic unit should allow us to determine the ages of these transitions from fluvial to polythermal to ice sheets in East Antarctica.",

Specifically, we have analyzed dissolved 230Th concentrations at high-resolution within the water column at two locations (ML1208-12CTD; 8° 19.989’ N, 159° 18.000’ W, and ML1208-03CTD; 00° 13.166’ S, 155° 57.668’ W) sampled as part of a cruise to the Line Islands. The pattern of the dissolved 230Th concentration profile at 8°N is essentially linear from the surface to 2000 m and generally follows a reversible scavenging model. However, from 2000 m to 3000 m, the dissolved 230Th concentrations are constant, before linearly increasing again from 3000 m to the bottom. At this site dissolved 230Th concentrations range from 1.06 fg/kg at 100 m to 55.15 fg/kg at 4600 m. At the equator, dissolved 230Th concentrations are slightly lower, and range from undetectable at 25 m to 19.07 fg/kg at 3038 m. A nearly indistinguishable pattern in dissolved 230Th concentrations occurs in the profile at the equator compared to that from 8°N. The deep-water deviation from linearity between 2 and 3 km in the 230Th profiles (lower concentrations than expected) at both sites coincides well with the interval of the water column which has the highest concentrations of 3He. This 3He-rich signal has been traced to hydrothermal plumes from the EPR, thousands of km away (Lupton et al., 1998). We hypothesize that the lower concentrations of 230Th in deep waters of the central equatorial Pacific are a result of: 1) scavenging of water-column 230Th by Fe-Mn particulates contained within the EPR hydrothermal plume, and 2) lateral export of these 230Th-deficient deep waters approximately 7000 km westward. We will discuss the implications that the transport of this signature across vast distances has on water residence and transport times.\n",

The hydrodynamic component of the model has been previously validated against analytical and 3D numerical modeling results and has been shown to accurately reproduce flow field features critical to delta dynamics at the level of channel processes such as backwater profile, flow around a mouth bar, flow through a single bifurcation, and flow partitioning at the network scale.\nHere we focus on the morphodynamic component of DeltaRCM to: (1) identify a set of robust metrics to be used for validating morphodynamic models; (2) validate DeltaRCM results against a set of experimental and field data; and (3) investigate delta morphodynamics, especially the evolution of the channel network over time and the distribution of sand and mud in the stratigraphic record. The metrics analyzed span surface (e.g., channel density and wet fraction) and subsurface properties (e.g., sedimentograph and index of compensational stacking), as well as the system’s dynamic behavior (e.g., avulsion time scale and shoreline trajectory). These metrics are used to compare the model’s behavior to field and experimental data representing a range of boundary conditions, such as varying basin geometry, base-level cycles, and sediment input. The validation results show the range of applicability of our reduced complexity approach to modeling morphodynamics. DeltaRCM is then applied to investigate the deposition of sand and mud as a function of time and location for varying basin depth.",

The goal of this study is to quantify the multi-scale landscape organization, extract the range of scales at which self-similarity breaks down, and provide insight into how such an analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for understanding landscape evolution and external controls that might have shaped the landscape dissection. The Headwaters and Methow River Basins (located in North-West Minnesota and North-Central Washington, respectively) are selected as our case studies as they have completely different geologies, river network topology, and surface topography. A two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform with its powerful localization property is applied both as a multi-scale decomposition and reconstruction tool and its superiority over the Fourier decomposition is demonstrated. The wavelet spectrum of the Headwaters topography reveals the emergence of a spectral gap at certain range of scales, which is the first signature of dissimilarity for this landscape. The characteristic scales attached to the spectral gap were found to correspond to the distance between the quasi-periodic ridges and valleys forming regularity in the landscape topography, as forced by larger-scale geologic controls. Furthermore, by applying entropy-based metrics on the multi-scale reconstructed landscapes, we identify the scales at which the organization is “very tight” documenting once again the influence of external controls on such a preferential organization.",

            "abstract": "The Xigaze ophiolite is located at the central Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone, southern Tibet representing the remnants of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. It displays well preserved sections from mantle to crustal rocks, together with overlying marine sediments. The Xigaze peridotites have low CaO and Al2O3 contents and U-shaped REE patterns, suggesting that they are residues after moderate to high degrees of partial melting and were modified by infiltration of LREE-enriched boninitic melts. Two of five massifs from the Xigaze pillow lavas display tholeiitic affinity, while other three massifs show calcalkalic characteristics. The latter lavas show more HFSE-depleted and LILE-enriched compositions than those of the former. The latest diabase dikes possess high SiO2 and low TiO2 contents and show flat to LREE enrichment patterns, indicating they are analogue with boninitic rocks. Tholeiitic lavas were formed via decompression melting of a fertile lherzolitic source, whereas calcalkalic lavas and latest stage dikes were generated by melting of residual harzburgite and were influenced by slab-derived fluids. Both mantle and crustal rocks were invaded by plagiogranite dikes. The first plagiogranite group invaded into the crustal rocks lies on a continuation of the chemical trends defined by the mafic rocks and show similar REE patterns with the lavas, indicating they were generated by shallow fractional crystallisation. The second plagiogranite group invaded into the mantle displays different trends on Harker and REE patterns with diabase dike and enclave, but show uniform LREE depletion similar with mafic rocks, suggesting that they might be the product of subducted mafic slabs melting. LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf analyses from the second plagiogranites reveal that they were generated between 125-122 Ma, indistinguishable from those of mafic rocks. The zircons possess positive εHf(t) values ranging from +12.3 to +16.4, suggesting they were derived from depleted source. Taking into account the geological and geochronological characteristics of the Xigaze ophiolite, we propose they were formed in a forearc setting through rapid slab rollback during subduction initiation between 127-122 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Rapid urbanisation results in increased water consumption in cities, requiring improved tools for understanding adaptive measures for water resources management under climate change. The energy sector is facing the same challenges and requires equally comprehensive solutions. More frequent water shortages due to climate and land use changes and potential limits on CO2 emissions from fossil fuels that science demands indicate clearly that the next step in the sustainable city development will be to look for the most efficient use of these highly interdependent resources. One of the concepts that could be used for quantifying fundamental flows in an urban environment such as water and energy is the urban metabolism framework. This paper will examine the concept of urban metabolism by quantifying amounts and trends of water and energy consumed in London by four main sectors: residential, industrial, commercial and public. Key data requirements at the sector level will be identified and initial mapping of critical factors for urban sustainability will be provided. Finally, the work will examine the potential of urban metabolism framework to provide data and information for implementing water, energy and greenhouse emissions trade-off ‘fit-for-purpose’ strategy for water supply security.\nThe paper is a part of the Panta Rhei Research Initiative of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) under the working group of Energy and Food Impacts on Water.",

            "abstract": "The maximum level that water reaches during a storm depends on changes of mean sea level and storminess. Increase of mean sea level can be caused by mass addition, steric effects and land subsidence. Changes of storminess will change the height of ocean waves and storm surges. This study proposes a methodology for estimating the change of maximum water level at the coast as it results from the superposition of these different factors, and applies it to climate change scenario simulations in the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis is based on a 7-member ensemble of regional climate model simulations covering the period 1951-2050 under the A1B emission scenario. Models that include a high resolution Mediterranean Sea circulation component have been used for diagnosing the steric sea level change. Model sea level pressure and wind fields are used for forcing a hydro-dynamical shallow water model (HYPSE), wind fields are used for forcing a wave model (WAM), obtaining estimates of storm surges and ocean waves, respectively. The climate change signal is computed as the difference between water level maxima in the 1971-2000 and 2021-2050 period. Results show that in the next decades storm surge level and wave height will decrease and partially compensate for the increase of maximum water level produced by the positive steric effect.",

            "abstract": "Plant traits determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services, and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Plant traits thus are a key to understand and predict the adaptation of ecosystems to environmental changes. At the same time ground based measurements of plant trait data are dispersed over a wide range of databases, many of these not publicly available. To overcome this deficiency IGBP and DIVERSITAS have initiated the development of a joint database, called TRY, aiming at constructing a standard resource of ground based plant trait observations for the ecological community and for the development of global vegetation models.\nSo far the TRY initiative has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: about 250 trait databases have been contributed and the data repository currently contains about 5.6 million trait entries for 90,000 out of the world's 350,000 plant species. The database includes data for 1100 traits, characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence.\nBased on advanced methods for gap-filling and spatial extrapolation currently being developed in applied statistics and machine learning and in combination with environmental information and species distribution ranges, the unprecedented availability of ground based trait measurements is expected to allow for up-scaling of trait observations from plant to ecosystem level and from point measurements to regional and global scales. These up-scaled data products are expected to provide a link from ground based trait measurements to remote sensing of vegetation function and traits with global coverage.",

            "abstract": "Phenological transitions have large impacts on ecosystem processes, species interactions, and climate. However, phenology is a critical source of uncertainty in projections of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and the current generation of ecosystem models are highly variable and biased in their phenology predictions.\nMost phenological modeling has focused on diagnosing phenological variability and predicting long term responses to climate scenarios. Phenological predictions for the current season, on the other hand, are being made based on long-term means or expert opinion rather than real data.\nTo our knowledge previous research has not applied operational data assimilation approaches to produce operational, real-time forecasts of phenology. We present a phenology forecast data product that is automatically updated every day using current observations and weather forecasts. Specifically we fuse MODIS NDVI and PhenoCam based GCC with a threshold logistic process model at five sites across eastern forests, from North Carolina to New Hampshire. Prior to application, models were calibrated (2000-2012) using a Bayesian state space model. Forecasts for fall 2013, spring 2014, and fall 2014 were then generated on a daily basis using a particle filter.\nThe system successfully tracked seasonal phenology but forecasts showed high uncertainty and sensitivity to alternative model structures. Furthermore, we found that current phenological models in the literature are not formulated in a way that allows for dynamic forecasts. Work remains to be done to extend this work to a fully spatial context. In particular there is a need to determine the spatial range of influence of the tower PhenoCam data and to account for both land cover and random effects. More broadly, this work demonstrates the possibilities for the development of real-time ecological forecasting in other areas.",

            "abstract": "Fine grained channel margin (FGCM) deposits of the South River, Virginia sequester a substantial volume of fine-grained sediment behind large woody debris (LWD). FGCM deposits were created in a laboratory setting meant to simulate the South River environment using a recirculating flume (15m long by 0.6m wide) with a fixed gravel bed and adjustable slope (set to 0.0067) to determine how fine sediment is transported and deposited behind LWD. Two model LWD structures were placed 3.7 m apart on opposite sides of the flume. A wire mesh screen with attached wooden dowels simulated LWD with an upstream facing rootwad. Six experiments with three different discharge rates, each with low and high sediment concentrations, were run. Suspended sediment was very fine grained (median grain size of 3 phi) and well sorted (0.45 phi) sand. Upstream of the wood, water depths averaged about 0.08m, velocities averaged about 0.3 m/s, and Froude numbers averaged around 0.3. Downstream of the first LWD structure, velocities were reduced tenfold. Small amounts of sediment passed through the rootwad and fell out of suspension in the area of reduced flow behind LWD, but most of the sediment was carried around the LWD by the main flow and then behind the LWD by a recirculating eddy current. Upstream migrating dunes formed behind LWD due to recirculating flow, similar to reattachment bars documented in bedrock canyon rivers partially obstructed by debouching debris fans. These upstream migrating dunes began at the reattachment point and merged with deposits formed from sediment transported through the rootwad. Downstream migrating dunes formed along the channel margin behind the LWD, downstream of the reattachment point. FGCM deposits were about 3 m long, with average widths of about 0.8 m. Greater sediment concentration created thicker FGCM deposits, and higher flows eroded the sides of the deposits, reducing their widths.",

            "abstract": "Mixing processes control spatial and temporal patterns of water quality in large rivers. Studies of mixing at river confluences have mainly been limited either to laboratory junctions or to field investigations at small confluences. Detailed studies of mixing downstream from confluences in large rivers are difficult due to the expense and effort required to conduct such studies. The objectives of this research are: 1) to develop an empirically based model, based on spectral reflectance information, for predicting total suspended solids concentrations (SSCs) at and downstream of confluences, and 2) to use the predicted values of SSCs to better understand the dynamics of mixing downstream from confluences. The study site for our research is the Mississippi River at and downstream of its confluence with the Missouri River. Data consist of SSCs measured by the USGS in the Mississippi River between 1988 and 2003 and atmospherically corrected imagery obtained by Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellites during the same period. Data on spectral reflectance for pixels with measured sediment concentrations are used in a RandomForest regression tree analysis to develop a predictive model relating spectral reflectance to SSCs. This model is used to estimate SSCs downstream of the confluence for different dates of imagery. Cross-channel patterns of SSCs illustrate the degree of transverse mixing at various distances downstream from the confluence and are useful for ascertaining how changes in channel characteristics influence rates of transverse mixing. Preliminary results indicate that the magnitude of differences in SSCs between the two rivers, the momentum flux ratio between the rivers, and changes in channel width are important factors controlling rates of transverse mixing. These results advance our understanding of mixing in large rivers and help inform water quality management practices for such rivers.",

Here we present a new high-resolution multi-parameter seismic model derived from adjoint tomography, utilizing the full wavefield recorded by an unprecedented seismographic network in its surroundings. The new seismological constraints include Vs perturbation, the Vp/Vs ratio and radial anisotropy, (Vsh-Vsv)/Vs. We observe clear correlation between the high topography of the dome and regions with a low Vs and high Vp/Vs ratio down to 150 km. We also observe negative radial anisotropy (faster Vsv) at deeper asthenospheric depths (250 - 500 km) underlying positive radial anisotropy (faster Vsh) at shallow depths (< 250 km) right below the dome, and negative radial anisotropy at shallower depths (50 - 150km) on the flanks of the dome. These observations are consistent with a scenario that a deep asthenospheric upwelling arises from the mantle transition zone, producing decompression melting that feeds magmatism causing high topography of the area.",

            "abstract": "Many projections of sea-level rise (SLR) by 2100 require rise rates of >7 mm/yr after about 2050. Thus, in the latter half of this century, the global average SLR rate may be higher than it has been since about 7000 years ago. That includes a prolonged period of relatively slow sea-level rise over the past 2000-4000 years, during which many coastal landforms and their associated ecosystems (e.g., barrier islands, estuaries, wetlands) matured and extended across the landscape, building rich sedimentary archives. The understanding of coastal evolution in these settings is typically based on both recent geologic history and modern process observations. The recent geologic history can be sampled from relatively accessible sedimentary records, as opposed to earlier records deposited more than ~5000 years ago, which are scarce on the transgressed continental margin. In addition, few to no modern analogs exist for many coastal settings that will experience high SLR rates and where there is significant human infrastructure and development. These settings provide valuable resources and ecosystem services on which society depends (e.g., sandy recreational beaches and fisheries), where useful projections are most needed. Thus, traditional sources of insight – the stratigraphic record and modern analogs – are lacking and limit our ability, and confidence, to predict the form, magnitude, and spatial extent of future changes to the coastal landscape. If sea-level is indeed heading towards ~1 m SLR by 2100, we have a limited timeframe to understand coastal change at higher SLR rates, communicate information to decision makers, and allow sufficient time for action. This is a moderate probability, but extraordinarily high risk, high impact scenario. It is a region of the coastal evolution parameter space that warrants focused exploration to identify critical knowledge gaps, conduct research to fill these gaps, and build our understanding. We also need to apply current knowledge to this problem; we know how to make skillful, yet imperfect models. Are we ready to set them against reality and evaluate their utility for a rapidly-changing world? We present some examples of current landscape-change predictive capability and discuss their application with and without updated understanding of higher-end SLR scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The color and albedo of the surface of a large ice sheet is critical to its response to a changing climate. Decreasing the ice surface albedo enhances surface melt and has been suggested as a mechanism to trigger rapid collapse. Each summer, dark bands of ice 20-40 km wide are exposed along the margin of the Greenland ice sheet. These dark bands are clearly visible in satellite imagery and best developed along the west coast.\nWe use airborne radar data in both northeast and western Greenland to demonstrate that the dark bands are the result of outcropping stratigraphy. Where these dark bands are exposed at the ice surface correlate with locations where the well defined stratigraphy imaged with airborne radar is truncated at the surface. Surface work in the northeast by Boogild and coworkers (2010) has constrained the age of the three major intervals of exposed strata. Pink or brown Pleistocene ice lies closest to the ice margin, and is overlain by white pre-Boreal ice. The impurity-rich dark strata, are dated as early Holocene. The dark strata are likely a result of either periods of elevated dust during the Holocene or excess melt during the Holocene Climatic Optimum.\nWe use satellite data to map the extent of the exposed dark ice in Greenland using imagery from Landsat 8, Landsat 7, ASTER VNIR, EO1 Ali, and Quickbird with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.65m to 30m. Image acquisition focused on the months of July and August when the stratigraphy is best exposed. Little dark ice is presently exposed in the southeastern margin of the Greenland ice sheet as this region experiences higher surface accumulation. By examining satellite images from multiple years we have identified areas where the patterns of the dark ice are changing. Both movement of the strata towards the margin due to ice flow and inland retreat due to increased erosion are documented.\nAn outstanding question is what will be color of the strata exposed as the bare ice region expands in Greenland. The next step in this work will be to determine the thickness of the dark ice and what fraction of it is presently exposed. Dating the dark ice could be completed with linking the stratigraphy to the major ice cores.",

            "abstract": "The Iridium satellite communications service was launched over 15 years ago, and it is presently the “go to” service for transmitting data and voice from the polar regions. However there is very little information available regarding the metrics associated with the throughput of data via this system. During a recent campaign we released over 30 “dial-up” iridium enabled drifting buoys in a relatively small region of the Arctic Ocean. Over the past 6 months relatively large amounts of data have now been routinely downloaded (every hour) from these systems. Each platform, as well as the base station in the UK, independently monitored the throughput of data and here we present an analysis of the metrics (download speed, drop outs, power consumption etc.) associated with the transmission of data through the Iridium system. As the role of autonomous platforms in the polar region increases there is a greater need to better understand the issues associated with data transfer. Iridium is a vital component of any autonomous system and therefore the information presented here will be of value to the technological, scientific and engineering communities.",

            "abstract": "The April 1, 2014 Pisagua earthquake (Mw 8.1) can be considered as the paroxysm of a long sequence of unusually high seismic activity within the Northern Chile megathrust system. The sequence started in March 2014, with two weeks of intense foreshock activity, suggesting that the mainshock may have been trigerred by a slow slip event (Ruiz et al., 2014). The April 1, 2014 mainshock broke a portion of the subduction interface that had been previously identified as highly coupled, and seems to have been limited along strike by two zones of lower coupling. A significant earthquake occurred some 100 km to the south of, and approx. 24 hour after the mainshock (April 3, 2014 Iquique Mw 7.6 earthquake). This sequence illustrates the importance of short-term, short-range earthquake interaction mechanisms in controlling the slip behaviour of a megathrust interface, with important implications on associated hazards.\nStatic surface displacements during each phase of the sequence are determined using a combination of continuous GPS, InSAR (TerraSAR-X ScanSAR) and tide gauge records. Using a single elastic inversion procedure, we invert for the slip distribution associated with the sub-events, as well as interseismic coupling using continuous GPS, campaign GPS and InSAR measurements acquired in the years preceding the sequence. This methodology allows for consistently determining the spatial relationship between the different slip patches (pre-seismic, co-seismic, post-seismic and inter-seismic).\nThe bulk of the moment during the April 1, 2014 earthquake (Mw 8.1) was released 50 km to the south of the hypocenter, 50 km offshore from Pisagua town. In contrast, the April 3, 2014 earthquake (Mw 7.6) occurred beneath the coastal city of Iquique. Coseismic slip during the two main events depicts a complex pattern, broadly complementary with interseismic coupling, preshock / aftershock distribution and post-seismic afterslip. A detailed comparison of the successive sub-events aims at providing a first-order interpretation of the heterogeneity of frictional properties of the megathrust segment, alongside with the initial stress conditions that prevailed before the main rupture. The existence of major structural / geometric complexities within the megathrust system may also be inferred.",

A common failing of numerical weather models is the prediction of shallow cumulus clouds which are generally difficult to be resolved due to complicated processes in the planetary boundary layer. The present study carried out the sensitivity test of turbulence parameterization for better predicting solar irradiance during the shallow cumulus events near the state of Arizona by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The results from the simulations show that increasing the exchange coefficient leads to enhanced vertical mixing and a deeper mixed layer. At the top of mixed layer, an adiabatically ascending air parcel achieved the water vapour saturation and finally shallow cumulus is generated.

            "abstract": "Over the past few decades there has been enormous investment in atmospheric aerosol measurements across the globe. However, ultimately only a small fraction of these measurements are used to test and improve models. GASSP aims to bring together as much aerosol measurement data as possible in combination with a novel application of statistical methods to test and improve atmospheric model processes and improve our understanding of global aerosol and climate.\nPresently, we have synthesised a vast array of diverse aerosol measurements from aircraft, ground stations and ships, combining campaign and long-term measurements conducted over the past two decades. These data include in-situ measurements of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol particle number concentrations, sizes and chemical composition. By combining different aerosol measurements we can ensure that the model skill is consistent across a range of aerosol properties in a range of environments. We will present spatial maps and time series of these data, identifying key regions where gaps currently exist in the dataset and where future contribution from the measurement community will be most crucial.\nWe have also performed a sensitivity analysis of the output from a global aerosol model, which has identified the important sources of parameter uncertainty in all model grid cells throughout a single year. Cluster analysis of this data shows which model uncertainties can be constrained by observations in any particular global region during the year. Similarities and distinctions between clusters allows us to identify how observations made around the globe have the potential to constrain the global aerosol model and identify which model uncertainties will remain irreducible with the current suite of observations. As a first step we have used synthetic observations to constrain the model uncertainties and quantify the potential of real observations for model constraint. We then use these results to target real observations from the GASSP database that will provide the greatest constraint on model uncertainty.\nGASSP is foreseen as an ongoing effort to continually improve global models by synthesising the latest observations and we welcome continued contributions from the aerosol measurement community to our ever growing database.",

            "abstract": "Helium isotopes (3He/4He) have been extensively used to define distinct segments of Earth’s mantle and characterize its chemical structure. Specifically, they have been used to illustrate the long-term isolation and preservation of high-3He/4He (≥50 RA; [1]) plume-derived materials from the well-mixed and more-extensively degassed depleted MORB mantle (DMM) (8 RA; [2]). However, the He-isotope signature of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) remains relatively poorly characterized (6.1 RA; [3]). The Siberian craton hosts >1000 kimberlite intrusions, which carry mantle-derived xenoliths – of varying compositions (i.e., peridotites, dunites, and eclogites) – to the Earth’s surface, making it an ideal setting for investigating the chemical evolution of the SCLM. Here, we report new He-isotope and concentration data for a suite of eclogitic xenoliths (n=10) from the Udachnaya pipe, Siberia.\nHe-isotopes and [He] contents were determined by crushing garnet and pyroxene mineral separates from 2.7-3.1 Ga Siberian eclogites. 3He/4He values ranged from 0.11 to 1.0 RA, displaying predominantly radiogenic (i.e., low 3He/4He) He-isotope values. In contrast, Siberian flood basalt values extend up to ~13 RA [4]. Helium concentrations span ~4 orders of magnitude from 60 to 569,000 [4He]C ncm3STP/g. The radiogenic nature of Udachnaya eclogites indicate that they have been largely isolated from basaltic metasomatic fluxes over geological time due to position within the lithosphere and/or lithospheric age. Further, low 3He/4He values may reflect the addition of high U-Th material into the lithosphere by accretion of ancient island-arc terrains. These new data add to the growing He-isotope database [5,6] for the Siberian SCLM, and reveal the heterogeneous nature of this region with respect to He-isotopes, as well as the potential importance of crustal recycling and metasomatic processes.\n[1] Stuart et al., 2003.

            "abstract": "Once seen as exotic, global subsurface oceans are now considered to be a likely feature of many large icy satellites, with Europa and Titan as prime candidates. Under tidal forcing, the icy crust deforms as a viscoelastic membrane decoupled from the deep interior by the ocean layer. Regarding tidal effects, these satellites thus deserve more to be called `membrane worlds' rather than `ocean worlds'. I describe here the viscoelastic membrane approach, a new powerful tool to compute all tidal effects in a laterally uniform crust with depth-dependent rheology. This approach leads to simple analytical formulas for viscoelastic tidal Love numbers, with an accuracy better than one percent for h2 and k2, and a few percents for l2. This accuracy is sufficient for most applications. Membrane formulas clearly show how Love numbers depend on the interior structure (primarily the crust rigidity, crust thickness, ocean density and mean density). This method also yields simple analytical formulas for viscoelastic tidal stresses and tidal dissipation in the crust. All in all, the viscoelastic membrane approach is a good alternative to software encoding the full theory of viscoelastic-gravitational deformations.",

            "abstract": "Segregation of the metallic core from a silicate mantle is a crucial aspect of early planetary evolution. Although a magma ocean scenario is often used to explain differentiation of large planets such as Earth, smaller planets and planetesimals likely never achieved the high temperatures necessary for wide scale melting. In these smaller bodies, silicates may have only partially melted, or not melted at all. Furthermore, isotopic signatures in meteorites suggest that some planetesimals differentiated within just a few million years. Achieving core segregation on this time scale whereby core material drains through a solid silicate mantle via an interconnected network of melt faces two major problems: (1) in a hydrostatic situation, the percolation threshold is above 5 vol% melt, so the process would lead to inefficient core formation, and (2) the permeability of fully connected melts at microstructural equilibrium is low enough that some planetesimals may still not be able to differentiate on this short time scale. It has been suggested that shear deformation can cause isolated melt pockets to become connected even at low melt fractions. Here, we have measured the change in permeability of core forming melts in solid silicate and partially molten silicate matrix due to deformation. Mixtures of olivine or KLB-1 peridotite and FeS close to the equilibrium percolation threshold (~5 vol% FeS) were pre-synthesized to achieve an equilibrium microstructure, and then loaded into the high pressure X-ray tomography apparatus at GSECARS, sector 13-BMD, at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). The samples were then pressed to ~2GPa, and heated to ~1100°C. Alternating cycles of rotation to collect X-ray tomography images, and twisting to deform the sample were conducted. Starting materials and run products have also been analysed at high resolution in three dimensions using FIB/SEM cross-beam tools. Quantitative analyses have been performed on the resulting 3-dimensional x-ray tomographic images to evaluate the effect of shear deformation on permeability of core forming melts, and place constraints on the timing of core formation in smaller terrestrial planets and planetesimals.",

            "abstract": "Faults are weak features within reservoir-caprock systems and may affect the sealing integrity of suitable CO2-storage reservoirs. Changes in stress state due to CO2-injection may induce fault slip movement and potentially result in the formation of leakage pathways to fluids stored in the reservoir. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of changes in stress state on the slip tendency and transport properties of fault zones. However, flow properties of a fault zone are not only controlled by the fault core, but also by the surrounding damage zone. Therefore, it is important to understand the behaviour of both the fault core, consisting of fine-grained fault gouge, and the damaged but intact surrounding caprock.\nFault slip behaviour depends on both the stress state and the mineralogical composition of the fault plane. We investigated the effect of stress state on fault friction behaviour, fault reactivation, slip stability and flow properties. Three types of a natural clay-rich caprock (Opalinus Claystone (OPA), Mont Terri, Switzerland) were used: i) natural clay-rich simulated (crushed) fault gouge, ii) intact claystone samples and iii) intact clay-rich fault core material from the main fault in the OPA. The OPA consists of phyllosilicates (60%), quartz (~20 %) and calcite (~15-25%).\nWe performed triaxial, direct shear experiments at room temperature (σneff = 5-50 MPa, Pp = 2 MPa, V = 0.054 -10.9 µm/s). For the simulated fault gouge samples, across and along fault (argon) permeametry were measured both prior and during deformation to investigate the effect of shear displacement on transport properties. For the intact samples, only across fault permeability measurements were made.\nPreliminary results show that permeability decreases with shear displacement. The initial permeability of intact OPA is in the order of 10-20 m2. The permeability of simulated fault gouges, both along and across fault, is sensitive to the applied normal stress, with permeability decreasing gradually with normal stress from ~10-17 to 10-19 m2 for across fault permeability and from 10-16 to 10-18 m2 for along fault permeability. Across permeability is generally 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than permeability measured along the fault plane. This suggests that flow along the fault will be easier than across fault.",

            "abstract": "While atmospheric reanalysis datasets are widely used in climate science, many technical issues hinder comparing them to each other and to observations. The reanalysis fields are stored in diverse file architectures, data formats, and resolutions, with metadata, such as variable name and units, that also differ. Individual users have to download the fields, convert them to a common format, store them locally, change variable names, re-grid if needed, and convert units. Comparing reanalyses with observational datasets is difficult for similar reasons. Even if a dataset can be read via Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) or a similar protocol, most of this work is still needed. All of these tasks take time, effort, and money. To overcome some of the obstacles in reanalysis intercomparison, our group at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado and affiliated colleagues at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Earth System Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division (ESRL/PSD) have created a set of Web-based Reanalysis Intercomparison Tools (WRIT) at\nhttp://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/writ/\n. WRIT allows users to easily plot and compare reanalysis and observational datasets, and to test hypotheses. Currently, there are tools to plot monthly mean maps and vertical cross-sections, timeseries, and trajectories for standard pressure level and surface variables. Users can refine dates, statistics, and plotting options. Reanalysis datasets currently available include the NCEP/NCAR R1, NCEP/DOE R2, MERRA, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR and the 20CR. Observational datasets include those containing precipitation (e.g. GPCP), temperature (e.g. GHCNCAMS), winds (e.g. WASWinds), precipitable water (e.g. NASA NVAP), SLP (HadSLP2), and SST (NOAA ERSST). WRIT also facilitates the mission of the\nReanalyses.org\nwebsite as a convenient toolkit for studying the reanalysis datasets.",

            "abstract": "MIIC started as a NASA funded ACCESS proposal in 2011 to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a web-based tool to support LEO-GEO and LEO-LEO GSICS backed intercalibration studies. The initial effort demonstrated the benefits of using OPeNDAP and user developed server-side functions to provide efficient access to L1 SCIAMACHY, GOES-13, and MODIS data. Matched data in viewing geometry from instruments on separate spacecraft are subset, filtered, and transformed on remote servers prior to network download. The follow-on MIIC proposal will extend features for intercomparison of derived geophysical variables and data mining validation studies; as well as, demonstrate a significant reduction in data transfer to support climate model vs. observational data comparisons using OSSE data. Deployed MIIC services will provide access to L1 and L2 datasets from instruments such as CERES, CALIPSO, VIIRS, CrIS, ATMS, and GOES housed at the NASA ASDC and NOAA NCDC data centers. Data products must be in the HDF or netCDF file format. Server-side functions include 2DHistogram, N-Tuple, spatial and spectral convolution for data matching and synthesis. MIIC services accessible via a web page or RESTful API include event prediction, data acquisition, and analysis. Event prediction determines when satellite instruments meet viewing conditions over surface sites and orbit crossings. Matched data are automatically acquired and filtered using a combination of server-side and client-side functions. MIIC services advance interoperability of data located at the NASA ASDC and NOAA NCDC and reduce data required for analysis by several orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Volcán Baru, located in the western province of Chiriquí, is Panamas youngest and most active volcano. Although Baru has experienced no historic eruptions there have been four eruptive episodes in the last 1,600 years, the most recent occuring 400-500 years ago (Sherrod et al., 2008). In addition there have been four reported earthquake swarms in the last 100 years. The most recent swarm occured in May of 2006, prompting a USGS hazard assessment (Sherrod et al., 2008). Given its proximity to populated valleys on both the east and west flanks as well as to the coastal plain and interamerican highway 30km to the south, Baru presents a significant hazard. Residents of the small towns on the flanks of Baru frequently feel and hear earthquakes, yet there is no permanent monitoring network, seismic or otherwise, in place. In order to characterize local seismicity and provide a reference for future monitoring efforts, we established a seismic network that operated from May 2013 through April 2014. The network consisted of eight temporary single component, short period sensors generously loaned by OSOP Panama, two permanent sensors (one three component and one single component) funded by the University of Panama, and one three component broadband sensor owned by Angel Rodriguez. These were distributed over a 35 by 15 km area. Preliminary analysis suggests that local, M 0-3.5 events occur at the rate of 10-20 per month. Analysis of the earthquake catalog and the significance of shallow seismicity at Baru will be presented.\nSherrod, D.R., Vallance, J.W., Tapia Espinosa, A., and McGeehin, J.P., 2008, Volcan Baru—eruptive history and volcano-hazards assessment: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007–1401, 33 p.",

            "abstract": "Several federal agencies in north-central United States are each working to develop and disseminate useful climate information to enhance resilience to climate change. This talk will discuss how the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the North Central Climate Science Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Western Water Assessment RISA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Climate Hub, are building and managing a collaborative research and climate-service network in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. This presentation will describe the evolution of the interagency collaboration and the partnership with universities to build a climate service network. Such collaboration takes time and intention and must include the right people and organizations to effectively bridge the gap between use-inspired research and application. In particular, we will discuss a focus on the Upper Missouri Basin, developing research to meet needs in a basin that has had relatively less attention on risks of climate change and adaptation to those risks.\nEach organization has its own mission, stakeholders, and priorities, but there are many commonalities and potential synergies. Together, these organizations, and their agency scientists and university partners, are fostering cross-agency collaboration at the regional scale to optimize efficient allocation of resources while simultaneously enabling information to be generated at a scale that is relevant to decision makers. By each organization knowing the others needs and priorities, there are opportunities to craft research agendas and strategies for providing services that take advantage of the strengths and skills of the different organizations. University partners are key components of each organization, and of the collaboration, who bring in expertise beyond that in the agencies, in particular connections to social scientists, extension services.",

            "abstract": "The formation of the broadband aurora (such as seen at substorm onset) is well correlated with Poynting flux associated with dispersive scale Alfven waves that may be generated as a result of reconnection- or instability-driven processes in the plasma sheet. Ion temperature effects are important in this context as the ion gyroradius is a fundamental scale-length for the transfer of global scale substorm energy to particle energization and since these effects modify the phase speed of the wave (which affects both substorm onset timing and electron acceleration). We present simulations of dispersive scale Alfven wave pulses using a new gyrofluid ion-kinetic electron model in curvilinear coordinates. We find that consideration of a realistic ion to electron temperature ratio significantly reduces the propagation time of the wave from the plasma sheet to the ionosphere (relative to the case that neglects ion temperature effects) and leads to an increased dispersion of wave energy perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. Ion temperature effects also reduce the parallel current and parallel electric field within the wave and we elucidate the affects of this reduced coupling on the structure and evolution of the energized electron distribution functions for a range of plasma sheet wave parameters.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying pressure–temperature (P–T) trends across structural thickness provides insight into the tectonic mechanisms for emplacement and exhumation of orogen-scale ductile thrust sheets in active continental collision zones. Furthermore, these trends can reveal, via metamorphic discontinuities, the presence or absence of intra-thrust sheet structures. The Greater Himalayan zone (GHZ) contains mid-crustal rocks exhumed during Neogene convergence between India and Asia; however, the mechanisms that drove their emplacement and exhumation are debated. Within the Bhutan Himalaya, an intra-GHZ structure, the Kakhtang thrust (KT) is proposed to separate the GHZ into structurally upper and lower levels, and is interpreted to extend across much of the eastern Himalaya. In this investigation, peak P–T conditions were determined for rocks from two transects through both levels of the GHZ in north-central and northeastern Bhutan, in order to evaluate the significance of the KT, and to better understand the emplacement mechanism of GHZ rocks. The composition of the phases Grt + Pl + Bt ± Ms ± St ± Amp ± Kfs from twelve metapelite and orthogneiss samples were analyzed using the electron microprobe at UC-Santa Barbara. Peak P–T estimates, determined via THERMOCALC and supplemented by Ti-in-biotite thermometry, show similar T- but differing P versus structural distance trends across each transect. A gradual decrease in temperatures structurally upsection (~750 ºC to 600 ºC) was observed on both transects, and in northeast Bhutan, a steep decreasing pressure trend (0.40 ± 0.08 kbar/km) is documented. In comparison, in north-central Bhutan, a super-lithostatic pressure gradient (0.74 ± 0.16 kbar/km) is observed across >5.5 km of structural thickness, and is interpreted to represent >60 % layer-normal flattening strain, similar in magnitude to flattening documented in GHZ rocks in south-central Bhutan. The documented gradients show no significant change in P–T conditions crossing the KT, and therefore argue that the KT is likely not a first-order intra-GHZ shear zone. Furthermore, the super-lithostatic pressure trends favor large-scale, post-peak metamorphic flattening of the GHZ during emplacement.",

            "abstract": "The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and operations are designed to provide maximum reconnection science. Mission phases and the tetrahedral spacecraft formations are chosen to investigate reconnection at the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail. At the dayside, the orbits maximize encounters with the magnetopause in regions where the probability of encountering the reconnection diffusion region is high. In the magnetotail, the orbits maximize encounters with the neutral sheet, where reconnection is known to occur episodically. The mission will collect several gigabits per day of particles and field data. Management of these data requires effective selection, transmission, analysis, and storage of data in the ground segment of the mission. Following MMS launch, the Science Operations Center (SOC), located at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in Boulder, Colorado, will be actively responsible for instrument suite operations, as well as data production, management, distribution, and archiving of the MMS science data sets. Throughout, the MMS instrument teams work closely with the SOC in conducting instrument operations. The teams will be responsible for much of the science data production activities, with the SOC serving as the Mission Archive and the central node from which data are made available to the science community. The SOC will also handle raw instrument and spacecraft telemetry, calibration data, ephemerides, attitude and other ancillary data needed to support scientific use. Documentation and metadata describing data products, algorithms, instrument calibrations, validation, and data quality will be provided by MMS instrument teams and made available to the user community. A key component of ultimate MMS mission success will be the exploitation of high-resolution burst data products through an innovative burst system and the “Scientist-in-the-Loop” (SITL) concept for key interval identification, downlink, and analysis.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to reduce the magnitude of climate change due to GHG emissions has focused attention on how different sectors contribute to GHG emitting energy use. California has been a leader in climate change mitigation policy across the nation with its passage of the Global Warming Act of 2006, with a major focus on the energy sector. Directly linked to climate change, the Energy-Travel-Urban Land Use Nexus in California is well recognized and the density/compactness of land use is subject of 2008 state policy (Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act, SB 375). The Water-Energy Nexus is also well-recognized, given that about 19% of electricity use in State is water-related, and water scarcity in the State has led to increasing policy guidelines, e.g., the 2009 water conservation plan, with a target of reducing urban water use by 20% by 2020. Since 40-50% of urban water in California is consumed by outdoor water use, the character of urban land use, its compactness and density, have important effects on water use and resulting energy impacts. However, direct policy attention to the water-urban land use nexus has focused primarily on water-conserving outdoor watering devices, and landscapes. Direct policy on the character of development itself has yet to emerge, and adequate recognition of the interrelationships among energy, water use and the character of urban development has yet to occur. This paper reviews the research and policies on the water-urban land use link, as well as on the larger triadic relation. It identifies research questions, and policy issues that this neglected link poses to California and the nation.",

Field assessment is essential to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathways, which has been recognized to be challenging due to the heterogeneity of sites and uncontrolled site environments. Modeling of vapor intrusion processes can predict subsurface vapor and oxygen concentrations and indoor air concentration under various environmental site conditions. However, detailed experimental quantification for model validation is typically unavailable. In this work, we report our efforts to quantifying vapor intrusion pathways into a slab-on-ground building by integrating mathematical modeling with well-controlled field measurements under three different pressure and ventilation site conditions. Comparisons between modeling and field measurements include indoor air concentration, contaminant and oxygen distribution profile beneath and inside the building, diffusive and advective flux under different pressure and air vitalization conditions. In addition to typically identified key factors influencing vapor intrusion (e.g. the building construction, the properties of compounds, and depth to the source), we found several additional parameters, such as anisotropic property of surface soil, locations of crack, and dependency of reaction rates on oxygen concentration, are critical to evaluate vapor intrusion pathways.",

            "abstract": "Many migmatite domes are emplaced within wrench corridors in which a combination of strike-slip and extensional detachment zones (pull-apart, extensional relay, or transfer zones) focus deep-crust exhumation. The Montagne Noire dome (France, Variscan Massif Central) exemplifies wrench-related dome formation and displays the following structural, metamorphic, and geochronologic characteristics of a ‘transdome’: the dome is elongate in the direction of extension; foliation outlines a double dome separated by a high-strain zone; lineation is shallowly plunging with a fairly uniform trend that parallels the strike of the high-strain zone; subdomes contain recumbent structures overprinted by upright folds that affected upward by flat shear zones associated with detachment tectonics; domes display a large syn-deformation metamorphic gradient from core (upper amphibolite facies migmatite) to margin (down to greenschist facies mylonite); some rocks in the dome core experienced isothermal decompression revealed by disequilibrium reaction textures, particularly in mafic rocks (including eclogite); and results of U-Pb geochrononology indicate a narrow range of metamorphic crystallization from core to mantling schist spanning ~10 Myr.\n3D numerical modeling of transdomes show that the dome solicits a larger source region of partially molten lower crust compared to 2D models; this flowing crust creates a double-dome architecture as in 2D models but there are differences in the predicted thermal history and flow paths. In a transtension setting, flow lines converge at depth (radial-centripetal flow) toward the zone of extension and diverge at shallow levels in a more uniform direction that is imposed by upper crust motion and deformation. This evolution produces a characteristic pattern of strain history, progressive fabric overprint, and P-T paths that are comparable to observed dome rocks.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a high-throughput imaging spectrograph that uses an echelle grating operating at a high dispersion order to observe extended sources such as atmospheric airglow and auroral emissions at high spectral resolution. Instead of the conventional single slit this instrument uses four with appropriate foreoptics to image a long, narrow field of view of approximately 0.1 × 50 deg. By using interference filters for order sorting, this instrument can simultaneously observe multiple spectral features located anywhere in the visible band (approximately 300 to 1000 nm) at high resolution. The current implementation images the scene at 6 wavelengths (427.8, 486.1, 557.7, 630.0, 656.3 and 777.4 nm), but the flexibility of the design of the instrument allows varying the wavelengths of interest with minimal modifications. We have constructed two spectrographs to be located at different geomagnetic locations. This will enable tomography of atmospheric phenomena for full 3-D rendering of the volume emission. We will combine HiT&MIS data with data from LITES, GROUP-C (on ISS) and other ground based sources such as GIRO, HiTIES, HIRISE and CHIMES along with the 13 all-sky imagers operated by Boston University to form a more complete picture of the ionosphere.\nThis work is supported by the NSF grant AGS1315354",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component of the carbon cycle in freshwater systems and its elemental composition and molecular features determine its reactivity and thus its stability in the environment. DOM is particularly prominent in wetland ecosystems and can be exported through drainage into streams and ultimately the ocean. While DOM has been characterized through a great variety of analytical techniques, much focus has been placed on characterizations in oceanic environments and large river systems. In addition, multi-analytical approaches using advanced analytical techniques for the characterization of DOM in wetlands have been sparse. Here we present a comparative study of DOM from three, large, subtropical wetlands, the Everglades (USA), the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Okavango Delta (Botswana), applying a combination of optical properties (EEM-PARAFAC), high field NMR and FT-ICRMS. We basically confirm findings of other reports that many of the bulk molecular characteristics in freshwater DOM are shared by diverse aquatic ecosystems that can be very different in their environmental character. However, detailed analyses reveal significant variations in the molecular composition that can in most cases be controlled by site-specific ecological processes and watershed dynamics including fire regimes, external sources of sulphur, and hydrological drivers such as hydroperiod or degree of inundation. Differences and similarities between selected sites from the three abovementioned wetland systems will be presented in relation to their specific environmental characteristics.",

            "abstract": "How did the first subduction zone form? Most present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and/or preexisting zones of lithospheric weakness, which are themselves the consequence of plate tectonics (Stern 2004). In contrast, spontaneous plume-induced subduction initiation - suggested on the basis of numerical thermo-mechanical experiments (Ueda et al., 2008) and supported by data re-interpretation of how subduction started in Late Cretaceous time around the Caribbean LIP (Whattam and Stern, 2014) - does not require pre-existing lithospheric fabric, such as are created by active plate tectonics and is viable for both stagnant lid and mobile/deformable lid conditions. Here, we present first results of high-resolution 3D numerical thermo-mechanical modeling of plume-induced subduction resulting from mechanical-magmatic interaction of an ascending thermal mantle plume with old, cold, dense oceanic lithosphere. We demonstrate that weakening of the strong lithosphere by plume-induced magmatism is the key factor enabling subduction initiation around the plume head. A large plume head is required to overcome ring confinement, and subduction initiation is further favored when plume activity and lithospheric weakening continues for several tens of Ma. We further discuss possible implications of this scenario for modern plate tectonics as well as for plate tectonics initiation in Precambrian time.\n",

            "abstract": "Native-Fe grains form in basaltic melts at highly reducing conditions (<iron-wüstite), that are atypical for terrestrial magmas. Only three known terrestrial occurrences exist: 1) ~60 Ma basalts at Disko Island, Greenland; 2) ~20 Ma Bühl basalts, Germany, and 3) intrusions of the ~250 Ma Siberian Large Igneous Province (LIP). The reducing conditions recorded are the direct result of assimilation of carbonaceous crustal material during emplacement of the basaltic magmas at or near the surface. Native Fe-bearing basalts are useful natural analogues for studying PGE pre-concentration mechanisms, and the potential for PGE additions to magmas from crustal sources. Here, we present PGE LA-ICP-MS data for Fe-alloy, cohenite, and sulfide for a suite of Siberian and Disko Island native-Fe basalts, in combination with whole-rock PGE data for all known occurrences. The Siberian native-Fe alloys are characterized by highly variable PGE concentrations (1-30 ppm total PGEs), distinct low Os abundances, and PGE profiles similar to those of the nearby Noril’sk sulfide ores. In contrast, the Disko Island alloys are characterized by total PGE concentrations of 1-10 ppm and distinct positive Os and Re anomalies in extended PGE profiles. The Bühl basalts contain low PGE concentrations (~20 ppb). In order to understand contamination contributions, Os-isotopes analyses have been performed. Preliminary whole-rock 187Os/188Os data for high metal content samples from Siberia (0.33606 ± 37) and Disko (0.15402 ± 15) indicate high-time integrated Re/Os. The Re anomalies observed in extended PGE profiles of the Disko Island samples may reflect a potential crustal contribution to the overall PGE budget, through the addition of carbonaceous material. Whereas the Siberian samples contain abundant carbonaceous xenoliths, there is no apparent PGE contribution from crustal materials. Therefore, the role of crustal contamination is important in forming the native-Fe alloys, but the interaction of concomitant contamination, fractional crystallization, and native-Fe segregation varies according to location and style of crust-melt interactions within a LIP; e.g., lavas (Disko) versus intrusions (Siberia).",

            "abstract": "Specular reflections from Titan’s equatorial region have been detected using the Arecibo Observatory’s (AO) 13 cm wavelength radar system (Campbell et al., 2003, Science, 302, 431). Fitting the echo spectra to radar scattering models indicated that they originated from smooth surfaces with root-mean-square slopes of only a few degrees; on this basis they were interpreted as evidence for liquid surfaces. The Cassini Saturn Orbiter however has detected stable surface liquids only in the polar regions and not in the southern tropical regions covered by the AO tracks. High resolution Cassini imagery that overlaps with the AO tracks between the years 2000 and 2008 does not suggest the presence of hydrocarbon liquids and exhibits no apparent correlation with the 13 cm scattering (Black et al., 2011, Icarus, 212, 300). In this work in progress, we explore alternative explanations for the origin of these low latitude specular reflections and attempt to resolve this now decade old mystery. In particular, we use the accumulating Cassini RADAR altimetry coverage to compare the nadir backscatter at 2.2 cm to that at 13 cm. This nadir-to-nadir comparison allows us to constrain whether the southern tropical regions are also smooth and specular at smaller scales. We also plan to constrain whether these regions are representative of Titan in general or have unusually smooth surface by utilizing the complete Cassini altimetry dataset that includes observations dispersed around the globe. Distant Cassini RADAR scatterometry-mode observations suggest that Titan exhibits a greater nadir backscatter than expected from traditional quasi-specular plus diffuse backscattering models (L. Wye, 2011, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University), hinting that unusually specular radar echoes may be the general behavior for Titan. Additionally, we employ the long baseline of Cassini observations over nearly half a Titan year, to constrain the possible temporal evolution in backscatter that was suggested by the AO echoes. We will also update the comparison of the Arecibo tracks with overlapping Cassini imagery, both by incorporating new coverage and through improvements in determining the regions of overlap.",

            "abstract": "A new mixing parameterization for climate and weather prediction models is developed. The new parameterization represents boundary layer mixing, and non-precipitating and precipitating convection processes in a unified and physically consistent manner. The parameterization builds on a previously tested stochastic multiple-plume eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux (EDMF) approach. The new parameterization includes a realistic model for microphysical processes as part of the mass-flux parameterization, and a parameterization for convective downdrafts. A method to solve the mass-flux dynamics and microphysics simultaneously is developed. This method avoids the need for an iterative solution of the equations and is numerically stable. The new EDMF parameterization is implemented in a single-column model (SCM) and we show that the model is able to capture essential features of moist boundary layers, ranging from the stratocumulus, shallow and precipitating cumulus regimes. Detailed comparisons of a few important cases with LES results are shown to confirm the robustness of the present approach. This new parameterization provides an important step towards a fully unified parameterization of boundary layer, shallow and deep convection.",

The EARS, an active continental rift zone, appears to be a developing tectonic plate boundary and thus, has a number of active as well as dormant volcanoes through its extent. These volcanic centers can be used as potential sources for geothermal energy. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the Geothermal Development Company (GDC) began collaborating to monitor several volcanic centers, which have included passive seismic sensor deployments experiment. A number of seismological techniques will be applied to the data being collected at the four volcanic centers: Menengai, Silali, and Paka, and Korosi. In particular, we will identify long-period signals and tremor local using a time-reversal approach. Low-frequency earthquakes are interpreted as magma passing through conduits of the magma chamber and/or fluid being transported as a function of magma movement or hydrothermal activity. The time-reversal locations will help identify the margin of the volcano and caldera, and faults that could form conduits for fluids. We will also perform ambient noise tomography to image the magma chamber and the conduit feeding the volcanoes. The combination of the velocity snapshots of the magma chamber, low-frequency events, and long period events will help us interpret the activity of the calderas and volcanoes. Overall, all these techniques will help us understand magma movement and volcanic processes in the region.",

            "abstract": "The solar magnetic field enables the heating of the corona and provides its underlying structure. Energy stored in coronal magnetic fields is released in flares and coronal mass ejections (CME) and provides the ultimate source of energy for space weather. Therefore, direct measurements of the coronal magnetic field have significant potential to enhance understanding of coronal dynamics and improve solar forecasting models. Of particular interest are observations of coronal field lines in the transitional region between closed and open flux systems, providing important information on the origin of the slow solar wind.\nWhile current instruments routinely observe only the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields, a proposed airborne spectrometer will take a step toward the direct observation of coronal fields by measuring plasma emission in the infrared at high spatial and spectral resolution. The targeted lines are four forbidden magnetic dipole transitions between 2 and 4 μm. The airborne system will consist of a telescope, grating spectrometer, and pointing/stabilization system to be flown on the NSF/NCAR High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) during the August 2017 total solar eclipse.\nThe project incorporates several optical engineering challenges, centered around maintaining adequate spectral and spatial resolution in a compact and inexpensive package and on a moving platform. Design studies are currently underway to examine the tradeoffs between various optical geometries and control strategies for the pointing/stabilization system. The results will be presented and interpreted in terms of the consequences for the scientific questions. In addition, results from a laboratory prototype and simulations of the final system will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The social sciences and humanities are typically framed in terms of being completely disparate from the \"hard sciences\", and although this bipolarity is far from accurate, the skills required in each area are indeed quite different. In this short talk, the author discusses her experience in shifting from a doctoral program in environmental history to a doctoral program in hydrology. The experience of having to learn a radically new skill set is both frightening and hugely rewarding and requires a confidence in one's ability to master new and ostensibly insurmountable concepts and a dedication to pushing beyond the initial endless frustrations. But after overcoming these initial hurdles, it became extremely useful to have a broad background in the geosciences. Conceptualizing the impact of climate change on water resources in terms of human livelihoods, for example, is both necessary and productive to understanding long-term policy impacts. This broader framing of research questions is thus significant in moving beyond the sometimes narrow conversations that are had behind the closed doors of each academic discipline.",

            "abstract": "Modern research, particularly in areas related to coupled systems, big data analyses, and model development/validation, involves heterogeneous data inputs and derived data products: data come from multiple services, processing is complex and variable, and the derived products don’t easily fit back into any of the source repositories. Significant progress is being made in supporting the assembly, management, and publication of such complex collections, thereby increasing data reproducibility. The Sustainable Environment – Actionable Data (SEAD) project within the U.S. National Science Foundation’s DataNet program is one such service. SEAD is typical of emerging best-practice in terms of managing individual data items (typically files), organized into collections and described using an open set of standard vocabularies, which are then published as rich compound research objects. Such objects minimally expose basic discovery metadata that can be used to register them with third-party search engines but they also maintain the rich descriptive information and provenance at the fine grained level. In the past year, the SEAD project team has worked to provide mechanisms to ingest data directly from other data services and to interact with applications, thereby maintaining provenance links that would otherwise be lost through a download/upload trip through a file system. Further, in coordination with other DataNet projects, we’ve worked to capture and display metadata obtainable from the source service, and to infer research-object-to-research-object provenance from file-level information to support enhanced discovery. These advances begin to realize the vision of researchers working across an ecosystem of data services, but they have also highlighted a range of practical and theoretical issues that arise when it becomes possible to track research activities across multiple research/publication/data lifecycles. This presentation will describe the work that has been done in SEAD and between DataNet projects to allow round-trip integration from data sources through subsequent data publications and will highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in creating richer, higher-value services that leverage the ‘round-trip’ provenance and metadata that becomes available.",

            "abstract": "The question of what type of role scientists, or experts more generally, should play in policy debates is a perennial point of discussion within the scientific community. It is often thought that communication containing some form of policy advocacy is likely to compromise the perceived credibility of the individual scientist engaged in such behavior, with the possibility that it may also harm the credibility of the scientific community more broadly. Rather than evaluating statements in a binary fashion as representing either pure objectivity or pure advocacy, one recent model proposes that public communication by scientists should instead be thought of as falling along a continuum based upon the extent of normative judgment implicit in a statement. This approach predicts that as the extent of normative judgment increases, it poses a relatively greater risk to a scientist’s perceived credibility. Though such a model is conceptually useful, little empirical social science research has systematically explored how individuals form judgments about different types of advocacy to examine common assumptions about the relative risks associated with such behaviors. In this presentation, we will report results from a national online experiment (N=1200) that examines audience responses to fictional social media posts written by either a climate scientist or a television weathercaster. Following the above model, the posts represent differing degrees of advocacy defined by the extent of normative judgment implicit in each statement. In instances where a specific policy is advocated, we examine whether participants’ reactions are shaped by the extent to which the policy mentioned is congruent with one’s political ideology. We hope this study will serve as an exemplar of applied science communication research that can begin to help inform scientists and other experts about the potential implications of different communication options they may choose from in deciding how to engage with policy.",

            "abstract": "Global sediment data (Whittaker et al., 2013) and carbonate content data (Archer, 1996) allows examination of ocean sedimentation evolution with respect to age of the underlying ocean crust (Müller et al., 2008). From these data, we construct time series of ocean sediment thickness and carbonate deposition rate for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian ocean basins for the past 120 Ma. These time series are unique to each basin and reflect an integrated response to plate tectonics and climate change. The goal is to parameterize ocean sedimentation tied to crustal age for paleoclimate studies. For each basin, total sediment thickness and carbonate deposition rate from 0.1 x 0.1 degree cells are binned according to basement crustal age; area-corrected moments (mean, variance, etc.) are calculated for each bin. Segmented linear fits identify trends in present-day carbonate deposition rates and changes in ocean sedimentation from 0 to 120 Ma.\nIn the North and South Atlantic and Indian oceans, mean sediment thickness versus crustal age is well represented by three linear segments, with the slope of each segment increasing with increasing crustal age. However, the transition age between linear segments varies among the three basins. In contrast, mean sediment thickness in the North and South Pacific oceans are numerically smaller and well represented by two linear segments with slopes that decrease with increasing crustal age. These opposing trends are more consistent with the plate tectonic history of each basin being the controlling factor in sedimentation rates, rather than climate change. Unlike total sediment thickness, carbonate deposition rates decrease smoothly with crustal age in all basins, with the primary controls being ocean chemistry and water column depth.\n",

            "abstract": "The 11 March 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw=9.0) produced large displacements of ~50 meters near the Japan Trench. In order to understand earthquake propagation and slip stabilization in this environment, quantitative values of the real elastic properties of fault zones and their surrounding wall rock material is crucial. Because elastic and mechanical properties of faults and wallrocks are controlling factors in fault strength, earthquake generation and propagation, and slip stabilization, an understanding of these properties and their depth dependence is essential to understanding and accurately modeling earthquake rupture. In particular, quantitatively measured S-wave speeds, needed for estimation of elastic properties, are scarce in the literature. We report laboratory ultrasonic velocity measurements performed at elevated pressures, as well as the calculated dynamic elastic moduli, for samples of the rock surrounding the Tohoku earthquake principal fault zone recovered by drilling during IODP Expedition 343, Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST). We performed measurements on five samples of gray mudstone from the hanging wall and one sample of underthrust brown mudstone from the footwall. We find P- and S-wave velocities of 2.0 to 2.4 km/s and 0.7 to 1.0 km/s, respectively, at 5 MPa effective pressure. At the same effective pressure, the hanging wall samples have shear moduli ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 GPa and the footwall sample has a shear modulus of 1.0 GPa. While these values are perhaps not surprising for shallow, clay-rich subduction zone sediments, they are substantially lower than the 30 GPa commonly assumed for rigidity in earthquake rupture and propagation models [e.g., Ide et al., 1993; Liu and Rice, 2005; Loveless and Meade, 2011]. In order to better understand the elastic properties of shallow subduction zone sediments, our measurements from the Japan Trench are compared to similar shallow drill core samples from the Nankai Trough, Costa Rica, Cascadia, and Barbados ridge subduction zones. We find that shallow subduction zone sediments in general have similarly low rigidity. These data provide important ground-truth values that can be used to parameterize fault slip models addressing the problem of shallow, tsunamigenic propagation of megathrust earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow characteristics are known to be sensitive to changes in climate, but few continuous records of flooding exist to evaluate the response of hydrological systems to centennial- and millennia-scale climate changes. Here, we present sedimentary records from two oxbow lakes (Horseshoe Lake and Grassy Lake, Illinois, USA) in the central Mississippi River valley (CMRV) that display abrupt shifts in sediment composition and particle-size consistent with deposition by floodwaters immediately following inundation of the floodplain. The sedimentary record at Horseshoe Lake begins ca. AD 100 and displays five major flood events, with four of these occurring after ca. AD 1100. Situated 200 km downstream, the record from Grassy Lake begins later, ca. AD 800, and also shows four major flood events after ca. AD 1100. An analysis of synchronicity using Bayesian age modelling software shows high likelihoods that the four overlapping flood events occurred at the same time, confirming that these events resulted from flooding of the Mississippi River. The most recent event we record at AD 1840 ± 50 corresponds to the AD 1844 flood, the largest flood by discharge (37 m3/s) measured by the gauging station at St. Louis, Missouri, indicating that our sedimentary records document high magnitude flood events.\nTogether, our two sedimentary records show a major shift in the frequency of high magnitude flooding in the central Mississippi River at ca. AD 1100. From AD 100 – AD 1100, only one relatively subtle flood event is recorded, but from AD 1100 – AD 1900, four high magnitude floods deposited distinctive sediment at both sites. The period of infrequent flooding corresponds to a time of agricultural intensification and population growth in the CMRV, while the entire region was abandoned when flood frequency increased. The pronounced shift in flood frequency we observe in our records at ca. AD 1100 begins during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; AD 950 – AD 1250), a period of warmer and drier conditions in the central USA, but persists through the Little Ice Age (LIA; AD 1400 – AD 1700), when cooler and wetter conditions prevailed in this region, suggesting that the occurrence of high magnitude floods may be controlled by seasonal climatic parameters that remain poorly represented in proxy-based reconstructions and modeled projections.",

            "abstract": "Science data files are generally written to serve well-defined purposes for a small science teams. In many cases, the organization of the data and the metadata are designed for custom tools developed and maintained by and for the team. Using these data outside of this context many times involves restructuring, re-documenting, or reformatting the data. This expensive and time-consuming process usually prevents data reuse and thus decreases the total life-cycle value of the data considerably. If the data are unique or critically important to solving a particular problem, they can be modified into a more generally usable form or metadata can be added in order to enable reuse. This augmentation process can be done to enhance data for the intended purpose or for a new purpose, to make the data available to new tools and applications, to make the data more conventional or standard, or to simplify preservation of the data. The HDF Group has addressed augmentation needs in many ways: by adding extra information, by renaming objects or moving them around in the file, by reducing complexity of the organization, and sometimes by hiding data objects that are not understood by specific applications. In some cases these approaches require re-writing the data into new files and in some cases it can be done externally, without affecting the original file.

            "abstract": "The Belmont Forum was initiated in 2009 by a sub group of the International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research. The Belmont Challenge embodies the Forum’s central goal: to deliver knowledge needed for societies to take action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change. This is fostered through collaboration among scientists across the globe and by stressing the importance of co-production of knowledge associated with coupled natural and social systems. The Belmont Challenge was clearly aligned with other collective thinking processes within the research community and key knowledge users from intergovernmental bodies. Convergence of these efforts gave rise to the S&T Alliance for Global Sustainability and its initiative – Future Earth.\nCollaborative Research Actions, consisting primarily of multilateral research calls to address topics relevant to Future Earth, have been the main tool developed to address the Belmont Challenge and some early lessons emerged. First, obstacles faced by the Belmont Forum are similar to those met by scientists collaborating across traditional boundaries. Building shared languages and interests between various disciplines and across global cultures, remains difficult; this results in a persistent underestimation of the transformation required to move knowledge creation towards a truly global inter- and transdisciplinary science. Second, the diversity of organizations, cultures and practices within the Belmont Forum is the main source of its creativity and its challenges. While some convergence is needed to build coherent strategies and work efficiently together, diversity is necessary to design actions suitable for all partners regardless of their national research system and science-policy priorities. Finding the right trade-offs is a learning process that Future Earth is also facing; thus both initiatives are not only linked through funding relations but also through strongly intertwined learning curves.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake hazard and risk models often assume that earthquake rates can be represented by a stationary Poisson process, and that aftershocks observed in historical seismicity catalogs represent a deviation from stationarity that must be corrected before earthquake rates are estimated. Algorithms for classifying individual earthquakes as independent mainshocks or as aftershocks vary widely, and analysis of a single catalog can produce considerably different earthquake rates depending on the declustering method implemented. As these rates are propagated through hazard and risk models, the modeled results will vary due to the assumptions implied by these choices. In particular, the removal of large aftershocks following a mainshock may lead to an underestimation of the rate of damaging earthquakes and potential damage due to a large aftershock may be excluded from the model.\nWe present a case study based on the 1907 – 1911 sequence of nine 6.9 <= Mw <= 7.9 earthquakes along the Cocos – North American plate subduction boundary in Mexico in order to illustrate the variability in risk under various declustering approaches. Previous studies have suggested that subduction zone earthquakes in Mexico tend to occur in clusters, and this particular sequence includes events that would be labeled as aftershocks in some declustering approaches yet are large enough to produce significant damage. We model the ground motion for each event, determine damage ratios using modern exposure data, and then compare the variability in the modeled damage from using the full catalog or one of several declustered catalogs containing only “independent” events. We also consider the effects of progressive damage caused by each subsequent event and how this might increase or decrease the total losses expected from this sequence.",

Large differential stresses may cause fractures to dilate and become more permeable due to opening mode displacement or shear displacement along irregular surfaces. Topographic perturbations of the regional tectonic stress fields have been shown to be large enough to influence the distribution of fractures in the subsurface. Previous studies of topographically influenced stress distributions have suffered from a lack of spatially continuous characterization of the subsurface fracture distribution. Here we compare stress models that account for both topography and the regional stress fields to seismic velocity profiles. We find a strong correlation between failure potential, a normalized measure of differential stress, and the near surface seismic velocity structure. This correlation suggests that critical zone architecture is, to a first order, controlled by topographic perturbations of the regional stress field.",

Potential sources for the various compounds include biomass burning, biogenic emissions, and local industry. A subset of the observed species was enhanced during a new particle formation event, providing clues to the mechanisms driving small particle growth in this environment.",

            "abstract": "The development of renewable offshore energy in the United States is growing rapidly and wave energy is one of the largest resources currently being evaluated. The deployment of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays required to harness this resource could feasibly number in the hundreds of individual devices. The WEC arrays have the potential to alter nearshore wave propagation and circulation patterns and ecosystem processes. As the industry progresses from pilot- to commercial-scale it is important to understand and quantify the effects of WECs on the natural nearshore processes that support a local, healthy ecosystem. To help accelerate the realization of commercial-scale wave power, predictive modeling tools have been developed and utilized to evaluate the likelihood of environmental impact.\nAt present, direct measurements of the effects of different types of WEC arrays on nearshore wave propagation are not available; therefore wave model simulations provide the groundwork for investigations of the sensitivity of model results to prescribed WEC characteristics over a range of anticipated wave conditions. The present study incorporates a modified version of an industry standard wave modeling tool, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), to simulate wave propagation through a hypothetical WEC array deployment site on the California coast. The modified SWAN, referred to as SNL-SWAN, incorporates device-specific WEC power take-off characteristics to more accurately evaluate a WEC device’s effects on wave propagation.\nThe primary objectives were to investigate the effects of a range of WEC devices and device and array characteristics (e.g., device spacing, number of WECs in an array) on nearshore wave propagation using SNL-SWAN model simulations. Results showed that significant wave height was most sensitive to variations in WEC device type and size and the number of WEC devices in an array. Locations in the lee centerline of the arrays in each modeled scenario showed the largest potential changes in wave height. The SNL-SWAN model simulations for various WEC devices provide the basis for a solid model understanding, giving the confidence necessary for future WEC evaluations.",

            "abstract": "The moisture balance of the continental boundary layer plays an important role in regulating the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. Near-surface moisture balance is controlled by a number of factors including precipitation, infiltration and evapotranspiration. Measurements of stable isotope ratios in water can be exploited to better understand the mechanisms controlling atmosphere-land surface water fluxes. Understanding the processes that set sub-surface water isotope ratios can prove useful for refining paleoclimate interpretations of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope-based proxies. We present in situ tower-based measurements of stable isotope ratios of water (δD and δ18O) in vapor, precipitation and soil from the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, a semi-arid tall-tower site in Erie, Colorado, from July 2012 to September 2014. Near surface profiles from 0 to 10 m were measured approximately every ninety minutes. Soil profiles from 0 to 30 cm, the region of maximum variability, were sampled on a weekly basis and cryogenically extracted for stable water isotope measurement. Evaporation-proof bulk rain collectors provided precipitation samples at this site.\nResults show disequilibrium exists between surface vapor and soil water isotopes, with the top 10 cm of soil water approaching equilibrium with the surface vapor right after a rain event because of high infiltration and saturation at the surface. At this semi-arid site with little vegetation, evaporative exchange is the main driver for soil water fluxes as the soil dries, corroborated by soil Dexcess profiles showing progressive enrichment through evaporation. In addition, when nighttime surface temperatures are cooler than deep soil, as is the case in many arid and semi-arid environments, upward vapor diffusion from the soil leads to dew formation at the surface which then contributes to surface vapor values. We use these observations to constrain a Craig-Gordon evaporation model at the land surface to weight the contributions of rainfall, surface water vapor exchange and sub-surface vapor diffusion to soil water isotope values. This has implications both for modeling short-term gas exchange at the land surface as well as for estimating past evaporative conditions from proxies like cave deposits and tree cellulose.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Although still debated, spherule beds in the Barberton Mountain Land (~3.4 Ga) are suspected to represent remnants of impact-generated and ballistically emplaced silicate melt droplets [e.g. 1]. Such deposits provide the only window into the late stages of the heavy meteorite bombardment on Earth as their source craters have long since been obliterated. In order to identify a possible meteoritic component and, if successful, to discuss potential projectile materials, we are performing a detailed Os-W isotope as well as HSE abundance study on spherule layers from the recently drilled ICDP BARB5 core (grid location 25°30`50.76``S, 31°33`10.08``E).\nSamples and Methods: Samples were taken from a spherule-containing meta-sedimentary core section discovered between 510 and 512 m depth. About 100 mg of homogenized sample powders were spiked with a mixed 190Os, 185Re, 191Ir and 194Pt tracer and treated in a high pressure asher using inverse aqua regia, followed by conventional extraction schemes for Os and the other HSEs [4]. Chemical and Os isotope measurements (via N-TIMS) were performed in Vienna, whereas HSE measurements were undertaken via ICP MS in Bonn.\nResults and Discussion: Our preliminary Os isotope data reveal a trend between samples exhibiting high spherule to matrix ratios (187Os/188Os ~0.106 and Os ~0.4 ppm) and samples with lower ones (187Os/188Os up to ~0.304 and Os ~0.008 ppm). Notably, the most unradiogenic samples exhibit carbonaceous-chondrite-like initial 187Os/188Os and HSE ratios, whereas all other samples are clear non-chondritic. These findings support an extraterrestrial contribution in the spherules and can be interpreted compared to conclusions drawn from a Cr isotope study performed on similar samples [3], possibly representing a different impact event and favouring a chondritic projectile. However, further considerations based on precise Os/W ratio determinations and high-precision 182W isotope data, will be presented at the conference.\nAcknowledgements:We thank W.U. Reimold and T. Mohr-Westheide (Natural History Museum Berlin) for the BARB5 samples, which were obtained in an ICDP project.\n",

Fertilizer application is a major source of atmospheric NH3, particularly in intensive agricultural regions such as the Midwestern U.S. Quantification of NH3 emission from fertilized crops remains highly uncertain, which limits the representativeness of NH3 emissions that are used in air quality models. A collaborative study to improve understanding of NH3 emission from fertilizer application focused on [1] measurement of above-canopy NH3 fluxes from a fertilized corn field in Illinois using the relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) and flux gradient methods and in-canopy fluxes with the inverse Lagrangian dispersion analysis method, [2] estimation of NH3 emissions at the regional scale using a process-based approach with available archived independent variables, and the currently used top-down approach, in order to compare and determine differences in predicted spatial and temporal variability of NH3 emissions, and [3] performance of spatial analysis to determine spatial and temporal patterns of ammonia emissions and relate them to independent variables characteristic of land use, soil, meteorology, and agricultural management practices. NH3 flux was measured over and within a maize canopy from pre-cultivation through senescence (May-September 2014) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Energy Biosciences Institute Energy Farm, and data from the field study was incorporated into models to facilitate connection of local emissions with the regional scale and to improve understanding of the processes that drive emission and deposition.",

This VUV irradiance model is an iteration of the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM), an empirical model of the solar irradiance spectrum from 0.1 to 190 nm at 1 nm spectral resolution with a 1 minute time cadence. This latest iteration is called FISM-P, where the ‘-P’ suffix stands for ‘planetary’, and estimates mean daily irradiances from 0.1 to 190 nm for every planet in the solar system from 1948 to the present through weighted interpolation of earth measured proxies. In addition to daily irradiances, planetary 1-minute (flaring) irradiances are available if the planet is positioned such that the flaring emissions are observed by instruments at Earth or MAVEN EUV at Mars. FISM is optimized to use the best available proxies for each layer of the solar atmosphere (chromosphere, transition region, cool corona, and hot corona). FISM-P uses both interpolated earth proxies (the MgII core-to-wing ratio, H Ly-a and F10.7) and, when available, the MAVEN EUV measurements (H Ly-α, 17-22 nm, and 0-6 nm) for improved accuracy at Mars. FISM has already been successfully used as an input for ionospheric and thermospheric models for Earth, Mars, as well as comparisons of photoelectrons at Earth and Mars, and surface charging of the moon. FISM-P now provides the capability for similar studies throughout the solar system; and the in situ VUV measurements by MAVEN EUV will result in the most accurate VUV spectrum to date at Mars.",

            "abstract": "EarthCube is envisioned as a cyberinfrastructure that fosters new, transformational geoscience by enabling sharing, understanding and scientifically-sound and efficient re-use of formerly unconnected data resources, software, models, repositories, and computational power. Its purpose is to enable science enterprise and workforce development via an extensible and adaptable collaboration and resource integration framework. A key component of this vision is development of comprehensive inventories supporting resource discovery and re-use across geoscience domains. The goal of the EarthCube CINERGI (Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability) project is to create a methodology and assemble a large inventory of high-quality information resources with standard metadata descriptions and traceable provenance. The inventory is compiled from metadata catalogs maintained by geoscience data facilities, as well as from user contributions. The latter mechanism relies on community resource viewers: online applications that support update and curation of metadata records. Once harvested into CINERGI, metadata records from domain catalogs and community resource viewers are loaded into a staging database implemented in MongoDB, and validated for compliance with ISO 19139 metadata schema. Several types of metadata defects detected by the validation engine are automatically corrected with help of several information extractors or flagged for manual curation. The metadata harvesting, validation and processing components generate provenance statements using W3C PROV notation, which are stored in a Neo4J database. Thus curated metadata, along with the provenance information, is re-published and accessed programmatically and via a CINERGI online application.\nThis presentation focuses on the role of resource inventories in a scalable and adaptable information infrastructure, and on the CINERGI metadata pipeline and its implementation challenges. Key project components are described at the project’s website (http://workspace.earthcube.org/cinergi), which also provides access to the initial resource inventory, the inventory metadata model, metadata entry forms and a collection of the community resource viewers.",

            "abstract": "The Transverse Ranges within the structural province of southern California, an east-west trending active fold and thrust belt system, has rapid uplift rates that are capable of generating large earthquakes and tsunamis. This system to the west consists of north and south dipping reverse faults offshore Santa Barbara and Ventura (i.e., Pitas Point fault, Red Mountain fault, Rincon Creek fault). Ventura Avenue Anticline (VAA) is one of the fastest uplifting structure within this system has experienced nearly 2.7 km of structural uplift since fold initiation about 200-300 thousand years ago, yielding an average uplift rate of 9-13 mm/yr. Mapped and dated Holocene marine terraces between Ventura and Carpenteria reveal that large uplift events occurred at 0.8 ka and 1.9 ka; a recurrence interval of approximately a thousand years. The VAA trends offshore to the west and is buried by sediment from Rincon Creek. This sediment completely obscures the surficial expression of the fold between Rincon Point and Punta Gorda, indicating that Holocene sedimentation has kept pace with fold growth. Given the high sedimentation rate, each uplift event should be captured by stratigraphic rotation and onlap, and formation of angular unconformities. With that perspective, we acquired ~240 km-long very high-resolution (decimeter) CHIRP seismic reflection data from offshore Santa Barbara in the west to Ventura in the east, in order to examine discrete folding/uplift events that are preserved in the Holocene sediment record. CHIRP data together with re-processed USGS sparker profiles provide new constraints on timing and architecture of deformation offshore. A transgressive surface that dates back to ~9.5 kyr B.P is identified in seismic reflection data and dips landward; bending of the transgressive surface appears to be due to active folding and faulting. Observed onlapping sediments together with the deformation of the transgressive surface mark the onset of deformation while periods of the tectonic quiescence are recorded by progradational packages. We are able to identify 3 discrete uplift events above the transgressive surface along the VAA. Similar uplift events (3-4 events) are also observed along the Rincon Creek Fault offshore Santa Barbara.",

Without these there is a risk that biochar use could deliver negative unforeseen consequences. Key to biochar sustainability is the feedstock sustainability, which in developed nations can be novel due to the ability to process biomass locally.\nUsing field trial data and primary biodiversity assessments we modelled different sustainability indicators (local GHG balance, global GHG balance, local biodiversity, global biodiversity and local economic return) associated with four different biochar feedstocks (woodlands, hedgerows, Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) and straw) over 20 years for UK arable agriculture. Global measures included Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC).\nOur results showed that trade-offs are inherent. Local GHG emissions are reduced by use of straw and SRC, and increased through the use of woodlands. In contrast all feedstocks reduced the global GHG emissions. Local biodiversity was increased through use of hedgerows, woodlands, SRC and low fertiliser rates. Global biodiversity was maximised through high fertiliser rates and use of all feedstocks. Critically economic return was maximised through high use of woodland and straw, and substantially reduced when hedgerows or SRC is used as feedstock. The introduction of high (£52 t-1 CO2) and low (£11.44 t-1 CO2) carbon prices were never enough to shift a system between loss and profit.\nThis research demonstrates that the sustainability of biochar varies substantially depending on the scale (local or global) and the breadth of indicators included. Ultimately biochar is designed to have a role in solving global problems, but the decisions determining use will be made locally. Regulation to ensure biochar is used appropriately may be necessary.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scale interactions over the Maritime Continent (MC) may cause island-scale seasonal rainfall anomaly dipoles during the rainy season in association with ENSO: El Niño events are found to accompany increased frequency of a quiescent large-scale daily circulation type. These large-scale quiescent conditions in turn allow stronger island-scale diurnal land-sea breeze circulations to develop; the latter result in more rainfall over the mountainous regions of Java and increased subsidence over the coastal plains. A similar phenomenon occurs over Borneo, where rainfall is enhanced in the coastal regions, in which sea breezes head against off-shore synoptic-scale low-level winds.\nThis contribution builds on our previous work to consider the impacts of both the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and ENSO, in addition to the seasonal cycle, on daily weather types (WTs); here WTs are identified using cluster analysis over the MC, throughout the entire austral summer season. We investigate how strongly ENSO and MJO control WT frequency versus their modifying the circulation patterns of the WTs; both will modify air-sea interactions through changes in surface fluxes. Robust control of WT frequency is found, with the seasonal cycle being the strongest of the three effects, ENSO the intermediate one, and the MJO being least important. In terms of circulation patterns, ENSO is found to modify the circulation patterns themselves to some extent while the MJO does not.\nWe argue that these findings have important implications for sub-seasonal to seasonal predictability at local scales: predicting the changes in frequency of occurrence for a small number of weather types is potentially more tractable than the full, much higher-dimensional prediction problem. They may also allow a better understanding of air-sea interactions involving modulations of wind-driven surface fluxes associated with the seasonal cycle, ENSO and the MJO.",

            "abstract": "The death of the Martian dynamo ~4.1 Ga and sustained volcanism throughout Martian history place fundamental constraints on the thermal history of the planet. To explore the implications for mantle structure, we constructed holistic models of Mars that include the core, mantle, lithosphere/surface, atmosphere, and an atmospheric capture of Phobos in a collaborative effort begun at the CIDER 2014 summer program.\nFor our thermal model of the core, we employ an iterative solver and parameterized phase diagram to compute pressure, density, and temperature in the core for a variety of initial accretion temperatures and bulk compositions. We use this model to constrain core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature and heat flow.\nWe couple this model for the evolution of the core with a one-dimensional parameterized convection model for the mantle. The upper boundary condition is set by the state of the Martian atmosphere. We consider the effect of a distinct compositional layer at the base of the mantle that may represent dense magma ocean crystallization products or a primitive layer untouched by magma ocean processes. We find successful models that allow sufficient CMB heat flow to power an early dynamo and the potential of melt generation through extended periods of Mars’ history.\nIn addition to dynamo and magmatism timing, other diagnostics allow us to compare model outputs to modern observables. The mass, moment of inertia, and tidal Love number of our model planet are compared directly to measured values. Additionally, deformation and stress on the lithosphere due to internal volume changes and changes in surface loading predicted by our thermal evolution models could be recorded in the Martian crust. Finally, coupling temperature-dependent tidal dissipation affects Phobos’ orbital secular evolution and gives constraint on mantle temperatures. These constraints are discussed for the different scenarios of Phobos capture.\nWe present a suite of models that satisfy the constraints of mass, moment of inertia, dynamo power and shutoff timing in addition to outlining predictions and implications for the forthcoming InSight and MAVEN missions.",

            "abstract": "Sediment permeability and consolidation behavior are key parameters in governing the drainage state and thus potential for excess pore fluid pressure in subduction zones. Elevated pore pressure, in turn, is one important control on the strength and sliding behavior of faults. Along many subduction margins, evidence of elevated, near-lithostatic, in situ pore pressure comes from high seismic reflectivity, low P-wave velocity (Vp), and high Vp/Vs ratios. This inference is broadly supported by numerical modeling studies that indicate elevated pore pressures are likely given high rates of burial and tectonic loading, combined with the low permeability of marine mudstones.\nHere, we report on a series of high-stress consolidation experiments on sediment core samples from the incoming Cocos plate obtained as part of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 344. Our experiments were designed to measure the consolidation behavior, permeability, and P-wave velocity of the incoming sediments over a range of confining stresses from .5 to 90 MPa. We explore a range of paths,including isostatic loading (σ1=σ2=σ3), K0 consolidation, in which the ratio of σ3/σ1 is maintained at ~0.6, and the trixial loading paths designed to maintain a near critical-state failure condition. In our tests, load is increased in a series of steps. After equilibration at each step, we conduct constant head permeability tests, and measure P-wave velocities in a “time of flight” mode. Initial results from isostatic loading tests on hemipelagic mudstone samples from 34 mbsf document consolidation and permeability-porosity trends, in which porosity decreases from 69% to 54% as stress in increased from .5 MPa to 15 MPa, and permeability decreases from 8.1 X 10-18 m2 at 1 MPa to 1.1 X 10-19 m2 at 15 MPa. P-wave velocity increases by 486-568 km/s over this effective stress range. Ultimately, data from our experiments will provide a robust basis for quantifying fluid content and pressure from seismic velocity and fault plane reflectivity at this margin, and provide data to parameterize forward models of fluid flow and consolidation.",

            "abstract": "Mg to Ca ratios of the benthic foraminifer species Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi provide a great potential for reconstructing bottom water temperatures, especially from the lower end of the temperature range between 0 and 6°C (Tisserand et al., 2013). A set of core top samples from the Fram Strait and the Norwegian margin have been studied for Mg/Ca ratios in C. wuellerstorfi in order to establish a calibration relationship to the environmental conditions. In this part of the northern North Atlantic the bottom water temperature range between -0.5 and -1°C. For the calibration to modern water mass conditions, modern oceanographic data from both existing conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts and the World Ocean Data Base 2013 (Boyer et al., 2013) have been used. Benthic Mg/Ca ratios are relatively high suggesting a preference of C. wuellerstorfi to incorporate Mg below 0°C. Although no correlation has been found to existing temperature calibrations, the data are in line with earlier Mg/Ca data from C. wuellerstorfi in the area (Martin et al., 2002; Elderfield et al., 2006). The carbonate ion effect is most likely a main cause for the relatively high Mg/Ca ratios found in core top samples from the Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas, however, other factors may influence the values as well. Holocene records of benthic trace metal/Ca ratios from the eastern Fram Strait display trends similar to those found in other proxy indicators, despite the difficulties to constrain a temperature calibration for this low temperature range. In particular, the benthic B/Ca and Li/Ca records resemble trends in Holocene planktic foraminifer assemblages, suggesting to be influenced by environmental factors such as the carbonate ion effect consistent for the entire water column.",

            "abstract": "Io-correlated brightness change in Io plasma torus (IPT) has been discovered by Voyager and show an evidence of local electron heating around Io. However, the amount of observation data is still limited to investigate its detail properties. In addition, the clear Io-correlated change has not been detected by EUVE and Cassini observations. Cause of the Io-correlated effect is still open issue.\nThe HISAKI satellite was launched on Sep. 14, 2013 and started observation of IPT and Jovian aurora for more than two months since the end of Dec. 2013. EUV spectrograph onboard the HISAKI satellite covers wavelength range from 55 to 145 nm, a wide slit which had a field of view of 400 x 140 arc-second was chosen to measure radial distribution and time variation of IPT.\nObservation of IPT with HISAKI showed clear Io-correlated brightness change since the Voyager observation. The amplitude of the periodic variation associated with Io’s orbital period was found. It also showed long-term variation during the HISAKI’s observation period. Through the observation period, the amplitude was larger in the short wavelength than in long wavelength. The wavelength dependence suggests significant electron heating and/or hot electron production. The Io phase dependence shows that bright region is located just downstream of Io. These are evidence of local electron heating around/downstream of Io and consistent with the Voyager result. The brightness also depends on system-III longitude and has local maximum around 120 and 300 degrees. Based on an empirical model of IPT, electron density at Io also shows maxima around the same longitudes. This suggests that the electron heating process is related with plasma density at Io. Candidate mechanisms which are responsible for the electron heating will be discussed.",

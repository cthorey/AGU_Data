            "abstract": "As the quantity of data available from global, national, and regional arrays increases, it is easy to assume that adding more data to a tomographic inversion will result in a model that better reflects true Earth structure. New data are often immediately and semi-automatically incorporated into new models. Typical methods of testing models (e.g. predicting body-wave travel times) incorporate the same data that were used to construct the model.\nAs USArray passed through North America, it recorded many earthquakes within the continental interior, including several rare M > 5 events in the central and eastern US. These data provide an opportunity to validate global and regional tomographic models against new data. In this study, we seek to quantify the extent to which various tomographic models predict S and Rayleigh wavetrains for earthquakes recorded at regional distances (< 30 degrees) within North America.\nWe test the predictive power of several tomographic models by comparing synthetic data to observed waveforms using the time-frequency misfit methods of Kristekova et al. (2009). We also compare path-average mode-summation synthetics to spectral-element synthetics. We find that adding more data to a tomographic model does not always or everywhere improve its predictions of regional waveforms.\nWe also propose a novel method for testing and improving tomographic models by demonstrating that portions of the time-frequency phase misfit can be approximately linearly related to perturbations in the 3D velocity model. Using this relationship, we identify regions of tomographic models which contribute the best fits to our new waveform data.",

            "abstract": "I have two goals with my research.\n1. I proposed that sound recordings can be used to detect the amount of water flowing in a particular river, which could then be used to measure stream flow in rivers that have no instrumentation. My locations are in remote watersheds where hand instrumentation is the only means to collect data. I record 15 minute samples, at varied intervals, of the streams with a stereo microphone suspended above the river perpendicular to stream flow forming a “profile” of the river that can be compared to other stream-flow measurements of these areas over the course of a year. Through waveform analysis, I found a distinct voice for each river and I am quantifying the sound to track the flow based on amplitude, pitch, and wavelengths that these rivers produce.\n2. Additionally, I plan to also use my DVD quality sound recordings with professional photos and HD video of these remote sites in education, outreach, and therapeutic venues. The outreach aspect of my research follows my goal of bridging communication between researchers and the public. Wyoming rivers are unique in that we export 85% of our water downstream. I would also like to take these recordings to schools, set up speakers in the four corners of a classroom and let the river flow as the teacher presents on water science. Immersion in an environment can help the learning experience of students. I have seen firsthand the power of drawing someone into an environment through sound and video. I will have my river sounds with me at AGU presented as an interactive touch-screen sound experience.",

            "abstract": "Lunar swirls are enigmatic high-albedo surface markings co-located with magnetic anomalies. The existence of mini-magnetospheres has been proposed as a formation mechanism, making small-scale magnetic field interactions with the solar wind of interest. Using data from the Lunar Prospector, Clementine, and Advanced Composition Explorer missions, we develop three metrics for the identification of mini-magnetospheres: 1) presence of coherent magnetism at low altitude for magnetic field measurements taken in the solar wind; 2) directional field distortions that are correlated with changes in incident solar wind azimuth; 3) intensification of total field strength. These metrics are applied to four lunar magnetic anomalies with various reflectances and magnetic field strengths, ranging from fully developed swirls (Reiner-Gamma, Airy) to diffuse albedo patches which may or may not be swirls (Descartes, Crozier). Specifically, we compare magnetic field measurements in the solar wind to source magnetization models constructed from observations in the lunar wake and Earth’s magnetotail.\nBy applying these criteria, we confirm previous findings of magnetosphere-like phenomena at Reiner-Gamma. We also find evidence of these phenomena at Descartes and Airy, and propose that mini-magnetospheres may exist here. At Airy, very large upwind distortions are observed, comparable to the length scale of the anomaly itself. At Reiner-Gamma and Descartes, this distortion is significantly smaller, yet the average field strengths are higher, implying that the scale of distortion is linked to the anomaly’s field strength. Interestingly, at Crozier, the weakest anomaly considered, we do not observe this distortion. However, we do observe evidence of field intensification at high solar wind pressures (16 nPa).\nWhile Descartes and Reiner-Gamma are among the strongest anomalies on the Moon, and both exhibit magnetospheric properties, only Reiner-Gamma shows a well-developed swirl pattern. Similarly, Airy and Crozier both exhibit properties of magnetospheres, yet only Airy is clearly a swirl. This implies that even if some mini-magnetospheric characteristics are observed, this is not sufficient to create swirl morphology; distribution of the source magnetization may play a critical role.",

            "abstract": "Diversity and structure of the soil microbial community (SMC) significantly affects soil ecosystem services including, nutrient cycling, C-mineralization, and stabilization/formation of soil structure. SMC also responds to changes in soil moisture and chemistry. Stemflow, the concentration of precipitation to soils at the trunk base, is well known to alter these edaphic conditions near the stem. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the potential link between stemflow and SMC structure. Soil samples collected near stems of two tree species of contrasting stemflow character (Fagus grandifolia [AB] and Liriodendron tulipifera [YP]) were evaluated for changes in chemical properties and SMC structure via PCR-DGGE (denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis) in summer, winter, and spring. Variations within the SMC DGGE banding profiles were determined by GelCompare II software and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of dominant and unique DGGE bands was conducted to identify shifts in significant SMC organisms. Our results demonstrate that stemflow can alter edaphic conditions near individual tree trunks, and that temporal soil moisture trends, soil pH, PO43-, SO42-, and Ca2+ can further vary in response to species-specific stemflow supply characteristics. This, in turn, may explain SMC structural and diversity differences in the proximal area (< 0.5 m) of different SMC species’ near tree trunks. Specifically, SMC diversity (particularly bacterial) increases where stemflow resources are unevenly input for YP but decrease for AB which has more consistent stemflow inputs. Soil chemistry and microbial community differences between species’ proximal areas also indicate the potential for stemflow processes to influence soil pH, and therefore nutrient status, including SOM. Seasonal patterns in DGGE banding patterns and intensity further show that as stemflow characteristics change with canopy phenology and meteorological conditions, so do specific clades or species (e.g., ectomycchorizal and saprophytic fungi, or proteo- and actinobacteria).",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in precipitation forcing, soil moisture states, and model groundwater fluxes are first-order sources of error in streamflow forecasting. While near-surface estimates of soil moisture are now available from satellite, very few soil moisture observations below 5 cm depth or groundwater discharge estimates are available for operational forecasting. Radar precipitation estimates are subject to large biases, particularly during extreme events (e.g. Steiner et al., 2010) and their correction is not typically available in real-time. Streamflow data, however, are readily available in near-real-time and can be assimilated operationally to help constrain uncertainty in these uncertain states and improve streamflow forecasts.\nWe examine the ability of streamflow observations to diagnose bias in the three most uncertain variables: precipitation forcing, soil moisture states, and groundwater fluxes. We investigate strategies for their subsequent bias correction. These include spinup and calibration strategies with and without the use of data assimilation and the determination of the proper spinup timescales. Global and spatially distributed multipliers on the uncertain states included in the assimilation state vector (e.g. Seo et al., 2003) will also be evaluated.\nWe examine real cases and observing system simulation experiments for both normal and extreme rainfall events. One of our test cases considers the Colorado Front Range flood of September 2013 where the range of disagreement amongst five precipitation estimates spanned a factor of five with only one exhibiting appreciable positive bias (Gochis et al, submitted). Our experiments are conducted using the WRF-Hydro model with the NoahMP land surface component and the data assimilation research testbed (DART). A variety of ensemble data assimilation approaches (filters) are considered.\n",

            "abstract": "Houston and the surrounding Harris County have experienced the detrimental effects of subsidence even prior to World War II, to the extent that the land along Galveston Bay had sunk as much as 20 feet since 1906. One dramatic example is the Brownwood subdivision, a coastal community in Baytown where continuous flooding due to subsidence forced the area to be deemed unlivable and consequently abandoned. Thus, Houston’s changes in groundwater and compaction of its aquifers are of relatively high concern to those in the public (infrastructure), private (oil & gas), and international (Port of Houston Authority) sectors. One of the key questions related to the subsidence issue in Houston area is what are the contributions of sediments at different depths, and what particularly is the contribution from shallow sediments? To address these questions, University of Houston has installed a vertical GPS array in the UH Coastal Center in March 2014. The GPS array includes four permanent GPS stations with the antenna pole foundations anchored at different depths below ground surface (-10 m, -7m, -4m, 0 m). A special, double-pipe GPS antenna monument was designed for GPS stations with the array. This project was funded by an NSF grant and a UH internal grant. Five groundwater wells with the depths ranging from 2 m to 100 m below the ground surface were also installed at the UH Coastal Center site. This study will investigate continuous GPS and groundwater level measurements (March-November, 2014) at the UHCC site. It is expected that the GPS array will provide total information on subsidence as well as compaction of aquifers within different depth ranges (0 to -4m, -4 to -7 m, -7 to -10m, and below -10 m). Correlation of land subsidence and groundwater fluctuation will also be investigated.",

            "abstract": "Many outer Solar System satellites have surfaces dominated by water ice and a mysterious material(s) causing strong visible to ultraviolet absorption along with trace other compounds with infrared absorptions, including CO2 and organics. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the UV absorber, including tholins, iron oxides, and nano-sized metallic iron particles (e.g. see Clark et al., 2012, Icarus v218 p831, and references therein). We have constructed extensive laboratory analog measurements and radiative transfer modeling of the materials and scattering conditions that can contribute to the optical properties seen on outer Solar System satellites. We have successfully modeled Rayleigh absorption and Rayleigh scattering to produce spectral shapes typical of those seen in spectra of icy Solar System satellites, including those in the Saturn system observed with the Cassini UVIS and VIMS instruments. While it is easy to create these absorptions with radiative transfer modeling, it has been more difficult to do with laboratory analogs. We are finding that laboratory analogs refine and restricts the possible mixing states of the UV absorber in icy satellite surfaces. We have found that just because a particle is highly absorbing, as in metallic iron, if the particle is not embedded in another matrix, scattering will dominate over absorption and Rayleigh absorption will not be observed. Further, the closer the indices of refraction match between the absorbing particle and the matrix, there will be less scattering and more absorption will occur. But we have also found this to be true with other absorbing material, like Tholins. It is very difficult to obtain the very low reflectances observed in the UV in icy satellite spectra using traditional intimate mixtures, as scattering and first surface reflections contribute significantly to the reflectance. The solution, both from radiative transfer modeling and laboratory analogs point to embedded absorbing materials. For example, nano-phase metallic iron embedded in a less absorbing silicate matrix as meteoritic dust infall onto satellite\nsurfaces is one explanation. An alternative would be tholins embedded in the ice. Spectral features should be able to distinguish between these and other possibilities and will be explored.",

            "abstract": "Comparing ancient channel and floodplain deposits provides insight into long-term channel and floodplain dynamics in alluvial basins. Channel lateral migration and avulsion behavior may be affected by floodplain characteristics, including sediment cohesion, vegetation cover, and floodplain-drainage conditions. Channel-deposit architecture reflects paleo-channel dynamics; for example, channel form, migration, and reworking can be inferred from bar deposits, while multi-storied sand bodies can indicate a complex history of channel avulsion, reoccupation and migration. Furthermore, associated floodplain deposits can be used to reconstruct some aspects of floodplain sedimentation patterns, drainage, and soil development. In order to better understand how channel mobility may be linked to floodplain conditions, we compare the three members of the Paleocene-Eocene Wasatch Formation, which were deposited under broadly similar basin subsidence conditions, and straddle the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) climate-change event. These ancient deposits show varying styles of channel and floodplain deposits. The Atwell Gulch (pre-PETM) and Shire (post-PETM) members of the Wasatch Formation are both mud-stone dominated, with abundant, well-developed paleosol deposits. In contrast, the middle Molina Member is sand-rich and contains more weakly developed paleosols. Using terrestrial lidar scans and high-resolution photo panels of outcrops, along with detailed field measurements, we identify key surfaces (including bar-accretion, and story-bounding surfaces) and facies within channel deposits, and describe floodplain deposits within each member. Concurrent changes in paleo-channel architecture and floodplain deposits observed within the succession suggest that floodplain conditions are important controls on channel mobility in Wasatch rivers.",

We have investigated this problem in the context of redox resources within a single-species bacterial biofilm. We developed a mathematical model of oxidant availability and metabolic response within biofilm features and we show that observed biofilm geometries maximize cellular reproduction and growth efficiency. Our model accurately predicts the measured distribution of two types of electron acceptors: oxygen, which is available from the environment, and phenazines, redox-active small molecules produced by the bacterium. Because our model is based on resource dynamics, we are also able to predict observed shifts in feature geometry based on changes in the availability of redox resources such as variations in the external availability of oxygen or the removal of phenazines. This analysis suggests various avenues for understanding microstructure and the evolution of spatial metabolism in microbial mats. ",

We examine the potential of this constellation of air quality sounders to quantify the role of local and non-local sources of pollution on background ozone in the US. Based upon an adjoint sensitivity method, we compute the role of synoptic scale transport of spatially-resolved non-US pollution on US background ozone over months representative of different source-receptor relationships. This analysis allows us to compute potential emission trajectories of megacities, e.g. Beijing, or regions, e.g., western China, on downwind ozone. We subsequently explore how reductions of emission uncertainties from constellation observations could improve attribution of local versus non-local contributors to US background ozone.

It provides essential cultural, recreational, and aesthetic values and also plays a critical role in the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Recent analyses of water systems across the planet, summarized using high resolution, geospatial indicator maps of rivers, demonstrate that a wide array of stressors combine to produce a pattern of worldwide threat to much of the freshwater resource base that sustains human water supply and aquatic biodiversity. A pervasive, globally-significant pattern of management is evident in the contemporary setting, through which impairment accumulates as a function of wealth, but is then remedied by costly, after-the-fact technological investments. This strategy of treating symptoms while leaving unabated the underlying causes is practiced widely across rich countries, but it strands poor nations and much of the world's aquatic lifeforms at high levels of vulnerability. The seeds of such an approach to water management are hardly new and are evident throughout human history. This talk will explore the implications of these global realities and will focus on the role of 21st century engineering as in both contributing to the growing water crisis and stimulating innovation for more effective stewardship of our water resource systems. It will also present a first global synthesis of the geography of freshwater provisioning source areas, evaluating jointly the quantity and condition of freshwater produced from these areas, and the downstream populations served by these resources.

            "abstract": "An elastic backscatter light detection and ranging (Lidar) system emits a laser pulse and measures the return signal from molecules and particles along the path. It has been shown that particulate matter mass concentrations (PM) can be retrieved from Lidar data using multiple wavelengths. In this paper we describe a technique that allows for semi-quantitative PM determination under a set of guiding assumptions using only one laser wavelength. The Space Dynamics Laboratory has designed an eye-safe (1.5 μm) single wavelength elastic Lidar system called CELiS (Compact Eye-safe Lidar System), which is described in a companion paper, to which this technique is applied.\nData utilized in the PM retrieval include the Lidar return signal, ambient temperature, ambient humidity, barometric pressure, particle size distribution, particle chemical composition, and PM measurements. Particle size distribution is measured with an optical particle counter. PM is measured with filter-based measurements. Chemical composition is determined through multiple analyses on exposed filter samples. Particle measurements are made both inside and outside of the plume of interest and collocated with the lidar beam for calibration.\nThe meteorological and particle measurements are used to estimate the total extinction (σ) and backscatter (β) for background and plume aerosols. These σ and β values are used in conjunction with the lidar return signal in an inversion technique based on that of Klett (1985, Appl. Opt., 1638-1643). Variable σ/β ratios over the lidar beam path are used to estimate the values of σ and β at each lidar bin. A relationship between β and PM mass concentrations at calibration points is developed, which then allows the β values derived over the lidar beam path to be converted to PM.\nA PM-calibrated, scanning Lidar system like CELiS can be used to investigate PM concentrations and emissions over a large volume, a task that is very difficult to accomplish with typical PM sensors.",

We are leveraging access to 10+ PB of earth science data on Lustre filesystems at Australia’s National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) Research Data Storage Infrastructure (RDSI) node, co-located with NCI’s 1.2 PFlop Raijin supercomputer and a 3000 CPU core research cloud.\nThe development, maintenance and sustainability of VLs is best accomplished through modularisation and standardisation of interfaces between components. Our approach has been to break up tightly-coupled, specialised application packages into modules, with identified best techniques and algorithms repackaged either as data services or scientific tools that are accessible across domains. The data services can be used to manipulate, visualise and transform multiple data types whilst the scientific tools can be used in concert with multiple scientific codes.\nWe are currently designing a scalable generic infrastructure that will handle scientific code as modularised services and thereby enable the rapid/easy deployment of new codes or versions of codes. The goal is to build open source libraries/collections of scientific tools, scripts and modelling codes that can be combined in specially designed deployments. Additional services in development include: provenance, publication of results, monitoring, workflow tools, etc. The generic VL infrastructure will be hosted at NCI, but can access alternative computing infrastructures (i.e., public/private cloud, HPC).\nThe Virtual Geophysics Laboratory (VGL) was developed as a pilot project to demonstrate the underlying technology. This base is now being redesigned and generalised to develop a Virtual Hazards Impact and Risk Laboratory (VHIRL); any enhancements and new capabilities will be incorporated into a generic VL infrastructure. At same time, we are scoping seven new VLs and in the process, identifying other common components to prioritise and focus development.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative prediction of the shear response and energy partitioning in granular layers with breakable particles remains a major challenge in earthquake physics. As a first step towards addressing this problem, we use the Shear Transformation Zone theory (STZ) to model irreversible plastic deformations in the gouge due to local rearrangements of the particles. To model grain breakage, we use an energy balance approach to augment the STZ theory with an equation for the grain size reduction as a function of the applied work rate and pressure.\nPrevious numerical and experimental work on grain breakage was inconclusive regarding whether grain breakage was a softening or a hardening mechanism. The outcome depends on the competition between evolving grain angularity and reduced particle size with both processes affecting force chain dynamics. To account for local force chain instabilities, we develop a small scale model for force chain buckling that is integrated within the STZ formulation through variations of the minimum flow stress of the system. We idealize a typical force chain as an array of particles with both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The relative motion between the particles is resisted by sliding and rolling friction. The sliding friction is provided by a rigid-plastic element. The rolling resistance is modeled by a torsional spring. The deflection of the force chain is resisted by an array of lateral springs representing the effective confinement provided by the rest of the granular medium\nOur results suggest that there exist a critical grain size below which the buckling stress for the force chain, and hence the flow stress, decreases linearly with the decrease of the particle size. Furthermore, we show that grain breakage is a potential weakening mechanism at high pressures and at strain rates high enough to reduce the grain size below the aforementioned critical limit. Grain breakage also promotes strain localization, particularly in compact layers, and may explain the long term persistence of shear bands in natural faults due to the permanent change in the layer fabric resulting from comminution. We discuss the implications of these findings on the stability of sliding of natural faults and earthquake energy budget.",

The goals of this registry are to (1) provide a single source of synoptic information about the repositories, their component collections, access and use policies, and staff contact information; and (2) facilitate the assignment of identifiers for repositories and their collections that are globally unique across all disciplines. As digitization efforts continue, the importance of globally unique identifiers is paramount to ensuring interoperability across datasets.

Collection-level metadata categorize the types of contained specimens/samples and modes of preservation. In selecting the level of granularity for these categories, designers sought a compromise that would capture enough information to be useful in searches and inquiries and would complement the detailed archives in specimen-level databases such (which are increasingly digital) hosted by discipline-specific groups (e.g. SESAR) or the repositories themselves (e.g. KE EMu).",

            "abstract": "Pinpointing the sources of meltwater pulse (MWP) 1a—the most abrupt period of sea level rise during the last glacial termination—remains one of paleoclimatology’s greatest challenges, with implications for the understanding of rapid climate change, isostatic rebound, and past ocean circulation. Here, we present an annotated geomorphological map of a southern region of Svalbard, Norway, that we will use in the interpretation of a soon-to-be published  10Be chronology of this study area where no cosmogenic nuclide exposure data has yet been produced. From this map, we infer historic ice sheet thickness, flow rate, and erosivity. Together, this data will enable us to constrain ice sheet volume change over time in southern Svalbard. The map identifies raised beaches at an altitude of 40 m, indicating an ice sheet thickness of 400-800 m during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when compared to other shoreline data from the region and ice sheet models. We also observed an abundance of glacially smoothed features in valleys, despite an absence of such features at higher elevations. This could suggest a transition from warm-based, erosive ice to cold-based, non-destructive ice with increasing elevation. It is also possible that mountain peaks in this region were not glaciated at LGM. It is important to assess the historic erosivity of an ice sheet because cosmogenic nuclides may be inherited from prior interstadials when the bedrock was deglaciated, if not “reset” by erosion. This can result in erroneously old exposure dates. If this portion of the Svalbard Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBSIS) did contribute largely to MWP-1a, then we would expect exposure dates from sites differing in elevation by 100 m or more to fall within a 500-year range, centered around 14 ka. Expeditions to collect samples for exposure dating at other field sites in southern Svalbard, scheduled for the coming field season, will help to further inform our understanding of the SBSIS deglaciation and the MWP-1a.",

            "abstract": "We have implemented a parallel code that simulates earthquake cycles on a strike-slip fault in two dimensions. The fault is governed by rate-and-state friction with depth-dependent parameters. The upper portion of the fault, above the seismogenic depth, is velocity-weakening, while the lower portion is velocity-strengthening. The method uses a spatial discretization that accommodates variable off-fault material properties. To simulate tectonic loading, the remote boundaries are driven at half the relative long-term slip rate.\nPreliminary results suggest that material heterogeneity significantly affects system behavior in certain parts of parameter space. In a homogeneous half-space, events that rupture the full seismogenic depth occur periodically. In contrast, the presence of a sedimentary basin, represented by an elliptic region of decreased shear modulus and density, results in a more complex sequence of events. Two types of rupture emerge: sub-basin and surface-rupturing events. All ruptures nucleate at the seismogenic depth, but for the sub-basin events the rupture fails to penetrate through the basin to the surface. Each sub-basin event leaves a stress concentration at the bottom of the basin, the presence of which enables the next event to rupture to the surface. For deeper and more compliant basins, the number of sub-basin events required before the occurrence of a surface-rupturing event increases. We have begun to explore this, focusing particularly on the effects of varying basin depth and shear modulus. We are also investigating the effects of incorporating a lithostatic normal stress gradient on the fault and velocity-strengthening within the basin. Additionally, previous work was limited to a state evolution distance $D_c$ of 8~mm, several orders of magnitude greater than laboratory values. The parallel implementation allows us to investigate the effect of decreasing this value. Ultimately, this exploration will increase our understanding of how sedimentary basins affect the earthquake cycle.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphic and biogeochemical processes and hillslope morphology are partly controlled by the extent and degree of chemical weathering between soil and bedrock. The production of mineral specific surface area (SSA) via chemical weathering is a critical variable for mechanistic understanding of weathering and provides an interface between minerals and the soil carbon cycle. We examined two 21-meter deep drill cores in the Laurels Schist at 141 MASL (summit) and 130 MASL (interfluve) in a 900 ha first order watershed in the Laurels Preserve, a forested land use end member in the Christina River Basin CZO. In addition to mineral SSA, we report elemental and mineralogical changes through both weathering profiles. Despite highly variable bedrock composition, mobile elements (Ca & Na) are depleted within 3-5 m below the ground surface, which is consistent with the removal of Ca-Na-plagioclase ((Na,Ca)Al(Si,Al)3O8) at this interval; we consider this depth as a weathering front. The water table in both boreholes was ~123 MASL (5/2014), which is well below the weathering front, suggesting that weathering processes are not coupled with groundwater interactions in this system. Clay XRD reveals the presence of secondary phyllosilicates including vermiculite, illite, and kaolinite in the upper 3 m of the summit weathering profile, which are weathering products of primary plagioclase, muscovite, and chlorite. The currently available clay mineralogy results are consistent with the decrease in total SSA from up to 20 m2g-1 at the surface to <5 m2g-1 below 3 m depth. Within the first 3 m from the surface, citrate-dithionate extractable iron contributed 30-60% of the total surface area. Therefore transformation of primary minerals to secondary phyllosilicate minerals, involving leaching loss of cations, was partly responsible for SSA production, but iron oxides play a significant role in production of SSA above the weathering front. This observation did not differ between topographic locations, which may reflect that hillslope morphology predates the timeframe of pedogenic processes in this system. These findings suggest that the propagation rates of the weathering front and the trajectory and efficiency of mineral chemical weathering in producing SSA may be independent of topography over the time and length scales examined.",

            "abstract": "The concavity of an incising river system – a measure of the rate of change of its bed slope with increasing discharge downstream – is a commonly used metric in fluvial geomorphology. It is commonly used in assessing variation of factors such as uplift, climate, and rock type along a system in a qualitative way, and underpins a number of quantitative analyses in tectonic geomorphology, such as the normalized channel steepness index. However, the factors that fundamentally control channel concavities in rocky streams remain relatively poorly understood, especially in rivers that are undergoing transient response to a perturbation in their boundary conditions.\nHere we use a combination of field data and numerical modeling to demonstrate that elevated channel concavities are a common and shared response to the propagation of a convex-upward “knickzone” through a bedrock channel long profile. Simulations using the novel modeling framework Landlab exploring thresholded incision and saltation-abrasion theory indicate that the presence of the knickzone can perturb the relative sediment flux in the area immediately downstream of the convexity, allowing enhanced erosion there and systematic elevation of channel concavities in reaches downstream of this point. The reality of this effect is demonstrated using field and remotely sensed data from three sites – the Red River area, Yunnan, China; channels on the Ladakh batholith, Indian Himalaya; and the Fagaras Alps, Romania. All contain broad scale migrating knickzones, but the causes of the disturbances that produced them and scales of the systems differ. Nonetheless, the concavities of all the channels are all elevated in the same way downstream of knickzones, consistent with the modeling output. These results demonstrate the ubiquity of sediment flux effects on erosion rates in many natural channels, and have consequences for the way we read tectonic histories from landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane Irene (2011) made the first landfall in North Carolina as a category 1 hurricane and continued northeastward along the east coast of the United States. It produced copious rainfall along its track and was responsible for 41 direct deaths and economic losses around 4.3 billion dollars in the US. The Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used in this study to investigate the rainfall distribution of Irene. Compared with Stage IV rainfall, the WRF simulation showed the capability of reproduction of the spatial rainfall distribution. It was further proved through the comparison of hourly rainfall from the simulation and rain gauges. The two had a correlation coefficient of 0.62 and a root mean square error (RMSE) around 4.4 mm h-1. Through a Lagrangian approach in both simulated and Stage IV rainfall, it was found that most of Irene rainfall was concentrated in the front quadrant, especially in the front-left quadrant. The examination of the synotic-scale environment showed that a deep baroclinic zone was developed and strengthened in the front-left quadrant of Irene through the interaction with a mid-latitude trough, creating an environment beneficial for rainfall production in this region. The baroclinic environment promoted the extratropical transition (ET) of Irene, accompanying with more rainfall production in outer front-left rainbands. The rainfall amount in the inner rainband showed a strong correlation with Irene intensity through the lower thermal wind. A non-terrain experiment was set up to study the impact of topography (i.e., northern Appalachians) on rainfall distribution. Compared with the simulation using original terrain, the non-terrain simulation produced a slightly different track and reduced total storm rainfall around 100-200 mm in northern Appalachians.",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations have revealed a small-scale (< 1000 km) air–sea coupling in regions of strong sea surface temperature (SST) fronts (e.g., currents, eddies, and tropical instability waves), where the surface wind and wind stress are altered by the underlying SST. Surface winds and wind stresses are persistently higher over the warm side of the SST front compared to the cool side, causing perturbations in the dynamically and thermodynamically curl and divergence fields. Capturing this small-scale SST–wind variability is important because it can significantly impact both local and remote (i.e., large scale) oceanic and atmospheric processes.\nThe SST–wind relationship is not well represented in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models, and the relative importance of the physical processes that are proposed to be responsible for this relationship is actively and vehemently debated. This study focuses on the physical mechanisms that are primarily responsible for the SST-induced changes in surface wind and wind stress, and on the physical implication on ocean forcing through Ekman pumping. This study shows that the baroclinic-related changes in Ekman pumping are significant (first-order) over a seasonal (2003 winter season) time scale and that the meso-scale impacts are quite important over larger spatial scales. These findings highlight the need to consider the small-scale SST–wind relationship even in coarser resolution model simulation, which may be feasible to parameterize because of the linear nature of the baroclinic-related effect.",

            "abstract": "Approximately one third of Canadians and Americans use groundwater as their source of drinking water. Porous media aquifers typically provide significant filtration of particulate contaminants (e.g., viruses, bacteria, protozoa). Fractured media, however, does not provide the same degree of filtration, and in fact often acts as a pathway for particulates to migrate, typically at much greater velocities than in porous media. Fractured aquifers, therefore, are significantly more vulnerable to particulate contamination than unconsolidated porous media. Thus, understanding in the mechanisms of particle migration and retention in fractures is important for the protection and management of these drinking water sources.\nThe purpose of this work was to investigate the role of hydrodynamics on particle transport in saturated, variable aperture fractures. A 2D fracture was randomly generated with an average aperture of approximately 2mm. The fracture was inscribed into pieces of poly(methyl methacrylate), thus creating a pseudo-2D fracture (the xy fracture domain is invariant in z). Transport experiments using fluorescent microspheres (0.05 um, 0.5 um, and 0.75 um) were performed at 2.6 m/day, 26 m/day and 113 m/day and the resulting breakthrough curves were measured. These breakthrough curves included various shoulders and artifacts that were repeatable and could be used to evaluate the quality of a model.\nCOMSOL Multiphysics, was used to generate an average flow field through the 2D fracture by numerically solving the steady-state Navier-Stokes equation. In order to have a 3D realization of the flow field, a parabolic flow regime was assumed in the z-axis and used to scale the average flow field. Random walk particle tracking was utilized to generate breakthrough curves; however, the Brownian motion and local fluid shear mechanisms needed to be considered in addition to the standard movement of particles via the local flow field in order to appropriately model the experimental results. These results suggest that local hydrodynamics are important in defining the transport of particles through a fracture. We plan to discuss further applications, general statistics, and particle retention in fractures due to hydrodynamics and ultimately the role of fracture geometry in particle transport.",

            "abstract": "A promising energy storage option to compensate for daily and seasonal energy offsets is to inject and store heat generated from renewable energy sources (e.g. solar energy) in the ground, oftentimes referred to as soil borehole thermal energy storage (SBTES). Nonetheless in SBTES modeling efforts, it is widely recognized that the movement of water vapor is closely coupled to thermal processes. However, their mutual interactions are rarely considered in most soil water modeling efforts or in practical applications. The validation of numerical models that are designed to capture these processes is difficult due to the scarcity of experimental data, limiting the testing and refinement of heat and water transfer theories. A common assumption in most SBTES modeling approaches is to consider the soil as a purely conductive medium with constant hydraulic and thermal properties. However, this simplified approach can be improved upon by better understanding the coupled processes at play. Consequently, developing new modeling techniques along with suitable experimental tools to add more complexity in coupled processes has critical importance in obtaining necessary knowledge in efficient design and implementation of SBTES systems.\nThe goal of this work is to better understand heat and mass transfer processes for SBTES. In this study, we implemented a fully coupled numerical model that solves for heat, liquid water and water vapor flux and allows for non-equilibrium liquid/gas phase change. This model was then used to investigate the influence of different hydraulic and thermal parameterizations on SBTES system efficiency. A two dimensional tank apparatus was used with a series of soil moisture, temperature and soil thermal properties sensors. Four experiments were performed with different test soils. Experimental results provide evidences of thermally induced moisture flow that was also confirmed by numerical results. Numerical results showed that for the test conditions applied here, moisture flow is more influenced by thermal gradients rather than hydraulic gradients. The results also demonstrate that convective fluxes are higher compared to conductive fluxes indicating that moisture flow has more contribution to the overall heat flux than conductive fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Coastal response to climate events is very important for both socio-economic and environmental reasons. In order to carry out a correct coastal management program, it is important to provide realistic analysis of the natural variability and trend associated with climatic events (i.e. hurricanes, storms). In a scenario of rising sea level and increasing wave heights, the coastline will suffer huge impacts in terms of erosion and flooding especially with respect to low-lying regions that may partly or entirely disappear. This work deals with the analysis of a 22 year long wave buoy dataset recorded at Cadiz (SW Spain) and Tenby (S Wales, UK) with the objective of find the existing relationships between wave climate and coastal response. The analysis consisted in the characterization of winter wave climate, extreme waves and storms characteristics and distribution and their relationships with regional cycles (Teleconnection Patterns) such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index, the East Atlantic (EA) pattern and the Arctic Oscillation (AO), among others. Wave climate showed clear cyclic variations in average monthly significant wave height (Hs). Winter waves rapidly increased in height, reaching peak values (Hs = 1.2 m, Cadiz, Hs = 2.1 m, Tenby) between December and January. Energy patterns calculated using the equation of wave energy flux, showed average values of 37 kW/m and 155 kW/m respectively, during winter. In the same way, storm characterization in each study area was carried out using the Storm Power Index (Dolan and Davis, 1992) and five classes were obtained, from class I (weak) to V (extreme). Storm occurrence probability was 95% for class I (i.e. almost one event per year) to 5 % for class V. The return period for class V was 25 years and ranged from 5 to 8 years for classes III and IV storms, e.g. significant and severe events. Classes I and II showed a period of recurrence ranging from 1 to 3 years. For both areas high energy wave values were observed when neutral to strong negative NAO and AO phases occurred and also when there were abrupt changes moving between positive and negative phases without passing through a neutral phase. Beach response to storm events greatly varied along both investigated littorals, and essentially depended on the sequence of storm events and the beach morphodynamic state.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is expected to reduce streamflow in the southwestern USA due to reduction in precipitation and increases in evaporative demand. Understanding the effects of climate change in this region is particularly important for mountainous areas since these are primary sources of recharge in arid and semi-arid environments. Therefore we undertook to model effects of climate change on the hydrological processes in Valles Caldera (448 km2), located in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico.\nIn Valles Caldera modeling the surficial, hydrogeological, and geothermal processes that influence hydrologic fluxes each present challenges. The surficial dynamics of evaporative demand and snowmelt both serve to control recharge dynamics, but are complicated by the complex topography and spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics. Complex factors affecting evaporative demand include leaf area index, temperature, albedo, and radiation affected by topographic shading; all of these factors vary in space and time. Snowmelt processes interact with evaporative demand and geology to serve as an important control on streamflow generation, but modeling the effects of spatiotemporal snow distributions on streamflow generation remains a challenge. The complexity of Valles Caldera’s geology—and its associated hydraulic properties—rivals that of its surficial hydrologic forcings. Hydrologically important geologic features that have formed in the Valles Caldera are three-dimensionally intricate and include a dense system of faults, alluvium, landslides, lake deposits, and features associated with the eruption and collapse of this super volcano. Coupling geothermally-driven convection to the hydrologic cycle in this still-active geothermal system presents yet an additional challenge in modeling Valles Caldera. Preliminary results from applying the three-dimensional distributed hydrologic finite element model HydroGeoSphere to a sub-catchment of Valles Caldera will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), through a NSF-ARRA supplement, has enhanced the geophysical infrastructure in in the Pacific Northwest by upgrading a total of 282 Plate Boundary Observatory GPS stations to allow the collection and distribution of high-rate (1 Hz), low-latency (<1 s) data streams (RT-GPS). These upgraded stations supplemented the original 100 RT-GPS stations in the PBO GPS network. The addition of the new RT-GPS sites in Cascadia should spur new volcano and earthquake research opportunities in an area of great scientific interest and high geophysical hazard. Streaming RT-GPS data will enable researchers to detect and investigate strong ground motion during large geophysical events, including a possible plate-interface earthquake, which has implications for earthquake hazard mitigation. A Mw 6.9 earthquake occurred on March 10, 2014, off the coast of northern California. As a response, UNAVCO downloaded high-rate GPS data from Plate Boundary Observatory stations within 500 km of the epicenter of the event, providing a good test of network performance.\nIn addition to the 282 stations upgraded to real-time, 22 new meteorological instruments were added to existing PBO stations. Extensive testing of BGAN satellite communications systems has been conducted to support the Cascadia RT-GPS upgrades and the installation of three BGAN satellite fail over systems along the Cascadia margin will allow for the continuation of data flow in the event of a loss of primary communications during in a large geophysical event or other interruptions in commercial cellular networks. In summary, with these additional upgrades in the Cascadia region, the PBO RT-GPS network will increase to 420 stations. Upgrades to the UNAVCO data infrastructure included evaluation and purchase of the Trimble Pivot Platform, servers, and additional hardware for archiving the high rate data, as well as testing and implementation of GLONASS and Trimble RTX positioning on the receivers. UNAVCO staff is working closely with the UNAVCO community to develop data standards, protocols, and a science plan for the use of RT-GPS data.",

It is known that for parallel propagation mode the enhanced transverse fluctuations driven by the parallel EFI are resonant with the ions. In the present study, nonlinear properties of the parallel EFI are investigated using one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with various initial proton plasma betas. It is found that the protons in resonance with the left-hand polarized EFI modes are anisotropically heated and subsequently their resonant interactions give rise to the excitation of the ion-acoustic waves (IAW). It is shown that the intensity of the excited IAW is proportional to the values of the electron to proton temperature ratio. In addition, the presence of the unusual electrostatic modes driven by nonlinear behavior of the protons, especially for the lower proton beta simulations, leads to the formation of the suprathermal component in the proton parallel velocity distribution, although the parallel proton temperature does not practically change throughout the simulation period.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital resource in the country of Uruguay. Here we propose new methods using remotely sensed data for assisting ranchers, land managers, and policy makers in the country to better manage their crops. Firstly, we created a drought severity index based on the climatological anomalies of land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) data also using MODIS. The use of the climatological anomalies on the variables has improved the ability of the index to correlate with known drought indices versus previously published indices, which had not used them. We applied various coefficient schemes and vegetation indices in order to choose the model which best correlated with the drought indices across 10 sites throughout Uruguay’s rangelands. The model was tested over summer months from 2009-2013. In years where drought had indeed been a problem in the country (such as 2009) the model showed intense signals of drought. Secondly, we used Landsat images to identify winter and summer crops in Uruguay. We first classified them using ENVI and then used the classifications in an ArcMap model to identify specific crop areas. We first created a polygon of the classifications for soils and vegetation for each month (omitting cloud covered images). We then used the crop growing cycle to identify the times during the year for which specific polygons should be soil and which should be vegetation. By intersecting the soil polygons with the vegetation polygons during their respective time periods during the crop growing cycle we were able to create an accurately identify crops. When compared to a shapefile of proposed crops for the year the model obtained a kappa value of 0.60 with a probability of detection of 0.79 and a false alarm ratio of 0.31 for the south-western study area over the 2013-2014 summer.",

            "abstract": "There is no operational system to monitor drought-induced changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) -- the amount of water stored as soil moisture, groundwater, snow, and in surface water bodies. Existing drought indices, such as the USDM, rely primarily on meteorological and shallow soil moisture data. Measuring changes in TWS is difficult because in situ networks do not provide collocated measurements of all TWS components. GRACE satellite data can be used to retrospectively analyze TWS variations caused by drought, but cannot be used for real-time drought monitoring. Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments can be used to estimate TWS variations because the solid Earth responds elastically to changes in hydrologic loading. A decrease (increase) in TWS yields upward (downward) motion, which is apparent in GPS vertical position anomalies, u. GPS vertical position anomalies have been compared to the seasonal cycle of hydrologic loading. However, these data have not been used to monitor TWS fluctuations caused by drought, even though they have attributes that make them well-suited for this application: (1) availability in near real-time (2) widespread spatial distribution; and (3) sensitivity to both local (~10 km) and regional loading.\nHere, GPS vertical position data, u, are used to assess the timing and duration of TWS anomalies in the High Plains caused by the 2012 drought. u indicates an initial TWS minimum in 2012 consistent with GRACE TWS, several months after the most severe meteorological forcing. Standard drought indices show recovery from drought during spring 2013. In contrast, u indicates that the TWS anomaly intensified by approximately 15% during summer 2013, an interval when no GRACE data are available. Hydrologic observations indicate that depletion of groundwater, not soil moisture, is the source of the persistent TWS anomaly. Our results show how GPS vertical position records can be used to monitor TWS in near real-time during drought. TWS based on u complements GRACE data, given their differences in latency, sensing footprint, and error sources.",

            "abstract": "Constraining the thermal histories of sedimentary basins is fundamental to a range of geologic applications including tectonics, petroleum system analysis, and the genesis of ore deposits. Carbonate rocks can serve as archives of basin thermal histories through solid-state reordering of their 13C-18O, or ‘clumped isotope’, bonds at elevated burial temperatures. Here we present one of the first applied studies of carbonate clumped isotope reordering to explore the diagenetic and thermal histories of exhumed brachiopods, crinoids, cements, and host rock in the Permian Palmarito Formation, Venezuela and the Carboniferous Bird Spring Formation, Nevada, USA. Carbonate components in the Palmarito Formation, buried to ~4 km depth, yield statistically indistinguishable clumped isotope temperatures (T(∆47)) ranging from 86 to 122 °C. Clumped isotope temperatures of components in the more deeply buried Bird Spring Formation (>5 km), range from ~100 to 165 °C and differ by component type, with brachiopods and pore-filling cements yielding the highest T(∆47) (mean = 153 and 141 °C, respectively) and crinoids and host rock yielding significantly cooler T(∆47) (mean = 103 and 114 °C). New high-resolution thermal histories are coupled with kinetic models to predict the extent of solid-state C–O bond reordering during burial and exhumation for both sites. Application of these models suggests that brachiopods in the Palmarito Formation experienced partial bond reordering without complete equilibration of clumped isotopes at maximum burial temperature. In contrast, clumped isotope bonds of brachiopods from the Bird Spring Formation appear to have completely equilibrated at maximum burial temperature, and now reflect blocking temperatures ‘locked-in’ during cooling. The 40–50 °C cooler clumped isotope temperatures measured in Bird Spring Formation crinoids and host rock can be explained by both recrystallization and cementation during shallow burial and a greater inherent resistance to solid-state reordering than brachiopods.",

The CIRES Education and Outreach team at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at University of Colorado at Boulder and the NOAA Climate.gov team will present results of the new study that used the Quality of Relationship index (awareness, trust, satisfaction, usability, and control mutuality). This index was developed in the previous study and places a new emphasis on the experience of individual users from the four audiences in their regular work or home setting. This new evaluation project used mixed methods, including an online survey, usability studies, phone interviews, and web statistics, providing multiple lines of evidence from which to draw conclusion and recommendations.\nIn the session, we will explore how the NOAA Climate.gov teams used the literature review and new CIRES research to address underlying challenges to achieving the portal’s goals. The research in these studies finds that people seek information in ways that are complex and that they do so by consulting a vast array of technologies. Improved and different modes of access to information have, throughout history, been led by technological innovation, but human behavior tends to be constant. The NOAA Climate.gov portal improved its design informed by the first literature review and evaluation. We will discuss how the follow-up study will inform continual audience-focused design and innovation for maximizing the effectiveness of the multiple audience portal. ",

The region of ULF wave activity is spatially localized in the ion foreshock. Observational evidence of the ULF wave foreshock boundary has accumulated over the last three decades. In particular, it has been shown that the geometrical characteristics of the boundary are very sensitive to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) cone angle. In the present work, we aim at investigating the statistical properties of the ULF wave foreshock boundary. For this purpose, we make use of the first three years of magnetic field data from the flux gate magnetometer (FGM), and the plasma densities and velocities from the Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) on board Cluster (SC-1). A new identification of the ULF wave foreshock boundary is presented, using specific and accurate criteria for a correct determination of boundary crossings. In particular, the criteria are based on the degree of IMF rotation as Cluster crosses the boundary. To reconstruct the foreshock geometry, we use two different 3-D gas dynamic bow shock models. The ULF wave foreshock boundary is compared with previous results reported in the literature as well as with theoretical predictions.",

            "abstract": "The mixing ratio of methane in the atmosphere has increased in recent years for reasons that are not completely understood. Stable isotopes allow us to elucidate sources of methane due to the relatively distinct isotopic signatures from fossil fuel, biomass burning, and microbial sources. The Stable Isotope Laboratory at INSTAAR has been measuring δ13C of CH4 from a subset of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division’s Cooperative Air Sampling Network since 1998. Here we examine our 15 year record and show that since 2007, the global average atmospheric methane δ13C value has decreased by 0.08‰. This is coincident with an increase in the growth rate of atmospheric methane after a period of near steady-state conditions from 1999 to 2006. The decrease in δ13C of CH4 is evident at sites in the Arctic as well as in the northern mid-latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. There has been no change in the inter-hemispheric difference of atmospheric methane isotopes, suggesting that the increased emissions do not originate predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere. Likewise, Miller-Tans plots, which examine regional, higher-frequency deviations from the background signal, show that sources of methane have become depleted in 13C since 2007 across latitudes, implicating stronger microbial emissions (such as those from wetlands). We use a 3-box model (Northern, Tropical and Southern) to test scenarios of increased methane sources and find that increased microbial emissions from the Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions are necessary to explain the isotopic shift. Furthermore, because there is not a change in the north-south gradient of δ13C of CH4, and because fossil fuel emissions are primarily from northern latitudes, fossil fuel sources alone cannot explain the increase in methane emissions since 2007. This study shows the value of including stable isotopes in long-term, global observation networks to constrain sources of atmospheric methane.",

            "abstract": "The biochar community is excellent at pointing to individual cases where biochar amendment has changed soil properties, with some studies showing significant improvements in crop yields, reduction in nutrient export, and remediation of pollutants. However, many studies exist which do not show improvements, and in some cases, studies clearly show detrimental outcomes. The next, crucial step in biochar science and engineering research will be to develop a process-based understanding of how biochar acts to improve soil properties. In particular, we need a better mechanistic understanding of how biochar sorbs and desorbs contaminants, how it interacts with soil water, and how it interacts with the soil microbial community.\nThese mechanistic studies need to encompass processes that range from the nanometer to the kilometer scale. At the nanometer scale, we need a predictive model of how biochar will sorb and desorb hydrocarbons, nutrients, and toxic metals. At the micrometer scale we need models that explain biochar’s effects on soil water, especially the plant-available fraction of soil water. The micrometer scale is also where mechanistic information is neeed about microbial processes. At the macroscale we need physical models to describe the landscape mobility of biochar, because biochar that washes away from fields can no longer provide crop benefits.\nTo be most informative, biochar research should occur along a lab-greenhouse-field trial trajectory. Laboratory experiments should aim determine what mechanisms may act to control biochar-soil processes, and then greenhouse experiments can be used to test the significance of lab-derived mechanisms in short, highly replicated, controlled experiments. Once evidence of effect is determined from greenhouse experiments, field trials are merited. Field trials are the gold standard needed prior to full deployment, but results from field trials cannot be extrapolated to other field sites without the mechanistic backup provided by greenhouse and lab trials.",

            "abstract": "As the foundation of soil fertility, soil organic matter (SOM) formation and break-down is a critical factor of agroecosystem sustainability. In tropical systems where soils are quickly weathered, the link between SOM and soil fertility is particularly strong; however, the mechanisms controlling the stabilization and destabilization of SOM are not well characterized in tropical soils. In western Uganda, we collected soil samples under different levels of land use intensity including maize fields, banana plantations and inside an un-cultivated native tropical forest, Kibale National Park (KNP). To better understand the link between land use intensity and SOM stability we measured total soil C and N, and respiration rates during a 369 d soil incubation. In addition, we separated soils into particle size fractions, and mineral adsorbed SOM in the silt (2-50 µm ) and clay (< 2 µm) fractions was dissociated, purified and chemically characterized via pyrolysis-GC/MS.\nCultivated soil C and N have declined by 22 and 48%, respectively, in comparison to uncultivated KNP soils. Incubation data indicate that over the last decade, relatively accessible and labile soil organic carbon (SOC) pools have been depleted by 55-59% in cultivated soils. As a result of this depletion, the chemical composition of SOM has been altered such that clay and silt associated SOM differed significantly between agricultural fields and KNP. In particular, nitrogen containing compounds were in lower abundance in agricultural compared to KNP soils. This suggests that N depletion due to agriculture has advanced to pools of mineral associated organic N that are typically protected from break-down. In areas where land use intensity is relatively greater, increases in polysaccharides and lipids in maize fields compared to KNP indicate increases in microbial residues and decomposition by-products as microbes mine SOM for organic N. Chemical characterization of post-incubation SOM will help us better understand how microbes preferentially break-down SOM. Agricultural intensification over the past decade in western Uganda has depleted SOC, on average, by 1427 g m-2. In addition, depletion of organic nitrogen reserves in stable SOM pools corresponds with reported declines in crop yields and productivity in this region.",

The origin, drift and collisional history of such terranes can be addressed with an integrated magmatic, paleomagnetic and sedimentary perspective.\nThe Barroso Formation is a Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary sequence that outcrops in the western Cordillera. It is made of basaltic lava flows with interbedded pillow and marine sediments that was formed as part of an oceanic plateau associated to the Caribbean plate. Limited paleomagnetic results have suggested the existence of significant south to north terrane translation of this block from the Pacific.\nThis unit is intruded by numerous gabbroic, tonalitic and granodioritic plutons that record the formation of an oceanic arc on top of the plateau unit that finally collide with the continental margin in the Late Cretaceous.\nThe sedimentary record associated to this magmatic units has been included in the Penderisco Formation which widely outcrop as a series of lenses tectonically intermixed with the basaltic rocks of the Barroso Formation. Despite its extension, the tectonostratigraphic meaning of such record has been scarcely address.\nTwo different sedimentary members have been recognized within the Penderisco Formation. The Nutibara member include mostly pelagic and chemical sedimentary rocks and the Urrao member characterized by intercalation of sandstones mudstones and chert that resembles a turbiditic facies. The sedimentary provenance of sandstones beds associated to the Urrao member include mainly monocrystallyne quartz with undulose and straight extinction, plagioclase, minor volcanic and metamorphic lithics and significant contents of muscovite.\nWhereas the Nutibara member is interpreted as related to the oceanic drift of the volcanic terrane that include the Barroso formation, the turbidites from the Urrao member that include a bimodal arc and metamorphic ensialic provenance can be interpreted as a sealed sequence formed associated to the collision of the oceanic unit with the continental margin. Fourteen new paleomagnetic sites have been recently collected on the Barroso formation to refine the understanding of the origin and intra-oceanic drift phases.",

            "abstract": "More than 50% of global wetland area has been lost over the last 200 years, resulting in losses of habitat and species diversity as well as decreased hydrologic and biogeochemical functionality. Recognition of the magnitude of wetland loss as well as the wide variety of ecosystem services provided by wetlands has in recent decades led to an increased focus on wetland restoration. Restoration activities, however, often proceed in an ad hoc manner, with a focus on maximizing the total restored area rather than on other spatial attributes of the wetland network, which are less well understood. In this study, we have addressed the question of how human activities have altered the size distribution and spatial organization of wetlands over the Prairie Pothole Region of the Des Moines Lobe using high-resolution LIDAR data. Our results show that as well as the generally accepted 90% loss of depressional wetland area, there has been a disproportionate loss of both smaller and larger wetlands, with a marked alteration of the historical power-law relationship observed between wetland size and frequency and a resulting homogenization of the wetland size distribution. In addition, our results show significant decreases in perimeter-to-area ratios, increased mean distances between wetlands, particularly between smaller wetlands, and a reduced likelihood that current wetlands will be located in upland areas. Such patterns of loss can lead to disproportionate losses of ecosystem services, as smaller wetlands with larger perimeter-to-area ratios have been found to provide higher rates of biogeochemical processing and groundwater recharge, while increased mean distances between wetlands hinder species migration and thus negatively impact biodiversity. These results suggest the need to gear restoration efforts towards understanding and recreating the size distribution and spatial organization of historical wetlands, rather than focusing primarily on an increase in overall area.",

            "abstract": "Current global climate models predict climate change caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will result in altered precipitation regimes by the end of the 21st century. Although there is still uncertainty regarding how mean annual rainfall will change in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., it is predicted that there will be larger rainfall events followed by extended dry periods. How this will affect greenhouse gas emissions across the landscape remains unclear. Here, we investigate the response of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from soil cores taken from a riparian-upland transect in southwest Virginia to changes in simulated rainfall magnitude and frequency. A preliminary experiment was conducted in early spring 2014 using soil cores collected in a riparian wetland in Virginia Tech’s StREAM Lab. These cores were divided into three different treatment groups. Each group received the same total amount of water, but the magnitude and frequency of the application of water was altered to simulate a single large storm event, three medium storm events, or seven small storm events. Concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the chamber headspace were measured with a cavity ring-down spectrometer and used to calculate fluxes from the soil cores. Our preliminary results suggest that larger storm events result in greater temporary suppression of CO2 emissions, and higher temporal resolution is needed to fully characterize the response of N2O emissions to storm events. In late summer 2014, additional soil cores will be taken from three different zones along a riparian-upland transect, divided into treatment groups, and subjected to a refined version of the previously mentioned experimental procedures. Additionally, the soil from the three different zones will be characterized with chemical and physical methods. Statistical analyses will be performed to compare the effects of the different treatments and to determine the controls on the response of the soil cores. These results will provide insight into possible feedback loops that may exist between soil greenhouse gas emissions and altered precipitation regimes resulting from climate change.",

It has long been conjectured that stomata has evolved so as to allow terrestrial plants to assimilate CO2 in a desiccating atmosphere while minimizing water losses. Hence, the hypothesis that stomata adapt optimally to their environment so as to maximize assimilation (A) for a given amount of water loss has received significant attention over the past 4 decades. Here, a new approach to implement optimization theory of stomatal conductance into a dynamic canopy gas exchange model is introduced. A key variable in this theory is the so-called marginal water use efficiency (MWUE), which is assumed to be constant on time scales commensurate with fluctuations in stomatal aperture. However, on time scales relevant to crop productivity (daily to seasonal), the boundary conditions on the optimization problem evolve in time prompting the question of how to assign MWUE on such time scales. To address this question, MWUE was formulated as a function of time-integrated leaf-water potential and atmospheric CO2. Next, leaf water potential was linked to root and soil pressure using a soil water balance model based on a modified Richards' equation that considers vertical distribution of root water uptake. The adequacy of the new approach was tested by comparing predicted diurnal cycles of A and E as well as variability of soil moisture with long-term observations at a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv.Cubus) field in southwest Germany (see Figure), where transpiration and assimilation rates were derived from eddy-covariance measurements of latent heat flux and net ecosystem exchange. To place those results in the broader context of climate change and food security issues, a sensitivity analyses on water and carbon fluxes with respect to climatic variables, soil texture, and root-density distribution is also presented.",

            "abstract": "While energy links all living and non-living systems, the integration of energy, the environment, and society is often not clearly represented in 9 – 12 classrooms and informal learning venues. However, objective public learning that integrates these components is essential for improving public environmental literacy. ENERGY-NET (Energy, Environment and Society Learning Network) is a National Science Foundation funded initiative that uses an Earth Systems Science framework to guide experimental learning for high school students and to improve public learning opportunities regarding the energy-environment-society nexus in a Museum setting. One of the primary objectives of the ENERGY-NET project is to develop a rich set of experimental learning activities that are presented as exhibits at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA). Here we detail the evolution of the ENERGY-NET exhibit building process and the subsequent evolution of exhibit content over the past three years. While preliminary plans included the development of five “exploration stations” (i.e., traveling activity carts) per calendar year, the opportunity arose to create a single, larger topical exhibit per semester, which was assumed to have a greater impact on museum visitors. Evaluative assessments conducted to date reveal important practices to be incorporated into ongoing exhibit development: 1) Undergraduate mentors and teen exhibit developers should receive additional content training to allow richer exhibit materials. 2) The development process should be distributed over as long a time period as possible and emphasize iteration. This project can serve as a model for other collaborations between geoscience departments and museums. In particular, these practices may streamline development of public presentations and increase the effectiveness of experimental learning activities.",

            "abstract": "Helium isotopes are used as a tracer for primitive reservoirs that have persisted in the Earth’s mantle. Basalts erupted at several intraplate oceanic islands, including Hawaii, Iceland, Galapagos and Samoa, have hosted the highest 3He/4He ratios (> 30 Ra, where Ra is atmospheric 3He/4He ratio) globally that are far in excess of the 3He/4He typical of the upper mantle sampled at mid-ocean ridges (8 Ra). These lavas have been suggested to be melts of a primitive, or possibly slightly depleted, mantle reservoir, i.e., either fertile or a depleted peridotite. We report evidence for geochemical enrichment in the high 3He/4He mantle sampled by lavas with the highest 3He/4He from Hawaii, Samoa and possibly Galapagos. The titanium concentrations in high 3He/4He lavas from Samoa are too high to be explained by melts of a mantle peridotite, even at infinitesimally small degrees of melting, and the elevated Ti corresponds to elevated Pb-isotopic ratios. The highest 3He/4He lavas from Loihi, Hawaii have Ti concentrations that are too high to be melts of primitive mantle peridotite at the degrees of melt extraction proposed for those ocean islands. Thus, Ti-rich material must have been added to the high 3He/4He mantle reservoir, and this material is likely to be recycled mafic crust similar to MORB-like eclogite, which is consistent with the elevated Pb-isotopic ratios. We show that fractionation corrected, major element compositions of high 3He/4He alkalic lavas can be satisfactorily modeled by melting and melt-rock interaction scenario in a fertile peridotite-MORB-eclogite hybrid system. Primitive peridotitic and recycled eclogitic reservoirs are suggested to be intimately associated in the deepest mantle and far from being primitive, the high 3He/4He lavas may sample a mantle source that hosts a component of recycled oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic activity of the Lau and North Fiji backarc basins in the South Pacific is complex and not well delimited. Rapid subduction of the Pacific plate at the Tonga trench, together with rifting between the Tonga and Australian plates and Niuafo'ou microplate, has created multiple types of volcanic activity as a function of this complex tectonic setting (1). In addition to extensional volcanism producing depleted mantle melt (2), a number of hotspots (Samoa, Rurutu, Rarotonga, Macdonald and Louisville) have passed near the area, each at distinct time periods, possibly contributing mantle plume components to the magmatism of the Lau Basin. During the summer of 2013, three transects in the Lau Basin and southwest of Samoa were dredged onboard the R/V Roger Revelle (Expedition RR1310). We present here the results of 10 new step heating experiments by the 40Ar/39Ar method using the ARGUS-VI multi-collector mass spectrometer, comprising groundmass and plagioclase separates from 9 basalt samples. These high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages will allow us to determine whether some of the volcanic activity in the Lau Basin correlates with known ages of hotspot transits through the area, clarifying evidence from corresponding geochemical analyses for a subset of these samples, which support incorporation of Samoan (EMII), Rurutu (HIMU), and Rarotonga (EMI) mantle components into spreading center volcanism across a larger area than previously reported (presented by Price et al., this volume). These ages thus provide insights into the complex construction of the Lau Basin through time.\n1. Zellmer, K.E.; Taylor, B.

            "abstract": "The Vienna Basin in the northeastern part of Austria between the Eastern Alps and the West Carpathians is a pull-apart basin crossed by the Danube river. The structure is filled with marine and terrestrial sediments showing thicknesses of up to 6 km. An increase in glacial melt water discharges, typically linked to high productivity of Alpine glaciers, had an essential impact on the formation of the investigated terrace. The scale of erosion and sediment transport translates to deposition rates in the foreland and is influenced by the magnitude of melt water discharges in Alpine catchment areas. Variations in layer characteristics (i.e. grain size, sorting, thickness) are an indicator for glacial pulses. Burial dates of ten quartz pebbles originating from the Gaenserndorfer terrace, situated in the northeastern part of the basin, set time dependent constraints on the required hydrological regime for mobilization, transport and sedimentation of bedloads and allow relating the deposition of glacial sediments to past glacial periods. But the geomorphic evolution of the Vienna Basin was not only determined by sedimentation processes. A number of irregularities manifest that tectonics affected the area as well: Terrace tilts are dipping against the slope of the Danube and offsets of some decameters between sediment layers showing the same facies, but located several kilometers apart from each other, could be identified. An extensive Miocene fault system was partly reactivated during the Middle Pleistocene and could have caused the formation of these discontinuities. It is of great interest to discriminate impacts on the area due to deposition from morphological elements formed by seismic events. The preliminary burial ages afford for putting the sampled terrace segment into a coherent geochronological context and provide a dataset to compare ages of the Gaenserndofer terrace to ages of sediment layers at other locations within the basin in order to either validate or reject the hypothesis that they belong to the same stratigraphical unit. The dating of the terrace helps to analyze the processes dominating this complex area and can contribute to a better understanding of the prevalent climate conditions in the Alps, the Alpine foreland and the inner Alpine basins during the Quaternary.",

            "abstract": "We systematically mapped (scales >1:500) the surface rupture of the 4 April 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor–Cucapah earthquake through Sierra Cucapah to understand how faults with similar structural and lithologic characteristics control rupture zone fabric, which is here defined by the thickness, distribution and internal configuration of shearing in a rupture zone. Fault zone architecture and master fault dip showed the strongest controls on rupture zone fabric. Highly localized slip was observed along simple narrow fault cores (<20 m), whereas wide cores (>>50 m) composed of multiple zones of high shear strain had wider and more complex rupture zones that generally lacked principal-displacement scarps. Rupture zone thickness also increases systematically with decreasing fault zone dip. We observed that coseismic slip along faults that dip >40° was mostly confined to the fault core, whereas faults that dip as low as 20° had surface rupture entirely developed entirely outside of the fault zone. The lack of large off-fault strain along faults dipping >40° is contrary to predictions by dynamic stress modeling (e.g., Ma, 2009). We show that static tectonic loading, which varies significantly with fault orientation, has a significant effect not only on rupture zone fabric but also on the evolution of fault zone architecture in this transtensional setting.\nRupture zones in undeformed alluvium are dominated by secondary fractures associated with fault-tip propagation, and arrays of fault scarps become wider and more complex with oblique slip compared to pure normal dip-slip or pure strike-slip. Field relations show that as magnitude of coseismic slip increases from 0 to 60 cm, the linkages between kinematically distinct fracture sets increases systematically to the point of forming a through going principal scarp, which is contrary to many analogue models (e.g., Tchalencko, 1970; Naylor et al., 1995) Our data indicate that secondary faults and penetrative off-fault strain continue to accommodate the oblique kinematics of coseismic slip after the formation of a through going principal scarp.",

            "abstract": "Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) calls for students across grade levels to understand climate change and its impacts. To achieve this goal, the NSF-sponsored PolarTREC program paired an educator with scientists studying carbon cycling in the Arctic. The data collection and fieldwork performed by the team will form the basis of hands-on science learning in the classroom and will be incorporated into informal outreach sessions in the community.\nOver a 16-day period, the educator was stationed at Toolik Field Station in the High Arctic. (Toolik is run by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Institute of Arctic Biology.) She participated in a project that analyzed the effects of sunlight and microbial content on carbon production in Artic watersheds. Data collected will be used to introduce the following NGSS standards into the middle-school science curriculum: 1) Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence.\n2) Develop a model to explain cycling of water. 3) Develop and use a model to describe phenomena. 4) Analyze and interpret data. 5) A change in one system causes and effect in other systems. Lessons can be telescoped to meet the needs of classrooms in higher or lower grades. Through these activities, students will learn strategies to model an aspect of carbon cycling, interpret authentic scientific data collected in the field, and conduct geoscience research on carbon cycling.\nCommunity outreach sessions are also an effective method to introduce and discuss the importance of geoscience education. Informal discussions of firsthand experience gained during fieldwork can help communicate to a lay audience the biological, physical, and chemical aspects of the arctic carbon cycle and the impacts of climate change on these features. Outreach methods will also include novel use of online tools to directly connect audiences with scientists in an effective and time-efficient manner.",

In recent decades air pollution has become not only one of the most important environmental problems of megacities, but also presents serious consequences to human health and ecosystems and economic costs to society. Although the progress to date in combating air pollution problems in developed and some developing world megacities has been impressive, many challenges remain including the need to improve air quality while simultaneously mitigating climate change.\nThis talk will present the results and the lessons learned from field measurements conducted in Mexico City Metropolitan Area – one of the world’s largest megacities – over the past decade. While each city has its own unique circumstances, the need for an integrated assessment approach in addressing complex environmental problems is the same. There is no single strategy in solving air pollution problems in megacities; a mix of policy measures based on sound scientific findings will be necessary to improve air quality, protect public health, and mitigate climate change.",

            "abstract": "In-situ pH is among the key factors affecting chemical reactions involved with fluid-rock interaction and metal transport in hydrothermal systems. A small variation in pH will often result in a large difference in dissolved metal concentrations. For instance, at 400oC, a decrease of ~0.15 pH unit will cause dissolved Fe concentration to double in fluid coexisting with a Fe-bearing mineral assemblage. This parameter also offers us an opportunity to better understand processes controlling the temporal evolution of hydrothermal vent fluid chemistry at mid-ocean ridges. During our recent cruise AT 26-17 with newly upgraded DSV2 Alvin, in-situ measurements of pH were carried out along with gas-tight sampling of vent fluids. Our efforts were focused at MEF and ASHES on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. These hydrothermal systems have been shown to be particularly responsive to subseafloor seismic and magmatic events. The measured fluid temperature was approximately 333˚C and 300˚C at Dante vent orifice of MEF and Inferno vent orifice of ASHES, respectively. The corresponding measured in-situ pH values for both vents are: 4.94 and 4.88, respectively. Dissolved gases and other species were also measured from gas-tight fluid samples providing a means of comparison with the in-situ data.\nAs we have known the earthquake and magmatic activity often places the system at higher temperature and more reducing conditions in connection with a new evolutionary cycle. Comparing these relatively low in-situ pH values with those measured in the past, especially with the ones obtained at MEF in 1999 after an intense swarm of earthquakes, we see the system trending towards more acidic conditions along with decreasing temperature and dissolved H2 and H2S. Taking an example from Dante vent site, in-situ pH value of 5.15 was recorded with a measured temperature of 363oC two month after the event in 1999, which gives 0.2 pH unit greater than the more recent data. Measured dissolved H2 and H2S concentrations in 1999 were also much higher. Altogether these results reveal an ongoing trend toward more oxidizing and acidic stage along with cooling.\nMore results will be discussed in this presentation with the emphasis on the factors that may have played the role in acidifying the system during the evolution cycle and its effect to metal mobility.",

High precision Sm-Nd garnet geochronology on several lithologies elucidated a metamorphic history involving slow initiation of garnet growth at 53.4 ± 2.6Ma, followed by a period of rapid growth between 46.95 ± 0.61Ma and 44.96 ± 0.53Ma. Individual samples exhibit entire porphyroblast growth durations spanning just hundreds of thousands of years. This chronology is coupled with phase equilibria modeling of several lithologies, constraining a minimum heating rate during garnet growth close to peak P. The pulse of growth described above coincides with a period of near isobaric heating, at a rate of >75°C/Myr, terminating at the peak P and T estimated for Sifnos (~2.2 GPa and 560°C; [1]). This heating rate initially seems high, so a comparison has been made with results from 2D thermal models that represent the global range of active subduction zones [2]. In each model, the P-T paths derived for the top of the slab experience a region of relatively isobaric heating, consistent with that determined for Sifnos. A common feature in each case is the existence of a sharp thermal gradient, separating a colder fore-arc from a warmer regime dominated by viscous flow of the mantle wedge. For appropriate convergence rates, this sharp thermal gradient is traversed at similar rates to that derived above for Sifnos. We infer that peak metamorphism (and the early stages of exhumation) on Sifnos may have occurred along this transition in thermal regime, with resultant pulsed metamorphism stemming from these elevated heating rates. We explore petrologic features such as the kinetics of garnet nucleation/growth under such rapid heating at high pressure.\n[1] Dragovic et al., 2012. Chem.

            "abstract": "A large number of people around the globe depend on groundwater as a source of fresh water. Groundwater dependence will be further intensified by the world’s exponentially increasing population and climate change. Therefore, quantification of groundwater storage (GWS) changes is a critical issue in the densely populated regions of the world. Approximately, 90% of groundwater withdrawals are associated with irrigational activities in the Indian subcontinent. We used a combination of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations, hydrological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) together with groundwater level measurements and ERA-Interim precipitation, for the period 2003-2012 to estimate regional GWS changes and to regionally evaluate the anthropogenic and climatic forcing control on the observed changes. Rapid GWS depletion (>10 mm/year) has been observed in the northern and eastern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Most of the groundwater depleted regions coincide with the highly fertile alluvial aquifers of Ganges-Brahmaputra basin, which is subjected to intense groundwater withdrawals associated with crop irrigation. Our GWS change estimates are consistent with ground-based water level measurements (n> 13,000) from the region. Over this ten year period, GWS data show little to moderate replenishments in southern and western regions of Indian subcontinent, probably because of advanced water resource management in these areas. Precipitation is the key factor controlling the renewability of groundwater resources, however, precipitation during the period was generally near normal to historical levels, suggesting strong anthropogenic influence on GWS change in the northern and eastern parts of India during the study period.",

            "abstract": "Scientists predict a number of climate changes for the US Midwest with expected declines in crop productivity as well as eco-hydrological impacts. More frequent extreme rain events particularly in the spring may well increase saturated soils thus complicating agronomic interests and also exacerbate watershed scale impairments (e.g., sediment, nutrient loss). In order to build more resilient production systems in light of climate change, farmers will increasingly need to implement conservation practices (singularly or more likely in combination) that enable farmers to manage profitable businesses yet mitigate consequential environmental impacts that have both in-field and off-farm implications. Cover crops are empirically known to promote many aspects of soil and water health yet even the most aggressive recent estimates show that only 1-2% of the total acreage in Iowa have been planted to cover crops.\nIn order to better understand why farmers are reluctant to adopt cover crops across Iowa we combined agronomic and financial data from long-term field trials, working farm trials and model simulations so as to present comprehensive data-driven information to farmers in focus group discussions in order to understand existing barriers, perceived benefits and responses to the information presented. Four focus groups (n=29) were conducted across Iowa in four geographic regions. Focus group discussions help explore the nuance of farmers’ responses to modeling outputs and their real-life agronomic realities, thus shedding light on the social and psychological barriers with cover crop utilization. Among the key insights gained, comprehensive data-driven research can influence farmer perspectives on potential cover crop impacts to cash crop yields, experienced costs are potentially quite variable, and having field/farm benefits articulated in economic terms are extremely important when farmers weigh the opportunity costs associated with adopting new practices. Our work represents multidisciplinary collaboration necessary to gain greater understanding of what it will take for farmers to cover the ground to prevent erosion and nutrient losses in the context of a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause is the dominant process allowing energy entry from the solar wind into the magnetosphere especially during southward IMF periods. Before reaching the magnetopause, the solar wind plasma transits through a bow shock, which decelerates the plasma and changes the magnetic field magnitude and orientation, and thus the local reconnection geometry. Differences of the shock physics in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular side cause asymmetries in the magnetosheath plasma that impacts the coupling processes at the magnetopause. Fluctuations in the magnetic field or plasma density and velocity can also contribute to the efficiency of the energy transfer processes both during southward and northward IMF conditions. We use the OMNI measurements in the solar wind and ionosphere together with the THEMIS observations in the magnetosheath to study the effects of the magnetosheath processes and IMF and velocity fluctuations on the energy and plasma input into the magnetosphere. MHD simulations both in global and local scales complement the observational analyses, which allow us to draw more quantitative conclusions and develop understanding of the underlying physics.",

            "abstract": "Injection of large volume of CO2 into deep geological reservoirs for geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is expected to cause significant pressure perturbations in subsurface. Large-scale pressure increases in injection reservoirs during GCS operations, if not controlled properly, may limit dynamic storage capacity and increase risk of environmental impacts. The high pressure may impact caprock integrity, induce fault slippage, and cause leakage of brine and/or CO2 into shallow fresh groundwater resources. Thus, monitoring and controlling pressure buildup are critically important for environmentally safe implementation of GCS projects. Extraction of native brine during GCS operations is a pressure management approach to reduce significant pressure buildup. Extracted brine can be transferred to the surface for utilization or re-injected into overlying/underlying saline aquifers. However, pumping, transportation, treatment and disposal of extracted brine can be challenging and costly. Therefore, minimizing volume of extracted brine, while maximizing CO2 storage, is an essential objective of the pressure management with brine extraction schemes. Selection of optimal well locations and extraction rates are critical for maximizing storage and minimizing brine extraction during GCS. However, placing of injection and extraction wells is not intuitive because of heterogeneity in reservoir properties and complex reservoir geometry. Efficient computerized algorithms combining reservoir models and optimization methods are needed to make proper decisions on well locations and control parameters. This study presents a global optimization methodology for pressure management during geologic CO2 sequestration. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) algorithm is introduced for solving optimization problems involving well placement and injection/extraction control. The CDE methodology is tested and applied for realistic CO2 storage scenarios with the presence of uncertainty in reservoir properties. Optimal placements of wells and selection of pumping rates are evaluated for different realizations of reservoir heterogeneity.",

Uniquely combining physical landscape models with predictive models of exploration activities, including drilling, pipeline construction and road reconstruction, the tools quantify the potential impacts of drilling activities for communities and landscapes in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nDividing the state into 9836 watershed sub-basins, we first describe the current state of Marcellus related activities through 2014. We then describe and report the results of three scaled predictive models designed to investigate probable sub-basins where future activities will be focused. Finally, the core of the paper reports on the second level of tools we have now developed to engage communities in planning for unconventional gas extraction in Pennsylvania. Using a geodesign approach we are working with communities to transfer information for comprehensive landscape planning and informed decision making.

            "abstract": "The Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in southern Bolivia has repeatedly sourced large-volume ignimbrite eruptions since 11 Ma. Though eruption rates have waned since 3 Ma, ­it is uncertain whether eruptions of a similar scale will occur in the future. Uturuncu volcano, a long-dormant dacite stratovolcano located within the APVC in southern Bolivia, currently exhibits sustained surface deformation over a broad, 70 km diameter area, with a peak uplift rate of ~1-2 cm/yr. This deformation corresponds to a magmatic source within the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB), a zone of partial melt within the mid-crust of the APVC that is thought to have sourced its large-volume ignimbrites. Given the short timescale of current geodetic measurements, however, it is unclear how this modern unrest relates to the evolution of Uturuncu’s underlying magmatic source. As geomorphic processes operate on timescales similar to those of magma chamber growth, we use the topography of lakes and rivers surrounding Uturuncu as strain markers to constrain its surface deformation history since the late Pleistocene. We investigate Uturuncu’s geomorphology through both field surveys and analysis of a high-resolution (0.5 m) digital elevation model (DEM). We focused our field efforts on two lakes proximal to Uturuncu: Laguna Mama Khumu and Laguna Loromayu. OSL data reveal shorelines of Tauca age (~15 ka), suggesting a regional basin response to climate. Differential GPS surveys of Mama Khumu’s shorelines show no evidence of deformation along the volcano’s flanks. Assuming a constant inflation rate, we estimate a maximum onset of Uturuncu’s present deformation phase at ~1 kyr before present. DEM-derived shoreline elevations match well with dGPS surveys, and DEM-derived river longitudinal profiles similarly show a lack of sustained surface deformation since the Tauca highstand. Together these observations imply a relatively stable topography at Uturuncu over the late Pleistocene, and thus the recent unrest here likely reflects a transient pulse of inflation rather than a snapshot of long-term tumescence. These results provide a valuable constraint for modelers seeking to link surface deformation to magmatic processes at depth, and more generally highlight the time-transient nature of large silicic magma chamber systems.",

            "abstract": "We present results of the first detailed microanalytical study of aerodynamic glassy fallout from Trinity, the world’s first nuclear device. The aerodynamic morphology of trinitite beads is consistent with their origination inside the nuclear cloud and solidification prior to reaching the ground. Existing conceptual models of aerodynamic fallout formation involve progressive condensation about a nucleus of ground material, followed by diffusive compositional homogenization. Microstructural and chemical composition data from eleven trinitite beads instead suggest that fallout records a multitude of physiochemical processes, including partial melting, agglomeration, volatile exsolution, condensation, melt mingling, and quenching. SEM-based mapping and EPMA data show that beads are composed of variable amounts of four distinct constituents ­– alkali-rich glass; silica glass (lechatlierite); Ca-Mg-Fe-bearing glass; and unmelted or partially melted mineral aggregates. Smooth, ovoid trinitite beads (2-5 mm diameter) comprise vesicular alkali and silica glass blebs with the compositions of fused feldspar and quartz grains, respectively, embedded within CaMgFe glass. Flattened or elongate beads (4-8 mm long axis) are mineral aggregates encased in a rind of predominantly CaMgFe glass. Increasing vesicularity toward the glass-aggregate interface suggests volatile exsolution as hotter melt contacted cooler mineral debris. CaMgFe glass is compositionally heterogeneous, with SiO2 contents ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic, and compositional banding indicating low-viscosity flow. Contacts between alkali, silica, and CaMgFe glasses are sharp to slightly diffuse, and EPMA traverses across glass contacts confirm limited diffusive exchange of major and minor elements. Autoradiography of trinitite shows that radioisotopes are confined to the CaMgFe glass, where they are patchily distributed, supporting limited diffusive mobility of trace elements as well. Overall, the microscale compositional heterogeneity of CaMgFe glass suggests that its precursor melt formed by condensation from the detonation-generated plasma (~8400 K) and quenched rapidly upon contact with cooler minerals and melts during turbulent mixing within the nuclear cloud.",

            "abstract": "The ribbon of enhanced energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux is the most prominent feature of outer heliospheric ENA emission as observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). Here, we study the systematic variation of ENA flux in the ribbon and in its vicinity as a function of angle from the ribbon center at ecliptic (219°, 40°) as projected in the sky. We find that the ENA emission on the interior of the ribbon (between the ribbon and the ribbon center) is correlated with the emission brightness of the ribbon peak, whereas ENA emission on the exterior of the ribbon (between the ribbon and the antipode of the ribbon center) is not correlated with ribbon brightness. The ribbon flux falls to zero beyond a great circle in the sky at 90º from the ribbon center and is thus constrained to a hemisphere of emission that is centered on the ribbon center. These results are consistent with the “secondary” emission process of ribbon formation in the outer heliosheath [Heerikhuisen et al., 2010; McComas and Schwadron, 2013]. We additionally deconvolve the IBEX point spread function from analytical fits to the ribbon shape. We find that the ribbon peak is approximately 5% brighter than observations that do not consider the PSF. We also find a wide but consistent variation of ribbon widths, with the full width at half maximum ranging from 14º and 34º for 0.7-2.7 keV. At 4.3 keV the ribbon is consistently wider, with a 24º minimum ribbon width. We discuss the implications of the sharpness of the ribbon peak for observations of the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP).",

            "abstract": "Brownfields or urban sites that have been contaminated as a result of historic practices are present throughout the world. In the United States alone, the National Research Council has estimated that there are approximately 300,000 to 400,000 sites which have been contaminated by improper use and disposal of chemicals (NRC 1993). The land available at these sites is estimated at several million acres; however, the presence of high levels of contamination in the soil and groundwater makes it difficult to utilize these sites for traditional purposes such as agriculture. Further, the time required to remediate these contaminants to regulated levels is in the order of decades, which often results in long-term economic consequences for the areas near these sites. There has been significant interest in developing these sites as potential sources of renewable energy production in order to increase the economic viability of these sites and to provide alternative land resources for renewable energy production (EPA 2012). Solar energy, wind energy, and bioenergy from lignocellulosic biomass production have been identified as the main sources of renewable energy that can be produced at these locations. However, the environmental impacts of such a policy and the implications for greenhouse gas emissions, particularly resulting from changes in land-use impacting the biogeochemical cycle at these sites, have not been studied extensively to date.\nThis study uses the biogeochemical process-based model DNDC to simulate carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions and methane emissions from typical urban brownfield systems in the United States, when renewable energy systems are deployed. Photovoltaic solar energy and lignocellulosic biomass energy systems are evaluated here. Plants modeled include those most widely used for both bioenergy and remediation such as woody trees. Model sensitivity to soil conditions, contaminant levels and local weather data and the resulting impacts on greenhouse gas emissions are explored. Tradeoffs between renewable energy production,contaminant removal, and mitigation of greenhouse gases are also evaluated. Results indicate that a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions of 29-43% is possible, together with an estimated increase in renewable energy production of 7-22%.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convection can be regarded as the superposition of two convective models: a\nplate mode and a plume mode. Geodynamic modeling of these regimes has granted\ninsight into surface features, and tells us about the mantle processes in a system largely\ndevoid of observables. Our study of the 35°–40°E segment of the Southwest Indian Ridge\n(SWIR) seeks to link geochemical and geological observations with the underlying mantle\nprocesses.\nBoth plate and plume modes interact and combine at the SWIR 35°–40°E segment. The\nmid-ocean ridge itself is a manifestation of the plate tectonics mode of mantle convection.\nThe slow opening rate and obliquity of this segment should lead to low volcanic activity\nalong this segment. However, this segment is the point along the SWIR closest to the\nMarion hotspot, a manifestation of the plume mode of mantle convection. When interacting\nwith the mid-ocean ridges, hotspots like the Azores, Iceland, Galápagos, and Rodriguez\nproduce distinctive patterns, such as propagating rifts, triple junctions, and enriched MORB\nsignatures. The Marion hotspot does not have a similar effect on the SWIR even though\nit is associated with a bathymetric high and residual mantle Bouguer anomaly low. A\nnotable feature along the ridge is a V-shaped bathymetric anomaly around one of the non-\ntransform discontinuities (NTD).\nAs for the SWIR 10°-16°E area (Montési et al., 2011) geodynamics modeling predicts\nmagma focusing to highly segmented non-transform oblique segments (NTOS) along the\nridge. However, geophysical observations show a thinning crust at these regions. Modeling\nwithout the segmentation along the oblique segments shows much better agreement with\nthe observations. So either the NTOS are a crustal structure that does not influence mantle\nupwelling, melt extraction parameters vary along the ridge, or the density of the crust is\nanomalous in NTOS due to a different fractionation history.\nWe will incorporate whole rock chemistry (including trace element, & REEs) constraints\nto the evaluation of our hypotheses by modeling melt evolution and crystallization under\ndifferent conditions and comparing model predictions with collected samples.",

            "abstract": "Chaos is ubiquitous in physical systems. Within the Earth sciences it is readily evident in seismology, groundwater flows and drilling data. Models and workflows have been applied successfully to understand and even to predict chaotic systems in other scientific fields, including electrical engineering, neurology and oceanography. Unfortunately, the high levels of noise characteristic of our planet’s chaotic processes often render these frameworks ineffective. This contribution presents techniques for the reduction of noise associated with measurements of nonlinear systems.\nOur ultimate aim is to develop data assimilation techniques for forward models that describe chaotic observations, such as episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events in fault zones. A series of nonlinear filters are presented and evaluated using classical chaotic systems. To investigate whether the filters can successfully mitigate the effect of noise typical of Earth science, they are applied to sunspot data. The filtered data can be used successfully to forecast sunspot evolution for up to eight years (see figure).",

While industrial users have disclosed several hundreds of compound and mixture identities, it is unclear which of these are used and where, in what proportion, and with what frequency. Furthermore, while flowback and production waters contain both fracturing additive and geogenic compounds, they may contain potential reaction byproducts as well. Here, we identified several hundred organic compounds present in six hydraulic fracturing flowback waters over the Fayetteville shale. Identifications were made via non-target analysis using two-dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry for hydrophobic organic compounds and liquid chromatography- orbitrap mass spectrometry. Compound identities were confirmed using purchased standards when available. Using the SkyTruth database and the Waxman list of disclosed compounds, we assigned compounds as either fracturing-fluid-derived or geogenic (or both), or a putative transformation products thereof. Several unreported halogenated compounds were detected, including chlorinated, brominated, and iodated species that have no known natural sources. Control studies indicated that these could not be formed under typical laboratory or field storage conditions, suggesting that halogenation reactions may give rise to novel compounds in the subsurface, presumably via reaction between fracturing fluid additives and shale-derived brines. Further, the six samples were strikingly heterogeneous, reflecting the diversity in fracturing fluid composition and flowback handling procedures at the time of the study.",

            "abstract": "Professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields do not reflect the diversity of the US population. Among the most effective ways to attract and retain underrepresented students in STEM disciplines is to provide opportunities for participation in the scientific process and interaction with practicing scientists.\nProject HEAT (Hot Environments, Animals, & Temperature) is “boot-camp”-style workshop aimed at increasing interest in STEM topics among underrepresented, first-generation, college-bound middle school students. Linking to our NASA-funded research project “Desert Birds in a Warming World”, we focused on how surprisingly variable temperature is in space and time, why temperature is important to plants, animals, and people, and how we measure temperature in the field and from space. Perhaps more importantly, this theme was a vehicle for students to experience science as a process: field observations, brainstorming questions and hypotheses, designing experiments to test them, and analyzing and reporting their data. The centerpiece was a set of experiments with small temperature sensors and radiation shields that teams of students designed, executed at a local park, analyzed, and reported.\nTwo years of pre and post assessments revealed that Project HEAT participants increased understanding in content areas and showed slight increases in STEM interest. Year two results were markedly stronger than year one in both assessments as well as our perception. We attribute this to earlier summer timing of the workshop, a change from two half-day weeks to one full-day week, and a more age-homogeneous selection of students. In comments, participants expressed their special enjoyment of the hands-on nature of the program and the outdoor learning. Though providing such opportunities can be challenging, our experience here suggests that it can be worth while. Project HEAT also benefited our cadre of graduate student mentors by providing exposure to K-12 learning. Although successful on the whole, the limited improvement in STEM interest suggests a fundamental challenge of making an impact during a short period of time.",

            "abstract": "Models of the glacial isostatic adjustment process, which are designed to explain the influence of the Late Pleistocene cycle of glaciation and deglaciation on planetary shape and sea level, require two fundamental inputs. These consist of a model of mantle viscosity as well as a global history of ice sheet loading and unloading. Various geophysical and geological observables enable the testing and refinement of these global models: among these, geological inferences of sea level history based upon appropriate relative sea level indicators and modern space geodetic observations of uplift of the surface of the solid Earth obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments have proven to be particularly important.\nHigh-quality relative sea level history reconstructions have been central not only to the development of existing spherically symmetric models of the internal visco-elastic structure of the mantle, but also to the development of current global ice sheet histories for the Late Quaternary, such as the most recently constructed ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model of Peltier et al. (JGR-Solid Earth, in press). In particular, observations of relative sea level evolution along the East coast of the United States (such as provided by the high-quality database of Engelhart et al. (2011, Geology)) are of special interest, given their location along a transect of the forebulge associated with the former Laurentide ice sheet.\nIn this paper, we examine how the misfits identified in the literature for the southern part of the U.S. East coast can be eliminated by appropriate changes in mantle viscosity structure represented by VM5a and ice sheet loading history variations represented by ICE-6G_C, focusing mainly on the sensitivity of sea level history predictions for sites along the eastern seaboard to depth-dependent mantle viscosity variations. The impact of ice sheet loading history variations upon these misfits is also discussed, and proves to be especially important in the context of maintaining an appropriate fit to the GPS observations of present-day vertical uplift over North America. In this regard, data from the US West coast proves to be especially useful as a means of confirming the validity of the adjustments to the model determined on the basis of the East coast data set.",

To produce management-relevant science, managers and scientists must communicate clearly to identify research that is scientifically doable and will produce results that managers find useful. Scientists might also consider that journals with high impact scores are rarely used by managers, while managers might consider that publishing in top tier journals is important to maintain scientific credentials. We offer examples from climate change and river restoration research, in which agency scientists and managers worked together to identify key management questions that scientists could answer and which could inform management. In our first example, we describe how climate scientists worked with agency staff to develop guidance for selecting appropriate climate change scenarios for use in ecological impacts assessments and Endangered Species Act decision making. Within NOAA Fisheries, agency researchers provide science to guide agency managers, and a key question has been how to adapt river restoration efforts for climate change. Based on discussions with restoration practitioners and agency staff, we developed adaptation guidance that summarizes current science to lead managers to develop climate-resilient restoration plans, as well as maps of population vulnerability for endangered steelhead. From these experiences we have learned that collaborative definition of relevant and producible knowledge requires (1) iterative discussions that go beyond simply asking managers what they need or scientists what they can produce, and (2) candid conversation about the intended applications and potential limitations of the knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Increasing recognition of transitional flow deposits in submarine fans has shown that the evolution of flow rheology in sediment-gravity currents can have a significant impact on the heterogeneity of deepwater sediment accumulations. Sea-cliff exposure of the Cretaceous Point Loma Formation in San Diego, California, provides a unique opportunity to document the internal variability and spatial distribution of thin, fine-grained event beds. Upper portions of beds which commonly appear as featureless mud in exposures of typical quality are revealed as thin, clast-rich debrites in areas where sea cliffs are polished by waves. The ubiquity of these deposits in distal lobe strata suggests complex rheological evolution for nearly all currents that were able to run out to lobe margins. Here we supplement qualitative outcrop characterization with statistical analysis to quantify relationships between deposit thickness, grain size, and the spatial distribution of sedimentary facies. Intervals dominated by transitional flow deposits are shown to occur vertically near the base of coarsening-upward successions and laterally toward lobe margins, reflecting a combination of dynamic processes during individual events and the spatial distribution of consecutive deposits. We show that the ability to distinguish patterns of bed-scale variability reflecting flow evolution from patterns associated with larger-scale processes, such as distributary channel avulsion and compensational stacking, is critical if one is to accurately model heterogeneity within submarine fan systems. Furthermore, the observation that thin, fine-grained debrites can be nearly impossible to distinguish from featureless mud intervals unless exceptionally well-exposed may cast doubt on existing interpretations where outcrop quality is less than remarkable.",

            "abstract": "With the rate of Arctic sea ice decline increasing over the past decade, and ice-free conditions in the central Arctic predicted for the second half of this century, it is increasingly important to put sea-ice decline in the context of natural variability. Unfortunately, satellite observations of sea ice only extend back to 1979, and direct observations before then are spotty at best. Recently, there have been several advances in sea ice proxies. Specifically improvements in diatom-based proxies and the molecular biomarker, IP25, have allowed quantitative reconstructions of Arctic sea ice.\nHere we apply our own IP25 and diatom assemblage sea ice calibrations for the Bering and Chukchi seas to two cores in the Bering Sea that extend to the Last Glacial Maximum in order to explore differences in the proxy records. In addition, we present high-resolution grain size analyses as a way to test the presence or absence of sea ice.\nBefore 14.5 ka, the sediments are composed of up to 20% clay by volume, reflecting transport by sea ice or from a proximal coastline during this time of lowered sea level. IP25 indicates extensive sea ice and the diatom assemblages are dominated by Thalassiosira antarctica and pennate benthic diatoms. Today, T. antarctica is associated with heavy winter and spring sea ice and forms resting spores during an abrupt advance of sea ice in the fall. The pennate benthic taxa include rare instances of IP25-producing species as well as other Naviculoid species that are commonly found attached to spring sea ice.\nBetween 14.5 and 12 ka, clay sized particles make up only 8% of the sediments and IP25 indicates that sea ice was absent from both locations. However, diatoms commonly found in the marginal ice zone today such as Fragilariopsis spp. Thalassiosira hyalina, and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii are common.\nSea ice was extensive (up to 60% annual coverage) at both sites during the Last Glacial Maximum and it declined during the deglaciation. IP25 indicates that sea ice was absent at both sites after 14.5 ka, except for a minor advance during the Younger Dryas. However, in contrast, diatom assemblages indicate that sea ice was present until 11 ka. We hypothesize that two different ice conditions existed, with the more recent ice unsuitable for IP25-producers.",

            "abstract": "Steep rocky hillslopes dominate the areal extent of rapidly uplifting mountain ranges, and pose a significant hazard to encroaching population centers. Existing models for hillslope sediment transport developed for soil-mantled landscapes are poorly suited to explain the evolution of steep hillslopes characterized by: (1) intermittent or patchy soil cover, (2) slopes that exceed the angle of repose, and (3) transport events that often involve long travel distances. Recently, nonlocal formulations of hillslope sediment transport laws that account for long travel distances have been proposed to overcome the limitations of traditional continuum-based models. However, their application to natural landscapes has been limited owing to few field constraints on key parameters, and computational difficulties expanding the framework to two-dimensions. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a series of field experiments on natural hillslopes to inform a simple particle-based model of hillslope sediment transport. We compiled the distribution of average velocity and transport distance for over 300 stones ranging in diameter from 2-10 cm using a video camera and laser range-finder. To characterize surface roughness, we used a tripod-based laser scanner to generate a 1 cm-resolution digital elevation model of each 30 m long hillslope. We find that hillslope travel distance follows a heavy-tailed distribution that varies systematically with the ratio of particle diameter to roughness height, in general agreement to published laboratory experiments. Mean particle velocity ranges from 1-3 m/s and scales weakly with distance traveled. Our modeling exercise reveals three key effects that should be included in any treatment of steep hillslope evolution: (1) there is a strong grain-size and surface roughness dependence on sediment transport distance, (2) sediment storage on slopes steeper than the angle of repose is possible due to vegetation or topographic roughness, and (3) sediment flux from steep rocky hillslopes depends on both slope and the temporal evolution of surface roughness, e.g., due to landslides or wildfire.",

            "abstract": "Spanning over Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is the home of several hundred million people and the “bread basket” for much of South Asia. The flat terrain, fertile soils, and favorable climate of the IGP make it agriculturally productive. However prolonged droughts caused by consecutive monsoon failures can seriously affect crop production and social wellbeing, in particular for the eastern part of the plains where agriculture remains largely rain-fed. Severe droughts were observed in the IGP historically, and recent paleoclimate studies reveal that more severe and long-lasting “mega-droughts” had happened in the distant past. Agricultural losses from major droughts can dramatically affect food systems and increase the vulnerability of resource-poor people given the delicate balance between food supply and demand under growing natural resource scarcity. To estimate the potential impacts of “mega-droughts” on the water and food systems in the IGP, we develop worst-case drought scenarios through inverse modeling of tree-ring-based PDSI reconstruction that covers the period 1300-1899 (A.D.), and analyze these historic mega-drought scenarios using IFPRI’s IMPACT global water and food projections model. The base year of the IMPACT model is parameterized using socioeconomic and engineering data that reflect today’s water management and infrastructure, agricultural technologies, population, income, and market institutions. The base year simulation is validated against observations to ensure model fidelity. Anticipated changes of the above factors in the future out to 2050 are specified using demographic and economic growth projections and literature data. Model simulation results represent the consequences of mega-droughts in the IGP given technological and socioeconomic conditions of today and in the future. We also explore policy options for increasing the resilience of water and food systems in the IGP, through scenario analysis, and recommendations are made concerning investment in water infrastructure and agricultural technologies, in addition to trade policies.",

            "abstract": "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) modeling is an emerging field in hydrology. Investigation of groundwater change using remote sensing data helps overcome data limitation at a global and regional scale. However, its application to regional or local scale hydrogeologic settings has been limited, especially for the use of the publically available Level 3 data. We conducted a study to estimate the change of groundwater using remotely sensed GRACE and ground truth data for the Upper Mississippi Basin in the US. The modeling conditions that affect the model accuracy are soil moisture models, groundwater fluctuations in the monitoring wells, and the hydrogeologic conditions of the aquifer. We adopted three different land surface models for soil moisture: CLM (Common Land Model), Noah, and Mosaic. The ground truth data from monitoring wells were obtained from the USGS National Water Information System. The results showed that the best-fit soil moisture model is CLM. The correlation coefficient is 86.1%, which signifies strong correlation between remote sensed and ground truth data. As for the effect of aquifer, the best selection of well observations is when the groundwater data is collected from the sand and gravel aquifer. Correlation with well observations in sand and gravel aquifers were 73.4%. The best-fit condition is therefore when the CLM was adopted for soil moisture in the GRACE calculation as well as 11 well observations from the sand and gravel aquifer used for the ground-truth calculation. Under the best-fit conditions, the correlation coefficient between the GRACE and the ground truth is 91.8%.",

            "abstract": "What determines the depth extent of slip in large earthquakes? Faults feature depth-dependent frictional, hydraulic, and structural properties. Observationally, faults are separated into seismogenic layers (SL) and deeper creeping extensions based on either microseismicity or inferred locking depth. Slip in large earthquakes is often assumed to be limited to the SL. Physically, this separation can be explained by transition, at slow slip rates, from rate-weakening (RW) to rate-strengthening (RS) behavior. However, as revealed in experimental and theoretical studies, enhanced weakening during rapid earthquake slip – e.g., due to thermal pressurization (TP) of pore fluids - may be critical to rupture propagation. The extent of such weakening need not coincide with the traditionally defined SL.\nUsing 3D rate-and-state fault models with temperature and pore pressure evolution, we study the effect of depth-dependent permeability and shear-zone width on long-term fault slip. Competition between the two properties determines the depth dependence of co-seismic weakening due to TP, since permeability decreases with depth (due to higher compression), promoting TP, while the shear-zone width likely increases below certain depth (due to increasingly inelastic bulk properties), lowering the co-seismic temperature increase and suppressing TP.\nWe find that, indeed, large ruptures can penetrate below the traditionally defined SL, into the “stable” fault regions, due to TP. When they do, microseismicity patterns at the bottom of the SL change, potentially allowing for identification of such penetration in recent events. The behavior of large ruptures, including their depth extent, varies along strike, even though the fault properties are uniform along strike. This is because co-seismic weakening is strongly dependent on the local rupture properties (slip rate and slip), setting up a strong feedback loop between the weakening and rupture response. The non-uniform slip during one event leads to spatio-temporal complexity in subsequent events, including large variations of depth extent with time. Our current efforts are directed towards quantifying these effects, including the relation between rupture slip, depth, and length as well as their variability.",

            "abstract": "Integrating field and model observations of marine carbonate strata, we investigate how distinct sedimentary basins respond to the same eustatic sea level history, specifically in terms of the preserved record of lithofacies and meter-scale depositional cycles. First, we compare two coeval Devonian sedimentary records characterized by different subsidence regimes (North American ‘stable’ cratonic interior vs. ‘passive’ continental margin) and rock accumulation rates (measured over m.y. time scales). Despite the greater potential for subaerial exposure due to minimal accommodation space, stratigraphic and petrographic analyses revealed the apparently significant role of suppressed subtidal sedimentation rates, along with submarine erosion and non-deposition, in limiting both the thickness and number of facies and cycles preserved in the cratonic record compared to the continental margin.\nTo explore insights gained from the field, we use a previously-developed, one-dimensional forward model to generate stratigraphic columns. Knowing the true history underlying each model run, we can test the sensitivity of the resultant stratigraphy to variation in subsidence and sedimentation rates, while maintaining the same eustatic sea level curve. For the model conditions explored, 1) thicker component depositional units reflect higher sedimentation rates; 2) total stratigraphic thickness, numbers of units, and stratigraphic completeness reflect combinations of low enough sedimentation rates and high enough subsidence rates to maintain sufficient accommodation space; and 3) the preserved stratal patterns rarely faithfully record sea level history. The model results lead to new questions that can direct future field studies. Overall, this approach can inform similar investigations in other carbonate, siliciclastic and non-marine records, especially over stratigraphic scales finer than the temporal resolution typically afforded by numerical ages and correlation techniques.",

The objective of the fourth bore was to reduce traffic congestion before the tunnel entrance in the off-peak direction of travel, but the project was a source of conflict between policy makers and environmental and community groups concerned about the air quality and traffic impacts.\nWe analyze the impact of the opening of the fourth bore on CO2 emissions associated with traffic. We made surface observations of CO2from a mobile platform along State Route 24 for several weeks in November 2013 incorporating the period prior to and after the opening of the fourth bore on November 16, 2013. We directly compare bottom-up and top-down approaches to estimate the change in traffic emissions associated with the fourth bore opening. A bottom-up emissions inventory was derived from the high-resolution Performance Measurement System (PeMs) dataset and the Multi-scale Motor Vehicle and Equipment Emissions System (MOVES). The emissions inventory was used to drive a box model as well as a high-resolution regional transport model (the Weather and Regional Forecasting Model). The box model was also used to derive emissions from observations in a basic inversion.\nWe also present an analysis of long-term traffic patterns and consider the potential for compensating changes in behavior that offset the observed emissions reductions on longer timescales. Finally, we examine how the results from the Caldecott study demonstrate the general benefit of using mobile measurements for quantifying environmental impacts of congestion mitigation projects.",

            "abstract": "Effective climate resiliency planning at the regional level requires extensive interactive dialogue among climate scientists, emergency managers, public health officials, urban planners, social scientists, and policy makers. Engaging federal, tribal, state, local governments and private sector business and infrastructure owners/operators in defining, assessing and characterizing the impacts of extreme events allows communities to understand how different events “break the system” forcing local communities to seek support and resources from state/federal governments and/or the private sector and what actions can be taken proactively to mitigate consequences and accelerate recovery. The Washoe County Regional Resiliency Study was prepared in response to potential climate variability related impacts specific to the Northern Nevada Region. The last several decades have seen dramatic growth in the region, coupled with increased resource demands that have forced local governments to consider how those impacts will affect the region and may, in turn, impact the region’s ability to provide essential services. The Western Regional Climate Center of the Desert Research Institute provided a synthesis of climate studies with predictions regarding plausible changes in the local climate of Northern California and Nevada for the next 50 years. In general, these predictions indicate that the region’s climate is undergoing a gradual shift, which will primarily affect the frequency, amount, and form of precipitation in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin. Changes in water availability and other extreme events may have serious and long lasting effects in the Northern Nevada Region, and create a variety of social, environmental and economic concerns. A range of extreme events were considered including Adverse Air Quality, Droughts, Floods, Heat Waves, High Wind, Structure Fires, Wildland Fires, and Major Winter Storms. Due to the complexity of our climate systems, and the difficulty in specifying how severe the climate effects may be or how those impacts compound existing hazards in the system, the Resiliency Study focused on identifying a variety of ‘no regrets’ policy options that can help the local communities anticipate, respond and recover faster and more efficiently to climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the importance of microbial contributions to our natural gas supply has been widely recognized, even leading to efforts to enhance the rate of methanogenesis in reservoirs whether the substrate is oil, coal or the organic matter in shale. The identification of biogenic gas was first established with gas compositional and isotopic data. More recently, molecular genomic data has been applied, giving us a glimpse into bacterial and archaeal communities in the subsurface, both in reservoirs where the microbial community was expected by the geochemical signature, but also in flowback waters from formations where there was no indication of anything other than thermogenic gas. With these microbes, it is not so much a question of “build it and they will come”, but more that the community lies in wait for conditions to improve and allow them to flourish.\nConditions for microbial methanogenesis are well constrained: temperatures up to ~80oC, low sulfate concentration, and chloride concentrations under 2M. However, these are rather expansive boundaries and within each range there lies constant turnover in population density as well specific microbial abundances. In addition, the rates at which these microbes are able convert complex organic matter into methane depend upon environmental conditions. Confounding our evaluation of these subsurface communities is the effect that production incurs. Over the past two decades, wells under production in the Antrim Shale have exhibited changes in the geochemistry of formation fluids, most notably a drop in dissolved inorganic carbon of ~10mM. Gas chemistry has also shifted, with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that have also become more enriched in 13C, while the co-produced methane has become more depleted in 13C over the 20 years that these few wells have been monitored. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, the microbial community has also shifted with the water’s chemical evolution. Most intriguing is the correlation of the deuterium in the water to the methane, where CO2-reduction seems to remain the dominant methanogenic pathway and the gas composition is responding to changes in the water source. This may signify a relatively high proportion of recently produced methane in the system.",

Mine tailing piles, mounds of crushed mineral ore, often contain significant quantities of heavy metal elements which may leach into surrounding soils, surface water and ground water. Chemical analysis of contaminated soils is a tedious and time-consuming process. Regional assessment of heavy metal contamination for treatment prioritization would be greatly accelerated by the development of near-surface imaging indices of heavy-metal vegetative stress in western grasslands. Further, the method would assist in measuring the ongoing effectiveness of phytoremedatian and phytostabilization efforts. To test feasibility we ground truthed nine phytoremediated and two control sites sites along the mine-impacted Kerber Creek watershed in Saguache County, Colorado. Total metal concentration was determined by XRF for both plant and soil samples. Leachable metals were extracted from soil samples following US EPA method 1312. Plants were identified, sorted into roots, shoots and leaves, and digested via microwave acid extraction. Metal concentrations were determined with high accuracy by ICP-OES analysis. Plants were found to contain significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals than surrounding soils, particularly for manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), barium (Ba), and lead (Pb). Plant species accumulated and distributed metals differently, yet most showed translocation of metals from roots to above ground structures. Ground analysis was followed by near surface imaging using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with visible/near and shortwave infrared (0.7 to 1.5 µm) cameras. Images were assessed for spectral shifts indicative of plant stress and attempts made to correlate results with measured soil and plant metal concentrations.",

            "abstract": "A large fraction of atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) are organic aerosols (OA) that can form from primary emission (primary OA) or oxidation of more volatile organic compounds (secondary OA). Most OA are semi-volatile that can evaporate from particle phase to gas phase. OA evaporation strongly impacts aerosol mass loading, aerosol oxidation state, and aerosol properties in the atmosphere. In this study, we use four semi-volatile long-chain n-alkanes (n-octadecane, n-eicosane, n-docosane, and n-tetracosane) and α-pinene-derived OA as surrogates for primary and secondary OA, respectively. The evaporation of these OA components was examined in a flow reactor. Two soft ionization mass spectrometry techniques were used to measure evaporation kinetics of individual OA constituents: on-line direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry (DART-MS) (used for secondary OA) and off-line two-dimensional gas chromatograph coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC×GC/HTOF-MS) with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (used for primary OA). The semi-volatile n-alkanes can be oxidized in both phases, following different reaction schemes and leading to multigenerational oxygenated products with different isomeric distributions. Here the evaporation kinetic of primary OA surrogates was determined based on chemical analysis and kinetic simulations. The evaporation of α-pinene-derived OA was characterized based on the DART-MS mass spectra change upon heating. Results for both systems suggest slow evaporation compared to the gas-particle partitioning theory, especially when the OA are solid. The species-wise measurements using novel techniques provide insights into the detailed evaporation kinetics for atmospheric relevant systems.",

            "abstract": "Data-intensive or data-centric science is 4th paradigm after observational and/or experimental science (1st paradigm), theoretical science (2nd paradigm) and numerical science (3rd paradigm). Science cloud is an infrastructure for 4th science methodology. The NICT science cloud is designed for big data sciences of Earth, space and other sciences based on modern informatics and information technologies [1]. Data flow on the cloud is through the following three techniques; (1) data crawling and transfer, (2) data preservation and stewardship, and (3) data processing and visualization. Original tools and applications of these techniques have been designed and implemented. We mash up these tools and applications on the NICT Science Cloud to build up customized systems for each project.\nIn this paper, we discuss science data processing through these three steps. For big data science, data file deployment on a distributed storage system should be well designed in order to save storage cost and transfer time. We developed a high-bandwidth virtual remote storage system (HbVRS) and data crawling tool, NICTY/DLA and Wide-area Observation Network Monitoring (WONM) system, respectively. Data files are saved on the cloud storage system according to both data preservation policy and data processing plan. The storage system is developed via distributed file system middle-ware (Gfarm: GRID datafarm). It is effective since disaster recovery (DR) and parallel data processing are carried out simultaneously without moving these big data from storage to storage. Data files are managed on our Web application, WSDBank (World Science Data Bank). The big-data on the cloud are processed via Pwrake, which is a workflow tool with high-bandwidth of I/O. There are several visualization tools on the cloud; VirtualAurora for magnetosphere and ionosphere, VDVGE for google Earth, STICKER for urban environment data and STARStouch for multi-disciplinary data. There are 30 projects running on the NICT Science Cloud for Earth and space science.\nIn 2003 56 refereed papers were published. At the end, we introduce a couple of successful results of Earth and space sciences using these three techniques carried out on the NICT Sciences Cloud.\n[1] http://sc-web.nict.go.jp",

            "abstract": "Savannas cover 60% of the African continent and play an essential role in the global carbon (C) cycle. To better characterize the physical controls over soil respiration in these settings, half-hourly observations of volumetric soil-water content, temperature, and the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) at different soil depths were continually measured from 2005 to 2007 under trees (“sub-canopy”) and between trees (“inter-canopy”) in a savanna vegetation near Skukuza, Kruger National Park, South Africa. The measured soil climate and CO2 concentration data were assimilated into a process-based model that estimates the CO2 production and flux with coupled dynamics of dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C. Our results show that temporal and spatial variations in CO2 flux were strongly influenced by precipitation and vegetation cover, with two times greater CO2 flux in the sub-canopy plots (~2421 g CO2 m-2 yr-1) than in the inter-canopy plots (~1290 g CO2 m-2 yr-1). Precipitation influenced soil respiration by changing soil temperature and moisture; however, our modeling analysis suggests that the pulsed response of soil respiration to precipitation [known as “Birch effect (BE)”] is a key control on soil fluxes at this site. At this site, BE contributed to approximately 50% and 65% of heterotrophic respiration or 20% and 39% of soil respiration in the sub-canopy and inter-canopy plots, respectively. These results suggest that pulsed response of respiration to precipitation is an important component of the C cycle of savannas and should be considered in both measurement and modeling studies of carbon exchange in similar ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Integrated analysis of ground-based vegetation data and remote sensing supports vegetation mapping, landscape-change detection, wildlife habitat assessment, and tracking of phenological events such as green-up and senescence. The life-cycles of tundra plants occur within a highly compressed seasonal window, making the quantitative assessment of vegetation and landscape attributes from ≤30m resolution remotely-sensed imagery, such as above-ground biomass, % shrub cover, and % surface water, a difficult task when applied across large study domains. To support mapping of vegetation and landscape attributes across ~100,000 km2 of Alaska’s North Slope, we obtained ground data for tundra vegetation using a point-intercept sampling approach across a network of 107 field plots spanning gradients of bioclimate, landscape position (upland, lowland, riverine), and geomorphic setting (foothills, coastal plain). At each plot, vegetation data were collected along three 50-m linear transects, compatible with 30-m Landsat imagery. We summarized live vegetation, litter, and non-vegetated surfaces using three terms: top cover (uppermost “hit”), percent cover (total areal cover along transect), and hit density (all “hits” at a point). We then evaluated a suite of data models (e.g., General Additive Models, classification tree, clustering) and data-mining approaches (e.g., neural networks, random forest) using midsummer Landsat TM/ETM+ acquisitions since 1985, and OLI acquisitions for 2013–2014. The large size, frequent cloudiness, and interannual variability of the study area necessitated the compositing of a multitude of Landsat scenes. A median NDVI compositing technique was used to select Landsat observations from cloud- and shadow-free pixels that met day-of-year and year constraints. This technique produced seamless, phenologically consistent composites that are largely free of artifacts and suitable for regional-scale analysis. Ground-based training data and an archive of very-high-resolution (< 2-m pixel) commercial imagery provide means to evaluate statistical and data-mining approaches.",

            "abstract": "Surface water is a vital resource affected by changes in climate and anthropogenic factors. Knowledge of surface water dynamics provides critical information for flood and drought management. Here we focused on the on the entire Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia, a large semi-arid region with scarce water resources, high hydroclimatic variability and competing water demands, impacted by climate change, altered flow regimes and land use changes. The MDB is also an area where substantial investment in environmental water allocation of large volumes of environmental flow was made. We used Landsat TM and ETM+ time series to synoptically map the dynamic of surface water extent with an internally consistent algorithm (Tulbure and Broich, 2013) over decades (1986-2011). We used a subset of Landsat path/rows for image training in both wet and dry years. Results show high interannual variability in number and size of flooded areas, with flooded areas during the Millennium Drought (until 2009) being substantially smaller than during the excessive 2010-2011 La Nina flooding. Flooding frequency in 2006, a very dry year was lower than in 2010, the La Nina year when extensive floods occurred. More developed areas of the basin showed different inter-annual patterns from natural areas of the basin. At Barmah-Millewa, the largest river red gum forest in the world, we also mapped flooded forest and tracked changes in NDVI. Higher NDVI values were found in areas more frequently flooded. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of flooding and the response of riparian vegetation communities to flooding is important for management of floodplain wetlands and vegetation communities and for investigating effectiveness of environmental flows and flow regimes in the MDB. Existing maps of inundated areas are linked with river flow to quantify the relationship between river flow and inundated area in the MDB. Historic flood inundation extent mapped via remote sensing can be used to quantify spatially explicit changes in surface water dynamics and vegetation communities as outcomes of management scenarios in response to water management decisions. This methodology is globally applicable and relevant to areas prone to flooding with competing water demands and can be used for mapping water availability in data scarce regions.",

            "abstract": "Soil dust aerosols in Earth system models are typically assumed to have globally uniform properties. However, important climate processes related to dust depend on the aerosol mineral and chemical composition, which varies regionally. Such processes include aerosol radiative forcing, transport of bioavailable iron that catalyzes marine photosynthesis, heterogeneous chemistry, ice nucleation, and cloud condensation.\nWe have implemented a new version of the soil dust aerosol scheme in the NASA GISS Earth System ModelE that takes into account the mineral composition of the dust particles. Dust aerosols are represented as an external mixture of minerals such as illite, kaolinite, smectite, carbonates, quartz, feldspar and gypsum, as well as iron oxides and accretions of iron oxides with each of the these minerals.\nWe present a new publically available compilation of measurements of mineral fractions derived from ca. 50 references from the literature. This compilation is used to evaluate our new model of mineral and elemental composition within ModelE. We discuss the challenges of comparing simulated mineral fractions to measurements, which often come from field campaigns and ship cruises of limited duration. Despite uncertainties of the measurements, we show the importance of estimating the undisturbed size distribution of the parent soil prior to wet sieving, along with the modification of this size distribution during emission. \nIn particular, our new model reproduces measurements showing greater amount of aerosols at silt sizes (whose diameters exceed 2 μm) including significant amounts of clay mineral aerosols (like illite) at silt sizes. Our model also reduces the systematic overestimation of quartz, while allowing iron to be transported farther from its source as impurities than in its pure, crystalline form.",

Lake Carpenter (LC)\ncomprises interbedded limestone and mudstone units of the Ruby Ranch Member of the CMF.\nResults of the chemostratigraphy are constrained by detrital zircons from the section allowing\ncorrelation of the chemostratigraphy to the carbon isotope segments C9 to C11 (Bralower et al.,\n1999) spanning the Late Aptian to Early Albian, and supported by previous litho- and\nchemostratigraphic work in the CMF. δ13Corg values show a pronounced negative stepped\nexcursion, of -6‰ with values reaching -32.3 ‰ occurring in conjunction with an increase in\nTOC. This negative excursion is followed by a positive recovery, with values of ~-25‰ and\nrelatively low TOC. δ13Ccarb records positive values, up to +8‰, in the lowermost part of the\nsection (< ~7m) followed by a decrease to ~-7 ‰. δ18Ocarb over this interval records values\nbetween -2 and -4‰ followed by a decrease to ~-7‰. The lowermost portion of the LC section\nis indicative of relatively deep lacustrine environment in which organic carbon burial influenced\nthe δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake. This lower δ13C of DIC may be due to\nincreased upwelling and/or turnover and recycling of organic carbon in the lake. Variability of\nδ13Ccarb and δ18Ocarb values may reflect changes in water supply to the lake, or climatic variability\nresulting in the lake drying out. δ13Corg values may be affected by local lake dynamics, including\nvariations in organic carbon storage and changes in algal productivity, perhaps also indicative of\nchanges in nutrient availability due to increased run off and/or fluctuations in atmospheric\ncarbon particularly light δ13Corg. Both climatic and hydrological variation in the section may be\ndue to the rise of the Sevier Mountains resulting in an orographic impact on the lake either as a\nresult of increase in high altitude run off, or changes in the amount of precipitation.",

One goal of this work is to estimate DIC, DOC, and POC fluxes from headwater landscapes. For DOC, POC, and CO2, we utilize high-frequency measurements with in situ sensors. We also take discrete samples over a range of hydrologic conditions for independent flux calculations, and to verify the sensor measurements and test proxy relations. In situ fluorescing dissolved organic matter (FDOM) serves as a proxy for DOC. Turbidity is needed to adjust FDOM, and also serves as a proxy for POC. DIC flux is computed from the discrete alkalinity analyses.\nSensor measurements at the five sites – in Colorado, Wisconsin, Vermont, Georgia, and Puerto Rico -- began either in 2011 or 2012. The sensors generally functioned well, but occasional down time required gap filling, typically using strong relations with stream discharge. We computed at least one full year of carbon flux at each site. In this paper we compare sensor-based and sampling-based carbon flux estimates. We interpret the differences among sites in total carbon flux and its relative apportionment among DIC, DOC, and POC, with respect to climate and ecosystem type. Finally, we evaluate the significance of stream carbon flux as a component of the ecosystem carbon balance.",

            "abstract": "The scientific literature is full of studies analyzing future climate change impacts on hydrology with focus on individual catchments. However, we recently found that hydrologic behavior and specific discharge vary considerably even in neighboring and rather similar catchments under current climate conditions and that these variations are related to landscape characteristics. Therefore we hypothesize that these landscape characteristics also play a fundamental role for the sensitivity of a catchment to changing climate conditions. We analyzed the hydrological response of 14 neighboring catchments in Northern Sweden with slightly different topography, land cover, size and geology. Current (1981-2010) and future (2061-2090) streamflow was simulated with the HBV light model. Climate projections were based on 14 regional climate models (ENSEMBLES EU project) and bias-corrected with a distribution-mapping approach. Our simulations revealed that future spring flood peaks will occur much earlier and decrease by 13 to 32 %, whereas winter base flows will increase slightly. These changes are somewhat expected and mainly triggered by a projected increase in winter temperature, which leads to less snow accumulation on the ground. However, these values also highlight that there is a large variability amongst the catchments in their hydrological response to the same future climate conditions. For example, spring flood peaks in catchments without wetlands decrease by only 13 to 15 %, whereas catchments with wetlands show a spring flood peak reduction of 20 to 32 %. In addition to wetlands, we also identified lakes, peat soils and higher elevations as factors that seem to cause a stronger hydrological response to the climate change signal, whereas catchments dominated by forests, steeper slopes and till soils seem to be less strongly affected by a changing climate. Therefore, our results suggest that the sensitivity of catchments to future climate conditions is strongly linked to landscape characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Rutile U-Pb thermochronology is applied successfully by both TIMS and beam methods to date cooling events in mafic and metapelitic rocks, as well as in detrital studies. The Zr-in-rutile thermometer is very robust to thermal diffusion, and generally requires complete recrystallization to change recorded crystallization temperatures. Evidence for diffusion of HFSE elements in rutile is sparse; whereas U-Pb chronology generally records diffusion controlled cooling from the last event.\nThis study follows conventional thermobarometry and U-Pb TIMS results on monazite, sphene and rutile of Möller et al. (1995) establishing a 2 Ga eclogite facies event from MORB-like metabasic, and metapelitic rocks in the Usagaran Orogen of Tanzania, interpreted to be the oldest outcrops of subduction-related eclogites. Rutile from both rock types were discordant near a ca. 500 Ma lower intercept, confirming a thermal overprint postulated on the basis of K-Ar and Rb-Sr mica ages by e.g. Wendt et al. (1972). The age of the eclogite-facies event was confirmed by U-Pb zircon dating of a 1991±2 Ma crosscutting pegmatite (Collins et al., 1999).\nWe present in situ LA-ICP-MS rutile petrochronology on five metabasic and metapelitic eclogite facies samples with variable retrograde amphibolite-facies recrystallization. Thermometry confirms conventional Fe-Mg results, including higher peak temperatures in metabasites. Traverses on rutile inclusions in large garnet prophyroblasts in metapelites show increasing temperatures from cores outwards and a slight decrease towards outermost rims, with peak T coinciding with highest Mg# and highest grossular content, hence consistent with preservation of prograde zoning in the garnets and a brief eclogite facies event. Large rutiles (800µm) in recrystallized samples record temperature zoning profiles. U-Pb results show inheritance of near concordant 2 Ga domains, but dominantly confirm the ca. 490 Ma amphibolite facies overprint.\nThe study is an excellent example of the potential of in-situ rutile petrochronology in complex, polymetamorphic rocks when meticulous attention is given to textural context.\nMöller et al., 1995, Geology, v. 23, p. 1067-1070.\nCollins et al., 2004, Earth Planet.

            "abstract": "Meandering patterns are universal features of tidal landscapes which exert a great influence on the dynamics of tidal channel networks and on the stratigraphy of intertidal platforms. Despite their importance in landscape evolution and their ubiquity, tidal meanders have received less attention when compared to their fluvial counterparts. Quite a few studies, in fact, have focused on the morphodynamic evolution of tidal meanders, together with their planimetric shape and morphometric characteristics. To improve current understanding of tidal meander migration and its possible stratigraphic implications, we have analyzed a sequence of aerial photographs (from 1938 to present day) for a 20 m in diameter, abandoned tidal meander in the Venice Lagoon, and have carried out high-resolution sedimentological and chronostratigraphical analyses of channel deposits. Aerial photographs before and after the cutoff event have been used to infer a minimum velocity of migration. Well-cores have also been collected along a transect crossing through the neck zone in order to evaluate changes in grain size, sedimentation rates across the cutoff event, and gain further insight into the velocity of migration of meander bends. Spatial distribution of sedimentary facies (pointbar sand, oxbowlake and saltmarsh mud), grain size analyses, and 210 Pb and 137Cs chronometers highlighted that meander cutoff occurred progressively around 60 years ago with a velocity of migration of about 0.5m/year. The effectiveness of the methods and the high spatial and temporal resolution of the data call for further investigations and analyses of the type proposed herein, furthermore highlighting the potentiality of the study area as modern analogue for ancient tidal deposits.",

            "abstract": "The fate of soil organic matter with expanding human land use is of increasing concern for planetary health and ecological sustainability. In North American grasslands, cultivation has commonly resulted in loss of stored soil organic carbon to dissolved phases in groundwater and surface water, as well as to atmospheric CO2 via decomposition. In addition, cultivation has released nutrients stored in organic matter and facilitated water movement through soils to benefit crops, increasing groundwater recharge rates. This has altered groundwater chemistry both by changing biogeochemistry of the terrestrial-aquatic interface and by increasing addition of nutrients, herbicides, and pesticides to these systems. In this presentation, we consider the effects of food production practices on terrestrial-aquatic carbon linkages in former grassland ecosystems of western North America. Our data from an agricultural area in central Montana begin to reveal how elevated nitrate and pesticide levels in groundwater on an isolated landform reflect transformation over the last century of a temperate grassland ecosystem for wheat and cattle production. Rates and pathways of carbon and nitrogen loss are inferred from the concentration and isotopic character of both water and carbon and nitrogen over three years in soils, shallow groundwater, emergent springs and surface waters. In this semi-arid, non-irrigated context, the fate of soil organic matter is linked with redistribution of pedogenic carbonate as well as other soil and rock derived solutes. We consider implications for future trends in dissolved carbon and nitrogen in surface waters in the region.",

            "abstract": "The new generation of open-path, low power, laser spectrometers has allowed us to measure methane (CH4) fluxes continuously in remote regions and answer new and exciting questions on the spatial and temporal variability of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes using networks of eddy covariance (EC) towers. Our research is focused in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta where we have installed a regional network of flux towers to assess the impacts of land-use change and ecological restoration on CH4 and CO2 fluxes. The Delta was drained for agriculture over a century ago and has since has experienced high rates of subsidence. It is recognized that agriculture on drained peat soils in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding increases CH4 emissions. We conducted multiple years of simultaneous EC measurements at drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture, a corn field and an alfalfa field) and flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and 3 restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Since these sites are all within 20 km of each other, they share the same basic meteorology, enabling a direct comparison of differences in the C and GHG budgets between sites. Using a multi-tower approach we found that converting drained agricultural peatlands to flooded land-use types can help reverse soil subsidence and reduce GHG emissions from the Delta. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in wetland restoration in California to generate C credits for both the voluntary C market and the state’s cap-and-trade program. However, information on GHG fluxes from restored wetlands is lacking. Using multi-year measurements of GHG fluxes from restored wetlands of varying ages, our research also aims to understand how CO2 and CH4 fluxes from restored wetlands vary during ecosystem development, determine the daily and seasonal forcings controlling these fluxes, and assess management strategies that can help minimize CH4 fluxes and maximize C uptake in restored wetlands. Our multi-year multi-site research program is beginning to answer these questions and bridge understanding between biometeorology, biogeochemistry and climate policy.",

This work included the continuous measurement of liquid water discharge from the geyser and some nearby not springs, and concurrent meteorological measurements. The discharge of the geyser and the hot springs was measured in channels that carry the water to the Firehole River. We found that average measured discharge varies from day to night, likely due to melting of geyser-generated and meteoric snow during warmer daylight hours and freezing of erupted liquid and vapor during the night. The nearby hot springs contribute a nearly constant flow of about 3 l/s to the Firehole River, while during eruptions the total discharge increases to a maximum of about 25 l/s. Two small geysers within 5 meters of the Lone Star Geyser cone were observed to erupt during a time when Lone Star Geyser was not erupting. The water discharged from these small geysers is a very small fraction of that from Lone Star Geyser.",

            "abstract": "Initially thought to be relatively ‘simple’ ecosystems for study, microbial mats have long been considered ideal for any number of research questions. Microbial mats can be found in any number of environments, both natural and manmade, and are typically dependent upon the physiochemical environment for their structure, maintenance and longevity. Ultimately, these and other parameters govern community whereby a microbial mat provides overall ecosystem services to their environment. On the edge of a hotspring in Yellowstone National Park we have found an active microbial mat community that can form a laminated, lithified, accretionary structure that is likely the best example of a living and growing stromatolite. In the outfall channel of the sulfidic Stinking Spring, Utah, we have found examples of both naturally occurring laminated and floating mats where the carbon flux is controlled by abiotic degassing of CO2 rather than metabolism. δ13C-bicarbonate uptake experiments reveal an autotrophic growth rate of 0 – 0.16%/day while δ13C-acetate reveals a higher heterotrophic growth rate of 0.03 – 0.65%/day, which highlights the role of heterotrophs in these mats. Similar growth experiments on Little Hot Creek, California laminated microbial mats reveal a trend for top-down microbial growth with similar microbial taxonomy and diversity to other mat-types. Of a curious note is that incubation experiments with Little Hot Creek mats reveals the importance of particular metals in mat structure and function. Statistically, alpha- and beta-diversity metrics are often used to characterize microbial communities in such systems, but from an analysis of a wastewater treatment system, Hill diversities can better interpret the effective number of species to produce an ecologically intuitive quantity to better understand a microbial mat ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "On June 1, 2014 (UTC) a magnitude 3.2 earthquake occurred east of the town of Greeley, Colorado. The earthquake was widely felt, with reports from Boulder and Golden, over 60 miles away from the epicenter. The location of the earthquake in a region long considered aseismic but now the locus of active oil and gas production prompted the question of whether this was a natural or induced earthquake. Several classic induced seismicity cases hail from Colorado, including the Rocky Mountain Arsenal earthquakes in the 1960s and the Paradox Valley earthquakes in western Colorado. In both cases the earthquakes were linked to wastewater injection. The Greeley earthquake epicenter was close to a Class II well that had been injecting waste fluid into the deepest sedimentary formation of the Denver Basin at rates as high as 350,000 barrels/month for less than a year. The closest seismometers to the June 1 event were more than 100 km away, necessitating deployment of a local seismic network for detailed study. IRIS provided six seismometers to the University of Colorado which were deployed starting within 3 days of the mainshock. Telemetry at one site allowed for real time monitoring of the ongoing seismic sequence. Local media interest was extremely high with speculation that the earthquake was linked to the oil and gas industry. The timetable of media demand for information provided some challenges given the time needed for data collection and analysis. We adopted a policy of open data and open communication with all interested parties, and made proactive attempts to provide information to industry and regulators. After 3 weeks of data collection and analysis, the proximity and timing of the mainshock and aftershocks to the C4A injection well, along with a sharp increase in seismicity culminating in an M 2.6 aftershock, led to a decision by the Colorado Oil and Gas Corporation Commission (COGCC) to recommend a temporary halt to injection at the C4A injection well. This was the first time that such action had been taken by the COGCC. This presentation provides an overview of the interactions among academic researchers, industry, media, and regulators during the period of rapid response to this earthquake sequence, and the role of seismology in informing those responses.",

IFIS is a one-stop web-platform to access community-based flood conditions, forecasts, visualizations, inundation maps and flood-related data, information, and applications. An enormous volume of real-time observational data from a variety of sensors and remote sensing resources (radars, rain gauges, stream sensors, etc.) and complex flood inundation models are staged on a user-friendly maps environment that is accessible to the general public. IFIS has developed into a very successful tool used by agencies, decision-makers, and the general public throughout Iowa to better understand their local watershed and their personal and community flood risk, and to monitor local stream and river levels. IFIS helps communities make better-informed decisions on the occurrence of floods, and alerts communities in advance to help minimize flood damages. IFIS is widely used by general public in Iowa and the Midwest region with over 120,000 unique users, and became main source of information for many newspapers and TV stations in Iowa. IFIS has features for general public to improve emergency preparedness, and for decision makers to support emergency response and recovery efforts.

In the northern Andes such arcs have been considered as controlled by extensional dominated tectonics. Paleomagnetic constraints have also suggested that between the Early and Late Jurassic several crustal domains were translate along the continental margin in association with strain partitioning in the convergent margin.\nA review of the character of the Salado terrane in the Cordillera Real of Ecuador indicates that it includes extensively deformed and metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary rocks that have achieved a greenschist to amphibolite facies event with chloritoid and garnet. This rocks are tightly associated with a ca. 143 Ma syn-tectonic granodiorite to monzogranite batholith that is also extensively milonitized.\nA similar Late Jurassic crustal thickening event that apparently affected volcano-sedimentary rocks have been also recently suspected in the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes in association with Jurassic plutonic rocks (Blanco-Quintero et al., 2013)\nIt is therefore suggested that during the Late Jurassic the Northern Andes experienced significant contractional tectonics. Such crustal thickening may be related to either the active subduction setting were the crustal slivers formed in relation to oblique convergence are transfered and re-accreted to the margin and triggered the deformational event or to a collisional event associated to the arrival of an allocthonous terrane.\nNew geochronological constraints on the metamorphic evolution and precise understanding on the relations between magmatism and deformation are going to be obtain in the Salado Terrane to appropriately test this hypothesis and contribute to the understanding of the extensional to compressional tectonic switching in continental arcs.\nBlanco-Quintero, I.

To understand these changes, we have conducted modeling experiments using NCAR Community Atmosphere Model 3.1_p2 to examine the response of North American storm activity to the elevated tropical Pacific sea surface temperature associated with El Niño. The model experiments were conducted for a period of December to May and configured at a resolution of T85. A storm identification and tracking algorithm was employed to analyze the 6 hourly model output. The results indicate that, when tropical Pacific SST increases, there are more numerous intense storms over southwestern, southeastern, and northwestern North America, but fewer weaker storms over the northeast. Transient eddy analysis of the general circulation demonstrates consistent changes, suggesting systematic changes from large-scale general circulation to synoptic-scale storms. These changes can be attributed to enhanced lower tropospheric baroclinicity, to which the southward shift and an intensification of extratropical jet streams make a major contribution.",

This talk presents results from the second Demonstration Mission that occurred during the intense California drought of spring 2014.\nWith the acquisition of the new cutting edge lidar system, ASO was able to fly higher and as such acquire complete basin coverage for the Tuolumne, Merced, Lakes, and South Fork of Kings River Basins in the California Sierra Nevada. Despite the intensity of the California drought, several snowfalls occurred during the Demonstration Mission and we were able to uniquely map snowfall distribution, providing unprecedented capability to test our understanding of orographics and redistribution of snowfall.\nA new snow density model and analysis were integrated into the ASO data system. Despite a > 4-fold increase in data volume from the new lidar, the landing-to-data delivery remained at < 24 hrs. ASO SWE and albedo data are assimilated into models of varying complexity and results presented here. We use the ASO data in the Sierra Nevada to evaluate SWE simulations from the NWS SNODAS and SWE reconstruction models. Finally, the ASO data were watched carefully during the drought, suggesting that the Hetch Hetchy reservoir original infrastructure’s forecast of falling well short of fill would be biased low and that the reservoir would come close to filling.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges of hydrological modelling in semiarid areas is the high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and subsequent associated hydrological processes, coupled with an inherent non-linearity of response between rainfall and runoff. The problem often gets worse due to a lack of instrumentation of good spatial coverage, which increases input errors and uncertainties when spatial rainfall estimates are made from limited observations for use as input to rainfall-runoff models. This particular problem is well documented for many catchments in the world, including the semiarid southern Africa and has largely promoted the use of lumped models over distributed models in data scarce areas which often fail to adequately represent hydrological processes, and, thus, in addressing key water resources management issues at sub basin levels. One of the major issues these models are unable to address, is the effect of upstream land use changes on flow regimes in the downstream watershed. The Gaborone dam catchment located within a 20 km radius from Gaborone city in Botswana has been experiencing challenges of reduced inflows into the dam, despite some recorded heavy storms in the head streams and within the catchment. Recent studies indicate that there are more than 200 farm dams spread across the 400 km2 catchment which may have led to reduced inflows into the dam, representing a main source of water supply to the greater Gaborone area. However, due to insufficient rainfall recording instruments and flow gauging stations in the catchment, no studies had been able to adequately address runoff generation processes and associated inflow dynamics in this important catchment. Through the present study, an experimental hydrological site has been established, consisting of five automated weather stations and two gauging stations to capture spatial rainfall and flow variability within the catchment. This study has taken an integrated approach by considering (i) a multi-site rainfall modeling approach based on generalized linear models, as well as (ii) land use and remote sensing products as input to (iii) a process-based distributed hydrological model known as JAMS/J2000. As shown by improved calibration results, preliminary results are encouraging that dominant processes are better represented.",

            "abstract": "Cropping intensity is the number of crops grown per year per unit area of cropland. Since 1970s, the Phoenix Active Management Area (AMA) has undergone rapid urbanization mostly via land conversions from agricultural prime lands to urban land use. Agricultural intensification, or multiple cropping, has been observed globally as a positive response to the growing land pressure as a consequence of urbanization and exploding population. Nevertheless, increased cropping intensity has associated local, regional, and global environmental outcomes such as degradation of water quality and soil fertility. Quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of cropping intensity can serve as a first step towards understanding these environmental problems and developing effective and sustainable cropping strategies. In this study, an adaptive threshold method was developed to measure the cropping intensity in the Phoenix AMA from 1995 to 2010 at five-year intervals. The method has several advantages in terms of (1) minimization of errors arising from missing data and noise; (2) ability to distinguish growing cycles from multiple small false peaks in a vegetation index time series; (3) flexibility when dealing with temporal profiles with diffing numbers of observations. The adaptive threshold approach measures the cropping intensity effectively with overall accuracies higher than 97%. Results indicate a dramatic decline in the area of total croplands, single crops, and double crops. A small land conversion was witnessed from single crops into double crops from 1995 to 2000, whereas a reverse trend was observed from 2005 to 2010. Changes in cropping intensity can affect local water consumption. Therefore, joint investigation of cropping patterns and agricultural water use can provide implications for future water demand, which is an increasingly critical issue in this rapidly expanding desert city.",

On board is the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument suite. ROSINA consists of two mass spectrometers, the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) and the Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF), as well as the COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS).\nThe first signal with ROSINA/RTOF of the gaseous environment of the comet was a significant increase in water density observed on DOY 218.1 of 2014 (at 3.5 AU) by RTOF above the gaseous envelope of the Rosetta spacecraft. A similar density increase is observed by COPS at the same time. A preliminary analysis shows that the water density is nH2O ≈ 1012 m–3 at 100 km distance from the comet (located at 3.5 AU from the Sun). This gives a density at the surface of nH2O ≈ 6.4·1015 m–3 and a vertical column density of water of NCH2O ≈ 6.5·1018 m–2. Assuming an active area of 4% we arrive at a production rate of QH2O ≈ 5.8·1024 mole s–1. These values are preliminary and will be refined by forthcoming observations. Other than water, no signal related to cometary activity could be observed above the molecular background from the spacecraft at present, e.g. cometary CO and CO2 are not observed in the RTOF data so far. This hints at a possible deficiency of carbon bearing compounds in the comet.",

            "abstract": "The newly commissioned Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has revealed the presence of a numerous weak and short lived low frequency radio solar bursts. These emission features have duration of order a second, have relatively narrow spectral widths and are surprisingly numerous even during quiet solar conditions. Their appearance in the time-frequency plane is unlike that of the any of the known classes of radio bursts, and they at least an order of magnitude weaker than the weakest type III bursts routinely monitored and reported (e.g. by Automated Radio Burst Identification System operational at the Learmonth Radioheliograph in Australia). For the few bursts which have been studied in detail, we have not found a counterpart at X-Ray or EUV bands. There is an exciting possibility that these bursts are associated with the widely hypothesized \"nanoflares\" thought to play a role in coronal heating through magnetic reconnection on small scales in coronal loops. A systematic and detailed characterization of the statistical properties of these bursts over large temporal and spectral spans is necessary for investigating the role these bursts might play in coronal heating. To enable this, we have developed a novel system using region-growing, wavelet decompositions, and thresholding techniques for event recognition and parameter extraction in an automated manner for the voluminous MWA interferometric data. We will present and describe the statistical properties of these weak radio bursts based on a large number of events detected and parameterized by these automated methods.",

            "abstract": "Variations in radiogenic isotope ratios and magmatic volatile abundances (e.g., CO2 or H2O) in Hawaiian lavas reveal key processes within a deep-seated mantle plume (e.g., mantle heterogeneity, source lithology, partial melting, and magma degassing). Shield-stage Hawaiian lavas likely originate from a mixed plume source containing peridotite and recycled oceanic crust (pyroxenite) based on variations of radiogenic isotopes (e.g., 206Pb/204Pb). The mantle source region may also be heterogeneous with respect to volatile contents, yet the link between pre-eruptive volatile budgets and mantle source lithology in the Hawaiian plume is poorly constrained due to shallow magmatic degassing and mixing. Here, we use a novel approach to investigate this link using Os isotopic ratios, and major, trace, and volatile elements in olivines and mineral-hosted melt inclusions (MIs) from 34 samples from Koolau, Mauna Loa, Hualalai, Kilauea, and Loihi. These samples reveal a strong correlation between volatile contents in olivine-hosted MIs and Os isotopes of the same olivines, in which lavas that originated from greater proportions of recycled oceanic crust/pyroxenite (i.e. ‘Loa’ chain volcanoes: Koolau, Mauna Loa, Loihi) have MIs with the lower H2O, F, and Cl contents than ‘Kea’ chain volcanoes (i.e. Kilauea) that contain greater amounts of peridotite in the source region. No correlation is observed with CO2 or S. The depletion of fluid-mobile elements (H2O, F, and Cl) in ‘Loa’ chain volcanoes indicates ancient dehydrated oceanic crust is a plume component that controls much of the compositional variation of Hawaiian Volcanoes. The presence of dehydrated recycled mafic material in the plume source suggests that subduction effectively devolatilizes the mafic part of the oceanic crust. These results are similar to the observed shifts in H2O/Ce ratios near the Easter and Samoan hotspots [1,2]. Thus, it appears that multiple hotspots may record relative H2O depletions and possibly other volatiles. [1] Dixon et al. 2002, Nature 420:385-89 [2] Workman et al. 2006, EPSL 241:932-51",

Upward and escape fluxes of the secondary energetic He and O atoms and H2, N2, CO and CO2 molecules, induced by precipitating ENAs, have been determined and their non-thermal energy distribution functions have been computed at different altitudes for different solar conditions.

            "abstract": "Marine shale successions are probably the best archives of earth history. The degree of completeness of a marine shale succession is a critical factor in the interpretation of the geologic record of climatic, oceanic, and biogeochemical processes, in the prediction of timescales of those processes, in the determination of the duration of events, and in the establishment of correlations between successions. The sedimentation rates of marine shale successions are often calculated by dividing the thickness of a succession by the duration of the stratigraphic interval it occupies. Sedimentation rates calculated this way are always much lower than rates measured directly in equivalent modern environments. When we apply modern rates to the deposits left behind by their ancient equivalents, and correct for compaction due to overburden and time, we find that the entire succession can be deposited in a relatively short time. Since we know that the stratigraphic interval occupied by such ancient deposits is much longer, we must conclude that the succession is very incomplete. In this presentation, I will use a few different methods to show that 65 to >80% of the duration of the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in Yorkshire, U.K., is represented by gaps rather than shale. This means that the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event is not as short as proposed by authors who studied the cyclostratigraphy of the Yorkshire succession, and that it probably represents a much longer-term history of environmental change driven by processes acting on longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "In 1989, Joe Kirschvink applied a nascent planetary climate theory—the self-reversing ice-albedo instability—to Neoproterozoic geology, citing paleomagnetic evidence that ancient Australian glaciers reached tidewater near the paleo-equator. He attributed the “snowball Earth” to a unique preponderance of low-latitude continents, and inferred that complex life including metazoa were spawned in the nutrient-rich glacial aftermath. There have been major advances in models and data since 1989, and gratifying convergences between them. In models, frozen oceans coexist with dynamic ice sheets, as demanded by geological data. Geochronological data show that snowball glaciations were prolonged and their terminations globally synchronous, as required by geochemical models for snowball deglaciation. In models, zonal average sources and sinks of water vapor are reversed in snowball atmospheres relative to climate states with ice lines (at low or high-latitude). Ice-covered oceans are well mixed, by true thermohaline meridional overturning and related jets, with implications for data linking iconic snowball iron-formations with silled basins. Triple oxygen isotope data from sulfate robustly supports model predictions of atmospheric CO2 required for snowball deglaciation, while promising results have been obtained from a variety of pH, weathering, productivity and redox sensitive proxies. The known first appearances of sponge biomarkers and metazoan embryos bracket the terminal Cryogenian snowball glaciation. Existing model-data conflicts are good targets for future research. Boron isotopes in syndeglacial cap dolomites consistently imply catastrophic ocean acidification upon deglaciation, while models suggest that the existence of cap dolomites implies that seawater acidified gradually and was buffered by the dissolution of carbonate, delivered by glaciers. Above all, the newly emerging Cryogenian chronology (highlighted in this session) presents new puzzles. Two low-latitude glaciations of grossly unequal longevity occurred in rapid succession. The Sturtian was 55-60 Myr long, followed a 109-yr glacial hiatus, and was distinguished by Fe2O3-rich sedimentary deposits; the Marinoan was 5-20 Myr long, followed a 107-yr glacial hiatus, and was distinguished by BaSO4-rich cap dolomite.",

            "abstract": "Determining of concrete strength can be used by destructive or non-destructive methods. Concrete strength is determined with uniaxial compressive test as destructive in laboratory and with Seismic Ultrasonic P- (Compressional) and S-wave (Shear) measurements as non-destructive in-situ or laboratory. In this study, strength of saturated concrete is investigated by using seismic P and S-wave velocities. For this, concrete samples were formed with using the cube samples in size 15x15x15cm. Different strength designs were made for obtain different strengths in these samples. The aim is to create concrete strengths of between the lowest 5MPa and the highest 100 MPa. After the end of the curing time of created the cube concrete samples Seismic P and S waves measurements were made in the laboratory by Ultrasonic test equipment. Hence, P and S wave velocities of the sample were calculated. After these, for determine the strength of the samples uniaxial compression strength test was performed. As a result, P and S wave velocities and concrete strength values of concrete samples were obtained. By correlating these values over %90 exponential relationships were determined. By using this relationship, concrete strength can be determined sensitively from P and S wave velocities. In addition, by using P and S wave velocities elastic parameters values and Poisson's ratio of concrete specimens can be calculated.\nKeywords: Concrete, Strength, Compressional and Shear-wave velocities, Empirical Relationship",

            "abstract": "After the big 2004 Sumatra earthquake, the tsunami threat posed by large earthquakes occurring in the Mediterranean sea was formally taken into account by many countries around the Mediterranean basin. In the past, large earthquakes that originated significant tsunamis occurred nearly once per century (Maramai et al., 2014, Annals of Geophysics).\nThe Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) received a mandate from the international community to coordinate the establishment of the ICG/NEAMTWS (http://neamtic.ioc-unesco.org) through Resolution IOC-XXIII-14. Since then, several countries (France, Turkey, Greece) have started operating as candidate Tsunami Watch Provider (cTWP) in the Mediterranean.\nItaly started operating as cTWP on October 1st, 2014. The Italian cTWP is formed by INGV (“Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia)”, DPC (“Dipartimento di Protezione Civile”) and ISPRA (“Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale”). INGV is in charge of issuing the alert for potentially tsunamigenic earthquakes, ISPRA provides the sea level recordings and DPC is in charge of disseminating the alert. \nINGV established the tsunami alert center (CAT, “Centro di Allerta Tsunami”) at the end of 2013. CAT is co-located with the INGV national seismic surveillance center operated since many years. In this work, we show the technical and personnel organization of CAT, its response to recent earthquakes, and the new procedures under development for implementation.\n(*) INGV-CAT WG: Amato A., Basili R., Bernardi F., Bono A., Danecek P., De Martini P.M., Govoni A., Graziani L., Lauciani V., Lomax, A., Lorito S., Maramai A., Mele F., Melini D., Molinari I., Nostro C., Piatanesi A., Pintore S., Quintiliani M., Romano F., Selva J., Selvaggi G., Sorrentino D., Tonini R.",

            "abstract": "The recently developed NOAA Water instrument is a two-channel, closed-path, tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer designed for the measurement of water vapor and enhanced total water (vapor + inertially enhanced condensed-phase) from the NASA Global Hawk unmanned aircraft system (UAS) or other high-altitude research aircraft. Combining the measurements from the two channels allows the determination of cloud ice water content (IWC), an important metric for evaluating the radiative properties of cirrus clouds.\nThe instrument utilizes wavelength-modulated spectroscopy with second harmonic detection near 2694 nm to achieve high precision with a 79 cm double-pass optical path. The detection cells are operated under constant temperature, pressure and flow conditions to maintain a constant sensitivity to H2O independent of the ambient sampling environment. An on-board calibration system is used to perform periodic in situ calibrations to verify the stability of the instrument sensitivity during flight. For the water vapor channel, ambient air is sampled perpendicular to the flow past the aircraft in order to reject cloud particles, while the total water channel uses a heated, forward-facing inlet to sample both water vapor and cloud particles. The total water inlet operates subisokinetically, thereby inertially enhancing cloud particle number in the sample flow and affording increased cirrus IWC sensitivity.\nThe NOAA Water instrument was flown for the first time during the second deployment of the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) in February-March 2013 on board the Global Hawk UAS. The instrument demonstrated a typical in-flight precision (1 s, 1 σ) of better than 0.17 parts per million (ppm, 10-6 mol/mol), with an overall H2O vapor measurement uncertainty of 5% ± 0.23 ppm. The inertial enhancement for cirrus cloud particle sampling under ATTREX flight conditions ranged from 33-48 for ice particles larger than 8 µm in diameter, depending primarily on aircraft altitude. The resulting IWC detection limit (2 σ) was 0.023-0.013 ppm, corresponding to approximately 2 µg m-3, with an estimated overall uncertainty of 20%.",

            "abstract": "In this study we analysed rocks and noble gas composition of fluid inclusions (FIs) hosted in olivine crystals contained in a suite of eruptive products of the last 10ka of activity of Turrialba volcano, Cordillera Central, Costa Rica. The suite of analyzed rocks display a calc-alkaline affinity, ranging in composition from basaltic-andesite to dacite. Trace element patterns indicate a typical behavior of subduction-related magmas and also the clear contribution of an OIB-like signature at source. A group of andesites displays also adakite-like geochemical features, as evidenced by their constant depletion in HFSE elements. Sr isotope (0.703593 - 0.703678) and Nd isotope ratios (0.512960 - 0.512968) suggest that Turrialba magmas belong to one of the less contaminated mantle source of Central America. The 3He/4He ratio of fluid inclusions from the most mafic eruptive products (basaltic-andesites) varies from 7.86 to 8.07 Ra, while that from andesite lavas varies from 7.03 to 7.18 Ra. In order to understand the mantle source feeding Turrialba volcano, we performed a geochemical investigation on fumarolic gases of summit craters. The He isotope composition of dry gases of Turrialba volcano is characterized by extremely high R/Ra values (7.08-7.96 Ra). The highest 3He/4He ratios were measured at both West and Central Craters (7.93–7.96 Ra and 7.78–7.88 Ra, respectively), and are the highest values of the entire Central America. Despite the observed variability, the 3He/4He ratio of fumarolic gases and FIs from Turrialba volcano is well in the range of arc related volcanism (~7–8 Ra; Hilton et al., 2002), and represents the signature of a mantle wedge in which the contamination by crustal fluids is small to negligible. In addition the occurrence of recent adakite-like magmatism suggests the presence of an abnormal heating of the subducting lithosphere under Turrialba volcano, allowing even old or cold oceanic crust to melt.",

            "abstract": "Hong Kong is situated in the Pearl River delta of Southern China. This region has experienced phenomenal economic growth in the past 30 years. Emissions of large amount of pollutants from urban areas and various industries coupled with subtropical climate have led to frequent occurrences of severe photochemical air pollution. Despite the long-term control efforts of the Hong Kong government, the atmospheric levels of ozone have been increasing in the past decade. To obtain an updated and more complete understanding of photochemical smog, an integrative study has been conducted during 2010-2014. Several intensive measurement campaigns were carried out at urban, suburban and rural sites in addition to the routine observations at fourteen air quality monitoring stations in Hong Kong. Meteorological, photochemical, and chemical-transport modeling studies were conducted to investigate the causes/processes of elevated photochemical pollution . The main activities of this study were to (1) examine the situation and trends of photochemical air pollution in Hong Kong, (2) understand some underlying chemical processes in particular the poorly-understood heterogeneous processes of reactive nitrogen oxides, (3) quantify the local, regional, and super-regional contributions to the ozone pollution in Hong Kong, and (4) review the control policy and make further recommendations based on the science. This paper will give an overview of this study and present some key results on the trends and chemistry of the photochemical pollution in this polluted subtropical region.",

            "abstract": "International aid is increasingly focused on adaptation to climate change. At recent meetings of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the developed world agreed to rapidly increase international assistance to help the developing world respond to the impacts of climate change. Here, we examine the decision-making challenges facing internationally supported climate change adaptation projects given the large uncertainty in future climate predictions, using the example of efforts to implement coastal protection measures (e.g. sea walls, mangrove planting) in Kiribati. The central equatorial Pacific country is home to the Kiribati Adaptation Project, the first national-level climate change adaptation project supported by the World Bank.\nDrawing on interview and document research conducted over an 8-year period, we trace the forces influencing decisions about coastal protection measures, starting from the variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, through the trade-offs between different measures, to the social, political, and economic context in which decisions are finally made. We then discuss how sub-optimal adaptation measures may be implemented despite years of planning, consultation, and technical studies. This qualitative analysis of the real-world process of climate change adaptation reveals that embracing a culturally appropriate and short-term (~20 years) planning horizon, while not ignoring the longer-term future, may reduce the influence of scientific uncertainty on decisions and provide opportunities to learn from mistakes, reassess the science, and adjust suboptimal investments.",

            "abstract": "This study presents the geomorphological and sedimentological analysis of a modern carbonate source-to-sink system located north of Madagascar (SW Indian Ocean). The sedimentary system is composed of an isolated carbonate platform sited on top of a seamount rising steeply from the seabed located at 3000 m water depth. The slope of the seamount is incised by canyons, and meandering channels occur above lobbed sedimentary bodies at the foot of the slope. The dataset consists of dredges, sediment piston cores, swath bathymetry and seismic (sparker and 2D high-resolution) lines collected from inner platform (less than 5 m deep) to the adjacent deep sedimentary basin. Particle size analysis and composition of carbonate grains are used to characterize the distribution and heterogeneity of sands accumulated on the archipelago. Main results show that composition of carbonate sediments is dominated by segments of Halimeda, large benthic foraminifera, coral debris, molluscs, echinoderms, bryozoans and sponges. According to the shape and the position of sandwaves and intertidal sandbars developed in the back-barrier reef, the present organization of these well-sorted fine-sand accumulations appears to be strongly influenced by flood tidal currents. Seismic lines acquired from semi-enclosed to open lagoon demonstrate that most of the sediment is exported and accumulated along the leeward margin of the platform, which is connected to a canyon network incising the outer slope. Following the concept of highstand shedding of carbonate platforms (Schlager et al., 1994), excess sediment is exported by plumes and gravity flows to the adjacent deep sea where it feeds a carbonate deep-sea fan. Combined observations from platform to basin allow to explain how the Glorieuses carbonate source to sink system has evolved under the influence of climate and of relative sea-level changes since the last interglacial.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands cover less than 5% of Earth’s ice-free land surface but exert major impacts on global biogeochemistry, hydrology, and biological diversity. Despite the importance of these environments in the global cycling of carbon and water, there is a scarcity of suitable regional-to-global remote-sensing data for characterizing their distribution and dynamics. We have been assembling a global-scale Earth System Data Record (ESDR) of natural Inundated Wetlands to facilitate investigations on their role in climate, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and biodiversity. The ESDR comprises (1) Fine-resolution (100 meter) maps, delineating wetland extent, vegetation type, and seasonal inundation dynamics for regional to continental-scale areas covering crucial wetland regions, and (2) global coarse-resolution (~25 km), multi-temporal mappings of inundated area fraction (Fw) across multiple years. The fine-scale ESDR component is constructed from L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The global maps of inundated area fraction are obtained by combining coarse-resolution (~25 km) remote sensing observations from passive and active microwave instruments.\nSurface water and inundated vegetation is classified at 100m resolution using ALOS PALSAR imagery. We combine multiple passive/active microwave data sets to quantify Fwat 25 km resolution producing a daily product with ~weekly temporal composites from 1992-2013. We compare information content and accuracy of the coarse resolution data sets relative to the SAR-based data sets. This ESDR will provide the first high-resolution, accurate, consistent and comprehensive global-scale data set of wetland inundation and vegetation. We present details of assembly of this ESDR, discussing aspects of remote sensing data collections, data processing and staging, algorithm application and adaptation to contemporary data streams, cross-product harmonization, and considerations for distribution with the user community.\nThis work was carried out in part within the framework of the ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative.

            "abstract": "Surface remobilization of mineral resources in cratons and shields may essentially be investigated through the study of regolith production and mobility at various scales in the landscape. This provides tools for exploration but also constrains the sediment routing system at the source of many passive margins. Here we develop a regolith mapping protocol at the scale of Southwestern Burkina Faso, which exposes mineralized Paleoproterozoic granite-greenstone terrains and their Neoproterozoic sandstone cover. Mapping is based on a combination of field survey and the interpretation of radiometric data, satellite images and digital topography. The best preserved lateritic regolith unit with clear-cut and unambiguous characteristics are ferricrete capping plateau relicts of a pediment surface called the High glacis, which developed throughout West Africa between ca. 24 and 11 my ago. Topographic reconstruction at 11 Ma based on the distribution of High glacis relicts was used to quantify landscape evolution. Results show that the modern drainage was mostly established at 11 Ma. The initial geometry and dissection of the High glacis slopes were then influenced by their position with respect to watersheds and lithology, impacting the different scales of redistribution in the area. By subtracting the current DEM to the High glacis topography, post-11 Ma denudation is calibrated between 0 and 8 m/my with a very low average (2 m/my). Such regime corresponds to a cratonic background ‘noise’ that is weathering-limited. Results also suggest a minimum timescale in the order of 20 my for resurfacing the landscape, providing new constraints for modelling both the sediment routing system and the surface remobilization of mineralizations. Finally, using our findings, we identify two type-configurations where exploration strategies might be refined: one where High glacis relicts potentially mask mineralized units and one where surface index may originate from lateral remobilization.",

            "abstract": "Folded structures in the tropopause, so-called tropopause folds, are intimately linked to upper-level frontogenesis and jet-stream dynamics. They play an important role for stratosphere-troposphere exchange, the dynamical coupling of upper- and lower troposphere, and can be important for generating severe weather events. Together with the filamentation and roll-up of streamers and the formation of cut-off lows, tropopause folds are a prime example for the complex dynamical structure of the UTLS on time scales from hours to days. For case studies, in-situ data or detailed manual analysis of model output often allow for an unambiguous identification of the tropopause. Obtaining a global, long-term perspective of this phenomenon, however, requires an automated and objective identification method. We present an elaborated three-dimensional labelling algorithm, based on an isosurface of potential vorticity (PV), that allows to objectively separate stratospheric and tropospheric air in complex situations in polar regions and in situations with diabatically and/or frictionally generated PV anomalies typically found near extratropical cyclones. We apply this algorithm to the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set from 1979 to 2012 to compile a robust global climatology of tropopause folds. We present geographical and seasonal distributions of fold frequencies for three classes of folds as defined by their vertical extent (shallow, medium and deep). Typical synoptic situations associated with deep tropopause folds like cyclonically curved jets are discussed and we investigate their potential impact on extreme weather events. For example, the frequency of wind speed extremes at 700 hPa is in many areas significantly higher if a tropopause fold is present.",

            "abstract": "Lack of observations for the full range of required variables is a critical reason why many cryosphere-dominated hydrological modelling studies adopt a temperature index (degree day) approach to meltwater simulation rather than resolving the full surface energy balance. Thus spatial observations of \"degree days\" would be extremely useful in constraining model parameterisations. Even for models implementing a full energy balance, \"degree day\" observations provide a characterisation of the spatial distribution of climate inputs to the cryosphere-hydrological system.\nThis study derives \"degree days\" for the Upper Indus Basin by merging remote sensing data products: snow cover duration (SCD), from MOD10A1 and land surface temperature (LST), from MOD11A1 and MYD11A1. Pixel-wise “degree days” are calculated, at imagery-dependent spatial resolution, by multiplying SCD by (above-freezing) daily LST. This is coherent with the snowpack-energy-to-runoff conversion used in temperature index algorithms. This allows assessment of the spatial variability of mass inputs (accumulated snowpack) because in nival regime areas – where complete ablation is regularly achieved – mass is the limiting constraint. The GLIMS Randolph Glacier Inventory is used to compare annual totals and seasonal timings of “degree days” over glaciated and nival zones. Terrain-classified statistics (by elevation and aspect) for the MODIS “degree-day” hybrid product are calculated to characterise of spatial precipitation distribution.\nWhile MODIS data products provide detailed spatial resolution relative to tributary catchment areas, the limited instrument record length is inadequate for assessing climatic trends and greatly limits use for hydrological model calibration and validation. While multi-decadal MODIS equivalent data products may be developed in the coming years, at present alternative methods are required for “degree day” trend analysis. This study thus investigates the use of the hybrid MODIS “degree day” product to downscale an ensemble of modern global meteorological reanalyses including ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, NASA MERRA and JRA-55 which overlap MODIS instrument record. This downscaling feasibility assessment is a prerequisite to applying the method to regional climate projections.",

            "abstract": "In the oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) of the global ocean fixed nitrogen is lost primarily by heterotrophic denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation by nitrite (anammox). As it is projected that the OMZ expand in future due to global warming there is an urgent need to understand the controlling mechanisms of nitrogen loss within these regions. However, most Earth system models (ESM) rather have a poor representation of nitrogen related processes, primarily focusing only on nitrate. This simplification of the nitrogen cycle could contribute to the common model bias of too large and too intense OMZ in most ESM.\nWe set up a more comprehensive marine N-cycle including interactions between nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and organic material in the water column and the sediments in the framework of the global biogeochemical ocean model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. We present a global marine nitrogen budget and discuss changes in the subsurface oxygen distributions. We find that the representation of a stepwise dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite and ammonium improves the simulated OMZs and captures observed features like the secondary nitrite maximum.",

            "abstract": "Rapidly growing cities in arid regions present a significant water management challenge. Key to tackling this challenge is understanding how and why some cities transition to more sustainable water management; acknowledging that urban water resources decisions are both responding to and precipitating hydrologic change, this question is best tackled through a sociohydrology approach. While coupling of natural and societal systems is in it’s infancy in the field of hydrology, there is a strong tradition of studying coupled systems in the field of Socio-Ecological Systems. We build on Ostrom’s Socio-Ecological Systems framework to develop a system dynamics model of water management for the Las Vegas metropolitan area using Vensim. A key objective our proposed modeling framework is to illuminate the dynamic interactions of the sociohydrologic system components and enable testing of various assumptions and strategies.\nThe model of Las Vegas water management consists of five sub-modules: water supply, water demand, finances, public perception and policy making process. The development of the first three modules were based on clearly defined system structure. The public perception sub-module tracks the level public risk perception of a water supply shortage and represents the hypothesis that public risk perception is updated periodically when shortage events are experienced. The policy making process module uses an algorithm capturing the hypothesized decision making process to select policy actions (or in-action) from a set of feasible actions in response to the system states tracked by the model and observable to decision makers.\nThe model was tested and parameterized using mix of quantitative data on water demands, supplies and costs and qualitative data from document analysis and interview data covering 1990 to 2010 period. Given that not only the parameters but also the structure of the public perception and the policy making process sub-systems is contested, a different approach must be taken to assess the robustness of these modules. Presented here is the development of the model, results of model testing against the historic reference modes using Las Vegas as an example, and future work planned to improve the robustness of the model.",

The Cassini, STEREO, and the future Solar Orbiter mission are embarking goniopolarmetric radio receiver connected to 3 electric wire antennas. Such instrument provides the spectral matrix (or part of it) from which the wave parameters can be derived. They require a point source assumption (plane wave) to derive the direction of arrival of the wave, the polarization and the flux density. In case of a spatially extended source (disk shaped, with a given radial profile), the source centroid direction and the apparent source size can also be derived. This type of instrumentation cannot provide much more parameters, as there is a maximum of to 9 independent measurements for each time-frequency step (i.e. an instantaneous set of measurements). Radio maps can be produced a posteriori combining consecutive data at the cost of averaging out small scale temporal variations. Furthermore, these inversion do not allow solving for several sources, or for complex source geometry.\nWe present a concept of radioastronomy instrumentation using a swarm of small satellites (possibly cubesats) with sensitive radio receivers measuring the wave front and phase of the radio waves on each spacecraft. This instrument will also provide 3-dimensional interferometric measurement from which real imaging capabilities will arise, as it is now occurring on ground at frequencies above 15 MHz, with the LOFAR interferometer in Europe, or the LWA in teh USA. The proposed concept will be very complementary to these instruments, as they will be orepating from a few kHz to a few 10 Mhz from space, and thus not affected by the ionospheric cutoff at 10 MHz.\nSuch resolved imaging capabilities of the inner heliosphere would be a real step forward to better understand the radio emissions mechanisms and the energetic at the orgin of the radio sources, as well as the propagation processes. We will present the various existing projects and the roadmap to reach this goal.",

Today, such eruptions are still a concern to the nearly 3 million people living in the Naples metropolitan area. Understanding the source for Mt. Somma-Vesuvius magma and the coexisting volatile phase is vital to better constrain the long-term eruptive behavior of this volcano.\nIn the present study, ~ 50 olivine phenocrysts were selected from lavas and pumices produced during mild effusive events referred to as inter-Plinian eruptions, and from highly explosive Plinian eruptions that occurred at Mt. Somma-Vesuvius between 33000 ka and 1631 AD. Selected olivine phenocrysts containing MI were examined petrographically and analyzed for Fo content. Fo varies from 69 to 73 mole% for inter-Plinian olivine crystals and from 84 to 90 mole% with one zoned olivine containing 76-81 mole% Fo, for Plinian olivine crystals. Investigated MI vary from slightly crystallized to highly crystallized.\nSelected crystallized MI were reheated using the Vernadsky stage, and quenched to a homogeneous glass (Group 1) or glass plus a vapor bubble (Group 2). On one hand, MI of Group 1 are hosted in olivine ranging from Fo72 to Fo76 and were all erupted from the Pompeii eruption (white pumice deposit). On the other hand, MI of Group 2 are trapped in olivine ranging from Fo69 to Fo81 and from Fo84 to Fo90, and the hosts are representative of both Plinian and inter-Plinian events. The only eruption where Group-1 and Group-2 MI coexist is the Pompeii eruption.\nGroup 2 MIs were further analyzed by Raman to test for the presence of volatiles (CO2 or H2O) in the vapor bubbles. CO2 was detected in all MI analyzed. CO2 density was determined using the distance between the two Fermi-diad peaks, and ranges between 0.14 and 0.55 g/cm3. Six MI also showed evidence for H2O in the vapor bubble. In addition, carbonates were detected at the glass-vapor interface of five MI.\nThis study shows that the CO2-rich fluid phase, which might exsolve from Plinian melts contain a significant amount of H2O. In addition, the first melting temperature of the fluids in the vapor bubble (~ -58ºC) suggests that volatile components, other than CO2, are included in the vapor bubbles.",

A recent global study shows that between 1976 and 2007 about 55% of the seismic moment released within subduction zones was actually not released at the megathrust interface. Their role and spatiotemporal occurrence, however, remain poorly understood. We for the first time simulate their spontaneous activation and propagation using a newly developed 2D, physically consistent, continuum, visco-elasto-plastic seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) modeling approach. The characteristics of simulated normal events within the outerrise and splay and normal antithetic events within the wedge resemble seismic and seismological observations in terms of location, geometry, and timing. Their occurrence agrees reasonably well with both long-term analytical predictions based on dynamic Coulomb wedge theory and short-term quasi-static stress changes resulting from the typically triggering megathrust event. The impact of off-megathrust faulting on the megathrust cycle is distinct, as more both shallower and slower megathrust events arise due to occasional off-megathrust triggering and increased updip locking. This also enhances tsunami hazards, which are amplified due to the steeply dipping fault planes of especially outerrise events.",

Using well-accepted standard protocols such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), GIBS delivers global imagery efficiently and responsively. Behind this service, lies The Imagery Exchange (TIE), a workflow data management solution developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. TIE is an Open Archival Information System responsible for orchestrating the workflow for acquisition, preparation, generation, and archiving of imagery to be served by the GIBS’ web mapping tile service, OnEarth. The workflow collects imagery provenance throughout a product’s lifecycle by leveraging the EOS Clearing House (ECHO) and other long-term metadata repositories in order to promote reproducibility. Through this focus on metadata, TIE provides spatial and temporal searching capabilities such as an OpenSearch interface as well as facilitating the generation of metadata standards such as the OGC GetCapabilities. Designed as a scalable system, TIE’s subsystems can scale-up or scale-down depending on the data volume it handles through the usage of popular open source technologies such as Apache Zookeeper and Grails.\nThis presentation will cover the challenges and solutions to developing such a horizontally scalable data management system where science products are often varied with disparate provenance pertaining to source platforms and instruments, spatial resolutions, processing algorithms, metadata models and packaging specifications.",

Indeed, they have a significant role on deformation during basin evolution, particularly on fault reactivation. The Lodève Permian Basin (Hérault, France) is an exhumed half graben with exceptional outcrop conditions providing access to barite-sulfides mineralized systems and hydrocarbon trapped into rollover faults of the basin.\nArchitectural studies shows a cyclic infilling of fault zone and associated S0-parallel veins according to three main fluid events during dextral/normal faulting. Contrasting fluid entrapment conditions are deduced from textural analysis, fluid inclusion microthermometry and sulfide isotope geothermometer: (i) the first stage is characterized by an implosion breccia cemented by silicifications and barite during abrupt pressure drop within fault zone; (ii) the second stage consists in succession of barite ribbons precipitated under overpressure fluctuations, derived from fault-valve action, with reactivation planes formed by sulphide-rich micro-shearing structures showing normal movement; and (iii) the third stage is associated to the formation of dextral strike-slip pull-apart infilling by large barite crystals and contemporary hydrocarbons under suprahydrostatic pressure values.\nMicrothermometry, sulfide and strontium isotopic compositions of the barite-sulfides veins indicate that all stages were formed by mixing between deep basinal fluids at 230°C, derived from cinerite dewatering, and formation water from overlying sedimentary cover channelized trough fault planes.\nWe conclude to a polyphase history of fluid trapping during Permian synrift formation of the basin: (i) a first event, associated with the dextral strike-slip motion on faults, leads to a first sealing of the fault zone; (ii) periodic reactivations of fault planes and bedding-controlled shearing form the main mineralized ore bodies by the single action of fluid overpressure fluctuations, undergoing changes in local stress distribution and (iii) a final tectonic activation of fault linked to last basinal fluid and hydrocarbon migration during which shear stress restoration on fault plane is faster than fluid pressure build-up.",

            "abstract": "The movement of liquid water in unsaturated snow is a complex and highly heterogeneous process, due to positive feedback mechanisms that lead to distinct flow pathways. A combination of gravitational and capillary forces, combined with small scale spatial variability, causes liquid water to concentrate into sub-meter vertical channels and along stratigraphic boundaries that lead to complicated patterns of volumetric water content. Hydraulic conductivity increases significantly with liquid water content, leading to preferential flow along established pathways. We designed controlled experiments to explore the role of slope-parallel flow of liquid water in unsaturated snow, along layer boundaries, to improve understanding of potential lateral mass redistribution during rapid melt and rain-on-snow events on ice sheets, glaciers and in seasonal snow. We characterized snow structure and monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of liquid water during snowmelt and rain-on-snow events using high-resolution radars, micropenetrometry, near-infrared and time-lapse photography, in-situ dielectric probes, and stable isotopes. We used the seasonal snowpack as a natural laboratory, and collected water outflow with lysimeter arrays designed to quantify the amount of water moving laterally. A co-located full energy-balance weather station provides forcing inputs for modeling, and the degree of lateral flow is also evaluated by monitoring the evolution of soil moisture with a permenantly installed ERT array and multiple dielectric probes in the soil at the base of the snowpack. Improved understanding of liquid water dynamics in unsaturated snow and firn is required for accurate modeling of the percolation zone mass balance on ice sheets and polar glaciers, the timing of wet snow avalanches, and flooding caused by mid-winter rain on seasonal snow.",

In particular, two work packages (geochemical experiments and modelling) hosted at the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) focus on the possible impact of hydrogen on formation fluids and on the mineralogical, geochemical and petrophysical properties of reservoirs and caprocks.\nLaboratory experiments expose core samples from several potential reservoirs to pure hydrogen or hydrogen mixtures under site-specific conditions (temperatures up to 200 °C and pressure up to 300 bar). The resulting qualitative and, whereas possible, quantitative data are expected to ameliorate the precision of predictive geochemical and reactive transport modelling, which is also performed within the project.\nThe combination of experiments and models will improve the knowledge about: (1) solubility model and mixing rule for of hydrogen and its gas mixtures in high saline formation fluids; (2) hydrogen reactivity in a broad spectrum of P-T conditions; (3) thermodynamics and kinetics of mineral dissolution or precipitation reactions and redox processes. It is known that under specific P-T conditions reactions between hydrogen and anorganic rock components such as carbonates can occur. However these conditions have never been precisely defined to date.\nA precise estimation of the hydrogen impact on reservoir behavior of different siliciclastic rock types is crucial for site selection and optimization of storage depth. Enhancing the overall understanding of such systems will benefit the operational reliability, the ecological tolerance, and the economic efficiency of future energy storing plants, crucial aspects for public acceptance and for industrial investors.",

            "abstract": "The presence of mesoscopic heterogeneities, such as fractures, in fluid-saturated porous rocks can produce measurable seismoelectric signals due to wave-induced fluid flow between regions of differing compressibility. Wave-induced fluid flow is a well-known seismic attenuation mechanism, which evidences a strong frequency-dependence that is related to petrophysical and structural properties of the host rock. Therefore, seismoelectric signals arising from this mechanism are expected to depend on the same kind of parameters. However, these remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first propose a numerical approach for computing seismoelectric signals related to the presence of mesoscopic heterogeneities and explore its spectroscopic behavior. To obtain the explicit dependence of the seismoelectric signal on petrophysical and structural parameters, we derive an analytical solution to describe the seismoelectric response of a rock sample containing a horizontal layer at its center that is subjected to an oscillatory compressibility test. We then adapt this general solution to compute the seismoelectric signature of a particular case related to a sample that is permeated by a horizontal fracture. We find that the amplitude of the seismoelectric signal is directly proportional to the applied stress, to the Skempton coefficient contrast between the host rock and the layer, and to a weighted average of the effective excess charge of the two materials. Our results also demonstrate that the frequency at which the maximum electrical potential amplitude prevails is controlled by the permeability and thickness of the less permeable material. The results of this study thus indicate that seismoelectric measurements can potentially be used to estimate key mechanical and hydraulic rock properties, such as compressibility, permeability, and fracture normal compliance.",

Some climate models predict more recurrent climate anomalies in this century, which may alter the functioning of tropical forests with serious structural and demographic implications. The present study aimed to evaluate the profile of tree growth and litterfall production in an eastern Amazon forest, which has suffered recent climatic disturbances. We contrasted different functional groups based on wood density (stem with 0.55; 0.56-0.7; >0.7 g cm-3), light availability (crown illumination index; high illuminated crown - IIC1 until shaded crown – IIC5), and, size class (trees 10-22.5; 22.6-35; 35.1-55; 55,1-90; >90 cm dbh). Tree diameter increment was monthly measured from November 2011 to September 2013 by using dendrometer bands installed on 850 individuals from different families. Litterfall was collected in 64 circular traps, oven dried and weighed, separated into leaves, twigs, reproductive parts and miscellaneous. During the rainy season the sampled trees had the highest rates of tree diametric increment. When analyzing the data by functional groups, large trees had faster growth, but when grouped by wood density, trees with wood density up to 0.55 and between 0.56 and 0.7 g cm-3 had the fastest rates of growth. When grouped by crown illumination index, trees exposed to higher levels of light grew more in comparison to partially shaded trees. Maximum daily air temperature and precipitation were the most important environmental variables in determining the diametric increment profile of the trees. Litterfall production was estimated to be 7.1 Mg ha-1.year-1 and showed a strong seasonal pattern, with dry season production being higher than in the rainy season. Leaves formed the largest fraction of the litterfall, followed by twigs, reproductive parts, and finally miscellaneous. These results show that the profile of tree diametric growth and litterfall production are recorded at close intervals in the preterit analyzes in the same study area and highlights the efficiency of functional groups in determining the tree growth profile.",

This is mainly due to the lack of a large number of datasets and long-term records as summarized in the in the IPCC reports. This paper aims to provide improved knowledge and evidence on current and future climate conditions, for better manage climate variability over seasons and from year to year and strengthen the capacity to adapt to future climate change. In this regards, we analyse the evolution of some extreme temperature and precipitation indices over a large area of West Africa. Prior results show a general warming trend at individual stations throughout the region during the period from 1960 to 2010, namely negative trends in the number of cool nights, and positive trends in the number of warm days and length of warm spells. Trends in rainfall-related indices are not as uniform as the ones in temperatures, rather they display marked multi-decadal variability, as expected. To refine analyses of temperature variations and their relation to precipitation we investigated on cluster analysis aimed at distinguishing different sub-regions, such as continental and coastal, and relevant seasons, such as wet, dry/cold and dry warm. This will contribute to significantly lower uncertainties by developing better and more tailored temperature and precipitation trends to inform the user communities on climate related risks, as well as enhance their resilience to food insecurity and other climate related disasters.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of δ13C of soil CO2 are used to partition the surface flux into autotrophic and heterotrophic components. Models predict that the δ13CO2 of the soil efflux is perturbed by non-steady state (NSS) diffusive conditions. These could be large enough to render δ13CO2 unsuitable for accurate flux partitioning. Field studies sometimes find correlations between efflux δ13CO2 and flux or temperature, or that efflux δ13CO2 is not correlated as expected with biological drivers. We tested whether NSS effects in semi-natural soil were comparable with those predicted. We compared chamber designs and their sensitivity to changes in efflux δ13CO2.\nIn a natural soil mesocosm, we controlled temperature to generate NSS conditions of CO2 production. We measured the δ13C of soil CO2 using in situ probes to sample the subsurface, and dynamic and forced-diffusion chambers to sample the surface efflux. Over eight hours we raised soil temperature by 4.5 OC to increase microbial respiration. Subsurface CO2 concentration doubled, surface efflux became 13C-depleted by 1 ‰ and subsurface CO2 became 13C-enriched by around 2 ‰. Opposite changes occurred when temperature was lowered and CO2 production was decreasing. Different chamber designs had inherent biases but all detected similar changes in efflux δ13CO2, which were comparable to those predicted. Measurements using dynamic chambers were more 13C-enriched than expected, probably due to advection of CO2 into the chamber.\nIn the mesocosm soil, δ13CO2 of both efflux and subsurface was determined by physical processes of CO2 production and diffusion. Steady state conditions are unlikely to prevail in the field, so spot measurements of δ13CO2 and assumptions based on the theoretical 4.4 ‰ diffusive fractionation will not be accurate for estimating source δ13CO2. Continuous measurements could be integrated over a period suitable to reduce the influence of transient NSS conditions. It will be difficult to disentangle biologically driven changes in soil δ13CO2 from physical controls, particularly as they occur on similar timescales and are driven by the same environmental variables, such as temperature, moisture and daylight.",

            "abstract": "As Kīlauea Volcano approaches its 33rd year of nearly continuous activity, simultaneous summit and rift eruptions continue to challenge island populations, agriculture, and infrastructure with elevated levels of acidic gases and particles. In 2008, the opening of a new summit vent attended a ten- to one hundred- fold increase in SO2 summit emissions which, combined with the ongoing east rift emissions, resulted in the highest combined annual SO2 release since regular measurements began in 1979. While the overall emissions have decreased in a step-wise manner since 2008, this large local source still contributes 20-60% of the SO2 emitted by all stationary fuel combustion sources in the U.S., and ~ 7-20% of the estimated time-averaged annual global volcanogenic SO2 contribution.\nResearch on the long-term health and environmental effects of chronic exposure to volcanic pollution is ongoing in Hawai‘i. Public health statistics suggest that incidences of respiratory emergency increased coincident with the onset of the summit eruption. From 2008-2011, Hawaii County received a Disaster Designation by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture due to agricultural losses from the effects of volcanic emissions.\nA multifaceted approach is being used to address the current gas and particle hazards and to mitigate the impacts to affected areas. Multi-agency websites are providing forecast and real-time data regarding acid particle and SO2 gas concentrations to help people minimize their exposures. The short-term concentration data is linked to color-coded health-advisory levels developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Hawaii State Department of Health, with input from the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Questions remain, however, on the appropriateness of the designated advisory levels for protecting chronically exposed populations, and if these tools are sufficiently useful to Hawai‘i residents and visitors. Other mitigation efforts include community-based health interventions, indoor engineering controls, and innovations and relief programs within the agricultural sector.",

            "abstract": "Over the last several decades, an important area in climate change studies has focused on regional weather and climate extreme events because of their large social and economic consequences. In this study, downscaled Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations have been used to examine regional heat-wave extreme events in the continental U.S. over the last 55 years (i.e., 1950 – 2005) and into the future (i.e., 2005 – 2100). Model runs using various emission scenarios have been used to explore how extremes in maximum and minimum temperatures will change in California over the next few decades. Various statistical analyses have been employed to select the most appropriate models to study future heat waves in California. The purpose of the study is twofold: first, to compare different CMIP5 models’ ability to simulate the historical frequency of extreme temperature events in California and second, to investigate the impacts of future heat wave trends in California with different emission scenarios. We believe our study will help to provide useful information and guidance for both policy makers and stakeholders on potential future changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events.",

            "abstract": "Many calcareous organisms are known to record the ambient environmental conditions in which they grow, and their calcium carbonate skeletons are often valuable archives of climate records. Mytilus californianus, a widely distributed species of intertidal mussel, experiences a spatial mosaic of oceanographic conditions as it grows within the California Current System. Periodic episodes of upwelling bring high-CO2 waters to the surface, during which California coastal waters are similar to projected conditions and act as a natural analogue to future ocean acidification. To examine the link between upwelling and shell characteristics of M. californianus, we analyzed the morphology and stable isotope (δ13C, δ18O) signatures of mussel specimens collected live from seven study sites within the California Current System. Morphometric analyses utilized a combination of elliptic Fourier analysis and shell thickness measurements to determine the influence of low pH waters on the growth morphology and ecological fitness of M. californianus. These geochemical and morphological analyses were compared with concurrent high-resolution environmental (T, S, pH, TA, DIC) records from these seven study sites from 2010-2013. With appropriate calibration, new archives from modern M. californianus shells could provide a valuable tool to enable environmental reconstructions within the California Current System. These archives could in turn be used to predict the future consequences of continuing ocean acidification, as well as reconstruct past (archeological) conditions.",

            "abstract": "As the improvements of observing systems, model parameterizations, and advanced assimilation techniques, a few reanalyses data sets become available; however, it is necessary to understand their strengths and biases before exploiting them. In this study, we investigate five contemporary reanalyses (20CR, CFSR, Era-Interim, JRA-25, and MERRA). In detail, we first compared the cloud fraction, TOA radiation fluxes and cloud radiative forcings using CERES MODIS SYN1deg and EBAF products on the global scale. We then analyze the differences and similarities between these parameters in tropical and mid-latitudes under convective and subsidence regimes. It is important to note that CERES MODIS and EBAF results are used as reference to evaluate these simulated parameters, and these data cover the period from 03/2000 to 02/2012. The preliminary results show that most of the reanalyses under estimate cloud fraction on global average, and the SW, LW, and Net CRFs are biased by as much as 3.9 (CFSR), −8.7 (JRA-25), and −5.7 (JRA-25) Wm−2, respectively. Convective and subsidence regimes are identified as the strong ascending and descending branches of the large general circulation in the tropics and mid-latitudes. This metric helps to identify the physical characteristics in specific areas and the types of clouds that reside there. Clouds are typically over estimated in convective areas while in the subsidence region clouds are under estimated. Sensitivity studies show that these regimes exhibit different regressive behaviors when comparing cloud fraction to CRFs, especially in the LW CRF. The error analysis reveals information that can be useful for modelers so that they may develop better parameterizations for clouds and how they interact with incoming solar and outgoing infrared radiation.",

            "abstract": "Floods are a recurring natural hazard responsible for large socioeconomic losses globally. In mid-latitude locations, such as Western North America and Europe, heavy precipitation and floods, are connected to intense water vapor transport in extra-tropical cyclones called atmospheric rivers (ARs). This AR region is narrow (on the order of 300-500 km wide) and transports the majority of the poleward moisture flux. Given the strong link between ARs and floods on the west coast of North America, it is the aim of this research to determine if ARs are responsible for hydrohazards in British Columbia and Alaska.\nUsing satellite measurements, atmospheric reanalyses, and in-situ observations we undertake a hydrometeorological analysis on two major flood events, namely the Bella Coola flood in British Columbia in September 2010 in which 10 inches (250mm) of rain fell in 36 hours, and an Alaskan event that produced over 50 inches (1250 mm) of precipitation in the month of September 2012 (mostly in two landfalling ARs), and led to record river stage heights. Furthermore, the Alaskan event resulted in one fatality and $35M in damages to buildings, homes, and infrastructure.\nPreliminary results suggest that AR conditions were present during these events, and are therefore likely to be important for hydrohazards more generally in British Columbia and Alaska. As the enhanced water vapor transport in the ARs encountered the steep terrain in these regions orographic enhancement of rainfall occurred resulting in record rainfall totals and floods. The occurrence of these events in September (earlier than noteworthy AR events in the U.S. West Coast farther south) may also relate to the earlier nascence of the winter circulation pattern in northern latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) are the most common features of shear wave velocity models of the lowermost mantle. In contrast, the existence of thin layers with strong decrease in P- and S-wave velocity and increase in density - known as ultra low velocity zones (ULVZs) - is still ambiguous at some locations of the core mantle boundary (CMB). Moreover, ULVZ parameters are highly non-unique because of the strong parameter correlations (i.e., trade-offs). The parameter uncertainty estimation is crucial for appropriate physical interpretation. These challenges cannot be addressed using a traditional forward waveform modeling. We thus previously developed a Bayesian inversion to address these difficulties. In a Bayesian inversion, the prior knowledge on the model parameters is combined with the data information described by the likelihood function. Ultimately, the ensemble of solutions is obtained in terms of posterior probability density (solution of the inverse problem). To investigate the unknown parameterization (i.e., the number of layers), we utilized the Bayesian Information Criterion and applied it to study the ULVZ beneath the east of the Philippines [Pachhai et al., 2014, revised]. Here we build on the previous study and develop a trans-dimensional approach in which the number of free parameters (ULVZ layers) is treated as an unknown parameter in the inversion. We confirm that the ULVZ beneath the east of the Philippines is multi-layered, with dense and melt-rich iron material sitting on the bottom. Furthermore, we analyze ScP waves recorded by the Australian arrays that sample the CMB beneath the east of Australia. We examine more than 1000 (Mw>5.0) events and identify 36 events with clear onsets of core-reflected waves (ScP), out of which 9 events also contain clear PcP waves. These data enable us to achieve an unprecedented sampling of a significant area near the edges of the LLSVP under the southwest Pacific Ocean and give insights in fine details of the CMB. We interpret our findings in the context of known ULVZ morphology and our previous findings of different types of ULVZs, and discuss the spatial relationship relative to the Pacific LLSVP.",

            "abstract": "Fault zones are heterogeneities that may greatly influence groundwater flow in crystalline regions. The quantification of fluxes, the origin of water and geochemical processes associated to groundwater flow in such context remain not well understood. This study mainly concerns a large-scale multidisciplinary field experiments performed on a specific site in Brittany (Saint-Brice en Coglès, France) where a permeable fault zone was identified at depth (200 m). The main objectives here are to constrain both fluxes dynamic and water sources involved during different seasonal regimes.\nWe demonstrate that the fault zone allows the discharge of regional groundwater at the watershed outlet. Using specific hydro-geophysical measurements (Heat Pulse Flow Meter), we estimate a natural discharge rate between 150 and 200 m3/d. The fault zone presents different geochemical signatures related to changes in hydrologic regime. They are linked to transient fluxes enhancement from different reservoirs. During the low hydrologic regimes, water with high resident time flows along the fault zone, with a contribution of inter-glacial origin (recharge temperature of 7°C deduced from noble gases interpretation). Water trapped in a low-permeability domain is mobilized to the fault zone and/or large-scale circulation loops are involved. During the high hydrologic regimes, modern water predominantly ensures the recharge of the system at a local scale. Results are compared to regional observations in the Armoricain Massif in order to establish mechanisms responsible for recharge and migration of groundwater at the basement scale.",

In this talk, we will discuss how the big data phenomenon creates an imperative for collaboration among domain scientists (in this case, geoscientists) and computer scientists. Domain scientists provide the application requirements as well as insights about the data involved, while computer scientists help assess whether problems can be solved with currently available technologies or require adaptaion of existing technologies and/or development of new technologies. The synergy can create vibrant collaborations potentially leading to new science insights as well as development of new data technologies and systems.

            "abstract": "The Ediacaran to Cambrian period records one of the most dramatic biological episodes in Earth’s history. The weathering influx from continents is thought to be a major influence on the change in composition of ancient seawater and on biological evolution. Its flux can be constrained from the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of ancient carbonate rocks. However, the scarcity of well-preserved outcrops of Ediacaran rocks still leaves ambiguity in decoding ambient surface environmental changes and biological evolution.\nThe Ediacaran strata in South China are almost continuously exposed, comprise mainly carbonate rocks with subordinate black shales, and contain many fossils. Therefore, they are suitable for study of a link between environmental and biological changes in the Ediacaran. We conducted on-land drilling from Liantuo, via Nantuo, Doushantuo, Dengying and Yanjiahe to Shuijingtuo formations at four sites in the Three Gorges area to obtain continuous, fresh samples. We analyzed radiogenic Sr isotope of the fresh carbonate rocks with a MC-ICP-MS at Kyoto University.\nThe 87Sr/86Sr excursion preserved in the drilled samples displays a smooth curve and three large positive shifts in the Ediacaran. The first large positive excursion occurred together with negative δ13C and positive δ18O excursions. We interpret that global regression due to global cooling enhanced the oxidative decay of exposed marine organic sediments and continental weathering.\nThe second large positive shift of 87Sr/86Sr firstly accompanied a positive δ13C excursion, and continued through the Shuram negative δ13C excursion. The higher 87Sr/86Sr values are the first compelling evidence for enhanced continental weathering in the Ediacaran, which was responsible for the large δ13C anomaly through the re-mineralization of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir by more active sulfate reduction due to a higher sulfate influx.\nThe 87Sr/86Sr ratios display a large positive anomaly just below the PC/C boundary at the lower part of Yanjiahe Formation. The data indicates that the 87Sr/86Sr excursions preceded the δ13C negative excursion, and suggests that global regression or locally high continental weathering influx caused the re-mineralization of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir at the beginning of the Cambrian.",

The total area of degraded forest and the effects of degradation on the reduction of forest aboveground biomass are probably less than for deforestation but no one knows how much less. I contrast case studies for four assessments of forest degradation area based on remote sensing data in the Brazilian Amazon and explain differences in the current assessments based on the process focus, temporal mismatches, the spatial scale of the analysis, and threshold effects.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic activity generates topography, and the variability of tectonic forcing is responsible for topographic patterns and variability of relief in fluvial landscapes. Despite this basic relation, the inverse problem, by which features of the topography are used for inferring tectonic uplift rates, has proven challenging. In the current work, we develop formal linear inversion schemes to infer a record of the rate of relative uplift as a function of space and time from the long profiles of rivers. The relative uplift rate is the difference between the rates of rock uplift and of the base level change. The inversion schemes are based on a closed-form analytic solution to the transient linear stream power model, and to increase model resolution they make use of the multiplicity of information made available by multiple rivers and their tributaries. The distribution of the fluvial response time to tectonic perturbations is a key component of the inversion scheme, as this determines which tectonic events are preserved in the topography. We develop two inversion parameterizations that differ in their assumptions about the tectonic forcing: space-invariant and time-space variability with an assumed spatial distribution.\nWe apply the inversion schemes to the Inyo Mountains, an uplifted block along the western boundary of the Basin and Range Province in California. Inversion results indicate that the range has been experiencing an acceleration of the relative uplift in the past ~2-3 Myr. We further use the inversion results to constrain the paleotopography and paleo-erosion rate along the range and to recover the throw rate history along the fault that bounds the Inyo range.",

A USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change (NASC) study documents coastal change rates at 50 meter intervals along about 1300 km of coast distributed between the Canadian Border and Icy Cape, almost entirely within the ShoreZone study area.\nDescriptive ShoreZone data provides a framework for better understanding coastal environments and their importance to change rates. We are applying a new method for clustering and comparing ShoreZone units to generate subsets of NASC coastal change rates with similar coastal morphology, and mapping areas outside the NASC study that show similarity to areas with documented high rates of erosion or accretion. Joint analysis of these two datasets provides insight into the processes that control coastal change, and a starting point for understanding how climate change is transforming Arctic coasts.",

            "abstract": "Very high-resolution (VHR) imagery can in principle measure surface topography with decimetric precision. The question is how well 3D mapping based on VHR stereo imagery is capable of capturing sub-metric height changes occurring in an earthquake, particularly those in remote areas? The aim of this study is to assess the capability of the Pleiades satellites to determine such height changes.\nWe acquired Pleiades stereo imagery with backward (B), near-nadir (N) and forward (F) orientations over a 40 km × 5 km area in Baja California, Mexico, part of the epicentral area of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor–Cucapah earthquake. Coverage was chosen to coincide with the post-seismic LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM) for the area. DEMs have been produced with four different combinations of incidence angles (B-N, N-F, B-F and B-N-F). The raw point cloud has the lowest average density of ~0.7 points/m2 for B-F, ~1.0 points/m2 for B-N and N-F, and the greatest average density of ~3 points/m2 for tri-stereo (B-N-F). Compared to the post-earthquake LiDAR DEM, the Pleiades DEMs have a mean error of 1 m to 4 m, with a standard deviation of 0.5 m to 0.7 m.\nA series of topographic profiles from the Pleiades DEMs across the earthquake rupture were used to measure vertical offsets. These profiles show that the Pleiades DEM is capable of capturing vertical offsets of ~0.5 m. The measurements of vertical offsets from tri-stereo have smaller uncertainties than bi-stereo; this suggests that the tri-stereo DEM incorporating redundant observations is more robust and reliable. By differencing the 1-m tri-stereo Pleiades DEM and the pre-earthquake, lower-resolution (5-m) LiDAR DEM, we mapped metre and sub-metre offsets along the faults obtaining results comparable to a previous study that differenced the two LiDAR DEMs (Fig. 1). By extension, we expect it to be possible in similar settings to measure sub-metre vertical offsets occurring in earthquakes using pre- and post-event Pleiades stereo imagery.",

            "abstract": "Curiosity rover landed at Gale, an early Hesperian age crater formed within Noachian rocks. In Hummocky plain, more than half of the igneous floats rocks are highly alkaline rocks (Stolper et al. doi: 101126/science.12239463, Schmidt et al. doi: 10.1002/2013JE004481) and feldspar-bearing rocks (Sautter et al. doi: 10.1002/2013JE00447). ChemCam observations at sub-millimeter scale show that these samples contain a significant feldspar component, either associated with LCP in gabbroic texture or with augite in effusive rocks defining an alkaline K-feldspar-bearing suite: basanite, trachy-andesite with porphyritic texture and syenitic rock with apahnitic texture. This series likely resulted from differentiation of liquids produced by low degrees of partial melting of primitive mantle. These rocks are float rocks or occurred as clast in conglomerate suggesting a provenance from Gale crater rim. NWA 7533 is the first Noachian breccia sampling the southern hemisphere Martian regolith. It is a polymict breccia with leucocratic clasts including zircon with 4.4 Ga ages Humayun et al., doi :10.1038/nature). The alkali basaltic evolved clasts contain two feldspars (alkali and plagioclase) and modal recombination gives a basaltic trachy-andesite, gabbroic, trachy-andesite and mugearite clast (Agee et al. doi: 10.1126/science. 1228858). Noritic clasts contain andesine, LCP, and Cr-magnetite. The monzonitic/mugearitic-evolved clasts are composed of alkali feldspar, plagioclase, augite, Ti-Magnetite, Cl-apatite and zircon. These clasts would represent products of Martian crust emplaced at 4.5 Ga and re-melted at 4.4 Ga (Humayun et al., doi :10.1038/nature). The leucocratic clasts of the Noachian SNC breccia will be compared with evolved lithology encountered at Gale crater and products of Noachian magmatism will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Aptian–Albian (~125–100 Ma, Early Cretaceous) is considered to be an interval of elevated greenhouse gases, intensified hydrologic cycle, limited polar ice, and elevated high latitude temperatures, with evidence for Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAE) as recorded by organic matter and carbonate δ13C perturbations in both the marine and continental realm (Jenkyns et al., 2004; Poulsen, 2004; Robinson & Hesselbo, 2004 and Ufnar et al., 2004). In this study four cores from Aptian­–Albian marine sediments from a single offshore basin in Abu Dhabi, UAE were examined petrographically and samples were collected to generate a high resolution organic carbon δ13C chemostratigraphic profile. The cores represent sediments from the Early Cretaceous upper most Thamama and lowermost Wasia Group and represent interbedded shale and limestone units from the Arabian Shelf. Three of the cores, cores A­–C, show a 3‰ negative excursion in δ13Corg with values of -28‰ occurring with a concurrent increase in organic carbon, likely indicative of Aptian OAE 1a. These cores also show a transition from more oxic to euxinic waters as recorded in the pyrite framboid mean diameter. The remaining core, D, shows relatively isotopically light average δ13Corg values of -26‰, with an intervening positive isotope excursion and values of -23‰, and may represent a different event either earlier or later in the sequence, but due to limited biostratigraphic data could not easily be correlated using C-Isotopes alone with the other three cores. The four cores come from different localities within a single basin and highlight issues pertaining to correlating cores across a single basin for the same time interval, as well as variability in organic matter burial and oxygenation within a single basin, and may provide a useful case study specifically related to separating regional signals from global carbon isotope signals for the Aptian–Albian, and understanding how ancient Mesozoic basins are affected by global marine transgression and changes in ocean oxygenation specifically during OAE1a.",

            "abstract": "Considerable amounts of atmospheric CO2 are incorporated in plant belowground biomass and thus contribute to soil OM. However, associated with rooting, microorganisms enter the soil and, due to priming effects, might improve C mineralisation. Although these processes are well known for recent topsoils, it remains unclear if and how microorganisms contribute to long-term C dynamics in the subsoil and underlying soil parent material.\nThis study comprises several state-of-the-art techniques like bacterial DNA and lipid molecular proxies to trace living and fossil microbial biomass in modern and ancient root systems. Throughout a 13 m thick loess-paleosol sequence in SW Germany, which has been penetrated by several generations of roots since the last glacial maximum, both bulk (Corg and Ccarb) and molecular changes in the rhizosphere were assessed at different depth intervals.\nPhospholipid fatty acids, DNA and intact polar glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers argue for the presence of living microorganisms in the rhizosphere not only of living but also ancient (≥3 ky) roots, which is associated with long-term C dynamics after the lifetime of the root. In the surrounding of living and ancient roots either C enrichment or C depletion was determined, depending on depth and rooting intensity. Especially in areas with high root densities (up to 20.000 root features like biopores, recent and calcified roots m-2), rhizomicrobial degradation led to decrease of C contents. In depth intervals of lower root feature densities (<<100 m-2), C accumulation was observed in the rhizosphere and rhizomicrobial degradation was limited.\nThe penetration of subsoil and underlying sediment by roots does not necessarily lead to additional C stabilization in the long-term, despite locally abundant root features and high portions of incorporated root- and rhizomicrobial-derived OM on a molecular level. At the contrary, priming effects may lead to considerable C loss in densely rooted sediment.",

            "abstract": "Water is efficiently recycled at subduction zones. It is fluxed from the surface into the mantle by the subducted plate and back to the surface or crust through explosive arc volcanism and degassing. Fluids released from dehydrating the subducting plate are transfer agents of water. Geophysical modeling [\n1\n] and the geochemistry of arc glasses [\n2\n] suggest that at cold-slab subduction zones, such as the Mariana convergent margin, the downgoing plate mostly dehydrates beneath the volcanic arc front (≥ ~ 80 -100 km depth to slab) to trigger volcanism. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the water fluxes released beneath forearcs, as examples of forearc magmatism are extremely rare. Here, we investigate the Southernmost Mariana Forearc Rift (SEMFR), where MORB-like spreading occurred unusually close to the trench, sampling slab-derived aqueous fluids released at ~ 30 to 100 km depth from the subducted plate. Examining the trace element and water contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions and glassy rinds from the young (2 - 4 Ma) and fresh SEMFR pillowed basalts provide new insights into the global water cycle. SEMFR lavas contain ~2 wt % H2O, and the olivine-hosted melt inclusions have the highest subduction-related H2O/Ce ratios (H2O/Ce = 6000 - 19000) ever recorded in arc magmas (H2O/Ce < 10600 and global averaged H2O/Ce < 3000). Our findings show that (i) slab-derived fluids released beneath forearcs are water-rich compared to the deeper fluids released beneath the arc system; and (ii) cold downgoing plates lose most of their water at shallow depths (~ 70 - 80 km slab depth), suggesting that water is efficiently recycled beneath the forearc (≥ 90%).\n1.

Continuous ground measurements were taken at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO) including non-refractory (NR) PM1 size-resolved chemical composition using a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS), aerosol light scattering using a Nephelometer, and gas-phase CO, CO2, O3, NOx, and NOy measurements. A similarly equipped sampling platform was launched aboard the Gulfstream-1 (G-1) aircraft which flew near wildfires to probe near-source emissions. Sixteen well-defined fire plumes observed at MBO were selected for detailed analysis and calculation of the modified combustion efficiency (MCE), a quantitative measure of burning conditions. The analyses include calculation of enhancement ratios relative to CO and CO2, elemental ratios of organic aerosols, and back-trajectory analysis for approximate plume age and fire source location. Strong trends were observed when comparing dilution corrected aerosol parameters vs MCE for all plumes identified. Organic PM, scattering and particle-phase inorganic nitrate enhancements displayed a negative correlation with increasing MCE. Various plumes from the G1 data set were analyzed using the same criteria and consistencies were found. We will explore the potential role that burning conditions have on wildfire emissions and how these may be used for better modeling and more accurate emissions inventories.",

Here we present the results of a comprehensive study to reproduce an accurate simulated lunar environment, evaluate the most appropriate sample and measurement conditions, collect thermal infrared spectra of a representative suite of Apollo soils, and correlate them with Diviner observations of the lunar surface.\nIt has been established that thermal infrared spectra measured in a simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial conditions. The data presented here were collected at the University of Oxford Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC). In SLEC, the lunar environment is simulated by: (1) pumping the chamber to vacuum pressures (<10-4 mbar) sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling the chamber with liquid nitrogen to simulate radiation to the cold space environment, and (3) heating the samples with heaters and lamp to set-up thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface. A comprehensive suite of experiments were conducted using different sample preparation and heating conditions on Apollo soils 15071 (maria) and 67701 (highland) and compared the results to Diviner noontime data to select the optimal experimental conditions. Additional thermal infrared measurements in optimized SLE were made of 10084 (A11 – LM), 12001 (A12 – LM), 14259 (A14 – LM), 15071 (A15 – S1), 15601 (A15 – S9a), 61141 (A16 – S1), 66031 (A16 – S6), 67701 (A16 – S11), and 70181 (A17 – LM).\n\nThe Diviner dataset includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution. We find that analyses of Diviner observations of individual sampling stations and SLE measurements of returned Apollo soils show good agreement, while comparisons to thermal infrared reflectance under terrestrial conditions do not agree well, which underscores the need for SLE measurements and validates the Diviner compositional dataset.",

            "abstract": "SourceURL:file://localhost/Users/socquet/Auboulot/congres/socquetAGU2014.doc\nThe subduction zone at the latitude of the Central Andes did not experience a Mw>8.5 earthquake since the 19thcentury, and forms a ~500km long seismic gap in North Chile - South Peru.\nUnderstanding the factors that limit the extent of seismic ruptures is crucial for risk mitigation and for understanding physical processes that govern the behavior of seismogenic faults. It appears crucial to evaluate interseismic coupling and its spatial variation in seismic gaps to assess seismic potential.\nRecent geodetic studies combining continuous and campaign GPS measurements as well as InSAR measurements showed that the subduction interface in north Chile, was accumulating interseismic elastic strain, likely to rebound into a large megathrust Earthquake.\nA Mw8.2 earthquake occurred on the 1st of April 2014 in this seismic gap, in front of Pisagua (North Chile), ~150 km south of the Chile-Peru Border. In spite of its already large magnitude, that earthquake was smaller expected in the area, and has most probably increased the stress in the unbroken segments at both edges. Most of accumulated strain remains to be relaxed in the North Chile-South Peru seismic gap. Here we propose to present a first assessment of the interseismic loading in the South Peru part of the seismic gap, at the northern extremity of Pisagua Earthquake, where it is poorly known.\nIn south Peru, over an area of 500 x 250 km, 33 campaign markers have been installed and measured in June 2012. This network has been partially remeasured in June 2013 and April 2014 (after Mw8.2 Pisagua Eaquake). These measurements provide us with an estimate of the Pre-Pisagua-Earthquake coupling, and the co-seismic static displacements. These displacements are combined together with the ones of previous studies that occurred in North Chile and provide a unique and dense velocity field spreading through the Chile Peru border. In particular this provides a unique assessment on the pre-earthquake interseismic coupling at the latitude of the Arica bend, often described as a seismic barrier, and therefore expected to slip aseismically. Results of the GPS derived interseismic segmentation are compared with the seimicity and geomorphic features in the area.",

            "abstract": "Quartz is a common crustal mineral that deforms plastically in a wide range of temperatures and pressures, leading to the development of different types of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) patterns. In this contribution we present the results of an extensive modelling of quartz fabric transitions via visco-plastic self- consistent (VPSC) approach. For that, we have performed systematic simulations using different sets of relative critical resolved shear stress of the main quartz slip systems. We have performed these simulations in axial compression and simple shear regimes under constant Von Mises equivalent strain of 100% (γ=1.73), assuming that the aggregates deformed exclusively by dislocation glide. Some of the predicted CPOs patterns are similar to those observed in naturally and experimentally deformed quartz. Nevertheless, some classical CPO patterns usually interpreted as resulting from dislocation glide (e.g. Y-maxima due to prism <a> slip) are clearly not developed in the simulated conditions. In addition we report potentially new preferred orientation patterns that might develop in high temperature conditions, both in axial compression and simple shear. We have demonstrated that CPOs generated under axial compression are usually stronger that those predicted under simple shear, due to the continuous rotation observed in the later simulations. The fabric strength depends essentially on the dominant active slip system, and normally the stronger CPOs result from dominant basal slip in <a>, followed by rhomb <a> and prism [c] slip, whereas prism <a> slip does not produce strong fabrics. The opening angle of quartz [0001] fabric used as a proxy of temperature seems to be reliable for deformation temperatures of ~400°C, when the main slip systems have similar behaviours.",

            "abstract": "Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 is one of the main rock-forming minerals of the Earth crust and is often used as a model compound of the whole silicate part of our planet. In equilibrium conditions in the Earth interior olivine undergoes a series of phase transitions and further breaks into ferropericlase and bridgmanite phases at about 25 GPa. All these transitions are responsible for major seismic discontinuities in the Earth. However, if olivine in compressed at temperature that is too low to overcome kinetic barrier, it preserves its original structureuntil ~35 GPa and then gradually becomes amorphous. This transformation have been observed before by mean of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, but very little is known about the amorphisation mechanism and the local structure of (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 glass under high pressure.\nWe performed a combined XANES and Raman spectroscopic study of a pressure-induced amorphisation is natural olivine sample (Mg0.92Fe0.08)2SiO4 from San Carlos location. Despite the fact that this natural sample has very low iron concentration and therefore absorption jump was quite small (about 0.06), a decent quality XANES spectra were recorded in transmission mode on the energy-dispercive beamline ID24 at the ESRF usind a diamond anvil cell technique.\nThe amorphisation process can be clearly seen in Raman spectra as a significant broadening and further disappearance of the Raman peaks starting from 35-40 GPa, in perfect agreement with the previous literature data. The most interesting result is a dramatic change of the near-edge structure of X-ray absorption spectra. Since XAS is sensitive to the local structure only, one would not expect significant changes in spectra (apart for some broadening) if only long-range order in the material is lost. Our experimental results indicate that pressure-induced amorphisation in olivine is accomplished with a significant variation of the local atomic structure around Fe cation, probably forming effective coordination number similar to the bridgmanite rather than a 6-fold coordination typical for low-pressure phases.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, projection systems in most planetariums, traditional sites of outreach and education, have advanced from interfaces that can display the motion of stars as moving beam spots to systems that are able to visualize multicolor, high-resolution, immersive full-dome videos or images. These extraordinary capabilities are ideally suited for visualization of global processes occurring on the surface and within the interior of the Earth, a spherical body just as the full dome. So far, however, our community has largely ignored this wonderful interface for outreach and education, and any previous geo-shows have mostly been limited to cartoon-style animations. Thus, we here propose a framework to convey recent scientific results on the origin and evolution of our PLANET to the >100 million per-year worldwide audience of planetariums, making the traditionally astronomy-focussed interface a true PLANETarium. In order to do this most efficiently, we intend to show „inside-out“ visualizations of scientific datasets and models, as if the audience was positioned in the Earth’s inner core. Such visualizations are expected to be renderable to the dome with little or no effort. For example, showing global geophysical datasets (e.g., gravity, air temperature), or horizontal slices of seismic-tomography images and spherical computer models requires no rendering at all. Rendering of 3D Cartesian datasets or models may further be achieved using standard techiques. Here, we show several example pilot animations. These animations rendered for the full dome are projected back to 2D for visualization on a flatscreen. Present-day science visualizations are typically as intuitive as cartoon-style animations, yet more appealing visually, and clearly with a higher level of detail. In addition to e.g. climate change and natural hazards, themes for any future geo-shows may include the coupled evolution of the Earth’s interior and life, from the accretion of our planet to the evolution of mantle convection as well as the sustainment of a magnetic field and habitable conditions. We believe that high-quality tax-funded science visualizations should not exclusively be used for communication among scientists, but also recycled to raise the public’s awareness and appreciation of the geosciences.",

            "abstract": "Some atmospheric chemical processes are influenced by the presence of convection and/or lightning. Therefore, it is often important to determine whether a sampled air parcel previously has encountered these influences. This paper describes procedures for making these determinations and provides uncertainties associated with the procedures. Prior locations of the sampled air are obtained by calculating backward trajectories based on 1 h WRF output with 3 domains (horizontal grid spacing of 36, 12, and 4 km). Back trajectories are released along every DC-8 flight track from the recent NASA SEAC4RS campaign (~22,000 trajectories total). If lightning influence is sought, locations of the flashes usually are obtained from ground-based networks such as the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Results show that the user-defined spatial and temporal separation between a trajectory and the flash location greatly influences whether the trajectory is considered lightning influenced. For example, a spatial threshold of 0.5 (0.25) deg lat/lon leads to 69% (60%) of the trajectories being lightning influenced. If model-derived convective influence is sought, a vertical displacement threshold corresponding to w≥1 m s-1 is used to identify convectively influenced parcels. Remarkably, the model-derived method using the 4 km WRF output leads to only 5% (compared to ~60% from lightning) of the trajectories being convectively influenced. Additionally, the horizontal grid spacing (36 km vs. 4 km) exerts a major influence on the paths of the trajectories. The overriding conclusion is that very different results are obtained depending on whether simulated convectively influenced or lightning influenced air is being sought. Also, once this choice is made, the resolution of the model and the time/space thresholds that are chosen will have a major impact on the number of trajectories that are determined to be influenced. This paper will provide guidance on these choices.",

            "abstract": "Projections for Earth’s future suggest that wildfire activity will increase with global warming, but the factors controlling fire are complex. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a geologically abrupt global warming event that had profound effects on vegetation and hydrologic patterns and serves as an analog for modern climate change. Carbon burn-down (i.e., oxidation of organic matter) could amplify feedbacks with warming through release of carbon to the atmosphere. To assess relationships between climate, fire and soil respiration, we evaluated biomarkers, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), charcoal and total organic carbon (TOC) for three paleo-floodplain depositional sites in the Western USA. Samples were selected from Bighorn Basin Coring Project cores in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (at Basin Substation and Polecat Bench) and from an outcrop section in the Piceance Basin, Colorado.\nIn general, the Paleocene had higher PAH concentrations (μg/g TOC) than the Eocene, but there was no clear trend during the onset (~20 kyr) or through the PETM (~200 kyr). Median %TOC decreased through the PETM, then increased in the Eocene, but did not return to Paleocene values. At Basin Substation, PAH concentrations decreased by an order of magnitude during the PETM interval, concurrent with a decline in TOC and charcoal. High molecular weight (MW) PAHs tend to dominate, especially in low TOC samples; this suggests preferential loss of low MW PAHs, which are relatively more susceptible to post-depositional processes. Lithology, TOC and the relative proportion of PAHs help discern the signals of carbon oxidation, by fire and by soil respiration.\nDespite climate conditions that tend to promote fire, there is no evidence for increased fires at the onset or throughout the PETM. Biomarker and petrographic data suggest decreased organic carbon preservation, including loss of refractory carbon, at Basin Substation during the PETM. This suggests soil carbon loss, possibly due to higher rates of organic matter decay associated with a hotter and more seasonal climate during the PETM. We propose that higher carbon burn-down, due to accelerated decay rates, outpaced terrestrial productivity during the hyperthermal event, which hindered soil carbon sequestration and enhanced the atmospheric greenhouse.",

These co-located datasets characterize the broad-scale geologic framework of the central offshore Delmarva Peninsula, and also provide the geologic underpinnings to National Ocean Service (NOS) hydrographic bathymetry and previously unpublished acoustic backscatter data collected in the region between 2007 and 2011. The combined datasets extend 100 km along the coast from approximately the 8-m isobath to 30 km offshore in water depths up to ~ 30 m. They provide unprecedented resolution and spatial coverage of an inner continental shelf environment along the U.S. eastern seaboard. Analyses of these high-resolution datasets will improve understanding of inner continental shelf features and processes including: shoal massif origins, sand-ridge development, barrier-island system migration, shallow natural gas occurrence and distribution, paleochannel evolution, regional sea-level history and the role of antecedent geology in the central Delmarva coastal system. In addition to scientific insights, these data provide the foundation for a variety of management applications, such as sand resource, habitat, and coastal vulnerability assessments.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we investigate inter-seasonal and annual co-variations of rainfall and flood levels with Caboclo production portfolios, and proportions of it they sell and consume, in the Amazon Estuary from August 2012 to August 2014. Caboclos of the estuary maintain a diverse and flexible land-use portfolio, with a shift in dominant use from agriculture to agroforestry and forestry since WWII (Vogt et al., 2014). The current landscape is configured for acai, shrimp and fish production. In the last decade the frequency of wet seasons with anomalous flood levels and duration has increased primarily from changes in rainfall and discharge from upstream basins. Local rainfall, though with less influence on extreme estuarine flood levels, is reported to be more sporadic and intense in wet season and variable in both wet and dry seasons, for yet unknown reasons. The current production portfolio and its flexibility are felt to build resilience to these increases in hydro-climatic variability and extreme events. What is less understood, for time and costliness of daily measures at household levels, is how variations in flood and rainfall levels affect shifts in the current production portfolio of estuarine Caboclos, and the proportions of it they sell and consume. This is needed to identify what local hydro-climatic thresholds are extreme for current livelihoods, that is, that most adversely affect food security and income levels. It is also needed identify the large-scale forcings driving those extreme conditions to build forecasts for when they will occur. Here we present results of production, rainfall and flood data collected daily in households from both the North and South Channel of the Amazon estuary over last two years to identify how they co-vary, and robustness of current production portfolio under different hydro-climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Global increase of methane that started in 2007-2008 after a decade of stability requires investigation and explanation. Recent Arctic warming has stimulated speculation about dissociation of Arctic Ocean methane hydrates providing a potentially important new climatic positive feedback. Satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data do not require sunlight, providing key advantages for Arctic data collection compared to shortwave infrared spectroscopy. The US Atmospheric IR Sounder (AIRS) has been delivering CH4 tropospheric data since 2002; NOAA CH4 retrievals from the European Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) radiation data are available since 2008 and analyzed here since 2009. Accuracy of TIR satellite retrievals, especially for the lower troposphere, diminishes for a cold, underlying surface. In this analysis the dependence is parameterized using the Thermal Contrast (a difference between surface temperature and air temperature at the altitude of 4 km, defined THC). A correction function was applied to CH4 data based on a data-derived relationship between THC and retrieved CH4 for areas with positive THC (in other words, without temperature inversions). The seasonal cycles of the adjusted low tropospheric data are in agreement with the surface in situ measurements. Instantaneous IASI retrievals exhibit less variability than AIRS v6 data. Maximum positive deviation of methane concentration measured by IASI for the study period was found for Baffin Bay in November-December, 2013 (Figure). It was concluded that the methane anomaly could indicate both coastal and off-shore emissions. Off-shore data were spatially consistent with a hydrate dissociation mechanisms, active for water depths below the hydrate stability zone top at ~300 m. These are hypothesized to dissociate during seasonal temperature maximum in the bottom layer of the ocean, which occurs in fall. IASI data may be considered as a reliable source of information about Arctic CH4 for conditions of sufficiently high atmospheric vertical thermal contrast. Figure caption. Standard adjusted NOAA/IASI retrievals of 0-4 km mean methane concentration over areas with positive THC. Black points are for the entire Baffin Bay, red points are for locations with seawater depth below 300 m. Blue line is the all-Arctic mean.",

            "abstract": "Diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton class in coastal upwelling systems, accounting for a large proportion of global primary production. Their frustules preserved in sediments are powerful paleoceanographic and paleoproductivity proxies. However, despite high diatom abundance in the water column, they are frequently affected by dissolution and their sedimentary record is discontinuous. A more robust reconstruction independent of preservation characteristics in the sediments would thus be desirable. Lipid biomarkers have a specific structure that might remain intact in the sediments and may be better preserved under conditions corrosive to diatom frustules. This research aims to investigate the organic imprint of upwelling-related diatom species, which may allow the reconstruction of past primary productivity in areas where diatoms are not preserved in the sediments.\nTo better understand the preservation and chemical signature of diatoms in the sedimentary record, we are studying diatom abundance, assemblages and lipid biomarkers in samples from the water column, sediment traps, surface sediments and diatom cultures recovered at the Iberian Margin. This study aims 1) to understand the present-day seasonal abundance and diversity of diatoms, their relation to the hydrographic conditions, along with their transfer/preservation pathways into the sediments; 2) to identify the major groups of lipid biomarkers related with upwelling diatom species in this area.\nDiatom abundances and assemblages observed in the water column and sediment traps evidence seasonal primary productivity. Sediment traps and surface sediment samples are dominated by Leptocylindrus spp. and Chaetoceros spp. resting spores, suggesting these genera as productivity tracers.\nPreliminary results of the biomarkers study show that sterols, known to be one of the major groups of biomarkers related to diatoms, occur in different composition and concentration in the analyzed diatom cultures, water column and sediment trap samples. Others known diatom related lipid biomarkers, namely highly branched isoprenoids and long - chain diols, are also being investigated.",

            "abstract": "Although marine environments contribute approximately 30% of the global atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) flux, coastal systems appear to comprise a disproportionately large majority of the ocean-atmosphere flux. However, there exists a wide range of estimates and future projections of N2O production and emission are confounded by spatial and temporal variability of biological sources and sinks. As N2O is produced as an intermediate in both oxidative and reductive microbial processes and can also be consumed as an electron acceptor, a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of these pathways remains poorly understood. To improve our understanding of N2O dynamics in coastal sediments, we conducted a series of intact flow-through sediment core incubations (Sylt, Germany), while manipulating both the O2 and NO3- concentrations in the overlying water. Steady-state natural abundance isotope fluxes (δ15N and δ18O) of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and nitrous oxide were monitored throughout the experiments. We also measured both the isotopomer composition (site preference (SP) of the 15N in N2O) as well as the Δ17O composition in experiments conducted with the addition of NO3- with an elevated Δ17O composition (19.5‰), which provide complementary information about the processes producing and consuming N2O.\nResults indicate positive N2O fluxes (to the water column) across all conditions and sediment types. Decreasing dissolved O2 to 30% saturation resulted in reduced N2O fluxes (5.9 ± 6.5 μmol m2 d-1) compared to controls (17.8 ± 6.5 μmol m-2 d-1), while the addition of 100 μM NO3- yielded higher N2O fluxes (49.0 ± 18.5 μmol m-2 d-1). In all NO3- addition experiments, the Δ17O signal from the NO3- was clearly observed in the N2O efflux implicating denitrification as a large source of N2O. However, Δ17O values were always lower (1.9 to 8.6‰) than the starting NO3- indicating an important role for nitrification-based N2O production and/or O isotope exchange with water in influencing the O isotope composition of N2O from the sediment-water interface. A steady-state multi-isotope flux model will help to constraining rates and isotope effects of these processes and improve our understanding of the dynamics and pathways of N2O production and emission under varying scenarios of environmental change.",

Each year the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Fleet supports a broad spectrum of research operations and their associated logistics support requirements. Operations can vary from single Principle Investigator (PI) cruises to multi-investigators field programs with multi-disciplinary research objectives in locations all over the world.\nOver the past decade, the process for access to the sea has evolved and continues to be refined through the critical feedback of scientists, marine technicians, and ship operators.\nUnder UNOLS guidance, key guidelines have been identified for all phases of cruise planning; from pre-award to post-expedition to help ensure that the research objectives of programs can be met and that optimal use of our Nation’s oceanographic facilities is maintained.\nAn expeditionary roadmap has been created that captures the major milestones essential to executing a research cruise. The roadmap has been introduced during early career scientist workshops and also during the Chief Scientist Training Cruise programs of recent years. It is a useful planning tool not only for early career scientists and new ship users, but also for experienced sea-going scientists. The roadmap will soon be available as a resource tool on the new UNOLS website. This poster will feature the roadmap for expeditionary planning and offer key information about requirements and tips for a successful, safe, research cruise experience. In addition, existing and new requirements associated with custom clearances, export licensing requirements and additional planning considerations also needed when the research requires special facilities such as aircraft or deep submergence vehicles will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We use multitemporal multiscale satellite remote sensing to complement field observations and subsurface measurements to better understand the relationship between recent and historic fluvial dynamics on the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta. To provide regional context for the interannual changes in river channel geometry we conduct spatiotemporal (ST) analyses of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery for 2000-2013 using a new method of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. We use EVI because it distinguishes water from wet and dry sediment on the basis of the spectral slope at VNIR wavelengths. Water has a negative slope while dry sediment has a small positive slope and vegetation has a large positive slope. To characterize the ST patterns associated with river channel migration we use iterative EOF analysis (iEOF). In iEOF we first conduct a single year EOF analysis for each year in the time series to identify the primary spatial principal component (PC1) for each year and separate this from the spatial structure of the subannual temporal patterns associated with vegetation phenology. We then construct a decadal time series of PC 1 for each single year and conduct a second EOF analysis of the time series of 13 individual year PCs. The standard EOFs of the full (312 images x 16 day) time series only resolve a decadal trend (EOF 8), but the iEOF clearly distinguishs the progressive decadal trend (EOF 2) from the cyclic component (EOF 3) of decadal changes in sediment reflectance. The temporal feature space constructed from PC 2 and PC 3 (corresponding to temporal EOFs 2 and 3) distinguishes pixels with progressive decadal increases and decreases in reflectance from pixels with cyclic changes. Evolution of the annual structure is animated at\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=UM1UYvdnYXk\nDespite significant differences in the 2 rivers’morphologies, and the considerable magnitude of flooding every year, we observe year-to-year continuity in the progressive downstream migration of the larger meanders on both rivers. We also observe a pronounced change in the morphology and evolution of the channels in the Brahmaputra braid plain upstream and downstream of the hinge zone with more rapid changes in channel geometry upstream and a more stable configuration of two anastamosing primary channels downstream.",

            "abstract": "An important source of model uncertainty in climate models arises from unconfined model parameters in physical parameterizations. These parameters are commonly estimated on the basis of manual adjustments (expert tuning), which carries the risk of over-tuning the parameters for a specific climate region or time period. This issue is particularly germane in the case of regional climate models (RCM), which are often developed and used in one or a few geographical regions only. Here we address the role of objective parameter calibration in this context. Using a previously developed objective calibration methodology, we calibrate an RCM over two regions (Europe and North America) and investigate the transferability of the results. A total of eight different model parameters are calibrated, using a metamodel to account for parameter interactions. We demonstrate that the calibration is effective in reducing model biases in both domains. For Europe, this concerns in particular a pronounced reduction of the summer warm bias and the associated overestimation of interannual temperature variability, that has persisted previous expert tuning efforts and that is common in many global and regional climate models. The key process responsible behind this improvement is an increased hydrological conductivity. Over North America, there is also some reduction of the summer warm bias, but in addition the calibration achieves a pronounced reduction of winter biases in interannual temperature variability. We also find that the calibrated parameter values are almost identical for both domains, i.e. the parameter calibration is transferable between the two regions. This is a promising result and indicates that models may be more universal than previously considered.",

            "abstract": "Environmental impacts from industrialized agriculture have been studied extensively over the past two decades. Degradation of surface water occurs, primarily as a result of nutrient loading, causing algal blooms in streams and lakes. Discovery of the toxin microcystin in Lake Erie, a drinking water source for some municipalities, has been associated with agricultural runoff and created a new awareness in the general public. This study used data gathered over ten years by local residents, high school students and undergraduates on surface water around the Lower Peninsula of Michigan to test a simple correlation of nutrients (soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrogen ammonia) along with the presence of specific antibiotics and antibiotic resistance to identify dominant sources of nutrient loading in the Lake Huron Watershed. Data gathering came from multiple sources and were processed by faculty and students at an undergraduate, liberal arts institution. College students from various disciplines worked with community members and municipalities in an effort to describe the problem. Students proposed solutions which by-passed relatively inactive regulatory agencies to create an integrative, interactive resolution that involved a surprisingly wide extent of the community. Addressing cultural norms beginning with those most affected by a degraded environment has reaped some success in changing behavior and moving towards a sustainable solution. The research conducted and supervised by undergraduate students has significance in the broader, professional area of geochemistry, environmental health and sustainable agriculture. That fact plays an important role in how the students see themselves in the process and what motivated them to: 1. Choose to participate in the research in the first place, 2. Reach out to the broader community (scientific and regional) to carry out their research and 3. Pursue solutions beyond the classroom and summer research experience.",

            "abstract": "The Chron C19r event in the late middle Eocene was first described at ODP Site 1260 in the equatorial Atlantic. It is characterized by strong dissolution expressed in a dark, clay-rich layer and a distinct peak in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning Fe intensities as well as by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in bulk sediment. All similar to early Paleogene hyperthermal events - the Chron C19r event could also be a hyperthermal event but in the late middle Eocene. The dissolution of carbonate at Site 1260 prevented so far to retrieve a benthic stable isotope record with a typical CIE and warming of deep water. The C19r event occurred ~1.0 myr prior to the onset of the Middle Eocene Climate Optimum (MECO, 40.5 Ma) and several million years after the Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, 51 Ma) during a slightly cooler climate. No significant CCD changes have been observed one million years before and after the event as expressed by regular Fe cycles at Site 1260. The duration of the event estimated by orbital calibration is in the order of 40-50 kyr, similar to other transient hyperthermals in the early to middle Eocene.\nHere we present new high-resolution bulk and benthic stable isotope data revealing the widespread nature of the event. We investigated ODP Sites 702B (~2200m) near the crest of the Islas Orcadas Rise in the southern South Atlantic, 1263 (~1800 m) on Walvis Ridge in the SE Atlantic, and 1051 (2100 m) on Blake Nose in the NW Atlantic. The position of the event was initially narrowed by careful analysis of magnetostratigraphy and XRF scanning data. First results of stable isotope data show a ~0.7 δ13C and ~0.4‰ δ18O excursion very similar to the pattern observed at Site 1260. Although the magnitude of the bulk δ13C excursion is comparable, the bulk δ18O excursion at Site 702B is only a third of that observed at Site 1260 which might be related to diagenetic and/or latitudinal effects. 702B benthic isotope data show a ~0.75 ‰ CIE and a ~0.4‰ shift in δ18O. For the first time the new records validate the C19r event in the southern South Atlantic and its ocean-wide if not global nature with a ~2°C deep sea warming. The magnitudes of the CIE and δ18O excursion are comparable to the H2 event (53.6 Ma) suggesting a similar response of the climate system to carbon cycle perturbations even in relatively cooler climate.",

            "abstract": "Observations and climate projections show a high sensitivity of the Arctic climate to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, known as the polar amplification. This study evaluates the options of counteracting the rising polar temperatures by stratospheric sulphur injections in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes.10 Mt of sulphur dioxide are emitted in a point emission source setup centred at the 100 hPa pressure level over Svalbard island (80°N,15°E). We perform simulations with the general circulation models ECHAM5, ECHAM6, and GISS ModelE.\nWe study pulsed emission simulations that differ among themselves by the injection starting date (March-September), injection length (1, 30, or 90 day emission period), and the vertical resolution of the model (for ECHAM6).\nWe find injections in April to be the most efficient in terms of the shortwave radiative forcing at the top-of-the atmosphere over the Arctic region. The distribution of sulphate aerosol spreads out beyond the injection region, with a significant share reaching the Southern Hemisphere.\nResults from ModelE show high latitude injections could counteract the spring and summer temperature increase due to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Preliminary results with a more realistic description of clouds in ECHAM-HAM reveal a complex pattern of responses, most notably:\na decrease in Northern Hemisphere cirrus clouds strengthening the effect of stratospheric aerosols in ECHAM5\na decrease in low-level clouds over the Arctic increasing the incoming solar radiation and causing a net positive radiative balance\ncirrus clouds are resilient to stratospheric sulphur injections in the absence of sulphate warming ",

            "abstract": "Separated and in situ ultrahigh pressure (UHP), highly reduced and crustal-type minerals are common in podiform chromitites of the Luobusa and Dongqiao ophiolites, Tibet and the Ray-Iz ophiolite of the Polar Urals, Russia. Highly reduced and crustal-type minerals have also been recovered from the Oman ophiolite. UHP minerals include diamond, coesite-stishovite and kyanite, whereas highly reduced minerals are mainly moissanite (SiC), native elements (e.g., Si, Fe, Cr, Al, Ti, Mn, W, Ta) and a wide variety of metallic alloys. Crustal-type minerals are represented by various combinations of zircon, corundum, almandine garnet, kyanite, andalusite, quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, apatite, amphibole, rutile, and titanite. Most in-situ grains are hosted in small, circular to irregular patches of amorphous carbon within grains of magnesiochromite, indicating the former presence of a C-rich fluid, either during or after crystallization of the chromite. The recovered zircons are typically rounded to sub-rounded grains with complex internal structures indicating polyphase growth. Their trace element contents and low-pressure inclusion assemblages (quartz, muscovite, K-feldspar, apatite, ilmenite, rutile) indicate a continental crustal origin. The zircons have SIMS U-Pb ages that are generally much older than the host ophiolite (total range: 90 to 2500 Ma). The presence of numerous crustal minerals, particularly zircon, suggests derivation from metasedimentary rocks subducted into the mantle. The preservation of UHP, highly reduced and crustal-type minerals in chromitites implies effective isolation from the mafic melts that formed the ophiolites and chromitites. Clearly, the formation of ophiolites and podiform chromitites must be a complex, multistage process involving crystallization of magnesiochromite grains at depth in the upper mantle, upwelling of the host peridotites and chromitites, capture of mantle wedges above suprasubduction zones, further crystallization and modification of magnesiochromite grains, allowing incorporation of crustal-type minerals from the underlying subducting slab. Slab rollback and/or slab tear may facilitate uprise of mantle peridotites leading to concentration of podiform chromitites within individual ophiolitic blocks.",

            "abstract": "The δD is an important probe for studying the cycle of water within the Earth and between planetary bodies. D/H fractionation between silicate melts, minerals, aqueous fluids and gases governed the δD-evolution of the various geochemical reservoirs. It is usually assumed that D+ and H+ have the same chemical properties and structural environments in silicate melts and aqueous fluids, so that the only mass-dependent fractionation takes place with values approaching 1 at magmatic temperatures. However, recent in situ studies reveal important D/H fractionation between silicate melts and aqueous fluids even at high temperature. H and D MAS NMR data from sodium silicate glasses also shown that D+ and H+ occupy different structural positions in the structure of silicate glasses. This suggests that mass-dependent fractionation is not the only factor governing D/H fractionation in magmatic systems.\nTo assess how the chemical composition and the structure of alkali silicate glasses affect the environments of H+ and D+, the H and D MAS NMR spectra of M2Si4O9 glasses (M = Li, Na or K) with different concentrations of pure H2O or D2O (from 3.3 up to 17.6 mol%) were recorded. Other spectra were acquired from M2Si4O9 glasses with 17.6 mol%(1H,1D)2O. Signals at ~1, ~3.5, ~5, ~12 and ~16 ppm in 1H MAS NMR spectra are assigned to H+ in H2O molecules and Si-OH groups in the glasses. These five signals indicates protons distribution between at least five environments with O…O distances ranging from ~305 to ~240 pm. The ionic radius of alkali affects the distribution of H+ between those environments.\nD MAS NMR spectra reveal that by exchanging H+ with D+, the intensity of the 16 ppm NMR line increases, whereas the intensity of the 5 ppm line decreases. Consequently, D+ seems to be more concentrated than H+ in environments with small O...O distances. In other words, the structural environments of H+ and D+ in the silicate glasses, and hence in melts at their glass transition temperature, differ. These structural differences may promote fractionation of H+ and D+ during melting, crystallization and exsolution of aqueous fluids from magma in the Earth's interior. These effects, in turn, may cause variations of δD between the different Earth reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Preliminary results from a combined radar-microwave radiometer study using in-situ microphysics data and other observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Cold season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) will be presented in this study. The primary purpose of this work is to assess microwave ice particle scattering models by comparing forward model calculations with dual-frequency airborne radar and multi-frequency passive microwave observations of select surface snowfall events from GCPEx. Forward model radar and radiometer calculations require snowflake scattering properties to be integrated over particle size distributions, and both of these inherent microphysical quantities strongly influence unconstrained radar-radiometer simulations under snowing conditions. Therefore, direct airborne and ground-based ice particle size distribution measurements and other relevant microphysical properties will be used to build a physically realistic microphysical rendition of the atmospheric column to simulate both layer radar reflectivity signatures and top-of-the-atmosphere microwave radiometer brightness temperatures for select GCPEx cases. Comparisons of measured particle size distributions will also be made to particle size distribution parameter retrievals from airborne-only observations, and the subsequent sensitivity in simulated brightness temperatures will be discussed. Other simulation complicating factors (e.g., surface emissivity effects, cloud liquid water location and amount, etc.) and implications for GPM radar and radiometer retrievals will also be highlighted.",

            "abstract": "Data democracy is a concept that has great relevance to the use and value of geospatial data and scientific information. Data democracy describes a world in which data and information are widely and broadly accessible, understandable, and useable. The concept operationalizes the public good nature of scientific information and provides a framework for increasing benefits from its use.\nData democracy encompasses efforts to increase accessibility to geospatial data and to expand participation in its collection, analysis, and application. These two pillars are analogous to demand and supply relationships. Improved accessibility, or demand, includes increased knowledge about geospatial data and low barriers to retrieval and use. Expanded participation, or supply, encompasses a broader community involved in developing geospatial data and scientific information. This pillar of data democracy is characterized by methods such as citizen science or crowd sourcing.\nA framework is developed for advancing the use of data democracy. This includes efforts to assess the societal benefits (economic and social) of scientific information. This knowledge is critical to continued monitoring of the effectiveness of data democracy implementation and of potential impact on the use and value of scientific information.\nThe framework also includes an assessment of opportunities for advancing data democracy both on the supply and demand sides. These opportunities include relatively inexpensive efforts to reduce barriers to use as well as the identification of situations in which participation can be expanded in scientific efforts to enhance the breadth of involvement as well as expanding participation to non-traditional communities.\nThis framework provides an initial perspective on ways to expand the “scientific community” of data users and providers. It also describes a way forward for enhancing the societal benefits from geospatial data and scientific information. As a result, data democracy not only provides benefits to a greater population, it enhances the value of science.",

            "abstract": "We present new wet chemical determination of the Fe3+/ΣFe ratio for 41 glassy samples from the East Scotia back-arc basin (South Atlantic) showing a chemical continuum from MORB-like to arc-like compositions. The Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of East Scotia samples vary from 0.05 to 0.21. Proxies of subduction inputs such as H8.0 (H2O content corrected for fractional crystallization) and Ba/Y ratios display along the ridge axis three arc-like spikes (H8.0> 1.5 wt.%; Ba/Y >2) that are correlated to high Fe3+/ΣFe ratios (0.21, 0.18, and 0.20). MORB-like samples (H8.0<0.3; Ba/Y<2) display lower Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of 0.08±0.02. We show that fractional crystallization processes cannot account solely for the observed Fe3+/ΣFe variation and propose that the high Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of arc-like samples reflect higher oxidation states of primary magmas compared to MORB-like samples.\nPrevious studies have shown that the northernmost subduction spike is characterized by a complex interplay between various subduction inputs and the westward inflow of enriched mantle derived from the Bouvet hotspot. We did not find evidence for any influence of the OIB-like enriched mantle on the Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of lavas samples. Correlations between Fe3+/ΣFe and trace element ratios diagnostic of subduction inputs (e.g. Ba/Y, r=0.83) indicate that input of water-rich subduction components is related to high oxidation states in arc-like samples. Further south, the inflow of Bouvet mantle fades to almost no influence and reveals the central spike that show the most arc-like influence with the contribution of water-rich and sediment-melts components. In this section, the Fe3+/ΣFe is also strongly and positively correlated with Ba/Y ratios (r=0.85) and shows, for a given Ba/Y ratio and compared to northern and central samples, lower Fe3+/ΣFe ratios. Finally, when the southern samples are characterized by high H2O/[LILE] ratios. The Fe3+/ΣFe ratio of southern samples is also strongly correlated with the Ba/Y ratio (r=0.94) showing, for a given Ba/Y higher Fe3+/ΣFe ratios compared to samples from the northern spike. East Scotia back-arc lavas display 3 different relationships between Fe3+/ΣFe data and proxies of subduction inputs. We discuss the origin of those 3 different trends and the potential mantle wedge oxidation by subduction fluids.",

Such basin were formed in association with the subduction of the Pacific plate, the opening of the Caribbean or the growth of allocthonous oceanic arcs and were extensively deformed in the Late Cretaceous initiation of Andean orogeny.\nTectonic models for these basins have been mainly postulated from the stratigraphic interpretations or regional characterization of the tectonomagmatic affinity of volcanic rocks. Less attention have been paid on the pontential to evaluate the tectonic history from the characterization of the paleothermal record recorded in diagenetic and very low grade metamorphic evolution of the pelitic rock.\nIn the Central Cordillera outcrops two main Albian Cretaceous units: the Abejorral formation which is characterized by a pelitic succession with minor sandstones beds and the Quebradagrande Complex that include intercalations of volcanic and pelitic rocks. Such relatively deep accumulation environment is contemporaneous with shallow carbonates and pelitic succesions in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes.\nRocks from the Eastern Cordillera that have been widely characterized due to their relation with petroleum exploration are characterized limited development of cleavage and well defined sedimentary structures. In contrast field field relations have shown that the central Cordillera units are characterized by the development of a well defined slaty cleavage, limited development of quartz veins.\nPublished vitrinite constraints from the Eastern Cordillera have revealed very high burial temperatures which is compatible with proposed extensional setting during burial and accumulation. New illite and chlorite mineralogical characterization is being obtained on the Abejorral and Quebradagrande formation in order to test if the low grade metamorphic record still preserved the high geothermal gradient expected from an accumulation environment and the quick transition from extension to compression.",

In this paper, we report experimental measurements of mean velocities and turbulent fluctuations in the upper five pore spaces of an idealized gravel bed beneath a turbulent water flow. These experiments were conducted in the Hyporheic Flow Facility (HFF) at the University of Illinois. Systematic two-dimensional flow measurements were collected by an endoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry technique (EPIV), at five different pore locations with varying wall-normal distance from the interface. Several different surface flow conditions varying in Re and Froude have been investigated for all the pore space measurements. Herein, we report on the effect of the flow Reynolds number and Froude number on the flow structure within these five pore spaces, and examine the changing nature of mean flow and turbulence penetration with depth in the sediment bed.",

            "abstract": "The Turkey Lake Watershed (TLW) is located on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario, Canada and has been the site of multi-discipline ecosystem research since 1979. The 10.5 km2 watershed is within the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence forest region with an uneven-aged tolerant hardwood forest having 90% of the basal area as mature to over-mature sugar maple. Podzolic soils and small forested wetlands have developed in the complex topography of the watershed where variable glacial till deposits occur over predominantly metamorphic silicate bedrock. Within the watershed, 13 first-order catchments that vary in size and topography have been monitored to elucidate spatio-temporal processes controlling run-off patterns. Over the 35 year period mean annual air temperatures at the TLW have increased at a rate of 0.75 oC per decade, with large inter-annual climate variability due to the influence of regional climate oscillations. As a result of warmer climate there has been a decline in annual export of water, as well as, changes in the seasonal distribution of runoff, Snowmelt has been occurring earlier and the number of zero-flow days are increasing. Declines in runoff were greater for catchments with steep slopes and less for those with shallow slopes and wetland areas. The large year to year variability in weather conditions made detecting the impacts on runoff from different harvesting treatments in 1997 difficult. These changes and fluctuations in water yields induced by fluctuating and changing climate have been shown to have had large consequences on element (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) cycling within and export from catchments.",

            "abstract": "Since the late 1980s a large number of numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models has been used to assess the impacts of deforestation on global and regional climate, and one of the main motivations is the Amazon rainforest. In the same way, in the last decade several studies have shown that a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere could lead changes in climate in the Amazon region. In this study we performed new analyses to quantify how deforestation, fire and the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration may combine to affect the climate in Amazonia during this century. For the projection of land use was considered a spatially explicit land use scenario from Aguiar et al. (2013). The scenario was built using LuccME generic modelling framework and the potential of change considering the proximity to previously deforested areas and also spatial drivers (roads and protected areas). In order to quantify the response of Brazilian Earth System Model, with INLAND-IBIS surface model, to climate change, deforestation and forest fire we performed a suite of simulations in two main categories: 1) the model was running under historical and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration, and 2) the model was forced by the same configuration in 1 but also considering the effects of deforestation and forest fire in Amazon. In summary, the most important changes occur in the East/Northeast and South of the Amazonia and are more evident when are considered all effects (climate change, deforestation and fire). The results show warmer near-surface air temperature in all cases compared to the control case. This relative warming of the deforested land surface is consistent with the reduction in evapotranspiration, the lower leaf area and the lower surface roughness length. There is a reduction in annual precipitation in both cases mainly over eastern/northeastern Amazonia. The reduction in precipitation occurs mainly during the dry season (June-November) in both cases, and there is an increase in dry season length that is more evident when are considered all effects. In summary, we conclude that the synergistic combination of deforestation and climate change resulting from global warming may lead to important impacts that add considerably to the vulnerability of tropical forest ecosystems in the region.",

During this campaign, smoke originating from agricultural fires in the Mississippi River Valley contributed up to 80% of the aerosol optical depths (AODs) and thus complicated estimation of ground-level PM2.5 from AOD. Comparison with measurements of fresh agricultural fires during both DISCOVER-AQ and SEAC4RS showed that these lofted layers were considerably aged with higher single scattering albedos and water-uptake potential (f(RH)). This more hygroscopic aged smoke (with f(RH)’s of 1.5) created higher AODs than would be obtained if fresh smoke (f(RH) on the order of 1.1) had been present. In addition, profiling done as part of SEAC4RS throughout the Southeast will be compared to ground-based PM2.5 allowing for determination of background aerosol vertical distributions in the region and the extent of the smoke transport. Historic long-term measurements of AOD (from AERONET) and PM2.5 (from ground-based monitoring sites) will also be addressed to determine the frequency of these long-range transport events.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the temporal evolution of runoff source areas represents a grand challenge in hydrology. While catchment structural characteristics, including topography and soils, are known to drive hydrologic connectivity of upland areas to the riparian and stream system, the effects of vegetation on the connectedness of water flow pathways are less well identified. The combination of lateral water redistribution by topographically driven drainage and water uptake by vegetation leads to shifting patterns of catchment storage. Hydrologic response exhibits threshold behavior with the transition from unsaturated to saturated subsurface conditions. This threshold nature in conjunction with changing storage patterns leads to effective runoff sources areas that are dynamic through time. To investigate these dynamics, we developed and applied a parsimonious but spatially distributed watershed modeling framework and used it to quantify the effects of vegetation on the temporal evolution of catchment connectivity over two years in a snow-dominated watershed in central Montana. Spatially distributed catchment water inputs were derived from two NRCS SNOTEL sites nearby with a simple temperature based snowmelt model. Evapotranspiration was measured at an eddy-covariance tower in the watershed and disaggregated based on vegetation structure. We used this modeling framework to further explore the effects of different vegetation pattern scenarios on the temporal expansion and cessation of catchment connectivity. With this work we seek to improve our understanding of how the intersection of physical (topography) and biological (vegetation) factors mediates hydrologic connectivity in headwater catchments.",

            "abstract": "The Guatemala Suture Zone (GSZ) is located along the left-lateral strike slip boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates in central Guatemala. This highly tectonized geotectonic unit contains a variety of metamorphic complexes thrusted north and south of the plate boundary. The northern section of the GSZ consists of (a) a serpentinite-matrix mélange that contains high-pressure–low-temperature (HP–LT) rocks, (b) a continental high-grade felsic belt that includes relics of eclogite facies, (c) a low-grade disrupted volcano-sedimentary sequence, and (d) large ultramafic bodies associated with fragments of Cretaceous island arc sequences. Currently, this section of the GSZ is interpreted as the result of subduction-exhumation-collision and obduction in a back-arc basin.\nHowever, our new petrochronological study challenges this simple interpretation because multiple metamorphic ages (Sm–Nd, U–Pb and Ar–Ar) and different PT paths are recorded in the HP–LT rocks. Eclogites within the mélange display a polymetamorphic history consisting of a metamorphic peak at 130–125 Ma and ~60 km depth, an early exhumation to the middle section of a subduction channel (~35 km) at 117–116 Ma, a subsequent metamorphic event at amphibolite facies and a final exhumation at ~85 Ma. In contrast, continental eclogites show a younger metamorphic peak of 77–75 Ma at ~80 km depth, and exhumation ages of ~76–66 Ma. Synchronous jadeitite and mica rocks within the mélange yielded crystallization and exhumation ages of ~ 95 Ma and ~77–53 Ma, respectively.\nThese PTt paths reveal a complex history that can be linked to multiple tectonic events during subduction. Ages and PT conditions of eclogites within the mélange suggest an early coupling and storage of eclogitic slices in the subduction channel. Their subsequent record at lower P and higher T may indicate the initiation of continental crust subduction which will have increased the subduction thermal gradient. Continuous subduction and fluid infiltration into the mantle wedge is indicated by the occurrence of jadeitites and mica rocks within the serpentinite mélange. Finally, the metamorphic peak of continental eclogites may mark the end of subduction and beginning of exhumation of the subduction channel and the subducted continental crust during a major collisional event.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircons (DZs) represent a powerful tool for reconstructing continental paleodrainage. This paper uses new DZ data from Lower Cretaceous strata of the Alberta foreland basin, and Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata of the Gulf of Mexico passive margin, to reconstruct paleodrainage and sediment routing, and illustrate significance to giant hydrocarbon systems. DZ populations from the Lower Cretaceous Mannville Group of Alberta and Saskatchewan infer a continental-scale river system that routed sediment from the eastern 2/3rds of North America to the Boreal Sea. Aptian McMurray Formation fluvial sands were derived from a drainage sourced in the Appalachians that was similar in scale to the modern Amazon. Albian fluvial sandstones of the Clearwater and Grand Rapids Formations were derived from the same Appalachian-sourced drainage area, which had expanded to include tributaries from the Cordilleran arc of the northwest US and southwest Canada. DZ populations from the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain complement this view, showing that only the southern US and Appalachian-Ouachita cordillera was integrated with the Gulf through the Late Cretaceous. However, by the Paleocene, drainage from the US Western Cordillera to the Appalachians had been routed to the Gulf of Mexico, establishing the template for sediment routing that persists today. The paleodrainage reorganization and changes in sediment routing described above played key roles in establishment of the Alberta oil sands and Gulf of Mexico as giant petroleum provinces. Early Cretaceous routing of a continental-scale fluvial system to the Alberta foreland provided large and contiguous fluvial point-bar sand bodies that became economically viable reservoirs, whereas mid- to late Cretaceous drainage reorganization routed greatly increased sediment loads to the Gulf of Mexico, which loaded the shelf, matured source rocks, and drove the gravitational and salt tectonics that helped establish the working hydrocarbon systems extant today.",

            "abstract": "Experiments to determine the H storage capacity of nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) can be used to place strong constraints on the degree of hydration required to initiate volatile fluxed melting in the mantle. Moreover, accurate measurements of H in NAMs from mantle xenoliths may be used to constrain the rheological properties of the source region. However, accurate measurements of H concentrations using infrared and ion beam techniques require mineral specific calibrations. Standardless measurements of H using elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) in some cases have provided valuable verification of calibrations for other techniques, but so far have had limited application to experimental samples owing to sample size and analytical background. Results of recent measurements of H in garnet, pyroxene and feldspar will be used to illustrate the potential of the technique. Some of the results we will present include the following:\n1) Forsterites grown at 2 and 3 GPa in the MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system exhibit low frequency absorption bands in the OH stretching region between 3300 and 3400 cm-1, but very limited absorption at higher frequencies where the strongest absorption bands are usually seen for Al-free olivine. Analyses of H in these samples by ERDA will be used to develop a tentative site-specific molar absorption coefficient for the low frequency OH absorption band.\n2) ERDA measurements of H in silicate glass standards verify previous determinations by Karl Fischer titration and FTIR spectroscopy, validating the ERDA technique. Samples of these rhyolitic glasses are available on request for use as analytical standards, and come with a compendium of analyses that have been used to characterize major and minor elemental composition and H content.\n3) ERDA measurements of three homogeneous grossular garnets from East Africa show an excellent correlation (r2 = 1) with absorbance in the O-H stretching region and indicate an integral molar absorption coefficient significantly higher than that determined by Rossman and Aines (1991) based on reduction of a global data set on grossulars and hydrogrossulars with 0.2-13 wt% H2O. These new results can be reconciled well with a model for matrix effects in SIMS analysis of H in NAMs presented elsewhere at this meeting (Mosenfelder and Rossman).",

            "abstract": "Paleoceanographic studies have used Nd isotope ratios to characterize paleo-ocean deep-water mass distributions. The Southern Ocean has nearly homogeneous εNd that reflects the relative inputs from the north Atlantic and north Pacific, offering the possibility to quantify the AMOC strength through time. However, obtaining an εNd record from the Southern Ocean is a challenge because carbonates are poorly preserved there, hindering stratigraphic control and generally precluding use of this important substrate. Alternatively, studies of deep-sea corals and ferromanganese crusts provide snapshots or poor time resolution.\nDeep-sea core E33-22 (55°S, 120°W, 2743m) lies in the polar frontal zone of the Pacific sector, above the carbonate compensation depth, where foraminifera are preserved. It spans ~400,000 years (from the Holocene to MIS11) with a sedimentation rate of ~2.5 cm/kyr. We measured its εNd record with the purpose of determining the best estimate of the export of NADW out of the Atlantic system, which we suggest is our best measure of the vigor of the global thermohaline circulation system. The record shows expected εNd variability during orbital and sub-orbital time-scales, that is lower εNd during warm and higher εNd during cold climate intervals. Moreover, the record passes a critical test in that εNd-values are almost always between South Atlantic and Pacific values. The only exceptions are glacial periods when they coincide with South Atlantic values, indicating extension of Southern Ocean system into the South Atlantic. We conclude that these data represent a conservative record of AMOC variability through the late Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "The lateral expansion and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau causes devastating earthquakes, but is poorly understood. In particular, the links between regional variations in surface motion and the deeper structure of the plateau are still unclear. The plateau may deform either by movement of rigid crustal blocks along large strike-slip faults, by continuous deformation, or by the eastward flow of a channel of viscous crustal rocks. Recently, high resolution seismic imaging, by using seismic data recorded with an array of about 300 seismographs in western Sichuan, China, has identified zones of weak rocks in the deep crust, which is interpreted as crustal flow channels. They also found gradual crust-mantle transition as commonly found in tectonically active area. Here we further identify the upper and lower boundary of the transitional Moho under the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau using the same data set. The upper layer of the boundary is relatively clear and thicker than normal Moho discontinuity. The lower boundary is commonly visible under the Chuan-dian block despite it is normally weaker. Combined with the widely spread low-velocity middle and lower crust and upper-most mantle, this may indicate the geodynamic process in the region of the Eastern Tibetan Plateau is not solely limited in the crust, the whole lithosphere could have involved in the building of the plateau and the collision between the Tibetan Plateau and the Yangzi block.",

            "abstract": "We report the results of a pilot study, searching for occultations of\nbackground stars by small (sub-km) Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Our\nstudy is ground-based, using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and\nSpectrograph (IMACS) instrument on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope,\nat Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. We implemented a novel\nshutterless continuous readout mode on the IMACS instrument, with\ncustom-made aperture masks, permitting simultaneous high-speed (36 Hz)\nphotometry for numerous stars, while minimizing the effects of stellar\ncrowding and sky background. Observing in the southern hemisphere\nallows us to target the intersection of the ecliptic and galactic\nplanes, where hundreds of stars can be monitored with a single field\nof view. We observed for a total of ~28 hours spread over eight\nnights, obtaining ~11,000 star-hours of light curves with per-point\nSNR > 10. This represents an order of magnitude increase in star-hours\ncompared to the previous best ground-based survey by Bianco et\nal. (2009). Our results allow us to place strong constraints on the surface\ndensity of sub-km objects in the Kuiper-Belt, as well as to complement the\nHST FGS results of Schlichting et al. (2009, 2012).",

            "abstract": "We have developed a new method of constraining geotherms deep in the crust. Steady-state geotherms are most commonly derived by solving the heat flow differential equation with surface boundary conditions, and do not explicitly involve temperature constraints at depth. In a new method, we incorporate the magnetic Curie depth, derived from the spectral analysis of magnetic anomaly data, as an a posteriori condition into the solution of 1-D heat-flow equation to anchor geotherms at the Curie depth. The Curie depth is derived carefully from the Defractal Spectral Method where the fractal parameter of the field is also derived. The Curie depth constraint allows determination of an additional parameter: the ratio of radiogenic heat production (A) to thermal conductivity (K). When K is observed or can be estimated from geologic knowledge, A can be calculated. Furthermore, it is possible to renormalize the derived A to the value where radiogenic elements exponentially decrease with depth (the value of A at the surface denoted as As). The renormalization permits comparison of surface observed and computed values of As which we use to validate the method. We crosschecked observed values of As and K against the ratio As/K derived from the method in New Hampshire and across the border of Wyoming and Colorado. Excluding high heat-flow locations in these regions as anomalous, the difference between the observed and computed As in all these cases is less than 6-7%. There are also regions where both the derived parameters (As and K) are not within the acceptable range for the given reduced heat flow; these are generally the regions of complex active tectonics or anomalously high or low heat-flow values where the steady-state assumption is not valid. In the mid-oceanic ridge scenario of the Red Sea, the Curie depth corresponds to the Moho and reasonable values of K yield low values of A consistent with the expectation from mafic oceanic crust. There are many areas of the world where high quality aeromagnetic data are available and, therefore, our new method will be useful in constraining lithospheric geotherms and thermal parameters where the steady-state assumption is valid in a regional sense. One could also use the method of constraining geotherms to deep crustal temperature proxies other than the Curie depth.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA’s Drought Task Force was first established in October 2011 and renewed in October 2014 with the goal of achieving significant new advances in the ability to understand, monitor and predict drought over North America. The Task Force is an initiative of NOAA’s Climate Program Office Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program in support of the National Integrated Drought Information System NIDIS. The Drought Task Force also represents an important research contribution to efforts to develop an international Global Drought Information System (GDIS). The Drought Task Force brings together leading drought scientists research laboratories and/or operational centers from NOAA, other U.S. agencies laboratories and academia. Their concerted research effort builds on individual MAPP research projects and related drought-research sector developments. The projects span the wide spectrum of drought research needed to make fundamental advances, from those aimed at the basic understanding of drought mechanisms to those evaluating new drought monitoring and prediction tools for operational and service purposes.\nThis contribution will present an overview of Drought Task Force activities and plans to date, including highlights of research activities and how the group has been working in partnership with NIDIS and synergy with GDIS to advance the science underpinning the development, assessment and provision of drought information.",

            "abstract": "Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) in hot dry rock frequently underperform or fail due to insufficient reservoir characterization and poorly controlled permeability stimulation. Our new EGS design is based on the concept of a cooling radiator of an internal combustion engine, which we call the Radiator EGS (RAD-EGS). Within a hot sedimentary aquifer, we propose to construct vertically extensive heat exchanger vanes, which consist of rubblized zones of high permeability and which emulate a hydrothermal system. A “crows-foot” lateral drilling pattern at multiple levels is used to form a vertical array that includes S1 and Shmax. To create the radiator, we propose to use propellant fracing. System cool-down is delayed by regional background flow and induced upward flow of the coolant which initially heats the rock. Tomographic Fracture Imaging is used to image and control the permeability field changes. Preliminary heat transfer calculations suggest that the RAD-EGS will allow for commercial electricity production for at least several tens of years.",

            "abstract": "Over long timescales, microbial populations and communities living in environments where CO2 has been sequestered will adapt to this environmental stress. Their presence and activities can have implications for fluid flow, geochemistry, and the fate of the stored CO2. Because of the interplay between microorganisms and environment, many environmental factors beyond CO2 will also contribute to community structure, including groundwater composition and mineralogy. To determine the long-term effect of CO2 on microbial communities, we analyzed terrestrial CO2 springs as analogues to CO2 sequestration in 3 locations in the United States: the Little Grand Wash Fault (LGW), UT; Bravo Dome (BD), NM; and Klickitat Mineral Spring (KMS), WA. These sites differed in multiple aspects such as depth, salinity, Fe content, and mineralogy. LGW and BD were located in the Colorado Plateau in sedimentary locations while KMS was located within the Columbia River Basalt Group. Sites were compared to non-CO2 springs in similar sedimentary formations for comparison. Microbial communities from sedimentary formations were characterized by low diversity and the dominance of the phylotypes Acinetobacter or Burkholderia compared to non-CO2 springs, suggesting community stress and the selection of specific organisms most resilient to CO2. Communities in the basalt formation were more diverse, though diversity is lower than a non-CO2 community sampled from the same formation (Lavalleur and Colwell 2013). Organisms present at the basalt site contained novel lineages, such as the OP candidate phyla. KMS was also the only site containing Archaea, such as Methanoplanus, suggesting CH4 production at depth. Statistical analyses indicate other factors such as depth and nutrient availability may be other factors that can affect diversity in addition to CO2. Growth of a CO2-tolerant organism from LGW also shows organisms in these environments are viable. Results confirm the presence of microbial communities at high PCO2 and suggest that while CO2 is one environmental stress that can lower diversity, many other environmental factors can also influence survival.\nLavalleur, H.J., Colwell, F.S., 2013.

            "abstract": "The Sample Acquisition/Sample Processing and Handling (SA/SPaH) subsystem for the Mars Science Library (MSL) is a rover-based sampling system. SA/SPaH consists of a powdering drill and a scooping, sieving, and portioning device mounted on a turret at the end of a robotic arm. Curiosity rover preformed several sample acquisitions and processing of solid samples during its first year of operation. Material were processed and delivered to the two analytical instruments, Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) and Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), both of which required specific particle size for the material delivered to them to perform their analysis to determine its mineralogy and geochemistry content. In this presentation, the functionality of the system will be explained along with the in-situ targets the system has acquire and the samples that were delivered.",

Hosted at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), OT utilizes cyberinfrastructure, including large-scale data management, high-performance computing, and service-oriented architectures to provide efficient Web based access to large, high-resolution topographic datasets. OT collocates data with processing tools to enable users to quickly access custom data and derived products for their application. OT’s ongoing R&D efforts aim to solve emerging technical challenges associated with exponential growth in data, higher order data products, as well as user base.\nOptimization of data management strategies can be informed by a comprehensive set of OT user access metrics that allows us to better understand usage patterns with respect to the data. By analyzing the spatiotemporal access patterns within the datasets, we can map areas of the data archive that are highly active (hot) versus the ones that are rarely accessed (cold). This enables us to architect a tiered storage environment consisting of high performance disk storage (SSD) for the hot areas and less expensive slower disk for the cold ones, thereby optimizing price to performance.\nFrom a compute perspective, OT is looking at cloud based solutions such as the Microsoft Azure platform to handle sudden increases in load. An OT virtual machine image in Microsoft’s VM Depot can be invoked and deployed quickly in response to increased system demand. OT has also integrated SDSC HPC systems like the Gordon supercomputer into our infrastructure tier to enable compute intensive workloads like parallel computation of hydrologic routing on high resolution topography. This capability also allows OT to scale to HPC resources during high loads to meet user demand and provide more efficient processing.\nWith a growing user base and maturing scientific user community comes new requests for algorithms and processing capabilities. To address this demand, OT is developing an extensible service based architecture for integrating community-developed software. This “plugable” approach to Web service deployment will enable new processing and analysis tools to run collocated with OT hosted data.",

            "abstract": "Since April 2012, the University of Delaware has operated a real-time water quality monitoring station at Bowers, DE, to determine the effect of nutrient loads from the Murderkill Estuary to the Delaware Bay. The Land Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory (LOBO; Hach/Sea-Bird Electronics) is deployed under a public dock, with support from the Kent County Board of Public Works and Delaware’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, and in collaboration with the USGS that operates a gauging station at the same site (01484085). Every hour the LOBO measures salinity, temperature, pressure, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, CDOM, nitrate (NO3-) and orthophosphate (PO43-). Ebb tide measurements reflect conditions in the Estuary and flood tide measurements reflect conditions in Delaware Bay. Real-time data are available to the public at kentcounty.loboviz.com.\nUsing hourly data from the LOBO, we are able to assess the nutrient and particle exchange between the Murderkill and the Delaware Bay, as well as biogeochemical and ecological responses to this exchange. Primary production in the turbid Estuary is low and nutrients from the Murderkill are efficiently delivered to Delaware Bay, where O2 production response to nitrate influx is almost instantaneous. In the summer, during the day, nutrients originating in the Estuary (ebb tide NO3- > 50-60 μM) stimulate phytoplankton growth in Delaware Bay, indicated by chlorophyll increases and O2 supersaturation during flood tide. This suggests that the Murderkill and other similar tributaries are important nutrient sources to the Delaware Bay. We use a phase-sensitive analysis to extract data characterizing the Delaware Bay, and then use dissolved oxygen to calculate rates of primary production and respiration. Newly produced Delaware Bay phytoplankton (often > 40 µg Chla L-1) may be an important labile carbon source supporting respiration in the Estuary and its surrounding salt marshes.",

When they are sufficiently well-resolved in time, paleoceanographic tracer proxy time series at multiple locations sample the propagation of tracer signals through the global ocean and can be used to constrain the ocean circulation, including during times of climate transience. Using a Green function approach, we derive a time-dependent solution for ML equilibrium calcite δ18O (δ18Oc) during the last deglaciation from a least-squares fit of eight benthic foraminiferal δ18O records to an estimate of the modern ocean circulation. Within uncertainty, inferred deglacial histories of ML δ18Oc in the Northern North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean mixed layers are indistinguishable. A comparison of the derived solution to planktonic foraminiferal δ18O records is unable to disprove the null hypothesis that the modern ocean circulation persisted during the last deglaciation. In order to disprove the null hypothesis, it is necessary to reduce uncertainties in inferred ML δ18Oc histories, perhaps by including additional records. The utility of benthic records to reduce uncertainties is quantified, with implications for future paleoceanographic sampling strategies.",

In fact, the diversity of disciplines and size of the community (roughly one-third of Earth-science faculty in US universities) itself has been a barrier to the formation of collaborative, multidisciplinary teams in the past. STEPPE has been working to support new research synergies and the development of infrastructure that will encourage the community to think about the big problems that need to be solved and facilitate the formation of collaborative research teams to tackle these problems. Toward this end, STEPPE is providing opportunities for workshops, working groups and professional development training sessions, web-hosting and database services and an online collaboration platform that facilitates interaction among participants, the sharing of documentation and workflows and an ability to push news and reports to group participants and beyond using social media tools. As such, STEPPE is working to provide an interactive space that will serve as both a gathering place and clearinghouse for information, allowing for broader integration of research and education across all STEPPE-related sub disciplines.",

            "abstract": "The internal structure of major strike-slip faults is still poorly understood, particularly how the deep structure could be inferred from its surface expression (Molnar and Dayem, 2011). Previous analogue experiments suggest that the convergence angle is the most influential factor (Leever et al., 2011). Further analogue modeling may allow a better understanding how to extrapolate surface structures to the subsurface geometry of strike-slip faults. Various scenarios of analogue experiments were designed to represent strike-slip faults in nature from different geological settings. As such key parameters, which are investigated in this study include: (a) the angle of convergence, (b) the thickness of brittle layer, (c) the influence of a rheological weak layer within the crust, and (d) influence of a thick and rheologically weak layer at the base of the crust. The latter aimed to simulate the effect of a hot metamorphic core complex or an alignment of uprising plutons bordered by a transtensional/transpressional strike-slip fault.\nThe preliminary results show that convergence angle significantly influences the overall geometry of the transpressive system with greater convergence angles resulting in wider fault zones and higher elevation. Different positions, densities and viscosities of weak rheological layers have not only different surface expressions but also affect the fault geometry in the subsurface. For instance, rheological weak material in the bottom layer results in stretching when experiment reaches a certain displacement and a buildup of a less segmented, wide positive flower structure. At the surface, a wide fault valley in the middle of the fault zone is the reflection of stretching along the velocity discontinuity at depth. In models with a thin and rheologically weaker layer in the middle of the brittle layer, deformation is distributed over more faults and the geometry of the fault zone below and above the weak zone shows significant differences. This latter experiment has significantly similar phenomena in reality, such as few pressure ridges along Altyn fault. The experimental results underline the need to understand the role of the convergence angle and the influence of rheology on fault evolution, in order to connect between surface deformation and subsurface geometry.",

Yet, there is a perceptible lag in the abilities of the research community to capitalize on these new possibilities, due to lacking the relevant skill-sets, especially with regards to multi-disciplinary and integrative investigations that involve active collaboration.\nUC Santa Barbara’s National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), and the University of North Carolina’s Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), were recipients of NSF OCI S2I2 “Conceptualization awards”, charged with helping define the needs of the research community relative to enabling science and education through “sustained software infrastructure”. Over the course of our activities, a consistent request from Earth scientists was for “better training in software that enables more effective, reproducible research.”\nThis community-based feedback led to creation of an “Open Science for Synthesis” Institute— a innovative, three-week, bi-coastal training program for early career researchers. We provided a mix of lectures, hands-on exercises, and working group experience on topics including: data discovery and preservation; code creation, management, sharing, and versioning; scientific workflow documentation and reproducibility; statistical and machine modeling techniques; virtual collaboration mechanisms; and methods for communicating scientific results. All technologies and quantitative tools presented were suitable for advancing open, collaborative, and reproducible synthesis research.\nIn this talk, we will report on the lessons learned from running this ambitious training program, that involved coordinating classrooms among two remote sites, and included developing original synthesis research activities as part of the course. We also report on the feedback provided by participants as to the learning approaches and topical issues they found most engaging, and why.",

            "abstract": "National legal, policy and decision-making frameworks often undervalue or ignore ecosystem services (ES) and the ways in which they can affect livelihoods, and research projects may under-estimate the role of governance in translating research effectively into practice. Better coordination of ES and livelihoods can be fatally undermined by existing institutional frameworks and through poor implementation and follow-up of policy decisions. This can have drastic impacts on resilience as the reality may be very different from the policy intentions.\nThe ESPA Deltas project integrates physical modelling, a multi-season social survey, scenario development and stakeholder engagement, and a governance analysis component has been incorporated into each. The project has comprehensively assessed the legal, policy and institutional context in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta in Bangladesh, identifying barriers to legal and policy implementation through intensive stakeholder engagement and desk study at local, national and international levels. There has been a high degree of agreement in the findings from each of these independent processes and across the districts assessed.\nThis presentation illustrates how the governance research has been incorporated into the development of qualitative scenarios. It also demonstrates the extent to which policy implementation considerations have been factored into the biophysical modelling and social survey work. It identifies the challenges for adaptation strategies in Bangladesh, and draws on successful examples of policy implementation there (e.g. disaster management) to propose governance interventions that might enhance the resilience of delta inhabitants, especially in the light of the informal governance context. This research facilitates implementation of targeted governance interventions and supports the development of tools that can aid policy-makers in evaluating the impact of policy decisions on ecosystem services and livelihoods.",

            "abstract": "The world's coastal deltaic wetlands are threatened by relative sea level rise. Protecting these ecosystems requires understanding deltaic growth and few studies have focused on how vegetation influences this growth. Here we explore the ecogeomorphic evolution of Wax Lake Delta (WLD) using a remote sensing database consisting of 1083 Landsat 5 and 7 images (30 m resolution) from 1983 to 2012 and 23 high-resolution images (1.5 m resolution) from 2001 to 2012. We calculate each Landsat image to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which indicates the relative above ground vegetation biomass. We also use the high-resolution images and spectral signatures from Landsat images to classify land cover into vegetation, sediment, and water. Only imagery from peak biomass season, August and September for this subtropical ecosystem, was analyzed to control for the effects of interannual variability in growing season and growth rates on the estimates of vegetated areas. Additional analyses of extreme events and fluctuating water levels is needed to correctly estimate land area and areal vegetation coverage. Our results show from 1984 to ~1995 WLD experiences a period of emergence where total delta area and the vegetated percent (at peak biomass) increases rapidly. After 1995, the vegetated percent of WLD levels off, but fluctuates from 70% to 90%. During winter months this value drops to ~10%. Accordingly, the bare sediment percent decreases as one minus the vegetated percent. At individual island scale vegetated percent at peak biomass levels off at different times and values. Proximal (or older) islands level off as soon as 1995, fluctuating from 80% to nearly 100% vegetated, while distal (or younger) islands do so at 2000 ranging from 20% to 80%. It is unclear why this difference occurs, but we conjecture it is caused by the lower elevation of the distal islands or their aggrading slower than proximal ones as the incoming sediment volume spreads over a larger deltaic area. Our analysis suggests that vegetation can most effectively enhance delta sedimentation if sediment delivery occurs during peak biomass season.",

            "abstract": "Sediment cores from Mountain Lake, a small natural lake in Presidio National Park, San Francisco, CA, provide a record of Bay Area environmental change spanning the past 2000 years, and of unusually high heavy metal contamination in the last century (Reidy 2001). In 2013, partial dredging of the lake removed the upper two meters of lake sediment as part of a remediation effort. Prior to dredging, long and short cores spatially covering the lake and representing deep and shallow environments were recovered from the lake to preserve the paleoenvironmental record of one of the only natural lakes on the San Francisco Peninsula. The cores are curated at LacCore and are available for research by the scientific community.\nMountain Lake formed in an interdunal depression and was shallow and fluctuating in its first few hundred years. Lake level rise and inundation of a larger area was followed by lowstands under drier conditions around 550-700 and 1300 CE. Nonnative taxa and cultivars appeared at the time of Spanish settlement in the late 18th century, and the lake underwent eutrophication due to livestock pasturing. U.S. Army landscaping introduced trees to the watershed in the late 19th century. The upper ~1m of sediments document unusually high heavy metal contamination, especially for lead and zinc, caused by the construction and heavy use of Highway 1 on the lake shore. Lead levels peak in 1975 and decline towards the surface, reflecting the history of leaded gasoline use in California. Zinc is derived mainly from automobile tires, and follows a pattern similar to that of lead, but continues to increase towards the surface.\nOngoing research includes additional radiocarbon dating and detailed lithological analysis to form the basis of lake-level reconstruction and archeological investigations. Because the Presidio archaeological record does not record human habitation in the area until approximately 1300 years before present, the core analysis also has the potential to determine whether people lived at the tip of the SF peninsula as early as 2000 BP.\nIn October 2014 the Presidio Trust opened a Heritage Gallery that interprets the cultural and natural history of the park for the public. The Mountain Lake sedimentary record is an important component of this exhibit, which includes an epoxy-embedded core from the lake.",

            "abstract": "The Earth science data management community has dedicated significant energy and technology towards improving the discoverability of the ever-growing wealth of scientific data. As we make strides towards this goal and more data sets are exposed in online catalogs, a new challenge emerges – how do users determine which data to use. Met with the wave of ever greater and more complex data, users must be able to differentiate between data sets and determine which are most useful and relevant to their applications. In response to this, the NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC) has been developing a data set search tool with researchers' needs and preferences in mind. Web metrics and usability studies have been used to answer the following questions:\n· How do users search for data?\n· Which data attributes are of primary importance when selecting a data set?\n· When similar data sets exist, how is one chosen over another?\nNSIDC DAAC has found that data set differentiation is driven by both what you present and how you present it. The “what” can range from relatively straightforward information such as the parameter measured or the spatial coverage to the more complex and nuanced such as data usage suggestions or data usage metrics. The “how” includes considerations such as making data set information scannable and comparable to tailoring relevance ranking algorithms to match user expectations. In this presentation, we will discuss the challenge of data differentiation, the strategies the NSIDC DAAC has employed with its search tool, and the opportunities available for assisting researchers in their data selection process.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon is not only an exceptionally biodiverse and carbon-rich tract of tropical forest, it is also a case study in land use change. Over the last 30 years, Amazonia has been home to extraordinary growth in agricultural production, in part from agricultural expansion, but also due to more intense management on Amazonia’s existing croplands. We use a year-long campaign and approximately 500 field chamber measurements to estimate how cropland intensification in Mato Grosso, Brazil affects the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil N dynamics. In this system, soybean cropland intensification occurs when double cropping is introduced, in which maize is planted directly after soybean harvest and fertilized twice with inorganic N. We find that dry season N2O emissions in single-cropped (soybean only) fields, double-cropped (soybean/maize) fields and reference tropical forest are uniformly near zero, or ~0-0.5 ngN/cm^2/hr. Surprisingly, wet season emissions rates remain low as well, between 1-4 ngN/cm^2/hr, for both cropland types and reference forest. By contrast, isolated post-fertilization spikes in N2O emissions are large, with a maximum increase of ~800% and a mean increase of ~400%, though these flux increases resolve rapidly and rates return to their low baseline within days. Finally, we explore the role that soil moisture, soil N availability, and soil C availability play in regulating N2O fluxes in reference forest, soybean fields and intensified soybean-maize fields. Open questions surround how the Amazon’s land resources can be leveraged to increase agricultural production at the least harm to the environment. Here, we quantify the consequences of land use change on N2O, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a critical ecosystem undergoing novel agricultural intensification. These results may inform both greenhouse gas accounting and our understanding of the effects of Amazonia’s changing agricultural landscape on the nitrogen cycle.",

            "abstract": "Detection of cyclical drivers of stratigraphic patterns aids in the reconstruction of paleoenvironments and the identification of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. Statistical analysis of lithofacies stacking patterns is a common approach, and often focuses on the question of whether the observed patterns can be distinguished from those generated by random processes, which offers the potential of extrapolation into a predictive framework. The observed sedimentary record can be fragmented by a variety of issues, such as covered sections in outcrop, broken sections on cores, dolomitization, or recording errors from geophysical equipment. This missing data represents unobserved time in the record, and understanding how this missing time affects our observations can enhance our ability to reconstruct a basin’s history. Synthetic stratigraphic sections of known history are generated by Dougal, a previously developed 1-D carbonate forward numeric model, and used to explore the effects of cover, or fragmentation of the record, in the analysis of observed stratigraphic sections. Each synthetic stratigraphic section is covered in increments of 5% of the total thickness, and examined under a variety of styles ranging from a singular thick to numerous thin intervals. Covered intervals are distributed as clustered or evenly spaced across the whole stratigraphic section. Results indicate a general decrease in the degree of observed order in the stratigraphic columns as the proportion of cover increases. Within each increment, the style with a singular thick covered interval demonstrated the lowest degree of order, and the stratigraphic sections with two evenly spaced and equally thick covered intervals demonstrated the highest order. These results show how the proportional quantity and distribution of missing data can affect the identification of ordered patterns in the rock record. This work can provide guidelines for the analysis of covered intervals in stratigraphic sections.",

            "abstract": "The ability to accurately predict water availability in the cities surrounding Lake Michigan-Huron becomes particularly difficult when the uncertain effects of climate change, such as changes in precipitation patterns and evaporation rates, are considered. Lake level reconstructions provide useful model inputs to better predict this availability. Annual tree-ring widths have been successfully utilized in reconstructions of lake levels in the Great Lakes region via the creation of proxy datasets of temperature and precipitation that are then input into a multilinear regression model to reconstruct annual average lake level. Here, the combination of this approach with analysis of instrumental records of precipitation and stream flow input allows for a more comprehensive understanding of regional hydroclimate and improved projection of future water resource availability. Annual tree-ring widths of cores collected from four old-growth forests near southern Lake Michigan were combined with over 30 archived tree-ring width chronologies from the Great Lakes region and used to create proxy datasets of temperature and precipitation. A multilinear regression model related these proxy variables to Lake Michigan-Huron lake level and stream flow of the Saint Clair River, which flows into Lake Michigan-Huron, for the period of available instrumental record (1860-present). When possible, the available tree-ring widths were used to reconstruct these variables for years prior to the instrumental record. Timing and severity of rainfall events were also analyzed to identify spatial and temporal patterns and their variability over time. The combination of updated tree-ring width chronologies, chronologies from newly sampled sites, and instrumental records of various indicators of water availability provides novel and valuable insight into the future lake level of Lake Michigan-Huron.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience education and public outreach efforts (EPO), both formal and informal, are critical to increasing science literacy amongst members of the public and securing the next generation of geoscientists. At UCLA, the Institute for Planets and Exoplanets (iPLEX) has developed a multifaceted program to administer meaningful and original hands-on education and outreach to the public, teachers/professors, and students. To build the program, we first developed a virtual “home base” using Wordpress. With the needs of our community in mind, we structured the website to serve three categories of individuals: the public, teachers/professors, and volunteers. To serve the public, we have developed a series of informal education events (e.g., Exploring Your Universe) that bring thousands of science enthusiasts to campus. For those unable to participate in hands-on demonstrations or for those who would like to see them again, informational videos were developed and made available on our online Physical Demonstrations Digital Library (PDDL). The PDDL contains a second set of videos that are tutorial in nature and specifically designed with teachers, TAs and professors in mind. In addition, we have produced a publicly available annual newsletter written at the level of the informed public that details exciting and current planetary research at UCLA. Another facet of the program, designed with teachers in mind is our application-based private outreach event system in which teachers may choose to have volunteers come to their school with interactive demos or to come to UCLA to speak with scientists and tour laboratories. The final branch of the iPLEX EPO and education program caters to volunteers and includes an online “hub” where volunteers can register for events, download demonstration information packets, and discuss tips with other volunteers. We have recently developed a “Science Education, Outreach, and Communication” course to be integrated into UCLA’s undergraduate geology curriculum that will serve twofold to train new volunteers and educate young scientists on how to communicate their field to the public. Feedback from participants indicates an overall increase in geoscience EPO participation and satisfaction from the public, teachers, and volunteers alike since iPLEX’s program was emplaced.",

SWOT will produce the first global survey of Earth's surface water by measuring sea surface height and the heights, slopes, and inundated areas of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. These coastal, lake and river measurements will be useful for monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and climate impacts of a changing environment.\nNASA and their French, Canadian and the United Kingdom space agency partners are developing new wide swath altimetry technology that will cover most of the world’s ocean and surface freshwater bodies, and will have the capability to make observations with unprecedented resolution compared to existing technologies and will have the capability of measuring how water bodies change over time.\nAlong with existing altimetry datasets, simulated SWOT data sets are being planned to assess the quality and potential value of anticipated SWOT measurements to both oceanography and hydrology applications. With the surface water measurements anticipated from SWOT, a broad range of applications may inform coastal managers and marine operators of offshore conditions and currents relevant to their regions. One study proposed to the NASA ASP would highlight coastal and estuary applications potential of the future SWOT mission. This study would promote the use of remote sensing measurements to improve the understanding, monitoring and management of estuaries and deltas for a broad range of users. In addition, the AirSWOT airborne mission to demonstrate the wide swath technology of SWOT is providing preliminary data products in inland and coastal regions that may be useful for early assessment by users of the future value of SWOT.\nNASA's Applied Sciences Program (ASP), along with the international SWOT project teams, is supporting a program that promotes applications research and engages a broad community of potential SWOT data users. The applied science community would be a key element in a successful SWOT mission, demonstrating the high value of NASA’s missions and the utility of science and data products in addressing societal issues and needs.",

We are developing a lightning fast Big Data technology called SciSpark based on ApacheTM Spark. Spark implements the map-reduce paradigm for parallel computing on a cluster, but emphasizes in-memory computation, “spilling” to disk only as needed, and so outperforms the disk-based ApacheTM Hadoop by 100x in memory and by 10x on disk, and makes iterative algorithms feasible.\nSciSpark will enable scalable model evaluation by executing large-scale comparisons of A-Train satellite observations to model grids on a cluster of 100 to 1000 compute nodes. This 2nd generation capability for NASA’s Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) will compute simple climate metrics at interactive speeds, and extend to quite sophisticated iterative algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) based clustering of temperature PDFs, and even graph-based algorithms for searching for Mesocale Convective Complexes.\nThe goals of SciSpark are to: (1) Decrease the time to compute comparison statistics and plots from minutes to seconds; (2) Allow for interactive exploration of time-series properties over seasons and years; (3) Decrease the time for satellite data ingestion into RCMES to hours; (4) Allow for Level-2 comparisons with higher-order statistics or PDF’s in minutes to hours; and (5) Move RCMES into a near real time decision-making platform.\nWe will report on: the architecture and design of SciSpark, our efforts to integrate climate science algorithms in Python and Scala, parallel ingest and partitioning (sharding) of A-Train satellite observations from HDF files and model grids from netCDF files, first parallel runs to compute comparison statistics and PDF’s, and first metrics quantifying parallel speedups and memory & disk usage.",

            "abstract": "The low-lying, coastal region of Bangladesh has relied on poldering (the creation of embanked islands) since the 1960s to mitigate the effects of tidal inundation and storm surge from tropical cyclones. The result has been an increase in total arable land and the ability to sustain food production for one of the most densely populated countries in the world. However, poldering has had the unintended consequences of starving embanked landscapes of sediment and increasing high water levels through tidal amplification. Thus, polder elevations have been declining while tidal channels have been aggrading. Recent small-scale engineering projects, locally referred to as tidal river management (TRM), have attempted to combat these effects by allowing water and sediment exchange between the polders and the tidal network. Anecdotal reports claim great success for TRM in some locations, but not in others. However, to date there has been almost no quantitative analysis.\nHere, we used measured sedimentation rates and water level data from Polder 32 (P32) and the adjacent pristine mangrove forest in southwest Bangladesh to parameterize a simple model of tidal inundation and resultant sediment accretion. P32 elevations are currently ~1 m lower than natural elevations resulting in ~105 cm of tidal inundation when embankments were breached versus only ~20 cm for the mangrove forest. We measured sedimentation rates of 20 cm/yr and 1 cm/yr, respectively. When normalized to the cumulative annual flooding depth, the resulting sediment extraction rates yield similar values of 300 mg/L and 230 mg/L. We employ these flooding depth and sediment extraction parameters in our model to quantify the amount of time and sediment needed to re-equilibrate the lowered polder elevation to that of the natural environment.\nAlthough relatively simple, results from this preliminary model corroborate anecdotes of TRM’s effectiveness at restoring land-surface elevations in the polders of Bangladesh. Future work will add spatial variation and possibly integrate human actions with agent-based models.",

            "abstract": "Research undertaken by the New England Sustainability Consortium includes use of multi-scale elevation data ranging from one arc-second (~30m) NED to two-meter LiDAR for delineation and subsequent characterization of watersheds draining to the Gulf of Maine. Watersheds within the study area range from the Penobscot River (drainage area > 22,000 km2) to small coastal streams with drainage basins <1km2. The research seeks to relate fresh water flows to water quality conditions within bathing beaches and shellfish harvesting areas along the Maine coast.\nAlthough spatial analysts typically pursue topographic data with the highest available resolution, use of multi-scale elevation data is necessary in regions where datasets are created from different survey methods. The sizes of the watersheds draining to the Gulf of Maine vary substantially, with several large interior-reaching watersheds dwarfing most of the coastal basins. An elevation raster at a two meter grid size can produce large file sizes and long processing times, presenting cost-benefit considerations due to the relatively low level of detail necessary for comparison of the largest watersheds to the rest of the study basins. Our watershed delineation method involves a multi-step approach to capture the inland portions of large watersheds using 10m and 30m USGS DEMs, while maintaining use of two-meter coastal LiDAR to accurately delineate the small coastal basins.\nOur delineated watersheds are parameterized based on multiple geomorphological and land use characteristics to facilitate evaluation of the relation between watershed and coastal water quality conditions at monitoring stations along the Maine coast. Landscape characteristics under consideration include watershed size (drainage area), surface drainage network density, soil drainage, vegetation cover, and impervious surface area.",

The recent rise in water temperatures, drop in water quality, depletion of fish stocks has raised concerns over the future state of these lakes. This study takes the “social-ecological systems” view of Maine lakes with focus on climate-induced shifts in the ice-cover duration. The resulting re-adjustments in the nutrient load assimilation, decrease in lake water quantity, increased radiative heating on phytoplankton productivity and economic and other losses to the community due to cancellation of winter recreation opportunities have the potential to reshape this vulnerable system.",

            "abstract": "Recent work shows that after a high severity forest fire, approximately 60% more solar radiation reaches the snow surface due to the reduction in canopy density. Also, significant amounts of black carbon (BC) particles and larger burned woody debris (BWD) are shed from standing charred trees, which concentrate on the snowpack, darken its surface, and reduce snow albedo by 50% during ablation. The postfire forest environment drives a substantial increase in net shortwave radiation at the snowpack surface, driving earlier and more rapid melt, however hydrologic models do not explicitly incorporate forest fire disturbance effects to snowpack dynamics. In this study we characterized, parameterized, and validated the postfire snow albedo effect: how the deposition and concentration of charred forest debris decreases snow albedo, increases snow albedo decay rates, and drives an earlier date of snow disappearance. For three study sites in the Oregon High Cascade Mountains, a 2-yr old burned forest, a 10-yr burned forest, and a nearby unburned forest, we used a suite of empirical data to characterize the magnitude and duration of the postfire effect to snow albedo decay. For WY 2012, WY2013, and WY2014 we conducted spectral albedo measurements, snow surface sampling, in-situ snow and meteorological monitoring, and snow energy balance modeling. From these data we developed a new parameterization which represents the postfire effect to snow albedo decay as a function of days-since-snowfall. We validated our parameterization using a physically-based, spatially-distributed snow accumulation and melt model, in-situ snow monitoring, net snowpack radiation, and remote sensing data. We modeled snow dynamics across the extent of all burned area in the headwaters of the McKenzie River Basin and validated the watershed-scale implications of the postfire snow albedo effect using in-situ micrometeorological and remote sensing data. This research quantified the watershed scale postfire effects to snow albedo and snow melt in the Oregon High Cascades, and provided a new parameterization of forest fire effects to high elevation winter water storage.",

            "abstract": "The recent PCAST report (2012), Engage to Excel, calls for a major shift in instructional modes in introductory (geo)science courses by “replacing standard laboratory courses with discovery-based research courses”. An increased emphasis is recommended to engage students in experiments with the possibility of true discovery and expanded use of scientific research courses in the first two years. To address this challenge, the On the Cutting Edge program convened a workshop of geoscience faculty to explore the many ways that true research experiences can be built into introductory geoscience courses. The workshop goals included: consideration of the opportunities, strategies and methods used to provide research experiences for students in lower division geoscience courses; examination of ways to develop students’ “geoscience habits of mind” through participation in authentic research activities; exploration of ways that student research projects can be designed to contribute to public science literacy with applications to a range of issues facing humanity; and development of strategies to obtain funding for these research projects, to make these programs sustainable in departments and institutions, and to scale-up these programs so that all students may participate. Access to Earth data, information technology, lab and field-based instrumentation, and field experiences provide unprecedented opportunities for students to engage in authentic research at early stages in their careers. Early exposure to research experiences has proven to be effective in the recruitment of students to the geoscience disciplines, improved retention and persistence in degree programs, motivation for students to learn and increase self-efficacy, improved attitudes and values about science, and overall increased student success. Workshop outcomes include an online collection of tested research projects currently being used in geoscience classes, resources related to effective design, implementation and assessment of student research projects, and all workshop activities are posted on the website:\nhttp://serc.carleton.edu/74960",

            "abstract": "The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) provides instruments for creating and operating seismic arrays at a wide range of scales. As an example, for over thirty years the IRIS PASSCAL program has provided instruments to individual Principal Investigators to deploy arrays of all shapes and sizes on every continent. These arrays have ranged from just a few sensors to hundreds or even thousands of sensors, covering areas with dimensions of meters to thousands of kilometers. IRIS also operates arrays directly, such as the USArray Transportable Array (TA) as part of the EarthScope program. Since 2004, the TA has rolled across North America, at any given time spanning a swath of approximately 800 km by 2,500 km, and thus far sampling 2% of the Earth’s surface. This achievement includes all of the lower-48 U.S., southernmost Canada, and now parts of Alaska. IRIS has also facilitated specialized arrays in polar environments and on the seafloor. In all cases, the data from these arrays are freely available to the scientific community. As the community of scientists who use IRIS facilities and data look to the future they have identified a clear need for new array capabilities. In particular, as part of its Wavefields Initiative, IRIS is exploring new technologies that can enable large, dense array deployments to record unaliased wavefields at a wide range of frequencies. Large-scale arrays might utilize multiple sensor technologies to best achieve observing objectives and optimize equipment and logistical costs. Improvements in packaging and power systems can provide equipment with reduced size, weight, and power that will reduce logistical constraints for large experiments, and can make a critical difference for deployments in harsh environments or other situations where rapid deployment is required. We will review the range of existing IRIS array capabilities with an overview of previous and current deployments and examples of data and results. We will review existing IRIS projects that explore new array capabilities and highlight future directions for IRIS instrumentation facilities.",

            "abstract": "For the last century, the island of Maui, Hawaii, has been the center of environmental, agricultural, and legal conflict with respect to surface and groundwater allocation. Planning for adequate future freshwater resources requires flexible and adaptive policies that emphasize partnerships and knowledge transfer between scientists and non-scientists. In 2012 the Hawai‘i state legislature passed the Climate Change Adaptation Priority Guidelines (Act 286) law requiring county and state policy makers to include island-wide climate change scenarios in their planning processes. This research details the ongoing work by researchers in the NOAA funded Pacific RISA to support the development of Hawaii’s first island-wide water use plan under the new climate adaptation directive.\nThis integrated project combines several models with participatory future scenario planning. The dynamically downscaled triply nested Hawaii Regional Climate Model (HRCM) was modified from the WRF community model and calibrated to simulate the many microclimates on the Hawaiian archipelago. For the island of Maui, the HRCM was validated using 20 years of hindcast data, and daily projections were created at a 1 km scale to capture the steep topography and diverse rainfall regimes. Downscaled climate data are input into a USGS hydrological model to quantify groundwater recharge. This model was previously used for groundwater management, and is being expanded utilizing future climate projections, current land use maps and future scenario maps informed by stakeholder input.\nParticipatory scenario planning began in 2012 to bring together a diverse group of over 50 decision-makers in government, conservation, and agriculture to 1) determine the type of information they would find helpful in planning for climate change, and 2) develop a set of scenarios that represent alternative climate/management futures. This is an iterative process, resulting in flexible and transparent narratives at multiple scales. The resulting climate, land use, and groundwater recharge maps give stakeholders a common set of future scenarios that they understand through the participatory scenario process, and identify the vulnerabilities, trade-offs, and adaptive priorities for different groundwater management and land uses in an uncertain future.",

Current programs include two mentoring partnerships: pairing scientist-mentors with at-risk youth at the Pittsburg Community School in Pittsburg CA, and pairing scientist-mentors with families from the Kyrene del Cielo Elementary School in Chandler AZ. These programs represent two very different models for utilizing the virtual media platform provided by SAGANet.org to engage K-12 students and their families in STEM. For the former, scientists mentor the students of the Pittsburg School as part of the formal in-class curriculum. For the latter, scientists work with K-5 students and their families through Cielo’s Science & Engineering Discovery Room to develop a science project as part of an informal learning experience that is independent of the formal curriculum. In this presentation, we (1) discuss the challenges and successes of engaging these two distinct audiences through virtual media, (2) present the results of how these two very-different mentoring partnership impact K-12 students science self-efficacy, interest in science, and STEM career awareness, and (3) share the impact of the mentoring experience on the mentor’s confidence and self-efficacy with communicating science to the public.",

Multiple issues are covered, including complex concerns like the construction of general circulation models, carbon pricing schemes in various countries, and adaptation approaches in the face of extreme weather events. Clips will be shown in the presentation. The first course (Climate Science Basics) has now been seen by over two hundred thousand individuals in over 80 countries, despite being offered in English only. Each course takes about two hours to work through, and in recognizing that that duration might pose an attention barrier to some students, PICS selected a number of short clips from the climate-science course and posted them as independent snippets on YouTube. A companion series of YouTube videos entitled, “Clear The Air”, was created to confront the major global-warming denier myths.

            "abstract": "Advances in sensor-driven computation and computationally steered sensing will greatly enable future research in fields including environmental and atmospheric sciences. We will present “Waggle,” an open-source hardware and software infrastructure developed with two goals: (1) reducing the separation and latency between sensing and computing and (2) improving the reliability and longevity of sensing-actuation platforms in challenging and costly deployments. Inspired by “deep-space probe” systems, the Waggle platform design includes features that can support longitudinal studies, deployments with varying communication links, and remote management capabilities. Waggle lowers the barrier for scientists to incorporate real-time data from their sensors into their computations and to manipulate the sensors or provide feedback through actuators. A standardized software and hardware design allows quick addition of new sensors/actuators and associated software in the nodes and enables them to be coupled with computational codes both insitu and on external compute infrastructure. The Waggle framework currently drives the deployment of two observational systems – a portable and self-sufficient weather platform for study of small-scale effects in Chicago's urban core and an open-ended distributed instrument in Chicago that aims to support several research pursuits across a broad range of disciplines including urban planning, microbiology and computer science. Built around open-source software, hardware, and Linux OS, the Waggle system comprises two components – the Waggle field-node and Waggle cloud-computing infrastructure. Waggle field-node affords a modular, scalable, fault-tolerant, secure, and extensible platform for hosting sensors and actuators in the field. It supports insitu computation and data storage, and integration with cloud-computing infrastructure. The Waggle cloud infrastructure is designed with the goal of scaling to several hundreds of thousands of Waggle nodes. It supports aggregating data from sensors hosted by the nodes, staging computation, relaying feedback to the nodes and serving data to end-users. We will discuss the Waggle design principles and their applicability to various observational research pursuits, and demonstrate its capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to affect the integrity of forested ecosystems worldwide. One forest type expected to be severely impacted is the eastern spruce-fir forest, because it is already at the extreme elevational and latitudinal limits of its range within the northern United States. Large-scale bioclimactic models predict declining habitat suitability for spruce and fir species, while causing drought and thermal stress on remnant trees. As rising temperatures reduce or eliminate habitat throughout much of the current spruce-fir range, growth and regeneration of hardwood forests or more southerly conifers will be favored.\nThe ecotone between northern hardwood forests and montane boreal forests was recently reported to have shifted approximately 100 m upslope over the last 20-40 years in the Green Mountains of Vermont, U.S.A. The research behind this finding relied on long-term forest plot data and change analysis of narrow transects (6 m width) on aerial photos and SPOT imagery. In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, U.S.A., research using vegetation indices from Landsat data reported a conflicting finding; that coniferous vegetation was increasing downslope of the existing ecotone. We carefully matched and topographically corrected Landsat images from 1989 through 2011 to comprehensively map the boreal-temperate forest ecotone throughout the Green Mountains in Vermont, U.S.A. We used edge detection and linear mixed models to evaluate whether the ecotone changed in elevation over 20 years, and whether rates of change varied with Latitude or aspect.\nWe found that the elevation of the boreal-temperate forest ecotone, and changes in its location over 20 years, were more variable than reported in recent studies. While the ecotone moved to higher elevations in some locations at reported rates, these rates were at the tales of the distribution of elevational change. Other locations showed downward movement of the ecotone, while for the majority of sites, no change was detected. The large variability in both the rate and direction of elevational change of the boreal-temperate forest ecotone suggests that current changes cannot be attributed clearly to climate change, but may equally reflect forest dynamics of older forests senescing and being replaced locally by competing species.",

            "abstract": "Helene, the Saturnian L4 Trojan satellite co-orbiting Dionne and sitting within the E-ring, possesses an unusual morphology characteristic of broad km-scale basins and depressions and a generally smooth surface patterned with streaks and grooves which are indicative of non-typical mass transport. Elevation angles do not appear to exceed 10o at most. The nature and origin of the surface materials forming these grooved patterns is unknown. Given the low surface gravity (<5mm/s2), it hard to imagine how such transport features can come about with such low grades and surface gravities. Preliminary examinations of classical linear and nonlinear mass wasting mechanisms do not appear to reproduce these curious features. A suite of hypothesis that we examine is the possibility that the fine grain material on the surface has been either (i) accreted or (ii) generated as refractory detritus resulting from sublimation of the icy bedrock, and that these materials subsequently mass-waste like a non-Newtonian highly non-linear creeping flow. Modifying the landform evolution model MARSSIM to handle two new mass-wasting mechanism, the first due to glacial-like flow via Glen's Law and the second due to plastic-like flow like a Bingham fluid, we setup and test a number of likely scenarios to explain the observations. The numerical results qualitatively indicate that treating the mass-wasting materials as a Bingham material reproduces many of the qualitative features observed. We also find that in those simulations in which accretion is concomitant with Bingham mass-wasting, the long time-evolution of the surface flow shows intermittency in the total surface activity (defined as total surface integral of the absolute magnitude of the mass-flux). Detailed analyses identify the locations where this activity is most pronounced and we will discuss these and its implications in further detail.",

How will we answer?” Results of the interviews indicate that 90% of these leaders are concerned about climate change, more than 50% are already doing something about the impacts, and the majority of them want more information, greater dialogue and examples of actions taken by other community leaders. We found that repeated engagement of leaders at the San Diego County Water Authority went from basic collaboration in our water tours, to greater participation of their top leaders in a water tour for top decision makers from the City of San Diego, finally culminating with full support of and participation in the 2050 report. The 2050 report represents an integrated approach blending local climate change science, social science education theory and presentation of a suite of solution-driven opportunities for local leaders. The report includes science infographics that illustrate rigorous scientific facts, statements from expert scientists and direct quotes from decision makers, and examples of successful climate change adaptation actions from companies, government groups and others. The video and photography sessions for the 2050 report led to many unexpected discussion among leaders with differing opinions on climate change, greater enthusiasm to participate in outreach activities with other leaders and an increased willingness to share their successes publicly. Climate Education Partners is finding that linking excellent local science with healthy community dialogue is resulting in San Diego leaders and their communities making more informed decisions on how to adapt to climate change now and for all future generations.",

            "abstract": "Public perception of risk is key in pre-disaster preparation. Despite admonitions from emergency planners, people often fail to take reasonable precautions. But if emergency planners also fail to realize the possibility of a particular disaster scenario, there is very little chance that the public will plan for it. In Southern California there is a well-known risk associated with earthquakes, and it would be difficult to find anyone that didn't understand that the region was subject to risk from earthquakes. On the other hand, few, if any people consider the risk associated with tropical storms or hurricanes. This is reasonable considering people have always been told that the west coast of the United States is immune from hurricanes due to the cold water associated with the California Current, and the hazard of earthquakes is fairly obvious to anyone that has lived the for a while. Such an attitude is probably justifiable for most of Southern California, but it's unclear whether this is true for the San Diego region: destructive earthquakes are historically rare, and there is good evidence that the region was affected by a Category 1 hurricane in 1858. Indeed, during the last 70 years, more people have died from tropical cyclones in Calfornia's southernmost counties (San Diego and Imperial) than have died from earthquakes. In this paper we compare the relative risks from these two different types of disasters for the San Diego region, and attempt to answer why one type of hazard is emphasized in public planning and the other is neglected.",

            "abstract": "The snowpack of the Sierra Nevada plays an important role as a natural reservoir for the surrounding region, storing water during the wet season and releasing it later in the year. Changes to the snowpack between the 1981-2000 and 2081-2100 periods are investigated using dynamical downscaling with WRF v3.2 coupled to the NOAH-MP land surface model, at 3km resolution. First, a baseline run is performed in which WRF is forced by North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for the 1981-2000 period. Based on a comparison between this baseline simulation and station data from the California Department of Water Resources, WRF is shown to have high model skill in reproducing snow water equivalent (SWE) variability. Next, five future runs are performed in order to simulate how that same baseline period would transpire if the mean climate were altered to reflect the climate change signal found in five CMIP5 GCMs. All five runs show an overall decline in April 1st SWE, but some runs show increased SWE at high elevations. SWE changes are influenced by competing factors including reduced precipitation falling as snow, increased total precipitation, and enhanced melting. Snow at lower elevations is highly temperature sensitive, so lower elevations experience higher fractional SWE losses. Meanwhile, higher elevations may still be below freezing under a warmer climate, so increased precipitation can lead to increased snowfall. The largest SWE losses occur at intermediate elevations that are cold enough to maintain moderate SWE levels during the baseline, but are still sensitive to temperature changes.",

            "abstract": "Fires in wetlands can move into organic soils, where the resulting ground fires can smolder and consume large amounts of soil. These long-duration fires have a number of negative effects including air quality and motorist safety, as well as large-scale implications resulting from their release of large quantities of stored carbon. However, the ecological implications of the frequency and intensity of organic soil combustion occurrence are relatively unexplored. Smoldering fires in organic soils may increase local hydroperiod and wetland storage by lowering elevation, conferring benefits to wildlife (e.g., dry season refugia and feeding grounds). Short-term increases in productivity due to nutrient availability from ash may occur in or adjacent to areas affected by ground fires. Short-term negative feedbacks to fire return period are also likely to occur locally, due to increased hydroperiods; however, adjacent uplands may experience hydrologic changes as well, including factors which may affect fire risk far from areas of organic soil consumption. To explore hydrologic implications of soil-consuming ground fires, we developed a model based on a low-relief region in southern Florida (U.S.A.) that is characterized by seasonal hydrologic fluctuations and areas of organic soil distributed across a landscape that experiences frequent fire (i.e., 2-4 year return interval in uplands adjacent to wetlands). Parameterizing the model with local soil and hydrologic properties, as well as observed effects of fire in the region’s organic soils, the model predicts changes to wetland depths, bathymetry, and storage competence as a function of fire severity (i.e., area and depth of burn) that may be ecologically significant. Our findings imply that soil-consuming ground fires—and their prevention—have ecohydrological implications that must be considered when developing ecosystem and fire management protocols.",

To remedy this gap in our knowledge of basic core dynamics, we have designed and fabricated a large-scale rotating convection device at UCLA that can access Re ~ 105 at Ro ~ 10-2. We will be able to make precise measurements of heat transfer and flow velocities while acquiring high-resolution imaging of the large-scale flow fields. In addition, a newly developed rotating convection code has been designed specifically to make detailed comparisons with laboratory and theoretical results.

These couplings show rapid particle acceleration over a broad longitudinal extent (∼ 80 degrees) resulting from the pile-up of magnetic flux in the compression regions and their subsequent expansion. The challenge for forming large SEP events in such compression-acceleration scenarios is to have enhanced scattering within the acceleration region while also allowing for efficient escape of accelerated particles downstream (away from the Sun) from the compression region. We present here the most recent simulation results including energetic particle and CME plasma profiles, the subsequent flux and dosages at 1AU, and an analysis of the compressional regions as efficient accelerators.",

            "abstract": "The problem of developing mobile oceanographic and atmospheric observation networks (MOAO) with coordinated air and ocean vehicles is discussed in the framework of the communications and control software tool chain developed at Underwater Systems and Technologies Laboratory (LSTS) from Porto University. This is done with reference to field experiments to illustrate key capabilities and to assess future MOAO operations. First, the motivation for building MOAO by “composition” of air and ocean vehicles, communication networks, and planning and execution control frameworks is discussed – in networked vehicle systems information and commands are exchanged among multiple vehicles and operators, and the roles, relative positions, and dependencies of these vehicles and operators change during operations. Second, the planning and execution control framework developed at LSTS for multi-vehicle systems is discussed with reference to key concepts such as autonomy, mixed-initiative interactions, and layered organization. Third, the LSTS tool software tool chain is presented to show how to develop MOAO by composition. The tool chain comprises the Neptus command and control framework for mixed initiative interactions, the underlying IMC messaging protocol, and the DUNE on-board software. Fourth, selected LSTS operational deployments illustrate MOAO capability building. In 2012 we demonstrated the use of UAS to “ferry” data from UUVs located beyond line of sight (BLOS). In 2013 we demonstrated coordinated observations of coastal fronts with small UAS and UUVs, “bent” BLOS through the use of UAS as communication relays, and UAS tracking of juvenile hammer-head sharks. In 2014 we demonstrated UUV adaptive sampling with the closed loop controller of the UUV residing on a UAS; this was done with the help of a Wave Glider ASV with a communications gateway. The results from these experiments provide a background for assessing potential future UAS operations in a compositional MOAO.",

            "abstract": "A challenge facing STEM graduate students is the daunting task of communicating their research to a non-specialist audience. Strategies that work well in lab group meetings, such as using acronyms and jargon, do not work in the real world. Ideally, scientists should directly connect with any audience, responding spontaneously and actively, distilling their messages into conversational morsels that resonate with that audience. Scientists should listen.\nThis presentation highlights a 10-week, interdisciplinary graduate course at Dartmouth College that teaches methods for communicating science with clarity, vividness, and emotion. The course was developed in partnership with Stony Brook University’s Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, and emphasizes story-telling, two-way communication, active listening, and so much more. Effective message development and communication skills – spontaneity, authenticity, and connectivity – are honed through improvisational theater exercises.\nOne might ask, “why improv?” As a co-developer/co-instructor of this graduate course and a Ph.D. candidate in Earth Sciences, my response is, “why not improv?” Improv is acting without a script. It is also underground rap battles, baking from scratch, and playing jazz flute. Improv is Macguyver. Improv is not any one particular thing so much as it is a process through which we do things. Improv can teach us a lot: how to play, how to feel comfortable and present even while flailing, and how to truly listen.",

The module explores the interactions between global sea level rise, Greenland ice mass loss, and the response of the solid earth. It brings together topics typically addressed in introductory Earth science courses (isostatic rebound, geologic measurements, and climate change) in a way that highlights the interconnectivity of the Earth system and the interpretation of geodetic data.\nOur module has two over-arching goals: 1) for students to interpret geodetic data to assess spatial patterns and causes of mass loss, and 2) for students to evaluate the impact of ice sheet mass change on global and regional sea level and consider societal implications of ice sheet mass and sea level changes. We’ve developed four teaching units that focus on different components of these goals. In each unit, students analyze geodetic data and are guided through a series of questions to encourage their understanding of sea level rise and data interpretation.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that groundwater pumping affects surface-water availability by intercepting groundwater that would otherwise discharge to streams and/or by increasing seepage from surface-water channels. Conversely, surface-water management operations effect groundwater availability by altering the timing, location, and quantity of groundwater recharge and demand. Successful conjunctive use may require analysis with an integrated approach that accounts for the many interactions and feedbacks between surface-water and groundwater availability and their joint management.\nIn order to improve simulation and analysis of conjunctive use, Bureau of Reclamation and USGS are collaborating to develop a surface-water operations module within MODFLOW One Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MF-OWHM), a new version of the USGS Modular Groundwater Flow Model (MODFLOW). Here we describe the development and application of the surface-water operations module. We provide an overview of the conceptual approach used to simulate surface-water operations—including surface-water storage, allocation, release, diversion, and delivery on monthly to seasonal time frames—in a fully-integrated manner. We then present results from a recent case study analysis of the Rio Grande Project, a large-scale irrigation project located in New Mexico and Texas, under varying surface-water operations criteria and climate conditions. Case study results demonstrate the importance of integrated hydrologic simulation of surface water and groundwater operations in analysis and management of conjunctive-use systems.",

            "abstract": "Mangroves have the highest carbon stocks amongst tropical forests. In Mexico, however, little is known about their potential to mitigate climate change. In this work, we estimated biomass carbon stocks in the Southern Mexican Pacific Coast (~69,000 ha). We quantified above and belowground biomass carbon stocks at (1) the regional scale along two environmental strata (i.e. dry and wet), and (2) at the local scale along three geomorphological types of mangroves (i.e. fringe, estuarine and basin). Regional strata were defined using intensity and influence of rivers and, the mean annual precipitation and evapotranspiration ratio (i.e., wet < 1 > dry). By lowering the stressing environmental conditions (e.g., low salinity and high sediment accumulation), we expected the highest stocks in mangroves growing in wet and estuarine strata at the regional scale and local scale, respectively. Quantifications were carried out in sixty-six sites chosen through stratified randomized design in which six strata were obtained by a full combination of regional and local strata. In all strata, aboveground carbon represents 64-67% of total carbon. Total biomass carbon was higher in wet than dry stratum (W: 87.3 ± 6.9, D: 47.0 ± 5.0, p<0.001). While at local scale, total biomass carbon was high in estuarine mangroves of both wet and dry regions (W: 91.6 ± 7.8, D: 77.6 ± 14.8, p<0.001), and these were statistically similar to fringe wet mangroves (110.9 ± 24.2, p<0.001), the stratum with the highest total carbon. Following a conservative approach, the Mexican Southern Pacific Coast is storing near 20,344 Gg CO2e. If the historical annual deforestation rate of 0.54% continues, this region could emit between 0.03 and 14.4 Gg of CO2e ha/year, out of which wet estuarine mangroves would have the highest emission values. Evidence suggests that these mangroves are the most important strata in which REDD+ mechanisms could be implemented due to (1) their carbon stocks, and (2) their highest deforestation threat in the region as a result of commercial agriculture. Strategies for conservation and enhancement of carbon stocks in these mangroves require strengthened links between carbon and economic benefits that ecosystems provide.",

Amateur astronomers will provide images in 2015 and 2016, as the spacecraft approaches Jupiter, to be used for planning purposes, and also during the mission to provide context for JunoCam’s high-resolution pictures. Targeted imaging of specific features would enhance science value, but the dynamic nature of the jovian atmosphere makes this almost completely dependent on ground-based observations. The public will be involved in the decision of which images to acquire in each perijove pass. Partnership with the amateur image processing community will be essential for processing images during the Juno mission. This piece of the virtual team plan was successfully carried out as Juno executed its earth flyby gravity assist in 2013.

            "abstract": "Las Vegas, Nevada, with 2 million residents and 40 million annual visitors, is one of the driest metropolitan environments of its size in the world. The metro imports nearly all of its resources, including energy, water and food. Rapid population increases, drought, and temperature increases due to climate change create challenges for planning resilient systems in the Las Vegas Valley.\nBecause of its growth rate, aridity, Las Vegas, Nevada is a significant and relevant region for the study of the water, energy, food and climate nexus. Cities in the United States and the world are seeing increasing trends in urbanization and water scarcity. How does the water-energy-climate-food nexus affect each metropolitan area? How can this complex information be used for resiliency planning? How can it be related to the public, so they can understand the issues in a way that makes them meaningful participants in the planning process?\nThe topic of our presentation is a ‘resiliency atlas.’ The atlas is a place-based model tested in Las Vegas to explore bioregional distinctiveness of the water-energy-climate-food nexus, including regional transportation systems. The atlas integrates the systems within a utilitarian organization of information. Systems in this place-based model demonstrate how infrastructure services are efficiently provided for the Las Vegas Valley population.\nThis resiliency atlas can clarify how the nexus applies to place; and how it can be used to spur geographically germane adaption strategies. In the Las Vegas Valley, climate change (drought and high sustained temperatures) and population affect water, energy, and food systems. This clarity of a place based model can help educate the public about the resilience of their place, and facilitate and organize the planning process in the face of uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "The highly visible phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) is examined through the prism of carbon accumulation, wetland loss and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Mississippi River Deltaic region experiences higher relative sea level rise due to coupled subsidence and eustatic sea level rise allowing this region to serve as a proxy for future projected golbal sea level rise. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils is based on vertical marsh accretion and areal change data. While coastal marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion, large amounts of carbon, previously sequested in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes as well as through GHG emissions. Efforts are underway in Louisiana to access the carbon credit market in order to provide significant funding for coastal restoration projects. However, there is very large uncertainty on GHG emission rates related to both marsh type and temporal (daily and seasonal) effects. Very little data currently exists which addresses this uncertainty which can significantly affect the carbon credit value of a particular wetland system. We provide an analysis of GHG emission rates for coastal freshwater, brackish and and salt marshes compared to the net soil carbon sequestration rate. Results demonstrate that there is very high uncertainty on GHG emissions which can substantially alter the carbon credit value of a particular wetland system.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in regional climate prediction is distinguishing the anthropogenically-forced response from low-frequency internal variability. In a large ensemble, the forced response is well approximated by the mean trend of the ensemble members. However, in mountainous regions like the Pacific Northwest, very high model resolution is required to accurately represent the terrain, making large ensembles prohibitively expensive. Here we take a different approach, employing a statistical technique called \"dynamical adjustment\" to estimate the forced response of wintertime (DJF) surface temperature and precipitation within two high-resolution simulations of the 21st-century climate in the Pacific Northwest. The simulations were performed at 12-km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, downscaled from global CCSM3 and ECHAM5 simulations under an A1B emissions scenario. While the raw simulations exhibit large differences in the magnitude and spatial structure of precipitation and surface temperature trends, dynamical adjustment results in much better agreement between the simulations, especially with regard to projected surface warming. These results suggest that dynamical adjustment of a small number of high-resolution simulations can provide much of the benefit of a large ensemble, but at far less computational expense.",

The practice and outcomes of disaster risk management will likely undergo further change as several emerging earth science technologies come of age: mobile devices; location-based services; ubiquitous sensors; drones; small satellites; satellite direct readout; Big Data analytics; cloud computing; Web services for predictive modeling, semantic reconciliation, and collaboration; and many others. Integrating these new technologies well requires developing and adapting them to meet current needs; but also rethinking current practice to draw on new capabilities to reach additional objectives. This requires a holistic view of the disaster risk management enterprise and of the analytical or operational capabilities afforded by these technologies.\nOne helpful tool for this assessment, the GEOSS Architecture for the Use of Remote Sensing Products in Disaster Management and Risk Assessment (Evans & Moe, 2013), considers all phases of the disaster risk management lifecycle for a comprehensive set of natural hazard types, and outlines common clusters of activities and their use of information and computation resources. We are using these architectural views, together with insights from current practice, to highlight effective, interrelated roles for emerging earth science technologies in disaster risk management.

            "abstract": "Landslide generated tsunamis such as Lituya Bay, Alaska 1958 account for some of highest recorded tsunami runup heights. Source and runup scenarios based on real world events are physically modeled using generalized Froude similarity in the three dimensional NEES tsunami wave basin at Oregon State University. A novel pneumatic landslide tsunami generator (LTG) was deployed to simulate landslides with varying geometry and kinematics. The bathymetric and topographic scenarios tested with the LTG are the basin-wide propagation and runup, fjord, curved headland fjord and a conical island setting representing a landslide off an island or a volcano flank collapse. The LTG consists of a sliding box filled with 1,350 kg of landslide material which is accelerated by pneumatic pistons down slope. Two different landslide materials are used to study the granulometry effects: naturally rounded river gravel and cobble mixtures.\nWater surface elevations are recorded by an array of resistance wave gauges. The landslide deformation is measured from above and underwater camera recordings. The landslide deposit is measured on the basin floor with a multiple transducer acoustic array (MTA). Landslide surface reconstruction and kinematics are determined with a stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. Wave runup is recorded with resistance wave gauges along the slope and verified with video image processing. The measured landslide and wave parameters are compared between the planar hill slope used in various scenarios and the convex hill slope of the conical island. The energy conversion rates from the landslide motion to the wave train is quantified for the planar and convex hill slopes. The wave runup data on the opposing headland is analyzed and evaluated with wave theories. The measured landslide and tsunami data serve to validate and advance three-dimensional numerical landslide tsunami prediction models.\nTwo 3D Navier-Stokes models were tested, the commercial code FLOW-3D and the tsunami model TSUNAMI3D. The prediction of the wave fields and runups by the models were compared and analyzed to improve methodologies and key parameters for landslide rheology. Model errors with respect to the set of experiments were estimated and compared against the allowable errors indicated by the NTHMP.",

            "abstract": "During a Snowball Earth event, almost all of the ocean surface first freezes as sea ice. As in modern sea ice, trapped inclusions of liquid brine permeate the ice cover. As the ice grows and cools, salt crystals precipitate within the inclusions. At -23C, the most abundant salt in seawater, sodium chloride, begins to precipitate as the dihydrate mineral hydrohalite (NaCl·2H2O).\nCrystals of hydrohalite within the sea ice scatter light. Measurements of cold, natural sea ice show a broadband albedo increase of 10-20% when salt precipitates. Such snow-free natural sea ice with a surface temperature below -23C is rare on modern Earth, but would have been common in tropical regions of a Snowball Earth where evaporation exceeded precipitation. The persistent cold and lack of summer melt on the Snowball ocean surface, combined with net evaporation, is hypothesized to yield lag deposits of hydrohalite crystals on the ice surface.\nTo investigate this process, we prepared laboratory-grown sea ice in a 1000 liter tank in a walk-in freezer laboratory. The ice was cooled below -23 C and the surface sprayed with a 23% NaCl solution to create a layer of hydrohalite-enriched ice, a proxy for lag deposits that would have formed over long periods of surface sublimation. We have developed a novel technique for measuring the spectral albedo of ice surfaces in the laboratory; this technique was used to monitor the evolution of the surface albedo of our salt crust as the ice matrix sublimated away leaving a layer of fine-grained hydrohalite crystals. Measurements of this hydrohalite surface crust show a very high albedo, comparable to fresh snow at visible wavelengths and significantly larger than fresh snow at near infrared wavelengths. Broadband albedos are 0.55 for bare artificial sea ice at -30C, 0.75 for ice containing 25% hydrohalite by volume, 0.84 after five days of desiccation and 0.93 after 47 days of desiccation.\nUsing our laboratory measurements, along with estimates of grain size and crust optical depth, as inputs to Mie scattering and radiative transfer models allowed us to infer the imaginary refractive index of hydrohalite. The model can calculate albedo for pure hydrohalite crusts of varying thickness and for mixtures of ice and hydrohalite. A parameterization is presented for albedo as a function of the thickness of the hydrohalite crust.",

Advances in remote sensing technologies and associated tools enable the collection and quantitative analysis of observations over large geographic regions.

Over 7000 peoples was perished around Gifu prefecture, central Japan by the earthquake. \nIt was passed 20 years to be established a constitutional monarchy in Japan, and Meiji government modernized oneself after the West. The cities, towns and villages were decreasing to 15,859 from 71,314 by the community integration in 1888-1889. And yet, there were 61 towns and villages in Motosu county located in the hypocenter of the Nobi earthquake at the time, and there were 33,000 people. The 61 towns and villages were consisting with populations of 114 -3506, and households of 14-3508. \nGifu prefecture published a disaster report on the numbers of collapsed house and casualties by the earthquake, including the populations and households on all cities, towns in a week after the earthquake. Already Muramatsu (1983) and Iida (1985) discussed the Gifu prefecture disaster report, and they calculated the collapse rate and estimated the seismic intensities in the towns and villages. However, they never discuss precisely the disaster in each city, town and village. \nFirstly, we make a distribution map of the completely-collapse rates of the cities, towns and villages in Gifu and Aichi prefectures using GIS software. As Muramatsu already pointed out that there are two regions over 90% of collapse rates precisely. One is located along the Neodani fault, and it is a very narrow area. The other is located wide area in north Nobi Plain.\nSome research groups suggest another fault named Gifu-Ichinomiya line, because the region of seismic intensity 7 is estimated from Gifu to south Nagoya. However high collapse rate over 90% is not distributed as zones. It is suggested that collapsed houses are increased by shallow ground structures such as alluvium. \nSurely, alluvium is distributed with thick with 50 m maximally in the region. However, more local distribution of gravel layers and natural levee should affect the collapse distributions. \nAdditionally, there were remarkable house collapses in the high collapse rate region of at the 1944 M8.0 Tonankai earthquake, one of the mega-thrust earthquakes in Nankai trough. It is very important data at the Nobi earthquake to discuss the regional disaster in next earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Public understanding of climate change is fraught with misconceptions. In some cases, these may arise due to the complexity of the topic: the difference between personal experience of short-term weather events, for example, as compared to long-term analysis of a climate trend. In others, myths may be deliberately introduced: that climate has ceased to change, or that changes have been proven to be due to natural causes.\nWhatever their origin, these misconceptions hold powerful implications for education on climate change and related science topics. Conceptual change theory demonstrates how pre-existing misconceptions persist under regular instruction and interfere with student acquisition of correct concepts. Here, we assess the extent to which incorporating corrective instruction on misconceptions related to the greenhouse effect and on the role of human activities in climate change affects student acquisition and retention of key scientific concepts. We investigate the efficacy of this approach using two reading passages: one that simply discusses the science, and another that provides both science and misconceptions-related information. Study subjects were drawn from a first year Atmospheric Sciences course at a large public university, yielding 197 students who successfully completed the pretest, instructional treatment, immediate posttest, delayed posttest, and a background survey. While both treatments produced significant gains in the posttest and delayed posttest overall, only the treatment that directly targeted misconceptions produced long-term gains on misconception-related questions.\nOur results support the conceptual change model’s basic claim that misconceptions may persist through concept-based instruction, but may be uprooted by even a relatively brief reading passage that addresses them directly. However, our results also contain a striking anomaly: for questions involving the phrase “global warming,” misconceptions-based instruction did not produce greater long-term gain. Here, we analyze the influence of student demographics on performance overall as well as by question type, to begin to elucidate the extent to which pre-existing biases may influence the retention of misconceptions even in the face of corrective instruction.",

            "abstract": "For most of its bathymetric survey activities, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) requires high precision, three dimensional positioning. As part of a pilot project, one of its launches was equipped with a GNSS receiver processing a high precision correction service in real time (HP-GPS*C) via the internet using satellite telecommunication. This service was provided by Natural Resources Canada/Canadian Geodetic Survey (NRCan/CGS). The bathymetric data from a survey in eastern Hudson Bay performed by CHS in Fall 2013 was post –processed using different standard methods. This resulted in high precision positions that were compared with positions corrected with the real-time precise point positioning (PPP) service (HP-GPS*C) from NRCan/CGS.\n CHS bathymetric surveys must be referred to chart datum, the hydrographical vertical datum defined for use on nautical charts. In the Canadian north, another limitation to high precision bathymetric work is the availability of tide observations and/or predictions. The territory is vast and tide data is limited in space and in time while predicted tides are not always accurate. This makes reductions of bathymetric soundings to Chart datum difficult. To address this problem, CHS and NRCan/CGS have collaborated to produce a Continuous Vertical Datum for Canadian Waters (CVDCW), which incorporates data from NRCan's geoid model, tide gauge and GPS data, satellite altimetry, and ocean models. Thus high precision positioning provides ellipsoidal heights for the bathymetric depths, and the CVDCW allows to correct these ellipsoidal heights to chart datum. Comparisons of the bathymetry from the pilot survey corrected for tide data versus the bathymetry referred to its ellipsoidal height corrected to chart datum with the CVDCW are given to demonstrate the relative changes to the depths. This also illustrates the advantage of a continuous vertical datum with its potential to be combined with real-time high precision positioning.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization will arguably be the most significant demographic trend of the 21st century, particularly in fast-growing regions of the developing world. Characterizing urbanization in a spatial context, however, is a difficult task given only the moderate resolution data provided by traditional sources of demographic data (i.e., censuses and surveys). Using a sample of five world “mega-cities” we demonstrate how new satellite data products and new analysis of existing satellite data, when combined with new applications of census and survey microdata, can reveal more about cities and urbanization in combination than either data type can by itself.\nIn addition to the partially modelled Global Urban-Rural Mapping Project (GRUMP) urban extents we consider four sources of remotely sensed data that can be used to estimate urban extents; the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) intercallibrated nighttime lights time series data, the newer NOAA Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) radar satellite data, and Dense Sampling Method (DSM) analysis of the NASA scatterometer data. Demographic data come from national censuses and/or georeferenced survey data from the Demographic & Health Survey (DHS) program. We overlay demographic and remotely sensed data (e.g., Figs 1, 2) to address two questions; (1) how well do satellite derived measures of urban intensity correlate with demographic measures, and (2) how well are temporal changes in the data correlated. Using spatial regression techniques, we then estimate statistical relationships (controlling for influences such as elevation, coastal proximity, and economic development) between the remotely sensed and demographic data and test the ability of each to predict the other.\nSatellite derived imagery help us to better understand the evolution of the built environment and urban form, while the underlying demographic data provide information regarding composition of urban population change. Combining these types of data yields important, high resolution spatial information that provides a more accurate understanding of urban processes.",

            "abstract": "The southwestern United States is expected to become warmer and drier under future climate projections. The way in which plant and ecosystems respond to these changes is valuable for predicting carbon and water cycling, ecosystem resilience, phenology, and future agriculture, including biofuel production. We examined the interacting effects of dominant climate stressors--vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature--on photosynthesis. Specifically, we tested whether or not plant production of the terpene isoprene imparts heat and water-stress tolerance. Within an experimental common garden of poplars (Populus) at University of Arizona’s Biosphere 2 we measured four separate genetic lines - two that retained isoprene production capacity and two that had this gene “knocked out”. VPD was altered at temperatures of 30, 35, and 40C to present both heat and aridity stresses. Maximum photosynthetic capacity (Amax), the VPD at which Amax occurred (VPDopt), and the VPD range between Amax and ninety percent of Amax (Ω90) were calculated to quantify how VPD differentially affected the lines. Amax was significantly lower in knockout lines than in control lines. Moreover, the difference in Amax between lines increased from 19.3% at 30C to 28.4% at 35C to 39.0% at 40C, indicating that trees without isoprene production are less equipped to handle hot and dry conditions. Ω90 and VPDopt response were not the same, though. Isoprene knockouts had significantly higher VPD optimums (1.9749 kPA vs. 1.6451 kPa) compared to isoprene-producing lines. Although maximum photosynthesis is diminished without isoprene production under water and heat stress, isoprene knockout lines were still fairly active at a high VPD and under a wide range of VPD conditions. Beyond advancing our basic understanding of plant ecophysiology, these results will inform the potential use of poplars as a source of biofuel production across a range of current and projected climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "The realization that well designed graphs and clearly worded summaries were not enough to spur the public and policy makers towards an appropriate understanding of our planet encouraged me to search for other ways to share climate stories with the general public. After co-authoring a popular book on food and climate change and giving many talks to the general public, it struck me that young people were largely missing from the dialogue, and little meaningful progress was being made to design effective solutions. I then started working with faculty and students from the Film and Animation Departments at San Jose State University to develop stories about climate change that would be engaging to younger audiences. The result was the Green Ninja Project, based around the Green Ninja, a superhero who focuses on solutions to climate change using humor and silliness to soften what can be a somewhat challenging topic. The Project includes a) The Green Ninja Show – a series of YouTube videos (over 1,000,000 views) highlighting actions young people can take to reduce climate change, b) The Green Ninja Film Festival where students tell their own climate solutions stories, and c) a collection of educational resources that help teachers bring climate science topics into their classroom using hands-on activities. A key component to this work is promoting social action experiences, so that young people can understand how their actions can make a difference. Based on these experiences, I will provide my own reflections on the challenges and opportunities of communicating climate change with young people.",

            "abstract": "While a proliferation of instrumented research watersheds and new data sharing technologies has transformed hydrologic research in recent decades, similar advances have not been realized in hydrologic education. Long-standing problems in hydrologic education include discontinuity of hydrologic topics from introductory to advanced courses, inconsistency of content across academic departments, and difficulties in development of laboratory and homework assignments utilizing large time series and spatial data sets. Hydrologic problems are typically not amenable to “back-of-the-chapter” examples. Local, long-term research watersheds offer solutions to these problems. Here, we describe our integration of research and monitoring programs in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed into undergraduate and graduate hydrology programs at Boise State University. We developed a suite of watershed-based exercises into courses and curriculums using real, tangible datasets from the watershed to teach concepts not amenable to traditional textbook and lecture methods. The aggregation of exercises throughout a course or degree allows for scaffolding of concepts with progressive exposure of advanced concepts throughout a course or degree. The need for exercises of this type is growing as traditional lecture-based classes (passive learning from a local authoritative source) are being replaced with active learning courses that integrate many sources of information through situational factors.",

            "abstract": "Our goal is to investigate possible sources of predictability of hydrometeorological extreme events in the Northern High Plains. Hydrometeorological extreme events are considered the most costly natural phenomena. Water deficits and surpluses highlight how the water-climate interdependence becomes crucial in areas where single activities drive economies such as Agriculture in the NHP. Nonetheless we recognize the Water-Climate interdependence and the regulatory role that human activities play, we still grapple to identify what sources of predictability could be added to flood and drought forecasts. To identify the benefit of multi-scale climate modeling and the role of initial conditions on flood and drought predictability on the NHP, we use the Ocean Land Atmospheric Model (OLAM). OLAM is characterized by a dynamic core with a global geodesic grid with hexagonal (and variably refined) mesh cells and a finite volume discretization of the full compressible Navier Stokes equations, a cut-grid cell method for topography (that reduces error in computational gradient computation and anomalous vertical dispersion). Our hypothesis is that wet conditions will drive OLAM’s simulations of precipitation to wetter conditions affecting both flood forecast and drought forecast. To test this hypothesis we simulate precipitation during identified historical flood events followed by drought events in the NHP (i.e. 2011-2012 years). We initialized OLAM with CFS-data 1-10 days previous to a flooding event (as initial conditions) to explore (1) short-term and high-resolution and (2) long-term and coarse-resolution simulations of flood and drought events, respectively. While floods are assessed during a maximum of 15-days refined-mesh simulations, drought is evaluated during the following 15 months. Simulated precipitation will be compared with the Sub-continental Observation Dataset, a gridded 1/16th degree resolution data obtained from climatological stations in Canada, US, and Mexico. This in-progress research will ultimately contribute to integrate OLAM and VIC models and improve predictability of extreme hydrometeorological events.",

            "abstract": "The northern Californian Coast ranges present a unique area to study landscape response to transient tectonic uplift. Studies have shown that an increase in uplift may be balanced by the rate of landsliding in settings of steady uplift. However, the landsliding response to transient tectonic uplift remains to be elucidated. The Californian Coast ranges are shaped by the northward migration of the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ), which geodynamic modeling suggests produces a transient double-humped uplift field. A major research question is whether we can detect a signature of this transient tectonic uplift in landslide activity and document how the channel network communicates this signal to hillslopes.\nUsing air photos and Worldview imagery, we manually mapped more than 2000 earthflows and debris slides in the Eel and surrounding catchments that span the ~400 km-long region. The velocities of active earthflows were estimated by visually tracking features between images spanning 1993 to 2013. We mapped channel steepness from 10m NED DEMs in Topotoolbox 2 and developed a new tool to automatically define knickpoints along the channel network.\nEarthflows occur almost exclusively in a band of Franciscan mélange oriented along the MTJ transect whilst debris slides are more evenly distributed by lithology. Both earthflows and debris slides are clustered in the Eel catchment around the proposed uplift peaks and are largely absent outside of these zones. Within these areas of high landslide densities, we observe peaks in active earthflows adjacent to peaks in dormant earthflows to the south, suggesting that the signature of earthflow activity remains for a period of time once the uplift peak has passed. Landslide density, mean landslide area, and earthflow velocity all increase rapidly above threshold values of channel steepness and local relief. In the Eel catchment, where the zone of rapid uplift is commencing, landslides, particularly earth flows, are concentrated below an elevation band bracketed by knickpoints that we suggest reflects a wave of incision sweeping upstream from the outlet. We suggest that landslide activity upstream of this zone of adjusting topography may reflect a more complex response to the passage of the uplift peak that causes tilting and internal steepening of the headwaters.",

The core of the program is “local observations, global connections.” First, students develop an understanding of ocean conditions at their doorstep through the analysis of community-based observatory data. Then, they connect that knowledge with the health of the global ocean by engaging with students at other schools participating in the educational program and through supplemental educational resources.\nOcean Networks Canada (ONC), an initiative of the University of Victoria, operates cabled ocean observatories which supply continuous power and Internet connectivity to a broad suite of subsea instruments from the coast to the deep sea. This Internet connectivity permits researchers, students and members of the public to download freely available data on their computers anywhere around the globe, in near real-time.\nIn addition to the large NEPTUNE and VENUS cabled observatories off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, ONC has been installing smaller, community-based cabled observatories. Currently two are installed: one in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut and one at Brentwood College School, on Mill Bay in Saanich Inlet, BC. Several more community-based observatories are scheduled for installation within the next year. The observatories support a variety of subsea instruments, such as a video camera, hydrophone and water quality monitor and shore-based equipment including a weather station and a video camera.\nSchools in communities hosting an observatory are invited to participate in the program, alongside schools located in other coastal and inland communities. Students and teachers access educational material and data through a web portal, and use video conferencing and social media tools to communicate their findings. A series of lesson plans introduces the teachers and students to cabled observatory technology and instrumentation, including technical aspects and their value in monitoring changing ocean conditions.\nThis presentation will describe the program in more detail and report on our experiences in the first months of the pilot year.",

            "abstract": "Chronic erosion dominates sandy beaches of Hawaii causing loss and beach narrowing; and damaging homes, infrastructure, and critical habitat. Increased rates of sea level rise (SLR) will likely exacerbate these problems. Shoreline managers and other stakeholders need guidance to support long-range planning and adaptation efforts. Despite recent advances in sophisticated numerical models, there remains a need for simple approaches to estimating land areas that are threatened by erosion on decadal-to-century time scales due to SLR. While not as detailed as numerical models, empirical approaches can provide a first-order approximation to shoreline change that may be useful for coastal management and planning. Shoreline managers in Hawaii commonly work with historical data to provide information on coastal erosion. Simple linear regression methods have been especially attractive in Hawaii, where complex reef topography can cause high spatial variability in sediment transport patterns. Yet, facing projected future increases in the rate of SLR, extrapolating historical trends is insufficient. Predictions of shoreline change with SLR commonly employ controversial geometric models (e.g., the Bruun Model) that do not account for sediment availability and alongshore variability captured in historical data. Furthermore, these two projections often produce conflicting results. We report here on the early results of mapping probability-based erosion hazard areas, determined by combining the extrapolated historical shoreline change model with a geometric model of shoreline response (Davidson-Arnott, 2005) to strictly accelerated SLR. A geographic information system is used to explore the intersection between potential erosion hazards, coastal geology, and development patterns. This approach is attractive because it is simple and utilizes existing datasets. Yet, its simplicity implies broad assumptions of the coastal system and leads to large uncertainty in projections. To investigate the applicability of such an approach and identify management needs, erosion hazard areas are projected at various time intervals and confidence levels for ten Hawaii beaches.\nRef.: Davidson-Arnott, R.

            "abstract": "NO, a minor species in the thermosphere, is an important indicator of energy balance. It also has the lowest ionization threshold so is the terminal ion in the ionospheric E-region. Solar soft X-ray energy between 0.1 and 7 nm is absorbed mostly in the lower thermosphere between 100 and 150 km. Photoelectrons are created and initiate chains of photochemical reactions which leads to the production of nitric oxide (NO). On the other hand, solar irradiance longer than 150 nm destroys NO. In this study, observation of the local-time variation of NO abundance in the lower thermosphere is derived from the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS) measurements in summer 2010. Soft X-ray and EUV irradiance from the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) is used to drive the NOx1D model during the same period of time. By comparing variation of NO abundance at local sunlit hours, the effects of solar irradiance on thermospheric NO photochemistry in the model are examined.",

            "abstract": "Solid exoplanets offer a unique opportunity for comparative planetology with the small solar system planets, and in particular with Earth. With more than 40 low-mass planets (with masses less than 10 earth-masses) with measured masses and radii, it is now possible to distinguish trends in the data. Although most of these planets have a substantial envelope that makes them closer in nature to Uranus and Neptune, there are about 10 low-mass exoplanets that are potentially rocky. Despite the uncertainties in the data (especially in the mass), it is becoming evident that there is variety in compositions expressed mostly in a wide range of Fe/Si ratios that may affect the interior dynamics and thermal evolution of these planets. In addition, numerous observing campaigns have targeted M stars to find super-Earths in the habitable zone, as this region is closer to the host star. It is well recognized that these planets may also be subjected to variable amounts of early and/or sustained tidal heating. This may in turn affect the mode of convection and outgassing of these planets. I will present results on the lessons learned from the super-Earth data and the implications of variable Fe/Si ratio and tidal heating for the dynamics of the interior using the model by [1] including a simple degassing model for water.\n[1] Tackley, P.

            "abstract": "This presentation describes a suite of global precipitation products reconstructed by a multivariate regression method using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) expansion. The sampling errors of the reconstruction are estimated for each product datum entry. The maximum temporal coverage is 1850-present and the spatial coverage is quasi-global (75S, 75N). The temporal resolution ranges from 5-day, monthly, to seasonal and annual. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation data from 1979-2008 are used to calculate the EOFs. The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) gridded data are used to calculate the regression coefficients for reconstructions. The sampling errors of the reconstruction are analyzed in detail for different EOF modes. Our reconstructed 1900-2011 time series of the global average annual precipitation shows a 0.024 (mm/day)/100a trend, which is very close to the trend derived from the mean of 25 models of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5). Our reconstruction examples of 1983 El Niño precipitation and 1917 La Niña precipitation (Figure 1) demonstrate that the El Niño and La Niña precipitation patterns are well reflected in the first two EOFs.\nThe validation of our reconstruction results with GPCP makes it possible to use the reconstruction as the benchmark data for climate models. This will help the climate modeling community to improve model precipitation mechanisms and reduce the systematic difference between observed global precipitation, which hovers at around 2.7 mm/day for reconstructions and GPCP, and model precipitations, which have a range of 2.6-3.3 mm/day for CMIP5.\nOur precipitation products are publically available online, including digital data, precipitation animations, computer codes, readme files, and the user manual.

            "abstract": "The Banda Arc of Indonesia remains one of the least understood tectonic domains on the modern Earth. The island of Sumba, located approximately 50 km south of Flores and 120 km north of the Java Trench, northwest of where it transitions into the Timor Trough, lies in a region of tectonic transition and potentially offers insights into regional dynamics. The Banda Arc is volcanically active, but Sumba itself is not volcanic. The northern coast of Sumba is covered in Quaternary coral terraces, with the rest of the island's surface geology composed of Mio-pliocene carbonates and uplifted Late Cretaceous-Oligocene forearc basin and volcanic rocks. The purpose of this study is to remotely map the topographic expression of the coral terraces and use the information gained to better understand deformation on Sumba since their deposition. The ages of the coral terraces, of which many platforms are exposed over significant areas of the island, have been constrained at Cape Luandi in north central Sumba, but uplift rates calculated from those ages may not be representative of the island as a whole. The lateral continuity of these dated terraces can help constrain the extent to which uplift of Sumba is spatially variable. Analysis of the terraces using SRTM digital elevation data with ArcGIS software makes it possible to trace the same terrace platforms over large distances, and shows that the north central part of the island has experienced the most uplift since the deposition of the terraces, forming an anticline with the east limb dipping more steeply than the west. The terraces are not well preserved on the southern half of the island. Exposure of older rocks and lack of terrace preservation, as well as a south-skewed drainage divide suggests the southern half of the island experiences greater exhumation, but this could be driven by climate or other factors and does not necessarily indicate more rapid uplift. Study of Quaternary deformation of Sumba can offer greater understanding of the ongoing collision of the Banda Arc with the Australian continent. A more complete picture of the region may provide insights into seismic hazards as well as the behavior of arc-continent collision systems and active margins in general.",

            "abstract": "The Calabrian Arc is a subduction-rollback system that has experienced remarkably peaceful forearc tectonics during the last 12 My of rollback, even with 780 km of backarc extension. In contrast, during the Middle Pleistocene rollback slowed and the forearc experienced a surge of tectonic activity including 15-20° of clockwise rotation, arc-parallel extension, and widespread uplift. This rapid and continuous uplift (1-1.2 mm/yr) has affected the entire forearc and is striking because subduction is presumed to be ongoing. No discernable structure or mechanism has been identified to account for all phenomena. We combine structural mapping and erosion rates from 10Be concentrations in river sediment to model river erosion into the Sila Massif, the most prominent highland in northern Calabria. Interfluves between river gorges on the east side of the Sila Massif preserve a tilted paleosurface, which we interpret as subhorizontal until post-Early Pliocene. We reconstruct uplift and river incision using a forward model that is calibrated using the current erosion rates and the elevation of the paleosurface above the Neto River bed. The model tests two end-member structural growth models of uplift: tilting a fixed hinge and tilting from a propagating hinge. The propagating hinge model generates a better fit with the modern river profile and the modern erosion rates. We independently constrain uplift to beginning between 800 ka and 900 ka, consistent with the Late Pleistocene tectonic upheaval. In addition, the results show the Sila Massif grew via tilting with a propagating hinge. This method can be applied to other tectonic regions as a new way to quantify and identify young and active structures.",

            "abstract": "We conducted a rigorous analysis of the drivers of seasonality in the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Many studies report annual cycles in UHI intensity and have attributed those patterns to various hypotheses, including seasonal trends in wind and clouds, prevalence of anti-cyclonic conditions, soil moisture, and day length. But to our knowledge, those hypotheses have never been tested, leaving a substantial gap in our basic understanding of the urban climate.\nWe tested these and other hypotheses using two years of continuous temperature measurements from an array of 150 sensors in and around Madison, Wisconsin USA, an urban area of 407,000 surrounded by lakes and a rural landscape of agriculture, forests, wetlands, and grasslands. This is one of the best replicated urban climate arrays ever deployed, which allowed us to characterize the UHI in rich spatial and temporal detail and rigorously assess the biophysical and synoptic drivers of its seasonal variation.\nUHI intensities were typically highest in summer and lowest in winter. Seasonal trends in wind speed and cloud cover generally tracked annual trends in UHI intensity, with the clearer, calmer conditions conducive to stronger UHIs more common in summer. This is consistent with the hypothesis that seasonal trends in wind, clouds, and anti-cyclonic conditions drive UHI seasonality. However, clear, calm summer nights still had higher UHI intensities than clear, calm winter nights, indicating that some background factor shifted baseline UHI intensities throughout the year. We found that regional vegetation and snow cover conditions set distinct seasonal baselines for UHI intensity, with nighttime intensities averaging 4°C in summer and 1°C in winter. Synoptic and biophysical factors that vary on shorter time scales (e.g. wind, clouds, soil moisture, relative humidity) modified daily UHI intensity around those baselines by 1-3°C but were not the primary drivers of UHI seasonality, contrary to the most common hypotheses in the literature.\nIn addition to clarifying the drivers of UHI seasonality, our results have implications for the design and interpretation of UHI studies, particularly in how the timing of data collection might affect results and conclusions.",

            "abstract": "The transition region of the solar atmosphere is no longer believed to be exclusively a thin boundary layer connecting the chromosphere and the corona. Instead, the emission from this region is dominated by dynamic, low-lying loops with peak temperatures <1 MK. These loops also appear in AIA data due to the transition region spectral lines in the AIA passbands, but have not been studied with great detail. The IRIS instrument has resolved these loops both spatially and temporally. With an IRIS image cadence of approximately 10 seconds, we are able to study the evolution of these loops.\nWe have developed a technique to automatically identify events (i.e., brightenings) on a pixel-by-pixel basis applying a set of selection criteria. The pixels are then grouped according to their proximity in space and relative progression of the event. This method allows us to characterize their overall lifetime and the rate at which these events occur. Our current progress includes identification of these groups of events in IRIS data, determination of their existence in AIA data, and characterization based on a comparison between the two. If the same events appear in both IRIS and AIA data, it may suggest that the intrinsic transition region is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We present the results that follow each integral step in the analysis and provide a preliminary characterization of a few example events within our data set.",

Produced water from oil wells tapping a carbonate-hosted reservoir at an active EOR site in the Permian Basin of Texas both before and after injection were sampled to evaluate geochemical and isotopic changes associated with water-rock-CO2 interaction. Produced waters from the carbonate reservoir rock are Na-Cl brines with TDS levels of 16.5-34 g/L and detectable H2S. These brines are potentially diluted with shallow groundwater from earlier EOR water flooding. Initial lithium isotope data (δ7Li) from pre-injection produced water in the EOR field fall within the range of Gulf of Mexico Coastal sedimentary basin and Appalachian basin values (Macpherson et al., 2014, Geofluids, doi: 10.1111/gfl.12084). Pre-injection produced water 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70788-0.70795) are consistent with mid-late Permian seawater/carbonate. CO2 injection took place in October 2013, and four of the wells sampled in May 2014 showed CO2 breakthrough. Preliminary comparison of pre- and post-injection produced waters indicates no significant changes in the major inorganic constituents following breakthrough, other than a possible drop in K concentration. Trace element and isotope data from pre- and post-breakthrough wells are currently being evaluated and will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Recent ecological research has strongly linked plant function to leaf-level biochemical and plant structural traits over a wide range of species and environmental conditions. Broad classifications of plant functional types (PFTs) have conventionally been used in mapping and modeling efforts, as they capture major patterns in the variation of these traits. While strong relationships between canopy imaging spectrometer data and leaf biochemical composition have been established in tropical ecosystems, these relationships have not been well-documented over a broader range of ecosystems. In this study, we sought to characterize relationships between leaf-level functional traits and leaf and canopy-scale reflectance. We examined how variation within each data set corresponds to conventional PFTs and how additional sources of variation at canopy level can impact these relationships. We collected leaf trait data (pigments, water, dry matter, thickness, carbon & nitrogen) and leaf reflectance from a diverse set of species and PFTs across multiple sites and seasons in California as part of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission study. Image data were acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Using ordination analysis, we assessed major axes of variation in leaf traits, leaf spectra and canopy spectra by species and functional types. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis was used to evaluate existing groups within each dataset and to determine how well these match conventional PFTs. We also investigated the role of pixel composition and structure on spectral clustering within the AVIRIS data. Our results show that both leaf spectral clusters and biochemical trait clusters correspond to differences among species and sites, as well as conventional PFTs. Greater variation is present in the leaf spectra than in the biochemical data, indicating the spectra may be sensitive to additional leaf traits. Canopy-level spectral clusters were different from leaf-level clusters, though species and site differences were still observed. We demonstrate these differences can be attributed to pixel composition and canopy structure that must be accounted for if sensors such as HyspIRI will be used to accurately retrieve canopy biochemistry and leaf functional traits.",

            "abstract": "Ice giants remain largely unexplored, as their large distance from the Sun limits both Earth-based observations and spacecraft visits. The significant occurrence of ice giant-sized planets among detected exoplanets presents an impetus to study Uranus to understand planetary formation, dynamics, and evolution. In addition, Uranus is also uniquely interesting, given the large inclination of its rotation axis and magnetospheric configuration. In this work, we design a mission concept that aims to maximize scientific return by measuring Uranus’ chemical composition, internal structure, and magnetosphere, the first two being primary indicators of ice giant formation mechanisms.\nFor this study, we analyze the trade space for a Uranus mission constrained by a cost cap of $1B. We discuss the decision making processes behind our choices of the science priorities, instrument suite and orbital configuration. Trade space decisions include a strong onboard instrument suite in lieu of a descent probe, an orbiter instead of a flyby mission, and design constraints on the power and propulsion systems. The mission, CAELUS (Core and Atmospheric Evolution Laboratory for Uranus Science), is designed for an August 2023 launch. Following a 14-year cruise with multiple planetary gravity assists, the spacecraft would begin its science mission, which consists of a series of ten 30-day near-polar orbits around Uranus.\nThe instrument suite would consist of a microwave radiometer, Doppler seismometer, magnetometer, and UV spectrometer. These four instruments, along with a high-gain antenna capable of gravity science, would provide a comprehensive science return that meets the bulk of the scientific objectives of the 2013 NRC Planetary Science Decadal Survey for ice giants, most notably those regarding the chemical composition, interior structure, and dynamo of Uranus. This mission concept was created as part of an educational exercise for the 2014 Planetary Science Summer School at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

            "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key players in the biogeochemistry of the ocean, where they serve a critical role in the cycling of carbon and metals. Research in the past decade has introduced phytoplankton and, most recently, heterotrophic bacteria as significant sources of ROS, including superoxide, within both photic and aphotic regions of the ocean. ROS are both beneficial and detrimental to life. For instance, superoxide is a vital inter- and intra-cellular signaling molecule, yet at high concentrations it induces lipid peroxidation and initiates programmed cell death (PCD). In fact, superoxide has been implicated in PCD in the nitrogen-fixing diazotroph Trichodesmium, presumably leading to the demise of blooms within oligotrophic marine systems. Here, we explore the rates of superoxide production and decay by natural Trichodesmium populations obtained from various surface waters in the Sargasso Sea. We investigate also the role of light and colony density and morphology (puff v. raft) on superoxide fluxes. We find that Trichodesmium colonies produce extracellular superoxide at extremely high rates in the dark that are on par with those of the toxic raphidophyte Chattonella. The rates of superoxide production, however, rapidly decline with increasing cell density pointing to a role for superoxide in cell signaling in these organisms. We also find extremely rapid extracellular superoxide degradation by Trichodesmium. Together, this likely reflects a need for these organisms to maintain ROS at levels that will support signaling but below the threshold level that triggers PCD or oxidative damage. We also show differences in the effect of light on superoxide fluxes as a function of Trichodesmium colony morphology, suggesting differences in either colony physiology or associated bacterial symbionts. These findings point to complex physiological, ecological, and physical influences on ROS dynamics in phytoplankton that require further exploration.",

            "abstract": "A global top-down study of Black Carbon (BC) Emissions has found that sources are considerably higher than present day emissions datasets, with most of this underestimation stemming from the rapidly developing areas of East and Southeast Asia. An additional source in these regions is the frequent and sometimes annual influence of extreme biomass burning events, which emit additional BC and other aerosols into the atmosphere. An additional top-down study has shown that the emissions of BC from these biomass burning events in Southeast Asia contribute an additional 30% increase in the annual average BC emissions, and an additional 110% increase during the highest fire year. One important reason for this underestimation is that many of these source regions do not appear as fires, due to missing MODIS overpasses, intense cloud cover, and low fire temperatures at the wet surface.\nThese new temporally and spatially varying emissions of BC are run in a state-of-the art combined model of aerosol physics, chemistry, and general circulation, including urban scale chemical processing and core/shell aerosol mixture impacts on radiation. The results reveal that this new dataset matches in space, time, and magnitude, an array of observations (remotely sensed, ground, and column) far better than other emission datasets: IPCC SRES, AEROCOM, BOND, and GFED.\nThe modeled mean atmospheric extinction and loading are both much higher and more variable than previous modelling efforts, leading to a larger negative surface radiative forcing. At the same time, atmospheric absorption is enhanced and more variable, leading to intense atmospheric heating, with the average impact from 1.0-1.5 W/m2. This has impacts on the vertical stability in the source areas, and leads to changes in the dynamics such as a shifting of the ITCZ, reducing light precipitation and increasing strong convection. To support this, a bit of measurement-based evidence presented for each of these phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Latest studies suggest that the Miocene was a period of profound changes in Neotropical environments, with the rise of the Andes, the restriction of the Central American Seaway (CAS) and major modifications over the continent, with changing Amazon river-routing and long-standing inland seaways. Understanding how these perturbations have altered climate and in turn neotropical biodiversity require several steps, including the understanding of all physical mechanisms involved. Here we use the fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) IPSL-CM4 to quantify the impact of the uplift of the Andes and the closure of the CAS on global and regional climate, including Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and South American temperature and rainfall patterns. A simulation with lower Andes helps understanding how the mechanical effect of this barrier affects surface winds and in turn, freshwater balances over the ocean and associated sea surface temperatures. In a second experiment, we include the continental effect of the Andean uplift, i.e. the changes in river routing within the Amazon basin and modified location of its freshwater outflow to the ocean, and show that mechanical and hydrological effects of the uplift are not acting in the same direction. Lastly, as the spatial resolution of GCMs can hardly be reconciled with the geographical scale required for paleobiogeographical studies, we suggest new methods to downscale climatic layers and bridge the gaps between large-scale models and intracontinental biotic studies.",

Epiphytic lichens and mosses respond sensitively to both direct and indirect effects of global change, as evidenced by distinct changes in epiphyte community structure. Yet, few studies have explored how shifting epiphytic communities, resulting from changing climate and increasing air pollutant exposure, may greatly impact biogeochemical cycles of the forests they inhabit. We present the first study investigating how urbanization, as a proxy for global change, impacts epiphytic community structure and functional biodiversity and address the impending effects on Pacific Northwest forest biogeochemical cycles. We discuss the results of paired ground and arboreal epiphyte surveys across an urban to rural gradient in Portland, Oregon. Three research sites with varying distance (0km, 74km, and 109km) from urban center were surveyed and epiphytic biodiversity was described. Pronounced shifts in epiphyte community structure were observed downwind of the Portland metro region. These results suggest that the impacts of urbanization may have significant and surprisingly far-reaching impacts on forested ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. The impacts of an altered ground and arboreal epiphytic community on Pacific Northwest forest biogeochemical processes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Coupling between the Himalayan-Tibetan uplift and intense Asian monsoon yields tremendous regional runoff and sediment supply. This vigorous mass-transfer system sustains 7 of the world’s 10 largest riverine sediment loads, which in turn have constructed vast, fertile fluvial-deltaic lowlands. These environments across south and east Asia host about 1/3 of all people on Earth. Such large and dense populations have flourished amidst the region’s generally abundant water supplies, fisheries, and agricultural production. Yet the same environmental attributes that are so rich in resources also define a uniquely dynamic region, where rates of change are rapid and punctuated by frequent, intense events. Indeed, 8 of the world’s 10 deadliest natural disasters have occurred in this region, involving a combination of earthquakes, tropical cyclones, river floods, and tsunamis. Other stresses that regularly impact the region include periods of monsoon collapse and drought, widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater, relative sea-level rise and coastal inundation, and groundwater salinization.\nThus the communities of this region persistently face the challenge of balancing the carrying capacity of a resource-rich environment with its associated hazards and challenges. One important concept that has become increasingly more apparent is the connection within watersheds that transmits local effects both upstream and downstream within the system. Here we emphasize two additional points that we believe are essential in developing plausible strategies for sustaining health, resilience, and stability of the region. First, problems related to the natural environment are closely coupled with human activities and our concurrent responses to environmental change. Thus resulting issues are complex and multifaceted in ways that require natural scientists to better engage with researchers in the humanities and social sciences. Second, despite similar risks affecting many millions of square kilometers, the impacts of, and solutions to, such risk necessarily play out at much smaller scales closer to tens to a few hundred kilometers. This scaling includes both the natural and human landscape, underscoring the need to account for local variation in our scientific investigations.",

CE 1000 and warmer conditions in the 16th and 17th centuries. The search for climatic forcers in northern Alaska relies on integration of data drawn from tree-rings, lacustrine varves and moraines, diatoms, beach ridges and dunes. At Cape Espenberg, northern Seward Peninsula, a 1500-year reconstruction of settlement, landscape evolution and climatic variability employs >100 14C ages from accreting dunes with shell-laden storm beds, intercalated driftwood and superimposed soils, archaeological sites and marsh peats within swale ponds. Large storms occurred along the Chukchi Sea from Cape Espenberg and Deering (Kotzebue Sound) to Point Barrow prior to 1000 CE, and at decadal intervals during the Little Ice Age (LIA) from 1300 to 1700. Architecural driftwood logs from several excavated houses capped by sand dunes yield several 14C dated floating chronologies covering intervals from 700 to 1700, suggest the identification of cooler intervals 800 to 1000 and intermittently after 1300. Peat aggradation followed isolation from the sea from 500 onward, and was interrupted by two pulses of fresh water, one ca. 1300 and a second ca. 1800, with diatoms suggesting relative aridity during the LIA. The occupation history of Cape Espenberg generally follows dune growth, and may be inversely related to cooler temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The IPCC produces scientific reports out of findings on climate and climate change. Because the findings are uncertain in many respects, the production of reports requires aggregating assessments of uncertainties of different kinds. This difficult task is currently regulated by the Guidance note for lead authors of the IPCC fifth assessment report on consistent treatment of uncertainties. The note recommends that two metrics—i.e. confidence and likelihood— be used for communicating the degree of certainty in findings. Confidence is expressed qualitatively “based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence […] and the degree of agreement”, while likelihood is expressed probabilistically “based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or expert judgment”. Therefore, depending on the evidence evaluated, authors have the choice to present either an assigned level of confidence or a quantified measure of likelihood. But aggregating assessments of uncertainties of these two different kinds express distinct and conflicting methodologies. So the question arises whether the treatment of uncertainties in the IPCC is rationally justified. In order to answer the question, it is worth comparing the IPCC procedures with the formal normative theories of epistemic rationality which have been developed by philosophers. These theories—which include contributions to the philosophy of probability and to bayesian probabilistic confirmation theory—are relevant for our purpose because they are commonly used to assess the rationality of common collective jugement formation based on uncertain knowledge. In this paper we make the comparison and pursue the following objectives: i/we determine whether the IPCC confidence and likelihood can be compared with the notions of uncertainty targeted by or underlying the formal normative theories of epistemic rationality; ii/we investigate whether the formal normative theories of epistemic rationality justify treating uncertainty along those two dimensions, and indicate how this can be avoided.",

There are more questions needs to be addressed related to the role of different cloud population, conditions favorable for shallow to deep convection transitions, and their characteristics at different stages of the convective cloud life. The present study aims to improve the understanding of the shallow clouds by documenting the role of different shallow cloud population for the Year of Tropical Convection period using Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observations at the Tropical Western Pacific Manus site.

            "abstract": "The West Tahoe Fault has a mapped length of 45 km, and its vertical slip rate is estimated at 0.6-1.0 mm/yr (Dingler et al., 2009). It is the range bounding, east dipping normal fault along the west margin of the basin, and the highest slip rate section is located along the western base of Lake Tahoe at a water depth of 400-500 m. In the lake, the fault has clearly defined scarps that displace submarine fans, lake-bottom sediments, and the ~50 ka age (Kent et al., 2005; Smith et al, 2013) McKinney Bay slide. Onshore the fault displaces tree-covered glacial and fluvial landforms.\nIn October 2013 we conducted the first trenching study of the geomorphically well-defined West Tahoe Fault. Using Lidar, we selected a site with fine-grained surface sediments, as opposed to the boulder-rich moraine sediments that cover most of the onshore fault. The site is located ~3.5 km from the southern end of the mapped fault, adjacent to Osgood Swamp. In the excavation, we observed an east-dipping, normal fault juxtaposing glacial deposits against datable peat-bearing and charcoal-rich younger alluvial sediments. The glacial deposits and peat layers can be matched across the fault. Clear evidence for two earthquakes was based on scarp-derived colluvium, fissures, faulted scarp-related alluvium, liquefaction, and upward terminations of faults. Retrodeformation of the sediments results in nearly equal vertical displacements of about 1.7 m/event. Results from multiple C-14 analysis place the most recent event at ~5.3 ka and the penultimate event at ~7.4 ka.\nThe fault scarp at the trench is 3.5 m high; at the bottom of the lake at a depth of 400 m a postulated same-age fan as the trench site post-glacial deposits, has a vertical scarp of 10-12 m. As expected the slip rate decreases towards the southern end of the fault. However, if the same number of events resulted in the underwater scarp then events must average about 5-6 m vertical displacement per event. This has serious implications for earthquake generated lake tsunamis and permanent shoreline subsidence.\nThese types of onshore results are needed to validate more established paleoseismic results from Lake Tahoe based on offshore methodologies: CHIRP seismic profiling, lake cores showing earthquake triggered turbidites and ROV dives.",

            "abstract": "Creation of actionable information requires that the producers of that information understand the needs of the intended users and decision makers. To that end, development of the Third National Climate Assessment included a focus on engaging users through an inclusive, broad-based, and sustained process. Such a process provides opportunities for scientific experts and decision makers to share knowledge about the climate-related issues, impacts, and potential response actions that are most important in a particular region or sector. Such a process is also highly transparent in order to produce results that are credible, salient, and legitimate for both scientists and decision makers, ultimately making the results extremely useful.\nTo implement these principles for the recent NCA, a broad-based engagement strategy was implemented from the start of the process. The strategy invited participation from users and stakeholder communities at each stage of the process, and considered methods for communicating with potential users at every step. The strategy was designed to elicit contributions to help shape the framing of the assessment, improve the transparency of the process, and increase the utility of the final information. Specific user inputs were gathered through a series of workshops, public comment opportunities, town hall meetings, presentations, requests for information, submitted documents, and open meetings. Further, a network of contributors self-organized around topics of interest to extend the NCA to a wider range of user groups. Here, we describe the outcomes of these innovations in assessment engagement and identify clear successes, notable surprises, future evaluation needs, and areas for new ideas.",

            "abstract": "Geologic carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a feasible solution to the international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions problem and it has recently been called a \"vital\" mitigation tool by the International Energy Agency. However, there exists uncertainty concerning the terminal fate of stored carbon dioxide (CO2.) In this regard, reliable monitoring, verification and accounting (MVA) technologies are essential for making CCS publicly acceptable. Chiefly, MVA addresses safety and environmental concerns by providing a warning system to prevent or alleviate CO2 leakages. A secondary purpose of MVA technologies is to prove compliance with CO2 reduction standards through inventory verification. A key MVA tool for tracking CO2 leakages is surface (atmospheric) monitoring. Demonstrating its value, industry actors feel an impetus to invest in surface monitoring as a low-risk, high-value technology to mitigate liability in cases of potential leakages. Despite how necessary this tool is, to date, all surface monitoring mesh designs and best practices have been proposed locally, without discussion of standardization or optimization on a regional, national or international level. We identify the fundamental problem of surface monitoring mesh design as locating the monitoring sites to record CO2 levels over the designated geographic area at lowest cost with maximum impact. We approach this problem from both an operations research (OR) perspective and atmospheric dispersion perspective. From an OR perspective, we approach mesh design using multiobjective optimization models – we specify the relative placement of candidate sites, observation time interval, and optimality criteria. In the second approach, we model CO2 leakage scenarios to test the effectiveness of proposed mesh design from the first approach. We use atmospheric dispersion modeling softwares AERMOD and SCREEN3 – both tools developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and codified into law – for modeling point-source gaseous leakages at the earth's surface. In conclusion we show standardized, optimized mesh designs for known atmospheric conditions, we present a robust decision support tool for decision-makers, and we discuss implementation from both an economic and legal perspective.",

            "abstract": "Communities and government agencies are increasingly seeking to incorporate climate change information into decision-making to identify effective response actions. The Time of Emergence tool presents a new approach to supporting climate change risk assessment and decision-making by identifying the “time of emergence” (ToE) of the climate change signal for a suite of management-relevant variables. Because natural and human systems tend to be somewhat adapted to historical climate fluctuations, it is when climate change causes local conditions to deviate significantly from the past that ecological and societal disruptions may occur. A key input to deciding and prioritizing actions on climate change, therefore, is information about when and where the distinctive trend due to climate change is projected to emerge from the noise of natural climate variability. Although this information can be gleaned from existing climate change scenarios, it has not been explicitly characterized for variables and spatial scales relevant to local decision-making. Various local climate change projections, based on different emission scenarios, global climate models and downscaling methods, increases the difficulty of identifying when and where the effects of climate change could matter.\nUsing global and statistically-downscaled climate model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and hydrological model results, management-relevant climatic and environmental variables were analyzed for the US Pacific Northwest (PNW). These variables were selected in consultation with federal, state, and local decision-makers and relate to extreme temperature, precipitation and streamflow events. The web-based interactive system enables user visualization and analysis of ToE for multiple variables across the PNW at varying levels of tolerance for change. The tool also enables users to explore the effects of different sources of uncertainty in the results, e.g., due to greenhouse gas emissions, global climate models, downscaling, statistical estimation of emergence. Identified areas of concern can be combined with information about local sensitivities, design standards or critical thresholds to help identify the relative need and priority for climate change adaptation activities.",

            "abstract": "The Taney Seamounts are a NW-SE trending linear, near mid-ocean ridge chain consisting of five volcanoes located on the Pacific plate 300 km west of San Francisco, California. Taney Seamount-A, the largest and oldest in the chain, is defined by four well-exposed calderas which reveal previously infilled lavas. The calderas can be differentiated in time by their cross-cutting relationships, creating a relative chronology. The caldera walls and intracaldera pillow mounds were sampled systematically by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to obtain stratigraphically-controlled samples, a unique aspect of this study.\nLava geochemistry varies from more differentiated to more primitive with time (6.2 - 8.6 wt.% MgO), suggesting that the sub-caldera reservoir is open and undergoes periodic collapse, replenishment, shallow crystallization, and eruption. The primitive replenishing magmas entrain a crystal cargo of high-anorthite plagioclase (An80-90) with melt inclusion volatile saturation pressures (CO2 - H2O) indicating entrapment at the lower crust or upper mantle (8-12 km b.s.f). Melt inclusions exhibit positive Sr and Eu anomalies (e.g., SrPM / [CePMNdPM]1/2 ), negative Zr and Nb anomalies, and [Ba/Nb]PM >1 when normalized to primitive mantle. In comparison, the host lavas exhibit positive Sr anomalies but no concurrent Eu, Zr, and Nb anomalies and [Ba/Nb]PM <1. We propose that episodic partial melting and recrystallization of lower-crustal cumulates at the Moho result in melt inclusions with a plagioclase cumulate signal. Later percolating melts undergo diffusion with and entrain recrystallized plagioclase cumulates resulting in the positive Sr signal (but no Eu, Zr, Nb anomalies, and [Ba/Nb]PM <1). Geochemistry of the host lava and melt inclusions and crystal textures imply that melt-rock interaction is an important process in oceanic magmatic systems.",

Groundwater is one of the important resources since rainfall and surface water availability are limited. This survey was made for the purpose to determination to principle of originating groundwater potentials. For the purpose, groundwater age was investigated with the stable isotope, radiocarbon and tritium method. They were analyzed in the laboratory of CIO of Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (The Centre of Isotope Research), Institute of Groundwater Ecology from the Helmholtz Zentrum and the German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH) in Munich, Germany.\nDeep groundwater has radiocarbon ages from 13,000 to 45,000 years before present (0.4-18.4% modern C) and δ13C values from -10.0 to -4.6‰, for which it is difficult to assign absolute ages, although these values probably represent the Late Glacial period and late Pleistocene age. Shallow groundwater had tritium values of <1 to 20.8 TU, from which only 2 locations can be referred as recently infiltrated (since 1953) – or recent mixed with fossil groundwater. Groundwater aquifers were mainly found in Cretaceous sediments that have filled-up large basins in the Gobi and there is a good possibility that aquifers are interconnected via these basin sediments, although sedimentary facies changes and geological faults may form barriers to groundwater flow.",

The surface water which comes from humid regions of the High Atlas and intercepted by a dam then converged through the watercourse of Ziz towards the plain of the TOS, have created the conditions for the formation of a water table relatively rich with regard to the local climatic conditions (arid climate with recurrent drought). Given the role of the water table in the economic development of the region, a hydrogeological study was conducted to understand the impact of artificial recharge and recurrent droughts on the development of the groundwater reserves of TOS. In this study, a three-dimensional model of groundwater flow was developed for the TOS, to assist the decision makers as a \"management tool\" in order to assess alternative schemes for development and exploitation of groundwater resources based on the variation of artificial recharge and drought.\nThe results from this numerical investigation of the TOS aquifer shows that the commissioning of the dam to control the flows of extreme flood and good management of water releases, has avoided the losses of irrigation water and consequently the non-overexploitation of the groundwater. So that with one or two water releases per year from the dam of flow rate more than 28 million m3/year it is possible to reconstruct the volume of water abstracted by wells. The idea of lowering water table by pumping wells is not exactly true, as well the development of groundwater abstraction has not prevented the wound of water table in these last years, the pumping wells accompanied more than it triggers the lowering of water table and it is mainly the succession of dry periods causing the decreases of the piezometric level. This situation confirms the important role that groundwater plays as a “buffer” during the drought periods.",

In-situ biological data management in the marine domain is an exemplar. From the origination of biological occurrence records in surveys, observer programs, monitoring and experimentation, through distribution techniques, to applications, decisions, and management response, marine biological data can be difficult, limited, and costly to integrate because of non-standard and undocumented conditions in the data.\nWhile this presentation identifies deficits in marine biological data practices, the presentation also identifies this as a field of opportunity.

The continued existence of barrier island landforms will depend on the degree to which islands can maintain elevation above sea level while also responding to changes in forcing by migrating landward. We are increasingly learning that ecomorphodynamic interactions (i.e., interactions between ecological and morphodynamic processes) as well as couplings between island and back-barrier marsh environments play a critical role in determining how barrier island systems will evolve as sea level rises, storm intensity increases and the species composition of coastal vegetation changes in the future. Here, we present an overview and synthesis of recent and new model experiments and observations that illustrate the importance of feedbacks between vegetative and sediment transport processes as well as the importance of ecomorphodynamic couplings between landscape units in influencing 1) the rate of formation, maximum height and morphology of coastal dunes; 2) overall island state (high vs. low) and the potential for rapid transitions in state to occur in response to gradually changing forcing; and 3) the persistence of back-barrier marshes, and thus the influence of back-barrier marshes on the rate of migration of barrier island-marsh systems.",

Archie’s Law, calibrated to resistivity measurements on soil samples from each site, is used to estimate in-situ soil pore saturation. Three different stream types are surveyed. Increasing in stream order, these are incised bedrock with alluvium fill, incised alluvium, and braided streams. Three radar facies are identified on the basis of reflection amplitude, continuity, and dip. Near the surface, RF1 (0.5-1.5 m thick) contains laterally continuous sheetlike deposits interpreted to be active channel gravel, sand, and cobble deposits reworked during floods. Below, RF2 contains moderately continuous downlapping and onlapping reflections interpreted to be partially lithified Pleistocene gravel and cobble valley fill deposits. The underlying facies RF3 is nearly reflection free, but at the larger washes contains weak reflection similar in character to RF2. In the smaller washes, RF3 contains abundant diffractions. Two electrofacies are identified. The shallowest, EF1, extends from the surface to ~2.5 m deep. EF1 encompasses radar facies RF1 and RF2, with resistivity ranging from 250-1500 ohm-m. Estimated soil moisture in this facies ranges from 2-40%, and varies up to 20% laterally over 2-5 m distances in the smallest washes. Facies EF2 coincides with radar facies RF3, with resistivity ranging from 10-300 ohm-m and estimated pore saturation is estimated to exceed 70%. Electrofacies EF1 is inferred to represent a relatively dry surficial layer that includes the modern channel deposits and the upper ~1 m of the Pleistocene strata. At the larger washes, EF2 is interpreted to be Pleistocene valley fill, distinguishable from the overlying lithologically equivalent Pleistocene deposits by lower resistivity resulting from higher moisture content. Near surface lateral soil moisture variations in the smaller washes is strongly influenced by the subsurface stratigraphic architecture (facies RF2). In the larger washes, soil moisture variations are more subtle, changing gradationally with depth and downstream.",

Model estimates of firn properties can help in planning field campaigns and collecting ice cores. No universally accepted firn-evolution model exists, and modeled firn density profiles can be sensitive to the form of the density equation that is used. We can characterize the subtle differences between firn-evolution models by creating comparisons among a suite of published models. We created a table of temperatures and accumulation-rate values spanning the range of climatic conditions in the dry-snow zone in Greenland and Antarctica. Then, we ran each of seven firn-compaction models for each pair of climate values in the table, producing values of close-off depth, depth-integrated porosity, and delta age for each model. Using gridded temperature and accumulation-rate data from Greenland and Antarctica, we interpolated each gridded pair in our model-output tables to create maps of DIP, COD, and Δage for Greenland and Antarctica for each model. We also computed the mean and variance among the models for each property. By identifying the areas of greatest variance in our parameter space, we can better quantify our confidence in the physical descriptions of firn densification in the models.",

            "abstract": "We tested the ecological significance of a geomorphic classification of Sonoran Desert ephemeral stream channels based on channel plan-form, degree of lateral confinement, and boundary material composition. This typology has been shown to discriminate among channel geometry and hydraulic characteristics for bedrock, bedrock with alluvium, incised alluvium, braided, and piedmont headwater channels. We examined stream reach-scale relationships of geomorphic stream types to the relative cover and density of perennial plant species and functional groups, and identified the dominant fluvial drivers, within riparian communities at 101 ephemeral stream reaches on the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground and Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range in southwestern Arizona, USA. Nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance showed that species and functional group composition differed significantly among geomorphic stream types, both in terms of relative cover and density. Partitioning of among-site multivariate dissimilarity revealed that species compositional differences between stream types were caused largely by variation in the cover and density of the most common members of the regional flora. Distinctive functional group composition among reach types resulted from differences in the cover and density of drought-deciduous shrubs and subshrubs, evergreen trees and shrubs, and photosynthetic-stemmed trees. Comparison of environmental and biotic dissimilarity matrices highlighted the role of channel gradient as the dominant abiotic driver of riparian plant community composition, with stream channel elevation and width:depth providing additional explanatory power. Distinctive riparian plant community composition among the geomorphic stream types demonstrates the ecological significance of this a priori channel classification, and indicates its potential utility in understanding spatial patterns of ecological dynamics, sample stratification for process-based studies, and reference site selection.",

            "abstract": "In July 2014, we obtained a total of 94 km of high-resolution Chirp profiles from the 129 km2, brackish Lake Azuey and 37 km of profiles from the 14 km2, fresh water Lake Mirogoane that both straddle the active trace of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ) of Haiti. 80% of the grid on Azuey and 85% on Mirogoane was dedicated to north-south profiles of the EPGFZ. In Azuey we defined the linear and east-west-striking fault trace in deformed Holocene sediments along with its landfalls west of Lake Azuey in Haiti and east of Lake Azuey in the Dominican Republic. All profiles showed the fault to be a sub-vertical flower structure whose active traces could be traced on Chirp data to a depth of 30 m below the lake floor. Previous workers have suggested that this fault ruptured during a large November, 1751, earthquake with a parallel and elongate felt zone. We hypothesize the most recent break of the fault several meters below the lake floor to have formed during the 1751 event but plan a coring program to precisely constrain the timing of historical and prehistorical events based on syn-faulting colluvial wedges observed on Chirp profiles. Our survey of Mirogoane confirmed its rhomboidal pull-apart structure with the basin center at a depth of 42-8 m making this basin the deepest lake in the Caribbean region. Deformational features include active folds at the lake bottom, large oblique-slip normal faults at an angle to the bounding east-west faults, and 30 m of recognizable stratigraphy. The 7 m of Holocene cored in the basin center in 1988 is observed to be highly deformed and locally folded and overlies with angular unconformity a well stratified and more folded lower basinal unit. Historical events are proposed to have ruptured on or near this segment of the EPGFZ in 1701 and 1770.",

            "abstract": "The changes of ice sheet in Greenland have been traced through various remote sensing observations. However, it was realised that the uncertainties in the observed change of ice sheet were not fully addressed. Therefore, we devised and tested a scheme employing multiple sensor satellite data and the data fusion to spatially and temporally monitor the migration of glacier with high accuracy. The test area was established in Russell glacier in western Greenland where the change of glacier has been obvious for the last century.\nFirstly, differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) campaigns using ALOS PALSAR pairs were applied to monitor the glacial change. In terms of data fusion aspect, we then employed pixel tracing method by co-registration of ALOS PRISM optical images over target area to compensate for any line-of-sight glacial movement resulted by the D-InSAR analysis. To securely trace individual pixel, high accuracy sub-pixel co-registration algorithm was developed. Meanwhile, PALSAR pairs were also applied to test the amplitude tracking method in the same manner. To address the temporal difference between the acquisition of SAR and optical images, the velocity vectors considering seasonal mean migration were interpolated. At last, the outputs from analyses were incorporated to build an effective 3D movement tracing over Russell glacier.\nFurthermore, in order to investigate the glacial migration process, the hydrodynamic simulations employing optical stereo pairs and InSAR DTMs over meltwater outflow channels, such as Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua and Qinnguata Kuussua from Russell glacier, were conducted simultaneously with the tracking of the geometric movement of glacier. The overall results were anticipated to be incorporated for the understanding of long term change of Russell glacier. Based on the output of this case study, the proposed method will be extended into a comprehensive scheme to tackle the issues of ice sheet change occurred in the Greenland.",

            "abstract": "The Selenga River delta, Lake Baikal, Russia, is approximately 700 km2 in size and contains three active lobes that receive varying amounts of water and sediment discharge. This delta represents a unique end-member in so far that the system is positioned along the deep-water (~1500 m) margin of Lake Baikal and therefore exists as a shelf-edge delta. In order to evaluate the morphological dynamics of the Selenga delta, field expeditions were undertaken during July 2013 and 2014, to investigate the morphologic, sedimentologic, and hydraulic nature of this delta system. Single-beam bathymetry data, sidescan sonar data, sediment samples, and aerial survey data were collected and analyzed to constrain: 1) channel geometries within the delta, 2) bedform sizes and spatial distributions, 3) grain size composition of channel bed sediment as well as bank sediment, collected from both major and minor distributary channels, and 4) elevation range of the subaerial portion of the delta. Our data indicate that the delta possesses downstream sediment fining, ranging from predominantly gravel and sand near the delta apex to silt and sand at the delta-lake interface. Field surveys also indicate that the Selenga delta has both eroding and aggrading banks, and that the delta is actively incising into some banks that consist of terraces, which are defined as regions that are not inundated by typical 2- to 4-year flood discharge events. Therefore the terraces are distinct from the actively accreting regions of the delta that receive sedimentation via water inundation during regular river floods. We spatially constrain the regions of the Selenga delta that are inundated during floods versus terraced using a 1-D water-surface hydrodynamic model that produces estimates of stage for flood water discharges, whereby local water surface elevations produced with the model are compared to the measured terrestrial elevations. Our analyses show that terrace elevations steadily decrease downstream for all lobes, and that the delta is undergoing an active phase of erosion, characterized by channel incision and extensive lateral erosion of terraces; this process of delta ‘self-cannibalization’ contributes to the downstream sediment flux and morphological evolution of the delta.",

            "abstract": "Published research continues to report that long-term, local-scale precipitation forecasts are too uncertain to support local-scale adaptation. Numerous studies quantify the range of uncertainty in downscaled model output; compare this with uncertainty from other sources such as hydrological modeling; and propose circumventing uncertainty via “soft” or “low regret” actions, or adaptive management. Yet non-structural adaptations alone are likely insufficient. Structural adaptation requires quantified engineering design specifications. However, the literature does not define a tolerable level of uncertainty. Without such a benchmark, how can we determine whether the climate-change-cognizant design specifications that we are capable of, for example the climate change factors increasingly utilized in European practice, are viable?\nThe presentation will explore this question, in the context of reporting results and observations from an ongoing ten-year program assessing local-scale stormwater drainage system vulnerabilities, required capacities, and adaptation options and costs. This program has studied stormwater systems of varying complexity in a variety of regions, topographies, and levels of urbanization, in northern-New England and the upper-Midwestern United States. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of local-scale design specifications, and provide tangible information on risk to enable valid cost/benefit decisions. The research program has found that stormwater planners and engineers have routinely accepted, in the normal course of professional practice, a level of uncertainty in hydrological modeling comparable to that in long-term precipitation projections. Moreover, the ability to quantify required capacity and related construction costs for specific climate change scenarios, the insensitivity of capacity and costs to uncertainty, and the percentage of pipes and culverts that never require upsizing, all serve to limit the impact of uncertainty inherent in climate change projections.",

Adaptation measures are available for many health impacts in the US, but they may not be able to completely prevent impacts, especially if climate change becomes more severe in the future. And many measures undertaken to limit greenhouse gas emissions or increase resilience to climate impacts in other sectors have the potential to improve, or in some cases, harm, human health.

Seismic reflection profiles bound on the south by the transpressional North Altyn Fault (NAF) and on the north by the strike-slip dominated transpressional Cherchen Fault, obtained in a grid of 20 km-spaced parallel and 10 km-spaced perpendicular lines to these two major structures. Among the major features apparent on the seismic sections are: 1) a southwest-northeast trending anticline bound on the north by a minor reverse fault, 2) a basal Cenozoic angular unconformity evident as a major reflective horizon and confirmed with borehole data from the RC1 well, also verifying the thickness of Cenozoic aged sediments at <3500 m throughout SE Tarim, 3) minor reverse faults with minimal (< 500 m) cumulative vertical offset in early Cenozoic strata, 4) depth to crystalline basement of ~3500 m, evident from the lack of seismic horizons (reflections) below Jurassic aged strata. Though identifiable structures are few within SE Tarim, reconstructions of the structures shown in seismic sections indicate that a maximum of 1.5 km of crustal shortening has occurred in the southeast Tarim Basin throughout the Cenozoic, less than that necessary for a major thrust system. Quantifying this shortening helps to characterize the deformation within the footwall block of the NAF, constraining the maximum vertical component of offset on the NAF as less than the maximum vertical thickness of Cenozoic sediments in SE Tarim of ~3500 m, observations that suggest minimal vertical offset (<3 km) on the NAF. 1 Seismic section that extends north of the Cherchen Fault shows that the pattern of minimal deformation in SE Tarim extends north of this major structure, further solidifying the results showing minimal deformation within the Tarim Basin.",

            "abstract": "The next rover mission to Mars represents the culmination of almost two decades of strategic missions in the exploration of Mars. Our understanding of the Red Planet has evolved from a global frozen desert to a dynamic world that once was warmer, wetter, and could have supported microbial life, and the series of missions reflect this evolution, moving from global reconnaissance to seeking the signs of life. The 2020 rover will be outfitted with seven sophisticated payload elements to conduct remote sensing and contact science, demonstrate exploration technology, and cache samples for potential return to Earth. The mission’s capabilities exceed the threshold mission detailed in the Mars 2020 Science Definition Team 2013 report1 and meets the NRC’s 2011 Decadal Survey’s requirements for the highest priority mission of NASA’s Planetary Science2. The instruments selected July 31, 2014, are able to determine elemental composition and mineralogy and detect organic compounds across spatial scales of meters to 100’s of micrometers. The instrument suite includes a combination of a zooming, binocular, multi-spectral camera; a telescopic imager; two Raman spectrometers with different wavelength lasers (UV and Green); a visible/near-infrared spectrometer; a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer; an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a microscopic imager, and ground-penetrating radar. Their purpose is to enable the science team to establish the geological context of the landing site area, to assess whether past or present environments could support microbial life, to search for potential biosignatures, and to use this information to identify samples for caching. To prepare for future human exploration, the payload includes the ability for in situ resource utilization, converting CO2 to O2, the ability to assess physical characteristics of the dust, and environmental monitoring of the temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, and radiation. The Mars 2020 mission will pave a significant portion of the path to Mars for scientific understanding and future human exploration. We will detail the mission's scientific and exploration technology objectives and the payload assembled to accomplish these goals.",

            "abstract": "Suborbital astronomical observations have over 50 years' history using NASA's sounding rockets and experimental space planes. The new commercial space industry is developing suborbital reusable launch vehicles (sRLV’s) to provide low-cost, flexible, and frequent access to space at ~100 km altitude. In the case of XCOR Aerospace’s Lynx spacecraft, the vehicle design and capabilities work well for hosting specially designed experiments that can be flown with a human-tended researcher or alone with the pilot on a customized mission. Some of the first-generation instruments and facilities that will conduct solar observations on dedicated Lynx science missions include the SwRI Solar Instrument Pointing Platform (SSIPP) and Atsa Suborbital Observatory, as well as KickSat sprites, which are picosatellites for in situ atmospheric and solar phenomena measurements. The SSIPP is a demonstration two-stage pointed solar observatory that operates inside the Lynx cockpit. The coarse pointing stage includes the pilot in the feedback loop, and the fine stage stabilizes the solar image to achieve arcsecond class pointing. SSIPP is a stepping-stone to future external instruments that can operate with larger apertures and shorter wavelengths in the solar atmosphere. The Planetary Science Institute’s Atsa Suborbital Observatory combines the strengths of ground-based observatories and space-based observing to create a facility where a telescope is maintained and used interchangeably with either in-house facility instruments or user-provided instruments. The Atsa prototype is a proof of concept, hand-guided camera that mounts on the interior of the Lynx cockpit to test target acquisition and tracking for human-operated suborbital astronomy. KickSat sprites are mass-producible, one inch printed circuit boards (PCBs) populated by programmable off the shelf microprocessors and radios for real time data transmission. The sprite PCBs can integrate chip-based radiometers, magnetometers, accelerometers, etc. This low-cost, customizable platform provides researchers the ability to design immediately responsive, repeatable, high resolution experiments.",

            "abstract": "Welded basaltic ignimbrites are one of the rarest forms of ignimbrites found on Earth and can often have characteristics that are indistinguishable from those of basaltic lava flows. This study evaluates a basaltic volcanic flow in a coastal cliff sequence in Raupo Bay, Akaroa Volcanic Complex, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. The Raupo Bay coastal cliff sequence is comprised of 4 units, termed L1, L2, L3, and A, capped by loess. L1 and L2 are basaltic lavas, L3 proximal scoria deposits, which thin inland, and Unit A, a flow with unusual characteristics, which is the focus of this study. Field mapping, sampling, geochemical analysis and petrology were utilized to characterize units. Further detailed structural analysis of Unit A was completed, to determine the nature of the basal contact, variations in welding throughout the unit and the relationship of the layer to the underlying topography. From these analyses it was found: Unit A is thickest in a paleo-valley and thins and mantles higher topography, welding in the unit increases downwards forming topographic controlled columnar jointing, the top of the unit is brecciated and grades into the lower welded/jointed portion, the basal contact is sharp overlying a regional airfall deposit, the unit has a notably distinct geochemical composition from the underlying stratigraphic units, Unit A contains flattened and sheared scoria clasts, has aligned bubbles, and lava lithics. Further thin section analysis of Unit A identified flattened clast boundaries and microlite rimming around phenocrysts. In comparing these features to previous studies on basaltic lavas and ignimbrites it is hypothesized that Unit A is a welded basaltic ignimbrite that was channelized by paleo-topography on the outer flanks of the Akaroa Volcanic Complex. This study furthers the characterization of basaltic ignimbrites and is the first to recognize basaltic ignimbrites within the Akaroa Volcanic Complex.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are important carbon sinks that exist at continental margins and act as mediators in the exchange of nutrients and carbon between terrestrial and marine environments. Within salt marshes, 10-20% of total surface area is covered by marshtop ponds. The fractional area of marshtop ponds is predicted to increase as sea level rises. Despite their potential importance, the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes within such ponds remain poorly understood. To quantify the balance of metabolic fluxes within salt marsh ponds, chemical fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in July, 2014 in benthic flux chambers inserted into a salt marsh pond in the Plum Island Estuary Long-Term Ecosystem Research (PIE-LTER) site. Light and dark chambers were used to enable separation of rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Separate chambers were used to enclose sediment covered by primarily benthic microalgae and primarily benthic macroalgae. Net ecosystem metabolism in the microalgae was ~10 and in the macroalgae ~15 mmol C/m2/hour. Respiration rates were ~10 mmol C/m2/ hour for both microalgae and macroalgae. The resulting fluxes of net ecosystem production in the ponds will be compared with overall marsh net ecosystem flux as measured by an eddy flux tower that was located 100 meters from the pond. Additionally, concurrent measurements of DIC and DO allow quantification of the C:O ratio during respiration (i.e. respiratory quotient) in this system.",

            "abstract": "The Central Gneiss Complex, located in western British Columbia, preserves mid and lower crustal igneous and metasedimentary rocks that yield insight into deformational and thermal processes at the roots of a continental magmatic arc. The complex primarily consists of gneiss interpreted as a volcanic sequence with calcareous interlayers and lesser clastic metasedimentary rocks. Cretaceous U-Pb zircon ages from granulite-facies equivalent rocks in the core of the complex hint at rapid burial following deposition. However, a Permian or older crinoid fossil found in one locality (Hill, 1985) requires the presence of some late Paleozoic or early Mesozoic material. A new U-Pb zircon age (313±5 Ma; LA-ICPMS) from ~10 km west of this fossil locality is interpreted to record volcanism. We also conducted focused structural and geochronological analysis at higher structural levels in the northeastern Central Gneiss Complex to positively identify sedimentary lithologies with which to document the early structural history of the complex prior to early Cenozoic rapid exhumation. In this area, a subhorizontal shear zone forms the boundary between mainly clastic metasedimentary rocks and the widespread metavolcanic and carbonate rocks where an important stretched pebble conglomerate has been previously documented. In the footwall of the shear zone, flattening fabrics transition structurally upward into E-W trending stretching lineations, lineation-parallel isoclinal fold axes, and boudinage that record E-W stretching and major shear strain near the contact. S-C fabrics and shear bands yield a top to the east sense of shear. Where observed, a shallowly dipping, ~15 m thick zone of cataclasite forms the lithologic contact and overprints the shear zone. Sills and dikes record ongoing but localized magmatism throughout deformation and steep NE striking brittle normal faults crosscut all features. Ongoing work will further constrain the protolith age of these rocks, the timing of deformation, and whether the shear zone is a folded low angle normal fault \u0004\u0005or instead related to regional thrust burial. This will yield insight into sediment burial and metamorphism at subduction zones and its potential influence on magmatic arc productivity and middle and lower crustal deformation processes.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is a key factor for salmonid health and is an important restoration metric on the Middle Fork of the John Day River, northeast Oregon. The longest undammed tributary to the Columbia, the headwaters of the Middle Fork are crucial to steelhead and spring Chinook and summer Chinook juvenile rearing. In the past century the river has been altered by dredge mining, overgrazing, logging activities, and irrigation resulting in bank erosion, low effective shade, and channelization. These factors decreased fish habitat and led to increased stream temperature maxima. Restoration has focused on restoring fish habitat, creating thermal refugia, and planting native vegetation. The most recent completed restoration project diverted the flow into the historic, meandering stream channel from the dredged, straightened channel.\nOver the past seven years, Oregon State University researchers (Tara O’Donnell-2012, Julie Huff-2009) have been involved in a planned-to-be 10-year stream temperature monitoring study to assess maximum temperatures during low-flow summer months. The use of fiber optics through distributed temperature sensing (DTS) made it possible to record high resolution temperature data at both temporal and spatial scales; data which is used to assess the efficacy of restoration efforts on the reach. Furthermore, DTS provided temperature data that reveals subtle hydrologic processes such as groundwater or hyporheic inflows and quantifies their effect on the stream. Current research has focused on large scale DTS installations on the Middle Fork of the John Day River on the Oxbow, Forrest, and the upstream Galena (“RPB”) conservation properties. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, 16 km of river were monitored.\nOur study compares temperatures before and after the restoration project and provides essential guidance for future restoration projects. Direct comparisons coupled with a deterministic modeling using HeatSource assist in better understanding the responsiveness of the stream to restoration. Results showed that reconstructing the stream channel influenced stream temperature as a function of modifying channel geometry, hydraulics, and riparian conditions. Special attention in this work is focused on the role of tributary fans in the creation of distributed cold-water emergences.",

Two cosmic ray probes from the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), operating since 2010 at heavily instrumented sites in Oklahoma, offer a special opportunity to examine soil moisture across different scales. One probe was installed at the ARM Southern Great Plains site near Lamont, OK, and the other at the SMAP in situ Test Bed near Stillwater, OK. Point samples taken within and adjacent to the footprint of the probes show a remarkable variability at each site, whereas the timeseries for the two probes are remarkably consistent, both in terms of dynamics and absolute values, despite the 80 km separation between the probes.

            "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions constitute one of the most uncertain aspects of anthropogenic climate change estimates. The magnitude of these interactions as represented in climate models strongly depends on the process of aerosol activation. This process is the most direct physical link between aerosols and cloud microphysical properties. Calculation of droplet number in GCMs requires the computation of new droplet formation (i.e., droplet activation), through physically based activation parameterizations. Considerable effort has been placed in ensuring that droplet activation parameterizations have a physically consistent response to changes in aerosol number concentration. However, recent analyses using an adjoint sensitivity approach showed that parameterizations can exhibit considerable biases in their response to other aerosol properties, such as aerosol modal diameter or to the aerosol chemical composition. This is a potentially important factor in estimating aerosol indirect effects since changes in aerosol properties from pre-industrial times to present day exhibit a very strong regional signature. In this work we use the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) to show that the regional imprint of the changes in aerosol properties during the last century interacts with the droplet activation parameterization in a way that these biases are amplified over climatically relevant regions. Two commonly used activation routines, the CAM5 default, Abdul-Razzak and Ghan parameterization, as well as the Fountoukis and Nenes parameterization are used in this study. We further explored the impacts of Nd parameterization biases in the first and second aerosol indirect effects separately, by performing simulations were droplet number was not allowed to intervene in the precipitation initiation process. The simulations performed show that an unphysical response to changes in the diameter of accumulation mode aerosol translates into extremely high Nd concentrations over South-East Asia, producing a dramatic effect on the second aerosol indirect effect. The strength of the indirect effect over South-East Asia was shown to be a dominant factor in the global estimate of aerosol indirect effect in the CAM5 model.",

As with upwelling off the US West Coast, these events can transport acidified water to the surface and shoreward. To determine if upwelling events have the potential to impact shellfish hatcheries in New Jersey, a monitoring study was conducted at the Aquaculture Innovation Center (AIC) of Rutgers University. The AIC is an important hatchery supporting the New Jersey oyster aquaculture industry through the production of disease resistant seed oysters. Starting in June of 2014, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were continuously monitored at the AIC’s intake pipe. Periodic grab samples were also collected at the intake and at locations within the facility. Grab samples were preserved and analyzed for pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). DIC and pH were used to calculate the aragonite saturation state of the sampled water. During an upwelling event in early July a drop in pH was measured at the intake. Grab samples showed that water of lower pH and aragonite saturation was entering the facility. These results show that hatcheries along the NJ coast need to be aware that upwelling events may bring conditions detrimental for shellfish production.",

Korea has ambitiously set its 2nd phase capitol air quality improvement program called Seoul metropolitan area Air Quality Management Plan(SAQMP), targeting the year 2024. The air quality improvement targets for the year 2024 are 30 ug/m3 and 20 ug/m3 for PM10 and pm2.5, respectively and planned expenditure are almost 4 billion US dollar. Emissions of PM10, PM2.5 are required to be decreased up to 35%, 45%, respectively, from their future baseline level. Various special measures, such as cap-and-trade, LNB, EURO standards program, will be implemented to control emissions over Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi-do area. Smart approach of reducing air pollution and GHGs are, however, required to maximize improvement of metropolitan air quality and climate change. IIASA’s Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions aNd Synergies(GAINS) modeling framework is an widely used tool to design and manage smart emission control strategies that can achieve air quality/climate improvements with least costs. We have developed the national version of GAINS for Korea (GAINS-Korea) to set up those strategies for national and regional scale. In this study, we have implemented SAQMP in the GAINS-Korea Model and assess its effects of emissions reduction and air quality improvements. Various analysis results using the framework will be presented at site.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of fault slip rates based on geodetic data rely on measurements that represent the long-term deformation of the crust. In the Central Walker Lane/Sierra Nevada transition, the Long Valley Caldera region has experienced multiple episodes of uplift and subsidence during the last four decades. The latest episode began in late 2011 and is detectable as a transient signal in the time series of GPS stations around the caldera. These transient signals become more apparent and reveal the extent of the impact on the ambient crustal deformation field of the Walker Lane when the velocity vectors are transformed to a Sierra-Nevada reference frame. Estimating contemporary slip-rates on faults for the purpose of seismic hazard assessment in the region around Long Valley requires detecting and subtracting the transient signals caused by the uplift and subsidence in the caldera.\nWe estimate the geographic extent to which the ambient crustal deformation field is significantly perturbed by ongoing magmatic activity in Long Valley. We present a time variable 3D deformation field constrained by InSAR and GPS observations, and discuss the implications that tectonic-magmatic interaction have for estimates of present-day fault slip-rate. We model the time dependent deformation at Long Valley by analyzing InSAR time series from Envisat and ERS interferograms spanning a period of more than 19 years. We use an analytical volcano deformation source model derived from vertical (GPS) and line of site (InSAR) component of geodetic observations to estimate the horizontal component of the signals associated with magmatic activity beneath the caldera. Previous studies showed that the latest episode of uplift can be modeled with a Mogi source located at a depth of ~6 km with a volume change of 0.03 km3 beneath the resurgent dome. This model predicts a perturbation to the ambient crustal deformation field extending as far as 60 km from the center of the resurgent dome. Thus the area affected by Long Valley extends from north of Mono Lake southward to Owens Lake, and eastward to the Mina deflection of the Walker Lane, potentially influencing the estimated slip rates for a dozen or more major faults.",

            "abstract": "Coastal wetlands, including salt marshes, are considered to be large carbon sinks. Yet, there is little knowledge about how the terrain and land cover of these environments are related to carbon distribution. An understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon held in both the biomass and soil, and the factors that influence its distribution, will be necessary to allow coastal managers to initiate and verify “Blue Carbon” projects. In this study, we attempt to understand: 1) the temporal changes in salt marsh distributions as affected by marsh submergence, vertical accretion and land cover conversions; 2) patterns of soil carbon across different depths of the soil profile; and 3) to evaluate how changes in relative water level governs the spatial and temporal variability of salt marsh carbon storage ability. Our results indicate that over the study period (1954 to present) a considerable portion of salt marsh extents were submerged, while at the higher terrains these salt marshes indicated a landward shift in response to the sea level rise. Soil carbon measured in the soil profile, revealed a gradual depletion of soil carbon with depth. However, both the soil bulk density and the percent carbon indicated an abrupt and significant change at a depth of 15cm (p=0.05), which we interpreted as distinct of two different environments. As evidenced by historical aerial imagery (1954, 1969), the first (15-30 cm depth) coincided with an unvegetated salt flat at the sample locations, which were then overlain by lower bulk density and higher carbon Spartina alterniflora low marsh (0-15 cm depth) that migrated upslope in response to rapid relative sea level rise. However, within each of these two environments separately, carbon distribution followed a unique pattern with respect to elevation. Our results further point to two different processes, each acting at a different time scale (daily tides versus relative sea level rise), and each results in distinct spatial patterns of carbon deposition with respect to elevation. Thus, local and regional Blue Carbon projects or management actions, and global scale accounting of soil carbon, will need to consider both elevation and sea level history to predict carbon distribution.",

            "abstract": "Topographic reconstruction is a high priority task for the solid planet and satellite exploration missions. Laser/radar altimetry and stereo analyses have been widely used for this purpose and achieve high quality 3D topographic data over various planetary surfaces such as Venus, Mercury, Moon and Mars. However, in contrast with inner planet and satellite, the base data sets to compose digital topography over outer planets and satellites are very limited.\nTitan, the largest satellite of Saturn has also too limited data inventory to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in topographic data, in spite of increasing interests about the detailed topography owing to the recent interesting discoveries on methane fluvial system, aeolian geomorphologies and possible tectonic activity.\nTherefore the endeavours to increase the coverage of digital topography employing radargrammetry (Kirk et al. 2009), radar altimetry (Elachi, et al. 2005) and SARtopo (Stiles et al. 2009) have been actively conducted. Although these efforts result in the construction of a global topographic map, the consequent spatial resolutions of global topography are still poor (Lorentz et al. 2013).\nIn this study, we tried to improve the coverage and the quality of Titan digital terrain model employing approaches as follows; 1) A semi-automated stereo matching scheme manipulating low signal-to-noise SAR image pair incorporating adaptive filtering and base topography, 2) the geodetic control improvement of stereo SAR pair based on altimetric measurements, 3) introduction of radarclinometry to refine the topography from stereo analyses. Especially together with the technical improvements to exploit SAR stereo pair, the possibility to mine height information from Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) was actively explored by the means of hybrid stereogrammetry between VIMS and SAR image pairs and photoclinometry. The developed scheme was applied for a few testing areas especially over Xanadu which is the largest topographic feature over Titan and well covered by SAR and VIMS. The constructed topography revealed many interesting geomorphic features such as drainage networks and rugged terrains in detail. To fully demonstrate the potential of these approaches, technical details will be continuously improved.",

            "abstract": "We present recent spectropolarimetric observations of eleven B- and C-type asteroids using SPOL (http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/SPOL/) at the 2.3-m Bok and 1.6-m Kuiper telescopes. Our primary goal is to further constrain our understanding of the wavelength dependence of linear polarization. For each object, we produced polarimetric phase curves (linear polarization vs. phase angle) and measure the wavelength dependence in each observation by calculating the slope of each polarization spectrum. Previous analysis by Belskaya et al. (2009) shows that the slope of the polarization spectrum increases as the wavelength increases. No analysis of the wavelength dependence in B-types has occurred previously to our knowledge. For the five C-type (3 Ch- and 2 C-) objects observed, those of the Ch-type have larger minimum polarizations than of the C- subtype. This is consistent with polarimetric phase curves of similar asteroids by Gil-Hutton and Cañada-Assandri (2012). With respect to the wavelength dependence, our observed targets show an increase in polarization slope with wavelength, confirming the Belskaya (2009) result. After dividing the data by group, C- subtype objects have relatively flat polarization spectra, as opposed to the Ch- subtypes that have more rapidly changing slopes as phase angle increases. A mineralogical basis for the variety of wavelength dependences observed is most likely. Additional observations of the other C- subtypes will aid to distinguish how mineralogical variation affects polarization. It may also explain the wide range of polarization slopes measured near a phase angle of ten degrees in the Belskaya (2009) analysis. Six B-type asteroids were observed in a similar manner. As with the C-types, the polarimetric phase curves vary in shape, suggesting differences in albedo. Also, the wavelength dependence increases with wavelength, as shown for the C-types. On the other hand, all of the B-type objects have a similar wavelength dependence trend with phase angle regardless of its polarization curve; there is a steady increase in polarization slope with phase angle for all objects. Results such as these will hopefully provide additional constraints to theoretical work related to regolith scattering processes.",

            "abstract": "Degradation in drylands is often triggered by shifts induced by feedbacks between coevolving hydrology, vegetation, soils and geomorphic processes. These feedbacks affect the redistribution of surface runoff and therefore the emergent patterns of vegetation and landscape connectivity. Existing theories explaining ecohydrology shifts in semiarid areas with patchy vegetation focus on biomass-water interactions but do not explicitly account for feedbacks with evolving landform and soil depths. Here we study the observed ecohydrologic response of patchy semiarid areas in Australia and Spain, analysing interactions between PFTs traits and landform processes.\nWe further use a mechanistic modelling framework to investigate the role of coevolving soil depths on the stability and resilience of these systems. We find that areas with deeper soils tend to display more regular vegetation patterns and their resilience and recovery after an initial disturbance are strongly affected by plant facilitation strategies. However for ecosystems in steep areas, feedback effects with landforms become stronger, and sudden changes in connectivity can easily lead to degradation. In contrast, we show that for shallow soils, plant facilitation effects become less important and vegetation patterns are irregular. In this case, soil depth becomes the key factor prescribing surface connectivity and recovery of the system after disturbance. These results have critical implications for effective management and restoration efforts, and for understanding the effects of changes in climate and land use.",

            "abstract": "Variation in plant species traits, such as photosynthetic and hydraulic properties, can indicate vulnerability or resilience to climate change, and feed back to broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemistry, demographics, and biogeography. Yet, predicting how vegetation will respond to future environmental changes is severely limited by the inability of our models to represent species-level trait variation in processes and properties, as current generation process-based models are mostly based on the generalized and abstracted concept of plant functional types (PFTs) which were originally developed for hydrological modeling. For example, there are close to 11,000 grass species, but most vegetation models have only a single C4 grass and one or two C3 grass PFTs. However, while species trait databases are expanding rapidly, they have been produced mostly from unstructured research, with a focus on easily researched traits that are not necessarily the most important for determining plant function. Additionally, implementing realistic species-level trait variation in models is challenging. Combining related and ecologically similar species in these models might ameliorate this limitation. Here we argue for an intermediate, lineage-based approach to PFTs, which draws upon recent advances in gene sequencing and phylogenetic modeling, and where trait complex variations and anatomical features are constrained by a shared evolutionary history. We provide an example of this approach with grass lineages that vary in photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4) and other functional and structural traits. We use machine learning approaches and geospatial databases to infer the most important environmental controls and climate niche variation for the distribution of grass lineages, and utilize a rapidly expanding grass trait database to demonstrate examples of lineage-based grass PFTs. For example, grasses in the Andropogoneae are typically tall species that dominate wet and seasonally burned ecosystems, whereas Chloridoideae grasses are associated with semi-arid regions. These two C4 lineages are expected to respond quite differently to climate change, but are often modelled as a single PFT.",

Mixed layer tracer ages range from close to zero to ca. 5 years with most of the ages grouping around 2.5 years. The tracer ages increase rapidly through the halocline waters (roughly 10 years at about 100 and 20 years close to 200 meters depth, respectively) and typically reach their maximum values close to the depth of the core of the Atlantic Water (up to 35 years). Within the AW there are large lateral gradients with higher ages found in the boundary current along the slope of the Canadian Archipelago, and lower ages prevalent close to the North Pole. We also observe temporal variability in the age tracer distributions, mainly in the lateral gradient of the ages in the AW layer. We discuss the age tracer results in the context of the circulation and mean residence times of waters in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean and their variability.

            "abstract": "Interacting with hearing impaired students who communicate using auditory/oral methods provides challenges and opportunities to education/outreach activities. Despite many advances in assistive technologies, these hearing impaired students will learn much less incidentally than their peers with typical hearing. In other words, they will often require repeated auditory and perhaps visual reinforcement in order to learn a new word or a new concept. This need leads to a much more deliberate and conscious interaction between educators or scientists and the students. We are reporting from a unique joint project between the Sunshine Cottage School for Deaf Children and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), to bring actual space research to life for hearing impaired elementary school students. During this project, we combined the unique capabilities of Deaf Education educators with the excitement and wonder of researching the northern lights. For three consecutive winters, we conducted a series of informal yet structured activities each year with fourth and fifth grade students. Our interactions went beyond typical classroom activities and readily available educational materials. Our goal was to engage and excite the students. To do so, we set up a series of interactions and mini-projects that introduced the students to actual research and actual researchers. From \"meet the scientists\" visits to school over a field trip to the SwRI space research facilities to observing and predicting the aurora using real-time space weather data, we engaged students in the \"who\" and \"how\" of doing research and field work in Alaska's winter. Over the course of this project, students connected with a remote school in the interior of Alaska, participated in the excitement of a NASA sounding rocket campaign in in Poker Flat, AK, skyped with researchers and students in Alaska, and made aurora predictions using NOAA real time space weather data. The highlight of the program each year was the in-school overnight camp-out in February, where we attempted to observe the aurora occurring real-time in Alaska. In this presentation, we discuss the challenges and lessons learned from this project, focusing particularly on the lessons learned from the hearing impaired students that would directly benefit more typical school settings.",

            "abstract": "We study a mechanism of iceberg breakup that may act together with the recognized melt and wave-induced decay processes. Our proposal is based on observations from a recent field experiment on a large ice island in Baffin Bay, East Canada. We observed that successive collapses of the overburden from above an unsupported wavecut at the iceberg waterline created a submerged foot fringing the berg. The buoyancy stresses induced by such a foot may be sufficient to cause moderate-sized bergs to break off from the main berg. A mathematical model is developed to test the feasibility of this mechanism. The results suggest that once the foot reaches a critical length, the induced stresses are sufficient to cause calving. The theoretically predicted maximum stable foot length compares well to the data collected in situ. Further, the model provides analytical expressions for the previously observed ‘rampart-moat’ iceberg surface profiles. Finally, we comment on the implications for the calving of icebergs from shelf fronts, where similar underwater ‘feet’ have been observed.",

            "abstract": "Communities in the NW arctic rely on subsistence activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering to ensure their food security and to maintain a cultural identity but climate change is altering the timing and distribution of plants and animals. Arctic Alaskan villages are only accessible by air or watercraft thus limiting the options of goods and services and increasing the cost due to vast distances traveled. Additionally, these goods and services must be transported during winter months, which include some of the most extreme temperatures and landscapes people permanently occupy. Many rural community members mitigate these high food prices by maintaining their traditional lifestyle of hunting fishing and gathering of marine mammals, fish, greens and berries.\nThese essential subsistence activities are impacted by a warming arctic as reduced sea ice extent, permafrost thaw, increased storm severity and shifting seasonality alters plant and animal patterns that people in the region have knowledge about for thousands of years. Now with increased weather variability and a changing climate the people in the region are adapting and responding to these changes. Local traditional knowledge (LTK) of active hunters, fishers, and gatherers can provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding to western science of how climate change is impacting the Arctic. This documentary film captures footage from the summer and fall of 2013 of activities of hunters fishers and gatherers and recorded their sentiments of how climate changes has impacted their subsistence way of life, and how arctic residence are responding to both climate and extreme weather events. Video is taken from the land, sea and air in and around Kotzebue, Kivalina, Point Hope, Noatak, Ambler, Buckland and Deering. The presenters will discuss how the film shows responses to change and how the film was made in close collaboration with NW arctic residents.",

Yet the upper ocean variability in the Southern Ocean remains poorly understood due to sparse in situ measurements. In this study we use a Southern Ocean state estimate developed for the years 2005 to 2010 to describe the spatial and temporal variability of the upper 400m of the Drake Passage region. We focus primarily on ocean heat content and mixed layer depth, and utilize a unique algorithm for finding mixed layer depth that examines steep density gradients within the region.

            "abstract": "This study used ground-based hyperspectral remote sensing data to map rock alterations and lithologies at Semail Ophiolite, Oman, as well as hydrocarbon-induced rock alterations at Cement, Oklahoma. The Samail Ophiolite exposed the largest, least-deformed, and the most-studied ophiolite in the world. Hydrocarbon seepages at Cement, Oklahoma brought hydrocarbons to the Rush Springs sandstones at surface, and generated rock alterations including bleaching of red beds, and carbonate cementation. Surficial expressions of rock alterations and different lithofacies are distinct from adjacent rocks, and can be detected by remote sensing techniques.\nHyperspectral remote sensing acquires light intensity for hundreds of bands in a continuous electromagnetic spectrum from visible light to short-wave infrared radiation, and holds potential to characterize rocks with great precision. Ground-based hyperspectral study could scan the objects at close ranges thus provide very fine spatial resolutions (millimeters to centimeters). This study mapped all the major iconic outcrops of Semail ophiolite including pillow lava, sheeted dykes, layered gabbros, and peridotites. This study also identified surficial rock alterations induced by hydrocarbons at Cement, Oklahoma. Reddish-brown Rush Spring sandstones are bleached to pink, yellow, and gray colors; pore spaces in the sandstones have been filled with carbonate cementation. Laboratory spectroscopy was used to assist with mineral identification and classification in hyperspectral data. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to provide high-accuracy spatial references. Principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, spectral angle mapper, and band ratios are used in image processing. Combining lithological, remote sensing and geochemical data, this study built a model for petroleum seepage and related rock alterations, and provided a workflow for employing ground-based hyperspectral remote sensing techniques in petrological study as well as resource exploration.",

            "abstract": "India is poised to become the most populous country in the world by 2019 and reach a population of over 2 billion by 2050 based on current growth rates. It is also a region which will be under severe socio-economic and environmental stress if mitigation efforts are not adapted. In the past 10 years the population of India has grown by an average rate of 17 million people per year. In addition to unprecedented population growth, rapid urbanization and industrialization are straining the overburdened environmental system. This rapid growth in population, urbanization and industrialized will result in increased demand for food, requiring expansion of agricultural resources. Since total agricultural land in India has been relatively constant over the past 10 years the demand for additional food has to be partly met by enhanced production on existing land. Arable land in India has declined by around 3% according to FAOSTAT while the total agricultural area under irrigation has increased by about 9% thus further straining its water resources. In addition projections for future climate indicate that India is one of the regions where water resources are expected to be negatively impacted. Total agriculture water withdrawal in India increased by approximately 18 % from 2000-2010 while the total per capita water withdrawal increased by over 9% from 2000-2010. Total freshwater withdrawal as percentage of renewable water resources was around 40% in 2010. In addition, recent mandates of biofuel policies in India are also expected to impact its water resources. The combined impact of these various factors on future water availability in India could be one of the most severe globally due its unprecedented increase in population, food production and industrialization. In this study we assess the impact of land use and climate change on water resources over southern India in the face of a growing population and interest in development of national biofuel supplies. We use observational data on historical climate and land use, and future climate projections to drive a coupled hydrological-crop simulation model to quantify these changes and asses their impacts.",

In this study we aim to analyze the in situ measurements taken by dropsondes in and around a February 2014 AR over the course of several days, which produced heavy precipitation in Northern California. We find, as in other AR case studies, that the high magnitude winds in the form of low level jets (LLJs) with unusually high water vapor content and stable air masses interact with coastal mountains to produce heavy precipitation near the coast. This study compares the dropsonde observations with NCEP Final Analysis data and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model outputs. In particular, we compare the forecasts of integrated vapor transport (IVT) against that which was measured by the dropsondes. Model forecasts and observation data of IVT will be presented at the AGU Fall Meeting.",

Recent work (Zhang et al. 2014; O’Brien et al. 2014) presents TEX86 derived SSTs that show higher temperatures in the Pacific warm pool of the early Pliocene compared to Uk’37 and Mg/Ca SST records. While TEX86 is subject to several limitations, include a relatively large calibration error and an uncertain depth of production, the data suggest that a strong zonal temperature gradient in the equatorial Pacific was maintained in the hotter world of the early Pliocene in contrast to previous work. Here we present preliminary, low-resolution TEX86 data from 30 sites with previously published Uk’37 or Mg/Ca records from the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The interval from 16 Ma to 2 Ma is targeted to capture the transition from the hothouse of the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum to the icehouse of the late Pliocene. Both zonal and meridional SST gradients are evaluated and the three temperature proxies are compared to investigate when and in what conditions discrepancies occur, particularly focusing on upwelling zones in the deep tropics.",

            "abstract": "Cassini has determined three important gravitational coefficients for Enceladus, J2, C22 and J3 (Iess et al., Science 344, 78). The gravity field is non-hydrostatic to 3σ (J2/C22 = 3.38–3.63, as opposed to 10/3). Iess et al. interpret these in terms of a hydrostatic interior (core) and isostatic (not hydrostatic) floating ice shell. The hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic contributions are separated by assuming the isostatic compensation depth is the same for each gravity term, although this can’t be strictly true in the case of a regional south polar sea. The inferred normalized moment-of-inertia (0.335) implies a core density of 2340–2400 kg/m3, consistent with a highly hydrated and oxidized (sulfate-rich) core, or more plausibly (in a cosmochemical sense), a porous, water-saturated core. The long-term stability of such porosity is questionable, however. Modest topography on a more indurated core could significantly contribute to the gravity signal. For example, if Enceladus’ core density were 3000 kg/m3, excess topography of only 1 km amplitude could provide the same “hydrostatic” J2 component as modeled in Iess et al. (and requires only 0.1 MPa of stress support). There is also the question of compensation depth of the ice shell. Different formalisms for spherical shells exist in the literature (e.g., Lambeck vs. Turcotte); Iess et al. follow the former and derive a 30-to-40-km thick shell at the south pole, whereas the Turcotte formalism gives a shell only 18-25-km thick. We pay particular attention to this issue, and note a thinner shell would be more mechanically compatible with the spacing of the “tiger stripes,” if the fissures are indeed crevasses open to the ocean below.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a common ecosystem perturbation that affects many soil physical and chemical properties and soil organic matter (SOM). We investigated the effect of combustion temperatures on the physical and chemical properties of five soils from an elevation transect that spans from 210 to 2865 m.a.s.l. along the Western slope of the Sierra Nevada. All soils formed on a granitic parent material under either oak woodland, oak/mixed-conifer forest, mixed-conifer forest or subalpine mixed-conifer forest ecosystem. Soils show significant differences in SOM content and mineralogy owing to the effects of climate on soil development. Soils from 0 to 5 cm depth were combusted in a muffle furnace at six different temperatures within major fire intensity classes (150, 250, 350, 450, 550 and 650ºC). We determined the effects of combustion temperature on aggregation; specific surface area; pH; mineralogy; cation exchange capacity; carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content; 13C and 15N isotopic composition, and distribution within aggregate sizes; and quality of SOM through infrared spectroscopy. Among other things, we found significant reduction total C and N, accumulation of aromatic carbon functional groups, and loss of aggregation with implication to loss of protection of C as the combustion temperature increases. The findings demonstrate that most significant changes in the soils physical and chemical properties occur around 350ºC. Findings from this study are critical for estimating the amount and rate of change in C and N loss, and other essential soil properties that can be expected from topsoils exposed to different intensity fires.",

            "abstract": "We use the newest generation of fully-coupled earth system models to study and contrast the response of Southern Ocean and Arctic phytoplankton productivity and biomass to 21st century climate change. The Arctic is warming at a rate much higher than the Southern high latitudes. Despite fundamental differences between the physical responses to climate in these regions, CMIP5 modes predict small increases in biological production both in the SO and the Arctic, partially compensating for the severe loss of primary production in the rest of the oceans.\nSouth of 40ºS, the CMIP5 models predict a complex, zonally-banded pattern of phytoplankton abundance and productivity changes driven by shifts in light and iron availability with future warming, in agreement with patterns and mechanisms emerging from a satellite trend analysis and other recent observational work. Increased SAM plays a major role in these projections, as increased Southern Ocean westerlies act both to increase mixing and phytoplankton light limitation in a band around 50S, and to modify iron supply to the surface in regions where phytoplankton are iron limited. By contrast, phytoplankton are light and nitrate co-limited in the strongly stratified Arctic ocean. Here we find that over 100 years, release of light limitation due to sea ice retreat is counter-balanced by an increase in nitrogen limitation due to increased stratification. While most models predict net increases in Arctic production by the end of the 21st century, the different strengths of nutrient-light co-limitation among models result in different magnitude changes in production across models.\nWe assess the multi-model 100-year trend significance using a novel technique based on bootstrap combined with a weighting scheme based in similarity across models.\nWe find that model uncertainty in ecological and biogeochemical parameters is higher than for the physical parameters. Additionally, the spread in model predictions is smaller than the spread in historical ecological and biogeochemical parameters.\nMore energy should be focused on improving simulations of ocean-atmosphere dynamics, biogeochemistry and ecology within the high latitudes, as the uncertainties and spread among models are larger in these regions compared to lower latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Topsoil and associated soil organic matter are continuously laterally distributed on the landscape by the process of soil erosion. The role of soil erosion on terrestrial carbon sequestration has been gaining a lot of attention over the last two decades. Soil erosion has been shown to lead to a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide in soil if at least some of the eroded carbon is replaced by production of new photosynthate and/or some of the eroded carbon is stabilized in downslope depositional landform positions. However, until recently most of the work in this area has been focused on agricultural or grassland systems. Here, we present results from temperate forested catchments in the southern part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We found that most of the soil organic matter eroded from low-order catchments in the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains is composed of forest floor material that has high concentrations of carbon. The steep slopes of these catchments also contribute to export of large proportion of the eroded forest floor material out of the catchments. Our radiocarbon analyses showed that the soil organic matter in the eroded material is composed of modern (post-1950) carbon with fraction modern values at or above 1. We also found that neither elevation, nor climate (across six years that we investigated) leads to significant changes in the composition and mean residence times of the eroded material, despite considerable differences in mean residence time of soil organic mater in soil profiles of the contributing hillslopes in the high vs. low elevation (low elevation: 1800 m, high elevation: 2300 m) catchments we studied. Our findings show that soil organic matter eroded from upland forested catchments is a lot more susceptible to decomposition, compared to organic matter eroded from agricultural or grassland systems likely leading to a less significant role of soil erosion on terrestrial carbon sequestration in forested catchments.",

Uncertainty remains in the simulations, including the identification of primary sources and secondary tracers, the understanding of the formation mechanisms, and the representation of the atmospheric evolution of OA. There have been limited ambient measurements available to test simulations that use elemental composition to constrain the sources and aging of OA. In this study, a large dataset including both surface, aircraft, and laboratory observations of the atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) and hydrogen-to-carbon (H:C) ratios of OA is synthesized and corrected for the bias of general Aerosol Mass Spectrometer elemental analysis. Mean observed O:C and H:C ratios range from 0.3 to 0.9 and 1.3 to 1.9, respectively, for the ground sites. Aircraft measurements show more oxidized OA with a vertical-level mean O:C of 1.2 and H:C of 1.4. We developed a global model simulation for the elemental composition of OA based on laboratory measurements. The standard GEOS-Chem simulation underestimates the O:C ratios, with the largest model bias in remote regions. Model performance is greatly improved by the addition of a laboratory-based oxidative-aging scheme. The revised simulations are best able to capture the observed variability of O:C in remote regions when the heterogeneous aging of secondary organic aerosol is introduced. The simulations underestimate the H:C ratios due to the gap between ambient and laboratory data. This suggests that that we may be missing sources and pathways which increase H:C, or alternatively, that laboratory experiments do not adequately mimic the ambient environment, and thus that their application in models may not reproduce field observations.",

With salinity varying from 500 mg/L TDS in streams fed from groundwater in low solubility sandstones, to 4000 mg/L TDS in streams fed from high solubility and gypsum bearing siltstones and mudstones, the role of geology on natural stream and groundwater chemistry is profound. Use of imported water from Northern California on urban landscapes that is isotopically distinct from locally sourced “native” waters provides an opportunity for students to trace and quantify the percentage of imported versus native water sources in the Santa Monica Mountains streams using stable water isotopes. Furthermore, the presence of natural selenium and uranium in certain types of strata and higher oxidation potential created by anthropogenic nitrate in groundwater provides students with opportunities to learn of trace element hydrochemistry and redox potential in natural and nutrient-contaminated strata. Teams of students have evaluated these processes in this exceptional natural hydrogeological laboratory in our Watershed Analysis, Field Methods, and Water Quality courses.

            "abstract": "Monazite and zircon U/Th–Pb dating and yttrium thermometry results from metapelitic rocks of the northern East Humboldt Range, Nevada provide insight into the tectonic evolution of the North American Cordillera. Combining a petrologic approach with in situ U/Th-Pb SHRIMP geochronology gives constraints on the timing and rates of burial and exhumation. When integrated with the results from studies of the intrusive igneous and structural evolution of a complexly deformed crustal block, a broad picture of the behavior of the thickened middle crust in an orogenic wedge begins to emerge. In samples from the upper limb of the south verging Winchell Lake nappe, monazite cores giving moderate YPO4 components yield a mean U–Pb age of 82.8 ± 1.3 Ma representing initial growth near garnet zone conditions. A cycle of burial and heating giving way to decompression and melting, followed by zircon growth accompanied by low YPO4 monazite growth giving a wide range of ages (77.1–62.4 Ma) apparently documents cooling and melt crystallization. Monazite core and zircon ages from these samples bracket the time frame for this cycle through peak pressure and then temperature. Rates of burial therefore are ~1.0­–4.5 mm/year for the Winchell Lake nappe. Migmatitic pelites from the Lizzies Basin area, structurally beneath the Winchell Lake nappe give U-Pb monazite age brackets of 96.5–79.4 Ma, yielding a narrower range of burial rates, ~0.5–2.0 mm/year. Calculated exhumation rates for the same rocks from both the upper limb of the Winchell Lake nappe and the Lizzies Basin area fall between ~0.4 and 1.7 mm/year. Rapid burial followed by rapid exhumation is consistent with thickening by an overthrust mechanism followed by vertical ductile thinning, underplating, erosion, and/or normal faulting. Exhumation is generally slower than estimates for exhumation of metamorphic core complexes north of the Snake River Plain calculated by Bendick and Baldwin (2009). This may represent a difference in the crustal structure or behavior from north to south during crustal thinning following peak Cordilleran thickness. Though this technique provides estimates of the rates of tectonic processes, the exact timing of peak pressure or temperature remains elusive.",

The goal is to train the next generation of planetary science mission leaders in a hands-on environment involving a wide range of engineers and scientists. It was established in 1989, and has undergone several incarnations. Initially a series of seminars, it became a more formal mission design experience in 1999. Admission is competitive, with participants given financial support.\nThe competitively selected trainees develop an early mission concept study in teams of 15-17, responsive to a typical NASA Science Mission Directorate Announcement of Opportunity. They select the mission concept from options presented by the course sponsors, based on high-priority missions as defined by the Decadal Survey, prepare a presentation for a proposal authorization review, present it to a senior review board and receive critical feedback. Each participant assumes multiple roles, on science, instrument and project teams. They develop an understanding of top-level science requirements and instrument priorities in advance through a series of reading assignments and webinars help trainees. Then, during the five day session at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, they work closely with concurrent engineers including JPL's Advanced Projects Design Team (\"Team X\"), a cross-functional multidisciplinary team of engineers that utilizes concurrent engineering methodologies to complete rapid design, analysis and evaluation of mission concept designs. All are mentored and assisted directly by Team X members and course tutors in their assigned project roles. There is a strong emphasis on making difficult trades, simulating a real mission design process as accurately as possible. The process is intense and at times dramatic, with fast-paced design sessions and late evening study sessions.\nA survey of PSSS alumni administered in 2013 provides information on the program’s impact on trainees’ career choices and leadership roles as they pursue their employment in planetary science and related fields. Results will be presented during the session, along with highlights of topics and missions covered since the program’s inception.",

            "abstract": "The objective of the effort reported here was the development of a method to extract the temporal signature and the individual periodic and quasi-periodic time-varying signals from proxy climate data. The effort was based on the assumption that the explicit delineation of each periodic term might ultimately be useful in helping to identify the mechanism for the 100-kyr glacial cycle in Quaternary proxy data. The method is an iterative application of both fixed and variable period filters scanned across the applicable portions of the data set. In the current application, the window for each filter is a single period wide, allowing for the maximum retention of the time-varying amplitude of the signal. An iterative process, including a time-series term, is required in order to counter the very broadband nature of the filter. Details of the method will be presented and the results of its application to the “LR04” Stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) will be discussed.  Graphical correlation of the individual signals with Obliquity, Precession, and Eccentricity (Laskar, et al, 2004) will be discussed. After removal of a constant from the data, the first thru third-order time series accounts for 75% of the variability in the data. Seven statistically justifiable periodic terms account for 94% of the remaining variability. The shortest period used was the 22.2 kyr average of the 3 precession period signals identified by spectrum analysis. A very strong obliquity driven term of 41.0 kyr was also observed as expected due to tuning of the data to that term. Averaging of the spectrum analysis data was used to determine a value of 96.05 kyr for the glacial cycle. The four remaining terms had periods between 180 and 2000 kyr and were determined using the variable period filters. Shorter period terms were not used because of their excessive requirements on the degrees of freedom available in the data set.",

LPI scientists have the opportunity to participate in Sky Fest events either by helping lead an activity or by giving the scientist presentation (a short lecture and/or demonstration).\nScientists are involved in at least one preparation meeting before the event. This allows them to ask questions, understand what activity they will be leading, and learn the key points that they should be sharing with the public, as well as techniques for effectively teaching members of the public about the event topic. During the event, each activity is run by one E/PO specialist and one scientist, enabling the scientist to learn about effective E/PO practices from the E/PO specialist and the E/PO specialist to get more science information about the event topic. E/PO specialists working together with scientists at stations provides a more complete, richer experience for event participants.\nSurveys of event participants have shown that interacting one-on-one with scientists is often one of their favorite parts of the events. Interviews with scientists indicated that they enjoyed Sky Fest because there was very little time involved on their parts outside of the actual event; the activities were created and/or chosen by the E/PO professionals, and setup for the events was completed before they arrived.

            "abstract": "Inference of spatially distributed reservoir and aquifer properties from scattered and spatially limited data poses a poorly constrained nonlinear inverse problem that can have many solutions. In particular, the uncertainty in the geologic continuity model can remarkably degrade the quality of fluid displacement predictions, hence, the efficiency of resource development plans. For model calibration, instead of estimating aquifer properties for each grid cell in the model, the sparse representation of the aquifer properties is estimated from nonlinear production data. The resulting calibration problem can be solved using recent developments in sparse signal processing, widely known as compressed sensing. This novel formulation leads to a sparse data inversion technique that effectively searches for relevant geologic patterns that can explain the available spatiotemporal data.\nWe recently introduced a new model calibration framework by using sparse geologic dictionaries that are constructed from uncertain prior geologic models. Here, we first demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sparse geologic dictionaries for flexible and robust model calibration under prior geologic uncertainty. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in using limited nonlinear production data to identify a consistent geologic scenario from a number of candidate scenarios, which is usually a challenging problem in geostatistical reservoir characterization. We then evaluate the feasibility of adopting this framework for field application. In particular, we present subsurface field model calibration applications in which sparse geologic dictionaries are learned from uncertain prior information on large-scale reservoir property descriptions. We consider two large-scale field case studies, the Brugges and the Norne field examples. We discuss the construction of geologic dictionaries for large-scale problems and present reduced-order methods to speed up the computational aspect of the algorithm for field applications. Our results show that sparse geologic dictionaries offer a promising approach for field-scale data integration applications where the trade-offs between model dimensionality, computation speed, and geologic model plausibility should be reconciled effectively.",

            "abstract": "Boreal and arctic terrestrial ecosystem is a unique ecological region due to large portion of wetland and permafrost distribution. Increasing disturbances, like permafrost-thaw, fire event, climate extreme, would greatly change the patterns and variations of greenhouse gas emission and further affect the feedback between terrestrial ecosystem and climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) accounted for more than 85% of the radioactive forcing (RF) due to long-lived greenhouse gases. However, few studies have considered the full budget of three gases together in this region. In this study, we used a process-based model (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model), driven by multiple global change factors, to quantify the magnitude, spatial and temporal variation of CO2, CH4 and N2O across the boreal and arctic regions. Simulated results have been evaluated against field observations, inventory-based and atmospheric inversion estimates. By implementing a set of factorial simulations, we further quantify the relative contribution of climate, atmospheric composition, fire to the CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes. Continued warming climate potentially could shift the inter-annual and intra-annual variation of greenhouse gases fluxes. The understanding of full budget in this region could provide insights for reasonable future projection, which is also crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "I will present the accumulation of over 10 years of experience teaching STEM subjects to students ranging from 1st grade to graduate school. I was fortunate to gain a lot of valuable teaching experience while in graduate school in Boulder, CO and so many of my experiences center on opportunities for connecting with students in the field in CO.\n3rd-5th grade field hikes – While helping at Jamestown Elementary School, I led hikes with a 3-5th grade class to an abandoned flourospar mine where the students were able to pick up beautiful purple fluorite crystals from the ground while discussing how mining works. During the hike back, we used field meters to measure the pH and conductivity of the stream and discussed the need to balance society’s need for metals with the harmful effects of acid mine drainage.\n9th, 10th grade STEM Academy at Skyline High School – During an NSF-sponsored fellowship, I had the opportunity to teach a STEM class to 9th and 10th graders where we used the engineering design process to a) design a tool to help a handicapped 3rd grader use the drinking fountain by herself and b) design a treatment system for cleaning up acid mine drainage.\nUndergraduate and Graduate Environmental Water Chemistry Field Trip – Students had the opportunity to tour two local mine sites to collect contaminated water that would be used in class for alkalinity titrations and pH, sulfate, and hardness measurements. They also collected water samples upstream and at multiple points downstream of a wastewater treatment plan and measured and graphed the dissolved oxygen “sag” in the river.\nMy main teaching philosophy has two parts: 1) assume the students know nothing and 2) assume the students are even smarter than you think you are. This informs my approach to field trips by always starting from the beginning, but also not oversimplifying the topic. 1st graders on their best day can be very similar to graduate students on their worst.",

            "abstract": "In order to better understand and predict environmental hazards of weather/climate, ecology and deep earth processes, geoscientists develop and use physics-based computational models. These models are used widely both in academic and federal communities. Because of the large effort required to develop and test models, there is widespread interest in component-based modeling, which promotes model reuse and simplified coupling to tackle problems that often cross discipline boundaries. In component-based modeling, the goal is to make relatively small changes to models that make it easy to reuse them as \"plug-and-play\" components. Sophisticated modeling frameworks exist to rapidly couple these components to create new composite models. They allow component models to exchange variables while accommodating different programming languages, computational grids, time-stepping schemes, variable names and units.\nModeling frameworks have arisen in many modeling communities. CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) serves the academic earth surface process dynamics community, while ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) serves many federal Earth system modeling projects. Others exist in both the academic and federal domains and each satisfies design criteria that are determined by the community they serve. While they may use different interface standards or semantic mediation strategies, they share fundamental similarities. The purpose of the Earth System Bridge project is to develop mechanisms for interoperability between modeling frameworks, such as the ability to share a model or service component. This project has three main goals: (1) Develop a Framework Description Language (ES-FDL) that allows modeling frameworks to be described in a standard way so that their differences and similarities can be assessed. (2) Demonstrate that if a model is augmented with a framework-agnostic Basic Model Interface (BMI), then simple, universal adapters can go from BMI to a modeling framework's native component interface. (3) Create semantic mappings between modeling frameworks that support semantic mediation. This third goal involves creating a crosswalk between the CF Standard Names and the CSDMS Standard Names (a set of naming conventions). This talk will summarize progress towards these goals.",

The sensor uses both UV and visible light dispersed by a prism and imaged onto a single CCD to make profile measurements of the Earth limb radiance. The measurement challenges include a wide dynamic range in both spectral and spatial directions and demanding stray light requirements, especially for the UV wavelengths.\nOn NPP, the sensor uses two optical gains (bright and dim limb spectral images) and two integration times (Long and Short) to handle the dynamic range of the limb signal. The sensor also contains precisely-positioned spectral filters at the focal plane to control stray light. The multiple image approach creates noise in retrieved profiles at the bright-dim crossover points. The filters are challenging both in fabrication and in alignment.\nThe proposed operational change for the JPSS2 OMPS Limb sensor eliminates the multiple image approach and reduces stray light levels through use of different images for different wavelength channels. Through use of a stepped integration time scheme and on-board image consolidation, the spectral radiance measurements are improved and more pixels are available for downlink within the allotted data rate. We present the operational concept, results of ground testing using the Limb sensor engineering unit and estimates of expected on-orbit performance.",

            "abstract": "It is well-established that a major pathway for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation is via the partitioning of semi-volatile products of gas-phase photochemical reactions into preexisting organic particulate matter. Semi-volatile partitioning theory is widely used while modeling SOA. Despite its significance, parameterizations based solely on this formation pathway are unable to reproduce trends in SOA mass, particularly high atmospheric O/C ratios and enrichment of organic aerosol aloft. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of formation of SOA through reactions of water-soluble organic gases (WSOG) in atmospheric waters (clouds, fogs, and wet aerosols).\nIn order to understand the relative magnitude of potential precursors to SOA via both formation pathways, we modeled semi-volatile and WSOG concentrations during the Secondary Organic and Aerosol Study (SOAS) conducted in Brent, Alabama during June-July 2013. CMAQ 5.0.1 is used to predict mixing ratios of semi-volatile gases and WSOG over the continental US for a 10 day time period during SOAS. Our modeling results indicate that WSOG concentrations are an order of magnitude greater, on average, than the sum of semi-volatile gases. Interestingly, concentrations of semi-volatile gases increase aloft, unlike concentrations of WSOG. These results suggest that the potential for SOA formation from WSOG was high, and provide support for efforts to accurately model that multiphase chemistry in order to develop more effective air quality management strategies.",

We show how a focused community may come together, share modeling and analysis codes, computing configurations, scientific results, knowledge and expertise on a public cloud platform; diverse groups of researchers working together at “arms length”.\nThrough the OpenNEX experimental workshop, users can view short technical “how-to” videos and explore encapsulated working environment. Workshop participants can easily instantiate Amazon Machine Images (AMI) or launch full cluster and data processing configurations within minutes. Enabling users to instantiate computing environments from configuration templates on large public cloud infrastructures, such as Amazon Web Services, may provide a mechanism for groups to easily use each others work and collaborate indirectly. Moreover, using the public cloud for this workshop allowed a single group to host a large read only data archive, making datasets of interest to the community widely available on the public cloud, enabling other groups to directly connect to the data and reduce the costs of the collaborative work by freeing other individual groups from redundantly retrieving, integrating or financing the storage of the datasets of interest.",

            "abstract": "A relatively new topic of environmental hazards research revolves around vulnerability to disasters. These studies focused separately on biophysical and social vulnerability perspectives. Only recently, community-based vulnerability studies have become common because of the recognition that combining social and biophysical components is important and practical (Cutter, et al., 2000; Cutter, et al., 2003; Turner, et al., 2003). Researchers have modeled vulnerability to analyze its spatial variation (Montz, Cross, and Cutter, 2006). This study aimed at developing a technical framework for community-based vulnerability to the specific hazards of floods. Developing a technical framework in this research used a “vulnerability of place” method (Hebb & Mortsch, 2007). The data reduction technique used was Principal Components Analysis (PCA) which allows for each variable to explain part of the vulnerability. The case study was on flooding in the Tennessee River Basin. The initial run with all 46 variables produced 13 components that explained 69.77% of the variance. Because of the relative homogeneity across the county (i.e., land use and soil types most vulnerable to flooding being located away from heavily populated areas) biophysical variables became less important in this region in creating overall risk scores. This is made all the more obvious by the number of social variables (17) compared to the number of biophysical variables (8) in the final components. The lowest risk block groups are located within the cities: central Florence, central, and central Madison. The highest risk block groups are in rural areas covered predominately with pasture and agricultural land or forests. They also lie near or within the 100 year floodplain.",

            "abstract": "Models for the growth of the Tibetan plateau have been a subject of great debate for decades. Here we add to the debate with new insights from an advanced imaging of the lithosphere structure of the western China. To resolve the ambiguity of model parameters and to improve resolution in seismic imaging, a combination of different data sets that have sensitivities to different parameters is required. We’ve recently developed joint-inversion methods involving Pn travel times, receiver functions, and surface wave dispersion measurements and applied them systematically to seismic stations in western China to obtain improved 3D P and S lithosphere models. Our models show significantly higher Vp/Vs ratios in northern Himalaya Block and southern Qiangtang Block than in the Lhasa Block. Mid-crustal low velocity zone (LVZ) is observed under much of the Tibetan Plateau. However, it is much more pronounced under the outer regions of the plateau (the Himalaya and Qiangtang Blocks) than under its interior (the Lhasa Block). The location of pronounced mid-crustal LVZ correlates (anti-correlates) with the distribution of seismicity in the plateau; the low seismicity areas have more pronounced LVZs and greater Vp/Vs values and the high seismic areas have less pronounced LVZs and smaller Vp/Vs values. The observations support the existence of a proto-Tibetan Plateau core and the outward growth of the margins at a later stage after the India-Eurasian collision (Wang C.S. et al., PNAS, 2008). The proto-plateau is more rigid and can sustain stress to cause brittle failure of earthquakes while the materials at the margins are weaker and can be subject to plastic deformation with much less seismicity. In this model, the proto-plateau core acts as an efficient medium for the stress transfer from the collision front to the margins for the outward growth of the plateau. The crust and mantle lithosphere act as a coherent unit as indicated by the consistent pattern of seismic anomalies with depth. We speculate that such a stress-transfer mechanism from strong lithosphere blocks (e.g., major basins surrounding the plateau such as Tarim, Qaidam, and Sichuan) may have played a strong role in generating the deformation and seismicity in Asia.",

            "abstract": "Significant differences exist between the sedimentology of fluvial and tidal channels. This is primarily the result of differences in the temporal and spatial patterns of the hydrodynamics, and, where the regimes overlap, complex interactions between the two. In this detailed study, we investigate flow and resulting sedimentation in six tidal meander bends with varying levels of fluvial influence. Tidal currents were recorded using a combination of continuous deployments and vessel-based synoptic measurements. Residual circulation patterns and estimates of tidal asymmetry were determined. A series of cores, taken along transects both parallel and perpendicular to the channel, were used to examine the spatial variation of mud and sand deposits.\nWe observed a separation of flow into ebb and flood pathways, creating a residual circulation and encouraging the growth of point bars. At our study sites, the majority of the channels were found to be ebb dominant. At several tidal sites, we identified regions of the channel where the flow remained close to zero throughout much of the tidal cycle. This occurred in sections of the channel that were primarily active during the flood tide. In these areas, settling of fine sediment was not limited to slack water periods as is common to most systems and, instead, could occur over longer periods. This translated to sandier sediments being observed in parts of the channel that were primarily active during the ebb tide, compared to muddier sediments where the channel only was active during flood tides.\nIn regions where there was a greater fluvial influence, flow reversal during flood tides was reduced, and the timing of slack water was altered. At the upstream limit of our observations, minimal flow reversal was observed during the tide and the current slowed to zero (slack) only once per tidal cycle (during the flood). Although water levels at this site indicated that the tidal wave was strongly flood dominated due to shallow water distortion effects (M2:M4 phase difference = 97 degrees), the superposition of fluvial flows led to the true transport being ebb dominated. In addition to differences in the levels of mud and sand deposition, the length of period during which settling of fine sediment occurs may impact vertical accumulation rates in the channel.",

            "abstract": "Delhi, capital of India, is one of the most important polluted urban areas in the world. With a population of about 16 million, and an annual average growth rate of 3.85%, a rapidly increasing number of vehicles (more than 7.4 million, with an annual average growth rate of 7.27%, as reported by the Economic Survey of Delhi, 2012–2013), Delhi is facing an aggressive rise in vehicular pollution. Ground-level traffic vehicles in Delhi are typically natural gas fueled, gasoline fueled or diesel-fueled. The traffic-related air pollutants [particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)] have huge impact on the health of the population given high exposure risk for daily commuters.\nWe conducted on-roadway ambient monitoring on National Highway-2 (NH-2; Delhi–Mathura Road), on the southeast outer zone of Delhi represented by heterogeneous traffic during heavy traffic hours in the morning and early evening, with varying vehicle speeds ranging 35-60 km/h. Ambient levels of PM2.5, PM10, O3, NOx, CO, CO2, black carbon (BC), and certain VOCs (benzene, xylene, ethylbenze) were recorded. In addition, traffic volume count surveys were carried out to record the number of vehicles in different hours of the day, moving across the count point during a given time. Specific traffic volume counts were also conducted at the location to understand the flow of traffic. Vehicle counts classified the vechicles into separate categories: buses (9.1%), trucks (9.2%), cars (41.6%), two-wheelers (30.3%), auto-rickshaws (6%) and other non-motorized traffic (3.9%). Statistical models have been developed to predict on-roadway pollutant concentrations in terms of specific vehicle counts, and weather parameters (temperature, wind speed). Results suggest that two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws significantly impact PM concentrations. Concentrations of BC are a strong function of heavy duty traffic (buses and trucks), two-wheelers and cars. Ozone and CO2 have a strong temperature dependence while NO2 concentrations are a function of both temperature and wind parameters. Wind speed was identified as a key parameter in majority of the prediction models that were developed.",

            "abstract": "From a hydrologic point of view, the critical zone in alpine areas contains the first interaction of living systems with water which will flow to streams and rivers that sustain lowland biomes and human civilization. A key to understanding critical zone functions is understanding the flow of energy, and we can measure temperature as a way of looking at energy transfer between related systems. In this study we installed a Distributed Temperature Sensor (DTS) and fiber-optic cable in a zero-order stream at 9,000 ft in the Medicine Bow National Forest in southern Wyoming. We measured the temperature of the stream for 17 days from June 29 to July 16; the first 12 days were mostly sunny with occasional afternoon storms, and the last 5 experienced powerful, long-lasting storms for much of the day. The DTS measurements show a seasonal warming trend of both minimum and maximum stream temperature for the first 12 days, followed by a distinct cooling trend for the five days that experienced heavy storm activity. To gain insights into the timing and mechanisms of energy flow through the critical zone systems, we analyzed the timing of stream temperature change relative to solar short-wave radiation, and compared the stream temperature temporal response to the temporal response of soil temperature adjacent to the stream. Since convective thunderstorms are a dominant summer weather pattern in sub-alpine regions in the Rocky Mountains, this study gives us further insight into interactions of critical zone processes and weather in mountain ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The Kamchatka peninsula lies along the confluence of the Pacific Ocean, and the Bering and Okhotsk Seas (OS). Its location is ideal to record shifts in regional ocean and atmospheric circulation and contains vast stores of carbon-rich peatlands, yet paleoclimate records from this area are scarce. This research aims to provide new paleo-proxy records that document carbon dynamics, precipitation, and temperature over the Holocene.\nWe focus on site C4 (54.02 N, 156.13 E) located 18 km from OS coast at 91 m elevation and draw comparisons with site C1 (54.91 N, 156.60 E) which is 62 km from the coast at 256 m elevation, both in the Western Lowland (WL) region. Cores C1 and C4 are 450 and 375 cm in length, respectively. C4 and C1 were analyzed for organic matter (OM) content; while C4 received additional δ-deuterium (δD), plant macrofossil, and fossil pollen analysis. Both cores cover the last 13,000 years from the Western Lowlands (WL); prior to this study no such records existed from the WL or the eastern OS coastline. Chronologies are based on radiocarbon dating of fine fraction bulk peat and Sphagnum plant macrofossils.\nAt both sites, peat accumulation began 11 ka (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), is continuous to the surface, interlayered with tephra, and overlays a clay unit with 20% OM. OM density measured at 1 cm intervals show similar means of 0.1 g cm-3 over the last 11 ka and, despite the close proximity of the sites (103 km), they show two opposing OM trends: Period 1) From 5.8 to 3.5 ka, C1 OM density decreased ~0.10 to 0.06 g cm-3 while C4 increased from ~0.10 to 0.19 g cm-3, and Period 2) from 3.5 to 0.9 ka, C1 OM density increased to ~0.18 g cm-3 while C4 decreased to ~0.11 cm-3. Peat carbon accumulation rate (PCAR) is similar for both periods in C1 and C4 at 20.1 and 14.1 g m-2 yr-1, respectively. Prior to 5.8 ka PCAR in C1 and C4 is ~30 g m-2 yr-1 in the early Holocene, decreasing to 19 g m-2 yr-1 in the Mid- Late Holocene. C4 shows large PCAR increase to 50 g m-2 yr-1 from 8-7 ka. Paleoenvironmental syntheses of the WL show Period 1 and Period 2 correspond to cooling and warming phases, respectively, while a wet-temperate phase corresponds with higher PCAR in C4. Disagreement in C4 and C1 might be related to proximity with the OS; reflecting shifts in OS circulation and sea ice cover. Pending results of Sphagnum ðD from C4 might serve as a proxy for the OS.",

Resolving the tempo and mode of the millennial-scale mega-earthquakes is a cardinal challenge of current paleoseimologic reserach. Coseismic turbidites give us an opportunity to reveal recurrence history and suppercyles of such prehistoric great earthquakes.\nWe investigated three piston cores from landward slope basins in the Nankai Trough off Muroto, southwest Japan, in order to detect Holocene paleoearthquake history. Tow of three, Cores KR9705P1 and KR9911PC1 were obtain from the Tosabae Trough, and the other Core KR9911PC2 from an adjacent landward slope basin. Each turbidities layer from those three piston cores were correlated based on the visual core descriptin, CT scan images, magnetic susceptibility, XRF-CS profiles, and grain size analysis.\nMagnetic susceptibility and grain size are sensitive to detect turbidite layers. Also XRF-CS profiles are usefull to detect and characterize those turbidits. Our correlation suggest that average recurrence time interval of turbidites and/or sandy layers was ~150 years and it was almostly equivalent to those of historic earthquakes for last 7 k.y.\nTosabae trough are filling with a total of ~260m thick stratified sediments and sedimentary sequance of this isolated basin has a potential to be a paleoseismometer of the Nankai Great Earthquakes for last the 200-400 kyrs for to understand the tempo and mode of subduction earthquakes under different climatic conditions.",

The Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model has been developed as a tool to identify reasonable emission forecast and mitigation strategies that achieve air quality and greenhouse gas related targets simultaneously at least cost. Recently, Konkuk University and IIASA has been jointly developing the GAINS-Korea Model by reflecting domestic emission activities and environmental conditions. One of the most important challenges for developing GAINS-Korea model is to reproduce CAPSS – the national emissions inventory of Korea- in the GAINS framework. Matching two different databases are not easy because of different sector classification schemes, estimation methods, and etc. In this study, we developed a base year emissions of the GAINS-Korea for the criteria air pollutants using CAPSS. A new set of methodologies to link national inventory to international framework (GAINS) were introduced so that the GAINS-Korea can produce realistic emission outlooks and test control alternatives. We will discuss several underlying issues, such as improvement of accuracy for mapping, conversion, for our base year emission inventory development in site.",

            "abstract": "Scaling in many systems is often represented by a global Hurst exponent from the data. However, many cases show a crossover in scaling thus yielding two sub ranges of time windows with different scaling exponents. The crossover point is an important feature of the system but its computation is often complicated. A scale invariance in the two regimes with asymptotic behavior before and after the crossover suggests a hyperbolic fit for the fluctuation functions. Consequently a hyperbolic regression scheme is used to compute the crossover point (the center of the hyperbola) and the respective Hurst exponents (slopes of asymptotes). In the case of magnetospheric dynamics this method yields a measure of the time scales in the AL data before and after the crossover which are in agreement with previous studies that used power spectral density (PSD) or structure function (SF) to characterize the scaling break/crossover. Furthermore, a comparison of the crossover phenomenon in AL data to those from several theoretical models yields a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Langevin (OUL) model which is then used for robust estimates of the crossover time by calculating its variance using multi-trajectory ensemble approach. The fluctuation analysis of AL data detrended using expected values from OUL model is shown to have no crossovers, unlike detrending by persistence or DFA of AL data, thus providing a new understanding of crossover phenomenon in fluctuation analysis.",

            "abstract": "In-channel structures, i.e. cross-vanes and J-hooks, are commonly installed in river restoration projects to modify the streambed morphology and stream water surface profile, and are known to change hyporhiec exchange flux and habitats for riverine animals. However, few studies have continuous and accurate pre- and post-treatment data to evaluate the impact of these structures on channel hydraulic gradients and morphology. To quantify the effects of in-channel structures, we developed a scaled physical model of a meandering stream with a cross-vane and 6 J-hooks on a mobile-bed river table. Close-range photogrammetry technique was applied to obtain 3-D water and ground surface profiles with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution. The experiment was compared with a control experiment without structures while maintaining the same initial conditions of river bed, floodplain and stream flow. Results indicated that the cross-vane caused an average local head loss that represented 16% of the total stream reach head loss, and a 74% increase in channel load in the entire stream reach. Most J-hooks can create stepwise patterns in stream longitudinal profile, and cross-vane can create even more significant ones. Hydraulic gradients across the intra-meander zone also increased with in-channel structures, i.e. from 2.5% to 3.5% at the meander neck. Scour pools developed downstream of the cross-vane, and mostly around the 4 meander apex J-hooks at their hooked tip. Backwater caused by the cross-vane steepened the local water table profile by an additional 4.2%, and was the primary driver of statistically significant hydraulic gradient increase. Reach scale water and streambed surface profiles from our study provided detailed data to improve the understanding of in-channel structure effects, and may serve as reliable data source in computational modeling of hyporheic exchange.",

All of previous works assumed that high pCO2 has been decreased to a few bars in the first a few hundreds millions of years (e.g., Zhanle et al., 2011). However, this process is not easy because of material and process barriers as shown below. Four barriers are present. First, the ultra-acidic pH (<0.1) of 4.4Ga ocean prevented the precipitation of carbonates at mid-oceanic ridge through water-rock interaction after the birth of primordial ocean driven by plate tectonics or pseudo-plate tectonics system. To overcome this barrier, primordial (anorthosite + KREEP) continents must have been above sea-level to increase pH rapidly through hydrological process. Second, major cap rocks on the Hadean oceanic crust must have been komatiite with minor basaltic rocks to precipitate carbonates through water-rock interaction and transport them into mantle through subduction at higher than the intermediate P/T geotherm on the Benioff plane. If not, carbonate minerals are all decarbonated at shallower depths than the Moho plane. Komatiite production depends on mantle potential temperature which must have been rapidly decreased to yield only Fe-enriched MORB by 3.8Ga.\n Third, the primordial continents composed of anorthosite with subordinate amounts of KREEP basalts must have been annihilated by 4.0Ga to alter pH to be possible to precipitate carbonates by hydrothermal process. The value of pCO2 must have been decreased down to a few bars from c.a. 50 bars at TSI (total surface irradiance) = 75% under the restricted time limit. If failed, the Earth must have been Venus state which is impossible to bear life on the planet.\n Fourth is the role of tectonic erosion to destroy and transport the primordial continent of anorthosite into deep mantle by subduction. Anorthosite + KREEP was the mother’s milk grow life on the Earth, but disappeared by 4.0Ga or even earlier, but alternatively granites were formed and accumulated on the Earth to supply nutrients for life. This is time-dependent process to increase new continents.\n Fifth is the water content of 3-5km thick, if the value was over, no way to bear life nor evolution afterwards.\n After all, the Hadean Earth has passed the really risky tightrope processes to bear life. If any of above five conditions was lost, life has not been appeared.",

            "abstract": "In order to truly broaden the impact of our scientific community, effective communication should be taught alongside research skills to developing scientists. In the summer of 2014, we incorporated an informal communications course into the 10th year of UNAVCO’s Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students (RESESS), a year-long internship program centered around an 11-week intensive summer research experience. The goals of the newly designed course included giving students the tools they need to make a broader impact with their science, starting now; improving the students’ confidence in public speaking and using social media for outreach; and giving students the tools they need to apply for jobs or graduate school. Specifically, the course included teaching of professional communication skills, such as e-mail and phone etiquette, resume and CV tailoring, and interview techniques, and public communications skills, such as crafting and simplifying messages, visual communication for the public, and public speaking. Student interns were encouraged to step back from the details of their research projects to put their work into a big-picture context relevant to the public and to policy makers.\nThe course benefited from input and/or participation from UNAVCO Education and Community Engagement staff, engineering and managerial staff, and graduate student interns outside the RESESS program, and University of Colorado research and communications mentors already involved in RESESS.\nAs the summer program is already packed with research and skill development, one major challenge was fitting in teaching these communications skills amongst many other obligations: a GRE course, a peer-focused scientific communications course, a computing course, and, of course, research. Can we do it all? This presentation will provide an overview of the course planning, articulation of course goals, and execution challenges and successes. We will present our lessons learned from summer 2014 as well as feedback from both student interns and UNAVCO staff who helped support the course.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of lava flow after its emplacement provides volume and constraints for lava flow emplacement simulations that help assess pending volcanic hazards. Additionally, it gives us better insights in understanding the dynamics of the underlying magmatic plumbing system and the possible mechanism of the eruption. In this work, we developed a technique using monostatic Cosmo-SkyMed and bistatic TanDEM-X data to calculate the volume, measure the thickness, and the horizontal and vertical displacements immediately after the emplacement of the October 2010 lava flow at Piton de la Fournaise. Results show that the thickest part of the October 2010 lava flow is about 13 to 16 m and the DRE volume is estimated to fall within the range of 1.71 to 3.00 x 106 m3 (±1σ), depending on which InSAR database was used. We also observe that the October 2010 lava flow is subsiding at a maximum rate of 14 cm yr-1. Apart from the vertical displacement, joint sliding and centripetal displacement were also identified with a maximum rate of 4.0 cm yr-1.\nWe cross-validated our InSAR results with the mixed-pixel technique of Harris [1997] in terms of the estimated volumes. Our analysis shows that the volume derived using a few TanDEM-X interferograms fitted well within the range of volume given by the mixed-pixel technique as compared to the huge monostatic Cosmo-SkyMed database.\nIn addition to the October 2010 lava flow, we also characterized the thin lava flow deposit of the December 2010 eruption, however using only bistatic TanDEM-X data. In this case of thin lava deposits, we expect that TanDEM-X are best to use in deriving the thickness and estimating the volume as these type of data are more sensitive to topographic change.\n",

            "abstract": "The plate tectonics has offered a currently accepted link between the horizontal movement of lithospheric plates, closure of intervening oceanic basin and formation of oceanic suture zone preserved in continental collision zones. The Paleozoic Bohemian Massif is a classical collisional orogen evolving through Andean type convergence and for which a modified view on the internal architecture of collisional orogens was recently proposed. The characteristic feature of the new model is the convergence of two contrasting lithospheric domains related to subduction of an attenuated felsic metaigneous crust under thehigh density metabasite dominated rifted (Gondwana) margin. The relamination of refractory light material rich in radioactive elements underneath the relatively dense upper plate is responsible for the gravitational instabilities that lead to the overturns in the thickened crust. Such a process results in the formation of a diffuse cryptic suture zone, i.e., a wide zone in which materials from the lower and upper plates are mixed to form a hybrid continental crust. The diffuse cryptic suture zone remains the only evidence of the original plate boundary repeatedly re-appearing within the orogen.",

Many a times, especially in developing countries, the approaches deviate from this basic paradigm and results in ineffective management of the natural resources. This becomes more relevant in these countries which are witnessing heavy exodus of the rural population to urban areas increasing the pressures on the basic commodities. Spatial technologies which provide the opportunity to enhance the knowledge visualization of the policy makers and administrators which facilitates technical and scientific management of the resources. Increasing population has created negative impacts on the per capita availability of several resources, which has been well accepted in the statistical records of several developing countries. For instance, the per capita availability of water in India has decreased substantially in last decade and groundwater depletion is on the rise. There is hence a need of tool which helps in restoring the resource through visualization and evaluation temporally.\nGeological parameters play an important role in operation of several natural systems and earth sciences parameters may not be ignored. Spatial technologies enables application of 2D as well as 3D modeling taking into account variety of natural parameters related to diverse areas.\nThe paper presents case studies where spatial technology has helped in not only understanding the natural systems but also providing solutions, especially in Indian context.

            "abstract": "As marine research becomes increasingly multidisciplinary in its approach there has been a corresponding rise in the demand for large quantities of high quality interoperable data. A number of regional initiatives are already addressing this requirement through the establishment of e-infrastructures to improve the discovery and access of marine data. Projects such as Geo-Seas and SeaDataNet in Europe, Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) in the USA and IMOS in Australia have implemented local infrastructures to facilitate the exchange of standardised marine datasets. However, each of these regional initiatives has been developed to address their own requirements and independently of other regions. To establish a common framework for marine data management on a global scale these is a need to develop interoperability solutions that can be implemented across these initiatives.\nThrough a series of workshops attended by the relevant domain specialists, the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) project has identified areas of commonality between the regional infrastructures and used these as the foundation for the development of three prototype interoperability solutions addressing:\nthe use of brokering services for the purposes of providing access to the data available in the regional data discovery and access services including via the GEOSS portal\nthe development of interoperability between cruise summary reporting systems in Europe, the USA and Australia for routine harvesting of cruise data for delivery via the Partnership for Observation of Global Oceans (POGO) portal\nthe establishment of a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) for selected sensors installed on vessels and in real-time monitoring systems using sensor web enablement (SWE)\nThese prototypes will be used to underpin the development of a common global approach to the management of marine data which can be promoted to the wider marine research community. ODIP is a community lead project that is currently focussed on regional initiatives in Europe, the USA and Australia but which is seeking to expand this framework to include other regional marine data infrastructures.",

Basic information on alpine plant distribution by elevation and substrate provides a basis for anticipating which species may decline in a warming climate. The Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) is a worldwide effort to document vegetation changes over time in alpine settings using permanent multi-summit plots. The California/Nevada group currently monitors seven permanent GLORIA target regions, composed of 29 summits in alpine and subalpine zones. Summits range in elevations from 2918m to 4325m on substrates including dolomite, granite, quartzite, and volcanics. High-resolution plant occurrence and cover data from the upper 10 meters of each summit are presented. Plants from our target regions can be divided into three groups: summit specialists found only on the highest peaks, alpine species found predominantly within the alpine zone, and broadly distributed species found in the alpine zone and below. Rock substrate and microsite soil development have a strong influence on plant communities and species richness. We present the first set of five-year resurvey and temperature data from 18 summits. We have documented some annual variation in species presence/absence at almost all sites, but no dramatic changes in total diversity. Consistent with the expectation of rising global temperatures, our soil temperature loggers have documented temperature increases at most of our sites. These data are a baseline for assessing bioclimatic shifts and future plant composition in California and Nevada’s alpine zone.",

This complements flume and field studies, stability analyses and parameter sensitivity studies using a batch of numerical simulations. With the presented approach researchers can -- similar to flume and field studies -- inspect and interact with the morphological evolution in real-time. Due to the numerical basis, the user can benefit from a number of additional features that aren't possible in physical studies, such as the ability to pause (and in the future rewind) the dynamics, and to look in detail at the numerics of the individual processes that cause the simulated behaviour while the system evolves.\nWe will demonstrate this interactive modelling approach based on the new Delft3D Flexible Mesh solver and a number of validation cases, and sketch our vision for applying this technique to larger more integrated models of rivers, estuaries and coastal regions.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) entails spatially and temporally evolving permeability fields. During non-isothermal fluid injection, thermo-elastic stress and fluid pressure changes act upon partially open or hydrothermally altered fracture sets to enhance formation permeability. The physical couplings that drive this behavior are non-linearly dependent upon one another to varying degrees. To explore these interactions we are developing a thermo-hydromechanical (THM) simulator capable of coupling the dominant physics of shear stimulation and allowing flexibility in the use of monolithic or staggered numerical schemes. Permeability is allowed to evolve under several constitutive models tailored to both porous media and fractures, considering the influence of thermo-hydromechanical stress, creep, and elasto-plastic shear and dilation in a ubiquitously fractured medium. From this basis we explore the coupled physical processes that control the evolution of permeability during shear stimulation and long-term evolution of a geothermal reservoir. Previous attempts to model the stimulation and sustainability of EGS are discussed in their relation to the current work and in an attempt to elucidate the dominant mechanisms of permeability alteration, including order-of-magnitude differences in permeability gain during hydraulic stimulation in isothermal versus non-isothermal simulations.",

            "abstract": "The Bengal Delta region in South Asia is well-known for its endemicity to diarrheal diseases and high population vulnerability to natural calamities and diarrheal and other water-related disease epidemics. The diarrheal disease outbreaks in the coastal and inland floodplains, such as cholera, rotavirus, and dysentery, show distinct seasonal peaks and spatial signatures in their origin and progression. The last three decades of surveillance data also shows a drastic increase of diarrheal incidence in both urban and peri-urban areas, even after correcting for population trends. Recent research has shown increased roles of hydroclimatic events such as droughts and floods on the seasonal to interannual characteristics, as well as the coastal and inland progression patterns of disease outbreaks. However, the mechanisms behind these phenomena, especially how the changes in the regional climatic and hydrologic processes contributed to the spatio-temporal trends of disease outbreaks are not fully understood.\nHere, we analyze the last 30-years of diarrheal incidence in Dhaka and regional surveillance centers with changes in climatic or anthropogenic forcings: regional hydrology, flooding, water usage, population growth and density in urban settlements, as well as shifting climate patterns and frequency of natural disasters. We use a set of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) model projections of regional precipitation and temperature patterns in Bengal Delta to develop scenarios of diarrheal disease projections with spatial (coastal and inland) and temporal (dry vs wet) comparisons. Our preliminary results shows that growing water scarcity in the dry season, increasing salinity in coastal areas, and lack of sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure for urban settlements have increased endemicity of cholera outbreaks in spring, while record flood events, limited stormwater drainage and sanitation, and more intensive monsoon has contributed to increased epidemic outbreaks. However, a number of future projections suggest that spring will be drier and fall will be wetter in upcoming years especially in the southwestern parts of the Bengal delta, which eventually will make the inhabitants more vulnerable to diarrheal outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "The GRACE mission uses two spacecraft in near identical Earth orbits with a phase sensitive microwave ranging instrument that measures changes in spacecraft separation. High precision measurements of the spacecraft separation yield monthly Earth gravity field measurements. The GRACE FO mission adds the Laser Ranging Instrument (LRI) to demonstrate high resolution spacecraft separation measurements with phase-sensitive detection of a frequency-stabilized laser transponder. Previous studies show the improvements in mass change detection afforded by the higher sensitivity range change measurements.\nThe sparse spatial/temporal sampling and single gravity field component detection of a polar orbiting satellite pair leads to aliasing and artifacts in the gravity field data. These effects limit the mass change detection capability of a GRACE-like mission. Adding a second pair of satellites improves overall system performance by filling in data gaps and sampling the gravity field in different directions. The added expense of a second satellite pair has made this option for improved performance untenable.\nA SmallSat GRACE-like mission addresses the cost concern for a multi-pair mission by reducing spacecraft expense and making common launch possible. Through use of a laser ranging sensor and other low-power subsystems and use of existing smallsat architectures, a complete spacecraft-instrument system is shown to meet measurement requirements and make the overall system expense comparable to existing single-pair missions. The resulting multi-pair space segment approach offers a viable option for a GRACE-like mission while improving the science through its better sampling of the gravity field. We show the system concept and simulated gravity field retrievals based on estimates of instrument and spacecraft performance.",

            "abstract": "The projected impacts of climate change in the coastal zone will require local planning and local resources to adapt to increasing risks of social, environmental, and economic consequences from extreme events. This means that, for the first time in human history, aggregated local demands could outpace global supply of certain “climate-critical resources.” For example, construction materials such as sand and gravel, steel, and cement may be needed to fortify many coastal locations at roughly the same point in time if decision makers begin to construct new storm barriers or elevate coastal lands. Where might adaptation bottlenecks occur? Can the world produce enough cement to armour the world’s seaports as flood risks increase due to sea-level rise and more intense storms? Just how many coastal engineers would multiple such projects require? Understanding such global implications of adaptation requires global datasets—such as bathymetry, coastal topography, local sea-level rise and storm surge projections, and construction resource production capacity—that are currently unavailable at a resolution appropriate for a global-scale analysis. Our research group has identified numerous gaps in available data necessary to make such estimates on both the supply and demand sides of this equation. This presentation examines the emerging need and current availability of these types of datasets and argues for new coordinated efforts to develop and share such data.",

            "abstract": "The height of the tropopause, which divided the stratosphere and the troposphere, is a result of two rival categories of processes: the tropospheric vertical convection and the radiative heating of the stratosphere resulting from the ozone cycle. Hence, it is natural that tropospheric and stratospheric phenomena can have effect each other in manifold processes of stratosphere-troposphere interactions. In the present study we focus our attention to the \"top-down\" side of the interaction: the impact of stratospheric ozone distribution on the features of tropospheric circulation and the associated weather patterns and regional climate conditions.\nWe proceed from analyzes of the observational data performed at the A.I. Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory, which suggest a distinct correlation between stratospheric ozone distribution, synoptic formations and air-masses boundaries in the upper troposphere and the temperature field of the lower stratosphere [1]. Furthermore, we analyze local features of atmospheric general circulation and stratospheric ozone distribution from the atmospheric reanalyses and general circulation model data, focusing our attention to instantaneous positions of subtropical and polar stationary atmospheric fronts, which define regional characteristics of the general circulation cells in the troposphere and separate global tropospheric air-masses, correspond to distinct meteorological regimes in the TOC field [2, 3].\nWe assume that by altering the tropopause height, stratospheric ozone-related processes can have an impact on the location of the stationary atmospheric fronts, thereby exerting influence on circulation processes in troposphere and lower stratosphere. For midlatitudes, the tropopause height controls the position of the polar stationary front, which has a direct impact on the trajectory of motion of active vortices on synoptic tropospheric levels, thereby controlling weather patterns in that region and the regional climate. This mechanism is particularly important for the formation of blocking events.\n[1] A.M.

As a result of the ice cover and an uncoupled day/night cycle, the physical and biogeochemical processes in the lakes are highly unusual, with biogeochemical gradients and concentrations of specific compounds often exceeding those found in other aquatic ecosystems on Earth. These lakes are ideal systems for the study of redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes, model systems for understanding the effects of global climate change on polar ecosystems, end-member systems that provide insight into biogeochemical and limnological dynamics in meromictic lakes, analogues for life on other planets, and perfect systems to study microbial life at its thermodynamic limits. Lake Vanda, in the Wright valley, is relatively deep (73 m), hypersaline and has anoxic bottom water. High concentrations of chacotrophic salts results in low water activities that exert further challenges on microbial life. We collected details geochemical profiles of nutrients, major ions, dissolved gases, and redox metabolites and measured rates of microbially-mediated processes that cycle carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in the lakes waters and sediments. Despite the harsh and extreme nature of Lake Vanda and the thermodynamic barriers to microbially-mediated geochemical reactions, microorganisms are not only present in the lake but they mediate a diverse suite of geochemical processes. Statistical correlations between geochemical parameters, microbial activity and microbial community composition shed light on the factors that regulate and limit microbial activity in this unique extreme environment.",

            "abstract": "Caves are often considered buffered environments in terms of their ability to sustain near constant microclimatic conditions. However, environments within cave entrances are expected to respond most quickly to changing surface conditions. We cataloged a relict assemblage of at least 10 endemic arthropods likely restricted to caves and occurring primarily within cave entranceways. Of these animals, eight were considered new undescribed species. These endemic arthropods have persisted in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) caves despite a catastrophic ecological shift induced by island-wide deforestation, fire intolerance, and drought, as well as intensive livestock grazing and surface ecosystems dominated by invasive species. We consider these animals to be “disturbance relicts” – species whose distributions are now limited to areas that experienced minimal human disturbance historically. Today, these species represent one-third of the Rapa Nui’s known endemic arthropods. Given the island’s severely depauperate native fauna, these arthropods should be considered among the highest priority targets for biological conservation. In other regions globally, epigean examples of imperiled disturbance relicts persisting within narrow distributional ranges have been documented. As human activity intensifies, and habitat loss and fragmentation continues worldwide, additional disturbance relicts will be identified. We expect extinction debts, global climate change and interactions with invasive species will challenge the persistence of both hypogean and epigean disturbance relict species.",

The model captures the well-known increase in charge state ratios C+6/ C+5 and O+7/O+6 in the slow wind, inline with Ulysses observations. We present a theoretical picture explaining the formation of these increases, which are related to regions of higher electron density and temperature near the boundaries of coronal holes. We verify the existence of these regions using a 3D tomographic reconstruction of the lower corona. This work establishes that a steady slow wind flowing along open magnetic field lines can carry high charge states without invoking reconnection with closed field regions. This subset of slow wind can play a role explaining the properties of the non-steady slow wind, and complement dynamic models of slow solar wind formation.",

            "abstract": "Active tectonics of a deformation front constrains the kinematic evolution and structural interaction between the fold-thrust belt and most-recently accreted foreland basin. In Kashmir, the Himalayan Frontal thrust (HFT) is blind, characterized by a broad fold, the Suruin-Mastargh anticline (SMA), and displays no emergent faults cutting either limb. A lack of knowledge of the rate of shortening and structural framework of the SMA hampers quantifying the earthquake potential for the deformation front. Our study utilized the geomorphic expression of dated deformed terraces on the Ujh River in Kashmir. Six terraces are recognized, and three yield OSL ages of 53 ka, 33 ka, and 0.4 ka. Vector fold restoration of long terrace profiles indicates a deformation pattern characterized by regional uplift across the anticlinal axis and back-limb, and by fold limb rotation on the forelimb. Differential uplift across the fold trace suggests localized deformation. Dip data and stratigraphic thicknesses suggest that a duplex structure is emplaced at depth along the basal décollement, folding the overlying roof thrust and Siwalik-Muree strata into a detachment-like fold. Localized faulting at the fold axis explains the asymmetrical fold geometry. Folding of the oldest dated terrace, suggest that rock uplift rates across the SMA range between 2.0-1.8 mm/yr. Assuming a 25° dipping ramp for the blind structure on the basis of dip data constraints, the shortening rate across the SMA ranges between 4.4-3.8 mm/yr since ~53 ka. Of that rate, ~1 mm/yr is likely absorbed by minor faulting in the near field of the fold axis. Given that Himalaya-India convergence is ~18.8-11 mm/yr, internal faults north of the deformation front, such as the Riasi thrust absorbs more of the Himalayan shortening than does the HFT in Kashmir. We attribute a non-emergent thrust at the deformation front to reflect deformation controlled by pre-existing basin architecture in Kashmir, in which the thick succession of foreland strata Murree-Siwalik (8-9 km) overlie a deepened basal décollement. Blind thrusting reflects some combination of layer-parallel shortening, high stratigraphic overburden, relative youth of the HFT, and/or sustained low shortening rate on 10^5 yrs to longer timescales.",

            "abstract": "We use 2D tomography of P- and S-wave velocities (Vp, Vs), based on seismic refraction and surface wave analyses, to characterize subsurface architecture and erodibility of hillslopes. Calibrating the seismic imagery with direct field observations allows us to quantify mechanical properties, image depth-dependent variations in weathering intensity, and identify the mobile-immobile regolith transition and differences in transport efficiency of mobile layers.\nWe conducted a cross-CZO comparison of N- and S-facing slopes at Boulder Creek and Shale Hills CZOs (BcCZO and SSHCZO) to investigate how near-surface weathering and hillslope morphology are influenced by differences in regional geology and climatic as well as local variations in aspect-controlled microclimate. Niwot Ridge (BcCZO) is a high alpine site with minimal soil/veg cover, characterized by steeper S-facing hillslopes; whereas, SSHCZO is a temperate, densely-forested, soil-mantled site with steeper N-facing slopes.\nOn Niwot Ridge, the depth of the weathering front and thickness of mobile regolith are substantially greater on shallower N-facing slopes; however, velocity-based estimates of transport efficiency are higher on S-facing slopes. Although, thin mobile regolith on S-facing slopes may be weaker (slower V), the lower gradient of N-facing slopes and southward asymmetry of the ridge divide, suggests greater transport efficiency on N-facing aspects. This can be explained by the dominance of frost/freeze process on N-facing slopes, which can efficiently develop and transport the thick mobile regolith.\nAt SSHCZO, depths of weathering fronts are invariant with slope aspect, suggesting that aspect control is not a predominant mechanism driving regolith production. Mobile regolith thickness, however, is more than 2-fold greater on N-facing slopes. Additionally, mobile regolith on both slope aspects is primarily composed of well-developed soils. N-facing soils are thicker with greater cohesion, moisture, and inclusion of rock fragments. This is consistent with velocity-based estimates of lower transport efficiency on N-facing slopes relative to the thin, dry, fine grained soils on S-facing slopes.",

            "abstract": "In the framework of the EURO-CORDEX initiative an ensemble of European-wide high resolution regional climate simulations on a 0.11° (~12.5 km) grid has been generated. This study investigates whether the high resolution regional climate models are able to add value to the simulated mean and extreme daily and sub-daily precipitation compared to their coarser resolution 0.44° (~50 km) counterparts. Therefore, pairs of low and high resolution simulations of 8 reanalysis driven models are compared to high resolution gridded observations in the Alps, Germany, Sweden, Norway, France, the Carpathians, and Spain. There is clear evidence that the 0.11° simulations are able to improve the representation of both mean and extreme precipitation in all regions and seasons, even on the spatial scale of the low resolution simulations (50 km grid). The 0.11° simulations are able to reduce biases in large areas of the investigated regions, have an improved representation of spatial precipitation patterns, and precipitation distributions are improved for daily and in particular for 3 hourly precipitation sums. When the evaluation is conducted on the high resolution (12.5 km) grid, the added value of the 0.11° models becomes even more obvious. The primary reason for these improvements seems to be better resolved orography, since most added value is found in and around mountainous regions.",

            "abstract": "Extreme space weather events can adversely impact the operations of critical modern-day technological infrastructure such as high-voltage electric power transmission grids. Understanding of coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere dynamics under extreme solar wind driving conditions is still a major challenge mainly because of a lack of data during such time intervals. This presentation will highlight some of the past and on-going investigations on extreme space weather events, and how these investigations are used to address societal needs. Particularly, I will describe how first principles physics-based 3-D global MHD models are playing a major role in advancing our knowledge on extreme geomagnetically induced currents. These MHD models represent a very important component of attempts to understand the response of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system to varying solar wind conditions.",

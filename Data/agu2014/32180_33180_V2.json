            "abstract": "The Napa earthquake recently occurred close to Silicon Valley. This makes it a good candidate to study what social networks, wearable objects and website traffic analysis (flashsourcing) can tell us about the way eyewitnesses react to ground shaking.\nIn the first part, we compare the ratio of people publishing tweets and with the ratio of people visiting EMSC (European Mediterranean Seismological Centre) real time information website in the first minutes following the earthquake occurrence to the results published by Jawbone, which show that the proportion of people waking up depends (naturally) on the epicentral distance. The key question to evaluate is whether the proportions of inhabitants tweeting or visiting the EMSC website are similar to the proportion of people waking up as shown by the Jawbone data. If so, this supports the premise that all methods provide a reliable image of the relative ratio of people waking up.\nThe second part of the study focuses on the reaction time for both Twitter and EMSC website access. We show, similarly to what was demonstrated for the Mineral, Virginia, earthquake (Bossu et al., 2014), that hit times on the EMSC website follow the propagation of the P waves and that 2 minutes of website traffic is sufficient to determine the epicentral location of an earthquake on the other side of the Atlantic. We also compare with the publication time of messages on Twitter. Finally, we check whether the number of tweets and the number of visitors relative to the number of inhabitants is correlated to the local level of shaking.\nTogether these results will tell us whether the reaction of eyewitnesses to ground shaking as observed through Twitter and the EMSC website analysis is tool specific (i.e. specific to Twitter or EMSC website) or whether they do reflect people’s actual reactions.",

            "abstract": "Rapid assessment of medium to large events with finite source models at regional scales has traditionally been delayed by limitations in seismic-only monitoring systems. Broadband and short period sensors saturate and strong motion sensors are affected by baseline offsets. In practice, this means that strong motion data must be high pass filtered. This approximation breaks down as the earthquakes get larger since the long period band of the spectrum best characterizes these events. In contrast geodetic data record long period motions down to the coseismic offset. They are however less sensitive, with single-epoch noise levels of the order of 1cm. With data from 34 collocated GPS/strong motion stations around the South Napa earthquake, we demonstrate a seismogeodetic algorithm that produces broadband strong motion velocity and displacements. We further show that these data can be ingested into source modeling algorithms with minimal operator interaction. Through retrospective analysis off the South Napa data, we show that one can produce a full suite of models from rapid moment tensors to kinematic slip inversions. While displacement amplitudes are small, often below GPS noise levels, the seismogeodetic solution provides an objective constraint on the accelerometer integration. The rapid inversion to find shallow slip can provide an indication of surface rupture and indicate that enhanced response is likely for road repairs and such. We quantify the improvements and advantages to using 5Hz GPS over 1Hz data.There are over 600 real-time monitoring GPS stations in the western US maintained by several operators; the NASA-sponsored READI project aims to unify these into a network of networks for prototyping earthquake and tsunami warning systems. We argue that the results shown here demonstrate the need for full integration of geodetic networks into seismic monitoring systems and that with current deployed stations this is within reach. However, only a small number of seismic and GPS stations are collocated in the western US In abstracts by Haase et al. and Goldberg et al. we show that low-cost MEMS accelerometers can be used to upgrade existing real-time GPS stations to seismogeodetic capability; 17 stations in southern California have already been upgraded and similar upgrades in the Bay area are forthcoming.",

These tools have been developed from fundamental research as part of a broad collaboration -- facilitated in no small party by the California Earthquake Clearinghouse, between researchers, policy makers, and executive decision makers and practiced and honed during numerous disaster response exercises over the past several years. On 24 August 2014, and the weeks following the m=6 Napa event, it became evident that these technologies will play an important role in the response to natural (and other) disasters in the 21st century.\nGiven the continued rapid growth of computational capabilities, remote sensing technologies, and data gathering capacities -- including by unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is reasonable to expect that both the volume and variety of data available during a response scenario will grow significantly in the decades to come. Inevitably, modern Data Science will be critical to effective disaster response in the 21st century. In this work, we discuss the roles that earthquake simulators, statistical seismicity models, and remote sensing technologies played in the the 2014 Napa earthquake response. We further discuss “Big Data” technologies and data models that facilitate the transformation of raw data into disseminable information and actionable products, and we outline a framework for the next generation of disaster response data infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "The aftershock sequence of the South Napa earthquake is notable both for its low productivity and for its geometric complexity. The aftershocks do not clearly define a fault plane consistent with the NNW-striking vertical plane implied by the mainshock moment tensor and the mapped surface rupture, but instead seem to delineate multiple secondary structures at depth. We investigate this unusual sequence by identifying additional aftershocks that do not appear in the network catalog, relocating the combined aftershock catalog using waveform cross-correlation arrival times and double-difference techniques, and determining focal mechanisms for individual events and event clusters. Additional aftershocks are detected by applying a matched filter approach to the continuous seismic data at nearby stations, with the catalog earthquakes serving as the waveform templates. In tandem with new event detections, we measure precise differential arrival times between events, which we then use in double-difference event location. We detect about 4 times as many well-located aftershocks as in the network catalog. We relocate the events using double-difference in both a 1D and a 3D velocity model. Most of the aftershocks occur between 8 and 11 km depth, similar depth to the mainshock hypocenter and deeper than most of the slip imaged seismically and geodetically. The aftershocks form a diffuse NNW-trending structure, primarily to the north of the mainshock hypocenter and on the west side of the main surface rupture. Within this diffuse trend there are clusters of aftershocks, some suggesting a N-S strike, and some that appear to dip to the east or west. Preliminary single-event and composite focal mechanisms also imply N-S striking strike-slip structures. The mainshock hypocenter and many of the aftershocks occur near the intersection of a sharply defined NE-dipping seismicity structure and the probable location of the West Napa fault, suggesting that stress is concentrated at a fault junction at depth. While the mainshock occurred on the West Napa fault, the majority of the aftershocks occur on other structures in a complex deformation zone.",

            "abstract": "Recently, progress has been made to demonstrate feasibility and benefits of including real-time GPS (rtGPS) in earthquake early warning and rapid response systems. While most concepts have yet to be integrated into operational environments, the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory is currently running an rtGPS based finite fault inversion scheme in true real-time, which is triggered by the seismic-based ShakeAlert system and then sends updated earthquake alerts to a test receiver. The Geodetic Alarm System (G-larmS) was online and responded to the 2014 Mw6.0 South Napa earthquake in California. We review G-larmS’ performance during this event and for 13 aftershocks, and we present rtGPS observations and real-time modeling results for the main shock. The first distributed slip model and a magnitude estimate of Mw5.5 were available 24 s after the event origin time, which could be reduced to 14 s after a bug fix (~8 s S-wave travel time, ~6 s data latency). The system continued to re-estimate the magnitude once every second: it increased to Mw5.9 3 s after the first alert and stabilized at Mw5.8 after 15 s. G-larmS' solutions for the subsequent small magnitude aftershocks demonstrate that Mw~6.0 is the current limit for alert updates to contribute back to the seismic-based early warning system.",

            "abstract": "We explore how stress imparted from the 2014 Napa earthquake influences regional seismicity and thus hazard on the densely populated Bay Area faults nearby. We first calculate Coulomb stress change in the surrounding crust and on adjacent faults as identified by UCERF3 (Field et al., 2013) using the finite fault source model of Barnhart et al. (2014, v2). We then examine the seismic response to the stress transfer by comparing seismicity during the month after 24 August 2014 to the preceding 1.5 yr, for which seismic detection has been stable. There is a seismicity rate increase north of the mainshock, and a modest increase south of the mainshock, both sites roughly along the West Napa fault, where the stress is calculated to have increased by ~0.5 bar. A cluster of earthquakes was triggered at the center of the southern Concord-Green Valley (GV) fault where the stress is calculated to have increased by ~0.2 bar. The post-Napa seismic cluster on the Green Valley fault locates on the N-S (180°) striking trace rather than general trend of 160°, so perhaps by a combination of by its locally more favorable strike and its presumed low friction, since it is a creeping fault. The relationship between the Napa source and the triggered aftershock cluster on the GV fault is analogous to the Landers source, which immediately triggered concentrated seismicity on part of the Hector Mine fault. Like at Napa, Coulomb stress imparted from Landers along most of the Hector Mine rupture zone was negative except near the cluster. Paleoseismic evidence for the GV fault yields a ~200-yr recurrence interval and ~400-yr elapsed time since the last large earthquake, in which case it might be close to rupture (Lienkaemper et al., 2014). We thus suggest that the hazard on the Concord-Green Valley fault has likely increased, and so should be closely monitored for seismicity, strain, and creep.",

            "abstract": "The August 24, 2014 M 6.0 South Napa Earthquake was the largest earthquake to occur in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to more than 7 million people, in almost 25 years. The event occurred within an area of dense GPS instrumentation including continuous stations from the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, Bay Area Regional Deformation Network and other networks. Coseismic displacements of up to 3 cm were rapidly estimated within one day after the event, providing a map of Earth shape change at over one hundred stations around the epicenter.\nThe earthquake thus presets as an excellent “teachable moment” to introduce students to basic geoscience concepts, modern geophysical methods, and the state of knowledge in earthquake science. We have developed an example exercise that uses GPS-derived interseismic velocities and coseismic offsets to explore deformation in the vicinity of the earthquake rupture. This exercise builds on the UNAVCO education resource “Infinitesimal Strain Analysis Using GPS Data” (http://www.unavco.org/education/resources/educational-resources/lesson/majors-gps-strain/majors-gps-strain.html), a module designed to introduce undergraduate geoscience majors to concepts of crustal deformation using GPS velocity data. In the module students build their intuition about infinitesimal strain through manipulation of physical models, apply this intuition to interpret maps of GPS velocity vectors, and ultimately calculate the instantaneous deformation rate of triangles on the Earth’s surface defined by three GPS sites.\nThe South Napa data sets provide an example with clear societal relevance that can be used to explore the basic concepts of deformation, but may also be extended to explore topics such as strain accumulation, release, and transfer associated with the earthquake cycle. The UNAVCO module could be similarly extended to create additional exercises in response to future events with clear geodetic signals.",

The M 6.0 South Napa earthquake occurred on 24 August 2014. The area was flown 29 May 2014 preceeding the earthquake, and again on 29 August 2014, five days after the earthquake. The UAVSAR results show slip on a single fault at the south end of the rupture near the epicenter of the event. The rupture branches out into multiple faults further north near the Napa area. A combined inversion of rapid GPS results and the unwrapped UAVSAR interferogram indicate nearly pure strike slip motion. Using this assumption, the UAVSAR data show horizontal right-lateral slip across the fault of 19 cm at the south end of the rupture and increasing to 70 cm northward over a distance of 6.5 km. The joint inversion indicates slip of ~30 cm on a network of sub-parallel faults is concentrated in a zone about 17 km long. The lower depths of the faults are 5-8.5 km. The eastern two sub-parallel faults break the surface, while three faults to the west are buried at depths ranging from 2-6 km with deeper depths to the north and west. The geodetic moment release is equivalent to a M 6.1 event. Additional ruptures are observed in the interferogram, but the inversions suggest that they represent superficial slip that does not contribute to the overall moment release.",

            "abstract": "Secondary effects of earthquakes sometimes include widespread landsliding where strong ground motions exceed 0.2g PGA, although many earthquakes that generate sufficient ground motions do not have landsliding. For example, the South Napa earthquake of August 24, 2014 failed to produce appreciable landsliding in the presence of steep topography despite PGA estimates in excess of 0.5g. We calculate minimum strength estimates for near surface rock units using a Newmark analysis that predicts slope stability during an earthquake based on local topography, peak ground acceleration, and Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters. When considering other earthquakes with large landslide events, we determine that the minimum strength of Napa surficial rocks are comparable to total strength estimates from southern California during the 1994 Northridge and Taiwan during the 1999 Chi Chi earthquakes, but are substantially weaker than estimates from western China during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. These comparisons suggest that minimum estimates from the South Napa earthquake may be representative of the average strength. If correct, then we would predict widespread landsliding in even a slightly larger event or under wet conditions. Because rock strength at the spatial scale calculated here integrates the effects of climate, tectonic history and lithology, short-term variability due to recent rainfall and drought conditions also should be considered. Hillslope strength estimates from different earthquake events underscores the need to better quantify hillslope strength in various settings and under a range of conditions, in order to more accurately predict landslide hazards associated with large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck southern Napa county northeast of San Francisco, California, on Aug. 24, 2014, causing significant damage in the city of Napa and nearby areas. One day after the earthquake, the Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team produced and released observations of coseismic ground displacement measured with continuous GPS stations of the Plate Boundary Observatory (operated by UNAVCO for the National Science Foundation) and the Bay Area Rapid Deformation network (operated by Berkeley Seismological Laboratory). Three days after the earthquake (Aug. 27), the Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellite acquired their first post-event data. On the same day, the ARIA team, in collaboration with ASI and University of Basilicata, produced and released a coseismic interferogram that revealed ground deformation and surface rupture. The depiction of the surface rupture – discontinuities of color fringes in the CSK interferogram – helped guide field geologists from the US Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey (CGS) to features that may have otherwise gone undetected. Small-scale cracks were found on a runway of the Napa County Airport, as well as bridge damage and damaged roads. ARIA’s response to this event highlighted the importance of timeliness for mapping surface deformation features. ARIA’s rapid response products were shared through Southern California Earthquake Center’s response website and the California Earthquake Clearinghouse. A damage proxy map derived from InSAR coherence of CSK data was produced and distributed on Aug. 27. Field crews from the CGS identified true and false positives, including mobile home damage, newly planted grape vines, and a cripple wall failure of a house. Finite fault slip models constrained from CSK interferograms and continuous GPS observations reveal a north-propagating rupture with well-resolved slip from 0-10.5 km depth. We also measured along-track coseismic displacements of about -30 to 30 cm, along the main surface rupture, using multiple aperture interferometry and SAR pixel offset calculation. We also processed the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1A data on Sep. 3 and compared the result with the CSK interferogram, finding a general agreement between the two observations of surface deformation.",

Results of such a study (with a rate of false positive of 35%) give an idea on the possible relevance of RST based TIR surveys in the framework of an operational, multi-parametric system for time-Dependent Assessment of Seismic Hazard (t-DASH).\nIn this paper all the data available from the new GOES-W satellite (in orbit in between 2010 and 2014) have been analysed by the same way in the case of the earthquake occurred on 24 August 2014 (M=6) over Napa valley (California). The results presented in this paper, even if still preliminary, seem to confirm the significance of RST based TIR survey in a t-DASH perspective.\nIt should however mentioned, that such an approach (even if not devoted to be used for short-term Earthquake Forecast outside a multiparametric t-DASH system), when compared with whatever traditional OEF (Operational Earthquake Forecast) method (like the one abandoned ten years ago in US but recently re-proposed for Italy) seems already to gives forecast reliabilities of orders of magnitude greater.",

            "abstract": "Several remotely sensed datasets are now available to detect and analyze forest disturbances. Each of these regional and global datasets is estimated with varying degrees of systematic and unsystematic error (i.e., uncertainty), and so rigorous analysis of forest disturbance requires detected changes to be accompanied by estimates of error. Currently, errors are assessed predominantly by external, post hoc validation—i.e., comparison of detected changes to independent observations that are assumed to be true. However, validation yields only broadly aggregated, regional summaries of error but does not describe its spatial and temporal variation. Alternatively, modeling the propagation of error through the processes of estimation, classification, and change-detection provides an internal means to infer classification and change-detection error at a scale equivalent to that of cover and change—i.e., at pixel resolution and global extent. Using sequential observations from the first global, Landsat-based dataset of fractional tree cover, we derive and demonstrate a rigorous, probabilistic method for propagating the uncertainty of fractional tree-cover estimates to categorical forest-cover classification and change detection. Modeling tree cover as a probability distribution in each pixel represents estimation error locally and enables its transmission into inferences such as change detection. Propagation thus enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of uncertainty resulting from estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree-cover to define “forest”. The approach described here provides a useful, per-pixel description of forest classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of “forest” based on tree cover—an especially important consideration for monitoring disturbance, given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Tropical regions act as an important carbon (C) sink resulting in partial mitigation of the increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. The C sink capacity is constrained by the nutrient availability particularly of phosphorus (P) which is strongly bound to iron and aluminum oxides in highly weathered tropical soils. However, most ecosystem models neglect the P limitation mechanism that can result in overestimation of the C uptake in the terrestrial biosphere. In this study, we incorporated a P module into the process based model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM 2.0) used it to estimate the net carbon exchange (NCE: net primary productivity – heterotrophic respiration) in the tropics during 1901–2010. Specific objectives of the research are to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of NCE in the context of multiple environmental changes (e. g. land cover and land use change, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, climate, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition) as well as to quantify the magnitude of carbon uptake inhibited by P limitation in pan tropics during 1901–2010. The simulation results from DLEM 2.0 were validated against field observations on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus ratios in the foliage and plant litter pools in different geographical locations across the globe. This abstract will be updated with the results in the next few months. Our results will provide insights into P limitation influence on C uptake in the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Seismic sensors such as geophones and fiber optic have been increasingly recognized as promising technologies for intelligence surveillance, including intruder detection and perimeter defense systems. Geophone arrays have the capability to provide cost effective intruder detection in protecting assets with large perimeters. A seismic intruder detection system uses one or multiple arrays of geophones design to record seismic signals from footsteps and ground vehicles. Using a series of real-time signal processing algorithms the system detects, classify and monitors the intruder’s movement.\nWe have carried out numerical experiments to demonstrate the capability of a seismic array to detect moving targets that generate seismic signals. The seismic source is modeled as a vertical force acting on the ground that generates continuous impulsive seismic signals with different predominant frequencies. Frequency-wave number analysis of the synthetic array data was used to demonstrate the array’s capability at accurately determining intruder’s movement direction. The performance of the array was also analyzed in detecting two or more objects moving at the same time. One of the drawbacks of using a single array system is its inefficiency at detecting seismic signals deflected by large underground objects. We will show simulation results of the effect of an underground concrete block at shielding the seismic signal coming from an intruder. Based on simulations we found that multiple small arrays can greatly improve the system’s detection capability in the presence of underground structures.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344",

            "abstract": "The tectonic setting during formation of the Oman-UAE ophiolite is debated. High precision 206Pb/238U zircon dates from gabbros indicate that ridge magmatism responsible for formation of most of the ophiolite crust occurred between ~96.0–95.5 Ma. Here we present new high precision 206Pb/238U zircon dates and whole-rock Nd isotopic data from three rock sequences that constrain the development of thrusting/subduction below the ophiolite: 1. The V2 volcanic sequence and associated plutonic rocks in the ophiolite have geochemical patterns that have been interpreted as a subduction signature. V2 plutonic rocks from both Oman and the UAE have dates of ~95.6–95.0 Ma, consistent with rapid development of thrusting/subduction following formation of the ophiolite crust. 2. Felsic plutonic rocks with εNd < 0 intrude residual mantle harzburgites below the crust-mantle boundary, consistent with derivation of the magmas from a source with time-integrated LREE enrichment, such as continental crust or terrigenous sedimentary rocks. Dates on these rocks in Oman range from ~95.5–95.0, consistent with synchronous thrusting of continent derived rocks below the ophiolite during V2 magmatism. Similar intrusive rocks from the UAE are younger, ranging from ~94–91 Ma, indicating a more protracted history of thrusting and melting in this area. 3. Amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks in the sole of the ophiolite are interpreted as crust thrust beneath the ophiolite during formation or emplacement. Garnet amphibolites and small leucocratic (?) pods and veins from sole exposures in Oman are 96.0–94.7 Ma. The oldest dates are synchronous with ridge magmatism and suggest some sole amphibolites underwent metamorphism and melting while the ridge was active, favoring a supra-subduction zone model for ophiolite formation. Rocks from sole exposures in the UAE are slightly younger, ranging from 94.5–92.5 Ma. In summary, the data strongly support a supra-subduction zone model for formation of the ophiolite. If, as has been proposed, the ophiolite formed during subduction initiation, the new dates provide an unprecedented record of this process, which can be used to test and constrain geodynamic models.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling rupture propagation between fault segments during an earthquake are key to the hazard posed by fault systems. Rupture initiation on a fault segment sometimes transfers to a larger fault, resulting in a significant event (e.g.i, 2002 M7.9Denali and 2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquakes). In other cases rupture is constrained to the initial segment and does not transfer to nearby faults, resulting in events of moderate magnitude. This is the case of the 1989 M6.9 Loma Prieta and 2010 M7.0 Haiti earthquakes which initiated on reverse faults abutting against a major strike-slip plate boundary fault but did not propagate onto it. Here we investigatethe rupture dynamics of the Haiti earthquake, seeking to understand why rupture propagated across two segments of the Léogâne fault but did not propagate to the adjacenent Enriquillo Plantain Garden Fault, the major 200 km long plate boundary fault cutting through southern Haiti. We use a Finite Element Model to simulate the nucleation and propagation of rupture on the Léogâne fault, varying friction and background stress to determine the parameter set that best explains the observed earthquake sequence. The best-fit simulation is in remarkable agreement with several finite fault inversions and predicts ground displacement in very good agreement with geodetic and geological observations. The two slip patches inferred from finite-fault inversions are explained by the successive rupture of two fault segments oriented favorably with respect to the rupture propagation, while the geometry of the Enriquillo fault did not allow shear stress to reach failure. Although our simulation results replicate well the ground deformation consistent with the geodetic surface observation but convolving the ground motion with the soil amplification from the microzonation study will correctly account for the heterogeneity of the PGA throughout the rupture area.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is investing in development of a numerical modeling toolset called ASCEM (Advanced Simulation Capability for Environmental Management) to support modeling analyses at legacy waste sites. ASCEM is an open source and modular computing framework that incorporates new advances and tools for predicting contaminant fate and transport in natural and engineered systems. The ASCEM toolset includes both a Platform with Integrated Toolsets (called Akuna) and a High-Performance Computing multi-process simulator (called Amanzi). The focus of this presentation is on Akuna, an open-source user environment that manages subsurface simulation workflows and associated data and metadata. In this presentation, key elements of Akuna are demonstrated, which includes toolsets for model setup, database management, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and visualization of both model setup and simulation results. A key component of the workflow is in the automated job launching and monitoring capabilities, which allow a user to submit and monitor simulation runs on high-performance, parallel computers. Visualization of large outputs can also be performed without moving data back to local resources. These capabilities make high-performance computing accessible to the users who might not be familiar with batch queue systems and usage protocols on different supercomputers and clusters.",

            "abstract": "The San-Jacinto Fault (SJF) is the most active fault in southern California, which together with the southern San-Andreas Fault accommodates a large fraction of the motion across the plate boundary. Seismicity along the SJF is distributed over several fault segments with distinct spatio-temporal characteristics. One of these segments, known as the Anza seismic gap, is a 25 km long strand almost devoid of seismicity. In recent years, four M4-5 events occurred SE of the gap. Despite their moderate magnitudes, these earthquakes triggered rich aftershock sequences and pronounced afterslip that lasted for several weeks, and was well captured by nearby PBO borehole strain meters. A similar transient was remotely triggered by the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. Geodetic and seismic observations following a local M5.4 mainshock indicate that afterslip propagated unilaterally towards the NW at speed of about 5 km/day. We infer the distribution of slip via a joint inversion of the aftershock and strain data. Our approach is based on Dieterich's (1994) model relating the evolution of seismicity rate to applied stresses, within the framework of rate-and-state friction. This approach provides resolution power at depths inaccessible to the surface geodetic network. Moreover, it allows us to gain important insights onto the fault mechanical properties. We apply this inversion scheme to episodes that occurred during 2010. Remarkably, we find that the cumulative moment released post-seismically during the locally triggered transient is 5-10 times larger than the moment of the mainshock. We show that the data favour a model in which deep slip transients, which may develop due to local or remote earthquakes, occur on a weak, close-to-velocity-neutral fault. The transients increase the stress along the Anza gap, and trigger earthquakes outside it through static stress transfer.",

The fluctuation amplitudes can be substantial and frequencies of these flcutuations can vary. We have examined the role of the i) amplitude, ii) frequency, iii) number of the modes, iv) as well as mode combinations of magnetosheath velocity fluctuations on the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) using high-resolution macro-scale MHD simulations in magnetospheric inertial frame. The results show that even for the same magnetic field and plasma parameters across the magnetopause there can be major differences due to ‘magnetosheath fluctuation state’ on the growth and dynamical evolution of the KHI. This may provide the missing link how foreshock fluctuations couple to the magnetosphere and into the ionosphere",

            "abstract": "It is well understood that there exists a relationship between mountainous snowpack and seasonal streamflow. For snow-dominated river basins within the western United States, ~ 80% of streamflow is a result of seasonal snowmelt. In Idaho, where a significant amount of winter precipitation is stored as snowpack, predictions for the timing and magnitude of peak streamflow are essential for many water users, including water resource and irrigation managers. Of particular interest is the relationship between the timing of snowmelt and the timing of peak streamflow. While agencies such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) are tasked with the responsibility of providing water supply forecasts, few methods have used a data-driven, empirical modeling approach to investigate relationships between ablation timing monitored by the NRCS SNOTEL program and streamflow monitored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Such analyses could provide predictive tools that allow water users and managers to easily access and interpret information about peak streamflow. Idaho hosts over 80 SNOTEL sites that report hydrometeorological data, and 213 streamflow gauging stations. The goal of this study is to establish relationships between the timing of ablation at SNOTEL stations and peak streamflow within select basins in Idaho, and to synthesize results into user-friendly visualization tools that will provide estimates of the probability that peak streamflow will occur within a certain number of days as ablation progresses from 0 to 100%. In our initial test basin, the Boise River basin, we evaluated melt-out levels in increments of 10% from three SNOTEL sites located in the basin and produced cumulative density function (CDF) curves to illustrate the probability of peak streamflow occurring within a given number of days from the date at which the SNOTEL site reached each melt-out level.",

The stability of an ice shelf depend largely on whether the crevasses can grow and penetrate the entire ice thickness or will be filled with ice and eventually disappear. In light of recent observations of basal crevasses hundreds of meters wide, we use a finite element model to relax this condition and examine the effect that large basal crevasses have on the velocity and stress field within the ice shelf. The relative strength between the tensile stress pulling a crevasse open and the opposing hydrostatic pressure drawing ice in to heal can serve as a valuable proxy for determining the evolution of a crevasse, thus allowing us to infer regions vulnerable to fracture and those that are more stable based on ice shelf velocity and thickness measurements.",

In areas where the surface is frozen, lenses of water present in the subsurface may act as microbial refugia. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, the presence of highly saline brine in valley lakes raises the potential for the existence of a deep groundwater network. We report on a geophysical study that shows Lake Vida, in Victoria Valley, is nearly frozen, and the remaining brine is confined beneath thick ice. Near surface, bathymetric mapping of grounded lake ice was accomplished from a series of ground penetrating radar surveys. Radar penetration was limited to 20 m. An airborne transient electromagnetic survey (AEM) revealed a low resistivity zone at 30-100 m depth beneath the surface of the lake. Based on previous knowledge of brine chemistry and local geology, this zone is interpreted as brine saturated unconsolidated sediments with a porosity of 23-42%. Brine volume is calculated at 15 to 32 million cubic meters, which is of similar magnitude to the brine volume in nearby saline lakes. The AEM survey provided a means of quantifying the spatial extent of deep subsurface brine in this remote environment, and has provided a new perspective on the potential for subsurface habitats in areas often considered devoid of life.",

            "abstract": "In this study we quantify erosional and depositional processes in the coastal zone (including tidal flats and river channels) of the lower Ganges Brahmaputra delta (GBD). Recent availability of accurately coregistered, radiometrically intercalibrated, Landsat TM, ETM+ & OLI collected since 1988 allows for spatiotemporal (ST) analyses of both natural and anthropogenic processes in the coastal zone on seasonal to interannual time scales. We quantify changes in the coastal zone using 106 cloud-free acquisitions in the area of the 3 Landsat scenes spanning the lower delta. Changes are quantified using multitemporal spectral mixture analysis of exoatmospheric reflectance to represent land cover and water bodies as continuous fields of soil and sediment substrates (S), vegetation (V), and dark surfaces (D; water & shadow). We also use MODIS 16-day EVI composite time series and high spatial resolution (2-4 m) imagery post-2000 to extend and vicariously validate the Landsat-derived observations. Because water levels on the lower delta change by several meters on time scales of hours (tides), months (discharge) and years (relative sea level rise), we use a network of 11 tide gauges to distinguish the effects of these changes in the coastal zone imaged by Landsat. Cross spectral analysis of this network of tide gauge records quantifies the dominant periods and relative magnitudes as well as phase of water level variations across these time scales. Tide gauge records are used to identify Landsat scenes acquired at similar water levels as well as the effects of water level on variations in tidal flats. Water level and water leaving radiance are used to map spatiotemporal variations in suspended sediment. Tri-temporal change maps of SVD fractions show progressive changes of coastlines throughout the study period. We find significant change in tidal flats in acquisitions from different tidal heights, alluding to the importance of tidal phase in coastal analyses. Erosion of forested coastlines is distributed along channels of all sizes, while deposition occurs primarily in more localized regions. Expansion of mangrove forest is observed in several larger areas of deposition. These results suggest that the balance between erosion and deposition is more complex than often assumed in studies of sea level rise on the GBD.",

We compute group velocity maps for Rayleigh waves from 10 to 150 s using earthquakes recorded by broadband stations of the Network of Autonomously Recording Seismographs in Baja California and Mexico mainland, UNM in Mexico, BOR, DPP and GOR in Southern California and TUC in Arizona. The study area is gridded in 120 longitude cells by 180 latitude cells, with an equal spacing of 10 x 10 km. Assuming that each grid point is laterally homogeneous, for each period the tomographic maps are inverted to produce a 3D lithospheric shear wave velocity model for the region.\nNear the Gulf of California rift axis, we found three prominent low shear wave velocity regions, which are associated with mantle upwelling near the Cerro Prieto volcanic field, the Ballenas Transform Fault and the East Pacific Rise. Upwelling of the mantle at lithospheric and asthenospheric depths characterizes most of the Gulf. This more detailed finding is new when compared to previous surface wave studies in the region. A low velocity zone in north-central Baja at ~28ºN which extends east-south-eastward is interpreted as an asthenospheric window. In addition, we also identify a well-defined high velocity zone in the upper mantle beneath central-western Baja California, which correlates with the previously interpreted location of the stalled Guadalupe and Magdalena microplates. We interpret locations of the fossil slab and slab window in light of the distribution of unique post-subduction volcanic rocks in the Gulf of California and Baja California. We also observe a high velocity anomaly at 50 km depth extending down to ~130 km near the southwestern Baja coastline and beneath Baja, which may represent another remnant of the Farallon slab.",

            "abstract": "NWA 8159 is a olivine-bearing, fine-grained augite basalt from Mars with SNC-like oxygen isotopes and Fe/Mn values. The sample consists of augite, plagioclase (An50-65), olivine (Fa61-76), magnetite and minor orthopyroxene. NWA 8159 has several mm-thick shock-melt veins that have crystallized to a fine-grained granular mixture of silicate and sulfide with a texture unlike that seen in other shocked meteorites. Raman spectra from the veins suggest a Ca-rich garnet in the veins. Although the shock effects in this sample are similar to those of other Martian meteorites, the plagioclase remains anisotropic (crystalline) with polysynthetic twinning and fractures throughout much of the sample. In the vicinity of shock veins, the plagioclase is isotropic and stoichiometric with undisturbed grain boundaries and no fractures. Some plagioclase in contact with shock melt has transformed to tissintite (Ca-jadelite like pyroxene). Fayalitic olivine is partially transformed to ahrensite (spinel) in contact with shock melt. As in several other shocked Martian meteorites, olivine is also transformed into a nanometer-scale mixture of oxide and silicate. Raman spectra from these areas are consistent with the presence of magnetite, rather than magnesiowüstite, as seen in other samples. Minor quartz grains have radiating fractures through the surrounding minerals indicative of partial back transformation from a high-density phase. Raman spectra from this material indicates stishovite and coesite. The coexistence of crystalline plagioclase and maskelynite suggests a moderate shock pressure of 16 – 23 GPa. However, the association of maskelynite and other transformation features with shock veins indicates the importance of high temperatures in creating heterogeneous shock features. Nanometer-scale mineralogy and transformation nano-structures will be investigated in FIB sections with analytical TEM to better constrain the mineralogy, transformation mechanisms and shock conditions.",

Its activity is characterized by a permanent emission of a gas plume, occasionally interrupted by vulcanian eruptions, and less frequently by sub-plinian eruptions. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of thermal anomaly variations detected in its active crater using Landsat TM and ETM+ images, combined with ground-based measurements, has allowed us to establish an eruptive pattern and relate it to magma circulation. Low intensity eruptions are related to degassing pathways obstruction induced by partial collapse of inner walls of active crater, which produce a decreasing of gas released to atmosphere and consequently an increasing of internal pressure in the magmatic system by volatile accumulation. In this case, low intensity thermal anomalies are detected, with heat flux of 75-765 MW. At critical pressures, energy is liberated as vulcanian eruptions, with columns no higher than 8 km altitude, releasing exclusively non-juvenile products (e.g. July 2000, December 2003 eruptions). After low intensity eruptions, thermal anomalies and heat flux values increase reaching up to 1,005-10,527 MW. On the other hand, high intensity eruptions seems to be related to influx of new and high temperature magma in a cold and more evolved magma chamber, which induce to eruptive processes characterized by emission of columns higher than 15 km altitude and production of pyroclastic flows by column collapse (e.g. April 1993 sub-plinian eruption). Despite previous to high intensity eruptions thermal anomalies and heat flux decrease, during high intensity eruptions heat flux can reach up 867,000 MW, returning subsequently to lower flux values (~10,000 MW).",

Alignment of programming with items “newsworthy” enough to attract media attention on their own can result in effective program promotion at low/no cost. Similarly, awareness and avoidance of dates upon which media and public attention will likely be elsewhere can keep programs from being lost in the noise.\nNASA has created a useful and entertaining app called “SPACE 365” to help supply that foreknowledge. The app contains an extensive database of historical aviation and Space exploration-related events, along with other events and birthdays to provide socio-historical context, as well as an extensive file of present and future space missions, complete with images and videos. The user can search by entry topic category, date, and key words. Upcoming Events allows the user to plan, participate, and engage in significant “don’t miss” happenings.\nThe historical database was originally developed for use at the National Air and Space Museum, then expanded significantly to include more NASA-related information. The CIMA team at NASA MSFC, sponsored by the Planetary Science Division, added NASA current events and NASA educational programming information, and are continually adding new information and improving the functionality and features of the app.\nFeatures of SPACE 365 now include: NASA Image of the Day, Upcoming NASA Events, Event Save, Do Not Miss, and Ask Dr. Steve functions, and the CIMA team recently added a new start page and added improved search and navigation capabilities. App users can now socialize the Images of the Day via Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, and other social media outlets.\nSPACE 365 is available at no cost from both the Apple appstore and GooglePlay, and has helped NASA, NASM, and other educators plan and schedule programming events.

            "abstract": "The ecosystem services provided by wetlands are widely recognized but difficult to quantify. In particular, estimating the effect of landcover and land use on downstream flood outcomes remains challenging, but is increasingly important in light of climate change predictions of increased precipitation in many areas. Economic valuation can help incorporate ecosystem services into decisions and enable communities to plan for climate and flood resiliency. Here we estimate the economic value of Otter Creek wetlands for Middlebury, VT in mitigating the flood that followed Tropical Storm Irene, as well as for ten historic floods. Observationally, hydrographs above and below the wetlands in the case of each storm indicated the wetlands functioned as a temporary reservoir, slowing the delivery of water to Middlebury. We compare observed floods, based on Middlebury’s hydrograph, with simulated floods for scenarios without wetlands. To simulate these “without wetlands” scenarios, we assume the same volume of water was delivered to Middlebury, but in a shorter time pulse similar to a hydrograph upstream of the wetlands. For scenarios with and without wetlands, we map the spatial extent of flooding using LiDAR digital elevation data. We then estimate flood depth at each affected building, and calculate monetary losses as a function of the flood depth and house value using established depth damage relationships. For example, we expect damages equal to 20% of the houses value for a flood depth of two feet in a two-story home with a basement. We define the value of flood mitigation services as the difference in damages between the with and without wetlands scenario, and find that the Otter Creek wetlands reduced flood damage in Middlebury by 88% following Hurricane Irene. Using the 10 additional historic floods, we estimate an ongoing mean value of $400,000 in avoided damages per year. Economic impacts of this magnitude stress the importance of wetland conservation and warrant the consideration of ecosystem services in land use decisions. Our study indicates that here and elsewhere, green infrastructure may have to potential to increase the resilience of communities to projected changes in climate.",

Economic damages were estimated to exceed 2 billion USD. Images collected by optical and RADAR sensors on satellites operated by seven countries, along with archived satellite imagery were rapidly processed and provided to first-responders in these states for planning relief efforts. This operation required collaboration among numerous international, national and local agencies, and data vendors. This presentation will share the experiences gained as the project manager of this activation and will highlight the Charter’s role in requesting satellite imagery for disasters, identifying experts to process these data, and getting the information to first responders in a timely manner. Lessons learned in terms of addressing the needs of first responders from multi-state agencies will also be highlighted.",

            "abstract": "The rapid retreat of many glaciers in the monsoonal Himalaya is of potential societal concern. However, the retreat pattern in the region has been very heterogeneous, likely due in part to the inherent heterogeneity of climate and glaciers within the region. Assessing the impacts of glacier change on water resources, hydroelectric power, and hazard potential requires a detailed understanding of this potentially complex spatial pattern of glacier sensitivity to climate change. Here we quantify glacier surface-mass balance and meltwater flux across the entire glacierized region of the Bhutanese watershed using a full surface-energy and –mass balance model validated with field data. We then test the sensitivity of the glaciers to climatic change and compare the results to a thirty-year record of glacier volume changes. Bhutan is chosen because it (1) sits in the bulls-eye of the monsoon, (2) has >600 glaciers that exhibit the extreme glacier heterogeneity typical of the Himalayas, and (3) faces many of the economic and hazard challenges associated with glacier changes in the Himalaya. Therefore, the methods and results from this study should be broadly applicable to other regions of the monsoonal Himalaya.\nOur modeling results show a complex spatial pattern of glacier sensitivity to changes in climate across the Bhutanese Himalaya. However, our results also show that <15% of the glaciers in Bhutan account for >90% of the total meltwater flux, and that these glaciers are uniformly the glaciers most sensitive to changes in temperature (and less sensitive to other climate variables). We compare these results to a thirty-year record of glacier volume changes over the same region. In particular, we extract DEMs and orthorectified imagery from 1976 historical spy satellite images and 2006 ASTER images. DEM differencing shows that the glaciers that have changed most over the past thirty years also have the highest modeled temperature sensitivity. These results suggest that, despite the complex glacier heterogeneity in the region, the regional meltwater resources are controlled by a very small percentage of the glaciers, and that these glaciers are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics and the transport mechanisms of fluidmud is crucial to illuminate the details regarding the attenuation in the surface wave energy over muddy seabed and wave-supported gravity-driven mud flows that take place in nearshore environments. Although there is significant progress through theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies, little attention has been drawn to the intricate alteration in the fluidmud transport over bedforms that inherently exist in the actual field conditions. Specifically, interfacial waves at the fluidmud interface were observed in coastal Louisiana as a part of MURI field experiments in 2010. It is also observed that wave attenuation was dominated by viscous processes during laminar flow and attenuation decreased duing the transition to turbulence. Considering the slow growth of shear instability at the interface, bed forms have a critical role to initiate the growth of interfacial waves and the subsequent transition to turbulence. In this study, we investigate the role of bed forms on the dynamics of moderately thin fluidmud layer via large eddy simulations. Three mud viscosity values, based on the field observations, are tested for a 20 centimeters of mud layer over ripples: (i)ν = 1 x 10-3, (ii) ν = 1 x 10-4 , and (iii) ν = 1 x 10-5 . In Case (i), wave energy dissipation is nearly the same as the one over a flat bed. Case (ii) shows that there is a 10 to 20 percent increase in the wave energy dissipation especially at the fluidmud interface. Finally, in Case (iii), we observe the high-energy transitional flow characteristics. In this presentation, we shall also share the detailed analyses of these simulations.",

            "abstract": "A loose-coupling of a basin-scale hydrological and sediment flux model with a\ncoastal ocean hydrodynamics model is used to assess the importance of\nuncertainties in river mouth locations and fluxes on coastal geomorphology of\nthe Mekong river delta. At the land-ocean interface, river deltas mediate the\nflux of water, sediment, and nutrients from the basin watershed, though the\ncomplex delta river network, and into the coastal ocean. In the Mekong river\ndelta, irrigation networks and surface water storage for rice cultivation\nredistribute, in space and time, water and sediment fluxes along the coastline.\nDistribution of fluxes through the delta is important for accurate assessment of\ndelta land aggregation, coastline migration, and coastal ocean biogeochemistry.\nUsing a basin-scale hydrological model, WBMsed, interfaced with a coastal\nhydrodynamics/wave/sediment model, COAWST, we investigate freshwater and\nsediment plumes and morphological changes to the subaqueous delta front. There\nis considerable uncertainty regarding how the delta spatially filters water and\nsediment fluxes as they transit through the river and irrigation network. By\nadjusting the placement and relative distribution of WBMsed discharge along the\ncoast, we estimate the resulting bounds on sediment plume structure, timing, and\nmorphological deposition patterns. The coastal ocean model is validated by\ncomparing simulated plume structure and seasonality to MERIS and MODIS derived\nestimates of surface turbidity. We find good agreement with regards to plume\nextent and timing, with plumes weakest in the early spring, extending strongly\nto the west in the fall, and toward the east in winter. Uncertainty regarding\nriver outflow distribution along the coastline leads to substantial uncertainty\nin rates of morphological change, particularly away from the main Mekong River\ndistributary channels.",

            "abstract": "Silver Lake is the modern terminal playa of the Mojave River. As a result, it is well located to record both influences from the winter precipitation dominated San Bernardino Mountains – the source of the Mojave River – as well as the late-summer to early-fall North American monsoon. Here, we present various physical and geochemical data from a new 8.2 m sediment core taken from Silver Lake, CA that spans modern through 14.8 kcal yrs BP. Age control is based on six bulk organic C radiocarbon dates processed with Bacon v2.2 to generate an age model. Texturally, the core varies between a silty clay and a silty sand, often with abrupt sedimentological transitions. Our working hypothesis states that high percent clay values indicate persistent standing water wherein the deposition, accumulation, and preservation of fine grain sediment exceeds some undefined thickness that inhibits deflation during succeeding desiccation events or ephemeral lake environments. Based on this clay – lake status hypothesis, the sediment core is divided into five lake status intervals. Clay values are highest between 14.4 – 13.5 kcal yrs BP, coeval to Lake Mojave II. Clay values decrease abruptly at 13.5 kcal yrs BP (encapsulating the Younger Dryas) indicating a return to an ephemeral lake. At 11.3 kcal yrs BP, clay values rise abruptly indicating a return to a perennial lake; this early Holocene pluvial ended abruptly at 7.8 kcal yrs BP. From 7.8 – 4.2 kcal yrs BP, clay is low, but variable and mudcracks are common. At 4.2 kcal yrs BP, clay values increase but only moderately indicating a return to more frequent sustained perennial lakes. The early Holocene pluvial is likely a result of higher summer insolation, which generated a more intense and spatially expansive North American monsoon. Coupled with lower winter insolation and thus more winter storms across the region, Silver Lake flourished. A comparison to stable carbon isotope data from Leviathan Cave (NV), support our interpretation as indicated by more productive soils (i.e., wetter) (Lachniet et al., 2014). The resurgence of a wet Mojave ca. 4.2 kcal yrs BP is also supported by the NV cave data. We attribute this late Holocene pluvial to the strengthening of El Niño.",

            "abstract": "During the last years, volcanic activity at Mt. Etna was often characterized by cyclic occurrences of fountains. In the period between January 2011 and June 2013, 38 episodes of lava fountains has been observed. Automatic recognition of the volcano’s states related to lava fountain episodes (Quiet, Pre-Fountaining, Fountaining, Post-Fountaining) is very useful for monitoring purposes. We discovered that such states are strongly related to the trend of RMS (Root Mean Square) of the seismic signal recorded in the summit area.\nIn the framework of the project PON SIGMA (Integrated Cloud-Sensor System for Advanced Multirisk Management) work, we tried to model the system generating its sampled values (assuming to be a Markov process and assuming that RMS time series is a stochastic process), by using Hidden Markov models (HMMs), that are a powerful tool for modeling any time-varying series. HMMs analysis seeks to discover the sequence of hidden states from the observed emissions. In our framework, observed emissions are characters generated by SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) technique. SAX is able to map RMS time series values with discrete literal emissions. Our experiments showed how to predict volcano states by means of SAX and HMMs.",

            "abstract": "The Great Salt Lake (GSL) and Utah Lake (UL) in northern Utah are in the middle of the Intermountain Seismic Belt, a band of active seismicity extending from western Montana through central Utah to northern Arizona. The proximity of these water bodies to an active earthquake zone is ideal for an investigation of lake-triggered seismicity. Both GSL and UL are shallow (10 and 4.3 m, respectively). The fresh water UL drains via the Jordan River into the salty GSL, which has no outlet. GSL has an aerial extent of 4400 km2, and the shallow depth and lack of outlet cause the surface area to change greatly as the lake volume increases and decreases. UL is much smaller with an almost constant aerial extent of 385 km2. For each lake, we compare yearly earthquake counts near the lake to yearly average lake level for years 1975-2013. GSL seismicity and lake level data correlate well, with seismicity increasing 3-5 years after lake level rise (cross correlation coefficient=0.56, P-value=0.0005). There is an especially large increase in seismicity in 1989 NE of the GSL following the historic lake level high stand in the mid-1980s. The 1989 seismicity has characteristics of both a swarm and a traditional mainshock/aftershock sequence. We will use a double-difference method (HypoDD) to relocate these earthquakes. UL seismicity does not correlate well with the lake level. The different results for the two lakes could perhaps be explained by the lakes’ different sizes and the fact that UL has an outlet while GSL does not. The difference might also be explained by subsurface fluid pathways and available faults for nucleating earthquakes. We will further explore the significance of the GSL seismicity and lake level correlation by generating synthetic earthquake catalogs and cross correlating their yearly earthquake counts with the lake level data.",

The DEM is based on the 3534 photos used in the aero-triangulation which were recorded by the Danish Geodata Agency (then the Geodetic Institute) in survey campaigns spanning the period 1978-1987. The GrIS is covered tens of kilometers into the interior due to the large footprints of the photos (30 x 30 km) and control provided by the aero-triangulation. Thus, the data are ideal for providing information for analysis of ice marginal elevation change and also control for satellite-derived DEMs.\nThe results of the validation, error assessments and predicted uncertainties are presented. We test the DEM using Airborne Topographic Mapper (IceBridge ATM) as reference data; evaluate the a posteriori covariance matrix from the aero-triangulation; and co-register DEM blocks of 50 x 50 km to ICESat laser altimetry in order to evaluate the coherency.\nWe complement the aero-photogrammetric DEM with modern laser altimetry and DEMs derived from stereoscopic satellite imagery (AST14DMO) to examine the mass variability of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS). Our analysis suggests that dynamically-induced mass loss started around 2003 and continued throughout 2014.",

They are the main components of the tropical intraseasonal oscillation (TISO). Both these events are important because of the extent of their respective influences geographically, materially in demography and economics and temporally as their subseasonality connects weather forecasts to climate predictions. This study investigates whether these principal intraseasonal oscillations (ISO) are same or different over the Indo-Pacific tropical region by using mechanistic experiments run on an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), CAM4.0. We try to better understand the eastward propagation common to both MISO and MJO, through a few idealized experiments and experiments where observational signals are applied. In the idealized experiments a very narrow band of idealized eastward propagating heating and cooling signal is applied to the temperature tendency of CAM4.0 over the Indo-Pacific equatorial belt. In the observational experiments, observed diabatic heating MISO and MJO signals are added to CAM4.0, again over the Indo-Pacific region. These experiments are run during boreal summer (JJAS) and boreal winter (DJFM) separately. The response of temperature tendency meridionally will be discussed. The response and changes both zonally and meridionally in circulation, specific humidity and diabatic heating of the model will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we report the results of a few case studies of multi-point magnetic field measurements of field-aligned currents (FACs) from Swarm constellation mission to understand their temporal and spatial characteristics. During the commissioning phase, the three Swarm spacecraft were in an identical polar orbit with a string-of-pearl configuration with small separations. During the science operational phase (since April, 2014), the three spacecraft were placed in slightly different polar orbits: one spacecraft in a higher altitude orbit (507km x 512km) and two side-by-side in lower altitude orbits (459km x 462km). We analyze a few FAC events in both orbital phases and during periods of active geomagnetic conditions. The multi-point observations enable us to examine the FACs’ temporal evolution and separate their temporal and spatial variations.",

            "abstract": "Iceberg calving is a major process involved in the removal of large volumes of ice from ice sheets to the oceans, but remains relatively poorly understood. The part of the puzzle that remains the least clear is the dynamics involved in the transition between intact glacier ice and rapid fragmentation during calving events. Because calving is a sudden rapid event, it is often the case that what gets captured by satellite observation is the before and after, rather than the exact moment of failure. Here we exploit this fact and use a statistical approach using a collapse model to investigate whether or not there exists a quantifiable critical fracture density, or \"critical mass\" of closely-spaced fractures, beyond which dynamic fragmentation of the glacier occurs. To do this we study the size distribution of fragments in proglacial mélange, using this information to infer physical properties of the pre-collapsed ice, such as material strength and the energy necessary to create a fragmentation event using methods widely applied in civil and even weapons engineering, but not previously applied in a glaciological context. Characterizing fracture density at different locations and quantifying a critical factor to describe the transition from highly-fractured to collapse/fragmentation region enable us to understand the distribution of observable surface fracture patterns and underlying differences within regions of individual glaciers and between glaciers. This investigation is well-served by the only-recently-available high resolution data over Greenland’s glaciers by LandSat, MODIS and Operation IceBridge, among others. While many studies have focused on the propagation of crevasses in the glacier ice as a means of predicting calving, the main goal of this work is to consider the physical transition between the two phases of collapse. As such, our work focuses (1) on the pre-collapse state as characterized by crevasse pattern formation in the glacier, or level of damage present; and (2) on the post-collapse state as characterized by proglacial mélange properties. Application of these techniques to glaciers yield insight into the processes leading up to collapse and enable us to determine critical parameters such as critical fracture density, antecedent to collapse events.",

            "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of chemical transport from the landscape to streams is necessary for water quality management. Previous work has shown that estimates of the distribution of water age in streams, the transit time distribution (TTD), can improve prediction of the concentration of conservative tracers (i.e., ones that “follow the water”) based on upstream watershed inputs. A major challenge however has been accounting for climate and transport variability when estimating TDDs at the catchment scale. In this regard, Harman (2014, in review) proposed the Omega modeling framework capable of using watershed hydraulic fluxes to approximate the time-varying TTD. The approach was previously applied to the Plynlimon research watershed in Wales to simulate stream concentration dynamics of a conservative tracer (chloride) including 1/f attenuation of the power spectra density. In this study we explore the extent to which TTDs estimated by the Omega model vary with the concentration of non-conservative tracers (i.e., ones whose concentrations are also affected by transformations and interactions with other phases). First we test the hypothesis that the TTD calibrated in Plynlimon can explain a large part of the variation in non-conservative stream water constituents associated with storm flow (acidity, Al, DOC, Fe) and base flow (Ca, Si). While controlling for discharge, we show a correlation between the percentage of water of different ages and constituent concentration. Second, we test the hypothesis that TTDs help explain variation in stream nitrate concentration, which is of particular interest for pollution control but can be highly non-conservative. We compare simulation runs from Plynlimon and the agricultural Choptank watershed in Maryland, USA. Following a top-down approach, we estimate nitrate concentration as if it were a conservative tracer and examine the structure of residuals at different temporal resolutions. Finally, we consider model modifications to account for the effects of nitrogenous biogeochemical transformations.",

            "abstract": "The Palgongsan Granite which intruded into the Cretaceous Gyengsang Basin in SE Korea is elongated in NW-SE direction (ca. 2.4 aspect ratio of long axis to short in exposure) and is generally thought as being emplaced along the WNW-ESE trending Palgongsan Fault which is the boundary between the Uiseong sub-basin (north) and Miryang sub-basin (south) within the basin.\nIt is widely believed that emplacement of the pluton along the sub-basin boundary removed all evidence associated with the faulting. Recent studies of gravity and aeromagnetic anomalies in the vicinity of the granite imply that the emplacement of this pluton was controlled by the geometry of WNW-ESE trending right-lateral overstepping lineaments. It gives us an opportunity to examine the controlling factors for emplacement such as the internal structural characteristics of the pluton, thermal cooling history, residual magmatic fluid pressure, and external regional stress regime.\nWithin the granite, pegmatitic dykes and hydrothermal deposits related to the late stages of intrusion are frequently observed and penetrative joints and faults are also well developed. The study of orientation, distribution, relative cross-cutting relationships and kinematics based on the indicators of each structural element coupled with geochronological and geophysical data provides information of the prevailing stress regime at the time of dyke intrusions and the controlling structures, such as strike-slip overstepping and dilational linkage. The results of 3-D mohr-circle analysis for NW-SE trending dykes show they intruded under vertical σ1 and NE-SW horizontal σ3 in low differential stress and relatively high residual pressure of magmatic fluid. This coincided with regional NW-SE horizontal σ1 and NE-SW horizontal σ3 direction based on other structural analysis.\nAlthough these results imply the possibility that the pluton was emplaced in a dilational overstep along a WNW-ESE reactivated dextral strike-slip fault, felsic intrusions in the upper crust are not only controlled by pre-existing structures but are also controlled by other factors such as magmatic flow behavior. Therefore further studies such as magnetic anisotropy suspension and seismic exploration are required to fully understand the mode of emplacement of the Palgongsan Granite.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by transient stresses carried by seismic waves. There are several features of triggering that require explanation, including 1) the often-observed delay between the triggering waves and the triggered earthquakes, and 2) the effectiveness of transient stressing in the seismic frequency band. Previous theoretical and laboratory work has suggested that seismic transients should have little impact on faults if the duration of the transient is smaller than the timescale for nucleation of slip. We examine stress triggering during laboratory stick-slip sliding of granite and focus on several observations that pertain to earthquake triggering in nature. 1) Delayed triggering (clock advance) occurs when slip accumulates during the transient but remains below a critical value dc. 2) Delayed and instantaneous triggering both occur much earlier in the stick-slip cycle than expected for a simple Coulomb threshold. 3) Shorter-period (higher stressing-rate) pulses are more effective at triggering than longer-period pulses of the same stress amplitude. We use numerical simulations to show that rate-state friction can explain each of the observed features, but not all three simultaneously. Only the Ruina slip law can reproduce the observations of stressing-rate dependence and early triggering onset. The Dieterich aging law predicts only duration-dependent triggering with relatively late triggering onset. The observations show that moderate-amplitude, short-period transients can have a strong triggering effect even at durations far below the nucleation timescale. Transient oscillations at seismic frequencies may therefore be more effective at earthquake triggering than previously recognized.",

            "abstract": "The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 345 sampled lower crustal primitive gabbroic rocks that formed at the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) and are exposed at the Hess Deep Rift. The metamorphic mineral assemblages in the rocks recovered at Site U1415 record the cooling of primitive gabbroic lithologies from magmatic (>1000°C) to zeolite facies conditions (<200°C) associated with EPR spreading, Cocos-Nazca rifting and exposure onto the seafloor. The dominant alteration assemblage is characterized by lower grade greenschist (<400°C) and subgreenschist facies (<200°C) alteration of olivine to talc, serpentine, or clay minerals, and is commonly accompanied by prehnite microveins in plagioclase. The intensity of alteration varies with igneous lithology, in particular, the modal abundance of olivine, as well as proximity to zones of brittle fracturing and cataclasis. We have attempted to characterize the nature and extent of isotopic exchange associated alteration and cooling and present a record of variations in O, Sr, and Nd isotopic compositions in altered rocks from the lower plutonic crust at Hess Deep. The Rb-Sr and 18O/16O systems exhibit sensitivity to hydrothermal interactions with seawater; whereas the Sm-Nd system appears essentially undisturbed by the minimal alteration experienced by the rocks drilled at Site U1415. The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic compositions of olivine gabbros (Mg# 0.81-0.89) range from 0.702536-0.703950 (±0.000008). Higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios are strongly correlated with percentage of hydrous minerals, and are higher in samples with a greater modal abundance of olivine. These rocks have somewhat higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios than upper plutonic rocks from the Northern Escarpment at Hess Deep (Kirchner and Gillis, 2012), although their percentage of hydrous phases is apparently similar. The d18O in these rocks ranges from 0.23‰ to 4.65‰ (±0.67); troctolites have systematically lower d18O than the gabbro and gabbronorites. Preliminary Nd isotopic data appears to be consistent with previous measurements from the Site 894 gabbros, implying derivation from depleted MORB (e.g. Pedersen et al., 1996).",

            "abstract": "In central Peru the combination of an unusually shallow Wadati-Benioff zone and lack of arc volcanism are indicators of flat slab subduction and are associated with both the ongoing subduction of the Nazca Ridge and the prior subduction of the Inca Plateau. Data from the PULSE experiment has allowed us to better constrain the geometry of the southern half of the Peruvian flat slab through analysis of teleseismic receiver functions, Pn and Sn phases from regional intermediate (>100 km depth) and deep (>500 km depth) earthquakes at the margins of the flat slab region, and teleseismic tomgraphy.\nWe observe a low velocity anomaly below the subducted portion of the Nazca Ridge in the teleseismic S-wave tomography. Utilizing both Pn and Sn phases from regional intermediate and deep earthquakes at the margins of the flat slab, we have found significant travel time delays for propagation paths passing through this anomaly, confirming the presence of this low velocity anomaly under the flat slab. This anomaly likely contributes to the buoyancy of this segment of the flat slab, increasing the coupling with the upper plate. Both the teleseismic tomographic and our receiver function results indicate that the southern segment of the Peruvian flat slab extends locally more than 100 km further inboard than previous estimates. As the shallow portion of the slab inboard of the subducting Nazca Ridge is largely aseismic, these new results help to better constrain the geometry of the Peruvian flat slab as it re-subducts back into the mantle. Between 10°S and 16°S the subducted oceanic crust along the inboard projection of the Nazca Ridge lies at a depth of 60 km to 70 km while subducted crust immediately north and south of the ridge projection lies at depths of 80 km to 90 km suggesting the slab is sinking north and south of the ridge. The unusually shallow depth of the slab along the ridge’s projection may indicate that the subducted Nazca Plate is coupled to the South American Plate far inboard from the trench. This coupling may be causing deformation beyond the active Andean thrust front. The Fitzcarrald Arch, a long-wavelength topographic feature along the ridge’s projection and east of the edge of Andean deformation, lies immediately inboard of our shallowest observed subducted oceanic crust and may be an example of this coupling induced deformation.",

            "abstract": "During magnetic storms, the concentration of O+ ions in the ring current can increase substantially. The mechanisms that energize these O+ ions so that they gain enough energy to escape from the ionosphere into the magnetosphere have long been debated. The highly sensitive HOPE (Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron) instrument onboard the Van Allen Probe satellites provide an opportunity to investigate this problem. The two satellites are in nearly identical highly-elliptical, low-inclination (~10°) orbits with a perigee of 1.1 Earth radii (RE), an apogee of 5.8 RE, and a period of ~9 hours. We study a storm event whose SSC occurred near 15:00 UT on 31 May 2013 followed by a lengthy initial phase. The main phase began early on 1 June, reaching a Sym-H minimum of - 134 nT at 07:54 UT. We have identified a large energetic proton enhancement event which is marked by a significant increase in the fluxes of high-energy ions in the deep portion of the main phase. We concentrate on the relative dynamics of H+ and O+. From 03:00 UT to 06:50 UT, there were a few quasi-periodic enhancements of O+ fluxes in the 200 eV to 3.5 keV energy range. A Fourier analysis shows clear power around 30 min periods and excellent coherence among these channels. These enhancements further show clear dispersion with high-energy channels increasing first followed by lower energy channels. During the event, the satellites were near the apogee in the pre-midnight local time sector. The location of the source region can be inferred by energy dispersion based on the time-of-flight effect. One may show that if the particles in different energies were produced at the same time and location, time is linearly correlated with the reciprocal of square-root of the energy for the enhanced fluxes and the source distance can be derived by the slope of the lines of enhanced fluxes. During the event, we identified 8 such enhancements. The sources of these O+ ions appear to be from similar distance to the satellite. Other features during the event will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic data images mantle regions more conductive than that of dry olivine. There is no doubt that melt is thermodynamically stable and present in the LAB, but how they can impact on mantle electrical conductivity remains debated. In addition, gravitational segregation and fast melt upwelling, being expected if melt fraction exceeds 2 vol. %, is thought to seriously restrict the role of partial melting at the level of the LAB. Petrological studies realized some 30 years ago have shown that peridotites exposed at the P-T-fO2 conditions of the LAB produced H2O and CO2 rich-melts. The segregation of such melts is not expected since they constitute only about 0.5 vol. % of the peridotite, but electrical conductivities of these melts are poorly known.\nTherefore, electrical conductivity experiments have been performed in piston cylinder on H2O-CO2 rich melts. Different melt compositions have been explored, from carbonated melts to basalts. The effects of chemical compositions and volatiles on these melts have been determined. The electrical conductivity measurements have shown that hydrous carbonated melts are very conductive, and the incorporation of basalt decreases the conductivity. With these new data, a semi-empirical law predicting the conductivity as a function of H2O and CO2 contents has been produced. Based on this law and the electrical conductivity of olivine, 1D conductivity profiles were constructed. With these profiles, the effect of volatiles content (partitioned between the melt and in the solids), melt fractions (mixing law and interconnection of the melt) and different temperature regimes on conductivity are discussed. These calculations are conducted on oceanic and continental settings with different ages. The electrical conductivities of the mantle is thus a powerful tool to track the fundamental process of mantle incipient melting, which is in turn narrowly associated to the cycling of H2O and CO2 in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "We use an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 1000 observations of Io in [OI] 6300A, presented by Oliversen et al. (2001), narrow-band images of the torus in [SII] 6731A, and HST/STIS EUV observations of Io and its environs to confirm that the Io [OI] flux is an excellent proxy for the electron density in the Io plasma to torus (IPT). Furthermore, we find:\n(1) A careful statistical analysis of short-term variations in this dataset (20 min to 1 hour), previously suspected to be from flux tube interchange (Oliversen et al. 2001, Morgenthaler et al. 2012) are, in fact, consistent with the expected statistical variation of the parent population of observations.\n(2) The semi-empirical IPT model developed by W. Smyth (Oliversen et al. 2001; Smyth, Peterson, & Marconi 2011) fits the overall trends in the data reasonably well, with notable exceptions.\n(3) There may be a link between what was previously known the \"active sector\" at system III longitudes of 170 ~ 230 degrees and the modulation in IPT plasma density caused by the beating between system III and system IV, predicted by Hess et al. (2011).\nConclusion: a simple modification to the W. Smyth semi-empirical torus model to incorporate a system IV-controlled density enhancement, rather than a fixed \"active sector\" in system III, should enable the model to \"lock in\" more readily to our extensive set of [OI] 6300A observations recorded between 1990 and 2008. This will provide detailed information about the flow of mass and energy in the IPT during the Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons missions. Additional observations are planned during NASA's upcoming Juno mission.\nThis work was supported by NASA Planetary Research Program RTOP 344-32-40 to GSFC and grants NAGW-3319 and NAG5-6787 to the University of Wisconsin--Madison, STIS contract NAS5-30131 to the University of Wisconsin--Madison and NASA Outer Planets Research Program grant NNX11AM43G to PSI.",

            "abstract": "Morphodynamic feedbacks result in alternating bars within channels, and the resulting convective accelerations dictate the cross-stream force balance of channels and in turn influence morphology. Pioneer woody riparian trees recruit on river bars and may steer flow and alter this force balance. This study uses two-dimensional hydraulic modeling to test the sensitivity of the flow field to riparian vegetation at the reach scale. We use two test systems with different width-to-depth ratios, substrate sizes, and vegetation structure: the gravel-bed Bitterroot River, MT and the sand-bed Santa Maria River, AZ. We model vegetation explicitly as a drag force by spatially specifying vegetation density, height, and drag coefficient, across varying hydraulic (e.g., discharge, eddy viscosity) conditions and compare velocity vectors between runs. We test variations in vegetation configurations, including the present-day configuration of vegetation in our field systems (extracted from LiDAR), removal of vegetation (e.g., from floods or management actions), and expansion of vegetation. Preliminary model runs suggest that the sensitivity of convective accelerations to vegetation reflects a balance between the extent and density of vegetation inundated and other sources of channel roughness. This research quantifies how vegetation alters hydraulics at the reach scale, a fundamental step to understanding vegetation-morphodynamic interactions.",

            "abstract": "Zeravshan a transboundary river in Central Asia is a snow-glacier fed river originating in Tajikistan that use only 4% of its resources, further flows to Uzbekistan who fully utilize river resources for irrigation. Such disparity in river usage causes Tajikistan to consider heavy investments in hydropower dams that will increase social and political tension between counterparts. Traditional irrigation under arid climate causes high rates of water losses in infiltration and evapotranspiration leading to land. Water stress analysis and water resources distribution under climate change and possible adaptation measures were investigated. The framework includes model to analyze available water resources and assessment of the basin efficiency including dam operation and irrigation demand, based on it adaptation measures were suggested. Comparison of the increasing irrigation efficiency in downstream to the 10% rate can decrease water requirements on early stages, however there are still large deficiency of the water resources in the peak irrigation season. Dam operation to benefit irrigation has positive impact while can't compensate the needs of energy in winter months. Cooperation of the both sides are required to address such changes in river flow as interest lies on opposite side. Increasing irrigation efficiency through using return marginal waters and salt tolerant crops under water stress were suggested. The plants were tested on several sites in the downstream of the river using mineralized return waters. The results suggest that using such plants can provide additional outcome for the local community while decreasing demand of the water resources and improving soil conditions. Combination of dam operation for energy production and increasing irrigation efficiency additionally by using return waters can provide a beneficial scenario for the region under future climate change. However, it will require strong political will to address energy swap to achieve nexus on water resources distribution between counterparts.",

The surface quantitative precipitation (QPE) may have considerable errors if vertical structure of precipitation is not considered. It has been realized that the vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) information is very useful for accurately estimating the surface rainfall. Researchers at the University of Oklahoma have incorporated VPR information from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) to the Multi-Radar Multi- Sensor system. In the latest progress in the VPR-Identification and Enhancement (VPR-IE) approach, we have optimally combined the climatological VPR information with real-time TRMM-PR observation. Performance of latest hybrid VPR-IE is comprehensively evaluated for the Mountainous West Region of the U.S. Results indicate greater improvements in precipitation estimation following the hybrid VPR-IE methods compared to pure climatological VPR corrections. With the recent availability of GPM Dual-frequency PR, the VPR-IE approach is anticipated to be more robust and more useful by extending to higher latitude mountainous regions.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying anthropogenic sources of CO2 is imperative yet challenging. Here, we present data assimilation experiments to assess the information gain in using current satellite observations of atmospheric constituents that are co-­emitted during a combustion process. In particular, OSSEs will be conducted to investigate synergistic information from GOSAT (and OCO-2) CO2, MOPITT (and IASI) CO and OMI NO2 retrievals in constraining sources of anthropogenic combustion at city, state, and regional spatiotemporal scales. These experiments will be carried out using ensemble-­‐based data assimilation (DA) system comprising of a regional air quality/weather model, WRF-­Chem, global climate/chemistry model, CAM-Chem, and a data assimilation software package, DART. The ensemble-based DA system, which mimics a numerical weather prediction with chemistry, provides a means to statistically estimate local sensitivities across modeled meteorological and chemical states (CO2, CO, NO2, and related species) and parameters (including surface fluxes) using the ensemble statistics derived from dynamical, physical, and chemical perturbations in the model. We take advantage of these sensitivities in fully exploiting the synergistic information provided by the enhancement ratios that are indicative of combustion characteristic for a given location sampled by these space-­based observations. Here, we introduce a two-­step approach in optimizing anthropogenic CO2. This includes: 1) analysis of atmospheric CO2 distribution using multi-­‐species DA, and 2) Bayesian synthesis time-independent inversion using the CO2 analysis as observational constraints. We evaluate the performance of this approach within an OSSE framework, where one realization of simulated atmosphere is assumed to be the ‘truth’. Synthetic observations are then derived from this atmosphere using sampling and error characteristics of the retrievals. The assimilation of these synthetic observations will be evaluated based on how well the analysis reproduce the ‘true’ anthropogenic CO2. Initial results will be presented comparing the relative contributions of different satellite retrievals in constraining anthropogenic CO2. We will also discuss appropriate sampling characteristics to this effect.",

            "abstract": "Forest inventories play an essential role in carbon monitoring and REDD+, however they provide a sparse picture of the carbon cycle at a regional scale. Terrestrial Biosphere Models (TBMs) provide a complete picture of the carbon cycle, but efforts at combining inventory data with models have focused primarily on model calibration and purely model-based regional-scale carbon estimation, which ignore observed disturbances, management, and spatiotemporal variability in forest. Our approach is based on assimilating inventory observations in a size- and age-structured model, the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2). Assumptions of large homogenous areas in ecological models result in loss of details that hinder incorporation of observations. We address how to assimilate inventory data with model predictions in a practical way that is readily extensible to the simultaneous fusion of remote sensing and eddy covariance along with inventories.\nWe updated ED2 predictions on forest growth with Forest Inventory and Analysis program (FIA) data. Data assimilation method was the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) as implemented in Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) workflow. The study area is a 1° by 1° grid with the Willow Creek Ameriflux tower in Wisconsin at center. ED2 groups individual trees in cohorts so it captures the landscape-scale heterogeneity. Although this approach speeds up computations, it is not practical to estimate each FIA plot within a chosen area. We classified and averaged data for different plots according to their biomass based on number and size of trees within a plot, focusing on biomass changes over a measurement period. We separately calculated the average diameter at breast height (dbh) and stem density for plants over 5 cm for measured and modeled plots within a biomass class for different Plant Functional Types (PFTs).\nThe results showed EAKF successfully adjusting the predicted changes in biomass according to observations. Variation in stem density and dbh within the same biomass class was low for plots with mid to high biomass and thus the state estimates fit better with all observed values within that biomass class, while plots with low biomass show high variation. Therefore applying a single correction factor for all plots did not match the updated plots with the observed plots.",

            "abstract": "Models that faithfully represent spatially-integrated hydrologic transport through the critical zone at sub-watershed scales are essential building blocks for large-scale models of land use and climate controls on non-point source contaminant delivery. A particular challenge facing these models is the need to represent the delay between inputs of soluble contaminants (such as nitrate) at the field scale, and the solute load that appears in streams. Recent advances in the theory of time-variable transit time distributions (e.g. Botter et al., GRL 38(L11403), 2011) have provided a rigorous framework for representing conservative solute transport and its coupling to hydrologic variability and partitioning.\nHere I will present a reformulation of this framework that offers several distinct advantages over existing formulations: 1) the derivation of the governing conservation equation is simple and intuitive, 2) the closure relations are expressed in a convenient and physically meaningful way as probability distributions\nΩ(\nS\nT\n)\nover the storage ranked by age\nS\nT\n, and 3) changes in transport behavior determined by storage-dependent dilution and flow-path dynamics (as distinct from those due only to changes in the rates and partitioning of water flux) are completely encapsulated by these probability distributions.\nThe framework has been implemented to model to the rich dataset of long-term stream and precipitation chloride from the Plynlimon watershed in Wales, UK. With suitable choices for the functional form of the closure relationships, only a small number of free parameters are required to reproduce the observed chloride dynamics as well as previous models with many more parameters, including reproducing the observed fractal 1/f filtering of the streamflow chloride variability. The modeled transport dynamics are sensitive to the input precipitation variability and water balance partitioning to evapotranspiration. Apparent storage-dependent age-sampling suggests that the model can account for shifts in flow pathways across high and low flows. This approach suggests a path forward for catchment-scale coupled flow and transport modeling.",

            "abstract": "Conversion from grassland to woody dominated communities has been observed globally. In recent decades, this pattern has been observed in coastal communities along the mid-Atlantic U.S. In coastal environments, a suite of biotic and abiotic factors interact as filters to determine plant community structure and distribution. Microclimatic conditions: soil and air temperature, soil moisture and salinity, and light attenuation under grass cover were measured across a grassland-woody encroachment gradient on a Virginia barrier island; to identify the primary factors that mediate this change. Woody establishment was associated with moderately dense (2200 shoots/m2) grass cover, but reduced at high (> 6200 shoots/ m2) and low (< 1250 shoots/ m2) densities. Moderately dense grass cover reduced light attenuation (82.50 % reduction) to sufficiently reduce soil temperature thereby limiting soil moisture evaporation. However, high grass density reduced light attenuation (98.7 % reduction) enough to inhibit establishment of woody species; whereas low grass density attenuated much less light (48.7 % reduction) which allowed for greater soil moisture evaporation. Soil salinity was dynamic as rainfall, tidal inundation, and sea spray produce spatiotemporal variation throughout the barrier island landscape. The importance of light and temperature were compounded as they also indirectly affect soil salinity via their affects on soil moisture. Determining how these biotic and abiotic factors relate to sea level rise and climate change will improve understanding coastal community response as global changes proceed. Understanding how community shifts affect ecosystem function and their potential to affect adjacent systems will also improve predictive ability of coastal ecosystem responses.",

            "abstract": "Changes in arctic tundra vegetation have the potential to alter the regional carbon (C) budget, with feedback implications for global climate. A number of studies have documented both widespread increases in productivity as well as shifts in the dominant vegetation. In particular, shrubs have been replacing other vegetation, such as graminoids, in response to changes in their environment. Shrub expansion is thought to be facilitated by exposure of mineral soil and increased nutrient availability, which are often associated with disturbance. Such disturbances can be naturally occurring, typically associated with permafrost degradation or with direct anthropogenic causes such as infrastructure development. Mechanical disturbance associated with human development is not uncommon in tundra and will likely become more frequent as warming makes the Arctic more hospitable for resource extraction and other human activities. As such, this type of disturbance will become an increasingly important component of tundra C balance. Both increased productivity and shrub expansion have clear impacts on ecosystem C cycling through increased C uptake and aboveground (AG) storage. What is less clear, however, are the concurrent changes in belowground (BG) C storage. Here we inventoried AG and BG C stocks in disturbed and undisturbed tundra ecosystems to determine the effects of disturbance on tundra C balance.\nWe measured differences in plant functional type, AG and BG biomass, soil C, and specific leaf area (SLA) for the dominant shrub (Salix) in 2 tundra ecosystems in northern Siberia—an undisturbed moist acidic tundra and an adjacent ecosystem that was used as a road ~50 years ago. Deciduous shrubs and grasses dominated both ecosystems, but biomass for both functional types was higher in the disturbed area. SLA was also higher inside the disturbance. Conversely, nonvascular plants and evergreen shrubs were less abundant in the disturbed area. BG plant biomass was substantially greater than AG biomass. On average, soil C pool in organic and mineral soils was higher in the disturbed areas. Our results illustrate changes in ecosystem structure and function associated with disturbance that may become increasingly important with continued climate warming and subsequent human activity in the Arctic.",

This study utilizes the regionalized version of GCAM for the U.S. with 50-state. GCAM-USA includes a detailed representation of water demands and tracks them at multiple spatial scales and annual scale. A spatial and temporal disaggregation approach is developed to project the annual regional water demand simulations into a daily time step and 1/8o spatial resolution for input to CLM, which has been coupled to a river routing model and generic water management model applicable globally at 1/2o resolution and regionally at 1/8o resolution. The coupled modeling framework demonstrated reasonable ability to simulate the historical flow regulation and water supply over the continental U.S.\nThe coupled modeling framework has been used to investigate: 1) Which water use sector (agriculture or energy) and subbasins in the conterminous U.S. will experience water deficits in future decades; 2) What are the drivers for the deficit (i.e., water availability, water demands, or both); 3) Will climate mitigation policies alleviate or exacerbate the situation; and lastly 4) How will the frequency , severity, and spatial extent of water deficits (hot spots) evolve under a non-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) in which conventional fossil-fueled technologies prevail versus a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) in which the carbon price causes a shift toward renewables and expansion of bioenergy productions. Results show that irrigation will face greater water deficit overall except in the northeastern U.S. Water deficit is greatest in the western U.S. except the Pacific Northwest. Human footprints on the regulated flows are most pronounced over the Rio Grande, Colorado, Great Lake, Great, and Missouri basins. Overall, total water deficit in term of both total volume and land area are projected to increase in the future under both RCPs.",

            "abstract": "The IRI based Real Time Assimilative Mapping (IRTAM) implements a novel assimilation approach that fuses climatology descriptions of IRI with real time data from the Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory (GIRO). At its current stage of development, IRTAM is an ionospheric weather now-casting model that improves the classic climatology, on average, more than twofold. The IRTAM is able to reproduce major effects that are caused by various events of both solar and terrestrial origin.\nNext step in further IRTAM development is directed towards its forecasting capability. We would like to know how temporal harmonics of the IRTAM specification of foF2/hmF2 are affected during disturbed conditions. Can we find patterns in their behavior and relate them to particular geomagnetic and solar activity indices? Can we forecast ionospheric conditions using previously observed patterns of behavior? To answer these questions we first investigate known storm events during the latest solar cycle. We calculate IRTAM global foF2/hmF2 expansion maps to look for hidden associations of the underlying map constituents to identify those responsible for particular features in foF2/hmF2 global behavior. This effort will result in a classification catalog of the feature patterns corresponding to these known events. We will compare these patterns to the IRI storm-time foF2 timelines. We expect such analysis to reveal various categories of events and to guide our further efforts towards a forecasting IRTAM.",

            "abstract": "Banding along the lower flanks of Mount Sharp has generally been interpreted to indicate stratigraphy within the mound that dips gently outward from it. Many of these bands define prominent terraces that can be traced nearly to closure around the mound, potentially providing chronostratigraphic markers. However, comparing orbital imagery and digital elevation models with ground-based views from Curiosity’s Mastcam suggests much of the banding might indicate buttress unconformities of now-largely-deflated plains units and/or paleolake strandlines that may not extend into the subsurface. Resistant horizons that parallel the upper surface of the mound can be identified in several erosional pits and along flanks of many of the butte “foothills” of Mt Sharp. These surfaces suggest that Mt Sharp was emplaced as a mound that may have been a few percent larger than the modern remnant, but that likely never extended across Gale crater and over the surrounding highland terrains.\nOther geomorphic surfaces – e.g., the fan-shaped feature at the mouth of the science target canyon – suggest paleo stratigraphic surfaces that dip outward at an angle steeper than the banding. The banding continues across these resistant horizons and other geomorphic surfaces without interruption, supporting the inference that it is overprinted onto dipping stratigraphy within Mt Sharp. Previously, we have identified at least three lake levels associated with major valley network fans/deltas debouching into Gale through the crater’s rim. It may be possible to correlate these with specific bands or terraces along the outer margin of Mount Sharp, enabling volume estimates and relative timing of lake levels within the crater to be addressed.",

            "abstract": "The external skeleton of mollusc bivalves, the shell, can furnish a recording of the environmental changes to which the organisms and population are exposed during their lives. The bivalve’s growth is subjected to the thermocline variability; which itself is affected by environmental and climatic events.\nA highly variable environment such as the Humboldt current system (HCS) requires tools capable of recording its variations over a wide range of periodicities. Upwelling, Coastal trapped waves (CTWs), El Niño Southern Oscillation, and Pacific decadal oscillation events contribute to this environmental and climatic variability. The thermocline depth is modified by these different events at their own time-scales (respectively, daily to weekly, intraseasonally, interseasonally to interannually, and on a decadal scale). The thermocline variation translates into changes in Sea surface temperature (SST) and in the qualitative and quantitative productivity of phytoplankton. These two environmental factors are critical to bivalve growth.\nThe sclerochronological (increment width) and sclerochemical (δ18O and δ13C) study consisted on the analysis of the Chilean bivalve Eurhomalea rufa, collected in 2005, as a recorder of the environmental HCS variability. The calibration step identified daily, monthly, and annual marks in the growth patterns of E. rufa. The results confirmed that the thermocline variability mainly drives the bivalve’s activity and led to the establishment of a paleotemperature equation. Moreover, periodogram and wavelet analyses exposed the respective impacts of each environmental event from daily to interannual periodicities. In particular, the growth pattern of E. rufa follows SST variability at an intraseasonal periodicity (~ 60 days) which is remotely induced by CTWs. CTWs are generated by Kelvin oceanic waves, which are formed primarily by eastward equatorial Pacific winds (e.g. Shaffer et al. 1997; Montecino and Lange 2009).\nSclerochronological studies on HCS bivalve shells can provide access to different periodicities, from daily to interannual. Studying shells of modern specimens can thus provide important information on bivalve growth parameters as well as on the variations and timescales of the surrounding environment such as SST and productivity.",

            "abstract": "We apply a suite of analysis methods, including statistical distribution and correlation, empirical orthogonal function (EOF), linear inverse modeling (LIM), and historical modeling using regional air quality and global chemistry-climate models, to analyze surface ozone (since 1980) and PM2.5 (since 2000) measurements from EPA observation networks. The overarching goal is to understand how regional climate and weather systems affect air quality trends and extreme events. Previous studies documented high or geographically specific ozone episodes and identified contributions from anticyclone, transport, or sub-decadal to decadal time scale patterns pertinent to the events. Here, an ensemble analysis of all events from single day to multi-day episodes in the past three decades places all episodes into a continuum of time and geospatial coordinates. Inter-annual patterns linked to source concentrations and seasonal transport are evident, but anomalies such as unseasonable and persistent anticyclones to winter events over snow cover can also be identified. Overlapping events between ozone and temperature extremes are identified. They tend to occur in eastern and western coast regions with significant local variability. The occurrence frequency of overlapping events decreased from 1980s to 2000s. PM2.5 extreme showed more sensitivity to extreme temperature than drought index. When being divided by two periods (2000-2004 and 2005-2009), the second period had more extreme PM events at lower temperature in winter time. An EOF analysis was conducted to examine how regional and hemispheric climate variability affects the ozone extreme events. A question explored here is how well EOF analysis that links ozone concentrations to climate variables explains the temporal and geospatial variability of extreme ozone events (days and episodes >= 75 ppbv). The seasonal change in controlling weather systems plays a key role in how regional climate affects air quality. We also show the feasibility of long-range (1 month) statistical forecasting of PM2.5. Lastly, regional and global model simulations were investigated to understand the mechanisms and identify required model improvements for simulating air quality extremes and trends.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary record of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway is characterized by periods of enhanced organic carbon burial known as Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs). Compared to older OAEs, the last Cretaceous OAE, the Coniacian-Santonian OAE 3 (~86 Ma), is more enigmatic and its driving mechanisms less well understood. In contrast to the nearly global OAE 2, OAE 3 was geographically limited to restricted basins and shallow seaways. Due to significant organic carbon burial, OAEs are traditionally identified by large, rapid positive carbon isotope excursions, whereas OAE 3 is characterized by a relatively muted carbonate positive carbon “plateau” that persists for ~3 myrs, which suggests significantly different carbon burial processes or paleoceanographic conditions.\nHere we present new high-resolution paired organic-inorganic carbon isotope records from the Niobrara Formation recovered in the USGS #1 Portland core from Cañon City Basin, Colorado. At the onset of OAE 3, there is a distinct decoupling of the organic and inorganic carbon isotope records. δ13Ccarb exhibits an abrupt ~1‰ positive isotope excursion at the onset of carbon burial superimposed on a larger ~2‰ isotope trend. Coeval with this shift, is a ~3‰ negative δ13Corg excursion. These results indicate that during OAE 3 in the Western Interior Seaway, while significant organic carbon was being buried, organic carbon was depleted in 13C. The carbon isotope records will be compared to records of organic carbon, C:N ratios, and redox sensitive metals such as U and Mo to evaluate how carbon cycling changed during OAE 3.",

            "abstract": "Urban agriculture provides a potential contribution towards more sustainable food production and mitigating some of the human impacts that accompany volatility in regional and global food supply. When considering the capacity of urban landscapes to produce food products, the impact of urban water demand required for food production in cities is often neglected. Urban agricultural studies also tend to be undertaken at broad spatial scales, overlooking the heterogeneity of urban form that exerts an extreme influence on the urban energy balance. As a result, urban planning and management practitioners require, but often do not have, spatially explicit and detailed information to support informed urban agricultural policy, especially as it relates to potential conflicts with sustainability goals targeting water-use. In this research we introduce a new model, CityCrop, a hybrid evapotranspiration-plant growth model that incorporates detailed digital representations of the urban surface and biophysical impacts of the built environment and urban trees to account for the daily variations in net surface radiation. The model enables very fine-scale (sub-meter) estimates of water footprints of potential urban agricultural production. Results of the model are demonstrated for an area in the City of Vancouver, Canada and compared to aspatial model estimates, demonstrating the unique considerations and sensitivities for current and future water footprints of urban agriculture and the implications for urban water planning and policy.",

            "abstract": "The application of laser technologies for high spatial resolution dating has proven to be an important advancement in (U-Th)/He thermochronology. Excimer laser microprobes have been used to successfully date high U+Th minerals and are an especially promising way to determine the distribution of (U-Th)/He zircon ages in detrital sedimentary samples. We have also found that another detrital mineral, titanite, may be amenable to this method as well. While titanite contains lower concentrations of parent isotopes than zircon, and consequently less radiogenic 4He, its typically larger grain size allows for these characteristics to be mitigated by the use of larger laser beam diameters during the ablation process. With the integrated use of ICPMS, an established method for U/Pb geochronology, this phase of the laser microprobe (U-Th)/He technique can be modified slightly to enable (U-Th)/He and U/Pb ‘double’ dating of detrital samples. Here we present a proof of concept study demonstrating the viability of integrated laser microprobe (U-Th)/He and U/Pb through dating Oligocene Fish Canyon tuff titanite and zircon from Colorado. Our use of a well characterized sample with established (U-Th)/He and U/Pb dates allows us to fully evaluate the utility of this technique. By selecting medium- to fine-grained crystals we are able to simulate a realistic, uni-modal detrital sample. Using our modified laser microprobe approach, we are able to reproduce the expected age modes with an analytical imprecision roughly twice that of more established methods, a difference that has little practical effect on geologic interpretations. Additionally, we believe that the technique could prove a viable method for double dating detrital rutile and apatite, so long as characteristically lower U+Th concentrations in these minerals are balanced by appropriately scaled ablation pits in an aliquot unbiased by the need for larger detrital grains. Ultimately, integrated laser microprobe U/Pb and (U-Th)/He dating of multiple detrital accessory minerals can be an exceptionally valuable tool for identifying sedimentary provenance and evaluating the exhumation history of a source region.",

            "abstract": "Extreme events such as tropical storms and typhoons are often the determining factor for the extreme values of wind, wave and water level conditions. The storm track, its propagation speed, the air pressure drop and the wind speed intensity of a typhoon determine the maximum occurring wave heights, water levels and currents. The stochastic behaviour of typhoons and tropical storms, however, lead to uncertainty in the extreme value analysis, because a slight variation of the typhoon track, propagation speed or wind speed intensity can have a significant impact on these local extreme hydrodynamic conditions.\nTo determine the significance of the stochastic behaviour of typhoons a model assessment is performed comparing standard extreme value analysis values of measured water levels (e.g. values of 1/10, 1/50, and 1/100 year return periods) against model results of artificial typhoons. In the model assessment, making use of Delft3D, various artificial typhoons are modelled in which the typhoon tracks, propagation speeds and wind speed intensities are varied within realistic ranges (based on observed historical typhoons). The study focusses on the Pearl River estuary (China) where typically about 5 to 10 tropical storms or typhoons are observed every year. Once every few years an extreme typhoon hits the area. By quantifying the potential impact of artificial typhoons the uncertainty in the extreme water level values in such a typhoon prone area are better assessed.\nThe model is validated simulating several historic typhoons. Subsequently the typhoons tracks, their propagation speeds and wind speed intensities are varied. The extreme water level values (extreme surge height + mean high water value) that follow from the artificial typhoon modelling are compared against values from a standard extreme value analysis, making use of the central limit theorem for the extreme values in a sample. A Peaks over Threshold approach is applied and the extremes are fitted and extrapolated according to a Generalized Pareto Distribution. One of our main conclusions is that while the peak surge heights and related total water levels resulting from the historical and synthetic typhoon simulations can exceed the once per 100 year extreme total water level estimates, they are generally within the 95% confidence interval of the estimate.",

Predicting the weather and climate in large cities is remains a challenge because there are diverse processes and factors that determine or influence atmospheric condition at various time and space scales. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of connection between local climate (influenced by urbanization) and those due to larger scales. The weather and microclimate over Santarém city in Amazonia is poor studied and monitored. The application of meteorological models, which representing the diverse atmospheric processes at the various scales, is essential, as e.g. WRF EMS model. The addition of spatial scale data is needed for validation of these models over cities. In this paper, we describe the application of the WRF EMS model (Weather Research and Forecasting) to represent the urban-scale atmospheric conditions (1km resolution) over the Santarem city. The model was validated against observed 2 meter air temperature obtained from several points and spatial rainfall over urbanized zones of Santarém. Thermal conditions and gradients of temperature over forested and non-forested zones were clear represented by the model. The WRF model reproduces well rainfall patterns around the urban area and Tapajós river-city contacts. The main results for this model test was the Improvements in the representation of the types of land cover-Land change from the mosaics structures on the city domain, what permit all errors/bias are reduced.",

            "abstract": "CloudSat (CS) heralded a new era of profiling the planet's cloud systems and storms with its launch in 2006. This satellite flies the first 94 GHz spaceborne cloud profiling radar and the data collected has provided a unique perspective on Earth's cloudiness and processes that affect clouds. While passes of the nadir-pointing CPR antenna occur infrequently over tropical cyclones (TCs), they happen enough to provide a detailed compilation of the inner structure of clouds and precipitation of these complex storm systems. Over 8,000 vertical profiles of TCs have been collected during the period June 2006 through June 2014 and observations continue as CS flies in daylight only mode. Each unique overpass profiled by CS has been compiled with corresponding A-Train sensors, model data and storm specific best track information.\nWith the volume of data collected, it is possible to composite TC structure information with respect to various environmental parameters that are known to have a controlling influence on storms. To illustrate this characteristic of the data, we show composites of the vertical structure of TCs as a function of environmental wind shear. Observations of wind shear at varying levels (for example 200-850 mb) and TC composites relative to the direction of the larger scale shear will be examined and discussed in detail.",

However, comparison of zircon U-Pb age spectra of soil and bedrock (Ayers and Katsiaficas, unpublished data) suggests that there is a small but significant exotic (externally derived) zircon component. Potential sources of exotic zircon include loess and alluvial sediments. In western Tennessee the Roxana Silt was deposited 38-53 ka and the Peoria Loess 18-25 ka. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology is a direct and effective way to test the possibility of loess as a contributor to the source material of the soil. According to Aleinikoff et al. (2008), loess from Colorado and Nebraska have young detrital zircon age peaks at ~34Ma. If this is also true for the loess in Tennessee, it may explain the ~33 Ma age peak found in one of the three studied soil samples. To identify the source of the exotic zircon found in middle TN soils, zircon age spectra will be measured for Roxana Silt, Peoria Loess, and alluvial sediments from the Harpeth and Cumberland Rivers. The loess samples were collected near Memphis, TN, while the alluvial sediments were collected near the soil sample sites.",

Sediments recovered from IODP Site U1396 (16.51°N, 62.45°W) contain a 140 m sequence of hemiplegic sediment and intercalated tephra related to the evolution of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. Shipboard measurements of the NRM demagnetized at 20mT documented 17 polarity reversals dating back ~4.5Myrs with magnetic susceptibility (MS) efficient at identifying the visible tephra. These initial results suggested Site U1396 presents a rare, low-latitude, sedimentary magnetic record stretching back into the Gilbert chron. After developing a composite depth scale for the site, we sampled the continuous splice with u-channels to improve the 2.5cm shipboard resolution. Centimeter scale u-channel measurements of MS, NRM AF demagnetized in 12 steps between 20-80mT, and ARM were accompanied by hysteresis measurements of discrete samples to assess lithologic variability, establish the magnetic carriers and quality of the geomagnetic signal, refine the shipboard magneto-stratigraphic reversal record, and derive an estimate for relative paleointensity (RPI). Magnetic mineralogy is dominated by PSD-MD size ferrimagnetic minerals and MS efficiently discriminates sub-cm scale tephra that can drive lithologic variances in the NRM from the carbonate dominated hemipelagic sediment. Maximum angular deviation (MAD) values range from < 1° to > 40° in volcanogenic deposits, though 5-10° are more representative of hemipelagic intervals whose average values are lower in the Pliocene than the Pleistocene. Inclination varies around GAD predictions for both polarities which alongside azimuthally orientated declination establishes the refined reversal based age model. Pliocene sedimentation rates (~4 cm ky-1) are twice that of the Pleistocene and MS reveals a greater Pliocene eruption frequency potentially identifying a behavioral change in the volcanic history of the arc. The NRM was normalized by ARM and MS to generate estimations of RPI. Comparison to ODP Site 983 shows preservation of similar directional and intensity features through the B/M boundary while lower Pliocene MAD values and the accompaniment of older reversals with RPI lows reinforces our geomagnetic interpretation back into the Gilbert.",

It is essential that a careful validation of its uncertainties is performed on a global and continuous basis. One approach is the direct comparison of this product with ground measurements but that approach presents several issues related to scale, the episodic nature of ground measurements and the global representativeness. An alternative is to compare the surface reflectance product to reference reflectance determined from Top of atmosphere reflectance corrected using accurate radiative transfer code and very detailed measurements of the atmosphere obtained over the AERONET sites (Vermote and al, 2014, RSE) which allows to test for a large range of aerosol characteristics; formers being important inputs for atmospheric corrections. However, the application of this method necessitates the definition of a very detailed protocol for the use of AERONET data especially as far as size distribution and absorption are concerned, so that alternative validation methods or protocols could be compared. This paper describes the protocol we have been working on based on our experience with the AERONET data and its application to the MODIS and VIIRS record.",

            "abstract": "There has always been a strong perception within the geoscience community that a capstone field course was the pinnacle of an undergraduate geoscience degree. Such a course draws from the student’s accumulated knowledge base, using information from multiple sub-disciplines to solve “real-world” problems. Since 2006, there has been a 92% increase in students attending field camps (Status of the Geoscience Workforce 2014 – AGI). But, the number of field camps has significantly declined. In 1995, 35% of geoscience departments offered a summer field course but by 2006 that number had dropped to 15% (Status Report on Geoscience Summer Field Camps – AGI) and since 2009, the number of field camps listed in the Geology.com directory has dropped from 100 to about 75. This decline is despite the fact that 88% of industry professionals believe fieldwork should “be an integral and required part of undergraduate programs” (Petcovic, et al., 2014).\nIn 2012, in order to meet the growing needs of industry and better prepare our students, Texas A&M University-Kingsville developed an in-house, unique set of field courses that expand the limits of the classroom. We have two required courses. One is similar to a traditional field camp except that it contains a writing intensive component. The six-credit course runs for seven weeks. Prior to camp, students are required to write an introduction (geologic history section) on the study area. We spend two weeks in the field, mapping daily (Big Bend National Park), and then return to Kingsville. Students then have two weeks to finish a fully referenced paper, including their edited introduction, methods, observations, interpretations, discussion and conclusions and once complete, they begin the introduction for the next area. This is another two-week field session, in central Texas. After this, we return the first paper which has been edited for content by geoscience faculty and for grammar by an English instructor. Students spend the next few days correcting edits and turn in a polished, final draft. They use edits and suggestions from this first paper to complete the second paper. Our second field course or “professional development” course occurs between the fall and spring semesters and is two credits, co-taught by industry leaders, and also writing intensive.",

            "abstract": "One of the most widespread habitable environments on Earth lurks just under our feet. Soils, which are created by precipitation-induced chemical weathering of rocks and sediments, provide abundant geochemical sources of energy for microbes, and form even under water-limited or snow-dominated climates. The mineralogy of soils is directly related to climatic and environmental conditions. Typical neutral, well-drained soils are dominated by phyllosilicates produced through hydrolysis by carbonic acid, but the additional presence of sulfates, oxides, reduced iron, and carbonates can indicate other conditions, including variations in water saturation, redox state, and pH. The high clay content of soils enhances preservation, and reducing soils, like those formed in wetlands, can preserve high concentrations of organics in the form of coal precursors.\nOn Mars, deposits with mineralogies consistent with paleosols are observed in several locations, but are best exemplified by clay-bearing deposits on the plateau surrounding Mawrth Vallis. Widespread smectites at Mawrth are consistent with regional paleosols formed under a temperate climate, and detections of leached Al-rich minerals, acid sulfates, and reduced iron-bearing phases are consistent with localized modification of these soils by fluctuating ground water tables. Together, this suggests a wetlands-like surface environment with diverse chemical gradients providing many energy pathways for life and locally high preservation potential.\nWhile sites like Mawrth could be excellent targets for organics and biosignatures on Mars, one limitation of such dispersed sites is that finding high concentrations of organics can be challenging. An alternative would be to utilize deltas and other fluvial deposits as a geological filter. Deltas concentrate the often organic-rich clay size fraction of detrital sediments in well-defined locations. On Earth, the majority of deltaic organics and clays are sourced from soils upstream, and have been shown to host some of the oldest known non-marine organics. Thus, while deltas can be a powerful tool for searching for organics and biosignatures, their utility is greatly enhanced if the sediment source region also exhibits clear evidence for habitability, in the form of soils or other environmental indicators.",

The accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere resulting from the indiscriminate distribution of human populations and urban activities with the unsustainable consumption of natural resources contributes to global environmental change especially in coastal cities like Lagos. Carbon stocks and sequestration by urban trees are increasingly recognized to play significant roles for mitigating climate change. This paper focuses on the estimation of carbon stock and sequestration through biomass estimation and quantification in Ikeja GRA, Lagos. Ikeja possesses a characteristic feature as a microcosm of Lagos due to the wide range of land uses. A canopy assessment of tree population was carried out using itree canopy software. A GPS survey was used to collect an inventory of all trees showing their location, spatial distribution and other attributes. The analysis of the carbon storage and sequestration potential of both actual and potential tree planting sites involved biomass estimations from tree allometry equations. Trees were identified at species level and measurements of their dendrometric values were recorded and integrated into the GIS database to estimate biomass of trees and carbon storage. The trees in the study area were estimated to have a biomass of 441.9 mg and carbon storage of 221.395 kg/tree. By considering the potential tree planting sites the estimated carbon stored increased to 11,352.73 kg. Carbon sequestration value in the study area was found to be 1.6790 tonnes for the existing trees and 40.707 tonnes for the potential tree planting sites (PTPS). The estimation of carbon storage and sequestration values of trees are important incentives for carbon accounting/footprints and monitoring of climate change mitigation which has implications for evaluation and monitoring of urban ecosystem.",

In Mewat District (Haryana, India), groundwater salinity has rendered much of the accessible supply unfit for human consumption or agriculture. Historically, this closed basin retained fresh pockets of water at the foothills of the Aravalli Hills, where monsoonal precipitation runoff from the mountains was recharged through infiltration or facilitated by man-made structures. To date, an increasing number of pumps supply the region with fresh water for consumption and agriculture leading to shrinking the freshwater zone at an accelerated pace. The potential for increased human consumption corroborated with the effects of climate change bring uncertainty about the future of water security for the Mewat communities, most of them critically bound to the existence of local water. This study addresses the sustainability of the freshwater supply under a range of land interventions and climate scenarios, using a 2-D groundwater flow and transport model.

            "abstract": "In mountain watersheds of the western US, fire and other disturbances interact with vegetation dynamics and hydrology to affect ecosystem structure and function. It is necessary to couple projections of hydrological processes in a changing climate with projections of fire disturbances, but to our knowledge none of the watershed-scale ecosystem models that have disturbance modules have explicit hydrological routing. This is because it is difficult to find common currency between variables associated with spatially explicit hydrology and those associated with fire spread and fire severity. We have developed WMFire, a stochastic raster-based model of fire spread that integrates fire with the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), a spatially distributed model of climate-water-carbon interactions that projects the effects of climatic change on mountain watersheds. We resolve mismatches between the two model systems by aggregating the dynamics of fire spread into probabilities, whereby the probability a fire spreads into a neighboring cell increases with the fuel load and moisture input from the hydrological model, and the probability further increases if the direction of spread is uphill and in line with the prevailing wind direction. In this manner WMFire is expected to replicate patterns of spread and fire regimes, not the propagation of individual fire events. Patterns of fire spread and effects simulated by WMFire are returned to RHESSys, modifying carbon source-sink dynamics and hydrological routing. Model evaluation entails a quantitative procedure to assess the agreement between simulated fire-regime properties and observations. Simulations to date have focused on historical projections to evaluate how well the coupled model replicates fire regimes of the past half-century on two watersheds: one in the HJ Andrews experimental forest in Oregon, USA, and another the watershed supplying water to Santa Fe, NM, USA. In extensive model evaluation we match the level of abstraction of fire spread to that of the hydrological model, thereby identifying and reducing sources of uncertainty both in the fire spread model and in the coupling of the fire spread model with the hydrological model.",

            "abstract": "Understanding water sources, use, and availability in Earth’s arid and semiarid lands is fundamental to understanding and forecasting dryland ecosystem function. While it is accepted that drylands can obtain water from sources other than precipitation (e.g., from dew), little is known about how liquid water supplied to dryland soils via water vapor adsorption (WVA) helps to regulate dryland communities and their activity. WVA – the adsorption of water vapor and subsequent formation of liquid water within soil – occurs at times when the relative humidity in the soil atmosphere is lower than the relative humidity of the overlying air. Surprisingly little research has been focused on WVA, though environmental conditions are such that this phenomenon is likely to occur quite regularly in dryland regions throughout the world. Here we used an observational study in a semiarid grassland and a series of laboratory experiments to explore the role of WVA in providing soil moisture and regulating soil microbial activity (assessed as CO2 efflux rates). Through the introduction of 18O liquid water into the atmosphere of a closed system, we were able to trace the movement of water from the atmosphere to the soil via WVA under a range of temperature conditions. Both in the field setting and in the laboratory, elevated rates of soil respiration were observed with WVA-induced increases in soil moisture. Taken together, these results indicate that vapor adsorption is occurring under a variety of common conditions and provide compelling evidence that this water source may strongly influence the activity of soil microorganisms, including fundamental aspects of the soil carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "The estimated magnitude of the carbon (C) stocks contained in the first meter of US coastal wetland soils represents ~10% of the entire C stock in US soils (4 vs. 52 Pg, respectively). Because this stock extends to several meters below the surface for many coastal wetlands, it becomes paramount to understand the fate of C under ecosystem shifts, varying natural environmental constraints, and changing land use. In this project we analyze total hydrolysable carbohydrates, amino acids, phenols and stable isotopic data (δ13C) at two study sites located on the Texas coastline to investigate chemical compositions and the stage of decomposition in mangrove and marsh grass dominated wetlands. Carbohydrates are used as specific decomposition indicators of the polysaccharide component of wetland plants, whereas amino acids are used to identify the contribution of microbial biomass, and acid/aldehyde ratios of syringyl (S) and vanillyl (V) phenols (Ac/AlS,V) follow the decomposition of lignin. Preliminary results show carbohydrates account for 30-50 % of organic carbon in plant litter and surface sediments at both sites. Sharp declines of carbohydrate yields with depth occur parallel to increasing Ac/AlS,V ratios indicating substantial decomposition of both the polysaccharide and lignin components of litter detritus. Ecological differences (between marsh grass and mangrove dominated wetlands) are discussed to better constrain the role of litter biochemistry and ecological shifts on C preservation in these anoxic environments.",

            "abstract": "Sandbars in sand-bedded rivers of the Central U.S. are highly dynamic, with substantive changes occurring across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. River hydrology is the primary driver of channel patterns and morphodynamics in these systems, and characterization of sandbar responses to varying flow regime allows for a better understanding of landscape-scale ecology for sandbar-dependent species. We are developing models of sandbar response to river hydrology to be used initially in a metapopulation ecological model of the endangered Interior Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) for 11 different predominantly regulated rivers of the Central U.S. plains. The model is being developed to simulate long term (>30 years) species population dynamics. Because of the large temporal and spatial scope of this effort, we are using an empirical approach to characterize dynamics of sandbar location and extent within the modeling domain in place of more intensive physical models. We developed a dataset of in-channel land cover classifications spanning from 1982 to 2011 for the modeling domain using surface reflectance data from select images of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) Climate Data Record (CDR). Additionally, we segmented all rivers into lengths with approximately uniform discharge and compiled historic discharge data for each segment. We integrated these data to develop a long-term dataset of sandbar area, cover type, and prevailing discharge. We used residuals of regressions between sandbar area and discharge to normalize sandbar area to varying discharge. By comparing our sandbar area and vegetation cover dataset to historic discharge records, we characterize the types of hydrographs that form, erode, and recruit vegetation on sandbars in different river systems, and the rates at which these processes occur. Additionally, we use geomorphic covariates calculated from remote sensing data to begin to explore controls on spatial variation in sandbar morphodynamics.",

            "abstract": "Mountain glaciers serve as important paleoclimate records due to the direct physical link\nbetween glacier extent and climate. The high sensitivity of mountain glaciers to even small\nperturbations in the climate has the potential to provide very detailed records of regional\nglacier and climate histories. Recent progress in age determination techniques such as\nsurface exposure dating has greatly improved the temporal precision of glacial records.\nThe conversion of changes in glacier geometries to a climate signal, however, remains a\nsignificant challenge. A particular need exists for a versatile method easily applicable to\ndiverse regions and conditions around the globe. Because the equilibrium line altitude\n(ELA) provides a more explicit comparison of climate than properties such as glacier length\nor area, ELA methods lend themselves well to such a need, and allow for a more direct\ninvestigation of the primary drivers of mountain glaciations during specific events. Here we\npresent a new, robust ELA model for quantifying changes in climate directly from glacier\ngeometry. The model derives from a linear flow model based on Glen’s Flow law while fully\naccounting for glacier hypsometry. As a preliminary application, we combined our modeled\nELA reconstructions with a new 10Be chronology of late glacial culminations in Graubünden\nin the Swiss Alps. These glacier culminations occurred during the Egesen Stadial, which has\nbeen correlated to the Younger Dryas (YD) interval. Results for two related glacier systems\nin Graubünden reveal an ELA depression of 365-401 m (depending on the moraines\nchosen) during the Egesen stage/YD compared to the modern ELA. This agrees well both\nwith established estimates for ELA depressions in the region and an additional application\nperformed using our model and previously determined ages on the nearby Lagrev Glacier\n(a 370 m ELA depression). We then reconstruct the temperature and precipitation changes\nrequired to explain the ELA changes for these Swiss glacier systems. We will apply the\nmodel to other regions in order to further elucidate the variability and sensitivity in the\nclimate system during the YD, and provide insight into the primary drivers of those changes.",

In the process of dumping the source rock, organic matter is transformed into a complex of high-molecular compounds - precursors of oil and gas (kerogen). Entering of a source column for specific thermobaric conditions, triggers the formation of low molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds. Generation of sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons leads to the primary fluid migration within the source rock.\nFor the experiment were selected mainly siliceous-carbonate composition rocks from Domanic horizon South-Tatar arch. The main aim of experiment was heating the rocks in the pyrolyzer to temperatures which correspond katagenes stages. For monitoring changes in the morphology of the pore space X-ray microtomography method was used.\nAs a result, when was made a study of the composition of mineral and organic content of the rocks, as well as textural and structural features, have been identified that the majority of the rock samples within the selected collection are identical. However, characteristics such as organic content and texture of rocks are different. Thus, the experiment was divided into two parts: 1) the study of the influence of organic matter content on the morphology of the rock in the process of thermal effects; 2) study the effect of texture on the primary migration processes for the same values of organic matter. Also, an additional experiment was conducted to study the dynamics of changes in the structure of the pore space.\nAt each stage of the experiment morphology of altered rocks characterized by the formation of new pores and channels connecting the primary voids. However, it was noted that the samples with a relatively low content of the organic matter had less changes in pore space morphology, in contrast to rocks with a high organic content. At the second stage of the research also revealed that the conversion of the pore space at the expense of primary migration processes in rocks with different textures can be held in different ways.\nDuring the sequential heating significant changes in the structure of the pore space have occurred in the step from 260 ° C to 430 º C. This temperature range corresponds to the most intense stage of the formation of hydrocarbons.",

            "abstract": "Running simulations is an involved process taking many hours of computational time to complete. With the advent of cluster computing and parallel processing, problems may be solved in much less time compared to those run in serial. Specifically, NVIDIA released the parallel computing platform CUDA in 2007 giving researchers and programmers access to the GPU to solve generalized problems, and not those of just images.\nIn current research, code has previously been developed to study the interaction of the heliosphere and heavy atoms from the local interstellar medium.\nIonized species of hydrogen, helium and other heavy atoms are deflected by the heliosphere where as the neutral species are relatively unimpeded. Charge exchange of these neutral particles may occur between ionized species originating from the solar wind or other populations of pickup ions (PUI) modifying the shape and properties of the heliosphere, compared to one without neutrals. The details of the charge exchange interaction are element dependent and need to be investigated one by one. Current research has studied the interaction of local interstellar hydrogen with the heliosphere quite extensively with theory, simulations and modeling.\nSince hydrogen is the most abundant element care must be taken when coupling MHD equations with the charge exchange interactions. Simulation code has been developed to account for this dynamic problem and they have shown that the shape of the heliosphere is affected by this. Interstellar atoms heavier than hydrogen interacting with the heliosphere has been looked at as well, but not nearly with as much detail or sophisticated models as hydrogen. The heavy atom data collected by IBEX has in this sense been under-utilized by models.\nPreviously, the simulation was computed with the use of MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallelization. This approach provided a decrease in computational time. However, CUDA enables the programmer to take advantage of the computer's hardware allowing for more code/memory optimization. The results of this work demonstrate a respectable decrease in computation time of the CUDA code compared to the MPI code. In addition, the distribution, temperature, and direction of primary and secondary ions and neutrals were found for that of helium and oxygen in and around the heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Blue Nile, a major tributary of the Nile River, extensively incised the long-wavelength Ethiopian Plateau developed within the East African Rift System, exposing various rock formations ranging in age from Neoproterozoic to Recent. The 1.6 km deep Blue Nile Canyon, the only deep and extensive canyon in the greater Nile drainage basin, characterizes the plateau, which has an average elevation of 2.5 km. The time line of the plateau uplift is still not well understood, and has been highly contested, with some suggesting early (before 20 Ma) and others arguing late (after 10 Ma) rise of the plateau. A recent modeling of deep-mantle convection beneath the African continent showed that the Ethiopian Plateau started to rise rapidly around 10 Ma. Quantifying the incision history of the Ethiopian Plateau is critical in unraveling the causes and timing of plateau’s elevation gain.\nLow temperature thermochronology provides a rigorous analytical tool in determining the cooling history to reconstruct canyon incision. From apatite (U-Th)/He ages measured from Neoproterozoic basement rocks and Mesozoic sedimentary strata exposed along the valley wall of the Blue Nile canyon, we investigate rock cooling history of the Ethiopian Plateau induced by this canyon incision. Although our apatite He dates show strong data dispersion, both within and among samples and ranging from 58 to 460 Ma, these ages positively correlate with apatite effective uranium concentrations. Hence, this age dispersion is likely linked to changes in helium retention and diffusivity related to differential accumulation of radiation damage. Our inverse thermal model simulations determine the best-fit cooling history that shows the onset of major canyon incision after 30 Ma with regional exhumation accelerated after 15 Ma. These observations are also supported by our quantitative geomorphic data extracted from the Blue Nile tributaries that correlates with mantle tomography data.",

            "abstract": "We quantify the loss of radiation belt electrons into Earth’s atmosphere with measurements from the Radiation Belt Storm Probes – Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal plasma (RBSP-ECT) instrument suite onboard NASA’s Van Allen Probes mission. Understanding the relative importance of radiation belt enhancements and decreases relies on a quantitative assessment of the state of the belts. For instance, estimates of electron loss through precipitation into the atmosphere only become meaningful when compared to the total belt population. Previous studies used observations to quantify the total number of energetic electrons in the Van Allen belts. Baker et al. (2004) used measurements from the low altitude SAMPEX mission to estimate the radiation belt content, while Selesnick and Kanekal (2009) used high altitude NASA/Polar measurements. Our work extends these pioneering studies by taking advantage of measurements from RBSP-ECT, providing complete coverage of electron energy and pitch angle, near the magnetic equator, and with sufficiently high time cadence. We integrate the electrons measured by RBSP-ECT over energy and pitch angle throughout the belts every half orbit on each spacecraft to establish a quantitative estimate of the total radiation belt electron content (TRBEC) and its time variation. We identify a several week period in March 2013 during which TRBEC slowly decayed following an impulsive enhancement. Over that interval, electron phase space density profiles with L* are consistent with inward radial diffusion conditions, at all first and second invariants, with no indications of significant local acceleration or impulsive injections. From this slowly-evolving, quiet interval, we may thus constrain the total amount that was lost through precipitation to the atmosphere in the global system. In the absence of new sources, and assuming only the one sink in such a state, we effectively quantify the efficiency of the “drain” (precipitation loss to the atmosphere) by watching the TRBEC level decrease with time from the radiation belt electron reservoir. We compare this loss estimate with previous estimates and, finally, discuss the implications of this energetic electron precipitation on atmospheric chemistry.",

The seismicity is dominated by the area near Novy Kostel where earthquakes cluster along a narrow and steeply dipping focal zone of 8 km length that strikes about N-S in the depth range 7-11 km. Detailed seismic monitoring has been carried out by the WEBNET seismic network since 1992. During that period earthquake swarms with several mainshocks exceeding magnitude level ML 3 took place in 2000, 2008 and 2011. These swarms were characteristic by episodic character where the activity of individual episodes overlapped in time and space. Interestingly, the rate of activity of individual swarms increased with each subsequent swarm; the 2000 swarm being the slowest and the 2011 swarm the most rapid one. In 2014 the character of seismicity has changed from a swarm-like activity to a mainshock-aftershock activity. Already three mainshocks has occurred since May 2014; the ML 3.6 event of May 24, the ML 4.5 event of May 31 and the ML 3.5 event of August 3. All these events were followed by a short aftershock sequence of one to four days duration. All three events exceeded the following aftershocks by more than one magnitude level and none of these mainshocks were preceded by foreshocks, which differentiates this activity from the preceding swarm seismicity. Interestingly, the hypocenters of the mentioned earthquake swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences share a common fault zone and overlap significantly.\nWe present detailed analysis of precise hypocenter locations and statistical characteristics of the activity in order to find the origin of different behavior of seismic activity, which results in either earthquake swarms or mainshock-aftershock activity.",

If we seek to educate students in the fundamentals of environmental stewardship we must also put stewardship into practice as part of that education. The EES program is a semester length earth systems field program held on Hawai`i Island. In Hawai`i students gain first-hand experience with the interconnected solid earth, living earth, ocean and atmosphere. They also gain first-hand experience with the consequences of unsustainable resource use: marine resource depletion, deforestation and species loss, development v. conservation, fossil fuel v. alternative energy options. Yet as a travel-based field program the pursuit of these goals carries a clear environmental cost. Thus a core element of EES education is to run a carbon-neutral program. To achieve this, students quantify every aspect of the program’s carbon footprint. They decide which actions they must include as part of that footprint and learn how to monitor and calculate the resulting CO2 emissions. Students learn how to reduce emissions where possible, and offset emissions that cannot be eliminated. Working in partnership with island-based conservation organizations students engage in reforestation of degraded native forest landscapes. They model the carbon sequestration capacity of restored forest biomass and soil reservoirs. The outcome of this process has triple-bottom-line benefits: (1) native forest and endangered species habitat is restored, (2) carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and sequestered, and (3) students gain hands-on, minds-on experience with carbon-cycle science, ecosystem science, and with the ethical imperative of putting one’s knowledge into action.",

            "abstract": "The exchangeability of methane for carbon dioxide in gas hydrates opens the possibility of producing emission-neutral hydrocarbon energy. Recent field tests have shown that the production of natural gas from gas hydrates is feasible via injection of carbon dioxide into sandy, methane-hydrate-bearing sediment strata. Industrial-scale application of this method requires identification of thermo- and fluid-dynamic as well as kinetic controls on methane yield from and carbon dioxide retention within the reservoir. Extraction of gas via injection of carbon dioxide into the hydrate reservoir triggers a number of macroscopic effects, which are revealed for example by changes of the hydraulic conductivity and geomechanical stability. Thus far, due to analytical limitations, localized reactions and fluid-flow phenomena held responsible for these effects remain unresolved on the microscale (1 µm – 1 mm) and at near-natural reservoir conditions. We address this deficit by showing results from high-resolution, two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy mappings of an artificial hydrate reservoir during carbon dioxide injection under realistic reservoir conditions. The experiments allow us to resolve hydrate conversion rate and efficiency as well as activation of fluid pathways in space and time and their effect on methane yield, carbon-dioxide retention and hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir. We hypothesize that the conversion of single hydrate grains is a diffusion-controlled process which starts at the grain surface before continuing into the grain interior and show that the conversion can be modeled simply by using published permeation coefficients for CO2 and CH4 in hydrate and grain size as only input parameters.",

            "abstract": "As the largest group of fresh water bodies on Earth, the Laurentian Great Lakes have significant influence on local and regional weather and climate through their unique physical features compared with the surrounding land. Due to the limited spatial resolution and computational efficiency of general circulation models (GCMs), the Great Lakes are geometrically ignored or idealized into several grid cells in GCMs. Thus, the nested regional climate modeling (RCM) technique, known as dynamical downscaling, serves as a feasible solution to fill the gap. The latest Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is employed to dynamically downscale the historical simulation produced by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory-Coupled Model (GFDL-CM3) from 1970-2005. An updated lake scheme originated from the Community Land Model is implemented in the latest WRF version 3.6. It is a one-dimensional mass and energy balance scheme with 20-25 model layers, including up to 5 snow layers on the lake ice, 10 water layers, and 10 soil layers on the lake bottom. The lake scheme is used with actual lake points and lake depth. The preliminary results show that WRF-Lake model, with a fine horizontal resolution and realistic lake representation, provides significantly improved hydroclimates, in terms of lake surface temperature, annual cycle of precipitation, ice content, and lake-effect snowfall. Those improvements suggest that better resolution of the lakes and the mesoscale process of lake-atmosphere interaction are crucial to understanding the climate and climate change in the Great Lakes region.",

            "abstract": "Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs commonly serve students already committed to careers in science. To spark student interest in the sciences early in their college career, the CIRES diversity initiative teamed with the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory to build an REU for Colorado community college students.\nA group of 7 students was selected from consideration of diversity, prior training, and personal statements. Each student was paired with a research science mentor. Field excursions and team-building exercises filled the first week of the 8-week program. Students received weekly training in science communication, responsible conduct of research, use of spreadsheet and graphing software, and statistical analysis. Each student presented their research in a poster session, an oral presentation, and a written report.\nSeveral aspects of this pilot program worked well. The students formed a very supportive cohort, despite the fact that they were not in residence. Cohesion grew out of the immersion in field trips, and was reinforced with weekly check-ins. The trainings were essential for seeing projects through to written and oral presentations. Teaming students for fieldwork was an effective strategy to build support, and reduce mentor fatigue. Each student produced useful data.\nIn the future, we would include a workshop on personal finances to address a clear need. Transportation support will be provided. A residential program might attract some but could preclude participation of students with families or other life-issues. Personal tutoring tailored to research projects would address low math skills.\nAll 7 students completed the program; several elected to submit to the undergraduate virtual poster session at Fall AGU. Students all reported enormous personal and academic growth. Some are discussing transfer and graduate school opportunities with their mentors. The enthusiasm and appreciation of the students was unparalleled.",

            "abstract": "Although a great deal of progress has been made with various arctic observing efforts, it can be difficult to assess such progress when so many agencies, organizations, research groups and others are making such rapid progress. To help meet the strategic needs of the U.S. SEARCH-AON program and facilitate the development of SAON and related initiatives, the Arctic Observing Viewer (AOV; http://ArcticObservingViewer.org) has been developed. This web mapping application compiles detailed information pertaining to U.S. Arctic Observing efforts. Contributing partners include the U.S. NSF, USGS, ACADIS, ADIwg, AOOS, a2dc, AON, ARMAP, BAID, IASOA, INTERACT, and others. Over 6100 sites are currently in the AOV database and the application allows users to visualize, navigate, select, advance search, draw, print, and more. AOV is founded on principles of software and data interoperability and includes an emerging “Project” metadata standard, which uses ISO 19115-1 and compatible web services. In the last year, substantial efforts have focused on maintaining and centralizing all database information. In order to keep up with emerging technologies and demand for the application, the AOV data set has been structured and centralized within a relational database; furthermore, the application front-end has been ported to HTML5. Porting the application to HTML5 will now provide access to mobile users utilizing tablets and cell phone devices. Other application enhancements include an embedded Apache Solr search platform which provides users with the capability to perform advance searches throughout the AOV dataset, and an administration web based data management system which allows the administrators to add, update, and delete data in real time. We encourage all collaborators to use AOV tools and services for their own purposes and to help us extend the impact of our efforts and ensure AOV complements other cyber-resources. Reinforcing dispersed but interoperable resources in this way will help to ensure improved capacities for conducting activities such as assessing the status of arctic observing efforts, optimizing logistic operations, and for quickly accessing external and project-focused web resources for more detailed information and data.",

            "abstract": "Coral, like many other carbonate-secreting organisms, exerts strong control over its calcification process, resulting in an internal calcifying environment that departs from the ambient seawater. Most notably, pH of the coral calcifying fluid has been shown to be significantly elevated relative to seawater. Such pH regulation not only determines coral calcification responses to environmental changes (e.g. ocean acidification and rising temperature), but also affects the elemental and isotopic compositions of coral skeleton and complicates the interpretation of various geochemical proxies. Based on existing models of coral calcification and geochemical constraints on its pH regulation, I simulated the chemistry, especially pH, of the coral calcifying fluid, and evaluated the calcification responses to changing seawater chemistry among different coral species. Predictions from these simulations compare favorably with results from laboratory manipulation experiments, and suggest different coral species can exhibit different responses to ocean acidification depending on their respective capabilities to regulate the calcifying environment. The implication of these model results for interpreting geochemical proxies will also be discussed at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Lau and North Fiji backarc basins are located in a tectonically complex region of the South Pacific, where the upper mantle may have been modified by up to five hotspots (Samoa, Rurutu, Rarotonga, Macdonald, and Louisville), each with distinct geochemical fingerprints. We present new Hf, Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic data for basaltic samples dredged from seven areas along an east-west transect spanning the Lau and North Fiji basins to determine the possible influence and distribution of these various hotspot sources. We find that the isotope ratios of nearly all samples can be explained by mixing a depleted mantle component, which is ubiquitous in the Lau Basin, with a component similar to that found in Samoan shield (EMII) and/or rejuvenated (EMI) lavas. Lavas as far southwest as the Fiji Triple Junction (North Fiji Basin) show enriched geochemical signatures (87Sr/86Sr and 206Pb/204Pb up to 0.7037 and 18.635 respectively, and 143Nd/144Nd and 176Hf/177Hf down to 0.51285 and 0.283023, respectively) trending toward Samoa. This observation extends the range of Samoan influence into the North Fiji Basin 400 km south of its previous observed extent at South Pandora Ridge. The few samples that cannot be explained solely by incorporation of Samoan material are from the northeastern Lau Basin (Falloon et al., 2007) and host a dilute HIMU component that may relate to the incorporation of material from the Rurutu hotspot. This component is not observed further to the west in the Lau and North Fiji basins. A ubiquitous EMI signature in the region may be linked to the Rarotonga hotspot. New dredges from the northeast Lau Basin may give clearer signals that will reveal the identity of the enriched plume component.",

            "abstract": "Meltwater Pulse 1a (MWP1a; 14,600 years ago), is the largest rapid sea level rise event observed in geological records (~15 m in < 350 years). Its relative synchronicity with the unexplained and abrupt Northern Hemisphere Bolling warming (Deschamps et al., 2012) makes it a particularly interesting event. In order to understand the link between ice sheets, sea level and climate changes during that time, we must first determine the sources and causes of the sea level change. A recent study by Gregoire et al. (2012) modelled the evolution of North American and Greenland ice cover over the last deglaciation and suggested that the collapse of an ice saddle between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets could have been a major contributor to the meltwater pulse. However, the relative contributions of the Antarctic, North American and Eurasian ice sheets to MWP1a remain unconstrained.\nWe combined analysis of ice sheet modelling uncertainty with sea level fingerprinting to constrain the contribution of the North American ice sheet to MWP1a.\nTo explore uncertainties in climate and ice sheet processes, we performed ensembles of ice sheet model simulations with Glimmer-CISM, forced by transient deglacial experiments from two General Circulation Models (FAMOUS and CCSM3). The results were then compared with geological reconstructions of ice extent and sea level change to evaluate a probability distribution for the Northern American ice sheet contribution to MWP1a.\nWe also predicted the gravitationally self-consistent sea-level changes associated with the ice model simulations to explore whether the Laurentide-Cordilleran saddle collapse could have been the dominant source of MWP1a on the basis of fits to far-field sea-level records at Barbados, Tahiti and Sunda Shelf.\nBased on these interdisciplinary and multi-model results, we present a new scenario for the relative contributions of the different ice sheets to MWP1a.",

            "abstract": "Changes in extreme temperatures, heat waves, heavy rainfall events, and precipitation frequency can have adverse impacts on human health, air quality, agricultural productivity, and water resources. Using the aerosol only (AER) and greenhouse gas only (GHG) “single forcing” simulations (3 ensemble members each) from the GFDL CM3 chemistry-climate model, we investigate aerosol- versus greenhouse gas-induced changes in high temperature and precipitation extremes over the United States. We identify changes in these events from 1860 to 2005 and the associated large-scale dynamical conditions. Small changes in these extremes in the “all forcing” simulations reflect cancellations between the individual, opposite-signed effects of increasing anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases. In AER, aerosols lead to lower extreme high temperatures and fewer warm spells over the western US (-2.1 K regional average; -20 days/year) and over the central and northeast US (-1.5 K; -12 days/year). In GHG, a similar but opposite-signed response pattern occurs (+2.7 K and +14 days/year over the western US; +2.5 K and +10 days/year in the central and northeast US). The similar spatial response patterns in AER versus GHG suggest a preferred regional mode of response that is largely independent of the regional distribution of the forcing agent. The influence of both greenhouse gases and aerosols on extreme high temperature is weakest in the southeast US, collocated with the observed “warming hole”. No statistically significant change occurs in AER, and a warming of only +1.8 K occurs in GHG. Warming in this region continues to be muted over the 21st century under the RCP 8.5 scenario, with increases in extreme temperatures more than 1 K smaller than elsewhere. Aerosols induce decreases in the number of days per year with at least 10mm of precipitation (R10mm) over the eastern US in summer and winter and over the southern US in spring of roughly 1 day/year. In contrast, greenhouse gases induce increases in R10mm over the eastern US in winter (+0.8 days/year), the northern and central US during spring (+1 day/year), and the southeast US during summer (+0.5 days/year), but decreases over the northeast US in summer (-0.2 days/year). In RCP 8.5, the patterns of extreme temperature and precipitation associated with greenhouse gas forcing dominate.",

            "abstract": "Currently, many biogeochemical models lack the mechanistic capacity to accurately simulate soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, especially within intensely managed landscapes (IMLs) such as those found in the U.S. Midwest. These modeling limitations originate by not accounting for downslope connectivity of flowpathways initiated and governed by landscape processes and hydrologic forcing, which induce dynamic updates to the soil active layer (generally top 20-30cm of soil) with various sediment size fractions and aggregates being transported and deposited along the downslope. These hydro-geomorphic processes, often amplified in IMLs by tillage events and seasonal canopy, can greatly impact biogeochemical cycles (e.g., enhanced mineralization during aggregate breakdown) and in turn, have huge implications/uncertainty when determining SOC budgets. In this study, some of these limitations were addressed through a new concept, Potential Carbon Transport (PCT), a term which quantifies a maximum amount of material available for transport at various positions of the landscape, which was used to further refine a coupled modeling framework focused on SOC redistribution through downslope/lateral connectivity. Specifically, the size fractions slaked from large and small aggregates during raindrop-induced aggregate stability tests were used in conjunction with rainfall-simulated sediment enrichment ratio (ER) experiments to quantify the PCT under various management practices, soil types and landscape positions. Field samples used in determining aggregate stability and the ER experiments were collected/performed within the historic Clear Creek Watershed, home of the IML Critical Zone Observatory, located in Southeastern Iowa.",

            "abstract": "Increased rainfall/evaporation ratio had merged the Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee basins to a 260 km long Lake Lisan during the Last Glacial Maximum, 160 m below current mean sea level (mbsl). The timing of the natural drop to the 400 mbsl (Dead Sea level) has been precisely determined to 25-11 ka. Human settlements had initiated near the retreating shorelines at 21 ka. However, rather than following the dropping level, the subsequent settlement took advantage of swamps perched above 240 mbsl.\nAlong with an increased number of persons in the communities that left artefacts in the lacustrine and shore sediments, the technologies for exploiting the environment for survival had evolved. Some of the finds attest to activities that were not tied immediately to physical survival. The development of art and of social behaviour raises fascinating issues regarding our perception of the capabilities and motives of Mankind during the change from hunter-gatherer subsistence to one based on cultivation of plants and livestock associated with settlement.\nThe changes in the lifestyle are likely related to the environmental changes, some of which can be reconstructed by modern geological tools. On the other hand, some of the findings of the archaeological studies can help resolve geological issues, such as aridization around 9 ka, attested by initiation of gully washers that form boulder deposits over Netiv Hagdud site. The aridization is hindered relatively to lake level drop, presumably due to evolving spatial distribution of rainfall, where the rift shoulders still receive rain, while lake decline reflects aridization in the southern drainage, namely the Negev. This observation accords with speleothem studies from the rift shoulders.",

            "abstract": "High temperature (~300°C) hydrothermal alteration of peridotites can produce an alteration assemblage abundant in Fe-bearing serpentine and magnetite without the presence of brucite. This is particularly so in systems with SiO2-rich fluids derived from the hydration of orthopyroxene in basaltic intrusions and gabbros [1]. Few experimental studies have investigated the effects of aSiO2(aq) on the rate of olivine serpentinization and none that have examined the Fe isotopic composition of olivine hydrolysis products. Thus, this study addresses these problems by using flexible gold cell hydrothermal equipment to react olivine (Fo90) and talc with a NaCl-bearing fluid at 300 °C and 500 bars for ~90 days; providing time-series solution chemistry data coupled with Fe isotope, magnetic susceptibility, and Mössbauer measurements of reactant olivine and the serpentinization product. Talc is used to elevate the aSiO2(aq)above the serpentine-brucite buffer, effectively preventing brucite formation and allowing only the formation of Fe-bearing serpentine and magnetite from olivine alteration.\nInitial time series solution chemistry data indicate that the net rate of the serpentinization of olivine and talc dissolution is such that the experimental system is poised between the serpentine-brucite and serpentine-talc stability fields, with little H2 generated by the oxidation of Fe2+ upon formation of Fe-serpentine and magnetite. However, as the talc Si-source becomes effectively titrated, the continued hydration of olivine decreases the aSiO2(aq) towards the serpentine-brucite stability field concurrent with an increasing rate of H2 generation. This chemical transition likely reflects an enhanced rate of magnetite formation upon a decrease in the relative stability of Fe-serpentine. Fe isotope data indicate a slight enrichment trend in δ56Fe versus Fe3+/ΣFe of the altered mineral phases, magnetite > Fe-serpentine > olivine, although the observed inter-mineral fractionations are small, <0.1 ‰. These experimental data are consistent with observations of natural Fe isotope data derived from hydrothermally altered peridotites [2] while providing requisite quantitative constraints to understand better their origin and evolution.\n[1] Bach et al., 2006 (GRL)\n[2] Craddock et al., 2014 (EPSL)",

            "abstract": "In 1983 Techno, Inc. collected five seismic reflection profiles in the region between Whitefish, Montana and the United States-Canada border. The poulter method was used to gather four of these profiles and one profile was collected using a vibroseis source. We are currently reprocessing these data in order to construct a regional geological interpretation. The profiles cover a key position in the hinterland of the Cordillera in the lee of the Lewis thrust salient where the east-northeast verging Lewis thrust fault system translated (horizontal displacement >100 km) and inverted a thick, strong slab of primarily Belt-Purcell rocks out of a deep Precambrian depositional basin onto a cratonic platform. In this event, Belt-Purcell rocks were thrust over complexly imbricated Phanerozoic strata in the foreland. Late Mesozoic compressional deformation was followed by Cenozoic extensional collapse of the over-thickened Cordillera and subsequent basin and range style deformation that produced an array of northwest trending grabens. Three of the seismic profiles cross the Rocky Mountain Trench; the Trench is a linear structure of regional dimension that is an expression of the extensional fragmentation of the Cordillera. Strong reflections, interpreted as sills encased within Lower Belt rocks (encountered in the Arco-Marathon 1 Paul Gibbs borehole), outline the complexly folded and faulted structure of the eastern limb of the Purcell anticlinorium. East of the Rocky Mountain Trench stratified reflections within Belt rocks clearly outline the Wigwam Thrust. Beneath the Whitefish Range, an apparent inflection in the strongly reflective basal Cambrian veneer marks the westerly increase in dip of the Rocky Mountain Basal Detachment. The dip contrast between the foreland and hinterland might be a manifestation of the tectonic loading of the Belt basin margin and the loading might have localized extension across the Rocky Mountain Trench.",

            "abstract": "Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has greatly expanded the number volcanoes that can be monitored for ground deformation – the number of known deforming volcanoes has increased almost five-fold since 1997 (to more than 213 volcanoes in 2014). However, from 1992-2014, there are still gaps in global volcano surveillance and only a fraction of the 1400 subaerial Holocene volcanoes have frequent observations in this time period. Starting in 2014, near global observations of volcano deformation should begin with the Sentinel satellites from the European Space Agency, ALOS-2 from the Japanese Space Agency, and eventually NISAR from the Indian Space Agency and NASA. With more frequent observations, more volcano deformation episodes are sure to be observed, but evaluating the significance of the observed deformation is not always straightforward -- how can we determine if deformation will lead to eruption? To answer this question, an international task force has been formed to create an inventory of volcano deformation events as part of the Global Volcano Model (http://globalvolcanomodel.org/gvm-task-forces/volcano-deformation-database/).\nWe present the first results from our global study focusing on volcanoes that have few or no previous studies. In some cases, there is a lack of SAR data (for example, volcanoes of the South Sandwich Islands). For others, observations either show an absence of deformation or possible deformation that requires more data to be verified. An example of a deforming volcano that has few past studies is Pagan, an island in the Marianas Arc comprised of 2 stratovolcanoes within calderas. Our new InSAR measurements from both the ALOS and Envisat satellites show deformation near the 1981 May VEI 4 lava flow eruption on North Pagan at 2-3 cm/year between 2004-2010. Another example of a newly observed volcano is Karthala volcano in the Comoros. InSAR observations between 2004-2010 span four eruptions, only one of which is accompanied by deformation.",

            "abstract": "The New Horizons mission is due to fly-by the Pluto system in Summer 2015 and provides the first opportunity to image the Pluto surface in detail, allowing both the appearance and number of its crater population to be studied for the first time. Bray and Schenk (2014) combined previous cratering studies and numerical modeling of the impact process to predict crater morphology on Pluto based on current understanding of Pluto’s composition, structure and surrounding impactor population. Predictions of how the low mean impact velocity (~2km/s) of the Pluto system will influence crater formation is a complex issue. Observations of secondary cratering (low velocity, high angle) and laboratory experiments of impact at low velocity are at odds regarding how velocity controls depth-diameter ratios: Observations of secondary craters show that these low velocity craters are shallower than would be expected for a hyper-velocity primary. Conversely, gas gun work has shown that relative crater depth increases as impact velocity decreases. We have investigated the influence of impact velocity further with iSALE hydrocode modeling of comet impact into Pluto. With increasing impact velocity, a projectile will produce wider and deeper craters. The depth-diameter ratio (d/D) however has a more complex progression with increasing impact velocity: impacts faster than 2km/s lead to smaller d/D ratios as impact velocity increases, in agreement with gas-gun studies. However, decreasing impact velocity from 2km/s to 300 m/s produced smaller d/D as impact velocity was decreased. This suggests that on Pluto the deepest craters would be produced by ~ 2km/s impacts, with shallower craters produced by velocities either side of this critical point. Further simulations to investigate whether this effect is connected to the sound speed of the target material are ongoing. The complex relationship between impact velocity and crater depth for impacts occurring between 300m/s and 10 km/s suggests that there might be a larger range of ‘pristine’ crater depths on Pluto than on bodies with higher mean impact velocity. This might affect our ability to define a pristine crater depth as a starting point for crater infill and relaxation studies.",

            "abstract": "This presentation focuses on linking climate knowledge to the complicated decision process for hydropower dam licensing, and the affected parties involved in that process. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues of licenses for nonfederal hydroelectric operations, typically 30-50 year licenses, and longer infrastructure lifespan, a similar time frame as the anticipated risks of changing climate and hydrology. Resources managed by other federal and state agencies such as the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service may be affected by new or re-licensed projects. The federal Integrated Licensing Process gives the opportunity for affected parties to recommend issues for consultative investigation and possible mitigation, such as impacts to downstream fisheries. New or re-licensed projects have the potential to “pre-adapt” by considering and incorporating risks of climate change into their planned operations as license terms and conditions. Hundreds of hydropower facilities will be up for relicensing in the coming years (over 100 in the western Sierra Nevada alone, and large-scale water projects such as the proposed Lake Powell Pipeline), as well as proposed new dams such as the Susitna project in Alaska. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive guidance on delivering climate analysis to support understanding of risks of hydropower projects to other affected resources, and decisions on licensing. While each project will have a specific context, many of the questions will be similar.\nWe also will discuss best practices for the use of climate science in water project planning and management, and how creating the best and most appropriate science is also still a developing art. We will discuss the potential reliability of that science for consideration in long term planning, licensing, and mitigation planning for those projects. For science to be “actionable,” that science must be understood and accepted by the potential users. This process is a negotiation, with climate scientists needing to understand the concerns of users and respond, and users developing a better understanding of the state of climate science in order to make an informed choice. We will also discuss what is needed to streamline providing that analysis for the many re-licensing decisions expected in the upcoming years.",

            "abstract": "Glacial and tectonic processes on active margins are intrinsically coupled to the transport of sediment and associated organic carbon (OC). Glaciation/deglaciation and the formation of ice sheets can alter the quantity and composition of OC delivered to the marine environment. Over geologic time scales (>1 Ma), exhumation and mass wasting of sedimentary rock from uplifted accretionary wedges inject recycled OC (e.g. kerogen), along with modern OC into the marine environment.\nThe sedimentary record of glacial and tectonic processes along the southern Alaska margin is particularly well preserved at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1417. Lithofacies of Site U1417 can be divided into 3 sedimentary packages that we interpret as linked to the onset of tidewater glaciation along, and tectonic convergence of the Yakutat Terrane with, the continental margin of northwestern Canada and southern Alaska. Based on previous studies linking the development of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and the movement of the Yakutat Terrane to the development of the Surveyor Fan System, we hypothesize biogeochemical variations in the deposited sediments as a result of changing provenance.\nPreservation of terrestrial OC that has been documented in sediments of the Alaskan continental shelf margin and sediment routing through the deep-sea Surveyor Channel from the Pleistocene to modern time implies a long-term conduit for this OC to reach the distal portion of the Surveyor Fan system. To correlate marine deposits with terrestrial formations, bulk geochemical and detailed biomarker analyses are used to delineate source material. Preliminary bulk OC content and stable carbon isotope analyses of the Yakataga, Poul Creek, and Kultheith Fms. reveal notable differences. Detailed biomarker analysis by pyrolysis-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry has revealed further differences between the three primary formations. Using the biogeochemical fingerprints of the Yakataga, Poul Creek, and coal-bearing Kulthieth Fms., the source of sediments delivered to the Surveyor Fan over the past ~10Ma can be better determined, providing further insight into erosion patterns of the Yakutat Terrane during tectonic transport and under the influence of tidewater glaciation.",

            "abstract": "Intensively managed landscapes (IMLs) in the Midwestern United States are heavily modified by agriculture, artificial drainage, deforestation, urbanization, and wetland destruction. These landscapes have been shaped by repeated glacial events over geologic time scales followed with rapid human modifications for agriculture and drainage that are overlaid on extremely low gradient stream networks.\nIn this study, using LiDAR data from the Upper Sangamon River Basin in Illinois, we attempt to understand how the long-term glacial legacy has shaped the landscape and what is the impact from short-term human activities, such as channel straightening and periodic dredging. Glacial and human legacy impact landscape dynamics simultaneously. Therefore, we evaluate the present-day dynamics of landscapes by attempting to address several questions. First, we explore whether the watershed is in equilibrium conditions or away from it due to human activities. Second, we study how this relates to the degree of maturity in the river valley. Moreover, we map the spatial distributions of terraces and floodplains to understand depositional and erosional history.\nHigh-resolution LiDAR data is ideal for such a study as it reveals the impact of both glacial episodes and human activities. Methods used for extraction of useful information from LiDAR data include the TerEx tool, Stream Profiler, and Hec-GeoRas, among others. We analyze the terrace and floodplain geomorphic features, quantify stream sinuosity, and cross section geometries. An integral method is built based on stream power incision model to obtain sub-basin steady state condition. These features help to reveal local and global watershed properties. A bounded relationship between terraces/floodplains, sinuosity, cross section maturity, as well as sub-basin equilibrium condition is explored. In general, we find that the glacial legacy and present-day human activity have opposed each other in regards to the sub-basin equilibrium conditions of USRB. These studies of historic and recent floodplain dynamics from high-resolution topography will enhance our understanding of intensively managed landscapes, which will strengthen the understanding of watershed dynamics under human impact.",

            "abstract": "The enormous advances in scientific understanding of the earth in the last 400 years led to a remarkable flourishing of humanity, but it also resulted in the disruption of critical systems on which we depend. Around the world, soil is lost faster than it forms; groundwater is withdrawn faster than it recharges; biodiversity and biocapacity are crashing; fossil fuels are 87% of our primary energy sources despite their many problems, including steadily rising emissions of CO2. Since 1600, science has honed an ethic of objectivity that insists that facts and values – scientific work and its real world outcomes – remain separate. As a result, our economy and society applaud as loudly when our graduates land jobs that further damage earth systems as when they seek to preserve them. Geoethics aims at the idea that balancing human action with the capacity of planetary systems is the primary “good.” Without healthy systems, we cannot thrive. Period. Ethical systems developed to mediate human relations are inadequate to find this balance: they implicitly acknowledge a rationality that places the highest value on short-term growth and efficiency, not on living sustainably in the long run. The best paragon of sustainability is the co-evolution of life and other systems on our planet over 3.5 billion years.\n This presentation explores the contributions of Gregory Bateson and other scientists to understanding systems in cybernetic terms. Bateson suggested that “What we believe ourselves to be should be compatible with what we believe of the world around us.” In other words, the path to a sustainable geoethics begins by re-internalizing lessons that humans alone in the biotic community seem to have forgotten. What are the “rules” by which systems sustain themselves? What do self-sustaining systems “value?” How can we help ourselves and our students learn them? I suggest that paying attention to the process of learning itself is an effective first step, and describe the use of a learning cycle model based on system cybernetics. The model provides a structure in which we and our students can reflect on our connections with the world and the limitations on what we can learn about it. I also show how to use campus and other landscapes to clarify the gap between human ethics and a sustainable geoethics.",

            "abstract": "The Guatemala Suture Zone (GSZ) features two serpentinite mélanges straddling the Motagua Fault system. In both North and South Motagua Mélanges (NMM and SMM, respectively), blocks of high-pressure, low-temperature metabasites (e.g., eclogites) are embedded into a serpentinite matrix, together with vein-related rocks (e.g., jadeitites). The origin of serpentinite forming the matrix is still unclear. It is commonly believed to represent either the seafloor / oceanic mantle hydrated by infiltration of seawater or the forearc mantle wedge hydrated by fluid released during subduction. Nowadays, the few data available on serpentinites from Mariana forearc, abyssal peridotite or ophiolitic massifs show positive or slightly negative δ11B (-4.6 to +40‰), in support of the assumption of a shallow origin for the fluid. However, it has been suggested that serpentinites could form much deeper within a subduction channel (~ 30 km depth).\nIn situ boron analyses on antigorite from serpentinites of the GSZ have been carried out by LA-MC-ICPMS and SIMS. Serpentine matrices have low to moderate B concentrations, between 2 and 15µg/g. They display somewhat negative isotopic values, with δ11B of -8.2 ± 2.8 and -11.9 ± 1.2‰ for samples from the NMM, and δ11B of -4.1 ± 3.0 and -11.1 ± 1.8‰ for a sample from the SMM. In addition, this sample contains a late antigorite vein showing a δ11B of -3.0 ± 3.5‰, and some veinlets with scattered values (δ11B ranging from -12.5 ± 0.9 to -6.4 ± 1.4‰).\nThis first suite of measurements carried out directly on serpentinites from serpentinite mélanges displays very negative values, which do not overlap with previously published data. It indicates that the ultramafic precursors of the serpentine from the GSZ Serpentinite Mélanges were not hydrated by seawater, or by fluid released during the early stages of subduction. Rather, these negative values indicate that the fluid responsible for the hydration of ultramafic rocks likely comes from deep stages of slab devolatilization, in agreement with the hypothesis of deep serpentinite formation in the subduction channel. Thus, the serpentinite matrix of the mélanges probably represents hydrated mantle wedge.",

            "abstract": "To a large part, the seismicity of Switzerland is characterized by swarm-like earthquake sequences of natural, and to a minor extent of man-made origin. Many of these sequences have been studied using relative location techniques, which often allowed to constrain the active fault plane of the larger events in a sequence and shed light on the tectonic processes that drive the seismicity. Yet, in the majority of cases the number of located earthquakes was too small to infer the details of the space-time evolution of the sequences, and their statistical parameters (e.g. magnitude-frequency distribution, Omori parameters). Therefore, it has been largely impossible to resolve clear patterns in the seismicity of individual earthquake sequences that are needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind, and the differences between natural and induced earthquake sequences.\nHere we show how a combination of well-established seismological tools can significantly improve the completeness of detected and located earthquakes in surface network catalogs. By taking advantage of the waveform similarity in natural and induced earthquake sequences in Switzerland we are able to detect seismic events several orders of magnitude below the detection threshold of classical signal energy based detectors. For this purpose we have implemented a multi-trace cross-correlation detector that either runs in “template mode” using a set of representative earthquakes (templates) of a sequence, or in “sub-space mode” using characteristic waveforms derived from the templates by singular value decomposition. Waveform similarity is then further exploited to derive accurate and consistent earthquake magnitudes for the sequences. Finally we derive a similarity-distance relationship from a set of double-difference re-located events with larger magnitudes (DD reference set) for each sequence. These relationships are then used to locate tiny earthquakes, which are often only recorded at one station, with respect to the DD reference sets using a cross-correlation location technique.\nIn this way it is possible to provide earthquake scientist with the data they need to better understand the processes and physics behind natural and induced microseismicity.",

            "abstract": "As part of an NSF PIRE grant, we have led four field trips for undergraduate, MS and PhD students to large deltaic systems. Three trips took US students to the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta in Bangladesh and one brought Bangladeshi faculty and students to the Mississippi (Miss.) delta in the US. An essential component in the learning process and overall experience of each trip was that ~2/5 of the participants were students and professors from Bangladesh. In all cases, the involvement of a substantial international cohort greatly broadened perspectives on the topics being covered. For example, in GBD the local geologic and cultural knowledge of the Bangladeshis deepened the learning and engagement of the US students, an outcome that was almost universally noted in student reviews. The trips received similar feedback from Bangladeshi participants, as they had an enthusiastic and engaged audience of peers from the US. Even for the Miss. delta trip, the Bangladeshis added a unique perspective from a nation that faces similar environmental issues. These overwhelmingly positive contributions have been experienced in several different contexts. Three trips were associated with US courses and run over Spring Break. One matched sustainable development undergrads at Columbia U. with geology undergrads from Dhaka U., and two others matched a mixed group of graduate and undergrad students from Vanderbilt U. with cohorts from Bangladesh. The fourth trip was a stand-alone Field School for PhD students from 14 US universities and mostly MS students from 4 Bangladeshi universities. The focus of each trip ranged from broader surveys of tectonic, fluvial and coastal processes to investigations of geology and people affected by tropical storms. Of particular interest was the success of mixing undergrad and graduate students in the Vanderbilt course, which centered on the intersection of social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. In this case, undergrads engaged in a liberal arts education brought a generally broader perspective than the more specialized graduate students. Overcoming this condition for the grad students is one of the principal reasons that the course was designed, and incorporating undergrads involved in the humanities and social disciplines invigorated these transdisciplinary aspects of the course.",

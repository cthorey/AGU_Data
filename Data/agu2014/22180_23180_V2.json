            "abstract": "Dissolved neodymium (Nd) isotopes (expressed as εNd) have been widely used as a water mass tracer to reconstruct paleo ocean circulation. However, the marine geochemical cycle of Nd is not well understood. Unclear input mechanisms, scarcity of available data, and observed decoupling between dissolved εNd and Nd concentration patterns ([Nd]) are only a few of the unresolved issues. The latter is often referred to as the Nd paradox(e.g. Goldstein and Hemming 2003).\nHere we revisit this paradox with an unprecedented data set on particulate Nd isotope and concentration data from five stations along the Dutch GEOTRACES transect GA02 in the western North and equatorial Atlantic Ocean (cruises 64PE319 and 64PE321 from April to July 2010). Particulates were collected with in-situ pumps on 0.8 µm Supor filters and subjected to a total digestion procedure in the home laboratory.\nThe particulates collected farthest north (Irminger Sea and Labrador Sea) show a strong affinity to the nearby land masses in their Nd isotope composition: Very negative values (εNd ≈-20) are observed in the Labrador Sea, which is surrounded by old continental rocks. More positive values of up to εNd ≈-4 are found east of Greenland probably derived from the Nansen Fjord Formation’s basaltic rocks. In these two areas the particulate εNd is offset from dissolved Nd isotopes by up to 7.7 ε-units, but reveals a similar vertical distribution. Further downstream of the flow path of the North Atlantic Deep Water, dissolved and particulate Nd isotopic compositions in the water column seem to merge and become indistinguishable from one another south of Bermuda (BATS station). This seems to indicate that particulate and dissolved fractions exchange with increasing distance from source regions and age of water masses. Neodymium concentrations in particulates [pNd] are low (KD<5%) and invariant. However, most stations show a significant increase in [pNd] close to the seafloor, where [pNd] nearly matches [dNd].\nOur new data set provides invaluable information towards addressing the Nd paradox as it constitutes the first regional data set on combined Nd concentrations and isotopes in particulate and dissolved samples.\n",

            "abstract": "With an expanding role of wind energy in satisfying energy demands around the world, wind farms are covering increasingly larger surfaces to the point where interaction between wind farms and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) might have significant implications. Furthermore, many wind farm sites lie over existing farmland for which water is a precious resource. In this context, a relevant question yet to be fully understood, is whether large wind farms alter near surface temperatures and evaporation rates and if so, by how much.\n In the present study, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a geostrophic wind driven ABL with two active scalars, temperature and specific humidity, in the presence of Coriolis forces with an embedded wind farm are performed. Multiple ‘synthetic’ diurnal cycles are simulated by imposing a time-varying surface temperature and specific humidity. Wind turbines are modeled using the “actuator disk” approach along with the flexibility to reorient according to varying flow directions. LES is performed using the “pseudo-spectral” approach implying that an infinitely large wind farm is simulated.\n Comparison of simulations with and without wind farms show clear differences in vertical profiles of horizontal velocity magnitude and direction, turbulent kinetic energy and scalar fluxes. To better understand these differences, a detailed analysis of the constituent terms of budget equations of mean and turbulent kinetic energy and sensible and latent heat fluxes has been performed for different stratification regimes as the ABL evolves during the diurnal cycle. The analyses help explain the effect of wind farms on the characteristics of the low-level jet, depth of the stable boundary layer, formation and growth of the convective boundary layer (CBL) and scalar fluxes at the surface.",

It consists of two cameras, a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC, 2000 mm focal length) and a Wide Angle Camera (WAC, 200 mm focal length). The NAC has sensitivity from 200 nm to 1100 nm. The WAC is sensitive from 350 nm to 1100 nm. Among the mission highlights thus far for ISS have been discoveries of particulate plumes from Enceladus, details of surface topography along the ‘tiger stripes’, the discovery of an equatorial ridge on Iapetus, detailed images of small inner moons and distant moons Phoebe and Hyperion, features in Saturn’s rings including perturbed edges near embedded moons, ‘propellers’, ephemeral clumps, and evidence for impacts in the rings and free-oscillation modes in Saturn’s interior. The camera documented the aftermath of a methane/ethane ‘rain’ storm on Titan as well as seasonal behavior in the detached haze and visible airglow generated by magnetospheric plasma. The cameras documented the formation and evolution of a giant storm on Saturn, lightning from storms on Saturn, and determined that eddies are powering Saturn’s zonal jets. In the F-ring and Proximal orbits ISS will obtain even better resolution on the rings, planet and inner moons.",

However, beyond the scale of an indivudal lake, quantifying their contribution to global energy and carbon budgets and their responses to climate change is not trivial. In this study we have undertaken an analysis of the results of a multi-lake modelling project in an attempt to characterise how the slope of the net energy exchange vs average annual air temperature relationship is affected by physical lake characteristics. For the initial study, 30 lakes with a variety of morphometries, climatic, hydrological and trophic characteristics were simulated for a period of 2 years using a the General Lake Model (GLM), a simple 1-D hydrodynamic model. The physical mixing parameters used to quantify heat and momentum budgets were determined using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach that optimised model output to observed temperature profile data. Surface energy budget components, as calculated by the model for each lake, were then compared to a variety of lake metrics, such as lake depth, volume and residence time, to quantify relationships between the slope of the net energy and air temperature curve. The analysis demonstrates that integration of numerical models with data from a global sensor network can be an effective way to parameterise complex relationships between limnological characteristics and energy budgets.",

We also integrate new petrologic, thermometric and barometric data to read a 4D narrative of the magmatic processes within this volcanic plumbing system preceding­­- and during- eruption.\nUsing this perspective we can identify and semi-quantify magmatic componentry, detect new magmatic inputs, and ‘watch’ those crystal chemical populations age. We find that major crystal-liquid disequilibrium events occurred up to several years preceding the eruptions, and inputs fed the plumbing system during the eruption window (days – hours). We place timeframes upon processes including magma-mixing, mush remobilization and erosion, and final-ascent quenching and eruption.\nFe-Mg binary diffusion in olivine modelling conducted upon this scale was made possible using new advances –also presented here– in both the gathering and processing of raw data, and extraction of timescale information. We demonstrate that this streamlined workflow can now produce statistically robust timescale data within an integrated petrologic and geochemical context that may be resolved alongside independent geophysical and other remote sensing data into a common dimension – time. Transposing petrologic information (record of past process) and geophysical observation (phenomenological in the present) into a common language is designed to produce new understanding of both active and palaeo- volcanic systems, the implications of which we discuss here using our case study as an example.",

            "abstract": "We present spatiotemporal variations of methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in the UT/LS observed mainly by the CARIBIC passenger aircraft for the years 2005–2011. The CH3Cl mixing ratio in the UT over Europe was higher than that observed at a European surface baseline station year-round, indicative of a persistent positive vertical gradient at NH mid latitudes. A series of flights over Africa and South Asia show that CH3Cl mixing ratios increase toward tropical latitudes, and the observed UT CH3Cl level over these two regions and the Atlantic was higher than that measured at remote surface sites. Strong emissions of CH3Cl in the tropics combined with meridional transport through the UT may explain such vertical and latitudinal gradients. Comparisons with CO data indicate that non-combustion sources in the tropics dominantly contribute to forming the latitudinal gradient of CH3Cl in the UT. We also observed elevated CH3Cl and CO in air influenced by biomass burning in South America and Africa, and the enhancement ratios derived for CH3Cl to CO in those regions agree with previous observations. In contrast, correlations indicate a high CH3Cl to CO ratio of 2.9±0.5 ppt ppb-1 in the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone and domestic biofuel emissions in South Asia are inferred to be responsible. We estimated CH3Cl emissions from South Asia to be 134±23 Gg Cl yr-1, which is higher than a previous estimate due to the higher CH3Cl to CO ratio observed in this study.\nWe also examine the use of CH3Cl as a tracer of tropical tropospheric air in the LMS, where we identified air masses with elevated CH3Cl that were however stratospheric in terms of N2O. Back trajectories suggest recent low-latitude origins of such air masses in early summer. In this season, high CH3Cl LMS air shows a clear branch connecting stratospheric and tropical tropospheric air on N2O-CH3Cl scatterplots. This distinct feature vanishes in late summer when the LMS is ventilated by tropospheric air.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of subsurface stratigraphic relationships is guided by stratigraphic concepts that were developed using many varieties and scales of data including paleontological samples, cuttings and core, outcrop analogs, well logs, and seismic. Subsurface stratigraphic correlations are strongly influenced by the type, density, and distribution of the data available. The exploration geologist typically interprets 2D and 3D seismic reflections to define prospects and plays. In structurally simple areas, he or she often assumes that seismic reflectors mark depositional boundaries that are essentially time-synchronous events represented by a single wavelet character. In reality, seismic reflectors usually display spatial wavelet variability, seldom resolve individual beds and are the product of the amplitude expression of a range of lithologic changes that encompasses a range of geologic time and depositional processes. Our assumption that seismic reflections are time-synchronous can lead to errors in stratigraphic correlation that only become evident when our prediction of well or field performance is unrealized. To mitigate the potential for this correlation error, we must modify how we interpret seismic data. \n In this presentation we will focus on the concept of defining or approximating time-correlative surfaces in seismic data, leverage concepts of the Wheeler transform to place these seismic reflectors into the relative time domain and then examine the diachronous nature of these time-mapped surfaces in 3D. We will then explore how the 3D mapping of time-correlative surfaces fits sequence stratigraphic concepts and discuss whether this new approach requires us to change our interpretation paradigms.",

The groundwater wells are located on the recharge area of LiWu and Hualien river basins. 10 groundwater samples have been collected from different monitoring wells, which are artificial and all around 21-97 meters deep, and the altitude of them are less than 125-953 meters. Samples sent to University of Tokyo for further T-He dating analysis. We could obtain total helium-3 concentrations in groundwater samples, although they might contain different signatures other than radiogenic source from tritium decay. In order to obtain the radiogenic helium-3 concentration, we needed to eliminate helium-3 concentrations of air-saturated water and terrigenic source in spite of air contamination. In this study, we can successfully separate the radiogenic source of helium-3 from terrigenic (crustal and mantle) source, as well as air contamination for the studied samples. After helium-3 corrections, we can obtain the age results, which are not older than 40 years, with terrigenic signature of 0.13 Ra. The result suggests that the T-He dating technique could be a good method for determining the age of young groundwater in Taiwan.",

Tropical ecosystems are particularly threatened due to climate change, invasive species, farming and natural resources exploitation. Recent advances in remote sensing of biodiversity confirmed the potential of high spatial resolution spectroscopic imagery for species identification and biodiversity mapping. Such information bridges the scale-gap between small-scale, highly detailed field studies and large-scale, low-resolution satellite observations. In order to produce fine-scale resolution maps of canopy alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of the Peruvian Amazonian forest, we designed, applied and validated a method based on spectral variation hypothesis to CAO AToMS (Carnegie Airborne Observatory Airborne Taxonomic Mapping System) images, acquired from 2011 to 2013. There is a need to understand on a quantitative basis the physical processes leading to this spectral variability. This spectral variability mainly depends on canopy chemistry, structure, and sensor’s characteristics. 3D radiative transfer modeling provides a powerful framework for the study of the relative influence of each of these factors in dense and complex canopies. We simulated series of spectroscopic images with the 3D radiative model DART, with variability gradients in terms of leaf chemistry, individual tree structure, spatial and spectral resolution, and applied methods for biodiversity mapping. This sensitivity study allowed us to determine the relative influence of these factors on the radiometric signal acquired by different types of sensors. Such study is particularly important to define the domain of validity of our approach, to refine requirements for the instrumental specifications, and to help preparing hyperspectral spatial missions to be launched at the horizon 2015-2025 (EnMAP, PRISMA, HISUI, SHALOM, HYSPIRI, HYPXIM).

            "abstract": "The Siwaliks sediments are shed from the uplifting Himalaya and stored in its foreland basin. They represent critical archive of climate changes in this region but more specifically may have recorded the flexural, unroofing and shortenning history of the Himalaya. As mainly continental in origine the Siwaliks are often poorly dated via classic biostratigraphy. Hence, numerous magnetostratigraphic analyses have been carried out providing a rather good chronology of the Siwaliks group. However, these studies have several flaws. The proposed correlations to the reference scale of each individual magnetostratigraphic columns remain subjective and therefore ambiguous. Only one unique correlation is often presented while the other likelihood possibilities are not mentioned. Hence, the possible derived uncertainties and ambiguities are never discussed. Moreover, most of the studied sections expose fine grained sediments shed by relatively small rivers which catch only a limited part of the Himalaya. The past sediments of larger Himalayan rivers (Yamuna, Ganga, Karnali, Narayani and Kosi) draining the entire range are more relevant to decipher the tectono-climatic hystory of the Himalayas. However, these rivers mainly deposited in the foreland large and coarse grained fans less suitable for paleomagnetic analyses. At last, very few magnetostratigraphic studies have documented sediments younger than 4-5Myrs while important climate changes occurred during this period.\nTherefore our study aims to reconsider the previous magnetostratigraphic correlations using a numerical method based on the dynamic time wraping algorithm. This new method automatically provides a set of reasonably likely correlations and hence enables to discuss possible ambiguities in the magnetostratigraphic correlations. It also provides uncertainties on sediment accumulation rates which will be used to better estimate the flexural and shortening history of the Himalayas.\nOur study also aims to better constrain the depositional ages of young Siwalik sediments deposited by a large river. Therefore, we carried out three new magnetostratigraphic sections located in the Valmiki National Park in India which expose coarse and young sediments deposited by the recent Narayani river through a large paleo-fan.",

            "abstract": "In situ thermal treatment (ISTT) technologies, such as electrical resistance heating (ERH) and thermal conductive heating (TCH), rely on the in situ production of a gas phase composed of steam and vaporized volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This gas phase must be captured, extracted, and processed in an aboveground treatment system to meet remediation objectives. When used to treat volatile non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), gases can be created at temperatures below the boiling points of both the groundwater and the NAPL, in a process commonly referred to as co-boiling, and vaporized VOCs can condense if gases are transported to colder regions or are not captured before thermal treatment has stopped. As such, an understanding of gas formation, connection, and flow is important for the design and operation of ISTT technologies. A recent series of laboratory experiments focused on the visualization and quantification of gas dynamics during water boiling and NAPL-water co-boiling, and the investigation of potential NAPL redistribution. Experiments were conducted in a sand-packed glass-walled chamber (40 cm tall × 20 cm wide × 1 cm thick) heated by electrical resistance. Temperatures and electric currents were measured, and digital images were captured throughout the experiments to quantify gas saturations using light transmission techniques. Additional experiments also investigated the exsolution of dissolved gas as a technique to enhance gas production at lower temperatures. Results showed the development of disconnected and connected gas flow regimes, with disconnected flow occurring at early times and during co-boiling. Results also showed the potential for NAPL redistribution due to displacement by gas formed within pools, and due to condensation in colder regions. These results highlight the need to carefully consider gases in the design of ISTT heating and gas extraction systems to ensure remediation performance.",

In total, this study used 15 indicators to create an IFRI map for the region, and 5 categories of flood risk were distinguished: “very high,” “high,” “medium,” “low,” and “very low.” The results, which were presented in ternary diagrams to illustrate the relative importance of the three different components, show that urban areas in the Korean Han River basin have experienced a decrease of 1.0% in terms of the hydrologic component. However, the socio-economic and ecological components have increased by 3.2% and 4.4%, respectively. In rural areas, an increase of 4.8% was found in the hydrologic component alongside decreases in the socio-economic (1.6%) and ecological (2.2%) factors. In addition, the IFRI map shows that 20.02% of the total area of the Han River Basin was classified as having “very high” or “high” flood risk; the size of this high-risk zone has increased significantly by since 1990. This study also evaluated flood risks according to the different phases of conditions, and the results from the analysis indicate that flood risks were worse during strong cold-tongue (CT) and warm-pool (WP) El Niño years. Further analyses of possible factors that affect the vulnerability and resilience of communities to flood hazards in the Han River basin should be conducted on the basis of this research. Accordingly, the results from this study may provide useful data for reducing flood risks in developing areas that are experiencing.",

            "abstract": "With a growing urbanisation and the emergence of climate change, the world is facing a more water constrained future. This phenomenon will have direct impacts on the resilience and performance of energy sector as water is playing a key role in electricity generation processes. As energy is becoming a thirstier resource and the pressure on finite water sources is increasing, modelling and analysing this closely interlinked and interdependent loop, called ‘water-energy nexus’ is becoming an important cross-disciplinary challenge. Conflict often arises in transboundary river where several countries share the same source of water to be used in productive sectors for economic growth. From the perspective of the upstream users, it would be ideal to store the water for hydropower generation and protect the city against drought whereas the downstream users need the supply of water for growth. This research use the case study on the transboundary Blue Nile River basin located in the Middle East where the Ethiopian government decided to invest on building a new dam to store the water and generate hydropower. This leads to an opposition by downstream users as they believe that the introduction of the dam would reduce the amount of water available downstream. This calls for a compromise management where the reservoir operating rules need to be derived considering the interdependencies between the resources available and the requirements proposed by all users. For this, we link multiobjective optimization algorithm to water-energy use simulation model to achieve effective management of the transboundary reservoir operating strategies. The objective functions aim to attain social and economic welfare by minimizing the deficit of water supply and maximizing the hydropower generation. The study helps to improve the policies by understanding the value of water and energy in their alternative uses. The results show how different optimal reservoir release rules generate different trade-off solutions inherently involved in upstream and downstream users requirements and decisions. This study stimulates the research in this context by using simulation based optimization techniques to manage for security for food, water and energy generation, which leads to improve sustainability and long-term political stability.",

Due to their strong connection to aerosol chemical and microphysical characteristics, in situ measurements have been commonly used for evaluating optical properties routines in global and regional scale models. However, these in situ measurements, including size distribution and chemical composition data, can be subject to uncertainties. Techniques for obtaining these data depend on particle size (submicron versus supermicron) and relative humidity range (dry versus wet conditions). In this study, we examine how the data uncertainties can impact the level of agreement between the calculated and measured optical properties (commonly known as optical closure). Moreover, we put forth a novel technique for inferring in parallel the effective density and real refractive index of weakly absorbing aerosols from simultaneously measured size distributions (with mobility and aerodynamic sizes), and two optical properties, namely the scattering coefficient and hemispheric backscatter fraction, measured by integrating nephelometer. We demonstrate the performance of our technique, which permits discrimination between the retrieved aerosol characteristics of sub-micron and sub-10-micron particles, using both a sensitivity study with synthetically generated inputs with random noise and a six-week case study with real measurements. These measurements cover a wide range of coastal summertime conditions observed during the recent Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP,\nhttp://campaign.arm.gov/tcap/\n) and include periods with a wide range of aerosol loading and relative humidity. Finally, we discuss how in situ data and retrievals of aerosol characteristics can be applied for model evaluation. ",

The pore pressure, sediment particle size composition, microstructure, physical and mechanical properties at different depths inside the seabed were observed during the experimental process under the weight of the soil and under the action of waves of different heights. The results showed that wave-induced sediment responses significantly controlled the occurrence and evolution of inhomogeneity in the strength and sediment distribution of a uniform-originated silty seabed. The variations in the strength, composition and structure of during the wave-sediment interaction processes are closely related to the pore water seepage inside the seabed. The driving machanism can be devided into three modes: transient seepage caused by pore pressure oscillation, seepage failure caused by pore pressure accumulation and liquefaction failure caused by pore pressure accumulation, during which the latter is the main cause of vertical transport of pore water carrying a large amount of fine particles inside the seabed of the subaqueous Yellow River delta. The array of features observed in these experiments can be incorporated into a new model of seabed stratification in uniform-originated silty sediments during wave-sediment interaction. In addition, the implications of this model for traditional sedimentology are explored from a sediment dynamic perspective.",

            "abstract": "The Venice Lagoon represents an outstanding example of man-landscape co-existence, where salt marshes are currently exposed to possibly irreversible transformations due to the effects of climate changes and human activity. The increasing rate of relative sea level rise and the decreasing sediment supply are the dominant forcings controlling salt-marshes survival, as in other cases worldwide. Analysing signatures of landscape changes in the stratigraphic record is crucial to refine our knowledge of tidal landform dynamics and it is a first step to develop predictive morphodynamic models. The southern Venice lagoon is suited to analyze the response of tidal landscape to changes in environmental forcing. The upper part of the Holocene sedimentary succession accumulated as the effect of a “human-induced transgression”, which caused a considerable salt-marshes contraction since the 16th century. In the southern Venice lagoon, re-directions of the Brenta River during 16th and the 19th century caused significant changes in terms of freshwater and sediment supply. To analyze the paleomorphodynamic response to these main changes, we collected 25 cores (1.0 to 1.5 m deep) along a NE-SW linear transect about 5 km long cutting through salt-marsh, tidal-flat and subtidal-platform deposits. Through sedimentological analyses we defined the spatial arrangement of swamp, salt-marsh, wave-worked and tidal-flat mud deposits along this transect. Magnetic susceptibility and organic/inorganic content were measured in the study succession, which was dated through 14C and 137Cs geochronological analyses. Our results suggest that salt-marsh sedimentation occurred above deltaic deposits since the 14th century. Salt-marsh aggradation stemmed out from both mud settling and organic accumulation, although magnetic susceptibility revealed some intervals during which the inorganic deposition dominates over organic accumulation. Salt-marsh aggradation occurred in parallel with the decrease in salt-marsh extent and the tidal-flat expansion.",

There are studies on lay people’s perception of science and technology. However, what is the scientists’ perspective on public communication of science? Objectives - To describe and characterize the concepts that coordinators of Brazilian public health graduate programs have about public communication of science. Methods – This is an analytical and descriptive report of an exploratory research (doctoral study). The answers of fifty-one coordinators to two questionnaires were submitted for content analysis. The categories were transformed into variables that allowed the data processing by the Hiérarchique Classificatoire et Cohésitive (CHIC®) software. Results - Similarity analysis strongly suggested (0,99) that coordinators understand public communication as a communication directed to academic peers and students, also as a form of participation in scientific events and communication by scientific papers. Likewise, the implication analysis suggested a strong implication (0,98) between scientific communication understood as public communication. Conclusion - The notion of public communication of science as a social right and as a commitment and responsibility of researchers and research centers is not explicitly present in the narrative of the coordinators, although in general the coordinators conceive it as a relevant activity. This study thus contributes to a reflection on the role of scientists, researchers and research centers in public communication of science and technology.",

In this presentation we suggest that this may be a consequence of the action of kinetic scale ultra-low frequency electromagnetic field variations or kinetic Alfven waves and eigenmodes. We show how these waves originate in the plasma sheet and subsequently fill a large fraction of the inner magnetosphere during storm times. The amplitude of the eigenmodes can exceed 100 mV/m. These fluctuations have the capacity to break the traditional invariants constraining ion motion to drive very rapid energisation and heating of the ion plasma. We show how these waves can lead to large increases in particle pressure due to the extraction and continuous acceleration of oxygen ions from the ionosphere and injected ions from the plasma sheet. These waves present a new mechanism for enhancing the ring current that both observations and simulations indicate should be active during storm times.",

            "abstract": "Tropical Storm Irene generated devastating floods in New England in 2011, causing more than $500 million of damage. In intervening years, many geomorphic signs of disturbance have attenuated, suggesting that impacts may be ephemeral. Yet persistent impact continues: channel-proximal landslide scars linger as point sources of fine sediment 3 yrs post-Irene. We evaluate the legacy of this major disturbance while also testing conceptual models of hillslope-channel connectivity and subsequent downstream sediment routing. We measure sustained landslide erosion by comparing DEMs generated by a Terrestrial Laser Scanner and trace sediment mobility using in-channel measurements of embeddedness, sediment concentration, and fallout radionuclide activity. We augmented detailed temporal sampling of an 850 m2 landslide along a 2nd-order stream with a spatially robust summer 2014 field campaign, scanning an additional 12 landslides. The initially sampled landslide eroded 250 m3 of sediment between fall 2013 and May 2014, averaging 0.3 m of erosion with nearly all erosion occurring during a two-week spring snowmelt. Landslide sediments had high measured 7Be activity (t1/2=53.4 d), caused by subaerial exposure; sediment collected downstream of the landslide had higher 7Be activity than that collected upstream, suggesting landslide provenance. Channel sediment upstream of the landslide had remained in the channel long enough for 7Be to decay below detectable activity. Embeddedness, a measure of fine sediment on a channel bed, was higher downstream of the landslide than upstream. Remote sensing reveals >50 similar landslides within the White River alone, and hundreds more in Vermont. Thus, landslide scar inputs may continue to influence the regional fine sediment budget. Ongoing successive scans in multiple watersheds show erosion continues in summer, an observation corroborated by elevated suspended sediment concentrations downstream of landslides after rain events. Summertime erosion has generally been low, but one extreme storm triggered >4000 m3 of erosion on a 3500 m2 landslide along the 5th-order Williams River, averaging 1.3 m erosion across the landslide. Understanding the loci of affected reaches and the magnitude of the continued effect is critical in assessing the long-term legacy of extreme events.",

If Late Noachian Mars was “cold and icy”, how can one explain the origin and distribution of the extensive valley networks and abundant open basin lakes? Could periodic or catastrophic melting of highland ice sheets produce the observed features? Are there areas where the horizontally stratified hydrological system is breached to enable communication with the groundwater system below? Would such scenarios lead to habitable environments? Analogs of aqueous environments and biological settings from the McMurdo Dry Valleys are combined with assessment of several top-down and bottom-up melting mechanisms for the Late Noachian Icy Highlands to outline predictions for the location and duration of potential habitable environments. Explored are 1) the volumes of ice available and the possibility that ice distribution and thickness are “supply-limited”, 2) the areal distribution of available ice, 3) the total amount of meltwater necessary to account for the observed features, 4) the predicted duration of aqueous production and longevity of aqueous environments under different melting scenarios, 5) the predicted geomorphic features formed by these mechanisms, and 6) similarities of these predicted features to the distribution and morphologic/morphometric characteristics of observed valley networks and open-basin lakes. The results are interpreted in the context of known habitable environments in the Mars-like hyperarid, hypothermal McMurdo Dry Valleys, comparing and assessing the locations of meltwater production and biological activity, the stratification of the hydrological system, and communication with the groundwater system below. Predictions are made for remote sensing signatures of these environments that might be recognized on Mars as candidates for ExoMars and Mars 2020 landing sites.\n ",

            "abstract": "The Qaidam Basin is a largest closed basin in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau which is now under hyperarid climate. A 938.5 m-long core was drilled in the Qahansilatu depression in the western Qaidam Basin with an average core recovery rate of 95%. It consists of lacustrine grayish mudstone and siltstones with upperward increasing interbedded salt layers. High resolution paleomagnetic and OSL-U/Th dating of the core determine the core formed between 2.77 Na and 0.1 Ma. Detailed examinations of lithofacies, evaporative minerals, carbon and oxygen isotopes, grain size, bioproductivity and redox conditions collectively reveal that the climate was dry since 2.77Ma and became intensively dried at about 2.5 Ma, 2.2 Ma, 1.6 Ma, 1.2 Ma, 0.9 Ma, 0.6 Ma and 0.1 Ma. Accompanying this stepwise aridifications is the phased shrinkage of the paleo-Qaidam lake from the semi-deep brackish lake in early stage via shallow brackish lake and perennial saline lake to playa saline lake in late stage and completely dried out at the end. Episodic global cooling and tectonic uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau are possible forcing.",

By using a 3-D hybrid plasma solver, we have varied the induced magnetic dipole responses due to the time-varying magnetic field of the Jovian magnetosphere corresponding to the C3 and C9 flybys by Galileo. The internal conductivity of Callisto has been set to match the induced dipole response. The model is thus including the physics of a time-varying magnetic field and the dynamics of the magnetospheric plasma.

Samples from 67 locations were extracted from shallow snow pits and analyzed for trace elements, black carbon (see Polashenski et al. and Dibb et al. in session C004: Aerosols and the Cryosphere), and snow grain size (in terms of specific surface area) at depths comprising at least the previous year’s worth of snow accumulation at each site. In addition, surface characteristics of the snow including albedo, surface roughness and meteorological forcing were determined. Here, we present the spatial distribution of grain size reported as specific surface area determined from field measurements using the Takuvik International Laboratory DUal Frequency Integrating Sphere for Snow Specific area measurement (DUFISSS) instrument and from laboratory-based stereology and micro-CT measurements from snow samples that were preserved and shipped back to the lab. Grain sizes from 2014 are compared to 2013 results at coincident locations and comparable depths, and compared to the intervening year’s worth of meteorological data from Automated Weather Stations (AWSs) assembled by the SAGE field team at four locations along the 2013 and 2014 routes.",

            "abstract": "The East African rift valley contains an outstanding record of hominin fossils that document human evolution over the Plio-Pleistocene when the global and regional climate and the rift valley itself changed markedly. The sediments of fossil localities typically provide, however, only short time windows into past climatic and environmental conditions. Continuous, long-term terrestrial records are now becoming available through core drilling to help elucidate the paleoenvironmental context of human evolution. Here we present a 500,000 year long high-resolution drill core record obtained from a key fossil and archeological site – the Olorgesailie Basin in the southern Kenya Rift Valley, well known for its sequence of archeological and faunal sites for the past 1.2 million years. In 2012 two drill cores (54 and 166 m long) were collected in the Koora Plain just south of Mt. Olorgesailie as part of the Olorgesailie Drilling Project (ODP) to establish a detailed climate and ecological record associated with the last evidence of Homo erectus in Africa, the oldest transition of Acheulean to Middle Stone Age technology, and large mammal species turnover, all of which are documented in the Olorgesailie excavations. The cores were sampled at the National Lacustrine Core Facility. More than 140 samples of tephra and trachytic basement lavas have led to high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating. The cores are being analyzed for a suite of paleoclimatic and paleoecological proxies such as diatoms, pollen, fungal spores, phytoliths, ostracodes, carbonate isotopes, leaf wax biomarkers, charcoal, and clay mineralogy. Sedimentological analyses, including lithological descriptions, microscopic smear slide analysis (242 samples), and grain-size analysis, reveal a highly variable sedimentary sequence of deep lake phases with laminated sediments, diatomites, shallow lake and near shore phases, fluvial deposits, paleosols, interspersed carbonate layers, and abundant volcanic ash deposits. Magnetic susceptibility indicates climatic variation potentially related to precessional cycles.",

APECS is a scientific, non-profit organization with free individual membership that aims to stimulate research collaborations and develop effective future leaders in polar research, education, and outreach.\nAPECS grew out of the 4th International Polar Year (2007-08), which emphasized the need to stimulate and nurture the next generation of scientists in order to improve the understanding and communication of the polar regions and its global connections. The APECS organizational structure includes a Council and an elected Executive Committee that are supported by a Directorate. These positions are open to all individual members through a democratic process. The APECS Directorate is funded by the Norwegian Research Council, the University of Tromsø and the Norwegian Polar Institute and is hosted by the University of Tromsø.\nEarly career scientists benefit from a range of activities hosted/organized by APECS. Every year, numerous activities are run with partner organizations and in conjunction with major polar conferences and meetings. In-person and online panels and workshops focus on a range of topics, from developing field skills to applying for a job after graduate school. Career development webinars are hosted each fall and topical research webinars are hosted throughout the year and archived online (http://www.apecs.is). The APECS website also contains abundant information on polar news, upcoming conferences and meetings, and job postings for early career scientists.\nTo better respond to members’ needs, APECS has national/regional committees that are linked to the international overarching organization. Many of these committees organize regional meetings or informal meet-ups, providing a means to personally interact with a subset of APECS’ 4725 members. The combination of in-person and online activities and resources hosted/organized by APECS provides members with unique opportunities for networking, career development, and international and interdisciplinary collaboration.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis of the δ13C composition of sedimentary organic matter from Euramerican Carboniferous successions indicates there are significant shifts in δ13C through this key time interval. Our studies have revealed that, at an individual location, the source and delivery mechanism of the sediment contribute to the type of organic matter preserved and, in turn this influences the measured δ13C values from bulk sedimentary organic matter of organic matter. In general, where marine-derived organic matter is dominant in these Carboniferous successions then δ13C values are characteristically lower compared to the higher values encountered where terrestrial plant-derived material is most abundant. The implication of these observations is that an apparent carbon isotope excursion identified from the bulk organic matter may reflect a change in transport processes, or depositional environment, rather than a perturbation in the global carbon cycle. In our most recent studies, however, we compare δ13C values from specific wood fragments and bulk sedimentary organic matter from non-marine, marine basinal, and marine shelfal successions from the earliest Mississippian through to the early Pennsylvanian. These data indicate that early Mississippian δ13C of organic matter is far less negative (around –22%0) than material of Late Mississippian age (around –26%0), however by the early Pennsylvanian, δ13C values return to –22%0. There are some δ13C data from brachiopod carbonate from this time interval and similar shifts are indicated. Our data are beginning to address whether we can identify a primary carbon cycle signal from the Carboniferous record using δ13C from a range of sedimentary environments. If we can, there are still questions around what the record is telling us about the global carbon cycle during a period when plant groups, including lycopods and seed ferns, rapidly diversified.",

Gridded historical weather and downscaled climate projections are now available for the Conterminous US at 800 meter monthly and 12 kilometer daily resolution and even finer resolution regionally. Combined, the high volume and unfamiliar file formats of these data make using it a challenge for all but the most determined or technologically savvy users. The U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) in cooperation with the many federal, academic, and open-source software partners, has been working to make base datasets and useful summaries available in formats that are readily usable by scientists and managers familiar with GIS and modeling of landscape-phenomena.\nWhen an analyst needs information such as decadal average growing degree day estimates for historical and future periods, she shouldn’t have to download and process terabytes of historical and projected data to produce a few summary values, or a simple map. A USGS project, known as the Geo Data Portal (GDP), has assembled a catalog of web-service available gridded climate datasets at the USGS, NASA, NOAA and several universities. GDP processing services provide model-ready spatially summarized gridded time series data for user-submitted polygons for any dataset in the catalog or any dataset published using supported open standards. Recently, progress has been made toward providing annual climate indices from monthly and daily data in common GIS formats.\nUsing the GDP system, a person can execute processing tasks that run on USGS servers and use custom datasets, statistic types, and statistic thresholds. This work has been made possible by numerous organizations committed to publishing software and data that scale well, use standards, and are freely available for anyone to use. A high-level overview of assembling the Geo Data Portal system’s capabilities will be presented, reflecting on technical and strategic difficulties experienced, and the future of open data and processing between the climate and landscape domains.",

            "abstract": "Partial melting occurs along grain boundaries and migrates through porous flow, leading to magma segregation in the mantle. Solitary porosity waves created by a perturbation in melting have been studied in the flow of a low viscosity fluid in a deformable matrix (McKenzie 1984, Scott and Stevenson 1986, Barcilon and Richter 1986, Spiegelman 1993, Wiggins and Spiegelman 1995). However, in a fairly complicated multi-physics, multi-scale process of magma migration, the geometry and instability of porosity waves can be affected by both mechanical and thermal factors, leaving different propagation signatures. In this work we develop a two-dimensional, two-phase damage model of magma-fracturing, and study the influence of viscosities and damage (void generation and microcracking) on the geometry properties of porosity waves. We first benchmark our solitary solutions with previous works and solve 2-D finite-amplitude waves numerically using spectral and semi-spectral method. We show that damage, decompaction weakening of the matrix and porosity-driven viscosities can alter the geometry of stable porosity waves, and result in an elongated or flattened wave front with a trail of smaller porosity. Such trails may localize subsequent waves and form porosity passage in the matrix. Scaling analysis of the time-dependent porosity waves are conducted and amount of magma reaching to the top of the melting region are estimated. Future work will include evaluating the thermal and seismic signatures during and after melt migration in two-phase porous flow.",

            "abstract": "Highly evolved, silica-rich lavas have been recovered from several different locations along the global MORB system. Petrographic and geochemical data from basalt, andesite (52-55 % SiO2), and dacite (56-59 % SiO2) glasses collected on the East Pacific Rise from 8°-15°50’N, give insight into the petrogenesis and eruption characteristics of these highly silicic melts. Although most geochemical variability in MOR basalts is commonly attributed to either low-pressure fractional crystallization of mantle derived melts or to a small degree of partial melting from a hydrated gabbro, the chemical anomalies in the trace element and isotopic abundances in the dacite and andesite samples at 8°37’N suggest that these lavas have had a more complicated petrogenesis. Andesite and dacite samples are characterized by significantly elevated Ce, Nd, Yb, Zr, Sr, and Ba concentrations. Coeval basaltic glasses from this region are typically “N-type” and “E-type”. The 8°37-8°39’N andesite glasses are predominantly phaneritc, with xenocrystic-clots of plagioclase commonly having discontinuous, oscillatory reverse zoning that vary from An57 to An77. Several of the samples contain gabbroic xenoliths composed of rounded olivines, euhedral clinopyroxene, and plagioclase xenocrysts with sieve textures. The composition of olivine xenocrysts from the andesitic glasses ranges from Fo77 to Fo81. Dacite glasses from 8°-15°50’N are unanimously aphyric with sparse micro-xenocrysts. The composition of plagioclase grains varies from An47 to An66. Olivine xenocrysts from the 9°03’N locality average Fo67 for their composition. However, the dacite glasses on the west portion of the 8°37’N 1-2 km offset are characterized by phaneritic samples with basaltic xenoliths that contain spherulitic-clots of plag/ol/cpx. Geochemical and petrologic modeling of the andesite and dacite lavas suggests that they are derived by the partial melting (3-5%) of a hydrated basaltic/gabbroic crust. Furthermore, the phase chemistry and textural relationships of the xenocrystic-clots in the high silica glasses suggests these melts were rapidly transported to the eruptions sites with little interaction with the existing basaltic plumbing system.",

We examined how ecosystem carbon gas exchange varies along a salinity gradient (0-32 ppt) in three marshes along an estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA. Midday net ecosystem exchange (where a negative rate indicates net carbon assimilated through photosynthesis) was greatest at the most freshwater site (4.8 ± 0.3 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1), followed by the saline (2.8 ± 1.0 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) and brackish (1.4 ± 0.6 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) sites. However, net ecosystem exchange integrated diurnally revealed each marsh to be a net CO2 source to the atmosphere as a result of high ecosystem respiration with no significant difference across the fresh (105.5 ± 28.9 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1), brackish (100.1 ± 36.5 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1), and salt marsh (78.3 ± 28.6 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1) sites. The large loss of carbon from these ecosystems is suggested to be a contributing factor to the disappearances of marshes in the region. Fifty percent of coastal Alabama wetlands, for examples, have disappeared from 1780 to 1980, and between 1955 and 1979 the percent loss (29%) in the region has exceeded the national average by a factor of three. While future warming is not expected to impact carbon assimilation significantly, our warming simulations suggest that carbon loss in these ecosystems can be enhanced by 12 to 26%, potentially exasperating the loss of marshes in the region.",

            "abstract": "Electrickinetic(EK) is a promising remediation technology because of its capability to remediate soils with low permeability. It has been used for heavy metals and organic pollutant(OPs) contaminated soils. As the most OPs are poor solubility and strong sorption capacity, combined EK technology is usually used, for example, EK combined with surfactants. Numerous combined EK tests are done in one-dimension(1D) column, however, it is proved that there is a big gap between 1D tests and field application. The objectives of this study are to investigate the remediation efficiency and EK behavior of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene(1,2,4-TCB) contaminated clay enhanced by surfactants in a three-dimension reactor with 28cm length×15cm width×16cm height. 1,2,4-TCB was one of the main contaminants at a field site in Nanjing, China, where the polluted soils are clay. Soil filled in EK cell was divided into six layers in depth, and each layer was divided into six parts in length and three parts in width. There were 108 specimens in total which realized 3D monitoring the effects of EK. Triton X-100(Exp1) and Tween80(Exp2) dissolved in NaCO3/NaHCO3 buffer respectively, were used as the anode purging solution. The distributions of soil pH and water content showed that the buffer was sufficient to neutralize H+ produced at anode and the direction of electroosmotic flow(EOF) remained constant. Exp2 generated a higher EOF than Exp1, but remediation efficiencies were not satisfactory so far. The concentration of 1,2,4-TCB in soil reached a peak and nadir in the normalized distances of 0.75 and 0.9 from cathode after 5 days, respectively. The 1,2,4-TCB concentration in the peak was almost twice as much as the initial concentration. It suggested that 1,2,4-TCB was desorbed from soil by surfactants and was transported from anode to cathode by EOF, which proved the capability of EK with surfactants to move 1,2,4-TCB in clay. The concentration of 1,2,4-TCB in the normalized distances of 0.01~0.06 from cathode were almost unchanged in different depths, suggesting that EK with surfactants had little effect on those regions. A follow-up study will try to improve the remediation efficiency, for example, increasing test duration, optimizing test conditions, enhancing solubility and mobility of 1,2,4-TCB and better controlling soil pH and current.",

For example, 10% of the water footprint of Chinese consumers is outside China; in the US this is 20%, and in the UK even 75%. National consumption thus always depends, partly, on water resources outside the national territory. Earlier research has resulted in global water footprint maps for all countries in the world, showing for each country where in the world water resources are being consumed and polluted in relation to consumption within the country considered. Recent research shows at a high spatial and temporal resolution level in which catchments in the world, the blue water footprint exceeds the maximum sustainable blue water footprint. The current study overlays the global water footprint maps per country with the global map showing locations of unsustainable water use in order to estimate, per country, the dependence of national consumption on unsustainable water footprints. Countries are ranked according to their fraction of their water footprint that is unsustainable and an in-depth analysis of the implications of this dependence is carried out for the top-10 of the list. The in-depth analysis explores which commodities are behind the unsustainable parts of a country’s water footprint, where these footprints are located and what options a country has to reduce its dependence on unsustainable water use.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a well-known tool to measure porosity and pore size distribution for high-permeability rocks at laboratory and at downhole conditions. In low (nanoDarcy) permeability rocks, although downhole tools lack the resolution to measure small pores, low-field laboratory instruments are able to measure fast relaxation times (down to 40-60 µs) and can be used as to assess their porosity and pore size distributions. However, the full potential of NMR data to measure small, µm-sized pores is undervalued. It remains unclear whether NMR transverse relaxation (T2) distributions represent the entire pore structure in low-permeability rocks. In this study, we discuss important acquisition parameters for reliable NMR measurement in mudrocks. We present the challenges and limitations of NMR data inversion and interpretation by simulating the echo train data for two synthetic rocks, a sandstone and a mud rock. We show examples of analytical solutions for simplified geometries to investigate the contribution of different relaxation mechanisms on T2distributions in nanometer-sized pores and to understand NMR diffusion measurements.\nOur results for mud rocks show that even data with high signal to noise ratio fail to capture fast relaxation of the hydrogen nuclei in small pores and, consequently, do not measure the multi-modal pore size distributions. NMR data do capture the dominant pore size range through logarithmic average of the time distribution that is independent of signal to noise ratio and inversion algorithm. Analytical solutions of T2relaxations in mud rocks shows that the response is dominated by the surface relaxation. Diffusion induced relaxation, even at high magnetic susceptibility contrasts, is not significant. Analytical modeling of diffusion coefficient, assuming Gaussian phase distribution, reveals that diffusion of spins in nano-meter pore sizes requires a very large applied gradient for the spins to diffuse. The results of this work lead us to a better understanding of the NMR response in mudrocks and consequently the complex pore structure of low-permeability rocks.",

            "abstract": "The NASA/GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) project produces shortwave and longwave surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes for the 1983-near present time period. Temporal resolutions are 3-hourly, 3-hourly-monthly, daily, and monthly. Spatial resolution is 1 degree. The current release 3.0 (available at gewex-srb.larc.nasa.gov) uses the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) DX product for pixel level radiance and cloud information. This product is subsampled to 30 km, resulting in pixel counts of ~10 per grid box. ISCCP is currently recalibrating and recomputing their entire data series, to be released as the HX product, at 10km resolution. The large increase in pixel number will allow SRB greater flexibility in its own spatial resolution, allowing a higher resolution gridded product (e.g. 0.5 degree), as well as the production of pixel-level fluxes. Additionally, the SRB team is collaborating with other global GEWEX energy flux teams to improve key inputs such as the inclusion of an aerosol history, meteorological, and ozone data sets. For instance, the aerosol history will be specified from the first version of the Max-Planck-Institut Aerosol Climatology (MAC) containing a climatological coarse mode and an emission based fine mode history.\nHere we present our first look at results for the improved GEWEX Shortwave and Longwave algorithm (GSW and GLW) with new ISCCP data, the various other improved input data sets and the incorporation of many additional internal SRB model improvements. Improvements in GSW include the incorporation of variable composition aerosol from the MAC data set, an expansion of the number of wavelength bands is expanded from five to eighteen, and the inclusion of ice cloud vs. water cloud radiative transfer. The GLW improvements include the MAC aerosol vertical profiles, meteorology from HIRS, diurnally varying sea surface and land surface temperatures, and new topography, surface type, and snow/ice fields.\nThe SRB data produced will be released as part of the Release 4.0 Integrated Product, recognizing the interdependence of the radiative fluxes with other GEWEX products providing estimates of the Earth's global water and energy cycle (I.e., ISCCP, SeaFlux, LandFlux, NVAP, etc.). The current schedule of this new data set is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The study of the main pathways of carbon flux from the deep Earth requires the analysis of a large quantity and variety of data on volcanic and non-volcanic gas emissions. Hence, there is need for common frameworks to aggregate available data and insert new observations.\nSince 2010 we have been developing the Mapping Gas emissions (MaGa) web-based database to collect data on carbon degassing form volcanic and non-volcanic environments. MaGa uses an Object-relational model, translating the experience of field surveyors into the database schema. The current web interface of MaGa allows users to browse the data in tabular format or by browsing an interactive web-map. Enabled users can insert information as measurement methods, instrument details as well as the actual values collected in the field. Measurements found in the literature can be inserted as well as direct field observations made by human-operated instruments.\nCurrently the database includes fluxes and gas compositions from active craters degassing, diffuse soil degassing and fumaroles both from dormant volcanoes and open-vent volcanoes from literature survey and data about non-volcanic emission of the Italian territory. Currently, MaGa holds more than 1000 volcanic plume degassing fluxes, data from 30 sites of diffuse soil degassing from italian volcanoes, and about 60 measurements from fumarolic and non volcanic emission sites. For each gas emission site, the MaGa holds data, pictures, descriptions on gas sampling, analysis and measurement methods, together with bibliographic references and contacts to researchers having experience on each site.\nFrom 2012, MaGa developments started to be focused towards the framework of the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing research initiative of the Deep Carbon Observatory.\nWhithin the DECADE initiative, there are others data systems, as EarthChem and the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program. An interoperable interaction between the DECADE data systems is being planned.\nMaGa is showing good potentials to improve the knowledge on Earth degassing firstly by making data more accessible and encouraging participation among researchers, and secondly by allowing to observe and explore, for the first time, a gas emission dataset with spatial and temporal extents never analyzed before.",

The related instabilities are usually classified as having sheet-like or drip-like morphologies. The former is associated with whole lithosphere (subduction) or delamination type foundering such as suggested for beneath the southern Sierra-Nevada and the Colorado Plateau, the latter to classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability below an upper layer, suggested to have occurred beneath the Tibetan Plateau and North Island, New Zealand. This dichotomy is non-trivial; classification of phenomena into one or the other is often debated and is difficult to infer from observables. The two morphologies are most likely end-members. Here I refine the dynamics driving morphology selection as a function of rheological lamination and boundary layer Rayleigh number in 2D and 3D, using the finite-element particle-in-cell code Underworld. I explore the influence of morphology on mass flux, topography and crustal deformation as well as deviation from classic 2D scalings. Additionally, tectonic displacement interference with instability development is discussed using basic 3D shear-box style models. By quantifying and describing the theoretical instability dynamics which could result in a plausible range of morphological expressions, I aim to build a general framework which can be paired to the discussion involving firstly, the recognition of varied styles of body force instabilities in the modern Earth and rock record and secondly, to what degree pattern selection impacts boundary layer mass and energy flux.",

            "abstract": "Fluvio-deltaic deposits result from the interplay of upstream and downstream environmental conditions, such as upstream tectonic and downstream sea-level settings, making them prime records of past environments. Environmental conditions are far from static, and changes to these conditions create perturbations, or signals, that can propagate from both the upstream hinterlands and from the downstream receiving basin to the fluvio-deltaic realm. Our ability to interpret past environmental conditions from fluvio-deltaic deposits thus hinges on our understanding of fluvio-deltaic response to, and preservation of, environmental perturbations. Recent work suggests the internal dynamics of fluvio-deltaic systems can modify or completely destroy these signals, making them difficult or impossible to interpret from the sedimentary deposits. It has been shown that such signal modification or destruction is a function of both the signal timescales and system response timescales. However, it remains unclear which aspects of the fluvio-deltaic system most significantly control the interaction of these timescales and the extent to which the environmental signals are ultimately preserved in the deposits. To answer these questions, we numerically simulate fluvio-deltaic growth using a physics-based source-to-sink model of sediment transfer from upland source areas to coastal depositional basins. Preliminary results demonstrate that grain size and length scales of the fluvial system affect propagation of both tectonic and sea-level forcings, as well as the preservation style of the resulting signal in the architecture of the fluvio-deltaic deposits. Future work will focus on determining if these results are set by a relationship between grain size and fluvial system size with system response time.",

            "abstract": "A suite of ocean simulations are conducted at resolutions of 1 degree down to 1/36 degree using the MIT General Circulation Model, Regional Ocean Modeling System, and the Community Earth Systems Model. The 1 degree simulations in the CESM exhibit warm sea surface temperature biases (upwards of 8 C) from the Mid-Atlantic Bight through the Gulf of Maine. In a coupled climate simulation the bias can lead to misplaced heat fluxes which drastically reduce the fidelity of the climate simulation. These observed errors are typical of coarsely resolved ocean simulations and are directly linked to the improper location of the Gulf Stream. Thus, determing a the cause of this error requires a detailed study of a more well-behaved numerical Gulf Stream. 1/12 degree and 1/36 degree simulations show an improvement in the modelled Gulf Stream when compared with observations.\nAll of the simulations show an agreement in the leading balance in the barotropic vorticity budget within the Gulf Stream, dominantly between planetary vorticity advection and bottom pressure torques. This suggests that this inviscid balance is not the only requirement for proper Gulf Stream pathway, since this signature appears in the poorly separating scenario. However, it is shown that the free surface and baroclinic contributions to the bottom pressure torque largely cancel where the modelled Gulf Stream separates. This compensation is necessary for the transport and the upper layer Gulf Stream to cross the edge of the continental shelf. Scaling arguments owe this cancellation to the relative strength between the Gulf Stream and Deep Western Boundary Current. Hence, weak shear may not allow for the appropriate compensation to allow the transport to cross at Cape Hatteras where the bathymetric gradients are upwards of 20%. It is supposed that the sea surface temperature bias is directly caused by the weak vertical shear between the Gulf Stream and Deep Western Boundary Current which disallows decoupling from bathymetry at Cape Hatteras.",

            "abstract": "‘Leveraging Local Knowledge to Measure Greenland Fjords’ is a science project designed with local knowledge sharing and data collection at its core. Citizen Science can take many different forms but in each instance it incorporates active participation of the general public in science research through integrating outreach, instruction, information gathering and data exchange. The strongest projects focus on two-way information exchange with both the citizen scientist and the professional scientist learning when they share their knowledge.\nWorking in cooperation with both teachers and fishermen in a small local community in northwest Greenland, we collected novel oceanographic measurements from a small 5 m fishing boat in the local fjord. We established connections with the local school for developing education initiatives, sharing maps and other resources, and worked through the teachers to connect with the village residents. We hosted a community meeting to provide a forum for a two-way information exchange with the science team providing background on the research project and the local residents providing both narrative information on local environmental change over the last one to three decades, and more quantitative and immediately useful information on fjord depths, iceberg flow directions and timing of seasonal ice break up and move out.\nThe local fishermen were intimately familiar with the local environment, having intrinsically collected data on fjord depth from their regular lowering of fishing line to catch Greenlandic halibut, a benthic fish. For our first trip they worked with us locating the deep and shallow parts of the fjord from many seasons of watching icebergs ground on the shallow shoals, and showed us how to navigate into the ice packed glacial front through the dense ice mélange. The local community interest in the project and in learning how to use the equipment we had brought encouraged us to discuss a long-term data gathering relationship, with the fishermen at the center of the collection. They were interested in the findings, wanting to see how the water temperature might differ from surface to depth. The same data we are interested in for better understanding glacial change is data they seek to explain impacts they have seen in their own fishing and hunting over the last several decades.",

            "abstract": "Gold and arsenic incorporation into pyrite (FeS2) is strongly coupled in different types of ore deposits, including Carlin-type Au, porphyry Cu, epithermal Au, orogenic Au, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) and iron-oxide Cu-Au (IOCG), among others. Despite significant advances in the last decades, the fundamental factors controlling Au and As partition in pyrite from hydrothermal systems formed under different tectonic settings and crustal levels remain poorly known. Furthermore, the complexity of pyrite microtextures and growth features suggest multi-stage growth that may be useful to monitor changes in fluid composition related to episodic pumping of fluids.\nHere we report a comprehensive database of EMPA, SIMS, LA-ICP-MS and micro-PIXE Au-As analyses that cover temperature conditions of pyrite formation from ~30ºC to ~600ºC. The global pyrite Au-As data form a wedge-shaped zone in compositional space, and show that the solid solubility limit of Au in arsenian pyrite is independent of the geochemical environment of pyrite formation and rather depends on its crystal-chemical properties and post-depositional alteration. Compilation of Au-As concentrations and formation temperatures for pyrite indicates that Au and As solubility is retrograde in this mineral, as Au and As contents decrease with increasing temperature from ~200-500ºC.\nBased on these results, we define one Au-As trend formed by pyrites from Carlin-type and orogenic Au deposits where compositions are largely controlled by fluid-rock-interactions and can be highly perturbed by changes of temperature or subsequent alteration. The second trend consists of pyrites from porphyry Cu, epithermal Au deposits and geothermal systems, which are characterized by compositions that preserve the Au/As signature of mineralizing magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The well-developed oscillatory zoning in pyrite detected in these systems, where Cu-rich, Au-As-depleted growth zones alternate with Cu-poor, Au-As-rich layers, indicates that Cu is geochemically decoupled from As and Au. These data suggest that selective partitioning of metals into pyrite may be related to abrupt phase separation events and periodic changes in fluid composition, triggered by external forcing factors such as earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Ice-rafted biotite and hornblende grains from the Late Oligocene strata of Deep Sea Drilling Program Site 270 were analyzed for 40Ar/39Ar derived ages. Characteristic ages are found from both East and West Antarctica, indicating that both of these areas were glaciated and producing icebergs during a time when major West Antarctic glaciation was previously uncertain. Site 270 is located in the central Ross Sea on the southeastern flank of the Central High (77°26.48'S; 178°30.19'W). Approximately 36% of the grain population exhibits ages between 475 and 500 Ma, representing the Ross Orogeny and Transantarctic Mountains of East Antarctica. These ages are slightly older than the bedrock at the base of Site 270, which has been previously dated at 437 ± 6 Ma. Smaller populations of grains are clustered near 100, 200, and 350 Ma, all of which point to a West Antarctic contribution. While it has been previously thought that West Antarctic glaciation could have initiated during the Oligocene, it has remained inconclusive. Our data set presents the first geochemical provenance evidence of a glaciated West Antarctica during this time. We suggest the Ross Sea was not just influenced by the ice caps residing on the uplifted basement highs, but was already supporting the transport of ice bergs from the surrounding coastlines.",

The mean mass concentrations of eBC, PM2.5 and CO were recorded as 12.1±8.7µg/m3, 182.75±114.5µg/m3 and 3.41±1.6ppm respectively. Also, the Absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) was estimated from eBC and varied from 0.38 to 1.29 with mean value of 1.09±0.11. The frequency of occurrence of AAE was ~17% less than unity whereas ~83% was greater than unity. The mass concentrations of eBC were found to be higher by ~34% of the average value of eBC (12.1µg/m3) during the study period. Sources of eBC were estimated and they were ~ 94% from fossil fuel (eBCff) combustion whereas only 6% was from wood burning (eBCwb). The ratio between eBCff and eBCwb was fifteen which indicates a higher impact from fossil fuels compared to biomass burning. When comparing eBCff during day and night, a factor of three higher concentrations was observed in night-time than daytime, it is due to combustion of fossil fuel (diesel vehicle emission) and shallow boundary layer conditions. The contribution of eBCwb in eBC was higher in between 18.00 to 21.00 hrs due to burning of wood / biomass. A significant correlation between eBC and PM2.5 (r=0.78) and eBC and CO (r = 0.46) indicates the similarity in location sources. The mass concentration of eBC was highest (23.4μg/m3) during the month of December when the mean visibility (VIS) was lowest (1.31Km). Regression analysis among wind speed (WS), VIS, soot particles and CO were studied and significant negative relationships were seen as VIS and eBC (-0.65), eBCff (-0.66), eBCwb (-0.34) and CO (-0.65), however, in between WS among eBC (-0.68), eBCff (-0.67), eBCwb (-0.28) and CO (-0.53) respectively. The regression analysis indicated that emission of soot particles may be localized to fossil fuel combustion whereas wood/biomass burning emissions of black carbon are due to transportation from farther distances. Regression analysis between eBCff with CO (r=0.44) indicated a similar source as vehicular emissions. The very high loading of PM2.5 along with eBC over Delhi suggests that urgent action is needed to mitigate the emissions of carbonaceous aerosol in the northern part of India.",

            "abstract": "We present results from two geophysical investigations of the north of Ireland, one of a concealed sedimentary basin and the other of an area of pre- to mid-Cambrian metasedimentary material with local microseismicity in Donegal. Magnetotelluric data have been acquired over each area as part of the IRETHERM Project in order to assess potential low-enthalpy geothermal resources. In addition, airborne frequency-domain EM response data have been used to assist in the definition of near-surface electrical structure and constraint of magnetotelluric modeling.\nThe Rathlin Basin in Northern Ireland was identified as a potential geothermal resource due both an elevated geothermal gradient (observed in two deep boreholes) and favorable hydraulic properties in thick successions of Permian and Triassic sandstones (measured from core samples). Prior seismic experiments failed to fully image the sediments beneath the overlying flood basalt. A new experiment applying the magnetotelluric method has had more success, as the MT signal is not dissipated by the crystalline overburden. MT data were acquired at 69 sites across the north-eastern portion of the onshore Rathlin Basin and on nearby Rathlin Island in order to image the thickness, depth, and lateral continuity of the target sediments. Analyses and modeling of the data have determined a resistivity model that maps the variation in thickness of the sediment fill and the truncation of the sediments against the structurally-controlling Tow Valley Fault. Further testing of the model sensitivity to variations of the thickness of the Sherwood Sandstone Group within the sediment fill has also been performed, as the overlying sediments have lower porosities and permeabilities from core sampling.\nMicroseismicity in a metasedimentary area of northern Donegal suggests that secondary porosity distributions along fracture planes may have been augmented, leading to elevated electrical conductivity. MT data were acquired over the epicenter and surrounding of a M2.2 earthquake that occurred on 26/01/2012, with both audio-MT and broadband MT data acquired at 59 sites, and solely AMT data at the remaining 29 sites. Forward and inverse modeling of the data have been performed to search for fine conductive structures within the bedrock, as well as to model the general subsurface structure.",

            "abstract": "Erosional sequence boundaries and incised valleys buried in modern continental shelves represent the response of alluvial and coastal systems to Quaternary sea level oscillations. The study of the processes leading to valley incision reveals, at both regional and global scales, the influence of tectonics and eustatism on the evolution of fluvial landforms in coastal plains, while the sedimentary infill of the valley may represents one of the best archives to investigate past environmental changes. Although the time registered in the stratigraphic record represents only a small portion of the geological history, informations about the processes governing the evolution of past landscapes can be quantified by looking to erosional surfaces, where much of the time is condensed. The Manfredonia Incised Valley (southern Adriatic Sea), is a very interesting case of valley as it formed during a single episode of incision related to the last glacial sea level fall and was completely filled during the post-glacial sea level rise. The inverse-funnel shape of the incision, and its confinement toward the mid-inner shelf reveal the impact of the step-wise sea level fall on preexisting coastal morphologies, in particular during the MIS5-4 and MIS3-2 transitions. The 45 m thick sedimentary succession filling the valley recorded the post-glacial sea level rise, as revealed by the upward transition from fluvial to shallow-marine deposits, and the impact of base level and high-frequency climate change on river to coastal systems. The upper 15 m of infill, in particular, consist of multiple bayhead delta progradations occurred synchronously to the formation of sapropel S1, and represent the very-shallow water equivalent of the cm-thick sapropel layers accumulated offshore in the deeper southern Adriatic basin.",

Recent availability of accurately coregistered, radiometrically intercalibrated Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery collected since 1988 allows for synoptic scale ST analyses of vegetation phenology. We use multitemporal spectral mixture analysis of exoatmospheric reflectance to represent land cover and water bodies as continuous fields of soil and sediment substrates (S), vegetation (V), and dark surfaces (D; water & shadow). This study analyses 61 cloud-free Landsat acquisitions across two geographic scenes to identify ST patterns of winter cropping and interconversion between agricultural fields and ponds used for aquaculture. We also use MODIS 16-day EVI composite time series post-2000 and high spatial resolution imagery to extend and vicariously validate the Landsat-derived observations. We use temporal moment spaces (derived from temporal mean, standard deviation, and skewness) and temporal feature spaces (derived from spatial Principal Components) to characterize the full range of phenological patterns observed at 30 m scales throughout the lower delta. For each year with sufficient cloud-free coverage, we distinguish between areas with a high likelihood of use for aquaculture versus areas with a high likelihood of use for agriculture based on a combination of reflectance and phenology. From changes in these patterns we infer changes in land use on seasonal to interannual timescales. Many of the phenological patterns we observe occur on the scale of individual polders, suggesting decision making at community scales. While there appears to be considerable loss of agricultural land to aquaculture in many areas of the lower delta, we also observe intensification of dry season cropping in other areas. MODIS reveals frequent instances of both gradual and abrupt decreases in seasonal peak EVI as well as many localized instances of abrupt cessation of agriculture. In terms of area and magnitude, the single largest disturbance we observe immediately follows Cyclone Aila in 2009. We observe a band of phenological disruption on the polders along almost 400 km of the periphery of the Sundarbans.",

            "abstract": "Continental basins located along the European Atlantic volcanic passive margin are an increasingly important setting for hydrocarbon exploration. Several recent offshore and onshore studies in the Faroe-Shetland Basin have shown that many faults cut part, or all of the Palaeogene lava sequences together with the rocks in the underlying sedimentary basins. These lava-hosted faults have the potential to act both as fluid traps or migration pathways for hydrocarbon accumulations originating at depth below the volcanic pile. Mapping and structural analysis of calcite-mineralized fault sets developed in the Faroe Islands Basalt Group show systematic cross-cutting relationships, which can be fit to a relative chronology of deformation events that record a multi-phase rift-reorientation through time. The geometry and kinematics of structures recorded on the Faroe Islands indicate that they are coeval with the onset of segmented oceanic-spreading on the Reykjanes, Aegir, and Mohns ridges, currently dated at about 54-51 Ma. This age is regionally poorly constrained, utilizing relative ages of oceanic magnetochrons, in a region where magnetochrons are ambiguous. We present new age constraints for initial continental separation, using U-Pb geochronology of crack-seal calcite veins in the Faroe Islands. Calcite grains were selected for each rift-fault set, and analyzed using LA-ICP-MS. Samples were screened to find closed-system material with abundant uranium, and analyzed for alteration using BSE, CL and charge-coat imaging with an SEM. Initial results reveal that although rift-fault kinematics are consistent with the onset of oceanic spreading, the U-Pb ages are much younger than magnetochron (54 Ma) break-up ages, and imply that oceanic spreading had not established in the Faroes region of the margin until at least 45 Ma. This new data is consistent with models for a remnant continental land bridge linking Greenland and Eurasia well into the Eocene.",

Reanalysis datasets covering 1958–2001 are used as a substitute of observations and resampled by the weather generator to optimally fit prescribed linear temperature trends derived from the MPI-ESM CMIP5 simulations under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios.\nTo assess the related uncertainty, temperature trends from carefully selected best/worst ensemble members are considered. In addition, an extra projection is forced by observed temperature trends in 1958–2001. The following results are obtained: (i) Spatial average temperature will increase by 0.6°–0.9°C; the increase exceeds 1°C in all months except in boreal summer, thus indicating a reduced annual cycle; and daily minimum temperature rises faster than daily maximum temperature, resulting in a narrowing of the diurnal range of near-surface temperature. (ii) Precipitation increase mainly occurs in early summer and autumn possibly because of an earlier onset and later withdrawal of the Asian summer monsoon. (iii) Both frost and ice days decrease by 1–2 days in spring, early summer, and autumn, and the decrease of frost days on the annual course is inversely related to the precipitation increase. (iv) Degree-days increase all over the TP with peak amplitude in the Qaidam Basin and the southern TP periphery, which will result in distinct melting of the local seasonal frozen ground, and the annual temperature range will decrease with stronger amplitude in south TP.",

            "abstract": "Driftwood in rivers impact sediment transport, riverine habitat and human infrastructures. Quantifying it, in particular large woods on fairly large rivers where it can move easily, would allow us to improve our knowledge on fluvial transport processes. There are several means of studying this phenomenon, amongst which RFID sensors tracking, photo and video monitoring. In this abstract, we are interested in the latter, being easier and cheaper to deploy. However, video monitoring of driftwood generates a huge amount of images and manually labeling it is tedious. It is essential to automate such a monitoring process, which is a difficult task in the field of computer vision, and more specifically automatic video analysis. Detecting foreground into dynamic background remains an open problem to date.\nWe installed a video camera at the riverside of a gauging station on the Ain River, a 3500 km² Piedmont River in France. Several floods were manually annotated by a human operator. We developed software that automatically extracts and characterizes wood blocks within a video stream. This algorithm is based upon a statistical model and combines static, dynamic and spatial data. Segmented wood objects are further described with the help of a skeleton-based approach that helps us to automatically determine its shape, diameter and length.\nThe first detailed comparisons between manual annotations and automatically extracted data show that we can fairly well detect large wood until a given size (approximately 120 cm in length or 15 cm in diameter) whereas smaller ones are difficult to detect and tend to be missed by either the human operator, either the algorithm. Detection is fairly accurate in high flow conditions where the water channel is usually brown because of suspended sediment transport. In low flow context, our algorithm still needs improvement to reduce the number of false positive so as to better distinguish shadow or turbulence structures from wood pieces.",

            "abstract": "Debonding between casing and cement may create interfacial leakage pathways, compromising well integrity in CO2 storage systems. Our previous work on such debonding-defects showed that chemical reactions between cement, steel and CO2-fluids provide only limited potential for local reaction-induced sealing, allowing short-range defects to remain open. Changes in temperature and stress state may subsequently cause these defects to grow and connect, potentially forming long-range interfacial leakage pathways. This study investigates how CO2-induced reaction affects the transport properties of such interconnected defects by means of reactive flow-through experiments.\nMetre scale sections of debonded cement-casing interface were simulated using composite samples, prepared as follows. Cement was cast into steel tube coils (L 1.5–3.0 m, ø 6–8 mm). After curing, the coils were pressurized using water, causing the steel tube to deform permanently and lift off the cement, creating casing-cement samples that contain sections of (partially) debonded cement-steel interface.\nReactive flow-through experiments were performed in a permeameter, capable of running at temperatures (80°C ± 0.5 °C) and fluid pressures (10–12 MPa) representative for downhole environments. The coil samples were one-sidedly flooded with CO2-bearing fluid, continuously measuring apparent sample permeability and periodically sampling the downstream fluid. Additionally, post-experiment microstructural analyses were performed. Results show permeability decreases of several orders, indicating reactive-transport phenomena that occur on the metre scale contribute significantly to the sealing-potential. As such, our experiments can be used to understand the long-range behaviour of annuli in wells, beyond the commonly used lab-scale.",

            "abstract": "The Bohai Bay Basin (BBB) is a subsiding trough, which is located in northern China and bounded by outcropping Precambrian crystalline basement: to the north is the Yan Mountains, to the west the Taihang Mountains, to the southeast the Luxi Uplift, and to the east the Jiaodong Uplift and the Liaodong Uplift. It is not only cut through by famous right-lateral strike-slip fault, Tancheng-Lujiang Fault (TLF), but also rifled through by Zhangjiakou-Bohai Seismic Zone (ZBSZ). Its formation/evolution has close relation with continental dynamics, and is concerned greatly by Geoscientists. Although seismicity might shed light on this issue, there is no clear image of earthquake distribution in this region as result of difficulty in seismic observation of bay area.\nIn this paper, we employ Matched Filter Technique (MFT) to better understand the local seismicity. MFT is originally used to detect duplicated events, thus is not capable to find new events with different locations. So we make some improvement on this method. Firstly, we adopt the idea proposed by David Shelly et al. (Nature, 2007) to conduct a strong detection and a weak detection simultaneously, which enable us to find more micro-events. Then, we relocate the detected events, which provides us with more accurate spatial distribution of new events as well as the geometry of related faults, comparing with traditional MFT.\nResults show that the sites of some famous historical strong events are obviously the locations concentrated with microearthquakes. Accordingly, we detect/determine/discuss the accurate positions of the historical strong events in BBB employing the results of the modified MFT. Moreover, the earthquakes in BBB form many seismic zones, of which the strikes mostly near the one of TLF although they together form the east end of ZBSZ. In the 2014 AGU fall meeting, we will introduce the details of our results and their geodynamical significance.\n",

The Louisville Seamount trail displays age progressive volcanism thought to be formed as the Pacific plate moved over a hotspot. The older seamounts are located in the north (80 Ma, Osbourn Guyot) and younger seamounts to the south. Seamounts in this study are all guyots from the older section of the seamount trail (~74 Ma, Site U1372 at Canopus Guyot to ~51 Ma, Site U1377 at Hadar Guyot).\nSites U1372 and U1376 respectively recovered ~230 m and ~140 m of basaltic material beneath a thin sediment interface and contain many in-situ lava flows that are interlayed with volcaniclastics, breccias and intrusive sheets. 40Ar/39Ar measurements will be used to date these different lithologies and, along with paleomagnetic inclination data, determine whether there was post-erosional volcanism and postulate which processes are involved with either the construction or deconstruction of ocean islands. Koppers et al. (2012) noted that some holes had consistent paleomagnetic inclinations suggesting that at least the larger clasts in the volcaniclastic breccias were emplaced hot or otherwise had been reset post deposition. If this is the case and breccias were emplaced hot then this would explain the undetectable levels of CO2 remaining in glasses after a complete degassing of the lithologies (Nichols et al., 2014). This would further support evidence for shallow eruption depths and post-erosional volcanism. In addition, the 40Ar/39Ar ages should be able to resolve whether or not the breccias were emplaced during the same time period as underlying and overlying intrusive sheets.\nSamples were analyzed using a high-resolution incremental step-heating method at Oregon State University in the Geochronology Lab using a Thermo Scientific ARGUS-VI Noble Gas Multicollector Mass Spectrometer.

            "abstract": "The quantification of the role of weathering in the carbon cycle and its interaction with climate and tectonics at the geological time scale is one of the key questions of the geoscientists. The consumption of atmospheric CO2 by silicate weathering indisputably plays the central role in the long term carbon budget and consequently on mean global climate. Through the composition of major elements in river waters, CO2 consumption by the alteration of continental rocks can be estimated.\nThe aim of this study is to estimate of the chemical weathering rate of the Zambesi basin and the impact of Karoo basalt province on chemical atmospheric consumption, evaluated from a database of major elements. The Karroo basalts outcrop erupted around 183 +/2 2 106 take place in the Upper and the Middle Zambezi, covering a surface of 9600 km2. The Zambesi Basin, located between 8° and 20° south latitude and between 16.5 and 36 east longitude, is the fourth largest in Africa. The catchment has a total area of some 1,281,000 km2, the mean annual temperature is 19,3°C and the annual rainfall varies from nearly 2 000 mm to 600 mm. During the sampling period, the annual runoff at Victoria Fall gauging Station ranged between 50 to 2000 m3/s ie 6.9 to 0.6 l/s/km2. The consumption rate of atmospheric CO2 associated with the chemical weathering was calculated from riverine HCO3- concentrations. During the weathering of volcanic rocks, all dissolved carbonates originate from atmospheric/sil CO2. Values of CO2 consumption rates are relatively high, about 0.024 1012 mol/yr, and are comparable to Deccan Traps consumption rates.",

            "abstract": "The southern Norwegian Rogaland Igneous Complex (RIC) intruded into post-Sveconorwegian granulite facies crust between 930 and 920 Ma. It includes three massif anorthosites, several small leuconorite bodies and the ~7km thick norite-quartz mangerite layered Bjerkreim-Sokndal (BKS) intrusion. The intrusion consists of five rhythmic mega-units created by repeated magma influxes capped by a transition zone and a thick sequence of more evolved mangerites and quartz mangerites. Over 70 paleomagnetic sites have been collected in the BKS, sampling all the mega-cyclic subunits and overlying mangerites. Remanence within the BKS is held in hemo-ilmenite-only rocks (lower parts of the mega-cyclic units), mixed hemo-ilmenite and magnetite rocks (upper parts of the lower mega-cyclic units) and magnetite only rocks in the upper highest mega-cyclic unit and overlying mangerites. Due to the different oxides present magnetic susceptibility varies over four orders of magnitude with a bimodal distribution (mean susceptibility of 6.4 x 10-3 SI for hemo-ilmenite rocks, and 8.9 x 10-2 SI for magnetite rocks). NRM values do not show a strong bimodal distribution as many of the rocks lacking magnetite have hemo-ilmenite with strong lamellar magnetism; average NRM for the entire suite is 8.83 A/m. All sites within the cyclic part of the intrusion have stable remanence and produce well-clustered site means. Samples from the upper mangerite rocks, dominated by MD magnetite, are often unstable and not all sites provide acceptable data. Mean directions for 66 sites spanning the entire intrusion are I = -73.7°, D = 303.7°, with α95  = 3.6° and k = 24. The resulting pole position is at 36.1°S and 217.5°E, with a paleolatitude for this part of Baltica of 59.7°S. Examination of the magnetic mineralogy combined with geochronology for RIC rocks yields an age of magnetization of ~900 Ma. Metamorphic country rocks yield similar directions at least 10 km from the contact, confirming the presence of a contact aureole around the intrusion. Comparison to other early Neoproterozoic paleomagnetic poles from southern Scandinavia confirms the high southern latitude position of Baltica at this time. A paucity of ~900 Ma poles from other ancient cratons precludes a more detailed picture of Rodinia in the early Neoproterozoic.",

            "abstract": "Surface-atmosphere energy exchanges control the ablation of snow and ice dominated regions. Although some of the input variables for surface energy balance (SEB) models can be estimated with reasonable accuracy using extrapolated data, remote sensing or meteorological models, estimates of other variables are still difficult, especially across glacierised catchments and at high elevations. Despite the existence of large uncertainties in the forcing variables, ablation amounts are usually simulated by glacio-hydrological models using only deterministic inputs. This is the case for advanced SEB models, which use large amounts of input data, or conceptual models e.g. based on temperature index methods, which rely on the transferability in space and time of empirical parameters.\nIn this work, we present an approach to explicitly calculate the uncertainty transferred from input variables to energy fluxes and ablation amounts of SEB simulations. For this, we parameterize the probability density functions (pdfs) of the SEB results. We code a point scale SEB model that calculates radiative, turbulent and internal heat fluxes. The model also includes a blowing snow sublimation module to determine mass losses to the atmosphere within the saltation and suspension layers. Using the SEB model, we perform extensive numerical simulations (>2*106 model runs) and obtain results of melt and sublimation within a-priori defined ranges of the input variables. These ranges are relatively wide in order to be representative of highly variable high-elevation conditions. After this, we fit theoretical pdfs to the input and outputs variables of the SEB model and obtain the distribution parameters. Using these results and a Bayesian scheme, we can compute the pdf of each output variable of the SEB as a function of the available (usually limited) information at a particular study site. In order to identify the most relevant information for each output variable, we also show the results of a global sensitivity analysis of the SEB model. The approach is tested using field measurements in the Chilean Andes and the Nepalese Himalaya. The presented method is shown to be effective on the calculation of energy fluxes, and melt and sublimation amounts, explicitly computing their uncertainty using a computationally parsimonious approach.",

            "abstract": "With the implementation of the South African National Water Act (NWA) currently underway, water intensive sectors, such as the irrigated agriculture sector, can expect reduced water allocations and an increase in water prices. Water footprints (WFs) are increasingly being recognised as a meaningful way by which to represent human appropriation of water resources.\nThis study examines the green and blue WFs of a variety of citrus cultivars in the lower Sundays River Valley, Eastern Cape, South Africa. WFs were calculated across dry, humid and long-term average climates and comparisons were made to available global average benchmark WFs. An number of indicators were also explored including; water productivity (ton/m3), economic land productivity (R/ha) and economic water productivity (R/m3) across all three climatic years. Most applications of WF sustainability assessments have focused on examining physical water scarcity as a measure for determining environmental hotspots. This study, therefore, also calculates the marginal product value for the irrigation water using a non-parametric linear programming approach. Marginal product value of irrigation water is not only useful in assisting with water-allocation decision making, but also useful in demonstrating the effects of resource depletion and degradation, and is therefore a useful measure for determining economic water scarcity.\nThe study highlights that both farmers and governments could reduce blue WF’s through adopting measures to increase water efficiency and considering economic water and land productivity. It also demonstrates the importance of including both environmental and economic scarcity indicators into water management and planning strategies, and the importance of conducting WF assessments using more accurate, site specific data.",

We have first examined the matrix effect associated with variable salinity (0 to 5 wt.% NaCl), and found that above 1 wt.% NaCl, the intensity of REE in ICP-MS measurement is drastically reduced due to the matrix effect. Accordingly, we have diluted the sample waters to contain ~0.6 wt.% NaCl, and then analyzed them by the standard addition method. The result shows that the abundance is appreciably high compared to near-surface waters, and exhibits almost a flat DMM-normalized pattern, which can be explained by mixing of a slab-derived fluid at relatively low temparature (400 to 500 ºC) and a near-surface water. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of the brine are consistent with the above interpretation on REEs, in that the deep brine is isotopically similar to a slab-derived fluid of the subducted Philippine Sea slab. These evidences suggest that the slab-derived fluid is upwelling even in the non-volcanic region possibly through a fault zone along the tectonic line.",

            "abstract": "The relationships between ENSO and the East Asian-western North Pacific monsoon during ENSO mature winter and decaying summer are studied by examining the pre-industrial control runs of 18 global climate models (GCMs) that participated in the phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In the observation, the tropical western North Pacific (WNP) is dominated by an anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) during El Niño (La Niña) mature winter, referred to as WNPAC (WNPC). WNPAC is asymmetric with WNPC. Multi-model assessments support the idea that the asymmetry results from the combined effects of the asymmetric remote forcing from the equatorial central-eastern Pacific and the asymmetric local sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. It has been proposed that the asymmetric circulation anomalies over the tropical WNP have a contribution to the asymmetric decaying rates between El Niño and La Niña. The mechanism works in the CMIP5 models. Those models that can (cannot) simulate the asymmetry between WNPAC and WNPC tend to reproduce ENSO with asymmetric (symmetric) decaying rates. In the observation, WNPAC maintains throughout El Niño decaying summer. The maintenance of WNPAC primarily relies on the local forcing of underlying cold SST anomalies in the early summer, remaining from preceding winter and spring, whereas to remote forcing from the tropical Indian Ocean in the late summer. The two mechanisms are reproduced by the multi-model ensemble mean. The scatter diagrams for the CMIP5 models demonstrate that the response of WNPAC to the remote forcing from the tropical Indian Ocean intensifies from June to July, concurring with the establishment of the climatological WNP monsoon trough.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been acquiring oblique aerial photographs of the coast before and after major storms since 1995 and has amassed a database of over 140,000 photographs of the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts. USGS coastal scientists use these photographs to document and characterize coastal change caused by storms. The images can also be used to evaluate the accuracy of predictive models of coastal erosion. However, the USGS does not have the personnel to manually analyze all of the photographs taken after a storm. Also, computers cannot yet automatically identify damages and geomorphic changes to the coast from the oblique aerial photographs. There is a high public interest in accessing the limited number of pre- and post-storm photographic pairs the USGS is currently able to share. Recent federal policies that encourage open data and open innovation initiatives have resulted in many federal agencies developing new ways of using citizen science and crowdsourcing techniques to share data and collaborate with the public to accomplish large tasks. The USGS launched a crowdsourcing application in June 2014 called “iCoast – Did the Coast Change?” (\nhttp://coastal.er.usgs.gov/icoast\n) to allow citizens to help USGS scientists identify changes to the coast by comparing USGS aerial photographs taken before and after storms, and then selecting pre-defined tags like “dune scarp” and “sand on road.” The tags are accompanied by text definitions and pictorial examples of these coastal morphology terms and serve to informally and passively educate users about coastal hazards. The iCoast application facilitates greater citizen awareness of coastal change and is an educational resource for teachers and students interested in learning about coastal vulnerability. We expect that the citizen observations from iCoast will assist with probabilistic model development to produce more accurate predictions of coastal vulnerability.",

Plume injection height influences plume transport characteristics, such as directly injected into the free troposphere, resulting the long-range transport. We developed a new method to estimate biomass burning plume injection heights with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) aerosol data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Fire Detection data, and the NASA Langley Trajectory model. We use CALIOP aerosol information to initialize aerosol-filled air parcels in the Trajectory model. Then, the trajectory model is run backwards until there is a coincidence between MODIS fire detections and smoke parcels. In this presentation, we focus on the Tripod fire, one of the largest fires in the lower 48 in recent US history for July-August 2006. We examine biomass burning injection heights of the Tripod fire and evaluate the modeled plume injection height with satellite derived observed plume height.",

            "abstract": "The Vanda Dike Swarm is a set of >600 compositionally diverse dikes that are unusually well exposed in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. New precise zircon age determinations indicate that they intruded between 491 and 495 Ma. The dikes range in composition from basaltic to rhyolitic, although they are arguably bimodal. They were emplaced into both foliated and massive Cambrian granitoids of the Ross Orogeny and their Proterozoic wall rocks. There is no apparent relationship between the major element composition and the dikes’ emplacement age or location. Most dikes have distinctly non-planar contacts, and there is no evidence that dike emplacement was controlled by basement structure, either on a meter scale or regionally. Instead, most dikes are sinuous, strike 28 to 44°, and dip eastward (many <70°), indicating tectonic controls on emplacement. The dikes are not distributed evenly: many are concentrated in km-scale areas, which may mark the infrastructure of central volcanoes. Chilled margins and glassy groundmass indicates that the dike swarm was emplaced at shallow levels. So far as we know, there are no coeval volcanic rocks in the region, where the Devonian to Triassic Beacon Standstone unconformably overlies the dikes and their wallrocks. Many of the dikes have strongly mylonitized margins with normal sense of shear, indicating that solidified dikes served as normal faults. Otherwise, so far as we are aware, there is no recognizable evidence for normal faulting in the area. Our interpretation is that the dikes were emplaced into the shallow crust at the end of the Ross Orogeny, at the culmination of uplift and synchronous with extension. They thus represent the transition from an Andean-type margin to a rifting environment, in all likelihood due to reconfiguration of subduction near the end of the Cambrian.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological testing in a tomographic sequence as shown by the use of hydraulic tomography, allows an improvement of the spatial resolution of subsurface parameters. In this regard, recent studies show increasing interest in tracer tomography which involves sequential and spatially separated tracer injections and the measurement of their corresponding tracer breakthrough at different locations and depths. Such concentration measurements however require large experimental efforts and can be simplified by geophysical tracer monitoring techniques such as electrical resistivity. In this study, we present the use of 4-D, cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) for monitoring salt tracer experiments in high velocity flow fields. For our study, we utilized a set up that enables the conduction of salt tracer experiments with complete recovery within 84 hours over a transport distance of 16 m. This allows the repetition of the experiments with different injection depths for a tomographic salt tracer testing. For ERT monitoring, we designed modular borehole electrodes for repeated usage in a flexible manner. We also assess the use of a high speed resistivity data acquisition mode for field scale tracer monitoring ensuring high spatial and temporal resolution without sacrificing data accuracy. We applied our approach at the Lauswiesen test site, Tübingen, Germany. In our 10 m × 10 m tracer monitoring domain with 16 borehole electrodes, we acquired 4650 data points in less than 18 minutes for each monitoring cycle. Inversion results show that the tracer could be successfully imaged using this approach. The results show that repeated salt tracer tests can be efficiently monitored at a high resolution with ERT which gives the possibility for salt tracer tomography at field scale. Our results also provide a data base for extending current hydrogeophysical inversion approaches to field scale data.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical properties of the lithosphere are increasingly recognized as having a quantifiable influence on the rates and patterns of surface processes. Strain localization, controlled by the mechanical response to local tectonic and topographic stress fields, manifests as tabular fault damage zones that impose displacement, strength, and grain size distribution patterns on the Earth’s surface. Brittle failure and comminution associated with seismogenic cataclasis can reduce bedrock cohesion by several orders of magnitude and generate dense fracture networks, such that the grains released by rock weathering are much finer than those produced by weathering of the surrounding undamaged, intact bedrock. We combine models of landscape evolution and crustal mechanics to investigate how strain-induced crustal failure can exert significant controls on the rates and patterns of landscape development and adjustment. Based on our model results, drainage network patterns tend to reflect the geometry of underlying active or inactive tectonic structures due to the rapid erosion and transport of fault gouge. Fault erosion can be over an order of magnitude faster than erosion of intact bedrock. Fault zones with shallow dip angle are capable of enforcing lateral migration of their structurally confined rivers. Deep valleys created by eroding faults quickly become armored by coarse sediments transported from nearby intact bedrock. Differential displacement affects drainage network patterns by deforming and uplifting the surface relative to baselevel while simultaneously exposing fresh fault damage zones. Topography produced from these processes reflects the strong mechanical anisotropy associated with strain localization and brittle failure over many length scales, contrasting with the absence of a strong directional dependence from dendritic rivers incising into a predominantly homogeneous substrate. Our methods have been used to produce accurate predictions about local and regional stress and strain fields in New Zealand and the Himalayan Eastern Syntaxis.",

They are fault-contacted with Carboniferous turbidites with mostly NE trend and some NS trend with ages mostly Ordovician-Silurian and some Late Devonian. The boundary faults and the foliation inside the mélanges are of high-angle or nearly vertical. The NE trend ophiolitic mélange belts were structurally emplaced into the Carboniferous strata mainly by dextral transpressive deformation, but the NS trend ophiolitic mélange belts mainly by lateral extrusion deformation or pure shearing, suggesting a\nuniform\nstress field of nearly EW compression controlled the emplacements. The tectonic relationship between the ophiolitic mélanges and the Carboniferous turbidites imply that the ophiolitic mélanges are the main components of the basement of the Carboniferous strata. The geophysical data also reveal that high gravity, high magnetic and medium resistivity exist under the Carboniferous strata, matching well to the distribution of the ophiolitic mélanges on the surface. The\nneodymium\nmodel ages (TDM) of widely distributed Late Carboniferous-Permian granites are mostly between 0.352-0.923Ga and concentrate in 0.45-0.6Ga with positive eNd(t) mostly between 5~10, suggesting the Early Paleozoic rocks as the main magma source, consistent with the age of the ophiolitic mélanges, also coinciding with the conclusion of the ophiolitic mélanges as the basement of the Carboniferous strata.\nThe Carboniferous turbidites primarily formed in residual basin. Early Permian terrestrial coarse molasses deposits unconformitily cover on the Carboniferous turbidites, suggesting the residual basin closed in Late Carboniferous. The accretionary complex or residual oceanic crust emplaced into the overlying Carboniferous turbidites through the dextral transpression or lateral extrusion due to EW convergent when the residual basin closed.\nThe tectonic juxtaposition relationship between the ophiolitic mélanges and the younger lateral strata with same stratigraphic system suggests that the ophiolitic mélange belts do not separate different tectonic palaeogeographic or stratigraphic divisions. The traditional understanding of the ophiolitic mélange belt as plate or terrane boundary should be carefully to apply to the West Jungar.",

            "abstract": "Ireland and its continental shelves are located in a structurally complex part of the European North Atlantic Margin. The northern part of the margin (e.g. the Rockall Basin) is considered to be magma-rich, whereas the southern part of the margin (e.g. the Porcupine Basin) is relatively magma-poor. Despite this fundamental difference, the Rockall and Porcupine regions have much in common: both have a dominant structural grain inherited from the Caledonian Orogeny, and were variably deformed by Variscan compression and multiple phases of extension and rifting. Rifting culminated in continental breakup between the North American and European plates in the Paleogene. Following continental breakup, both regions were further deformed by phases of Cenozoic compression, which have been attributed to many different causes, including the Alpine Orogeny.\nHydrocarbon exploration in the region has met with limited success. This is in part due to the complex structure of the margin, and a number of persisting questions regarding the location, age, and nature of potential source and reservoir rocks, and the timing and evolution of structural traps. This study aims to re-evaluate the structural framework that underpins hydrocarbon exploration in the region. The study is based on a compilation of georeferenced maps and cross-sections, a newly merged set of marine gravity and aeromagnetic data, as well as published seismic and public domain data gravity and magnetic data, all of which are integrated in GIS. The integration of seismic and potential field data allows us to use the strengths of these different geophysical methods to investigate the crustal architecture from the seabed to the Moho. Quantitative interpretation of the crust is achieved by 2D gravity and magnetic modelling along key B.I.R.P.S seismic lines in the Rockall and Porcupine basins. These models are used to highlight similarities and differences between these areas and to suggest how the structure of the Irish Margin has developed through the Late Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic.",

Despite its frequent appearance, such type of wave was neither widely observed, nor well understood in the past, primarily due to a paucity of measurements in Polar Regions. At McMurdo, the simultaneous observations of such waves using lidar, radar and airglow imager can provide their unique 3-D intrinsic wave-propagation properties, which are greatly needed for understanding their sources and potential impacts. This study presents the first coincident observation of IGWs by lidar, radar and airglow imager in the Antarctic mesopause region. On 11 June 2013, coherent wave structures with observed period of ~ 5 h and vertical wavelength of ~20 km were observed in both the Fe lidar temperature and MF radar winds. Derived from hodograph analysis, the wave has a horizontal wavelength of ~1200 km and propagates southward at ~60 m/s. The phase relationship between the temperature and winds is in good agreement with the gravity wave polarization relationship. Similar wave structures were also observed in the airglow keograms. The results of the horizontal propagation information obtained from appropriate filtering and applying a non-linear least-square fit of the keograms are similar to those estimated from the combined lidar-radar hodograph analysis. A Monte Carlo sampling method is used to perform all the non-linear fits of the observations to the linear gravity wave models.",

We examine the morphological and sedimentological changes in the Upper Missouri River, between the Garrison Dam in ND (operational in 1953) and Oahe Dam in SD (operational in 1959) (the Garrison Dam segment). Through historical aerial photography, stream gage data, and cross sectional surveys, we demonstrate that the influence of the upstream dam is still a major control of river dynamics when the backwater effects of the downstream reservoir begin. We propose a conceptual model of how interacting dams could affect river morphology, resulting in distinct and recognizable geomorphic sequences that we term “Inter-Dam Sequence”. Based on previous research on the geomorphic adjustment and recovery of sediment loads downstream from large dams, we define a distance criterion for dam interaction. We use this criterion to demonstrate that there are more than 400 reaches on large rivers in the United States that could be geomorphically controlled by dam interactions, similar to the Garrison Dam segment.",

However, unlike MODIS, VIIRS lacks key water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels used by the MODIS cloud algorithms for high cloud detection and cloud-top property retrievals (including emissivity), as well as multilayer cloud detection. In addition, there is a significant change in the spectral location of the 2.1 μm shortwave-infrared channel used by MODIS for cloud microphysical retrievals.\nThe climate science community will face an interruption in the continuity of key global cloud data sets once the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua sensors cease operation. Given the instrument differences between MODIS EOS and VIIRS S-NPP/JPSS, we discuss methods for merging the 14+ year MODIS observational record with VIIRS/CrIS observations in order to generate cloud climate data record continuity across the observing systems.\nThe main approach used by our team was to develop a cloud retrieval algorithm suite that is applied only to the common MODIS and VIIRS spectral channels. The suite uses heritage algorithms that produce the existing MODIS cloud mask (MOD35), MODIS cloud optical and microphysical properties (MOD06), and NOAA AWG/CLAVR-x cloud-top property products. Global monthly results from this hybrid algorithm suite (referred to as MODAWG) will be shown. Collocated CALIPSO comparisons will be shown that can independently evaluate inter-instrument product consistency for a subset of the MODAWG datasets.",

            "abstract": "Iron isotopes show systematic changes in igneous rocks that have been ascribed to fractional crystallization, partial melting, as well as, diffusion effects. Layered mafic intrusions, such as the Paleoproterozoic Bushveld Igneous Complex, are ideally suited to investigate stable isotope fractionation arising principally by fractional crystallization. The upper 2.1km of the Bushveld Complex (Upper and Upper Main Zone, UUMZ) crystallized from a basaltic magma produced by a major recharge event, building up a sequence of tholeiitic, Fe-rich, gabbroic cumulate rocks that display systematic variations in mineralogy and mineral compositions consistent with fractional crystallization. Within this sequence, magnetite joins the liquidus assemblage at ∼260m, followed by olivine at 460m and apatite at 1000m. Here, we present iron isotope measurements of bulk cumulate rocks from the Bierkraal drill core of UUMZ of the western limb. Iron was chemically separated from its matrix and analyzed for δ56Fe (relative to IRMM- 014) with a Nu plasma MC-ICPMS at the University of California, Davis, using (pseudo-) high resolution and sample-standard bracketing. The δ56Fe values for Bushveld cumulates span a range from 0.04‰ to 0.36‰, and systematically correlate with the relative abundance of pyroxene + olivine, magnetite and plagioclase. Notably, the highest δ56Fe values are found in plagioclase-rich cumulates that formed prior to magnetite crystallization. δ56Fe is also high in magnetite-rich cumulates at the onset of magnetite crystallization, while subsequent cumulates exhibit lower and variable δ56Fe principally reflecting fractionation of and modal variations in magnetite, pyroxene and fayalitic olivine. The overall relationships for δ56Fe are consistent with positive mineral – liquid Fe isotope fractionation factors for magnetite and plagioclase, and negative to near zero values for pyroxene and olivine. These initial results are being integrated into a forward model of the Bushveld liquid line of descent and will be compared to complementary work on the Skaergaard intrusion.",

            "abstract": "Carbonates are some of the most abundant rock forming minerals in the crust; carbonate dominated rocks form the bedrock of many populated areas and host seismogenic fault systems as well as energy resource reservoirs and aquifers. In many ways, the mechanical behaviors of silicate rocks and carbonate rocks are analogous; however, the ways in which the behaviors differ can be substantial. In particular, the ease of crystal plastic deformation at upper crustal conditions and the chemical effects of hydrothermal fluids can lead to significant divergence in the mechanical behavior of carbonate rocks compared to more commonly studied silicate rocks. To explore the chemical effects of pore fluids on the deformation of porous carbonate rocks, we ran hydrostatic and axial deformations in traditional triaxial configuration on Indiana Limestone (>98% calcite, ~16% porosity) at effective confining pressures from 10 to 50 MPa, temperatures from 23 to 75°C, and saturated with equilibrium and disequilibrium pore fluids. In-situ permeability measurements were made during tests. Over these pressure and temperature conditions, the inelastic behavior and failure modes of limestone samples change from localized shear failure to shear-enhanced compaction to cataclastic dilation. We find that elevated temperature and pore fluid saturation both have a weakening effect on the limestone, reducing yield strength and favoring yield by shear-enhanced compaction. Permeability is negatively correlated with axial deformation at all conditions. In addition, we find that the chemistry of the pore fluid has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of the limestone, with disequilibrium pore fluid causing more pronounced weakening than equilibrium pore fluids. Microstructural observation of deformed samples shows that failure behaviors are controlled by the competition between microcracking and crystal plasticity.",

            "abstract": "One of the more surprising findings of the MESSENGER spacecraft is the confirmation that the smallest terrestrial planet has an internally generated, dipolar magnetic field, which is likely driven by a combination of thermal and compositional buoyancy sources. This observation places constraints on the thermal and energetic state of Mercury’s large iron core and on mantle dynamics because dynamo operation is strongly dependent on the amount of heat extracted from the core by the mantle. However, other observations point to several factors that should inhibit a present-day dynamo. These include physical constraints on a thin, possibly non-convecting mantle, as well as properties of liquid iron alloys that promote compositional stratification in the core.\nWe consider a range of self-consistent internal structures, core compositions and thermal evolution models that are also consistent with observational constraints, and assess the circumstances under which a dynamo is permitted to operate in Mercury’s core. We present the thermal evolution models, 1D parameterized convection models and planetary entropy calculations. We attempt to account for the large uncertainties on some parameters by considering various end member cases.\nWe examine the thermal and magnetic implications of a long-lived lateral temperature difference resulting from Mercury’s orbital resonance and how it may play a role in driving the planetary dynamo. We compare simulations of mantle heat flow using the ASPECT convection code to predictions from the parameterized models and produce heat flow maps at the CMB. To represent fluid dynamics and magnetic field generation inside Mercury’s core, a numerical dynamo model is performed by using the obtained heat flux maps.\nLastly, we also investigate the seismic observability of the different structural models of Mercury to determine the extent to which any future single-seismometer mission will be able to provide alternative insights into Mercury's internal dynamics.\nThis study was initiated at the 2014 CIDER summer program on the dynamics of planetary interiors.",

            "abstract": "The crystalline complex and overlying sedimentary sequences in southern and central Sinai are highly dissected by numerous faults, shear systems, and dikes, hereafter referred to as discontinuities. Understanding the distribution of these discontinuities, their cross cutting relations, and the hydraulic gradient gives clues as to the distribution of water resources in the area. In the study area, extensional tectonics has been active as early as the Precambrian era as evidenced by the widely distributed dikes, bimodal volcanics, and dip-slip faults and shear zones of varying ages. These extensional tectonics and associated structural elements enhance the porosity and permeability of Sinai’s basement and overlying sedimentary sequences. To investigate the impact of the discontinuities on groundwater flow, the following steps were conducted: 1) the spatial and temporal precipitation events over the basement complex were identified from TRMM data; 2) observations extracted from temporal change in backscattering coefficient in radar (Envisat ASAR radar scenes) were used to identify water-bearing discontinuities; 3) the discontinuities were delineated using false color images that were generated from ASTER, SIR C and band ratio images, 4) field observations, Very Low Frequency (VLF), magnetic investigations, and stable isotopic analyses for groundwater samples were then applied to refine satellite-based observations and selections, test the validity of our satellite-based methodologies for locating sub-vertical discontinuities, and decipher their role as conduits or barriers for groundwater flow. Findings include: (1) sub-vertical faults and shear zones and highly weathered chilled margins of sub-vertical mafic dykes are water-bearing and are conducive for groundwater flow; felsic dykes are massive (do not promote groundwater flow), (2) groundwater flow generally follows the topographic relief, but locally the flow is controlled by the discontinuities, (3) discontinuities that are sub-parallel to groundwater flow direction act as preferred pathways for groundwater flow, whereas those that intersect groundwater flow directions at high angles act as barriers, raise groundwater level in the upstream, and locally they redirect groundwater flow to align with their trends.",

            "abstract": "Background seismicity has been relatively low at Mount St. Helens (MSH) following its last eruption in 2004-2008, with an average of 95 located M > 0 events per year. This is in marked contrast to the five years immediately following the 1980-86 eruptive period, when the yearly average rate was about 400 events. During that time there was clear evidence, in the form of rotated fault-plane solutions (FPS), that magma recharge was occurring at depths > 2 km. Despite lower seismicity rates and generally smaller earthquakes, an improved seismic network recorded data sufficient to allow for computation of 88 FPS for the period 2008-2013. These FPS show that stress fields at depths > 2 km were rotated in a manner similar to that seen post-1980-86, providing evidence that magma recharge is again occurring at MSH. A subtle trend towards slightly deeper earthquakes since 2011 is consistent with this hypothesis, as is previously reported outward motion on GPS stations that has been modeled with an inflationary source beneath the volcano at ~8-9 km depth.\nIn the summer of 2014, 70 broadband seismometers were installed within 50 km of MSH as part of the iMUSH experiment, greatly increasing the number of stations close enough to MSH to obtain good recordings of MSH-generated events. By the Fall AGU meeting we expect to have several months of data collected and processed from iMUSH stations. These data should greatly improve constraints on first-motion FPS and/or the number of events for which well-constrained FPS can be computed. In addition, the density of three-component stations may allow for computation of moment tensor solutions for larger events (M > 1), which typically occur ~20 times per year. This would allow us to assess whether recent MSH events have significant non-double-couple components, something that could indicate fluid involvement and that has previously only been seen during eruptive periods at MSH via short-term deployments of broadband stations.",

After the termination of the SSE in 2005, no obvious long-term SSE was detected and that makes difficult to discuss a recurrence interval of the events. In order to reveal whether the event repeats or not, and if it repeats, to clarify the interval and a temporal and spatial change of the coupling and the LSSE, I analyzed a leveling data from 1981 to 1999 -- before the era of GNSS -- and deduced spatial patterns of the vertical crustal deformation rate.\nThe deduced rates show two sorts of spatial patterns and the patterns appear alternately. One of them resembles the pattern during the LSSE between 2000 and 2005. Summing up the results and accounting for the estimation errors, it is clear that there are at least three events in the last thirty years; 2000-2005 (already and well known event), 1987-1990, and around 1983. The 2000-2005 event is the biggest and longest one, while 1983 event is the smallest and shortest one in the three events. It suggests that the duration of the event is longer, the interval to the next event becomes longer, and that there are some relationships between the size, duration time, and the recurrence interval of the events. These features are very unique for the Tokai LSSEs compared with those in the other regions such as the Bungo Channel and Cascadia.",

This area is characterized by stable near-surface salinity stratification that is produced by the mixed layer dilution by local rainfall. Here the fresh and warm mixed layer is periodically disrupted by the gap wind-induced uplifts of colder and saltier water. Aquarius SSS data capture these high SSS events. In boreal winter when the intense gap winds are frequent, two tongues of anomalously salty water develop off the Gulfs of Tehuantepec and Papagayo. During that season the average SSS in the meridionally oriented Tehuantepec tongue is about 0.4 psu saltier than background SSS. The zonally elongated Papagayo tongue stands out even more strongly, being 1 to 2 psu saltier than SSS in the neighboring Panama Bight. The spatial locations and orientations of these salty tongues closely correspond to the locations and orientations of the cool SST tongues suggesting they have similar governing mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Two decades of hydroacoustic monitoring combined with in situ OBS and OBH experiments have identified nine seismically well-defined seafloor events at mid-ocean ridges with characteristics consistent with eruptive activity. The majority of these events occurred at fast and intermediate spreading ridges, where eruption recurrence rates are expected to be higher. Most have also been verified as eruptions through direct seafloor observations. This suite of crustal accretion events, when examined together, suggest patterns of activity that are influenced by both short and long term tidal forces. Tidal triggering of earthquakes in the mid-ocean ridge environment is well established, but until recently data has been lacking on the timing of seafloor eruptions with which to make statistically robust inferences. OBS and OBH earthquake data on the East Pacific Rise and Axial volcano both indicate a steady increase in the rate of seismic activity preceding an eruption, consistent with an increasing state of stress of the system. All of these observations are consistent with a model of crustal accretion that is sensitive to small perturbations in loading both in the short and longer term. Implications of this sensitivity will be presented along with observations to support it.",

At present, site managers have limited tools to gain detailed information on the distribution of possible underground barriers or anomalous bodies. The technology employed in Taiwan to evaluate or confirm subsurface anomalies relies primarily on surface geophysical surveys, borehole drillings, or past records. Surface ground-penetrating radar \u0001GPR\u0002 survey is among the most popular of these methods. Surface GPR technique can be used in many ways, but this method is not always the best suited to Taiwan’s conditions. Surface GPR surveys are adversely affected by the conductivity of silty/clayey sediment and cultural noises. As a result, when surface GPR surveys are used, both detection and resolution of subsurface anomalies will decrease with depth. In order to overcome these obstacles, the use of borehole GPR \u0001BGPR\u0002 with a few boreholes may provide a more direct and effective way to detect an underground target. Recent improvement in the quality of BGPR contributes to the suitability of this type of survey work when implemented on construction sites. This paper ues the BGPR geophysical technology has been developed to overcome above limitations. The information of multi-wells logging could be used to interpret the permeability of subsurface, the dominate flow path and the hot-spot for evaluating the distribution of pollution and the efficiency of remediation in different time sequences.",

            "abstract": "The largest emissions sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas and the primary component of natural gas, are the fossil fuel sector and microbial processes that occur in agricultural settings, landfills, and wetlands. Attribution of methane to these different source sectors has proven difficult, as evidenced by persistent disagreement between the annual emissions estimated from atmospheric observations (top-down) and from inventories (bottom-up). Given the rapidly changing natural gas infrastructure in North America, and the implications of associated rapid changes in emissions of methane for climate, it is crucial we improve our ability to quantify and understand current and future methane emissions. Here, we present evidence that continuous in-situ airborne observations of ethane, which is a tracer for fossil fuel emissions, are a new and useful tool for attribution of methane emissions to specific source sectors. Additionally, with these new airborne observations we present the first tightly constrained ethane emissions estimates of oil and gas production fields using the well-known mass balance method.\nThe ratios of ethane-to-methane (C2H6:CH4) of specific methane emissions sources were studied over regions of high oil and gas production from the Barnett, TX and Bakken, ND shale plays, using continuous (1Hz frequency) airborne ethane measurements paired with simultaneous methane measurements. Despite the complex mixture of sources in the Barnett region, the methane emissions were well-characterized by distinct C2H6:CH4 relationships indicative of a high-ethane fossil fuel source (e.g., “wet” gas), a low-ethane fossil fuel source (e.g., “dry” gas), and an ethane-free, or microbial source. The defined set of C2H6:CH4 that characterized the emissions input to the atmosphere was used in conjunction with the total ethane and methane fluxes to place bounds on the fraction of methane emissions attributable to each source. Additionally, substantial ethane fluxes from the Barnett and Bakken regions were observed (1% to 10% of estimated national ethane emissions), and emissions of these magnitudes may significantly impact regional atmospheric chemistry and air quality by influencing production of tropospheric ozone.",

            "abstract": "Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) from the prairie pothole region of North America are particularly vulnerable to loss and increasing urban, agricultural, and natural resource development pressures continue to place these wetlands at risk. Although small in area and low in surface hydrologic connectivity, GIWs provide important functions such as flood control and water purification and their loss has been recognized as a contributing factor to the eutrophication of Lake Winnipeg. Within Canada, GIW loss can be attributed to the lack of high-resolution wetland inventories and the lack of information about historic wetland loss rates. In this study, we tested an approach to estimate GIW loss by improving their detection and delineation. To initialize our work, a high-resolution wetland inventory was created using a novel approach that fuses LiDAR data (probability of wetland) with aerial photographs (to distinguish open water and wet meadow) for the Beaverhill watershed, a major tributary of the North Saskatchewan watershed. Our wetland mapping results validated our ability to detect wetlands on the landscape. Secondly, we applied a power law area-frequency function to an aerial photograph time series spanning the watershed’s natural climate variation range (1960 to present) to estimate historic wetland loss, with historic wetland loss determined via a break in slope in the power law function. Our analysis revealed ongoing loss of small GIWs in the watershed, despite the implementation of wetland policy measures to mitigate this loss. This ongoing GIW loss is particularly detrimental as it is concomitant with a loss in the important associated ecosystem functions of these GIWs, which has serious repercussions for downstream waters. Overall, our findings support a shift in wetland policies from area to function assessments that provide governments with tools to manage the potential consequences of wetland loss in terms of increased flooding and pollution of downstream waters.",

            "abstract": "With four centuries of solar evolution, the International Sunspot Number (SSN) forms the longest solar time series currently available. It provides an essential reference for understanding and quantifying how the solar output has varied over decades and centuries and thus for assessing the variations of the main natural forcing on the Earth climate.\nBecause of its importance, this unique time-series must be closely monitored for any possible biases and drifts. Here, we report about recent disagreements between solar indices, for example the sunspot sumber and the 10.7cm radio flux. Recent analyses indicate that while part of this divergence may be due to a calibration drift in the SSN, it also results from an intrinsic change in the global magnetic parameters of sunspots and solar active regions, suggesting a possible transition to a new activity regime.\nGoing beyond the SSN series, in the framework of the TOSCA (www.cost-tosca.eu/) and SOLID (projects.pmodwrc.ch/solid/) projects, we produced a survey of all existing catalogs providing detailed sunspot information (Lefevre & Clette, 2014:10.1007/s11207-012-0184-5) and we also located different primary solar images and drawing collections that can be exploitable to complement the existing catalogs. These are first steps towards the construction of a multi-parametric time series of multiple sunspot and sunspot group properties over more than a century, allowing to reconstruct and extend the current 1-D SSN series. By bringing new spatial, morphological and evolutionary information, such a data set should bring major advances for the modeling of the solar dynamo and solar irradiance. We will present here the current status of this work. The preliminary version catalog now extends over the last 150 years. It makes use of data from DPD (http://fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/DPD/index.html), from the Uccle Solar Equatorial Table (USET:http://sidc.oma.be/uset/) operated by the Royal Obeservatory of Belgium, the Greenwich Catalog (RGO:http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/) as well as the Kodaikanal white light data.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 318 drilled an inshore to offshore transect of sites across the Antarctic Wilkes Land margin to provide a long-term record of Cenozoic Antarctic glaciation and its relationships with global climatic and oceanographic changes. The expedition recovered ~2000 m of high-quality middle Eocene–Holocene sediments from water depths between 400 and 4000 m at seven sites on the Wilkes Land rise and shelf. Sediment cores provide an insight into ~54 million years of Antarctic history starting with an ice-free subtropical east Antarctica during the late Eocene, and the first cooling during the middle Eocene, coeval with the first incursion of cold westward flowing waters across the southern Tasman Gateway. The cores also reveal the erosional consequences of the onset of the continent-wide glaciation during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, and its effect in rising sea level around the Antarctic coastlines. Starting in the earliest Oligocene (Oi-1 event), the icehouse sediments provide records of the subsequent waxing and waning of the ice sheets, sea ice, and ecosystems. These include times of past elevated temperatures and CO2 concentrations (i.e., the early Pliocene) and unprecedented seasonal to annual resolution records of the last deglaciation that began ~10,000 y ago. Wilkes Land records should be complimentary to those from Prydz Bay (ODP Legs 119 and 188) and the Ross Sea (ANDRILL, CRP), allowing for variations between different east Antarctic ice sheet sectors to be assessed, which will provide a better understanding of East Antarctica’s role in the past, present, and future global climate system.",

            "abstract": "The potential for accelerated sea-level rise under anthropogenic warming is a significant societal problem, in particular in world’s coastal deltaic regions where about half of the world’s population resides. Quantifying geophysical sources of sea-level rise with the goal of improved projection at local scales remains a complex and challenging interdisciplinary research problem. These processes include ice-sheet/glacier ablations, steric sea-level, solid Earth uplift or subsidence due to GIA, tectonics, sediment loading or anthropogenic causes, hydrologic imbalance, and human processes including water retention in reservoirs and aquifer extraction. The 2013 IPCC AR5 concluded that the observed and explained geophysical causes of global geocentric sea-level rise, 1993–2010, is closer towards closure. However, the discrepancy reveals that circa 1.3→37.5% of the observed sea-level rise remains unexplained. This relatively large discrepancy is primarily attributable to the wide range of estimates of respective contributions of Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets and mountain/peripheral glaciers to sea-level rise. Understanding and quantifying the natural and anthropogenic processes governing solid Earth (land, islands and sea-floor) uplift or subsidence at the regional and local scales remain elusive to enable addressing coastal vulnerability due to relative sea-level rise hazards, such as the Bangladesh Delta. This study focuses on addressing coastal vulnerability of Bangladesh, a Belmont Forum/IGFA project, BanD-AID (\nhttp://Belmont-SeaLevel.org\n). Sea-level rise, along with tectonic, sediment load and groundwater extraction induced land uplift/subsidence, have exacerbated Bangladesh’s coastal vulnerability, affecting 150 million people in one of the world’s most densely populated regions. Here we present preliminary results using space geodetic observations, including satellite radar and laser altimetry, GRACE gravity, tide gauge, hydrographic, and GPS/InSAR observed land subsidence, and via fingerprint sea-level adjustment and reconstructed sea-level approaches, for improved quantification of major contributions to, and the projection of relative sea-level rise at the Bangladesh delta, towards addressing its coastal vulnerability and sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Marine particles can act as both a source and sink for dissolved iron and thus play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of this important micronutrient in the ocean. However, not all particulate iron (pFe) is considered to be biologically available, with some fraction locked away in mineral matrices. As a result, analyses that estimate the bioavailable fraction of pFe are a valuable addition to studies of iron distribution. One such analysis involves the use of an oxalate-EDTA leach at pH 8, with heating, to estimate “ligand-leachable” iron. We will present concentration profiles of ligand-leachable iron associated with suspended (0.8 – 51 μm) particles from the GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect: a dataset that includes labile particulate iron concentrations measured in the mixed layer, chlorophyll maximum, benthic nepheloid layers, oxygen minimum zones and hydrothermal plume. Where relevant, we compare concentrations to measurements made in similar areas during the US GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal transect. In addition, we will present initial results from US GEOTRACES EPZT of the stable isotopic composition of iron (δ56Fe) in the ligand leachable fraction and discuss the results in terms of biogeochemical cycling of particulate iron.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is responsible for about 17% of the total direct radiative forcing from long-lived greenhouse gases (IPCC 2013). While the global emission of methane is relatively well quantified, the temporal and spatial variability of methane emissions from individual area or point sources are still poorly understood. Using 4 field methods (aircraft-based mass balance, tracer correlation, vertical radial plume mapping, and static chambers) and a new field-validated process-based model (California Landfill Methane Inventory Model, CALMIM 5.4), we investigated both the total emissions from a central Indiana landfill as well as the partitioned emissions inclusive of methanotrophic oxidation for the various cover soils. This landfill is an upwind source for the city of Indianapolis, so the resolution of m2 to km2 scale emissions, as well as understanding the temporal variability for this complex area source, contributes to improved regional inventory calculations. Emissions for the site as a whole were measured using both an aircraft-based mass balance approach as well as a ground-based tracer correlation method, permitting direct comparison of the strengths, limitations, and uncertainties of these two approaches. Because US landfills are highly-engineered and composed of daily, intermediate, and final cover areas with differing thicknesses, composition, and implementation of gas recovery, we also expected different emission signatures and strengths from the various cover areas. Thus we also deployed static chambers and vertical radial plume mapping to quantify the spatial variability of emissions from the thinner daily and intermediate cover areas. Understanding the daily, seasonal and annual emission rates from a landfill is not trivial, and usually requires a combination of measurement and modeling approaches. Thus, our unique data set provides an opportunity to gain an improved understanding of the emissions from a complex area source, an essential requirement for developing improved urban-scale greenhouse gas inventories relevant for addressing mitigation strategies. We report on the results here.",

            "abstract": "Large uncertainty in the direct radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) exists, with published estimates ranging from 0.25 to 0.9 W m−2. A significant source of this uncertainty relates to the vertical distribution of BC, particularly relative to cloud layers. We first compare the vertical distribution of BC in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models to aircraft measurements and find that models tend to overestimate upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric (UT/LS) BC, particularly over the central Pacific from Hiaper Pole-to-Pole Observations Flight 1 (HIPPO1). However, CMIP5 generally underestimates Arctic BC from the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites campaign, implying a geographically dependent bias. Factors controlling the vertical distribution of BC in CMIP5 models, such as wet and dry deposition, precipitation, and convective mass flux (MC), are subsequently investigated. We also perform a series of sensitivity experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5, including prescribed meteorology, enhanced vertical resolution, and altered convective wet scavenging efficiency and deep convection. We find that convective mass flux has opposing effects on the amount of black carbon in the atmosphere. More MC is associated with more convective precipitation, enhanced wet removal, and less BC below 500 hPa. However, more MC, particularly above 500 hPa, yield more BC aloft due to enhanced convective lofting. These relationships—particularly MC versus BC below 500 hPa—are generally stronger in the tropics. Compared to the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, most CMIP5 models overestimate MC, with all models overestimating MC above 500 hPa. Our results suggest that excessive convective transport is one of the reasons for CMIP5 overestimation of UT/LS BC.",

Mis-alignment of the solar rotational and magnetic axes\nleads to the characteristic ballerina-skirt shape of the HCS and during the solar cycle there can be large excursions in the sheet's latitudinal extent. Voyager 2's observations of energetic electron\ndropouts are related to its crossing of this boundary. Magnetic reconnection is also thought to occur as the HCS compresses and narrows between the termination shock and the heliopause. Near the\nequator the two HCS field alignments are present in roughly equal amounts, while near the edges the distribution can be considerably skewed. This will lead to substantial differences in the environments\nof the two Voyager spacecraft since Voyager 1 is north of the equator, but firmly in the sector region, while Voyager 2 is south of the equator and skirting the edges of the sector region. We present\nparticle-in-cell simulations demonstrating the consequences of the reconnection of asymmetric amounts of flux. In particular, we will discuss Voyager 2's remaining time in the heliosphere -- including the\nimplications for the solar wind velocity, energetic particle transport, and the expected structure of Voyager 2's heliopause crossing -- and compare it with the data collected from Voyager 1.",

            "abstract": "In an effort to address gaps in scientific achievement identified in international testing, eleven states have now adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Climate change is currently not incorporated systematically across K-12 classrooms, but is prominent in middle and high school NGSS. The Maryland Delaware Climate Change Education, Assessment, and Research project (MADE CLEAR, a member of the NSF Climate Change Education Program Alliance) is working with Maryland and Delaware State Departments of Education to ease this transition. MADE CLEAR is identifying appropriate materials and providing professional development and classroom support as NGSS-aligned climate curricula are piloted, refined, and adopted by middle school science teachers across both states. Year-long professional development for middle school science teachers begins with a week-long Climate Science Academy that includes climate science content, hands-on experience with vetted classroom activities, familiarization with technology and online resources, and development of curriculum adaptation plans. We will highlight the characteristics deemed most critical for classroom teacher support as identified by the teachers from the first two cohorts, review classroom implementation challenges, and describe planned 2014-2015 school-year sessions. Data from the 2014 (second) cohort of teachers will include pre- and post-assessment data from the Climate Science Academy and impacts of the project on the first cohort (2013) of teachers. Scale-up plans for both states will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Caloris basin on Mercury, measuring approximately 1,550km in diameter, is the largest recognized impact basin on Mercury and among the largest in our solar system. It is host to the Caloris Planitia, the interior smooth plains of the basin, which feature several distinct types of tectonic structures. Contractional wrinkle ridges are generally present throughout the basin, while two distinct sets of extensionally produced graben are found mainly in separate regions; the complex of radial linear graben known as Pantheon Fossae is located in the central region of the basin, while a set of more randomly oriented and concentric graben are found approximately midway between the basin’s centre and its circumference. Although the zones where these two extensional sets occur are mainly distinct, there are some instances of spatial overlap. This work focuses on constraining the relative timing of these diverse structural features, thus helping to unravel the deformational history of the basin by analyzing the geometries and kinematics of the graben and ridges in areas where the structures cross-cut each other. We also seek to quantify and constrain the local strains and stresses associated with these structures. This analysis will further guide future kinematic and mechanical models of Caloris, with end member descriptions ranging from a single mechanism to account for the simultaneous deformation of structures, for interactions which show no consistent order of deformation throughout the basin, to one or more deformational mechanisms driving a multi-stage or sequential deformation, for interactions that demonstrate a clear order of cross-cutting relations.",

            "abstract": "The atolls of the Pacific Ocean are low-lying landforms (less than 5m in elevation), typically consisting of reef-building corals often mounted by subaerial islets, or motu, which encircle a central lagoon. These motu, perched atop old coral reefs, typically consist of sand and gravel, and are sometimes anchored by relict geologic features (highstand coral reefs). Despite the vital role these islets play as home to terrestrial ecosystems and human infrastructure, the morphologic processes responsible for their formation and maintenance remain poorly understood. For example, although extreme events are hypothesized as a formation mechanism, motu are found in regions where hurricanes or tropical cyclones rarely occur and across varying storm gradients and frequency tracks. Here we use hydrodynamic and event-based morphodynamic modeling to better understand the role of storm events on the formation and evolution of motu.\nUsing XBeach, a two-dimensional model of infragravity wave propagation and sediment transport, coupled with the coastal wave model, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), we simulate the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic impacts of storm events on the nearshore, beach, and backbarrier portions of atolls. We investigate the effect of different representative profile morphology, for example motu height or the distance from the reef edge to the motu, on storm response. We further test the effect of storm intensity and inundation scenarios (i.e. difference in elevated water levels of the lagoon and ocean) on storm hydrodynamics and morphologic change. Model scenarios are informed and compared to basin-wide analysis of the variation of atoll and motu characteristics, such as reef width, motu width, and motu spacing across the Pacific Ocean. Atoll morphologies and storm responses are affected by both geographic location and, locally, the shoreline orientation (compared to storm tracks). Combining these different model scenarios with measured morphometrics allows us to develop a better understanding of the response of atolls and motu to climatic forcings, such as varying wave climate, storm frequency and intensity, and increased sea levels.",

            "abstract": "The Bação, Bonfim and Belo Horizonte domes are the largest domes in the Archaean Southern São Francisco craton (Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brazil). These domes are mainly formed by fine-grained banded gneisses typically intruded by leucogranitic veins and by weakly foliated granites, cropping out as large batholiths and small scale-domains closely associated to the gneisses. Granites and gneisses have high silica content (70-76 wt%), K2O ranging from 2wt% to 6wt%, Sr from 600 to 40 ppm and La/Yb from 150 to 5. Based on their K2O/Na2O ratios, these rocks are subdivided in three groups: sodic (K2O/Na2O≤0.7), transitional (0.7<K2O/Na2O<1.1) and potassic (K2O/Na2O≥1.1). There is no direct relationship between the metamorphic overprint (granites vs. gneisses) and the K2O/Na2O ratio; e.g. granites plots equally in the sodic and potassic groups. Overall, the composition of gneisses and granitoids in the three domes marks the transition between Archean TTGs and modern calc-alkalic granitoids. LA-ICP-MS zircon U–Pb data allow three main periods of magmatism to be defined. The oldest recorded magmatic contribution to the craton began at 3200 Ma, as attested by the occurrence of inherited zircons in younger granitoids as well as by the fact that zircons with a ca. 3200 Ma age represent a significant subset in the detrital zircon population of the greenstone belt. Subsequent magmatic events took place at 2930-2870 Ma and 2780-2700 Ma. The geochronological data reveal that, although the sodic rocks represent a greater proportion of the older gneisses, sodic, transitional and potassic granitoids intruded contemporaneously. The geochemistry of sodic and transitional granites and gneisses suggests that they formed by partial melting of TTG source rocks that are not preserved in the rock record. MC-ICP-MS Hf isotope data on magmatic zircon, suggesting crustal reworking with minor or no involvement of juvenile magmas, support this interpretation. Further recycling of sodic-transitional gneisses does not account for the genesis of potassic granitoids whose origin requires the participation of magmas derived by metasedimentary source rocks.",

            "abstract": "Lake Victoria (LV) is an important freshwater resource in East Africa, covering 68,800 km2, and a catchment that spans 193,000km2. It is an important source of food, energy, drinking and irrigation water, transport and a repository for agricultural, human and industrial wastes generated from its catchment. For such a lake, and a catchment transcending 5 international boundaries, collecting data to guide informed decision making is a hard task. Remote sensing is currently the only tool capable of providing information on environmental changes at high spatio-temporal scales. To address the problem of information availability for LV, we tackled two objectives; (1) we analyzed water quality parameters retrieved from MODIS data, and (2) assessed land cover changes in the catchment area using Landsat data. We used L1A MODIS-Aqua data to retrieve lake surface temperature (LST), total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (CHLa) and diffuse attenuation coefficient (KD490) in four temporal periods i.e. daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal scales. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was done on monthly data. An analysis of land cover change was done using Landsat data for 3 epochs in order to assess if land degradation contributes to water quality changes. Our results indicate that MODIS-Aqua data provides synoptic views of water quality changes in LV at different temporal scales. The Winam Gulf in Kenya, the shores of Jinja town in Uganda, as well as the Mwanza region in Tanzania represent water quality hotspots due to their relatively high TSM and CHLa concentrations. High levels of KD490 in these areas would also indicate high turbidity and thus low light penetration due to the presence of suspended matter, algal blooms, and/or submerged vegetation. The EOF analysis underscores the areas where LST and water color variability are more significant. The changes can be associated with corresponding land use changes in the catchment, where for instance wetlands are converted to croplands. On-going dissemination of our findings together with capacity building efforts with the three main fishery and research institutions working in the lake, will enable informed decision making for the water management of LV. Enhanced capacity in trans-boundary water resources research is critical for successful decision making.",

            "abstract": "With the proliferation of broadband recordings from volcanoes, it has become clear that conduit processes produce seismic signals with an extensive range of frequencies. Near the low corner of broadband instruments, the affects of ground rotation can be significant; rotation dominates at periods below the corner. Unraveling the relative influence of translation and rotation on recordings of very-long-period (12 - 120 s) and ultra-long-period (120-600 s) events is an important challenge, because including tilt in inversion of VLP and ULP signals associated with small eruptions can provide constraints on the dynamics of conduit processes. At Fuego volcano in Guatemala, we recorded hundreds of small-scale explosions in field campaigns since 2008 using temporary arrays of seismometers, tiltmeters and microbarometers. Explosions are frequently preceded by 5 to 20 minutes of tilt, indicative of pressurization of the upper conduit. The onset of explosive eruptions, which last from many tens of seconds to more than two minutes, include VLPs with peak periods from less than 30 to nearly 50 seconds. The events are dominated by ash emission that suggests a vulcanian-style downward migration of the magma fragmentation front. Joint inversions of the seismic and tilt signals using synthetic tilt and displacement Green functions provides a more complete view of the eruption process at Fuego. Inversions without tilt point to a source centroid 200 m west of and 300 m below the vent. When lower frequencies are included in the inversion, the source centroid shallows and moves east to a position directly below the vent. We interpret this to reflect a process where the vent seals and pressurizes, producing the ULP signal. The VLP signal results from a rapid change in the deformation of the upper few hundred meters of the conduit due to the ejection of magma during the explosion.",

            "abstract": "Resource assessments for low-grade geothermal applications employ available well temperature measurements to determine if the resource potential is sufficient for supporting district heating opportunities. This study used a compilation of bottomhole temperature (BHT) data from recent unconventional shale oil and gas wells, along with legacy oil, gas, and storage wells, in Pennsylvania (PA) and New York (NY). Our study’s goal was to predict the geothermal resource potential and associated uncertainty for the NY-PA region using kriging interpolation. The dataset was scanned for outliers, and some observations were removed. Because these wells were drilled for reasons other than geothermal resource assessment, their spatial density varied widely. An exploratory spatial statistical analysis revealed differences in the spatial structure of the geothermal gradient data (the kriging semi-variogram and its nugget variance, shape, sill, and the degree of anisotropy). As a result, a stratified kriging procedure was adopted to better capture the statistical structure of the data, to generate an interpolated surface, and to quantify the uncertainty of the computed surface. The area was stratified reflecting different physiographic provinces in NY and PA that have geologic properties likely related to variations in the value of the geothermal gradient. The kriging prediction and the variance-of-prediction were determined for each province by the generation of a semi-variogram using only the wells that were located within that province. A leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was conducted as a diagnostic tool. The results of stratified kriging were compared to kriging using the whole region to determine the impact of stratification. The two approaches provided similar predictions of the geothermal gradient. However, the variance-of-prediction was different. The stratified approach is recommended because it gave a more appropriate site-specific characterization of uncertainty based upon a more realistic description of the statistical structure of the data given the geologic characteristics of each province.",

We report the results extensively on the WURM website (\nhttp://wurm.info\n, Caracas and Bobcioiu, 2011). We find that hydration has a more pronounced effect on the spectroscopic properties than cation replacement. The Raman spectra of all phases present clear SO4 features that are easily identifiable. We use this to show one can use the vibrational spectroscopic information as an identification tool in a remote environment, like the Martian surface.\nBased on the computed vibrational results we analyze the S isotope partitioning. We observe that in general hydration favors enrichment in the lighter S isotope 32S with respect to the heavier 34S, which is accumulated in the less hydrous structures. Thus we show for the first time that the signature of 34S/32S partitioning could be observed by in situ spectroscopy on the surface of Mars.\nFinally we compute hydration energies. For example, in the hydrated magnesium sulfate series we find that epsomite and meridianiite with, respectively 7 and 11 water molecules per MgSO4 unit are particularly stable with respect to other individual or combinations of hydration states (Bobocioiu and Caracas, 2014). This can be related to the diurnal cycle of hydration and dehydration and hence it can improve the modeling of the water circulation on Mars.\n",

            "abstract": "Whereas meander wavelengths of alluvial rivers characteristically scale with bankfull discharge, bedrock meander wavelengths are typically 5–10 times greater than the scaling relationship for alluvial rivers would suggest, a fact that has led some to conclude that bedrock meanders are “underfit.” Others, however, have reasoned that larger dominant discharges should be expected for bedrock meanders to erode bank toes and mobilize sediment in bank-shielding scree piles, which often accompany steep, even vertical, outside banks capable of supplying coarse debris via landslide, debris flow, and rockfall. We attempt to test this hypothesis by finding dominant discharges for the Buffalo National River, Arkansas, by several methods. First, assuming that, as with alluvial meanders, bedrock meander wavelengths are 7–15 times hydraulic width at dominant discharge, we use cross-sections extracted from LiDAR-derived DEMs to find discharges corresponding to objectively-determined meander wavelengths. Second, assuming that dominant discharge must mobilize scree mantling outer-bank toe slopes, we use measured grain size distributions and cross sections to determine this discharge. For each of these calculated discharges, we use flow-duration curves to find corresponding recurrence intervals. Third, assuming that mean residence times of scree are similar to dominant discharge recurrence intervals, we use measured scree volumes and flux rates inferred from lateral migration rates to find those residence times. Preliminary results for the site with the longest gauge record yield a mean recurrence interval of 26 yrs corresponding to a meander wavelength-to-width scaling ratio of 11 (9–139 yrs for scaling ratios of 7–15). Recurrence intervals found by the other methods await field and cosmogenic isotope concentration measurements.",

            "abstract": "Detailed documentation of the exhumation history of southeastern Tibet is important for understanding of the coupling of tectonic and geomorphic processes shaping this landscape. We present K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar multi-diffusion domain model analysis and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology along both horizontal and vertical traverses within Gangdese batholith to constrain the spatial and temporal pattern of exhumation in the region. In conjunction with thermokinematic modeling we use these data to interrogate patterns of regional erosion and test mechanical models of plateau evolution such as delamination, lithospheric-scale folding, and rifting. Previously reported zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from a vertical transect west of the Nari Yun Chu Rift indicate a prolonged period of exhumation between ~20 Ma and 12 Ma. To the east, K-feldspar modeling of a sample on the Nyang River shows a period of rapid cooling between ~18-15 Ma that is consistent with an extended period of rapid exhumation. However, zircon (U-Th)/He data vary by ~30 Ma across an E-W transect through the region, which indicates that either the period of rapid erosion occurred much earlier in the west than in the east, or erosion was faster in the east, and removed significantly more material. These differences in exhumation between the E and W correlate with a documented increase in the depth of the Moho and general decrease in relief from E to W. These spatial correlations suggest linkages between deep geodynamic processes and the development of mountain topography. Variability in km-scale exhumation despite common mountain summit elevations throughout southeastern Tibet indicates that this region underwent a complex and protracted unroofing history. Additional data and modeling will test whether an erosional front propagated through the region or if pulses of erosion resulted from localized tectonic forcing, such as motion on the Nari Yun Chu Rift.",

            "abstract": "The MGVF has a total area of ca. 40,000 km2 and is well known for being the host of the only two monogenetic volcanoes in Mexico that were born in historical times: Jorullo (1759–1774) and Paricutin (1943–1952). Another particularity of the MGVF is its high number of eruptive vents with over 1000 small monogenetic cones and associated lava flows (average vol. of 0.021 km3) and ca. 400 medium-sized volcanoes (average vol. from 0.5 to 50 km3). Most of these medium-sized volcanoes may be characterized as shields that were produced dominantly by effusive activity as opposed to the small cones formed also by explosive phases of activity. The products of the small cones range from olivine basalts to andesites whereas the medium-sized volcanoes are restricted to a smaller compositional range in the andesitic domain. Although the medium-sized volcanoes are more sparsely distributed in time and space and less abundant than the small cones, the risks associated with renewal of this type of activity should not be neglected. This study focuses on El Metate which is probably the youngest shield of the MGVF (< 3,700 y. BP). Unlike a typical shield volcano composed of a succession of thin fluid basaltic flows, El Metate consists of well-preserved >60 m thick andesite flows distributed radially around a summit dome. Detailed mapping and sampling allowed us to reconstruct its eruptive activity and the time sequence of lava flow emplacement. We have identified 13 individual lava flows with lengths ranging between 3 and 15 km covering 103 km2 and average thicknesses between 60 and 150 m. Individual volumes range between 0.5 and 3.5 km3 for a total of 11 to 15 km3. Estimates of flow emplacement parameters indicate maximum average effusion rates ranging between 15 and 100 m3.s-1 and a cumulative duration from 15 to 30 years. Such a short emplacement time is comparable to the historical monogenetic eruption of nearby Paricutin volcano (9 years) but the erupted volume of lava is considerably larger (>11 km3 vs. ca. 0.8 km3). The young age of this eruption bears important implications, especially for evaluating future hazards in the MGVF. Furthermore, this study widens the use of the term “shield” and “monogenetic”, usually attributed to low-viscosity basaltic volcanoes, to more silicic compositions and a radically different flow emplacement style.",

            "abstract": "Rivers, although inherently dynamic, have been chosen as political boundaries since the beginning of colonization for several reasons. Such divisions were chosen namely for their defensive capabilities and military benefits, and because they were often the first features mapped out by explorers. Furthermore, rivers were indisputable boundaries that did not require boundary pillars or people to guard them. However, it is important to understand the complexities of a river as a boundary. All rivers inevitably change over time through processes such as accretion, deposition, cut-off, or avulsion, rendering a political boundary subject to dispute. Depending upon the flow, size, and surrounding land, a river will migrate differently than others. As these natural features migrate one country loses land while another gains land leading to tension between legal rigidity and fluid dynamism. This in turn can manifest in social disruption due to cultural differences, political upheaval, or conflict risk as a result of scarce water resources.\nThe purpose of this research is to assess the temporal and spatial variability of the political boundaries of Peru that follow rivers. Peru shares borders with Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador. A large part of its northern border with Colombia follows the Putumayo River and later the Amazon River. Part of its eastern border with Brazil follows the Yavari River and later the Yaquirana River. These rivers are natural features used as political boundaries yet they differ in how each migrates. By means of a spatial and temporal analysis of satellite images it was possible to obtain erosion and deposition areas for the Putumayo River, the portion of the Amazon River that is part of the Peruvian boundary, the Yavari River, and the Yaquirana River. The erosion and deposition areas were related to land distribution among Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. By examining the Digital Elevation Model one can see how the altitude of the surrounding land affects the watersheds and thus better understand the dynamic of rivers.\nUltimately, this research combines data regarding the morphodynamics of these rivers with historical insight on border treaties in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of political implications and social repercussions of dynamic boundaries.",

We investigated the source contributions through inverse modeling using GOME-2 observations (2007-2012) and the GEOS-Chem model. The observed high glyoxal to HCHO column ratio over the region indicates the potential presence of a direct source of glyoxal rather than secondary production. A bimodal seasonal cycle of glyoxal concentrations was found, providing further evidence for a biogenic origin of glyoxal emission. The estimate of the primary glyoxal emission over the eastern equatorial Pacific is 20-40Tg/yr, which is comparable to the previous estimate of the global continential glyoxal emission.",

We quantified changes in total archaea and bacteria, as well as deeply-branching archaeal taxa with depth. These sediment cores alternate between high and low salinities, following a glacial cycle. This allows changes in the quantities of these groups to be placed in the context of potentially vastly different organic matter sources. In addition, single cells were isolated, and their genomes were amplified and sequenced to allow a deeper look into potential physiologies of uncultured deeply-branching organisms found up to 86 meters deep in marine sediments. Together, these data provide deeper insight into the relationship between microorganisms and their organic matter substrates in this extreme environments.",

            "abstract": "Understanding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in fractured bedrock aquifers requires detailed characterization of the discrete features that control flow, as well as the properties of the rock matrix. This requires multiple, high-resolution, depth discrete datasets that provide different, but complementary information. Distributed fibre optic sensing is a relatively new technology used to continuously monitor properties along the entire length of an optical fibre. Technological advances over the past few years have brought the sensitivity and spatial resolution to the point where shallow (<200m) borehole applications are practicable.\nRecent studies using fibre optic distributed temperature sensors (DTS) have shown excellent application of DTS for characterizing groundwater flow in both continuously sealed and open boreholes. This presentation highlights the results of a field trial at the Bedrock Aquifer Research Station on the University of Guelph campus (Ontario, Canada) where a single fibre optic cable was interrogated by both a DTS (Ultima-DTS) and a Distributed Acoustic Sensor (iDAS). DAS is a relatively recent development that allows an optical fibre to be used as a receiver for seismic imaging. These seismic images are produced by sending an optical pulse down the fibre and analyzing the effects of seismic waves on the propagating light. Numerous vertical seismic profiles were collected and the effects of different fibre optic cable structures and coupling techniques were examined. The seismic profiles will help delineate structural features and lithological contacts away from the borehole wall, and will assist in correlating other geophysical, hydraulic, or geological logs collected in the boreholes across the site. Preliminary results show promise for shallow seismic imaging and continued field trials will allow refinement of the technique.",

Despite its geomorphic significance, the factors that preconditioned the Currituck slope for failure remain poorly understood. We present an integrated analysis of new high-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles acquired by the USGS, multibeam bathymetry data, and 1980s vintage industry MCS profiles. The Currituck slope appears to be made up of multiple failure events. Bathymetry data show evidence for multiple surface scarps, while the MCS data suggest there are additional buried scarps within the Pleistocene section. A ~500-m-thick section of relatively intact strata is observed across a 10 x 18 km swath of the lower slope and adjacent to the primary slide evacuation zone. Within this section, chaotic mass transport deposits are sandwiched between parallel reflectors, suggesting older landslides occurred along the upper slope prior to the most recent episode of slope failure. Plio-Pleistocene strata imaged below the main Currituck slide surface display seaward divergence and little to no evidence for buried submarine canyons, suggesting that the Currituck slope was progradational prior to failure. In contrast, the slope to the north and south of Currituck is heavily canyonized and Plio-Pleistocene depocenters are concentrated on the upper rise, suggesting these regions were dominated by sediment bypass and erosion. 3-D mapping of allostratigraphic surfaces imaged in industry MCS profiles reveal significant spatial variation in the antecedent margin morphology that may have set the stage for the accumulation of unstable Plio-Pleistocene depocenters. Upper Miocene strata to the north and south of Currituck show an angular shelf-edge and steep upper slope, whereas the Currituck region displays a rounded and gentle shelf-edge/upper slope. The gentler slope profile may have allowed for preferential sediment accumulation.",

We have tracked these changes over southeastern New York for the past 20+ years and can show a clear link to road density as an explanatory factor for local concentrations. The unexpected findings center around retention of Cl in streams and shallow groundwaters long after the winter season has passed and this can result in average summertime concentrations as high as monthly mean concentrations during the snoa and ice season. These persisten concentrations have consequences for aquatic life as well as local water resources. Literature suggests these high summer values may cause harm to some sensitive organisms.Experiments show both susceptibility and adaptation by local stream algal communities. Analysis of reported data from private drinking water wells shows a sub-set has Cl levels above the EPA secondary standard and these exceedances are apparently associated with local salt application rates. The problems of rising salt are significant given the magnitude of salt release to the environment but also tractable in the sense that there are multiple motivations for minimizing application rates while maintaining public safety. The salinization issue has also proven a useful tool for public engagement since the problem is widespread yet comprehensible.",

New and updated emission inventories are continuously being developed by research groups and agencies, reflecting both improving knowledge and actual changes in emissions. Timely incorporation of this new information into atmospheric models is crucial but can involve laborious programming.\nHere, we present the Harvard–NASA Emission Component version 1.0 (HEMCO), a stand-alone software component for computing emissions in global atmospheric models. HEMCO determines emissions from different sources, regions, and species on a user-defined grid and can combine, overlay, and update a set of data inventories and scale factors, as specified by the user through the HEMCO configuration file. New emission inventories at any spatial and temporal resolution are readily added to HEMCO and can be accessed by the user without any preprocessing of the data files or modification of the source code. Emissions that depend on dynamic source types and local environmental variables such as wind speed or surface temperature are calculated in separate HEMCO extensions.\nBy providing a widely applicable framework for specifying constituent emissions, HEMCO is designed to ease sensitivity studies and model comparisons, as well as inverse modeling in which emissions are adjusted iteratively. So far, we have implemented HEMCO in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS-5) along with its integrated data assimilation system.",

            "abstract": "The orientation of seismic anisotropy inferred beneath the interiors of plates may provide a means to estimate the motions of the plate relative to the deeper mantle. Here we analyze a global set of shear-wave splitting data to estimate plate motions and to better understand the dispersion of the data, correlations in the errors, and their relation to plate speed.\nThe errors in plate motion azimuths inferred from shear-wave splitting beneath any one tectonic plate are shown to be correlated with the errors of other azimuths from the same plate. To account for these correlations, we adopt a two-tier analysis: First, find the pole of rotation and confidence limits for each plate individually. Second, solve for the best fit to these poles while constraining relative plate angular velocities to consistency with the MORVEL relative plate angular velocities. Our preferred set of angular velocities, SKS-MORVEL, is determined from the poles from eight plates weighted proportionally to the root-mean-square velocity of each plate. SKS-MORVEL indicates that eight plates (Amur, Antarctica, Caribbean, Eurasia, Lwandle, Somalia, Sundaland, and Yangtze) have angular velocities that differ insignificantly from zero. The net rotation of the lithosphere is 0.25±0.11º Ma-1 (95% confidence limits) right-handed about 57.1ºS, 68.6ºE. The within-plate dispersion of seismic anisotropy for oceanic lithosphere (σ=19.2°) differs insignificantly from that for continental lithosphere (σ=21.6°). The between-plate dispersion, however, is significantly smaller for oceanic lithosphere (σ=7.4°) than for continental lithosphere (σ=14.7°). Two of the slowest-moving plates, Antarctica (vRMS=4 mm a-1, σ=29°) and Eurasia (vRMS=3 mm a-1, σ=33°), have two of the largest within-plate dispersions, which may indicate that a plate must move faster than ≈5 mm a-1 to result in seismic anisotropy useful for estimating plate motion.",

Thematically, the Atlas includes updated long-term assessments of the physical, biological, environmental, economic and living marine resource characteristics that indicate baseline conditions of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. These data are crucial components of integrated ecosystem assessments and modeling and support restoration and monitoring efforts in the Gulf. A multi-agency executive steering committee including members from international, federal, state, and non-governmental organizations was established to guide Atlas development and to contribute data and expertise. The Atlas currently contains over 235 maps in 70 subject areas. Each map plate is accompanied by a descriptive summary authored by a subject matter expert and each data set is fully documented by metadata in Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)-compliant standards. Source data are available in native formats and as web mapping services (WMS). Datasets are also searchable through an accompanying Map Catalog and RSS feed. The Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas is an operational example of the philosophy of leveraging resources among agencies and activities involved in geospatial data as outlined in the US Department of Interior and FGDC \"Geospatial Platform Modernization Roadmap v4 - March 2011”. We continue to update and add datasets through existing and new partnerships to ensure that the Atlas becomes a truly ecosystem-wide resource.",

            "abstract": "During periods of northward IMF, an absence of low latitude reconnection at the magnetopause is expected. However, this gives rise to questions as to how the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) can be populated with magnetosheath-like plasma under northward IMF conditions. Multi-spacecraft observations have shown the existence of Ultra-Low Frequency waves at the magnetopause that are thought to be results of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability (Miura, 1982). These K-H waves can grow into non-linear waves and form rolled-up vortices. It has been postulated that magnetic reconnection within these vortices may be responsible for the transfer of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere (e.g. La Belle-Hamer et al., 1988; Nykyri and Otto, 2001; Hasegawa et al., 2004; Bavassano Cattaneo et al., 2010). Thus, high temporal resolution plasma observations sufficient to resolve reconnection signatures inside K-H vortices (e.g.) are key to understanding how reconnection bursts contribute to coupling of the magnetosheath plasma with magnetosphere.\nWe study an event in Dec 2006, in which Cluster encountered on-going K-H waves as the spacecraft were inbound and crossed the Earth’s dusk flank magnetopause through the LLBL. During this event, the spacecraft were operating in burst mode, and the magnetic field remained closely aligned with the spacecraft spin axis. Thus we have used the 3D particle data to reconstruct near-full pitch angle distribution of electrons and ions at sub-spin resolution (0.125s c.f., 4s spin resolution). These observations, up to 32 times faster than normal mode data, provided new insight into particle dynamics during the outbound movements of Cluster across the magnetopause. We present observations of regions where boundary plasma was traveling faster than bulk magnetosheath velocity, which is a plasma signature indicative of rolled up K-H vortices. Within these vortices, we show evidence of reconnection, which consist of D-shape accelerated ion population, field-aligned magnetosheath electrons along with anti-field-aligned magnetospheric electrons. We discuss the ramifications of this result in context for the soon to be launched MMS mission.",

            "abstract": "The release of gases from the Earth’s interior to the exosphere takes place in both volcanic and non-volcanic areas of the planet. Fully understanding this complex process requires the integration of geochemical, petrological and volcanological data. At present, major online data repositories relevant to studies of degassing are not linked and interoperable.\nWe are developing interoperability between three of those, which will support more powerful synoptic studies of degassing. The three data systems that will make their data accessible via the DECADE portal are: (1) the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program database (GVP) of volcanic activity data, (2) EarthChem databases for geochemical and geochronological data of rocks and melt inclusions, and (3) the MaGa database (Mapping Gas emissions) which contains compositional and flux data of gases released at volcanic and non-volcanic degassing sites. These databases are developed and maintained by institutions or groups of experts in a specific field, and data are archived in formats specific to these databases.\nIn the framework of the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing (DECADE) initiative of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), we are developing a web portal that will create a powerful search engine of these databases from a single entry point. The portal will return comprehensive multi-component datasets, based on the search criteria selected by the user. For example, a single geographic or temporal search will return data relating to compositions of emitted gases and erupted products, the age of the erupted products, and coincident activity at the volcano.\nThe development of this level of capability for the DECADE Portal requires complete synergy between these databases, including availability of standard-based web services (WMS, WFS) at all data systems. Data and metadata can thus be extracted from each system without interfering with each database’s local schema or being replicated to achieve integration at the DECADE web portal. The DECADE portal will enable new synoptic perspectives on the Earth degassing process. Other data systems can be easily plugged in using the existing framework. Our vision is to explore Earth degassing related datasets over previously unexplored spatial or temporal ranges.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission was successfully launched at 1837 UTC 27 February 2014 with the first space-borne Ku/Ka band Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar and a passive microwave radiometer (channels ranging from 10-183 GHz). The primary objective of the Core satellite is to measure rain and snow globally, determine its 3D structure, and act as the calibration satellite for a constellation of GPM passive microwave satellites. In order to assess how remotely sensed precipitation can be applied to a range of data applications, ground validation (GV) field campaigns are crucial. As such, the Olympic Mountains Experiment (OLYMPEX) is planned for November 2015 – February 2016. The Olympic Peninsula in Washington State is an ideal location to conduct a GV campaign. It is situated within an active mid-latitude winter storm track and receives among the highest annual precipitation amounts in North America. In one compact area, the Olympic peninsula ranges from ocean to coast to land to mountains. It contains a permanent snowfield and numerous associated river basins. This unique venue will enable the field campaign to monitor both upstream precipitation characteristics and processes over the ocean and their modification over complex terrain. The scientific goals of the OLYMPEX field campaign include physical validation of satellite algorithms, precipitation mechanisms in complex terrain, hydrological applications, and modeling studies. In order to address these goals, a wide variety of existing and new observations are planned. These include surface observing networks of meteorological stations, rain and snow gauges, surface microphysical measurements, and snowpack surveys. Several radars will be deployed including the NASA S-Band dual-polarimetric and NASA Dual-Frequency Dual-Polarimetric Doppler radars, the Canadian x-band radar, and other mobile radars. Several instrumented aircraft are likely to participate such as the NASA DC-8 and the University of North Dakota Citation. The aircraft measurements will determine upstream thermodynamic and moisture conditions, sample particle types and sizes, and act as a proxy for the satellite itself. The ground-based measurements will test how well the satellite proxy measurements determine the rain and snow over complex terrain.",

            "abstract": "A recent study (Young et al. 2011) investigated recent global trends in mean and extreme (90th- and 99th-percentile) wind speed and wave height. Wentz and Ricciardulli (2011) have criticized the study, citing the methodology solely employing data collected from a series of altimetry missions and lack of adequate verification of the results. An earlier study (Wentz et al. 2007) had differing results using data from microwave radiometers and scatterometers. This study serves as a response to these studies, employing a similar methodology but with a different set of data. Data collected from the QuikSCAT and ADEOS-2 SeaWinds scatterometers, SSMI(S), and TOPEX/POSEIDON and JASON-1 altimetry missions are used to calculate trends in the mean, 90th-, and 99th-percentile wind speed and wave height over the period 1999—2009. Linear regression analyses from the satellite missions are verified against regression analyses of data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Temporal sampling presents the most critical consideration in the study. The scatterometers have a much greater independent temporal sampling (about 1.5 observations per day per satellite) than the altimeters (about 1 observation per 10 days). With this consideration, the satellite data are also used to sample the wind speeds in the ERA-Interim dataset. That portion of the study indicates the sampling requirements needed to accurately estimate the trends in the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\nWentz, F.J., L. Ricciardulli, K. Hilburn, and C.

            "abstract": "Sophisticated numerical tools exist for modeling geomorphic processes and linking them to tectonic and climatic systems, but they are often seen as inaccessible for users with an exploratory level of interest. We have improved the accessibility of landscape evolution models by producing a simple graphics user interface (GUI) that takes advantage of the Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD) model. Model access is flexible: the user can edit values for basic geomorphic, tectonic, and climate parameters, or obtain greater control by defining the spatiotemporal distributions of those parameters. Users can make educated predictions by choosing their own parametric values for the governing equations and interpreting the results immediately through model graphics. This method of modeling allows users to iteratively build their understanding through experimentation. Use of this GUI is intended for inquiry and discovery-based learning activities. We discuss a number of examples of how the GUI can be used at the upper high school, introductory university, and advanced university level. Effective teaching modules initially focus on an inquiry-based example guided by the instructor. As students become familiar with the GUI and the CHILD model, the class can shift to more student-centered exploration and experimentation. To make model interpretations more robust, digital elevation models can be imported and direct comparisons can be made between CHILD model results and natural topography. The GUI is available online through the University of Maine’s Earth and Climate Sciences website, through the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) model repository, or by contacting the corresponding author.",

            "abstract": "Proxy-based reconstructions of past climate have played an integral role in assessments of historical climate change, and tree-ring widths (TRW) have a long history of use in this paleoclimate research due to their annual resolution, widespread availability, and sensitivity of growth processes to variation in temperature and water availability. Increasingly, studies have shown that additional tree-ring metrics—including earlywood and latewood widths (EW and LW, respectively), maximum latewood density, and the intensity of reflected blue light from latewood (BI)—can provide additional information on seasonal climatic variability that is not present in TRW alone due to different processes that affect growth in different parts of the growing season. Studies of these additional tree-ring metrics highlight their utility in climate reconstructions, but to date they have mostly been limited to a few tree species and regions. Here, we extend the range of previous studies on alternative tree-ring metrics by evaluating the seasonal climate signals in TRW, EW, LW, and BI of Pinus ponderosa at six semiarid sites surrounding the Columbia River basin in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). Cores from each site were cross-dated and EW, LW, and TRW were measured using standard dendrochronological procedures. BI was obtained using a high-resolution flatbed scanner and CooRecorder software. To evaluate the unique climate processes and seasonalities contributing to different dendrochronological metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation from each site were obtained from the PRISM climate model and were correlated with each of the tree-ring metrics using the MATLAB program SEASCORR. We also evaluate the potential of using multiple tree-ring metrics (rather than a single proxy) in reconstructions of precipitation in the PNW. Initial results suggest that 1) tree growth at each site is water-limited but with substantial differences among the sites in the strength and seasonality of correlations between precipitation and tree-ring metrics, and 2) EW tends to be more dependent on conditions in the prior growing season while LW tends to be related to water availability early in the current growing season. Results from this study illustrate the potential utility of multiproxy dendroclimatology for paleoclimate research.",

We also investigate the case in which there are multiple solar spectral lines near the sieve's depth of focus.

            "abstract": "Deep convection remains a challenge to accurately parameterize in global and climate models. Increases in computer power recently have allowed large-eddy simulations (LES; grid spacing of O(100 m)) of deep convection, which are beginning to increase our understanding of this unresolved issue. Our research examined the Weather Research and Forecasting model in LES mode (WRF-LES) as a potential tool to further our understanding of deep convective cloud dynamics and microphysics. Idealized and nested WRF-LESs were made for 02 September 2013, a day on which 3 aircraft from the recent NASA SEAC4RS campaign extensively sampled deep convection during all phases of its lifecycle. When modeling deep convection at the LES scale, one of the greatest uncertainties is the choice of cloud microphysical parameterization. Thus, we tested the sensitivity of the WRF-LESs to several microphysical schemes. Simulated flight tracks were used to evaluate the WRF-LESs against the dynamical and microphysical data gathered during the SEAC4RS aircraft cloud penetrations. Results indicated the importance of cloud microphysical parameterizations when making deep convective LESs, especially if they are used to develop cumulus parameterizations. Results from the idealized WRF-LESs then were used to “tune” a real-data run in which the WRF-LES domain was nested within a mesoscale domain. This multi-scale nesting of an LES provides a framework for making detailed simulations of case studies when high-resolution observed data are available for evaluation. This nesting approach also might provide a new method, which uses more realistic atmospheric forcing for the LES, to develop cumulus parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "The ability of a microbe to persist in low-nutrient environments requires adaptive mechanisms to survive. These microorganisms must reduce metabolic energy and increase catabolic efficiency. For example, Escherichia coli surviving in low-nutrient extended stationary phase have mutations that confer a growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype, thus allowing for persistence for years in low-nutrient environments. Based on the fact that subseafloor environments are characterized by energy flux decrease with time of burial we hypothesize that cells from older (deeper) sediment layers will have more altered genomes compared to sequenced surface relatives and that these differences reflect adaptations to a low-energy flux environment. To test this hypothesis, sediment samples were collected from the Andaman Sea from the depths of 21, 40 and 554 meters below seafloor, with the ages of 0.34, 0.66, and 8.76 million years, respectively. A single operational taxonomic unit within Firmicutes, based on full-length 16S rDNA, dominated these low diversity samples. This unique feature allowed for metagenomic sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq to identify nucleotide variations (NV) between the subsurface Firmicutes and the closest sequenced representative, Bacillus subtilis BEST7613. NVs were present at all depths in genes that code for proteins used in energy-dependent proteolysis, cell division, sporulation, and (similar to the GASP mutants) biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids. Conserved genes such as 16S rDNA did not contain NVs. More NVs were found in genes from deeper depths. These NV may be beneficial or harmful allowing them to survive for millions of years in the deep biosphere or may be latent deleterious gene alterations that are masked by the minimal-growth status of these deep microbes. Either way these results show that microbes present in the deep biosphere experience environmental forcing that alters the genome.",

            "abstract": "We spatially analyze the control over evapotranspiration (ET) imposed by soil moisture across the United States using daily estimates of satellite-derived soil moisture and data-driven ET over a nine-year period (June 2002-June 2011) at 305 locations. The soil moisture data are developed using 0.25-degree resolution satellite observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), where the 9-year time series for each 0.25-degree pixel was selected from three potential algorithms (VUA-NASA, U. Montana, & NASA) based on the maximum mutual information between soil moisture and precipitation (Tuttle & Salvucci (2014), Remote Sens Environ, 114: 207-222). The ET data are developed independent of soil moisture using an emergent relationship between the diurnal cycle of the relative humidity profile and ET. The emergent relation is that the vertical variance of the relative humidity profile is less than what would occur for increased or decreased ET rates, suggesting that land-atmosphere feedback processes minimize this variance (Salvucci and Gentine (2013), PNAS, 110(16): 6287–6291). The key advantage of using this approach to estimate ET is that no measurements of surface limiting factors (soil moisture, leaf area, canopy conductance) are required; instead, ET is estimated from meteorological data measured at 305 common weather stations that are approximately uniformly distributed across the United States. The combination of these two independent datasets allows for a unique spatial analysis of the control on ET imposed by the availability of soil moisture. We fit evaporation efficiency curves across the United States at each of the 305 sites during the summertime (May-June-July-August-September). Spatial patterns are visualized by mapping optimal curve fitting coefficients across the Unites States. An analysis of efficiency curves and their spatial patterns will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The depositional age and provenance of the Liuqu Conglomerate (LC), distributed along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone (IYSZ) in South Tibet, remain controversial, leading to different interpretations, such as a Paleogene basin deposited during India-Asia collision (Wang et al., 2010) or the result of the collision between India and an intra-oceanic arc (Aitchison et al., 2007). Here, we report low-temperature thermochronometry data (apatite fission track, apatite and zircon U-Th/He) for the LC in the Xigaze area, to constrain its depositional age, provenance and burial-exhumation history. Five samples from Liuqu yielded consistent AFT ages of ~6-8Ma, and dispersed single-grain AFT ages of six samples range from ~ 140 to 5 Ma, and single grain AFT ages for grains with >0.4 Cl (wt%) content was calculated three age-peaks of ~16.4 ±3.0, 37.3 ± 6.4 and 89.5 ± 22.2 Ma. Four groups of detrital ZHe ages, including 18 scattered single grain ages in the range of ~20 - 107.9 Ma, yielded four age peaks of ~20, 37, 66 and 104 Ma. We interpret the AHe ages of the LC as having been completely thermally reset, while AFT ages have been partially annealed and ZHe ages have not been thermally reset, suggesting that the post-depositional maximum temperature of the LC was > 80 °C and < 110°C. Collectively, our results indicate that the Liuqu Conglomerate was probably deposited in the Early Miocene time, similar to the Qiuwu-Dazhuka conglomerates which are located in the northern part of the IYSZ, as one component of the Gangrinboche Group, and was derived from the Xigaze forearc basin, Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone, as well as the Tethyan Himalaya. Furthermore, the Liuqu Conglomerate was exhumed to the surface by post-depositional incision of a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo river by the Late Miocene time.\nAitchison, J. C.; Ali, J.

            "abstract": "We compare estimates of the spatial distribution of water quantity provided (annual water yield) from two ecohydrologic models: the widely-used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the much simpler water models from the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) toolbox. These two models differ significantly in terms of complexity, timescale of operation, effort, and data required for calibration, and so are often used in different management contexts. We compare two study sites in the US: the Wildcat Creek Watershed (2083 km2) in Indiana, a largely agricultural watershed in a cold aseasonal climate, and the Upper Upatoi Creek Watershed (876 km2) in Georgia, a mostly forested watershed in a temperate aseasonal climate. We evaluate (1) quantitative estimates of water yield to explore how well each model represents this process, and (2) ranked estimates of water yield to indicate how useful the models are for management purposes where other social and financial factors may play significant roles.\nThe SWAT and InVEST models provide very similar estimates of the water yield of individual subbasins in the Wildcat Creek Watershed (Pearson r = 0.92, slope = 0.89), and a similar ranking of the relative water yield of those subbasins (Spearman r = 0.86). However, the two models provide relatively different estimates of the water yield of individual subbasins in the Upper Upatoi Watershed (Pearson r = 0.25, slope = 0.14), and very different ranking of the relative water yield of those subbasins (Spearman r = -0.10). The Upper Upatoi watershed has a significant baseflow contribution due to its sandy, well-drained soils. InVEST’s simple seasonality terms, which assume no change in storage over the time of the model run, may not accurately estimate water yield processes when baseflow provides such a strong contribution. Our results suggest that InVEST users take care in situations where storage changes are significant.",

            "abstract": "Thick sections of halite (tens of meters) from the ICDP Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project core were precipitated during extremely dry periods, when the lake level was low and fresh water availability was scarce. The detailed description of the sedimentological record during periods of halite precipitation shows alternations between halite and mud with gypsum layers that are tens of cm to a few meters thick. The halite alternates between small cumulated crystals that are formed on the water surface and large bottom-growth crystals with low densities of fluid inclusion bands that are formed on the lake floor. The large crystals are associated with mud layers and show more mud between the crystals, while the small cumulate crystals have much less detritus and contain ‘halite rafts’, which are formed under high evaporation conditions.\nThe thick sections of halite cannot form only due to evaporation of the Dead Sea basin brines, and requires a continuous source of salt from fresh water input and brines discharging from the subsurface in order to facilitate the observed amount of salt over time. The salt is added and accumulated in the brines during glacials and wetter periods, when the lake level is high, and probably stratified, and then precipitates during drier periods, when the fresh water discharge into the lake decreases. Based on the chemical compositions of past Dead Sea lakes, from fluid inclusions in the halite (Na/Cl~0.3-0.6), we estimate that ~3-6 cm of halite precipitates per 1 m of lake level drop. The amount of salt in the core indicates periods of significant lake level drop (up to 100 m), represented by intervals of ~3 m of halite. The mud intervals between the halite segments indicate increases in the fresh water discharge, and possibly the formation of a stratified lake (from freshwater addition), which does not facilitate halite precipitation.\nThe discharge into the lake can be constrained according to the steady-state discharge with a certain lake level, which suggests a maximal water discharge of between 240 and 900 million m3/y. Assuming a linear relationship with precipitation, this suggests a 25-50% average precipitation relative to the present. Large variations in Br concentration in halite, Na/Cl ratios and Mg concentration in fluid inclusions, may suggest even lower lake levels, and drier conditions.",

            "abstract": "Cassini has been orbiting Saturn for over ten years now. During this epoch, the ring shadow has moved from covering a large portion of the northern hemisphere to covering a large swath south of the equator and continues to move southward. At Saturn Orbit Insertion in 2004, the ring plane was inclined by ~24 degrees relative to the Sun-Saturn vector. The projection of the B-ring onto Saturn reached as far as 40N along the central meridian (~52N at the terminator). At its maximum extent, the ring shadow can reach as far as 48N/S (~58N/S at the terminator). The net effect is that the intensity of both ultraviolet and visible sunlight penetrating into any particular latitude will vary depending on both Saturn’s axis relative to the Sun and the optical thickness of each ring system. In essence, the rings act like venetian blinds.\nOur previous work [1] examined the variation of the solar flux as a function of solar inclination, i.e. ~7.25 year season at Saturn. Here, we report on the impact of the oscillating ring shadow on the photolysis and production rates of hydrocarbons in Saturn’s stratosphere and upper troposphere, including acetylene, ethane, propane, and benzene. Beginning with methane, we investigate the impact on production and loss rates of the long-lived photochemical products leading to haze formation are examined at several latitudes over a Saturn year. Similarly, we assess its impact on phosphine abundance, a disequilibrium species whose presence in the upper troposphere is a tracer of convective processes in the deep atmosphere.\nWe will also present our ongoing analysis of Cassini’s CIRS, UVIS, and VIMS datasets that provide an estimate of the evolving haze content of the northern hemisphere and we will begin to assess the implications for dynamical mixing. In particular, we will examine how the now famous hexagonal jet stream acts like a barrier to transport, isolating Saturn’s north polar region from outside transport of photochemically-generated molecules and haze.\n [1] Edgington, S.G., et al., 2012.

Space., 118, 2876-2881], a couple of Hilbert transform relations were applied to the study of the ill-posedness for the essential GS reconstructions. In this further study, a detailed derivation for these reciprocal relations are presented in case of the plane circular region, and then the reciprocal relations are extended to apply to the plane rectangular region after a conformal mapping procedure. While for the case of plane rectangular region, it is confronted by a traditional problem of the so-called corner singularities, which divided the extended reciprocal relations into four integrals with end-point singularities. With the help of the extended Euler-Maclaurin expansion, new quadrature schemes are developed for these singular integrals. Benchmark testing with the analytic solutions on a rectangle boundary has also show the efficiency and robustness of these extensions. The new solution approach is also developed with the introduced reciprocal relations, and an iterated Tikhonov regularization scheme is applied to deal with the ill-posed linear operators appearing in the discretization of the new approach. The special case on the rectangular boundary is benchmarked with the analytic solutions. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. A robust solution approach is expected to be developed based on these new results for the GS equation on any 2D region with partial-known boundary conditions.",

Two lineages have not been genomically sampled before, while all 5 are frequently found in a variety of marine sediment habitats.

MiRS is a physically-based optimal estimation algorithm, that finds a solution by minimizing a two-term cost function: 1) the departure of the forward model simulated radiances from the satellite measurements, and 2) the departure of the retrieved parameters from their a priori information. The community radiative transfer model (CRTM) is used as both the forward and Jacobian operator in simulating the radiances, with the goal of fitting the multichannel measurements within the assumed radiometric noise levels.\nOnce, the state vector is retrieved, further post-processing is carried out to derive important hydrometeor products such as the cloud water path, ice water path, and rain water path, which are then converted to surface rain rate using a physical relationship between water path amount and surface rain rate derived from offline simulations of a mesoscale model. Additional derived geophysical products include total precipitable water from vertical moisture profiles, and the sea ice concentration and the snow water equivalent from emissivity spectra. Since, the surface emissivity is included as part of the state vector, an all-surface retrieval has been possible without compromising a smooth transition of the geophysical products across different surfaces.\nIn this presentation, several examples of retrieved geophysical parameters using the MiRS 1DVAR algorithm applied to measurements from the GMI sensor on-board the GPM core satellite will be shown. When available, comparisons with collocated independent data will be included. Moreover, the algorithm is readily applicable to both cross-track sounders and conical imagers without needing any cross-calibration of radiometric measurements between the sensors in the GPM constellation.",

With increasing urbanization (notably in developing nations) and increasing emissions, quantitative observational information on emissions of CO2 and CH4 becomes critical for improved understanding of the global carbon cycle and for carbon management/policy decisions. In this presentation, we will discuss the impact uncertainty in anthropogenic emissions has on global carbon-climate understanding, providing broad geophysical motivation for urban studies. We will further discuss observations of urban regions at different scales (satellite vs. in-situ), and investigate the information content of these complementary methods for answering targeted questions on both global carbon fluxes and regional management decisions.

            "abstract": "Fluids are major agents of mass and heat transport in the Earth crust and in subduction zones. Fluid inclusions, metasomatic field relations and experimental evidence suggest that these fluids can contain important ligands, including halogens, sulfates, sulfides, etc. The ligands participate in the complexation of rock-forming elements during mineral dissolution to high-T and P. Although models of high- element metasomatism typically assume that H2O dominates the fluid’s solvent properties, however, H2O may be a relatively minor component in the high-PT brines that are increasingly recognized in the lower crust and mantle. Understanding the evolution of solubility mechanisms as fluids change from dilute aqueous solutions to salt-rich brines is hindered by the absence of experimental investigation of this transition. To address this problem, we conducted experiments on the solubility of calcite in sodium-halide solutions at 8 kbar and 700 °C using hydrothermal piston-cylinder weight-loss methods. Investigated salts were NaL , where L=F, Cl, Br, I, at concentrations ranging from 0.15 molal to 20 molal (XNaL ~ 0.3). At these conditions, the fluid is a single supercritical fluid phase . Run durations were 4 to 20 hours. Results demonstrate systematic trends with ligand ionic size, and locate a major mechanistic transition in the vicinity of XNaL~ 0.1 for all calcite-H2O-NaL systems. At lower than this critical composition (Xcrit), calcite solubility displays a pronounced concave shape indicating involvement of water during the dissolution process. At XNaL> Xcrit , the shape becomes convex with no apparent effect of decreased H2O activity in the fluid. The solubility patterns suggest that the solvent properties are dominated by those of H2O at XNaL< Xcrit, but at XNaL> Xcrit, H2O is a solute in a solution behaving as a molten salt. Geological evidence suggests that salt concentrations may reach values similar to or greater than Xcrit in a range of metamorphic and igneous systems in the middle and lower crust. Our study implies that such fluids are best modeled as molten salt solutions, even at relatively water-rich compositions. This conclusion provides a foundation for developing models of metasomatic processes involving saline fluids in the deep crust and subduction zones.",

Of the 36 spectral bands of MODIS, five are in infrared spectral regions suitable for the derivation of SST; this is a significant improvement on the AVHRR, the heritage instrument. In addition, the spectral response functions of MODIS are narrower than those of the AVHRR, the measurements are digitized to 12-bits instead of 10, and the uncertainty in the geolocation of the pixels is much smaller. However, the complexity of the optical design of MODIS led to instrumental artifacts in the infrared measurements, the consequences of which became apparent only after launch. But corrections for these have been developed and applied, so the SST measurements are of high quality and have many applications. The presentation will review progress in developing high quality SSTs and discuss the benefits of the new Version 6 SST algorithms and the SST fields they will produce.",

            "abstract": "The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar irradiance is one of the primary energy sources into the Mars atmosphere. Photons in this wavelength range heat, dissociate, and ionize the constituents of the upper atmosphere, hence knowledge of the solar irradiance is vital in determining not only the state of the planet’s atmosphere, but its variability and potential for atmospheric escape. The solar EUV irradiance varies on all timescales and is the result of the highly variable activity on the Sun. During the primary mission of the Mars Atmosphere Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), the planet will be on a different side of the Sun than the Earth and will therefore be subjected to potentially very different irradiances than the standard Earth-based monitors can capture, particularly for short timescale variations such as on daily (active region evolution) or sub-daily (flares) scales. The EUV monitor on MAVEN measures the solar input to the Mars atmosphere with three broadband radiometers at 121-122 nm (H Ly-α), 17-22 nm, and 0-6 nm, capturing solar transition region, coronal, and flaring emissions. The EUV measurements will be at a 1-second cadence. The broadband measurements can be used as direct indicators of the timing and magnitude of solar irradiance variations. The EUV data will also be combined with interpolated Earth-based measurements using a proxy model to generate a full irradiance spectrum from 0-190 nm in1-nm bins at a 1-minute cadence for use in Mars atmospheric studies. This paper will present the EUV monitor measurements and data products and the synergies with the other MAVEN instruments and atmospheric studies.",

Structural description for cuttings/cores and stress/strain analyses based on anelastic strain recovery (ASR) and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) for core samples were performed. The followings are structural characteristics:\na) The intact cuttings include slickenlined surfaces, scaly fabric, deformation bands, minor faults and mineral veins. Scaly fabric is increasingly observed below ~2200 mbsf.\nb) The cored interval is characterized by steep bedding planes (>75˚). A fault zone with a few mm-size angular clasts is present in the core (2204.9–2205.8 mbsf).\nc) SEM images in the upper part of Hole C0002N show little evidence for opal diagenesis. The fabric lacks a strongly preferred orientation in clay-rich materials, except along striated micro-fault. Below 2625 mbsf, compaction fabrics in clay–rich materials can be observed.\nThe overall character of the deformation (independent particulate flow with limited evidence for cataclastic deformation) in the cuttings is suggestive that deformations occurred in a relatively shallow environment.\nStress analyses based on the ASR for three whole-round samples from Hole C0002P showed good curve of the strain recovery and identified vertically-oriented σ2-axes with horizontal σ1 and σ3-axes. Paleomagnetic works are still continued to detect three-dimensional stress information.\nMagnetic fabrics deduced from AMS ellipsoids show moderate flattening fabric parallel to the bedding plane (Kmin inclined perpendicular to the bedding plane). Although magnetic foliation (Kint/Kmin) decreases and Kmin-inclination is disturbed in the fault zone, magnetic lineation (Kmax/Kint) didn’t show variation, indicative of brittle deformation occurring in the fault zone. Major reduction in the mean susceptibility is identified in the fault zone, which implies chemical reaction which decreases concentration of magnetic minerals occurred along the fault zone.",

In an effort to improve estimates of future coastal change for the outer section of the Provincelands at the distal end of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, we applied a simple one-dimensional numerical model to calculate net longshore sediment transport rates for three time periods: 1833-1889, 1889-1933 and 1933-2010. Since the entire 9 km study area was within a single littoral cell and included its terminus (at Long Point), we back-calculated net transport rates from that point of no transport to estimate the transport at updrift locations throughout the study area. The results for all three time periods indicated a net alongshore transport rate on the order of 100,000 cubic meters per year entering the study area (at Race Point). However, the transport rate patterns for the three periods varied markedly, albeit consistently, throughout the study area. Regional decreases and increases in transport rates, indicating zones of net accretion and erosion, were pronounced in the earliest period, less so in the second, and almost absent in the third. We interpret these results as indicating that the study area has been evolving toward an increasingly stable morphology over the past two centuries.",

The vast majority of traditional paleoclimate simulation studies using General Circulation Models include representations of the atmosphere and ocean as well as a dynamic sea ice model. In this we study new presents model results from a GCM that also includes a detailed ocean biogeochemical scheme HadOCC. HadOCC is an ecosystem model, meaning it contains an explicit representation of planktonic species (both autotrophic phytoplankton and heterotrophic zooplankton) and is an NZPD model (Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Detritus). It is also able to simulate air-sea gas exchange and primary productivity in the surface and near-surface as well as full ecosystem interaction throughout the water column.\nCompared to the present day, the Latest Cretaceous represents a very different world, both in terms of its atmospheric composition and in the configuration of the continents. It also offers the prospect of studying a past warm climate with significantly enhanced CO2 levels compared to the preindustrial era. For the simulations presented here, atmospheric CO2 levels are set to be four times their preindustrial values (290 parts per million).\nThe combination of a very different continental configuration and hugely enhanced atmospheric CO2 levels results in a very different climate from what we know today. To first order, ocean temperatures are significantly higher and circulation patterns are very different. The combination of these fundamentally important ocean properties means that the resulting biological activity (which will be shown in an annual mean and seasonal sense) is able to provide clues as to which oceanic areas were more biologically active than others. Because of the fully dynamic and coupled nature of the biology and physics of this modelling framework, surface and benthic processes (and their interactions) can be studied without the need for inference concerning the connection between the two. It is hoped that this presentation will stimulate future collaborations between modellers and experimentalists and will also be of use for future targeted drilling cruises.",

            "abstract": "The vision of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is the achievement of societal benefits through voluntary contribution and sharing of resources to better understand the relationships between the society and the environment where we live. The GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI) allows users to search, access, and use the resources contributed by the GEOSS members.\nThe GEO DAB (Discovery and Access Broker) is the GCI component in charge of interconnecting the heterogeneous data systems contributing to GEOSS. Client applications (i.e. the portals and apps) can connect to GEO DAB as a unique entry point to discover and access resources available through GCI, with no need to implement the many service protocols and models applied by the GEOSS data providers. The GEO DAB implements the brokering approach (Nativi et al., 2013) to build a flexible and scalable System of Systems.\nUser authentication/authorization functionality is becoming more and more important for GEOSS data providers and users. The Providers ask for information about who accessed their resources and, in some cases, want to limit the data download. The Users ask for a profiled interaction with the system based on their needs and expertise level. Besides, authentication and authorization is necessary for GEOSS to provide moderated social services – e.g. feedback messages, data “fit for use” comments, etc.\nIn keeping with the GEOSS principles of building on existing systems and lowering entry-barriers for users, an objective of the authentication/authorization development was to support existing and well-used users’ credentials (e.g. Google, Twitter, etc.).\nDue to the heterogeneity of technologies used by the different providers and applications, a broker-based approach for the authentication/authorization was introduced as a new functionality of GEO DAB. This new capability will be demonstrated at the next GEO XI Plenary (November 2014).\nThis work will be presented and discussed.\nRefenrences\nNativi, S.; Craglia, M.; Pearlman, J., \"Earth Science Infrastructures Interoperability: The Brokering Approach,\" Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, IEEE Journal of , vol.6, no.3, pp.1118,1129, June 2013",

            "abstract": "CELiS (Compact Eyesafe Lidar System) is an elastic lidar system conceived for the purpose of monitoring air quality environmental compliance regarding particulate matter (PM) generated from off-road use of wheeled and tracked vehicles. CELiS is a prototype instrument development by the Space Dynamics Laboratory to demonstrate a small, low power, eye-safe lidar system capable of monitoring PM fence-line concentration of fugitive dust from off-road vehicle activity as part of the SERDP (Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program) Measurement and Modeling of Fugitive Dust Emission from Off-Road Department of Defense Activities program.\nCELiS is small, lightweight and easily transportable for quick setup and measurement of PM concentration and emissions. The instrument is mounted on Moog Quickset pan and tilt positioner. Ground support equipment includes portable racks with laser power and cooler, power supplies, readout electronics and computer. The complete CELiS instrument weighs less than 300 lbs., is less than 1 cubic meters in volume and uses 700 W of 120V AC power. CELiS has a working range of better than 6km and a range resolution of 1.5m-6m.\nCELiS operates in a biaxial configuration at the 1.5μm eyesafe wavelength. The receiver is an off-axis parabolic (OAP) telescope, aft-optics and alignment assembly and InGaAs APD detector readout. The transmitter is a 20Hz PRF - 25mJ Quantel 1.574 μm laser with a 20x beam expander. Both the receiver and transmitter are mounted on a carbon fiber optical breadboard with a custom mounting solution to minimize misalignment due to thermal operating range (0-40 C) and pointing vectors.\nAny lidar system used to monitor fence-line PM emissions related to off-road training activities will be subject to a strict eye-safety requirement to protect both troops and wildlife. CELiS is eyesafe at the output aperture.\nCELiS has participated in two Dugway Proving Ground Lidar exercises performing within expectations. Retrieval of particulate matter concentration is presented in companion poster by K. Moore.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental goal of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) is to enable investigation of the role that small, short-term strain transients play in the release of accumulated stress along fault zones. The detection of slow earthquakes along the San Andreas in the 1990’s and the discovery of Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events in Japan and Cascadia in the following years suggested that fault slip modes could span the temporal range from seismic to slow-deformation processes. Strainmeters provide the sensitivity required to detect short-term, nanostrain-level transients and so for this reason clusters of co-located strainmeters and seismometers were included in the PBO design. Arrays of strainmeters, each forming a mini fault observatory, were installed along the San Jacinto Fault, the creeping section of the central San Andreas, in the Eastern California Shear Zone, in two volcanic zones, Mt St Helens and Yellowstone and a regional scale network was built along the Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust fault. Currently the network consists of 75 borehole and 6 long baseline strainmeters. Since the installation of the first strainmeter in 2005 the instruments have provided unprecedented temporal resolution of multiple creep events along the central section of the San Andreas, post-seismic transients in Anza and ETS events in Cascadia,\nUNAVCO generates Earthscope Level 2 data products for the strainmeters. These include models for the earth tides, barometric responses, long-term borehole trends plus areal and shear strain time-series. Processed time-series are updated automatically every 24 hours and a follow-up data set reviewed by a data engineer is released every 7 to 10 days. Site information, data quality assessment, strain plots and time-series data for all PBO strain instruments can be obtained from the UNAVCO strain and seismic web page (http://www.unavco.org/data). In this presentation we will highlight some of the strain transients these instruments have measured, outline the processing steps required to extract these subtle transient signals from the data, and describe the strainmeter data products available UNAVCO including newly implemented web services.",

            "abstract": "McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, is characterized by two particular geophysical processes. (1) Marine ice accretion supplies most of the ice shelf material rather than meteoric ice from glacier outflow and snow-falls. (2) A brine layer infiltrates the ice shelf laterally up to 20-km inward. The infiltration mainly initiates at the ice-front from sea water percolation when the firn/snow transition is below sea-level. A better characterization of the McMurdo ice shelf could constrain our knowledges of these mechanisms and assess the stability of the region that hosts numerous human activities from the close McMurdo station (USA) and Scott base (New-Zealand). McMurdo ice shelf is also an analog for the Jovian icy moon Europa where brine pockets are supposed to reside in the ice crust and accretion to occur at the 10-30-km deep ice-ocean interface.\nThe University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) acquired two radar survey grids over the McMurdo Ice Shelf during southern summers 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 with the High Capability Radar Sounder (HiCARS) on-board a Basler DC-3 aircraft. HiCARS transmits a chirped signal at 60-MHz central frequency and 15-MHz bandwidth. The corresponding vertical resolution in ice is 5-10 m. An important design goal of the radar was to maintain sufficient dynamic range to correctly measure echo intensities.\nHere we present the brine infiltration extent and bathymetry derived from its dielectric horizon well distinguishable on the HiCARS radargram. We complement the ice-shelf characterization by classifying its surface thanks to the novel Radar Statistical Reconnaissance (RSR) methodology. The RSR observable is the statistical distribution of the surface echo amplitudes from successive areas defined along-track. The distributions are best-fitted with a theoretical stochastic envelop parameterized with the signal reflectance and scattering. Once those two components are deduced from the fit, they are used in a backscattering model to invert surface properties such as roughness, density, and/or impurity load. This combined analysis gives new insights into the superficial processes and exchanges at the McMurdo ice shelf.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience programs that focus on long-term waste management in the geosphere commonly aim to develop a conceptual model that explains porewater residence time and the mechanisms and time scales for solute transport. Diffusion is the dominant transport process in low-permeability rocks so measurement of rock diffusion properties is important, but measurements at the laboratory scale can be highly variable due to changes in lithology, porosity, confining pressure and pore-fluid composition at scales of cm to 10’s of m. The natural analogue approach, using tracers such as Cl, Br, 18O and 2H that commonly display conservative behaviour, provides a means to scale up the results of laboratory measurements to understand the larger-scale controls on porewater residence time and solute transport. The principal challenge in applying this approach is the difficulty of obtaining high-quality tracer concentration data from porewater in low-permeability rocks. Additional insight into solute transport and reaction processes could be gained by collecting data for the concentrations of major cations but these data are even more difficult to obtain. Using data from the geoscience site characterization for the Ontario Power Generation proposed Deep Geologic Repository at the Bruce site in southwest Ontario, this presentation will illustrate some of the problems with standard methods for obtaining porewater compositional data . Methods such as core squeezing and advective displacement simply do not work because the permeability and the water content are too low. The crush-leach method has been used but is susceptible to artifacts from dissolution of soluble minerals (halite, anhydrite, gypsum and celestite), ion exchange and difficulty in assigning a porosity value to specific solutes. In order to overcome these limitations and improve the outcome from the natural analogue approach, a new method has been developed that extracts porewater directly into hydrophyllic cellulosic paper by placing it in direct contact with the rock. Results will be presented to demonstrate that this method has potential to provide high-quality data for major cations, anions and porewater isotope systems (18O, 2H, 87Sr/86Sr) of interest, thereby extending the use of the natural analogue technique to a greater range of solute tracers.",

            "abstract": "We investigate how river long profiles and their knickzones and knickpoints interact with uplift (i.e. base level fall) rate and lithology. These results highlight lithogenic controls on knickpoint evolution. First, based on dated and regionally correlated incision markers from West Africa, we reconstructed the entire paleo-long profiles of big rivers such as the Niger at ca. 24, 11 and 6 Ma, as well as the Eocene topography those rivers have dissected. Though spatially and temporally variable, incision remained mostly below 10 m/my with a mean around 5 m/my. The spatial stability of both the river outlets and divides imposed maintenance or increasing concavity of the river long profiles through time, resulting from spatially contrasted adjustment of river segments bounded by recurrent lithogenic knickzones that persisted since 24 Ma. Drainages evolved preferentially by very slow slope decrease or uniform incision in between the stationary knickzones of evolving amplitude, with apparently no relation to base level change. Therefore, knickzone height or position may not simply reflect the transient response of big rivers to base level fall as predicted by stream-power incision river models. Second, we study river profiles experimentally on an 80 cm-long and 2 cm-wide flume filled with a ‘bedrock’ cohesive paste made of silica flour mixed with water and kaolinite. Water is introduced from one extremity at a constant discharge to erode the bedrock. Uplift rate is controlled by a sliding gate at the outlet of the flume while the properties of the bedrock evolve by changing the percentage of kaolinite. During the experiment, knickpoints cyclically migrate upstream. At the foot of the knickpoint face, bedrock is over-eroded to form a plunging pool. The eroded kaolinite is washed away while the silica is rapidly deposited downstream to form a sediment layer whose slope adjusts to the flow regime. A new knickpoint will not be created until the stream removes this layer and carves into the bedrock, providing a nice example of self-organization along the profile. The rate of knickpoint retreat is rather constant with increasing uplift rate and diminishes with increasing bedrock strength. Rather than increasing knickpoint velocity, the profile adapts to increasing uplift rate by increasing the rate of knickpoint creation.",

            "abstract": "La Gloria Pluton (LGP) is a 10 Ma shallow elongated NNW reservoir of 17 km length and 4-6 km width as part of a NS trend of Miocene plutons in Central Chile. New LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages in zircons of La Gloria Pluton indicate that crystallization occurs mostly within an interval between 11.2 to 10 Ma, with southeastward decreasing ages. Zircon crystallization ages are consistently older at the boundaries of the pluton than at the center for a given cross-section. At regional scale the ages of LGP follows a plutonic trend of southward decreasing age: Estero Yerba Loca (10 Ma) and San Francisco Batholith (SFB), in the north; and Cerro Mesón Alto (12.5 Ma) and San Gabriel (SG; 13 Ma), in the south. Both regional and local (within-LGP) age trends suggest: 1) a progressive northward migration of the main deep magmatic source during the Miocene; and 2) a southeastward lateral propagation of the magma during the reservoir construction. The lateral propagation of the magma is also supported by subhorizontal mineral and magnetic lineations with a preferred NNW orientation within LGP.\nThe within-pluton age distribution and internal configuration suggest incremental construction with horizontal propagation of magma within channels. Because the lateral migration of the magma play an important role on the thermal structure of the cooling pluton we perform numerical simulations that account for reheating caused by refilling along the axial core of the pluton . We speculate that pre-existing shallow crustal structures (faults and folds) would allow lateral magma canalization, particularly between the lower highly deformed volcanic Abanico Fm. and the less deformed overlaying volcanic Farellones Fm. The pluton distribution and internal organization in and around LGP suggest incremental construction with vertical and horizontal migration of magma within channels and reservoirs, yielding plutonic complexes with protracted ages and elongated geometries.",

Regulations designed to address these impairments can be costly, raising questions about the value of the public benefits that would result from additional investments in improving surface water quality. Benefit studies often rely on costly surveys or other detailed data collection, limiting the ability to apply nonmarket valuation methods to address policy needs. We assessed the recreational value of changes in water quality using freely-available geotagged photographs as a proxy for recreational visits to lakes. We find that improved water clarity is associated with greater lake photo-visitation and that lake users are willing to travel further to visit clearer lakes. We estimate a one-meter increase in lake clarity in Minnesota and Iowa lakes is associated with $22 in increased willingness-to-pay per trip and generates 1,400 additional annual visits per lake, holding all other lake attributes constant.

            "abstract": "Predictions of future climate depend strongly on trends in net uptake or release of carbon by the land biosphere. However, model estimates of the strength of the net global land sink during the Industrial Era vary widely. Here we evaluate results from an ensemble of uncoupled models taken from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) and forced by the same input fields. When compared to estimates inferred from atmospheric CO2 observations (i.e., fossil fuel emission + net land use change - atmospheric increase - ocean uptake), MsTMIP models estimate, on average, a stronger global net land uptake of carbon (e.g., -0.3 to 8.7 Pg C/yr from 2000 to 2010, where a negative flux represents a net release to the atmosphere). Some models consistently show the land surface as a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, which is inconsistent with the other terms in the global anthropogenic CO2 budget. In addition, regional differences in land carbon exchange are compared across models and to estimates derived from atmospheric inversions and inventory based approaches. Using the semi-factorial simulations of the MsTMIP activity, we examine how model estimates of the cumulative global net land sink diverge over the period 1900 to 2010, and the degree to which model sensitivity to forcing factors contribute to this divergence. We link differences in estimates of the cumulative land sink back to each model’s sensitivity to climate variability, CO2 fertilization, nitrogen limitation, and net land-use change. Throughout the 110-year time period, the strength of carbon uptake in most models appears to be strongly sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations (CO2 fertilization effect). The strength of this relationship, however, varies across models depending on model structure (e.g., stronger CO2 fertilization effect in models without an interactive nitrogen cycle with N limitations) and across decades (e.g., strong sensitivity of net flux to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations after 1970s).\nhttp://nacp.ornl.gov/MsTMIP.shtml\nHuntzinger et al.

            "abstract": "High mountain lakes of the Sierra Nevada are excellent indicators of anthropogenic global change due to their limited capacity to buffer acid deposition, their sensitivity to changes in snowpack dynamics and their oligotrophic nutrient status. In this presentation, we examine long-term records of hydrochemistry and biological monitoring at the Emerald Lake watershed to assess whether high elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada are changing in response to climate change or changes in atmospheric deposition of nutrients and acid. To provide a broader context for these changes, we augment these long-term records with results from paleolimnological analysis that examines changes in nutrient status and acid buffering capacity of Sierra Nevada lakes over the past two millennia. Our research suggests that, although atmospheric deposition is the dominant driver of twentieth century ANC trends, aquatic communities in the Sierra Nevada are responding to combined effects from acidification, climate change, and eutrophication. Early in the twentieth century the primary stressor effecting Sierra Nevada lakes was acid deposition driven by SO2 emissions. As the century and industrialization progressed, NOx levels increased adding a eutrophication stressor while simultaneously contributing to acidification. Effects were further complicated by a warming climate in the late twentieth century, as warmer temperatures may have contributed to the recovery of ANC in lakes via increased weathering rates, while simultaneously enhancing eutrophication effects.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting rainfall in areas with sparse monitoring efforts is critical to making inferences about the health of ecosystems and built environments. Recent advances in scientific computing have allowed forecasting and climate models to increase their spatial and temporal resolution. Combined with observed point precipitation from monitoring stations, these models can be used to inform dynamic spatial statistical models for precipitation using methods from geostatistics and machine learning.\nTo prove the feasibility, process, and capabilities of these statistical models, we present a case study of two statistical models of precipitation for the Amazon River basin from 2003-2010 that can infer a spatial process at a point using areal data from numerical model output. We investigate the seasonality and accumulation of rainfall, and the occurrence of no-rainfall and large-rainfall events. These parameters are used since they provide valuable information on possible model biases when using climate models for forecasts of the future process of precipitation in the Amazon basin. This information can be vital for ecosystem, agriculture, and water-resource management.\nWe use observed precipitation data from weather stations, three areal datasets derived from observed precipitation (CFSR, CMORPH-CRT, GPCC) and three climate model precipitation datasets from CMIP5 (MIROC4h, HadGEM2-CC, and GISS-E2H) to construct the models. The observational data in the model domain is sparse, with 195 stations in the approximate 7×106 square kilometers of the Amazon basin, and therefore requires the areal data to create a more robust model.\nThe first model uses the method of Bayesian melding to combine and make inferences from the included data sets, and the second uses a regression model with spatially and temporally-varying coefficients. The models of precipitation are fitted using the areal products and a subset of the point data, while another subset of point data is held out for verification. The statistical models are evaluated based on the predictive performance using metrics such as mean absolute errors and coverage of predictive intervals. Precipitation estimates from the climate models are also evaluated on the basis of their performance in analyzing the accumulation, seasonality, and occurrence of rainfall.",

            "abstract": "The structural, magmatic and metamorphic characteristics of Archean greenstone belts and associated TTG (tonalite, trondhjemite and granodiorite) gneisses in southern West Greenland are comparable to those of Phanerozoic convergent plate margins, suggesting that Archean continents grew mainly at subduction zones. These greenstone belts are composed mainly of tectonically juxtaposed fragments of oceanic crust including mafic to ultramafic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks. Volcanic rocks in the greenstone belts are characterized mainly by island arc tholeiitic basalts, picrites, and boninites. The style of deformation and geometry of folds in 10 cm to 5 m wide shear zones are comparable to those occur on 1 to 50 km scale in the greenstone belts and TTG gneisses, suggesting that compressional tectonic processes operating at convergent plate boundaries were the driving force of Archean crustal accretion and growth. Field observations and trace element data suggest that Archean continental crust grew through accretion of mainly island arcs and melting of metamorphosed mafic rocks (amphibolites) in thickened arcs during multiple tectonothermal events. Fold patterns on cm to km scale are consistent with at least three phases of deformation and multiple melting events generating TTG melts that intruded mainly along shear zones in accretionary prism and magmatic arcs. It is suggested that Archean TTGs were produced by three main processes: (1) melting of thickened oceanic island arcs; (2) melting of subducted oceanic crust; and (3) differentiation of basaltic melts originating from metasomatized sub-arc mantle wedge peridotites.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) global full electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are used in order to analyze the cusp region within the frame of the global solar wind- terrestrial magnetosphere interaction when the Interplanetary Magnetcic Field (IMF) is in a northward configuration. Recent results of PIC simulations (Cai et al., 2014) have recovered the general expected features of the cusp issued from both previous experimental and MHD simulation results. One new striking feature was the evidence of an Alfven transition layer (ATL) almost adjacent to the upper edge of the stagnant exterior cusp (SEC), through which the plasma flow transits from super (from magnetosheath) to sub-(to SEC) Alfvenic regime in a good agreement with experimental data statistics performed by Lavraud and al. (2005) but not mentionned in MHD results. In complement to these experimental results, present simulations displayed in the image show that (i) the ATL largely extends out of the upper cusp region until even reaching the subsolar region, (ii) the ATL presents some assymetry around the meridian plane ; (iii) it has a 3D structure which is analyzed in details (not performed before); (iv) the middle region of the ATL (3D) located above the upper cusp presents a depletion where its width is much thinner and corresponds to a privilegied region where large plasma flows are observed which suggests strong local plasma precipitation. We take advantage of the 3D PIC simulations in order to analyze carfefully this area and plasma précipitation, and to separate plasma flows passing through the nearby reconnection lobes located along the magnetopause (and above the ATL) from those which do not. The main goal is to establish a link between the 3D dynamic of the reconnection lobes and of the upper cusp region.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of lithospheric rheology and the necessity to resolve the deformation patterns near the free surface (faults and folds) sufficiently well places a great demand on a stable and scalable modeling tool that is capable of efficiently handling nonlinearities. Our code LaMEM (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model) is an attempt to satisfy this demand.\nThe code utilizes a stable and numerically inexpensive finite difference discretization with the spatial staggering of velocity, pressure, and temperature unknowns (a so-called staggered grid). As a time discretization method the forward Euler, or a combination of the predictor-corrector and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta can be chosen. Elastic stresses are rotated on the markers, which are also used to track all relevant material properties and solution history fields. The Newtonian nonlinear iteration, however, is handled at the level of the grid points to avoid spurious averaging between markers and grid. Such an arrangement required us to develop a non-standard discretization of the effective strain-rate second invariant. Important feature of the code is its ability to handle stress-free and open-box boundary conditions, in which empty cells are simply eliminated from the discretization, which also solves the biggest problem of the sticky-air approach – namely large viscosity jumps near the free surface. We currently support an arbitrary combination of linear elastic, nonlinear viscous with multiple creep mechanisms, and plastic rheologies based on either a depth-dependent von Mises or pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager yield criteria.\nLaMEM is being developed as an inherently parallel code. Structurally all its parts are based on the building blocks provided by PETSc library. These include Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov nonlinear solvers with convergence globalization techniques (line search), equipped with different linear preconditioners. We have also implemented the coupled velocity-pressure multigrid prolongation and restriction operators specific for staggered grid discretization. The capabilities of the code are demonstrated with a set of geodynamically-relevant benchmarks and example problems on parallel computers.\nThis project is funded by ERC Starting Grant 258830",

            "abstract": "During subduction, prograde metamorphism leads to the disappearance of Fe3+-rich phases in serpentinites (mostly magnetite and lizardite). This redox reaction is accompanied with a decrease of Fe3+/FeTot ratio in serpentinites and a release of fluid mobile elements (e.g. B, S) but little is known about the iron mobility in fluids during subduction. We investigate this problem with an isotopic study of Fe in serpentinites from Western Alps ophiolites. These samples record different metamorphic conditions modelling a subduction gradient that allow deciphering the impact of prograde metamorphism on the Fe isotopic composition of serpentinites during subduction.\nAt mid-oceanic ridges, ultramafic rocks are serpentinized by interaction with seawater derived fluids. This process leads to the replacement and oxidation of ferromagnesian minerals (olivine and orthopyroxene) to Fe3+-rich lizardite and magnetite (Liz-serpentinite). Mantle peridotites commonly display δ56Fe between -0.1 and +0.1 ‰ while Liz-serpentinites display a δ56Fe ranging from -0.09 to +0.04 (± 0.03)‰, which could potentially reflect interactions with low-δ56Fe hydrothermal fluids. During subduction, from greenschist to blueschist facies, the transition lizardite to antigorite leads to a progressive disappearance of magnetite and a reduction of Fe in serpentine. This redox reaction is accompanied with an increase of δ56Fe from +0.03 to +0.13‰. At eclogite facies, fully recrystallized Atg-serpentinites display a δ56Fe ranging from +0.14 to +0.20‰ while partly dehydrated serpentinites composed of antigorite, secondary olivine and chlorite display a lower δ56Fe ranging from -0.03 to +0.03‰.\nOur results show that, during the first 70 km of subduction, the transition lizardite to antigorite conduct to the formation of a serpentinite with a high δ56Fe value that can be accompanied with the loss of a low δ56Fe fluid. The increase of δ56Fe in serpentinites is correlated with a decrease of Fe3+/FeTot ratio suggesting that the main factor controlling Fe isotopic fractionation during the transition lizardite to antigorite is the oxidation state. At greater depth, antigorite breakdown is accompanied with a reduction of iron in serpentinites and a decrease of δ56Fe suggesting that release fluids could have a high δ56Fe value.",

To better understand its sedimentation, denudation, and mountain building history; we conduct a detailed magnetostratigraphic study on the Dashankou section in the Kashi Depression of the Tarim Basin. Paleomagnetic samples were collected from 985 sites of a 3187m-thick section from the exposed Neogene sediments. Magnetostratigraphy is correlating with polarity chrons C5r.3r to C2An.1n dated between ~12.4 and ~3.0 Ma on the GTS2012 geomagnetic polarity time scale. The substantial increase in accumulation rate in the Dashankou section at ~6.7 Ma may be the signature of a pulse of rapid uplift comparable to that observed in the northern Chinese Tianshan Mountains. We argue that climatic changes may have modulated the sedimentary record during the Neogene times, but they don’t appear to be a dominant control on sediment accumulation between ~7.0 and ~2.58 Ma. On the other hand, the basal age of the Xiyu Conglomerates studied here is ~3.2 Ma, and the accumulation rate of the Late Pliocene conglomerates was mostly controlled by both tectonics and climatic cooling. Our results indicate that the present high relief of the Tianshan Mountains is the result of dominant phases of uplift at ~6.7 Ma and the Early Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have a profound influence on air quality and climate, but large uncertainties exist in modeling SOA on the global scale. In this study, five SOA parameterization schemes, including a two-product model (TPM), volatility basis-set (VBS) and three cloud SOA schemes (Ervens et al. (2008, 2014), Fu et al. (2008) , and He et al. (2013)), are implemented into the global chemical transport model (MOZART-4). For each scheme, model simulations are conducted with identical boundary and initial conditions. The VBS scheme produces the highest global annual SOA production (close to 35 Tg·y-1), followed by three cloud schemes (26-30 Tg·y-1) and TPM (23 Tg·y-1). Though sharing a similar partitioning theory to the TPM scheme, the VBS approach simulates the chemical aging of multiple generations of VOCs oxidation products, resulting in a much larger SOA source, particularly from aromatic species, over Europe, the Middle East and Eastern America. The formation of SOA in VBS, which represents the net partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds from vapor to condensed phase, is highly sensitivity to the aging and wet removal processes of vapor-phase organic compounds. The production of SOA from cloud processes (SOAcld) is constrained by the coincidence of liquid cloud water and water-soluble organic compounds. Therefore, all cloud schemes resolve a fairly similar spatial pattern over the tropical and the mid-latitude continents. The spatiotemporal diversity among SOA parameterizations is largely driven by differences in precursor inputs. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the evolution, wet removal, and phase partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds, particularly above remote land and oceanic areas, is critical to better constrain the global-scale distribution and related climate forcing of secondary organic aerosols.",

            "abstract": "In recent spacecraft observations, coherent electrostatic solitary wave (ESWs) structures are observed in various regions of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Over the years, many researchers have attempted to model these observations in terms of electron/ion acoustic solitary waves by using nonlinear fluid theory/simulations. The ESW structures predicted by fluid models can be inadequate due to its inability in handling kinetic effects. To provide clear view on the application of the fluid and kinetic treatments in modeling the ESWs, we perform both fluid and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of ion acoustic solitary waves (IASWs) and estimate the quantitative differences in their characteristics like speed, amplitude, and width. It is noted that a long time evolution of Gaussian type perturbations in the equilibrium electron and ion densities generated the nonlinear IASW structures in both fluid and PIC simulations. The IASW structures represent vortices of trapped electrons in PIC simulations. We find that the number of trapped electrons in the wave potential is higher for the large amplitude IASW, which are generated by large-amplitude initial density perturbation (IDP). The present fluid and PIC simulation results are in close agreement for small amplitude IDPs, whereas for large IDPs they show discrepancy in the amplitude, width, and speed of the IASW, which is attributed to negligence of kinetic effects in the former approach. The speed of IASW in the fluid simulations increases with the increase of IASW amplitude, while the reverse tendency is seen in the PIC simulation. The present study suggests that the fluid treatment is appropriate to model the IASW observations when the magnitude of phase velocity of IASW is less than the ion acoustic (IA) speed obtained from their linear dispersion relation, whereas when it exceeds IA speed, it is necessary to include the kinetic effects in the model.",

            "abstract": "A multitude of actual processes operating on hydrological networks may exhibit binary outcomes such as clean streams in a river network that may become contaminated. These binary outcomes can be modeled by node removal processes (attacks) acting in a network. Network robustness against attacks has been widely studied in fields as diverse as the Internet, power grids and human societies. However, the current definition of robustness is only accounting for the connectivity of the nodes unaffected by the attack. Here, we put forward the idea that the connectivity of the affected nodes can play a crucial role in proper evaluation of the overall network robustness and its future recovery from the attack. Specifically, we propose a dual perspective approach wherein at any instant in the network evolution under attack, two distinct networks are defined: (i) the Active Network (AN) composed of the unaffected nodes and (ii) the Idle Network (IN) composed of the affected nodes. The proposed robustness metric considers both the efficiency of destroying the AN and the efficiency of building-up the IN. This approach is motivated by concrete applied problems, since, for example, if we study the dynamics of contamination in river systems, it is necessary to know both the connectivity of the healthy and contaminated parts of the river to assess its ecological functionality. We show that trade-offs between the efficiency of the Active and Idle network dynamics give rise to surprising crossovers and re-ranking of different attack strategies, pointing to significant implications for decision making.",

            "abstract": "River deltas are intricate landscapes with complex channel networks that self-organize to deliver water, sediment, and nutrients from the apex to the delta top and eventually to the coastal zone. The natural balance of material and energy fluxes which maintains a stable hydrologic, geomorphologic, and ecological state of a river delta, is often disrupted by external factors causing topological and dynamical changes in the delta structure and function. A formal quantitative framework for studying river delta topology and transport dynamics and their response to change is lacking. Here we present such a framework based on spectral graph theory and demonstrate its value in quantifying the complexity of the delta network topology, computing its steady state fluxes, and identifying upstream (contributing) and downstream (nourishment) areas from any point in the network. We use this framework to construct vulnerability maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to the shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds of upstream links. This enables us to evaluate which links (hotspots) and what management scenarios would most influence flux delivery to the outlets, paving the way of systematically examining how local or spatially distributed delta interventions can be studied within a systems approach for delta sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Ripples are directly influenced by the intensity and direction of near bed flow. Ripple geometric response to unidirectional or oscillatory dominant forcing has definable characteristics respective to each regime, but is less understood in conditions of combined forcing, specifically orthogonal wave and mean current forcing. Previous studies (e.g. Smyth and Li, 2005; Lacy et al., 2007) have suggested that increasingly divergent orientation in wave and current forcing may increase ripple crest sinuosity (meandering). This, in turn, affects ripple migration and ripple defect generation and density (Faraci and Anderson, 2002). In similar fashion, seabed objects, through scour and current steering, may affect ripple morphology, disrupting ripple migration and serving as nodal points for ripple defect generation. With the Fingerprint Algorithm imagery analysis technique (Skarke and Trembanis, 2011), it is now possible to effectively quantify spatial-temporal evolution of ripple morphology from acoustic imagery. Using in situ hydrodynamic and acoustic imagery data from near-shore instrument moorings, this study investigates the influence of combined flow on ripple sinuosity patterns and the relationship of sinuosity to ripple defect location and density. Further, it examines defect density with respect to proximity and orientation to seabed objects, and considers specific characteristics of object influence on ripple migration patterns. Initial findings suggest ripple defect density increases in area of increased ripple crest sinuosity and near seabed objects.",

            "abstract": "The POLENET-ANET project is simultaneously resolving crustal motions, measured by GPS, and earth structure and rheological properties, mapped by seismology. Measured vertical and horizontal crustal motion patterns are not explained by extant glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models. These models have ice histories dominated by ice loss following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and rely on 1D earth models, with rheological properties varying only radially. Seismological results from POLENET-ANET are revealing significant complexity in lateral variation in earth properties. For example, crustal thickness variations occur not only across the East-West Antarctic boundary, but also between crustal blocks within West Antarctica. Modeling of mantle viscosity based on shear wave velocities shows a sharp lateral gradient from high-to-low viscosity in the Ross Embayment, a much more gradual gradient in the Weddell Embayment, and very low viscosities below Marie Byrd Land and the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE). Remarkable vertical and horizontal bedrock crustal motion velocity magnitudes, directions and patterns correlate spatially, in many aspects, with earth property variations mapped by seismology.\nWithin the ASE, extremely high upward velocities are flanked by subsiding regions – neither predicted by GIA models. Given the thin crust and low mantle viscosity, it is likely that this is not an LGM signal, which would have already relaxed, and uplift due to the elastic response to modern ice mass change clearly is important. Along the East-West Antarctic boundary in the Ross Embayment, GIA-induced horizontal crustal motions are toward, rather than away from, the principal ice load center, correlating spatially with the strong lateral gradient in crustal thickness and mantle viscosity. In the Weddell Embayment region, where crustal thickness is intermediate between East and West Antarctica and mantle viscosity values are moderate, crustal motions show the best match with predictions of GIA models. It is clear that lateral variations in earth properties fundamentally control the isostatic response to ice mass changes in Antarctica. Ongoing, integrated seismic-GPS studies are critical to developing the next generation of GIA models.",

            "abstract": "We present a preliminary quaternary slip-rate study on the Van fault, the source of the 2011 Mw7.1 reverse-slip earthquake which caused heavy damage to the cities of Van and Ercis, eastern Turkey. From the InSAR solution, we see a strong depth cut-off at 10km depth, above which there was no slip on the fault. We have carried out an investigation of the geomorphological expression of the fault in quaternary material, to determine whether the fault reaches the surface and, if so, whether this upper section could fail in an earthquake. On the western segment of the Van fault, we observe quaternary scarps coincident with the surface projection of the fault segment identified by InSAR, which displace quaternary alluvial fan and lake-bed deposits. These are coincident with the observation of fault gouge in quaternary deposits at a road cutting, providing evidence for a fault reaching the surface and suggesting that the upper section is capable of rupturing seismically. We use structure-from-motion photogrammetry, differential GPS and terrestrial LiDAR to determine offsets on two generations of fault scarps, and the creep offsets from the period following the earthquake. Preliminary radiocarbon and OSL dates from two uplifted terrace surfaces allow us to estimate a late quaternary geological slip-rate for the fault. Following the GPS and InSAR solution of Dogan et al. 2014 (GRL v41,i7), we also present field evidence and satellite image observations confirming the presence of a splay fault within the northern suburbs of Van city, which experienced creep following the 2011 earthquake. This fault is observed to be particularly evident in the early high resolution satellite imagery from the declassified CORONA missions, highlighting the potential for these datasets in identifying faults in areas now covered by urban sprawl. It remains unclear whether this fault could fail seismically. The fault which failed in 2011 is a north dipping reverse fault, unmapped prior to the earthquake. We identify similar geomorphological structures in the surrounding region, highlighting the need for further detailed tectonic mapping of the region.",

In recent decades, large scale peatland fire has occurred frequently in that region, in which many areas of peatland were reclaimed with intention to use the land for forest plantation and rice paddy. We conducted a plot-scale peat burning experiment to elucidate the characteristics of gaseous carbon emission from a tropical peatland fire at the ground level.\nThe experimental site was established at an open area 20 km southeast from Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The size of the burning plot is 4 m in length and 3 m in width. Gas samples were collected at heights of 1.0, 0.5, 0.0 (aboveground), −0.1 and −0.2 m (belowground) through stainless steel and/or aluminum tubes settled across the edge of the plot. The concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4) and particulate matter (PM) was determined. Soil temperature was recorded every 10 minutes 0.1 and 0.2 m below the ground surface. Twelve iron rods were installed in 1-m by 1-m square grid to determine the depth of burn scar.\nAfter ignition, flaming stage of peat burning was ceased within 1-2 hours. The following smoldering stage continued for a week. In the flaming stage, soil temperature at −0.1 m increased tentatively. After the smoldering stage began, the temperature rapidly increased to 350–450°C. Response of soil temperature at −0.2 m was less prominent. Concentrations of gaseous components became maximal in the flaming stage. During the smoldering stage, the concentrations gradually decreased. The influence of burning on CO2 and PM was prominently remained at −0.1 m, whereas those at −0.2 m were not so much. The averaged burnt depth was 5.8±5.1 cm. Based on bulk density of 0.22 g/cm3 and carbon content of 55.5%, the amount of carbon lost from the plot was 85.3 kg. Most of the gaseous carbon was evolved as CO2. The second major emission form was CO, which increased from 7% in the flaming stage to about 20% in the smoldering stage. The proportions of CH4 and PM were consistently small.",

            "abstract": "The Advanced Simulation Capabililty for Environmental Management (ASCEM) program is developing an approach and open-source tool suite for standardized risk and performance assessments at legacy nuclear waste sites. These assessments begin with simplified models, and add geometric and geologic complexity as understanding is gained. The Platform toolsets (Akuna) generates these conceptual models and Amanzi provides the computational engine to perform the simulations, returning the results for analysis and visualization.\nIn this presentation we highlight key elements of the design, algorithms and implementations used in Amanzi. In particular, the hierarchical and modular design is aligned with the coupled processes being sumulated, and naturally supports a wide range of model complexity. This design leverages a dynamic data manager and the synergy of two graphs (one from the high-level perspective of the models the other from the dependencies of the variables in the model) to enable this flexible model configuration at run time. Moreover, to model sites with complex hydrostratigraphy, as well as engineered systems, we are developing a dual unstructured/structured capability. Recently, these capabilities have been collected in a framework named Arcos, and efforts have begun to improve interoperability between the unstructured and structured AMR approaches in Amanzi. To leverage a range of biogeochemistry capability from the community (e.g., CrunchFlow, PFLOTRAN, etc.), a biogeochemistry interface library was developed called Alquimia.\nTo ensure that Amanzi is truly an open-source community code we require a completely open-source tool chain for our development. We will comment on elements of this tool chain, including the testing and documentation development tools such as docutils, and Sphinx. Finally, we will show simulation results from our phased demonstrations, including the geochemically complex Savannah River F-Area seepage basins.",

In 2001, the two-ice-breaker mission AMORE (RV POLARSTERN and USCGC HEALY) detected hydrothermal plumes and evidence for seafloor venting associated with volcanic ridges rising from the rift valley floor of 4.2 km depth (Edmonds et al., 2003; Michael et al., 2003). The AURORA expedition in July 2014 (RV POLARSTERN Cruise PS86) targeted this “Aurora” field at the SW limit of Gakkel Ridge, to investigate its habitats, communities and their energy sources. No robots can yet be deployed through ice-cover to explore such deep habitats and ice-breaking research vessels cannot hold position in the thick multiyear ice. Instead, we estimated ice-drift to predict suitable start positions, then attached POLARSTERN to a matching ice floe, to achieve the bottom trajectories that we required for targeted exploration. The Aurora mount is volcanic in origin formed from mounded pillow basalts overlain by about a meter of sediment and cut through by steep cliffs revealing basalt pillows in outcrop and in talus piles. We identified persistent plume activity in the water column above the mount at 3100-3600 m (800-300 m off-bottom of its top) characterized by anomalies in turbidity, Eh, methane, temperature, density, and elevated microbial chemoautotrophic activity. Using a towed camera-, and multisensor- platform (OFOS) we located active venting as the source of this plume together with inactive chimneys and associated craters on the SW flank of Mt.Aurora. Its dominantly filter-feeding fauna is apparently sustained by venting of energy-rich fluids and microbial transfer of this geofuel into nutrition. This communication presents first results of our recent fieldwork and experimental investigations in Summer 2014 to explore deep-sea ecosystems in ice-covered oceans.",

            "abstract": "To understand the spatial and temporal distribution of deformation (e.g., underplating and exhumation of metamorphic rocks) and earthquakes in subduction zones, it is important to constrain the rheological properties of metamorphic rocks (i.e., altered oceanic crust and sediments), and how they evolve during metamorphic reactions following hydration, carbonation and dehydration of the down-going slab.\nWe conducted triaxial deformation experiments on three mafic schists with various peak metamorphic conditions: a lawsonite-blueschist, a greenschist, and an epidote-amphibole schist, using Griggs-type solid pressure- medium apparatus. Constant strain rate experiments and strain rate stepping experiments were conducted at confining pressures (Pc) from 0.76-2GPa, temperatures (T) from 300-600C and strain rates from 10-5-10-71/s.\nAt a confining pressure of 1 GPa, temperature of 400C and strain rate of 10-5 1/s, differential stresses σd for all mafic schists were higher than 1 GPa. The lawsonite-blueschist and greenschist samples were weaker than epidote-amphibolite samples under all experimental conditions. All types of samples exhibit high stress exponent (> 15) and strain rate strengthening; frictional behavior that inhibits earthquake nucleation. Differential stress increased with increasing confining pressure, while friction coefficient decreased with increasing confining pressure and temperature. The nominal friction coefficient for the lawsonite-blueschist and the greenschist samples was 0.3 to 0.35, values which predict stresses below the Goetze criterion (σd < Pc). Microstructures of recovered samples showed modest buckling and several localized shear zones. These features suggest that the deformation of mafic schist is accommodated by semi-brittle deformation resulting in strain localization on faults. Such weak and aseismic fault zones in subducting slab might promote detachment of oceanic crust from the subducting slab and allow underplating to forearc crust.",

One crucial activity is a biophysical suitability assessment for AWD in the three countries. For this, we analyzed rainfall and soil data as well as potential evapotranspiration to assess if the water balance allows practicing AWD or if precipitation is too high for rice fields to fall dry.\nIn my talk I will outline key factors for a successful large-scale implementation of AWD with a focus on the biophysical suitability assessment.

            "abstract": "NASA Earth science observations, models, analyses, and applications made significant contributions to numerous aspects of the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA) report and are contributing to sustained climate assessment activities. The agency’s goal in participating in the NCA was to ensure that NASA scientific resources were made available to understand the current state of climate change science and climate change impacts. By working with federal agency partners and stakeholder communities to develop and write the report, the agency was able to raise awareness of NASA climate science with audiences beyond the traditional NASA community. To support assessment activities within the NASA community, the agency sponsored two competitive programs that not only funded research and tools for current and future assessments, but also increased capacity within our community to conduct assessment-relevant science and to participate in writing assessments. Such activities fostered the ability of graduate students, post-docs, and senior researchers to learn about the science needs of climate assessors and end-users, which can guide future research activities. NASA also contributed to developing the Global Change Information System, which deploys information from the NCA to scientists, decision makers, and the public, and thus contributes to climate literacy. Finally, NASA satellite imagery and animations used in the Third NCA helped the pubic and decision makers visualize climate changes and were frequently used in social media to communicate report key findings. These resources are also key for developing educational materials that help teachers and students explore regional climate change impacts and opportunities for responses.",

            "abstract": "The Nile River is the longest in the world with a length of 6,800 km. However, the contrast between the length of the river or the size of the basin and the comparatively small volume of basin runoff generated is a unique feature of the Nile Basin. Due to non-availability of in-situ hydrologic data, we do not clearly understand the spatial distribution of hydrologic sources and sinks and how much they control input–output dynamics? In this study, we integrated satellite-derived precipitation, and modeled evapotranspiration data (2000–2012) to describe spatial variability of hydrologic sources and sinks in the Nile Basin. We also used long-term gridded runoff and river discharge data (1869–1984) to understand the discrepancy in the observed and expected flow along the Nile River. Results indicate that over 2000–2012 period, 4 out of 11 countries (Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) in the Nile basin showed a positive water balance while three downstream countries (South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt) showed a negative balance. The top three countries that contribute most to the flow are Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. The study revealed that ~85% of the runoff generated in the Equatorial region is lost in an inter-station basin that includes the Sudd wetlands in South Sudan; this proportion is higher than the reported loss of 50% at the Sudd wetlands alone. The loss in runoff and flow volume at different sections of the river tend to be more than what can be explained by evaporation losses, suggesting a potential recharge to deeper aquifers that are not connected to the Nile channel systems. On the other hand, we also found that the expected average annual Nile flow at Aswan is larger (97 km3) than the reported amount (84 km3). Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass deviation in storage data analysis showed that at annual time-scales, the Nile Basin shows storage change is substantial while over longer-time periods, it is minimal (<1% of basin precipitation). Due to the large variations of the reported Nile flow at different locations and time periods, the study recommends increased hydro-meteorological instrumentation of the basin. This study improves our understanding of the spatial dynamics of water sources and sinks in the Nile basin and identified emerging hydrologic questions that require further attention.",

            "abstract": "Simultaneous heliospheric observations of particles, fields, and plasma on closely connected interplanetary magnetic field lines at large (~AU) distances from one another have large potential for addressing many critical science problems in Heliophysics. These include investigations into particle acceleration and transport, the magnetic structure of the inner heliosphere, and solar wind turbulence. We have determined that spacecraft launched from Earth towards Mars and Venus following a Hohmann minimum energy transfer trajectory provide such opportunities as they have a strong tendency to remain well-connected magnetically to Earth (L1) via the Parker magnetic field in the heliosphere. Along with the finding that magnetic connections also established on the return journeys we refer to this circumstance as the Hohmann-Parker effect. Thus, IMAP placement at L1 would have obvious advantages for human exploration missions to and from Mars. In particular the early mission phases of current and future science missions such as MSL, MAVEN, Solar Orbiter, Mars 2020 and beyond provide opportunities for Heliophysics science gain. We already have predicted and confirmed consequences of the effect as correlated high-energy particle parameters at L1 and MSL. We will reiterate predictions and make WSA-ENLIL simulations for the MAVEN s/c orbital path during its transfer from Earth to Mars in 2013/2014. Moreover, we predict the existence of Hohmann-Parker resonance orbits that reestablish HP-effect conditions and evaluate and compare the science value of various resonance orbits. Smallsat missions on such resonance orbits in combination with IMAP would in the future provide us with enormous recurring science potential to solve key Heliophysics science questions.",

            "abstract": "Accurate dating of fossil shorelines is essential for establishing chronology related to paleo sea level changes, providing insight into past climates, paleo ice volumes and local dynamic topography. Biogenic carbonate is a particularly useful tool for dating marine terraces, as they record chemical signatures of seawater at the time of formation. However, the primary geochemical methods (marine Sr isotopes, U-series disequilibrium, and U-Pb dating) used to date shallow water fauna older than the late Pleistocene are often subject to open system effects, such as diagenesis (recrystallization and meteoric weathering). This is especially problematic for Sr isotope dating during the Mid-Pliocene, when the 87Sr/86Sr seawater calibration curve shows small changes over time, and small variations in 87Sr/86Sr ratios correspond to large uncertainties in ages. To identify pristine carbonate material that generates reliable seawater Sr isotope ratios, we examined different species of Plio-Pleistocene bivalves and corals from various geographic locations and environments by combining optical images, scanning electron microscope (SEM), cathodoluminescence and x-ray diffraction (XRD) with elemental and Sr isotope analyses of micro-drilled calcite and aragonite layers within individual organisms. The results from this study will help to evaluate the effect of secondary diagenesis and recrystallization on trace element abundances and Sr isotope ratios. Using these methods, we show that reliable ages can be achieved using the Sr isotope seawater curve.",

            "abstract": "The characteristics of a typical CO2 storage system allow simplification strategies for reactive transport simulations based on process decoupling. In such systems the feedback of the slow chemical reactions to hydrodynamics is low until the system reaches a substantial hydrodynamic equilibrium. Furthermore, the presence of CO2 is the main driving force for chemical reactions, which are for most reactants kinetically controlled. Hence, the same reaction path is substantially replicated in all elements of the grid exposed to the injected CO2, either in gaseous or in dissolved form. The analysis of\nfully coupled 3D simulations of the Ketzin pilot site for CO2 storage performed with the TOUGHREACT simulator confirms these hypotheses to a large extent, both in homogeneous and in heterogeneous settings. This allows the definition of a simplified one-way coupling combining independent non-reactive hydrodynamic and batch geochemical models. The exposure time to CO2 of each grid element is estimated by the conservative simulations, then the outcome of one single geochemical model per lithofacies is applied to each grid element. A threshold value for the minimum concentration of dissolved CO2 required to start chemical reactions permits to mitigate the discrepancy due to the lack of a mass balance between the independently run simulations. The comparison with fully coupled simulations validates the novel approach. The simplified coupling can tackle a wide class of problems, not only CO2 storage; it allows calculating reactive chemistry on grids comprising millions of elements, overcoming a major limitation of reactive transport models, which are often bounded to 2D radial domains. This is particularly advantageous in highly heterogeneous settings with complex hydrodynamics. The new coupling is demonstrated at full scale for the Ketzin site with simulations up to 15000 years, a result which cannot yet be achieved by fully coupled simulations.",

            "abstract": "Active plate boundaries are an excellent environment for studying the relative importance of stress sources because their relatively high strain rates and frequent earthquakes provide a wealth of information on the orientation of the stress field and the spatio-temporal variations in crustal strain accumulation. Using southern California as a natural laboratory, we combine models of stress accumulation (fault loading) along the various segments of the southern San Andreas Fault System (SAFS), constrained by geodetic observations, with a uniform horizontal stress field representing a regional tectonic driving stress. The loading time on individual faults within the system, as well as the magnitude and orientation of the principal driving stresses, are adjusted so that the orientation of the total stress tensor is in alignment with the observed in situ stress orientation, as determined from an inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms. Because stress tensor orientation can only constrain the relative magnitude of stress contributions, an additional stress contribution from topography supported in the crust is included so that the resulting total stress field model includes both orientation and a lower bound on magnitude. The optimal stress model, comprised of contributions from topography, fault loading, and regional driving stress, predicts a maximum horizontal principal stress (SHmax) that agrees with focal mechanisms to within the 15º across 75% of the region. The optimal model requires 1) the regional driving stress to be closely aligned to the observed SHmax direction with a differential stress of at least 42 MPa at seismogenic depth, and 2) a loading time of at least 2000 years on the main segments of the SAFS, reflecting a temporal signal that spans multiple earthquake cycles. This suggests earthquakes on these fault segments achieve somewhat less than complete release of the accumulated stress from fault loading, such that the shallow crust is near-critically stressed throughout the earthquake cycle. This has important implications for understanding intraplate seismicity because it supports the assertion that relatively small stresses from unconventional sources could play an important role in determining the timing and location of seismic activity in a critically stressed upper crust.",

            "abstract": "The ability to evaluate the cosmic ray environment at Mars is of interest for future manned exploration. To support exploration, tools must be developed to accurately access the radiation environment in both free space and on planetary surfaces. The primary tool NASA uses to quantify radiation exposure behind shielding materials is the space radiation transport code, HZETRN. In order to build confidence in HZETRN, code benchmarking against Monte Carlo radiation transport codes is often used. This work compares the dose calculations at Mars by HZETRN and the GEANT4 application, Planetocosmics. The dose at ground and the energy deposited in the atmosphere by galactic cosmic ray protons and alpha particles has been calculated for the Curiosity landing conditions. In addition, this work has considered Solar Energetic Particle events, which allows for a better understanding of the spectral form in the comparison. The results for protons and alpha particles show very good agreement between HZETRN and Planetocosmics.",

            "abstract": "Resolving the future of the ice in the polar regions requires understanding of the changing ice from top to bottom from the center of the ice sheets to the margin where ice interacts with the polar oceans. The IcePod is an imaging system developed to study the ice sheets and polar oceans in a comprehensive fashion from an LC-130. The system has been developed for initial deployment on the New York National Guard’s ski-equipped LC-130s. The IcePod can resolve high resolution surface elevation with a scanning laser and visual cameras, the temperature of the surface with an infrared camera, the thickness and layering of the shallow snow and ice with a high frequency radar and the thickness of the ice sheet with an ice penetrating radar. The IcePod can be moved between aircraft in less than four hours and can be operated on aircraft on routine cargo missions to skiways.\nHere we present IcePod ice-ocean imaging from the top to the bottom of several major outlet glaciers in western Greenland. The data, acquired in July 2014, demonstrates the broad capabilities of the IcePod instrumentation suite. The IcePod resolved the structure of the ice sheet from the accumulation zone to the calving front of Eqip Glacier and 4 adjacent outlet glacier systems. High resolution mapping of the calving front and the upwelling meltwater plumes provides new insights into the structure and dynamics of the turbulent mixing at the ice-ocean interface. Mapping of the ice sheet margin provides insights into the connections between the surface meltwater and the fate of the subglacial water at the ice sheet base. The Greenland data includes airport passes in every flight for calibration of both the lidar and camera systems.\nAn expanded IcePod instrumentation suite will include a gravity meter and a magnetometer. The gravity meter can be used to determine the bathymetry beneath ice shelves. Together the gravimeter and the magnetometer can be used to constrain the regional tectonic frameworks.\nIn November 2014, the IcePod system will be operated in Antarctica targeting the formation of polynyas, the Ross Ice Shelf structure and stability and the distribution of subglacial water in East Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region is both highly variable and rapidly changing. In the Palmer Station region, the ice season duration has decreased by 92 days since 1978. The sea-ice changes affect ocean stratification and freshwater balance; and in turn impact every component of the polar marine ecosystem. Long-term observations from the WAP shelf region show a pattern of chlorophyll (Chl) variability with three to five years of negative Chl anomalies interrupted by one or two years of positive anomalies. Observations and results from an inverse food-web model show that these low and high Chl regimes differed significantly from each other, with high primary productivity and net community production (NCP) associated with the high Chl years and vice-versa. Gross primary production averaged 40 mmolC m-2 d-1 in the low Chl years and 100 mmolC m-2 d-1 in the high Chl years, with 30-40% going to NCP across regimes. Only the food web in the southern region in high Chl years was dominated by large phytoplankton and krill, whereas in in all other cases, foodwebs were dominated by small phytoplankton and microzooplankton. These contrasts were strongest between the northern, low Chl years and southern, high Chl years, consistent with earlier north to south observations of sea ice and ecosystem change along the WAP. The relative importance of major bulk carbon flows did not differ substantially between high and low Chl years. Both the northern/low Chl and southern/high Chl regimes had roughly equal proportions of NCP, although its composition reflected shifts in dominance by large versus small plankton. These results suggest that food webs dominated by smaller phytoplankton and grazers have pathways that funnel production into NCP, and likely, export.",

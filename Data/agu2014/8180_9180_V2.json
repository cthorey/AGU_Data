            "abstract": "Site preference (SP), the difference in δ15N between the central (α) and outer (β) N atoms in N2O, has emerged as a conservative tracer of microbial N2O production. The key advantages of SP relative to bulk isotopes are (1) that it is independent of the isotope composition of the substrates of nitrification and denitrification and (2) has not been shown to exhibit fractionation during production. In pure microbial culture distinct SP values for N2O production from bacterial denitrification, including nitrifier-denitrification (-10 to 0 ‰), relative to hydroxylamine oxidation and fungal denitrification (33-37 ‰) provide a promising basis to resolve production pathways. In this study, we determined the δ15N, δ18O, δ15Nα, and δ15Nβ of N2O generated by purified fungal (P450nor) and bacterial nitric oxide reductases. The isotope values were used to calculate SP values, enrichment factors (e), and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Both O and Nα displayed normal isotope effects during enzymatic NO reduction by the P450nor with e values of -25.7‰ (KIE = 1.0264) and -12.6‰ (KIE = 1.0127), respectively. However, bulk nitrogen (average δ15N of Nα and Nβ) and Nβ exhibited inverse isotope effects with e values of 14.0‰ (KIE = 0.9862) and 36.1‰ (KIE = 0.9651), respectively. The observed inverse isotope effect in δ15Nβ is consistent with reversible binding of the first NO in the P450nor reaction mechanism. Experiments with bacterial nitric oxide reductase are ongoing, however, preliminary data indicates a inverse isotope effect in the α and β positions and a normal isotope effect in δ18O. In contrast to the constant SP observed during N2O production observed in microbial cultures, the SP measured for purified P450nor was not constant, increasing from ~15‰ to ~29‰ during the course of the reaction. Our results clearly indicate that fractionation of SP during N2O production by P450nor is not zero, and that SP values higher and lower than the proposed end member value of 37‰ can be expected during fungal denitrification. The observation in pure microbial culture of constant SP can only be reconciled if the rate of nitrite and NO reduction are the same (thereby maintaining a steady NO concentration in the cell), and, further, that the magnitude of the P450nor NO binding constant (Kd) maintains the extent of the reaction (1-f) at 65%.",

            "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REE’s) are crucial in the manufacture of smartphones and many other high tech devices. Increasing global demand and relatively narrow geographic sourcing have promoted interest in understanding REE deposit genesis and distribution. Highly weathered, clay-hosted, ion-exchange type deposits in southern China are the source of much of the world’s production of the more valuable heavy REEs. Such deposits form as REE-bearing minerals weather and REEs released to solution in ionic form are retained by negatively charged exchange sites on clay minerals. We are investigating the potential for ion-exchange REE deposits in the Piedmont of the southeastern United States, where slow erosion rates have preserved thick (up to 20 m) regolith, as required for such deposits. The Liberty Hill pluton outcrops as coarse-grained biotite-amphibole granite and quartz monzonite over nearly 400 km2 in South Carolina, and has an age of 305 Ma (new SHRIMP ion microprobe zircon age). In weathered profiles over the pluton, ion-exchangeable REE content ranges from 8 to 580 ppm and accounts for 2 to 80% of bulk REE content. Elemental and heavy mineral distributions suggest the wide ranging differences in leachability may be attributable to the amount and distribution of resistant REE-bearing phases (e.g., monazite) relative to more easily weathered phases (e.g., allanite) in the parent granite. The REEs show little mobility within the regolith, indicating the effectiveness of the ion-exchange retention mechanism. In contrast, vertical redistribution of colloidal material shows maximum accumulations at ~1 m depth, as traced by the newly developed dual-phase (colloids vs. solution) mass balance model. The contrast suggests redistributed colloidal material has minimal influence on REE mobilization or retention. Conditions and processes necessary for ion-exchange REE deposit development exist in the Piedmont, but their presence will depend upon favorable parent rock mineralogy.",

In order to make cost effective and efficient decisions, monitoring network in Turkey has been expanding. However, due to time and budget constraints, desired number of monitoring campaigns can not be carried. Hence, in this study, independent parameters that can be measured easily and quickly are used to estimate water quality parameters in Lake Mogan and Eymir using linear regression. Nonpoint sources are one of the major pollutant components in Eymir and Mogan lakes. In this paper, a correlation between easily measurable parameters, DO, temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, precipitation and dependent variables, TN, TP, COD, Chl-a, TSS, Total Coliform is investigated. Simple regression analysis is performed for each season in Eymir and Mogan lakes by using SPSS Statistical program using the water quality data collected between 2006-2012. Regression analysis demonstrated significant linear relationship between measured and simulated concentrations for TN (R2=0.86), TP (R2=0.85), TSS (R2=0.91), Chl-a (R2=0.94), COD (R2=0.99), T. Coliform (R2=0.97) which are the best results in each season for Eymir and Mogan Lakes. The overall results of this study shows that by using easily measurable parameters even in ungauged situation the water quality of lakes can be predicted. Moreover, the outputs obtained from the regression equations can be used as an input for water quality models such as phosphorus budget model which is used to calculate the required reduction in the external phosphorus load to Lake Mogan to meet the water quality standards.",

            "abstract": "We report geodetic evidence for decadal-scale decoupling of the Japan Trench prior to the 2011 M9 Tohoku earthquake, with supporting evidence from repeating earthquakes. We build on the results of Mavrommatis et al. (2014, GRL), where we investigated GPS time series for 15 years before the M9 event, correcting for the copious postseismic deformation following numerous M ~ 6.5+ earthquakes between 2003 and 2011. We modeled interseismic deformation as linear trends plus constant accelerations and corrected for coseismic and postseismic effects of M 6.3+ quakes during the period 1996 to 2011. We find spatially coherent and statistically significant accelerations throughout northern Honshu.\nWhile the accelerations in northern Tohoku can be explained by decaying postseismic deformation following the 1994 M7.7 Sanriku quake, the accelerations in south-central Tohoku cannot be explained simply by postseismic effects. Time series in south-central Tohoku reveal an approximately continuous transient spanning the period 1996 to 2011, without any obvious onset. The transient is consistent with a decrease in the average shear strain rate by ~1/3 in 15 years, and can be explained by increasing average slip rate and/or updip migration of the locked-to-creeping transition depth. MCMC inversions of instantaneous velocities in 1996 and 2011 imply a shallowing of the transition depth by 13.5 +/- 9.5 km and an increase in the average slip rate in the depth range from 22 km to the transition depth by 48.5 +/- 10.5 mm/yr.\nTo test these predictions and to provide additional constraints on the changes in slip rate, we use independent observations of repeating earthquakes during the same period. We find that several sequences of repeaters offshore south-central Tohoku exhibit decreasing recurrence intervals, possibly implying increasing slip rate, while sequences offshore Sanriku exhibit increasing recurrence intervals, consistent with decaying afterslip from the 1994 M7.7 Sanriku event. This along-strike dichotomy is consistent with an inversion of the GPS accelerations and suggests that some change in slip rate in depths shallower than ~60 km is required by the data. Further analysis of the repeating earthquakes will provide additional constraints to discriminate between such models.",

            "abstract": "Variability observed in near-surface soil moisture is a function of spatial and temporal scale and an understanding of the same is required in numerous environmental and hydrological applications. Past literature has focused largely on the Darcy support scale of measurement for generating knowledge about soil moisture variability and the factors causing it. With the advent of a remote sensing era, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of soil moisture variability and the factors creating it at the remote sensing footprint scale. This understanding will facilitate knowledge transfer between scales which remains an area of active research. In this study, we have presented the hierarchy of controls that physical factors namely, soil, vegetation and topography exert on soil moisture distributions from airborne remote sensor footprint scale (~800 m) to a satellite footprint scale (12800 m) across 3 hydro-climates- humid (Iowa), sub-humid (Oklahoma) and semi-arid (Arizona). We evaluated the effect of physical factors on soil moisture variability at coarse spatial support scales but fine (daily) temporal spacing scales which are typical of remotely sensed soil moisture data. The hierarchy or ranking scheme defined in the study is a function of the areal extent of controls of the different physical factors and the magnitude of their effect in creating spatial variability of soil moisture. We found that even though the areal influence of soil on soil moisture variability remained significant at all scales, it decreased as we went from airborne scale to coarser scales whereas the influence of topography and vegetation increased for all three hydro-climates. The magnitude of the effect of these factors, however, was dependent on antecedent soil moisture conditions and hydro-climate.",

The seasonal, spatial and water mass affinities of foraminifera species have implications for the interpretation of fossil assemblages and the interpretation of shell geochemistry. Two years (2012-2014) of shallow (<200 m) plankton tows, taken along the continental shelf inside the California Current system, offer new insights into the spatial and seasonal dynamics of planktic foraminifera in an upwelling regime. Tows along with intensive hydrologic monitoring by CTD casts and discrete bottle sampling (temperature, salinity, oxygen, thermocline depth, carbonate saturation state) have spanned two complete seasonal upwelling-relaxation cycles. We present the results from these tows as well as preliminary models linking environmental drivers and foraminifera assemblages in this highly dynamic environment. Species abundances appear to be highly seasonal, in keeping with water column structure, with a seasonal upwelling to relaxation trade off between the non-spinose foraminifers Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and Neogloboquadrina incompta.

In this collaboration, we applied a data sonification approach to express NASA’s global temperature record as a musical composition for the cello. The resulting piece, which we titled ‘A Song of Our Warming Planet’, transformed 133 years of annual global temperature anomalies into a haunting, atonal melody that stretched across almost all of the instrument’s range. Since its release in June 2013, the song has been featured by several national and international media outlets, including the New York Times, the Weather Channel, and National Public Radio, and its accompanying video has received more than 140,000 views from nearly every corner of the world. We are currently preparing a new composition for string quartet that will add a geographic dimension to describe both the pace and place of global warming. We believe the success of our initial sonification project is testament to the power of music to reach audiences who respond less enthusiastically to traditional methods used to communicate climate science. We also imagine this approach could be applied more broadly to allow students to create novel, visceral, and memorable encounters with other aspects of the geophysical sciences.",

Achieving this, and other objectives in NGSS, will require changes in the educational system for both students and teachers. Teachers need access to high quality instructional materials and continuous professional learning opportunities starting in pre-service education. Students need highly engaging and authentic learning experiences focused on content that is strategically interwoven with science practices.\nPre-service and early career teachers, even at the secondary level, often have relatively weak understandings of the complex Earth systems science required for understanding climate change and hold alternative ideas and naïve beliefs about the nature of science. These naïve understandings cause difficulties in portraying and teaching science, especially considering what is being called for in NGSS. The ACLIPSE program focuses on middle school pre-service science teachers and education faculty because: (1) the concepts that underlie climate change align well with the disciplinary core ideas and practices in NGSS for middle grades; and (2) middle school is a critical time for capturing students interest in science as student engagement by eighth grade is the most effective predictor of student pursuit of science in high school and college. Capturing student attention at this age is critical for recruitment to STEM careers and lifelong climate literacy.\nTHE ACLIPSE program uses cutting edge research and technology in ocean observing systems to provide educators with new tools to engage students that will lead to deeper understanding of the interactions between the ocean and climate systems. Establishing authentic, meaningful connections between indigenous and place-based, and technological climate observations will help generate a more holistic perspective on climate change and demonstrate that observing systems can enhance understanding. ACLIPSE materials strive to translate research about climate change effectively into understandable narratives of real world phenomena using ocean data, creating meaningful pathways into ocean-climate science for students in ALL communities.",

            "abstract": "The Snowball Earth hypothesis has inspired several variants which may help to explain some of the great mysteries of the Neoproterozoic glaciations. One of these, the \"Mudball Earth\", proposes that as the Earth remained completely frozen for millions of years, a layer of dust accumulated on the ice surface. This dust layer would darken the planet, making it easier for the Earth to escape from the highly stable snowball climate state. This hypothesis is testable: after the ice melted at the end of a glacial era, this dust would sink to the bottom of the ocean, possibly forming a distinct clay, mud, or silt layer on the top of the glacial till deposits: this \"clay drape\" would then be covered by the cap carbonates that mark a return to warm climate. Sublimation and ice flow during the glacial episode should make this layer thicker at the equator and thinner or absent in the poles. Is this clay layer actually present in the rock record? Is it more prevalent at the paleoequator, as predicted? A clay drape has been noticed anecdotally, but no global survey has been done to date. We conducted a thorough literature review of all sites where Neoproterozoic glacial diamictites have been observed, identifying the type of rock that lies between the diamictite and the postglacial cap carbonate, when present, during both Sturtian and Marinoan glacial periods. Only a few publications identify a distinct clay/silt/mud layer that might represent weathered dust. These sites are not grouped by paleolatitude in any obvious way. With access only to published reports, we cannot determine whether such a layer is absent, went unreported, or was misinterpreted by us. With this work we hope to attract the attention of Neoproterozoic field geologists, inviting them to comment on the presence or absence of strata which could confirm or reject the \"Mudball\" hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "The DEEP propagating gravity WAVE program (DEEPWAVE) is a comprehensive, airborne and ground-based measurement and modeling program centered on New Zealand and focused on providing a new understanding of gravity wave dynamics and impacts from the troposphere through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). This program employed the NSF/NCAR GV (NGV) research aircraft from a base in New Zealand in a 6-week field measurement campaign in June-July 2014. During the field phase, the NGV was equipped with new lidar and airglow instruments, as well as dropwindsondes and a full suite of flight level instruments including the microwave temperature profiler (MTP), providing temperatures and vertical winds spanning altitudes from immediately above the NGV flight altitude (~13 km) to ~100 km. The region near New Zealand was chosen since all the relevant GW sources (e.g., mountains, cyclones, jet streams) occur strongly here, and upper-level winds in austral winter permit gravity waves to propagate to very high altitudes.\nThe COAMPS adjoint modeling system provided forecast sensitivity in real time during the six-week DEEPWAVE field phase. Five missions were conducted using the NGV to observe regions of high forecast sensitivity, as diagnosed using the COAMPS adjoint model. In this presentation, we provide a summary of the sensitivity characteristics and explore the implications for predictability of low-level winds crucial for gravity wave launching, as well as predictability of gravity wave characteristics in the stratosphere. In general, the sensitive regions were characterized by localized strong dynamics, often involving intense baroclinic systems with deep convection. The results of the adjoint modeling system suggest that gravity wave launching and the characteristics of the gravity waves can be linked to these sensitive regions near frontal zones within baroclinic systems. The predictability links between the tropospheric fronts, cyclones, jet regions, and gravity waves that vertically propagate upward through the stratosphere will be addressed further in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "The 1 April 2014 Iquique, Chile Mw 8.1 earthquake occurred at 23:46(UTC) along a mega-thrust fault off northernmost Chile, where the Nazca plate is subducting beneath the South America plate at a convergence rate of ~8 cm/year. Northernmost Chile has been quiescent for 136 years since the 1877 M 8.6 earthquake, resulting in a current “North Chile seismic gap” stretching for ~450 km length along the strike of the plate boundary. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS) catalog, the mainshock was preceded by intensive foreshock sequence lasting around 15 days. To obtain a precise record of the foreshock sequence before the 2014 Iquique, Chile Mw 8.1 earthquake, we applied a matched-filter technique to continuous seismograms recorded near the source region. We newly detected about 10 times the number of seismic events listed in the routinely constructed earthquake catalog, and identified multiple sequences of earthquake migrations at speeds of 2–10 km/day, both along-strike and down-dip on the fault plane, up-dip of the mainshock area. In addition, we found out repeating earthquakes from the newly detected events, likely indicating aseismic slip along the plate boundary fault during the foreshock sequence. These observations suggest the occurrence of multiple slow-slip events up-dip of the mainshock area. The final slow-slip event, which had the fastest migration speed, migrated toward the mainshock nucleation point. We interpret that several parts of the plate boundary fault perhaps experienced slow slip, causing stress loading on the prospective largest slip patch of the mainshock rupture (Kato and Obara, 2014).",

This heuristic is particularly relevant in the case of climate change, where perception of consensus is one of the main predictors of public support for climate action. A low public perception of consensus (around 60% compared to the actual 97% consensus) is a significant stumbling block to meaningful climate action, underscoring the importance of closing the “consensus gap”. However, some scientists question the efficacy or appropriateness of emphasizing consensus in climate communication. I'll summarize the social science research examining the importance and effectiveness of consensus messaging.

            "abstract": "It is 35 years since it was first demonstrated that interannual variations in seasonal Australian region tropical cyclone (TC) activity could be predicted using simple indices of the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO). That demonstration (Nicholls, 1979), which was surprising and unexpected at the time, relied on only 25 years of data (1950-1975), but its later confirmation eventually led to the introduction of operational seasonal tropical cyclone activity. It is worth examining how well the ENSO-TC relationship has performed, over the period since 1975. Changes in observational technology, and even how a tropical cyclone is defined, have affected the empirical relationships between ENSO and seasonal activity, and ways to overcome this in forecasting seasonal activity will be discussed. Such changes also complicate the investigation of long-term trends in cyclone activity. The early work linked cyclone activity to local sea surface temperature thereby leading to the expectation that global warming would result in an increase in cyclone activity. But studies in the 1990s (eg., Nicholls et al., 1998) suggested that such an increase in activity was not occurring, neither in the Australian region nor elsewhere. Trends in Australian tropical cyclone activity will be discussed, and the confounding influence of factors such as changes in observational technologies will be examined.\nNicholls, N. 1979.

            "abstract": "Many areas of the Arctic are undergoing rapid permafrost and ecosystem transitions resulting from a combination of industrial development and climate change as summer sea ice retreats and abundant Arctic natural resources become more accessible for extraction. The Bovanenkovo Gas Field (BGF) in Russia and the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield (PBO) in Alaska are among the oldest and most extensive industrial complexes in the Arctic, situated in areas with extensive ice-rich permafrost. Ongoing studies of cumulative effects in both regions are part of the Northern Eurasia Earth-Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI) and NASA’s Land-Cover Land-Use Change (LCLUC) research. Comparative analysis is focused on changes occurring due to different climate, permafrost, land-use, and disturbance regimes in the BGF and PBO and along bioclimate transects that contain both fields. Documentation of the changes in relationship to the different geoecological and social-economic conditions will help inform management approaches to minimize the effects of future activities. We compare the area of disturbance in the two fields and some of the key differences in the permafrost conditions. Detailed remote sensing and geoecological mapping in both areas reveal major differences in permafrost conditions that have implications for total ecological function. At BGF, highly erodible sands and the presence of massive tabular ground ice near the surface contributes to landslides and thermo-denudation of slopes. At PBO, ice-wedge degradation is the most noticeable change, where thermokarst is expanding rapidly along ice-wedges adjacent to roads and in areas away from roads. Between 1990 and 2001, coincident with strong atmospheric warming during the 1990s, natural thermokarst resulted in conversion of low-centered ice-wedge polygons to high-centered polygons, more active lakeshore erosion and increased landscape and habitat heterogeneity. These geoecololgical changes have local and regional consequences to wildlife habitat, land-use, and infrastructure. A conceptual model describes how infrastructure-related factors, including road dust and roadside flooding, are contributing to more extensive thermokarst in areas adjacent to roads and gravel pads in the PBO.",

            "abstract": "Slopes on steady-state soil-mantled hillslopes tend to increase downslope in a way that balances local transport capacity with the sediment supplied from progressively larger source areas. Most predictions for the transport of soil depend purely on topographic slope and constants. Thus, soil mantled topography should evolve toward smooth forms in which soils act to buffer these forms from the underlying geologic structure. However, in the Gabilan Mesa, CA, oscillations in the slope of soil-mantled hillslopes mirror oscillations in the underlying stratigraphy. Using field measurements of stratigraphy and soil depths, topographic analysis, and numerical modeling, we demonstrate that variations in rock type can impact the form of soil-mantled hillslopes. Specifically, variations in the properties of underlying rocks may yield different soil thicknesses. Balancing transport rates across these variations in thickness requires slopes to change when soil transport depends on both soil thickness and slope. A compilation of published data on the variation in activity with depth of various transport processes provides the basis for a geomorphic transport law (GTL) that generalizes the depth dependence of various transport processes. While this GTL is explicitly depth dependent, it is also capable of describing situations in which hillslope transport is relatively insensitive to variations in thickness and therefore essentially equivalent to existing formulations. We use dimensional analysis and numerical modeling to demonstrate the conditions under which transport on soil mantled slopes, and consequently topographic forms, may be sensitive to variations in soil thickness and therefore lithology.",

The total number of reported cholera cases for the period of April to July, 2014 were 5,141 including 114 deaths. With the limited efficacy of cholera vaccines, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to predict cholera occurrence and thereafter devise intervention strategies for mitigating impacts of the disease. Hydroclimatic processes, primarily precipitation and air temperature are related to epidemic and episodic outbreak of cholera. However, due to coarse resolution of both datasets, it is not possible to precisely locate the geographical location of disease. Here, using Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MODIS sensors, we have developed an algorithm to identify regions susceptible for cholera. Conditions for occurrence of cholera were detectable at least one month in advance in South Sudan and were statistically sensitive to hydroclimatic anomalies of land surface and air temperature, and precipitation. Our results indicate significant spatial and temporal averaging required to infer usable information from LST over South Sudan. Preliminary results that geographically location of cholera outbreak was identifiable within 1km resolution of the LST data.",

Thus, a better understanding of two immiscible brine-CO2 mobility and its saturation, including invading patterns in deep saline aquifers as CO2 storage sites is required. Lenormand (1990) explored the invading patterns of two immiscible fluids in porous media with a transition region and three dominant regions: capillary fingering, viscous fingering, and stable displacement. These are determined by two main aspect ratios Nm and Nc through experimental studies using micromodel. Micromodel provides the opportunity to discover unrecognized processes, and test existing theories and assumptions in fluid flow through porous media. In this study, the micromodel was used to explore the effects of the scCO2 injecting velocity and ionic strength on invading patterns in geological CO2 sequestration. When scCO2 was injected into the micromodel that has already saturated with brine, the brine in the micromodel was displaced by injected scCO2. Continuous scCO2 injection into the micromodel leaded the scCO2 to pass through the micromodel. And the scCO2-brine displacement distribution in the micromodel remained constant during additional 100 PV scCO2 injection after injecting scCO2 passed through micromodel. When scCO2 passed through the porous media, the scCO2-brine displacement distribution represented the maximum displacement ratio. Results showed that scCO2-brine displacement ratios increased with: elevated pressures in the range of 3MPa~8MPa, decreased ionic strength from 5M to 1M NaCl, and increased scCO2 injecting velocity up to 40 μL/min. Also, Nm and Nc obtained in this study are located in transition region of the invading patterns suggested by Lenormand (1990).",

We present here the IEDA Thesaurus, a system, which combines existing separate controlled vocabularies from the different systems under the IEDA schema into a single master controlled vocabulary, also introducing some new top facets for future long-term use. The IEDA thesaurus contains structured terminology for petrology, geochemistry, sedimentology, oceanography, geochronology, and volcanology, and other general metadata fields. 18 top facets (also called ‘top categories’) are defined, including equipment, geographic gazetteer, geologic ages, geologic units, materials, etc. The terms of the thesaurus are cross validated with others popular geoscience vocabularies such as GeoRef Thesaurus, U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System, Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), and Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) ontologies. The thesaurus is organized along with the ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies, and is published using Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) format.

We use energetic (9-210 keV) ion composition measurements made by the Geotail satellite at r = 10~31 RE. The results are summarized as follows: (1) whereas the O+-to-H+ ratio decreases with earthward flow velocity, it increases with tailward flow velocity with Vx dependence steeper for perpendicular flows than for parallel flows; (2) for fast earthward flows, the energy density of each ion species increases without any clear preference for heavy ions; (3) for fast tailward flows the ion energy density increases initially, then it decreases to below pre-flow levels except for O+; (4) the O+-to-H+ ratio does not increase through local dipolarization irrespective of dipolarization amplitude, background BZ, X distance, and VX; (5) in general, the H+ and He++ ions behave similarly. Result (1) can be attributed to radial transport along with the earthward increase of the background O+-to-H+ ratio. Results (2) and (4) indicate that ion energization associated with local dipolarization is not mass-dependent possibly because in the energy range of our interest the ions are not magnetized irrespective of species. In the tailward outflow region of reconnection, where the plasma sheet becomes thinner, the H+ ions escape along the field line more easily than the O+ ions, which possibly explains result (3). Result (5) suggests that the solar wind is the primary source of the high-energy H+ ions.",

            "abstract": "The time is critical for Tribal, Indigenous and Underrepresented K-12/university students and communities to accept the duty to provide representation in Earth System Sciences/Geosciences fields of study and professions. Tribal nations in the U.S have a unique legal status rooted in a complex relationship between the U.S. federal government, individual state/local governments and Tribal authorities. Although geosciences are often at the center of these relationships, especially as they pertain to the development of natural resources, tribal economics, and environmental stewardship, Tribal/Indigenous people remain severely underrepresented in advanced geoscience education.\nOur students and communities have responded to the invitation. To represent and most important develop and lead research initiatives. Leadership is a central focus of the invitation to participate, as Tribal people have immense responsibility for significant landscapes across North American Continent, critical natural resources and millennia of unpretentious natural evolution with the localized native geologies, species and environmental systems.\nINRSEP and Pacific Northwest Tribal Nations found sustaining relationships with the Geoscience Alliance, MS PHD's, Woods Hole PEP, Native American Pacific Islander Research Experience (NAPIRE) and LSAMP programs, in addition to state/federal agencies, has advanced culturally-relevant STEM research. Research foundationally grounded on traditional ecological knowledge, individual and Tribal self-determination. A key component is student research experiences within their ancestral homelands and traversing to REU’s in multiple national and international Tribal/Indigenous ancestral territories.\nThe relationships also serve an immense capacity in tracking student achievement, promoting best practices in research development and assessing outcomes. The model has significantly improved the success of students completing STEM graduate programs.\nThe presentation will highlight lessons learned on how to 1) Ensure a diverse cohort/community of student, professionals and researchers; 2) Evolve intergenerational mentoring processes/outcomes; 3) Innovate research and programs; and 4) Advance the broader impact of geosciences research and outcomes.",

            "abstract": "The growing field of metaproteomics links microbial communities to their expressed functions by using mass spectrometry methods to characterize community proteins. Comparison of mass spectrometry protein search algorithms and their biases is crucial for maximizing the quality and amount of protein identifications in mass spectral data. Available algorithms employ different approaches when mapping mass spectra to peptides against a database. We compared mass spectra from four microbial proteomes derived from high-organic content soils searched with two search algorithms: 1) Sequest HT as packaged within Proteome Discoverer (v.1.4) and 2) X!Tandem as packaged in TransProteomicPipeline (v.4.7.1). Searches used matched metagenomes, and results were filtered to allow identification of high probability proteins. There was little overlap in proteins identified by both algorithms, on average just ~24% of the total. However, when adjusted for spectral abundance, the overlap improved to ~70%. Proteome Discoverer generally outperformed X!Tandem, identifying an average of 12.5% more proteins than X!Tandem, with X!Tandem identifying more proteins only in the first two proteomes. For spectrally-adjusted results, the algorithms were similar, with X!Tandem marginally outperforming Proteome Discoverer by an average of ~4%. We then assessed differences in heat shock proteins (HSP) identification by the two algorithms by BLASTing identified proteins against the Heat Shock Protein Information Resource, because HSP hits typically account for the majority signal in proteomes, due to extraction protocols. Total HSP identifications for each of the 4 proteomes were approximately ~15%, ~11%, ~17%, and ~19%, with ~14% for total HSPs with redundancies removed. Of the ~15% average of proteins from the 4 proteomes identified as HSPs, ~10% of proteins and spectra were identified by both algorithms. On average, Proteome Discoverer identified ~9% more HSPs than X!Tandem.",

            "abstract": "The latest generation of earth system models simulate leaf area index, as well as provide projections of leaf area index (LAI) in the future. Here we use satellite measurements of LAI to look at the ability of the current generation of models to simulate the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of LAI. In addition, we look at observed temperature and precipitation relationships with interannual variability in LAI, and consider whether the models are able to correctly simulate these relationships. We use this analysis to also examine how useful particular metrics are for inter-model comparisons and model skill evaluation. We propose that good metrics for evaluating coupled earth system models are those that are relatively insensitive to the meteorology used to force them. In addition, it is valuable to have skill metrics that correlate with future projections, which would allow us to eliminate some future projections as less likely. Depending on the region of interest (tropics, mid-latitudes or high latitudes), we show that different metrics are of the most use. For future projections over the whole globe and in the tropics the most important metrics are related to current LAI correlations with time, as well as the magnitude of the mean LAI. However, several metrics are shown to have significant correlations with future projections, inhibiting our ability to use the correlation of skill metrics with future projections to improve future projections.",

            "abstract": "Recent work shows that, in contrast to global numerical weather prediction models, space-borne scatterometers are able to resolve the increased wind variability near convection areas. This unique capability is essential for climate applications, since wind variability directly impacts air-sea fluxes and, as such, air-sea interaction. Although scatterometer-derived wind quality is known to be degraded by rain contamination effects (notably for Ku-band systems), recent results show that for C-band scatterometers, such as the Advanced Scatterometers (ASCAT-A and ASCAT-B) onboard the Metop satellite series, the wind quality degradation under rain conditions is mainly due to the increased sub-cell wind variability. Moreover, ASCAT winds are of comparable quality to buoy winds while they provide a substantially larger coverage. Since convective systems rapidly evolve in time, ASCAT A and B acquisitions (overlapping in the tropics with only 50 minutes difference) provide a unique opportunity to carry out in-depth analyses of the dynamics associated to rain events.\nIn this study, Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) rain rate time series (every 15 minutes) around the Metop-A and B satellite overpasses are used to evaluate both the presence of rain and the maturity stage of the convective systems. Also, several wind-variability sensitive parameters derived from ASCAT data, such as the inversion residual, the measurement noise (Kp) and the singularity exponents (an estimation of the wind decorrelation between an observation cell and its neighboring cells), are used to assess both the quality of the derived winds and the potential presence of gust fronts. Moreover, divergence and curl fields are derived from ASCAT A and B winds to provide insight on the wind convergence/divergence and vorticity processes associated with convection and related downdrafts/downbursts.\nAlthough much affected by rain, a similar analysis will also be carried out for Ku-band scatterometers, such as Oceansat-2 and the upcoming Rapidscat (if calibrated data are available in time). Intercomparison of C-band and Ku-band winds under rain conditions will certainly provide new insights on how to improve scatterometer processing to better resolve rain-induced dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a globally distributed contaminant that threatens ecosystem health across aquatic environments. The complexity of the Hg cycle and its primary drivers, coupled with dynamic food web processes that govern biomagnification, result in marked spatial variability in Hg bioaccumulation across aquatic ecosystems. However, it is unclear if patterns of bioaccumulation are consistent in magnitude and direction across ecosystem types. We synthesized data from several studies spanning more than 200 individual sites, comprising four distinct ecosystem classifications (estuaries, sub-alpine lakes, rivers, and managed wetlands). Within each ecosystem, we compared fish Hg concentrations among replicated sub-habitats and also evaluated the influence of land use, landscape composition, and biogeochemical drivers on fish Hg concentrations. We found substantial variability in fish Hg concentrations among adjacent sub-habitats within ecosystems. In estuarine environments, fish Hg concentrations were 7.4x higher in seasonal-saline wetlands than adjacent tidal wetland habitats. In riverine alcoves, preliminary data suggest that fish Hg concentrations were 1.5x higher than in fishes from paired mainstem river habitat. Among managed wetland habitats, fish Hg concentrations in rice fields were 2x higher than those in managed seasonal wetlands that were subjected to identical wetting and drying patterns. Across ecosystems, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters were consistently correlated with fish Hg concentrations, highlighting its importance in Hg methylation and transport processes. Yet, the strength and direction of the relationships varied among habitat types. For example, fish Hg concentrations were positively correlated with DOC concentrations in riverine environments, whereas we found a negative correlation in alpine lakes. Instead, the most important determinant of fish Hg concentrations in alpine lakes was conifer tree density within a lake’s catchment, resulting in a 4x increase in fish Hg concentration in lakes with the lowest to the highest catchment conifer tree density. Together, this integrated ecosystem analysis highlights the importance of understanding small-scale variation in bioaccumulation processes in order to better predict Hg risk.",

            "abstract": "To comprehensively understand the impact of atmospheric CO2 on air temperature, it is necessary to discuss about climate change by embracing attention to internal variability. However, the existing studies relevant to future prediction basically having century-scale analyses due to computational load problem, we remained in discussion about the transient change of earth system. This study demonstrated a comprehensive effect of CO2 (including both external and internal variability), by a millennial-scale global warming prediction with the simplified-type earth system model. As a result, during initial 1000 years CO2 emission had a positive influence in temperature in long-term, and in atmospheric CO2 in short-term. The difference of response time was caused by latent heat (the delay of oceanic response to CO2 emission). In the quasi-steady state, higher cumulated CO2 emission encourages more independence of relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2. It revealed that there might be a definite limitation to effectiveness for global warming caused by the CO2 emission in millennial scale. As future work of the global warming prediction, by collaborating with paleoclimatic studies, we need to figure out new mechanism leading to tipping point of earth system, especially an undescribed feedback system that provokes an irreversible change, while confirming a consistency of the model study with paleoenvironmental studies (e.g., paleoclimatic indicator, model, record) as clue for comprehending the high-priority process.",

            "abstract": "Chemical fractionation of slab-derived supercritical fluids can play an important role in elemental transfer from subducting slab to the mantle wedge and arc magmatism [1]. Recent findings of saline fluids from sub-arc mantle peridotite indicate that aqueous fluids in mantle wedge can contain 3.7 wt% NaCl in Ichinomageta, Northeast Japan arc [2] to 5.1 wt% NaCl in Pinatubo, Luzon arc [3]. It is, therefore, important to determine the effect of Cl on the trace element partitioning between aqueous fluids and melts.\nSynchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis is conducted to know Rb, Sr, and Pb partitioning between aqueous fluids and melts [4]. There is a positive correlation between partition coefficients and pressure, as well as salinity. Two slab-derived components, melt and fluid components, are suggested to explain trace element characteristics of arc-basalts in the Mariana arc [5]. The fluid component is characterized by enrichment of alkali and alkali earth elements. Such features can be explained if the fluid component is a saline fluid, because alkali earth elements and Pb are much less mobile with Cl-free fluids than Cl-rich fluids [4]. We suggest that slab-derived components have compositional features consistent with a saline fluid and a melt, which can be formed through a separation of a slab-derived supercritical fluid [1]. Slab derived supercritical fluids contain Cl, and aqueous fluids inherit much of the Cl and some of the large-ion lithophile elements.\n[1] Kawamoto et al. 2012, Separation of supercritical slab-fluids to form aqueous fluid and melt components in subduction zone magmatism.

Whilst a broad correlation between geographical location and driving mechanisms has been long recognized (i.e. amount effect is pervasive in tropical areas), further tests are required to determine the effect that different sources of moisture might impose on the isotopic composition of precipitation, particularly in areas where contributions from different ocean-basins might be significant, such as south Mexico.\nHere, we present the δ18O and δ2H composition of summer rainfall collected throughout south, central and western Mexico, particularly from Veracruz, Puebla, Guerrero, Morelos, Mexico City, Jalisco, Michoacán and Querétaro states. The geographical and temporal extent of our sampling (2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011) results in a large dataset comprising more than 600 samples and represents the base data to understand the atmospheric mechanisms modulating the isotopic composition of rainfall in Mexico. Our data span a range of 30‰ in δ18O, from high values nearest the Gulf of Mexico coast and during weak rainfall events, to lowest values in high-altitude central Mexico and during heavy rainfall events associated with tropical cyclones. Values on the Pacific Coast are intermediate, and likely reflect a contribution of both Gulf of Mexico and Pacific sources. Our data define a meteoric water line of δ2H = 7.92 × δ18O + 9.48, which indicate that most precipitation values formed close to isotopic equilibrium with water vapor. The two primary physiographic variables controlling δ18O values are distance from the Gulf of Mexico and altitude, which together explain about 70% of the variation in spatial δ18O values.",

            "abstract": "Detailed descriptions of the subsurface heterogeneities in coarse fluvial aquifer gravel often lack in concepts to distinguish between the essence and the noise of a permeability structure and the ability to extrapolate site specific hydraulic information at the tens to several hundred meters scale. At this scale the heterogeneity strongly influences the anisotropies of the flow field and the mixing processes in groundwater. However, in many hydrogeological models the complexity of natural systems is oversimplified. Understanding the link between the dynamics of the surface processes of braided-river systems and the resulting subsurface sedimentary structures is the key to characterizing the complexity of horizontal and vertical mixing processes in groundwater.\nFrom the different depositional elements of coarse braided-river systems, the largest permeability contrasts can be observed in the scour-fills. Other elements (e.g. different types of gravel sheets) show much smaller variabilities and could be considered as a kind of matrix. Field experiments on the river Tagliamento (Northeast Italy) based on morphological observation and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys, as well as outcrop analyses of gravel pit exposures (Switzerland) allowed us to define the shape, sizes, spatial distribution and preservation potential of scour-fills. In vertical sections (e.g. 2D GPR data, vertical outcrop), the spatial density of remnant erosional bounding surfaces of scours is an indicator for the dynamics of the braided-river system (lateral mobility of the active floodplain, rate of sediment net deposition and spatial distribution of the confluence scours). In case of combined low aggradation rate and low lateral mobility the deposits may be dominated by a complex overprinting of scour-fills. The delineation of the erosional bounding surfaces, that are coherent over the survey area, is based on the identification of angular discontinuities of the reflectors. Fence diagrams and horizontal time-slices from GPR data are used to construct simplified 3D hydraulic properties distribution models and to derive anisotropy patterns. On the basis of this work, conceptual models could be designed and implemented into numerical models to simulate the flow field and mixing in heterogeneous braided-river deposits.",

            "abstract": "The impact of climate change on regional ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycling has two important aspects that require better elaboration to improve projections of these effects. The first is that ecosystems don't respond directly to climate, but indirectly via frequency and occurrence of weather systems, which are driven by climatic shifts in global circulation and radiative processes. The second is that many responses of ecosystems to these weather patterns and extremes are lagged in time. Here, we examine these aspects for northern Alpine grasslands. Long-term eddy covariance flux tower and phenology observations in Austria and Germany and biophysical models reveal a strong influence of winter air temperature, snowfall, and snowmelt frequency on winter grass mortality and spring grassland carbon uptake. Further, the mode of climate variability that drives winter air temperature and snow depth patterns is primarily the frequency of strong regional southerly Foehn flow that promotes warm, dry conditions in winter. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the interannual variance in Foehn frequency and southerly flow is driven by statistics and climatic trends of 500 hPa pressure patterns in Greenland, part of the Arctic Oscillation. However, a few years, including the unusually warm and dry winter of 2013-2014 appear to have secondary, possibly local thermotopographic circulation factors that promoted its weather conditions regionally, which also included primarily cool and wet conditions in northern Europe and the southern Alps. These findings demonstrate that the regional response of ecosystems to climate change is modulated by how large-scale circulation patterns influence local meteorology and topographic flows both during and outside the growing season and provides a framework for future assessment and climate model improvements of linkages of climate change, weather patterns, and ecosystem responses.",

            "abstract": "Interannual variability of precipitation can influence components of the hydrological budget, affecting them directly and indirectly through adjustments in vegetation structure and function. We investigate the effects of variability of annual precipitation on ecohydrological dynamics. Specifically, the Advanced WEather GENerator, AWE-GEN is used to simulate 200 years of hourly meteorological forcing obtained by imposing four types of precipitation annual process. The generated time series force a mechanistic ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Simulations are performed for four locations characterized by different vegetation cover and climate conditions. The results indicate that long-term transpiration (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes and vegetation productivity expressed as Gross and Above-ground Net Primary Production (GPP, ANPP) are essentially unaffected by the imposed climate fluctuations, showing a mild response only in the water-limited environment. This finding supports the hypothesis of interannual insensitivity of evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity to annual climatic fluctuations, which are mostly reflected in fluxes of deep leakage and runoff. The occurrence of short periods of favorable meteorological conditions randomly taking place within the year was found to be a better explanatory variable for interannual variability of ET and ANPP than average annual or growing season conditions. Sensitivity of ET and GPP/ANPP to changes in mean precipitation was found to be much larger than sensitivity to changes in annual precipitation variability. As local, single-site sensitivities are considerably smaller than the sensitivities observed across climatic and vegetation gradients, an important role of ecosystem re-organization in modifying ANPP and ET sensitivity in a changing climate is highlighted.",

Whereas the idea of using GPS for tsunami early warning is clear, its practical implementation still requires extensive studies and validation against real events. The northern Chile 1 Apr. 2014 M8.0 Pisagua earthquake and resulting tsunami was extensively recorded by large number of land- and ocean-based sensors including real-time GPS. Earthquakes of this magnitude range (M7.0-M8.0) are especially challenging for tsunami warning centre since, in contrast to the mega-earthquakes, they do not necessary trigger devastating tsunamis. GPS-fingeprints of such earthquakes may also approach the limit of real-time detect ability. Thus, earthquakes of such a magnitude range fall in \"a blurred zone\", a zone of higher uncertainty in sense of tsunami early warning.\nWe take the opportunity and consider the 2014 Pisagua event as a case study to explore possible sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in the GPS-based real-time tsunami forecasting. In particular, we test uncertainties related to derivation of real-time source model: (1) Uncertainty of co-seismic displacements retrieved by different real-time GPS-processing strategy: precise relative positioning and precise point positioning; by different software platform: RTKLIB, PANDA, EPOS-RT, Bernese (post) (2) Uncertainty of source inversion by different approaches: single Okada fault, distributed slip in homogeneous and layered half space. We consider individual uncertainties as well as their propagation to the final tsunami forecasting. As a result, “up streams” and “down streams” are combined together, in which case a “close loop” criteria is illustrated for evaluation of uncertainty of the GPS-based tsunami forecasting.",

Global measurements of various trace species were performed from the arctic to the early antarctic vortex in August to September 2012. Here, we focus on the northern hemispheric distribution of CO, N2O and ozone above 380 K. In this region we could for the first time identify mixing lines, which indicate mixing between stratospheric air masses of different origin. Introducing a new pair of correlation species (N2O-CO) we could identify air masses, which do not involve mixing directly at the tropopause. The use of CO-N2O correlations provides additional knowledge on the end members and therefore the reservoirs involved in the mixing processes within the stratosphere compared to the CO-O3-correlation. Trace gas distributions for the atmospheric region between the extratropical tropopause and potential temperatures up to Θ = 405 K indicate mixing of 'young' stratospheric air with aged processed air. Backward trajectories indicate that the “younger” stratospheric air masses originate in the Asian monsoon region and contribute to the chemical composition of air above Θ = 380 K, thereby circumventing the TTL region. Therefore we conclude that the monsoon significantly contributes to the flushing of the extratropical UTLS during summer and autumn.",

            "abstract": "There are numerous sources of uncertainty that impact policy decisions relating to climate change: There is scientific uncertainty, as for example encapsulated in estimates of climate sensitivity. There is policy uncertainty, which arises when mitigation efforts are erratic or are reversed (as recently happened in Australia). There is also technological uncertainty which affects the mitigation pathway. How can policy decisions be informed in light of these multiple sources of uncertainty? We propose an “ordinal” approach that relies on comparisons such as “greater than” or “lesser than” (known as ordinal), which can help sidestep disagreement about specific parameter estimates (e.g., climate sensitivity). To illustrate, recent analyses (Lewandowsky et al., 2014, Climatic Change) have shown that the magnitude of uncertainty about future temperature increases is directly linked with the magnitude of future risk: the greater the uncertainty, the greater the risk of mitigation failure (defined as exceeding a carbon budget for a predetermined threshold). Here we extend this approach to other sources of uncertainty, with a particular focus on “ambiguity” or “second-order” uncertainty, which arises when there is dissent among experts.",

The SCIAMACHY and GOSAT overlapping time series of atmospheric column-averaged mole fractions, i.e., XCO2 and XCH4, now cover more than 10 years. During the last years significant progress has been made in improving the quality of the XCO2 and XCH4 data products retrieved from SCIAMACHY and GOSAT and in extending the time series so that more and more applications can be addressed. In this presentation we present some recent results related to CO2 and CH4 sources and sinks. The SCIAMACHY products have been generated using retrieval algorithms developed at University of Bremen. For XCO2 we use an ensemble of data products generated using GOSAT retrieval algorithms developed in Japan (at NIES), in the US (at NASA/JPL and collaborating institutes) and at European institutions (University of Leicester, UK, and SRON, Netherlands, in collaboration with KIT, Germany). Focus will be on three applications: (i) An assessment of the strength of the European terrestrial carbon sink during 2003-2010 based on an ensemble of SCIAMACHY (2003-2010) and GOSAT (2010) XCO2 data products, (ii) an assessment of CO2 and NO2 anthropogenic emission and emission ratio trends using co-located SCIAMACHY XCO2 and NO2 observations over Europe, North America and East Asia, and (iii) an analysis of SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrievals during 2006-2011 over North America focusing on fugitive methane emissions from oil and gas production using tight geological formations (“fracking”). It will be shown that (i) the European terrestrial carbon sink appears to be stronger than expected, (ii) that recent Chinese CO2 and NO2 emissions are increasing but with a trend towards reduced NO2-to-CO2 emission ratios pointing to cleaner technology in terms of less NO2 emitted per unit of CO2 (or unit of energy) and (iii) that the SCIAMACHY satellite-derived methane observations over two fast-growing oil production regions in the United States suggest a significant underestimation in current bottom-up inventories.",

            "abstract": "The measurement of seismic anisotropy using the method of shear wave splitting (SWS) has potential as a stress monitoring tool at volcanoes and is increasingly being used by researchers. Even though anisotropy, caused by preferentially aligned microcracks, can be a valid proxy for determining the stress regime in the subsurface, there are many other reasons that SWS may be observed. Anisotropy in the crust may be due to aligned macroscopic fractures, layering, or aligned minerals. Apparent SWS may also be observed due to site effects and phase conversions near the surface. Temporal changes in SWS may be an artefact of migrating sources passing through a heterogeneous anisotropic field.\nAt Tungurahua Volcano in Ecuador, we have analysed SWS from local VT earthquakes from 2008 to 2012, spanning the onset of major eruptive activity in 2010. We have found significant site effects at several of the seismic stations, and corrections indicate how influential these effects can be. We explore both lateral and vertical variation in anisotropy, before targeting temporal variations associated with volcanic activity. Comparison with local geology and ground deformation allows us to identify regions where seismic anisotropy is controlled by local stress and is likely to change due to volcanic activity. Preliminary results suggest that apparent temporal changes in SWS measurements are due to sampling regions controlled by different mechanisms of anisotropy, demonstrating how important it is to identify the cause of anisotropy before seeking temporal variations caused by changing stress.",

This seasonal survey (April 2011 to May 2013) revealed a year-round strong terrigenous contribution to the plant derived particulate organic matter (POM) with significant algal inputs observed in March and attributed to phytoplanktonic blooms likely dominated by diatoms.\nSpecific sitosterol and cholesterol degradation products were quantified and used to estimate the part of biotic and abiotic degradation of POM within the river. Plant-derived organic matter appears to be mainly affected by photo-oxidation and autoxidation (free radical oxidation), while organic matter of human origin, evidenced by the presence of coprostanol, is clearly more prone to bacterial degradation. Despite the involvement of an intense autoxidation inducing homolytic cleavage of peroxy bonds, a significant proportion of hydroperoxides is still intact in higher plant debris. These compounds could play a role in the degradation of terrestrial material by inducing an intense autoxidation upon its arrival at sea.\nAlthough sitosterol has been commonly used as a tracer of the terrestrial origin of POM in rivers, we show here that is it also found in phytoplankton, which highlights the need to use different tracers to determine the origin of POM in rivers. As part of the set of tracers we use, we have identified betulin to be an interesting candidate, although limited to a number of angiosperms species. Not only can we trace betulin to an unequivocal terrestrial origin, we also identified its specific degradation products, allowing us to trace the degradation state of angiosperm particulate debris in rivers, as well as the type of degradation undergone.",

The object-based model mimics this behaviour: at each iteration truncated ellipsoids (scour-fill deposits) are distributed, as a marked point process, at the previous simulated floodplain surface and are followed on top by a layer with a specified thickness (gravel sheets) that define the next floodplain topography. The truncated ellipsoids have erosional and depositional properties. Compared with the scour-fills, the gravel sheets show much less variability and a much smaller hydraulic conductivities with only a vertical anisotropy. Accordingly, specific three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity tensors and porosity values are stochastically attributed to the truncated ellipsoids and the horizontal layers.\nThis object-based model is able to simulate a large range of the morphodynamics of braided-river systems (scenarios) that result in different sediment sorting processes and, in turn, in specific hydraulic heterogeneity and connectivity patterns of high permeable units.\nIn the context of surface water-groundwater interaction the model is used to assess the impact of some scenarios on the groundwater flow field as well as on solute transport. We evaluate the vertical mixing of the groundwater flows, the horizontal flow deviation caused by the anisotropy of the scour-fill deposits as well as the solute transport behaviour. We discuss the specific hydraulic responses in relation with the heterogeneity and connectivity variability.",

In order to understand how such flow varies below the Juan de Fuca plate and is affected by its subduction along the Cascadia forearc, stacked splitting results are determined for 90 offshore and 27 onshore broadband seismometers. These instruments were deployed as part of phases one and two of the Cascadia Initiative, which is an ongoing effort to understand tectonic processes in the Pacific Northwest. The onshore results conform to those of previous studies, suggesting a uniformly trench-perpendicular flow field and thus implying a thick layer of material entrained beneath the slab. The offshore results offer suggestions about how the orientation of asthenospheric flow evolves across the width of the Juan de Fuca plate, and are unique in that they document variation in anisotropy from the ridge to the trench. The results indicate ridge-perpendicular flow geometry close to the Juan de Fuca ridge, which appears to rotate towards the direction of absolute plate motion as one moves towards the trench. As suggested by the latest tomographic images the subducting Juan de Fuca plate is segmented, with ‘gaps’ between the segments. These gaps may act as channels for the flow of mantle material.",

These problems are not confined to the climate scientific community, but it is shared among several scientific fields, such as high-particle physics, linguistics, and seismology, among others.\nWithin the framework of the European EUDAT project, several emerging services are being developed and deployed operationally to enhance collaborative and federated infrastructures that can scale to very large data volumes, driven by scientific communities' needs and international collaborations notably with the Research Data Alliance (RDA) and through Working Groups involving EUDAT partners and international experts. One of these Working Groups is focusing on Workflows and their execution near the data storage in a federated infrastructure, and these workflows will also be using EUDAT services.\nEUDAT current and upcoming services will be presented, with a focus in how these services will be useful to the climate community ESGF infrastructure in a Big Data era, to perform data analyses that are not hampered by limitations simply because of too large data volumes given today's tools and infrastructures. A generic interface/protocol for abstraction of specific communities federated data environments, enabling cross-communities data sharing and collaboration, will also be presented.\nThis study was funded by the EU project EUDAT funded by the European Commission’s Seventh Framework Research Programme under the grant agreement 283304.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive mechanism to explain seismicity in stable intraplate regions remains enigmatic. Within eastern and central North America, for example, a number of moderate to large-sized earthquakes have occurred, with the New Madrid sequence of 1811 and 1812 being the most noteworthy. The much more recent M 5.8 Virginia earthquake is a fresh reminder that there is a source for strain accumulation within eastern North America. Although there is agreement that these intraplate earthquakes owe their activity to the reactivation of ancient faults created during previous tectonic events, there is no comprehensive model to explain how these faults get reactivated. Several hypotheses exist, including lithospheric sources, such as ridge push, coupling with mantle flow, or even strain release associated with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we explore whether tectonic effects, which consist of forces associated with topography and lithosphere structure (gravity potential energy differences – GPE), coupled with the effects of large scale mantle flow, are compatible as a source of stress for seismicity within eastern US. We compare the p-axes of all compiled earthquake mechanisms in this region to the SHmax directions of deviatoric stresses, modeled using a global finite element method. The method we employ couples gravitational potential energy derived stresses with stresses from a global density-driven mantle convection model that incorporates both radial and lateral viscosity variations. Additionally, we also investigate how lateral strength variations within the lithosphere of continental North America and adjacent regions affect these forces, and consequently the occurrence of earthquakes in this region.",

            "abstract": "The major difficulty in detecting the aerosol signal from visible and near-infrared remote sensing observations is to reach the proper separation of the components related to the atmosphere and the surface. This issue becomes especially challenging over bright targets such as deserts. A method is proposed to circumvent this issue by exploiting the directional and temporal dimensions of the satellite signal through the use of a semi-empirical kernel-driven model for the surface/atmosphere coupled system. As a result, simultaneous retrieval of surface albedo and aerosol properties is made possible. The proposed method proves to be capable of detecting and tracking the presence of anthropogenic aerosols, volcanic ash emissions and dust events over deserts.\nThe proposed method referred to as AERUS-GEO (Aerosol and surface albEdo Retrieval Using a directional Splitting method - application to GEO data) is applied to three spectral bands (0.6 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.6 mm) of MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) observations, which scan Europe, Africa, and the Eastern part of South America every 15 minutes. The AERUS-GEO AOD estimates compare favorably with measurements of several AERONET stations, MODIS-derived (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer), and MISR-derived (Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer) products within a 20% of accuracy. Also, results reveal the capability of AERUS-GEO to detect more aerosol events within a given time period compared to products derived from low Earth orbit satellites. This higher availability of AOD products thanks to AERUS-GEO may benefit the accurate monitoring of the aerosol radiative forcing. The AERUS-GEO algorithm was recently implemented by the ICARE Data Center (http://www.icare.univ-lille1.fr), which operationally disseminates a daily AOD product at 670 nm over the MSG disk since 2014.",

These datasets will be utilised to achieve the overall goal of an accurate parameterisation of cirrus optical properties in global climate modelling and Numerical Weather Prediction, through testing and facilitating improvement of cirrus scattering models and investigation of the sensitivity of the radiance to Particle Size Distribution, habit types and crystal complexity.\nPresented here is an overview of CIRCCREX, the relevant background and previous results. Findings from the first stage of the research campaign, which took place over Prestwick, UK in November 2013, are reported with an emphasis on performance of cirrus radiative and scattering models. High resolution far- and mid-infrared spectra recorded over cirrus scenes are presented and linked to micro- and macro-physical cirrus properties. Uncertainties and challenges in both observations and model simulations are discussed, along with improvements for the next stages of the campaign.",

The Heletz area is located in the Southern part of the Mediterranean Coastal Plain, about 7km from the sea shore. The target layer is composed of sandstone, has a thickness of ~20 meters and is located at a depth of ~1500 m.\nFlow-through laboratory experiments of CO2-rich brine were realized to evaluate the chemical processes occurring in the Heletz site. The Heletz sandstone rock is poorly consolidated and has a high porosity (around 23%) and connectivity. Consequently, it was impossible to core the rock into small core rock sample of 9 mm diameter and 18 mm length. We decided to reproduce artificial core rock samples using stainless steel core folder of external sizes 9 x 18 mm and internal size of 7 x 14 mm. We placed in both side one sintered stainless steel sample of 7 mm diameter and 2 mm long and we pressed the Heletz sandstone grains rock sample into the stainless steel folder and sintered discs. The mineralogy, mineral grains sizes and porosity of natural Heletz rock sample were reproduced to mimic the chemical and structural properties of Heletz reservoir. We performed four flow-through experiments at in situ storage conditions (T = 60 ºC, P = 15 MPa, PCO2 = 1.8 MPa). The flow rates injection were 0.05 and 0.30 mL.min-1. Two different brine solutions were used, both representative of the Heletz reservoir native water. The first one was a synthetic brine of the Heletz reservoir (closed to seawater). The second one was the first one equilibrated with gypsum.\nThe results show an increase in permeability and porosity for all the percolation experiment whatever the flow rate and the brine solution. This is explained by the dissolution of dolomite and feldspar. We observed that the permeability increase is higher and faster for high flow rate injection than for low flow rate. Secondary minerals precipitate during the CO2 injection such as clays and gypsum.",

The main focus of CP4O has been on the additional measurement capabilities that are offered by the SAR mode of the SIRAL altimeter, with further work in developing improved geophysical corrections.\nCP4O has developed SAR based ocean products for application in four themes: Open Oceans, Coastal Oceans, Polar Oceans and Sea Floor Topography. The team has developed a number of new processing schemes and compared and evaluated the resultant data products. This work has clearly demonstrated the improved ocean measuring capability offered by SAR mode altimetry and has also added significantly to our understanding of the issues around the processing and interpretation of SAR altimeter echoes.\n The project finishes in the summer of 2014, so this paper presents an overview of the major results and outlines a proposed roadmap for the further development and exploitation of these results in operational and scientific applications.\nThe results are of course also highly relevant to support the planning for future missions, including Sentinel-3 and Jason-CS.\n The “CryoSat Plus for Oceans” (CP4O) project has been supported by ESA (Support To Science Element) and CNES.",

Historical eruptions occurred on the Capelo Peninsula (westernmost sector of the island) during A.D. 1672–1673 and more recently in A.D. 1957–1958. The other exposed volcanic products of the peninsula are so far loosely dated within the Holocene. Here, we present a successful attempt to correlate scoria cones and lava flows yielded by the same eruption on the Capelo Peninsula using paleomagnetic data from 31 sites (10 basaltic scoriae, 21 basaltic lava flows). In the investigated products, we recognize at least six prehistoric clusters of volcanic activity, whereas 11 lava sites are correlated with four scoria cones. Dating was conducted by comparing our paleomagnetic directions with relocated Holocene reference curves of the paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field from France and the UK. We find that the studied volcanic rocks exposed on the Capelo Peninsula are younger than previously believed, being entirely formed in the last 8 k.y., and that the activity intensified over the last 3 k.y. Our study confirms that paleomagnetism is a powerful tool for unraveling the chronology and characteristics of Holocene activity at volcanoes where geochronological age constraints are still lacking",

            "abstract": "The influence of climate on erosion of alpine catchments has been sparsely understood due to the missing temporal or spatial resolution of archives and the quantification of processes. Sediment budget studies in the Alps show severalfold increased lateglacial denudation compared to the present being in line with the concept of paraglacial cycle.\nHere, we present results coupling a 15-ky record of cosmogenic 10Be-derived paleo-denudation rates (n=42) from a 160 m Stappitz lake archive in the Austrian Alps (Seebach-Valley, 34 km2) and a two-year timeseries of the modern stream. The age-depth chronology was established using 14C dates and relative pollen-stratigraphy. Postdepositional correction for the core samples was not necessary due to sufficient shielding while deposited in a lake. Catchment mapping combined with glacial extents reconstructions of revealed prominent lateglacial moraines which likely decoupled the sediment flux from upper valley flanks to the trunk stream since Younger Dryas. Thus, we interpret the denudational pattern as being dominated by the lower hillslopes for the Holocene with only minimal admixing of glacial material. The latter was probably the dominant sediment source in the lateglacial. The beginning of the Holocene shows decreasing denudation rates down to a minimum at 5 ky BP from 1.0 to 0.3 mm/yr. The transition from 5 to 3 ky BP is marked with increasing rates up to the level of the last 3 ky with 0.6 mm/yr, similar to the modern rate. Given the stratigraphy of the core, we attribute the rather low alpine denudation rates to the stabilising effect of vegetation on the hillslopes. Based on an assumed lag time, the denudation rates increase due to the cooler and wetter climate in the late Holocene resulting in less vegetation (on the slopes), more shallow debris-flows and frost cracking. Our results suggest that in the study area climate modulates denudation by dictating vegetation on the hillslopes and efficient frost cracking processes. Importantly, the state of coupling of sediment storage compartments e.g. glacial deposits to the trunk stream has to be considered otherwise nuclide concentrations might be solely a result of mixing. Furthermore, our data seem to contradict the concept of paraglacial cycle. Denudation rate and sediment flux might be not as tightly coupled as commonly assumed.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of deformation processes that occur in the lithosphere during orogenesis can be gained from microstructural analysis of exhumed terranes and shear zones. Here, we use Crystallographic Preferred Orientation (CPO) and Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) data to reveal the kinematic evolution of the metamorphic core of the Himalayan orogen, the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS).\nThe Himalayan orogen is commonly explained with models of channel flow, which describe the GHS as a partially molten, rheologically weak mid crustal channel. Extrusion of the channel was facilitated by coeval reverse- and normal-sense shear zones, at the lower and upper channel margins respectively. Whilst many thermobarometric studies support the occurrence of channel flow, the spatial and temporal distribution of strain within the GHS is one aspect of the model that is yet to be fully resolved. We present a quantified strain proxy profile for the GHS in the Annapurna–Dhaulagiri region of central Nepal and compare our results with the kinematic predictions of the channel flow model.\nSamples were collected along a NS transect through the Kali Gandaki valley of central Nepal for CPO and AMS analysis. Variations in CPO strength are used as a proxy for relative strain magnitude, whilst AMS data provide a proxy for strain ellipsoid shape. Combining this information with field and microstructural observations and thermobarometric constraints reveals the kinematic evolution of the GHS in this region.\nLow volumes of leucogranite and sillimanite bearing rocks and evidence of reverse-sense overprinting normal-sense shearing at the top of the GHS suggest that channel flow was not as intense as model predictions. Additionally, observed EW mineral lineations and oblate strain ellipsoid proxies in the Upper GHS, indicative of three dimensional flattening and orogen parallel stretching, cannot be explained by current channel flow models.\nWhilst the results do not refute the occurrence of channel flow in the Annapurna-Dhaulagiri Himalaya, orogen parallel deformaiton may also play an important role during the evolution of the GHS. Such processes should be fully investigated to understand the role of orogen parallel deformation in the development of the Himalaya to further our knowledge of lithospheric deformation during orogenesis.",

            "abstract": "The study of detrital shocked minerals (DSMs) merges planetary science, sedimentology, mineralogy/crystallography, accessory mineral geochemistry, and geochronology, with the goal of identifying and determining provenance of shock metamorphosed sand grains. Diagnostic high-pressure impact-generated microstructures (planar fractures, planar deformation features) are readily identified on external grain surfaces using standard SEM imaging methods (BSE), and when found, unambiguously confirm an impact origin for a given sand grain. DSMs, including quartz, zircon, monazite, and apatite, have thus far been documented at the Vredefort Dome [1,2,3], Sudbury [4], Rock Elm [5], and Santa Fe [6,7] impact structures. DSMs have been identified in alluvium, colluvium, beach sand, and glacial deposits. Two main processes are recognized that imply the global siliciclastic record contains DSMs: they survive extreme distal transport, and they survive ‘deep time’ lithification. Distal transport: In South Africa, shocked minerals are preserved in alluvium from the Vaal River >750 km downstream from the Vredefort impact; SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology has confirmed the origin of detrital shocked zircon and monazite from shocked Vredefort bedrock [2]. Vredefort-derived shocked zircons have also been found at the mouth of the Orange River on the Atlantic coast, having travelled ~2000 km downriver from Vredefort [8]. Deep time preservation: Vredefort-derived shocked zircon and quartz has been documented in glacial diamictite from the 300 Myr-old Dwyka Group in South Africa. Shocked minerals were thus entrained and transported in Paleozoic ice sheets that passed over Vredefort [9]. An impact crater can thus be viewed as a unique ‘point source’, in some cases for billions of years [2,4]; DSMs thus have applications in studying eroded impact craters, sedimentary provenance, landscape evolution, and long-term sediment transport processes throughout the geologic record.

            "abstract": "Partition coefficients of trace elements are very important for the reconstruction of Earth formation and evolution processes. As such processes typically take place at extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, it is still challenging to obtain experimental data. However, recent developments in super-computing facilities and in computational methods have made it possible to obtain supplementing information on melts and element partitioning from ab initio atomistic calculations.\nThe model system used in this pilot study consists of two different melts: a simple Fe-Ni alloy representing the metal and a silicate phase with a varying ratio of Fe and Mg ((Fe,Mg)2SiO4). Traces of Ni or Cr are added to each system. Molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory are initially run at 2500 K and ambient pressure, using the CPMD and CP2K software packages. Conditions are chosen so that the results can be compared to available experimental data in order to assess the feasibility of the approach and the quality of its results. However, preliminary results at increased pressure and temperature conditions that are more relevant for core formation will be presented as well.\nThe results of the calculations include information on the melt structure, such as coordination environment, nearest neighbor distance and x-ray diffraction structure factors. The calculations at ambient pressure show that the behavior of Ni atoms in the silicate melt shows similarities to Mg and differs clearly from Fe. First results with a Cr trace show that it resembles Fe rather than Ni.\nFurthermore, thermodynamic integration is able to provide thermodynamic information about the exchange of trace elements between both phases. It is possible to obtain the energy difference connected to this exchange, which can then be used to estimate partition factors. First results on the Ni partitioning will be presented.",

The MP densities were 4137.3±2461.5 and 0.167±0.138 n/m3 in the estuarine and the sea waters, respectively. Plastic abundances varied strongly in the estuary. Higher density in the C transect corroborated that rivers were the important sources of MP to the marine environment. MPs (0.5-5mm) constituted more than 90% of total plastics. Plastic particles (> 5 mm) were observed with a maximum size of 12.46 mm. The most frequent plastics were fibres, followed by granules and films. Plastic spherules occurred sparsely.

            "abstract": "Plates move relative to the mantle because some torques are acting on them. The shear in the low-velocity zone (LVZ) at the base of the lithosphere is the expression of these torques. The decoupling is allowed by the low viscosity in the LVZ, which is likely few orders of magnitudes lower than previously estimated. The viscosity value in the LVZ controls the degree of coupling/decoupling between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. Lateral variations in viscosity within the LVZ may explain the velocity gradient among tectonic plates as the one determining the Ethiopian Rift (ER) separating Africa from Somalia. While it remains not fully understood the mechanisms of the torques acting on the lithosphere (thermally driven mantle convection or the combination of mantle convection with astronomical forces such as the Earth's rotation and tidal drag), the stresses are transmitted across the different mechanical layers (e.g., the brittle upper crust, down to the viscous-plastic ductile lower crust and upper mantle). Differential basal shear traction at the base of the lithosphere beneath the two sides of the East African Rift System (EARS) is assumed to drive and sustain rifting. In our analysis, the differential torques acting on the lithospheric/crustal blocks drive kinematics and block rotations. Since, ER involves the whole lithosphere, we do not expect large amount of rotation. Rotation can be the result of the whole plate motion on the sphere moving along the tectonic equator, or the second order sub-rotation of a single plate. Further rotation may occur along oblique plate boundaries (e.g., left lateral transtensional setting at the ER). Small amount of vertical axis rotation of blocks in northern ER could be related to the presence of local, shallower decollement layers. Shallow brittle-ductile transition (BDT) zone and differential tilting of crustal blocks in the northern ER could hint a possibility of detachment surface between the flow in the lower crust relative to the brittle crust above. Our study suggests that kinematics of crustal blocks in the ER is controlled by Africa and Somalia plates interaction at different scale and layers.",

            "abstract": "Rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions coupled with an increasing need to address energy security are resulting in the development of cleaner, more sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuel sources. Bioenergy crops have been proposed to be able to mitigate the effects of climate change as well as provide increased energy security. The aim of this project is to assess the impact of land conversion to second generation non-food bioenergy crops on GHG balance for several land use transitions, including from arable, grassland and forest.\nA network of 6 sites was established across the UK to assess the processes underpinning GHG balance and to provide input data to a model being used to assess the sustainability of different land use transitions. Monthly analysis of soil GHGs shows that carbon dioxide contributes most to the global warming potential of these bioenergy crops, irrespective of transition. Nitrous oxide emissions were low for all crops except arable cropping and methane emissions were very low for all sites. Nearly all sites have shown a significant decrease in CO2 flux from the control land use.\nEddy flux approaches, coupled with soil assessments show that for the transition from grassland to SRC willow there is a significant reduction in GHG emissions from soil and a negative net ecosystem exchange due to increased GPP and ecosystem respiration. These results suggest for this land use transition to bioenergy in a UK specific context, there may be a net benefit for ecosystem GHG exchange of transition to bioenergy\nFinally we are developing a meta-modelling tool to allow land use managers to make location-specific, informed decisions about land use change to bioenergy.\nThis work is based on the Ecosystem Land Use Modelling & Soil Carbon GHG Flux Trial (ELUM) project, which was commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI).

            "abstract": "More than 90% of organic material on Earth resides in sedimentary rocks in the form of kerogens; fossilized organic matter formed through selective preservation of high molecular weight biopolymers under anoxic conditions. Despite its prevalence in the subsurface, the extent to which this material supports microbial metabolisms is unknown. Whilst aerobic microorganisms are known to derive energy from kerogens within shales, utilization in anaerobic microbial metabolisms that proliferate in the terrestrial subsurface, such as microbial iron reduction, has yet to be demonstrated.\nData are presented from microbial growth experiments in which kerogens and shales were supplied as the sole electron donor source for microbial iron reduction by an enrichment culture. Four well-characterized kerogens samples (representative of Types I-IV, classified by starting material), and two shale samples, were assessed. Organic analysis was carried out to investigate major compound classes present in each starting material. Parallel experiments were conducted to test inhibition of microbial iron reduction in the presence of each material when the culture was supplied with a full redox couple.\nThe results demonstrate that iron-reducing microorganisms in this culture were unable to use kerogens and shales as a source of electron donors for energy acquisition, despite the presence of compound classes known to support this metabolism. Furthermore, the presence of these materials was found to inhibit microbial iron reduction to varying degrees, with some samples leading to complete inhibition. These results suggest that recalcitrant carbonaceous material in the terrestrial subsurface is not available for microbial iron reduction and similar metabolisms, such as sulphate-reduction.\nFurther research is needed to investigate the inhibition exerted by these materials, and to assess whether these findings apply to other microbial consortia. These results may have significant implications for the role of anaerobic microbial metabolisms in the subsurface terrestrial carbon cycle. Kerogens are chemically similar to organic material in carbonaceous chondrites. As such, further study may provide insight into the potential availability of organic compounds for microbial metabolisms operating in the subsurface of Mars.",

The changes related to WPE have important societal implications as well. It is clear that human actions are strongly linked with both the causes and the consequences of WPE. At the same time, WPE has proved intractable in the face of attempts to slow or abate the phenomenon. Increasingly, it is being recognized that such complex environmental problems must be treated as social–ecological  systems, that is, coupled human and natural systems. In this presentation, I will discuss recent progress in understanding WPE as a social–ecohydrological system and explore potentially promising approaches that merge insights from multiple disciplines—including hydrology, ecology, remote sensing, economics, and social sciences—as a basis for agent-based models that can improve our understanding of this complex phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "Safe management of the long-lived and high-level radioactive waste originating primarily from nuclear power stations requires isolating and confining the waste for periods up to 100 000 years. Disposal in deep geological formations is currently the solution advocated by international organisations (e.g. the IAEA and the OECD-NEA) and governments, but nowhere in the world is such repository for civilian nuclear waste in operation yet. Concerns about the governance of the involved risks and uncertainties for such long periods lie at the heart of the controversies that have slowed down the identification of a solution. In order to draw lessons potentially relevant for the governance of long-term climate risks, this paper examines the ways in which two interrelated aspects have been addressed in nuclear waste management in France, the US, and the Nordic countries.\nThe first issue concerns “reversibility” – i.e. the possibility on one hand to retrieve the waste once it has been disposed of in a repository, and on the other to return at any point in time along the decision-making process to the previous decision-making phase. Reversibility constitutes today a fundamental, legally binding requirement in French radioactive waste policy. A strategy for managing risk and uncertainty as such, reversibility nevertheless also poses significant safety challenges of its own.\nThe second topic goes beyond the timescales (max. 300 years) in which reversibility is usually considered applicable, addressing the question of intergenerational knowledge transfer, comparing the Nordic and the American approaches to the issue. The key challenge here is ensuring the transfer to the future generations – for periods up to 100 000 years – of sufficient knowledge concerning the siting, characteristics and management of the waste deposited in a repository. Even more fundamentally, instead of knowledge transfer, should we rather aim at “active forgetting”, in order to prevent the curious in the future from intruding into the repository?\nFinally, lessons are drawn for the governance of climate risks, on the basis of the experience of reversibility and intergenerational knowledge transfer in nuclear waste governance.",

            "abstract": "The solar spectral irradiance (SSI) varies on all time scales, and these variations are highly dependent on wavelength. The daily and 27-day solar rotation variations are best understood from many different satellite observations over the past five decades. There has also been much progress in understanding the longer term 11-year solar activity cycle variations. However, instrument degradation corrections are not as accurate as sometimes needed for long-term studies, thus there can be challenges in understanding the solar cycle variations at some wavelengths. In particular, the Harder et al. (GRL, 36, L07801, 2009) results for the near ultraviolet (NUV), visible, and near infrared (NIR) have indicated more NUV variation and some out-of-phase variation for some visible and NIR wavelengths. These variations have been challenged as they are inconsistent with some prior measurements and with some SSI models. A different approach to study the solar cycle variations, but without the need for long-term instrument degradation corrections, is to examine the total energy during isolated solar outburst periods. A solar active region typically appears suddenly and then takes about seven months to decay and disperse back into the quiet Sun network. The isolated outburst period refers to when only one major active region dominates the irradiance variation. The solar outburst energy, which includes all phases of active region evolution, could be considered to be the primary cause for solar cycle variations. Using TIMED, SDO, and SORCE extreme ultraviolet and far ultraviolet observations, the outburst energy (7 months) spectral variation is found to be very similar to their multi-year (solar cycle) variation. The same approach is applied for studying the NUV-Visible-NIR variations from SORCE, and these new results provide a different, and perhaps more accurate, indicator of SSI variation.",

            "abstract": "The Lepsy fault of the northern Tien Shan, SE Kazakhstan is an example of an active structure that connects a more rapidly deforming mountain region with an apparently stable continental region (SCR). The fault extends E-W ~100 km from the high mountains of the Dzhungarian Ala-tau, a sub-range of the northern Tien Shan, into the low-lying Kazakh platform. Our field-based and satellite observations reveal a ∼10 m vertical offset exceptionally preserved along the entire length of the fault. Geomorphic analysis and age control from radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods indicate that this scarp formed in the Holocene and was generated by two substantial earthquakes. The most recent event, which we date to some time after ∼400 years BP, is likely to have ruptured the entire ∼100 km fault length in a Mw 8 earthquake. In spite of the long recurrence times expected for such large SCR earthquakes, they represent a potential earthquake hazard in the increasingly populated Tien Shan foreland region. To characterise the Lepsy fault kinematics we use digital elevation models (DEMs) and high-resolution satellite imagery, which indicate that the predominant sense of motion is reverse right-lateral with a fault strike, dip, and slip vector azimuth of ∼290°, 45/50°S, and 335° respectively, which is consistent with predominant N-S shortening related to the India-Eurasia collision. Finally, the geometry of the western Lepsy fault termination suggests that shortening may also be partly accommodated by counter-clockwise rotation about a vertical axis.",

            "abstract": "Convection in the Earth's outer core is responsible for the generation of the planet's magnetic field and is strongly dependent on interactions between the mantle and inner core. However, despite undergoing vigorous convection, the outer core is not necessarily a single uniform, homogeneous layer of the Earth. Recent seismic and geomagnetic studies suggest that the uppermost outer core is comprised of a chemically distinct layer of stably stratified material. This layer is likely enriched in light elements, which may either be accumulating due to the release of light elements during the solidification of the inner core, or due to a flux of material across the core mantle boundary.\nHere we compile a new dataset of SmKS and PmKP differential travel time data to investigate the vertical and geographical extent of stratification in the uppermost outer core. By jointly considering SmKS and PmKP phases, carefully correcting for known mantle structures, exploring the effect of core mantle boundary topography, and considering changes in the core over recent time, we are able to place new constraints on this stably stratified layer at the top of the outer core.",

            "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of the population earns their living from agriculture, government expenditures in many countries are being re-directed to the sector to increase productivity and decrease poverty. However, many of these investments are seeing low returns because they are poorly targeted. A geographic tool that accounts for spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in the factors of production would allow governments and donors to optimize their investments by directing them to farmers for whom they are most profitable.\nOne application for which this is particularly relevant is fertilizer recommendations. It is well-known that soil fertility in much of sub-Saharan Africa is declining due to insufficient nutrient inputs to replenish those lost through harvest. Since fertilizer application rates in sub-Saharan Africa are several times smaller than in other developing countries, it is often assumed that African farmers are under-applying fertilizer. However, this assumption ignores the risk farmers face in choosing whether or how much fertilizer to apply. Simply calculating the benefit/cost ratio of applying a given level of fertilizer in a particular year over a large, aggregated region (as is often done) overlooks the variability in yield response seen at different sites within the region, and at the same site from year to year.\nUsing Ethiopia as an example, we are developing a 1 km resolution fertilizer distribution tool that provides pre-season fertilizer recommendations throughout the agricultural regions of the country, conditional on seasonal climate forecasts. By accounting for spatial heterogeneity in soil, climate, market and travel conditions, as well as uncertainty in climate and output prices at the time a farmer must purchase fertilizer, this stochastic optimization tool gives better recommendations to governments, fertilizer companies, and aid organizations looking to optimize the welfare benefits achieved by their investments.",

            "abstract": "Ecohydrology of dry forest depends on the proportion of rainfall that enters the soil and it is spatial distribution at the patch scale. While the central role of patch scale redistribution has been widely documented, we know less about its response to rainfall intensity and its interplay with site properties (canopy, surface, soil). Here we explore water capture (infiltrated water depth, 24 hours after a rainfall event) and its determinants at the patch scale in a forest stand of the Dry Chaco (33.47 S, 66.44 W, Argentina). Water capture from 4 large rainfall events (>30 mm) was measured along 3 transects (36 m) in 18 regularly spaced (2 m) microsites, complemented by 2 years of hourly TDR moisture measurements in 3 microsites. Twelve canopy, surface and soil variables were characterized at each microsite. As the intensity of rainfall increased across events (9 to 34 mm/h) the heterogeneity of water capture became larger (coefficient of variation from 29 to 53%). Despite the intense internal redistribution of rainfall, net runoff was virtually nil (<3%) for all events, showing high capture at the stand level. Microsite variables influencing water capture changed with rainfall intensity. Canopy and soil litter cover reduced microsite water capture for the lowest intensity event (r=-0.44 and -0.37, respectively), but favor it for the highest intensity one (r=0.44 and 0.39, respectively). On intermediate intensity events water capture was predominantly explained by microtopography (greater capture in low microsites, p<0.05). Frequent TDR measurements supported these results. Water redistribution responds to rainfall intensity, creating different water capture patterns (contrasting effects of microsite conditions) for each rainfall event, an issue that may strongly influence key ecohydrological process such as E/T partition at the stand level. This study expands our perspective on dry forest water capture by quantifying its response to rainfall intensity.",

            "abstract": "Forest harvesting, insects, disease, wildfire, and other disturbances can combine with climate change to cause unknown changes to the amount and timing of streamflow from critical forested watersheds. Southern Alberta forest and alpine areas provide downstream water supply for agriculture and water utilities that supply approximately two thirds of the Alberta population. This project uses datasets from intensely monitored study watersheds and hydrological model platforms to extend our understanding of how disturbances and climate change may impact various aspects of the streamflow regime that are of importance to downstream users. The objectives are 1) to use the model output of watershed response to disturbances to inform assessments of forested watersheds in the region, and 2) to investigate the use of a new flexible modelling platform as a tool for detailed watershed assessments and hypothesis testing.\nHere we applied the RAVEN hydrological modelling framework to quantify changes in key hydrological processes driving peak and low flows in a headwater catchment along the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The model was applied to simulate the period from 2006 to 2011 using data from the Star Creek watershed in southwestern Alberta. The representation of relevant hydrological processes was verified using snow survey, meteorological, and vegetation data collected through the Southern Rockies Watershed Project. Timber harvest scenarios were developed to estimate the effects of cut levels ranging from 20 to 100% over a range of elevations, slopes, and aspects. We quantified changes in the timing and magnitude of low flow and high flow events during the 2006 to 2011 period. Future work will assess changes in the probability of low and high flow events using a long-term meteorological record. This modelling framework enables relevant processes at the watershed scale to be accounted in a physically robust and computational efficient manner. Hydrologic response to hypothetical harvest scenarios may later be used to help guide forest development planning decisions where detailed assessments of hydrological risk are necessary.",

CS aims to promote and evaluate learning about climate change science among the general public and k-12 students/teachers.\nThe goals of CS are:\n1) Engage teachers, students, and parents in a climate change science communication competition.\n2) Display the winning 6 artworks from K-12 students throughout the LRTA.\n3) Assess the impact of Cool Science on the teaching and learning of climate science in K-12 formal education.\n4) Assess the impact of Cool Science artwork on attitudes, awareness, and understanding of climate change among adult bus riders.\nA naturalistic inquiry employing a mixed methodology approach best describes our research design. The evaluation focuses on providing feedback regarding the potential learning outcomes for the K-12 students who create the media for the project and the general riding public who engage with the student artwork. To identify possible outcomes, data was collected in the several forms: survey, interviews, and online analytics.\nWe see an urgent need to improve both the public’s engagement with climate change science and to the profile of climate change science in formal education settings. The Cool Science (CS) project is an opportunity to bring formal and informal science learning settings together for mutual engagement in the science of climate change.

            "abstract": "Models of magma ascent in the crust tend to either consider the dynamics of fluid flow within intrusions or the associated host-rock deformation. However, these processes are coupled in nature, and so to develop a more complete understanding of magma ascent dynamics in the crust both need to be taken into account. We present a series of gelatine analogue experiments that use both Particle Image Velocimentry (PIV) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques to characterise the dynamics of fluid flow within intrusions and to quantify the associated deformation of the intruded media. Experiments are prepared by filling a 40x40x30 cm3 clear-Perspex tank with a low-concentration gelatine mixture (2-5 wt%) scaled to be of comparable stiffness to crustal strata. Fluorescent seeding particles are added to the gelatine mixture during its preparation and to the magma analogue prior to injection. Two Dantec CCD cameras are positioned outside the tank and a vertical high-power laser sheet positioned along the centre line is triggered to illuminate the seeding particles with short intense pulses. Dyed water (the magma analogue) injected into the solid gelatine from below causes a vertically propagating penny-shaped crack (dike) to form. Incremental and cumulative displacement vectors are calculated by cross-correlation between successive images at a defined time interval. Spatial derivatives map the fluid flow within the intrusion and associated strain and stress evolution of the host, both during dike propagation and on to eruption. As the gelatine deforms elastically at the experimental conditions, strain calculations correlate with stress. Models which couple fluid dynamics and host deformation make an important step towards improving our understanding of the dynamics of magma transport through the crust and to help constrain the tendency for eruption.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the CO2 processes on land is of great importance, because the terrestrial exchange drives the seasonal and interannual variability of CO2 in the atmosphere. Atmospheric inversions based on CO2 concentration measurements alone can only determine net biosphere fluxes, but not differentiate between photosynthesis (uptake) and respiration (production). Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) could provide an important additional constraint: it is also taken up by plants during photosynthesis but not emitted during respiration, and therefore is a potential means to differentiate between these processes. Solar absorption Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometry allows for the retrieval of the atmospheric concentrations of both CO2 and OCS. Here, we investigate co-located and nearly simultaneous measurements of OCS and CO2 measured at 3 sites via FTIR spectrometers. These northern-hemispheric sites span a wide range of latitudes and all have multiple year time-series. The sites include Ny-Alesund (79°N), Bremen (53°N) and Paramaribo (6°N). We compare these measurements to simulations of OCS and CO2 using the GEOS-Chem model. The simulations are driven by different land biospheric fluxes of OCS and CO2 to match the seasonality of the measurements. The simple biosphere model (SiB-COS) are used in the study because it simultaneously calculates the biospheric fluxes of both OCS and CO2. The CO2 simulation with SiB fluxes agrees with the measurements better than a simulation using CASA. Comparison of the OCS simulations with different fluxes indicates that the latitudinal distribution of the OCS fluxes within SiB needs to be adjusted.",

The NSF-GeoPRISMS Mini-lesson Project, funded by NSF-TUES, is designed to integrate the significant findings from the MARGINS program into open-source college-level curriculum. The Gulf of California (GOC) served as the focus site for the Rupturing Continental Lithosphere (RCL) initiative, which addressed several scientific questions: What forces drive rift initiation, localization, propagation and evolution? How does deformation vary in time and space, and why? How does crust evolve, physically and chemically, as rifting proceeds to sea-floor spreading? What is the role of sedimentation and magmatism in continental extension?\nWe developed two weeks of curriculum, including lectures, labs, and in-class activities that can be used as a whole or individually. This component of the curriculum introduces students to the Euler pole description of relative plate motion (RPM) by examining the tectonic interactions of the Baja California microplate and North American plate. The plate boundary varies in rift obliquity along strike, from highly oblique and strike-slip dominated in the south to slightly less oblique and with a larger extensional component in the north. This Google Earth-based exercise provides students with a visualization of RPM using small circle contours of the local direction and magnitude of Baja-North America movement on a spherical Earth. Students use RPM to calculate the fault slip rates on transform, normal, and oblique-slip faults and examine how the varying faulting styles combine to accommodate RPM. MARGINS results are integrated via comparison of rift obliquity with the structural style of rift-related faults around the GOC. We find this exercise to fit naturally into courses about plate tectonics, geophysics, and especially structural geology, given the similarity between Euler pole rotations and stereonet-based rotations of structural data.",

            "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) offers a quantitative approach for comparison of topographic profiles. We have previously compared simple shapes of topographic profiles of rifts and uplifts on Venus and Earth. Although yielding some interesting results, these studies were more qualitative than quantitative. We address this by applying PCA to sets of topographic profiles on the two planets. Doing so yields not only groupings of like features in what we call “PC-space,\" but also the actual shapes of principal component profiles. PC-space consists of a modified ternary diagram showing the relative contributions of the three strongest principal components derived from a particular data set. The first PC profile generally shows a simple broad uplift, while profiles 2 and 3 display more complexity, which we attribute to lithospheric response to loading. Regardless of size of data set, the top three components account for about 95% of the shape of a feature’s profile, so we concentrate our analysis on these three components.\nWe first look at a data set with several forms of uplift – mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts, and continental and oceanic hotspots on Earth, and chasmata and regiones from Venus. Subsets based on the groupings from this original data set are examined. Specifically, the hotspot data set is tested looking at potential differences between oceanic and continental, and Types 1, 2, and 3 as defined by Courtillot. We look for correlations between terrestrial features and venusian chasmata and regiones. The effect of spreading rate on mid-ocean ridge topography is examined and compared to chasmata.",

            "abstract": "In many regions of the worlds, studies of past hydrological variability have to rely on hydrological models either because river gauge measurement is not available or because measurements do not reflect the natural flow due to water diversion or reservoir regulation. However, results from these studies are subject to major uncertainty related to the challenges in quantifying vegetation conditions and evapotranspiration, both of which are important for surface water and energy budgets. This study incorporates satellite remote sensing data for ET and vegetation into the VIC model to improve the model performance in simulating the surface water budget, hydrological seasonality, and timing of hydrological extremes. Using the Connecticut River Basin as an example, and driven with the NASA NLDAS-2 meteorological forcing data, the VIC model has been modified to read in LAI and ET data derived from MODIS among others. The MODIS LAI data provides VIC with the inter-annually varying seasonal cycle of vegetation, and the MODIS ET data replaces the model simulated ET. The data-enhanced model performs significantly better in simulating river discharge, its magnitude, seasonality, timing, soil moisture and its temporal variation. Incorporation of the ET data led to an increase of stream flow correlations between model and observations on the daily and biweekly temporal scales, and the seasonality is better represented on a monthly scale with particular magnitude improvements during the summer when ET is greatest. Incorporation of the LAI data led to improved simulation of inter-annual variability. This joint application of remote sensing and modeling helps quantify the extent to which remote sensing data improves model performance, facilitates a more accurate understanding and attribution of past hydrological variability/changes, and helps characterize the range of model-related uncertainties in future predictions.",

The campaign’s goal is to design, implement, and study the efficacy of an OHMM model for free choice science learning about our changing climate. Subway riders represent a diverse and captive audience with most of them spending an average of one hour a day in the subway system. Through the use of specially designed OHMM such as train placards, platform posters, and virtual resources the campaign engages a potential audience of 500,000 riders/day with opportunities to learn climate change science informally.\nThe primary goal of the ScienceToGo.org campaign is to engage, entertain, and educate the adult subway riding community in major U.S. city about climate change as a real, relevant, and solvable local challenge. A naturalistic quasi-experimental inquiry employing a mixed methodology approach best describes our research design with half of the subway system exposed to the project signage (experimental group) and the other half not being exposed to the project signage (control group). To identify possible outcomes, data was collected in the several forms: survey, analytic data associated with website, social media, web app, focus groups, and observations. This campaign is an example of how an individual’s daily routine may be enhanced with an informal science learning opportunity.\nWe see an urgent need to improve both the public’s engagement with climate change science and to the profile of climate change science in formal education settings. The campaign makes deliberate use of humor and fun to engage a public and diverse audience with the serious issue of climate change. The research that will be presented will reveal some of the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy when communicating science to a diverse audience. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that humor and fun are effective at engaging riders on mass transit. Mass transit spaces represent a promsing medium for further exploration and development when it comes to informal learning about climate change science.",

            "abstract": "Most general circulation models (GCMs) exhibit a low bias in cloud cover in the southern oceans, which has a significant impact on the amount of absorbed solar radiation. This, in turn, has been proposed to affect various aspects of the global climate, for example excess in southern hemisphere tropical precipitation, also known as the double inter-tropical convergence zone problem. The southern oceans are strongly influenced by extratropical cyclones, and it was found that the cold sector of these cyclones is one area where models, including reanalyses, do not produce enough clouds.\nBy combining multiple NASA A-train and Terra observations of cloud properties, precipitation, water vapor, temperatures and winds, we explore the processes that produce clouds in midlatitude cyclones. We divide the cyclones into their different sectors and explore the dominant cloud types and their relation with the environment using compositing techniques. For this we use a cyclone database and two different algorithms to detect cold and warm fronts in order to delineate the different sectors of the cyclones. We use the same techniques to analyze model outputs, so we can directly compare observations and models.\nWe will present results on the mechanisms that control cloud production in the post cold frontal region of the extratropical cyclones. By using both passive and active observations, we are able to provide a three dimensional view of these mechanisms. With these results, we then test two GCMs, one that underestimates southern hemisphere clouds and the other that overestimates cloud amounts in this region. We will show how the convection and planetary boundary layer parameterizations and the lower tropospheric moist stability interact and provide a key indicator of GCM post-frontal cloud content in these storms.",

            "abstract": "Whistler waves are characteristic of collisionless fast mode shocks. Recent Polar observations at Earth’s bow shock have revealed copious whistlers in the lower-hybrid frequency range [Hull et al., JGR, 2012]. The waves have wavelengths comparable to the ion inertia length and propagate obliquely to both the magnetic field B0 and the shock normal. Earth’s bow shock being supercritical, reflected ions play a fundamental role and, in particular, determine its macrostructure which consists of a foot, a ramp, and an overshoot region. Here, we investigate the possible interaction between the oblique whistlers and the reflected ions in the shock’s foot. The problem considered is characterized by a double anisotropy: one defined by the direction of B0, the other by that of the reflected beam. Let Ψ be the plane defined by these two directions, presumably the magnetic coplanarity plane. The Cerenkov resonance condition reads ω = k Ure sin θbk cos ψvk , where Ure denotes the drift of the beam of reflected ions seen in the solar wind frame, θbk is the angle between the wavevector and B0, and ψvk is the angle between the wavevector and the plane Ψ.\nWe exploit Themis burst mode and its three-axis field measurements in order to simultaneously characterize the whistlers (wavevector direction and module) and the ion beam (velocity direction and module). The resonance condition above is then examined in this light. Modelling the ion beam, we use our electromagnetic dispersion code [see companion paper in this session] to compute the linear characteristics of the oblique whistlers that can be excited and compare them with the observations. Moreover, waveforms and hodograms obtained from an electromagnetic PIC simulation are also compared with Themis measurements.",

            "abstract": "Jakobshavn Glacier, West Greenland, has responded to temperature changes in Ilulissat Icefjord, into which it terminates. We collected hydrographic observations inside this silled fjord and from adjacent Disko Bay between 2001 and 2014. In the fjord basin, the summer mean temperature was 2.8 ◦C from 2009 to 2013, excluding 2010, when it was 1 ◦C cooler. Despite this variability, summer potential densities in the basin were in the narrow range 27.20 ≤ σθ≤ 27.31 and basin water properties matched those of Disko Bay in this density layer each summer. This relation has likely held since at least 1980, implying that basin waters from 2009 and 2011-2013 were similar to those in 1998 and 1999, when Jakobshavn Glacier began to retreat, while basin waters as cool as in 2010 were likely last present in the 1980s.\nThe 2010 basin temperature anomaly reflected larger-scale advection into Disko Bay, not local weather variability. This anomaly also shows that Ilulissat Icefjord basin waters were renewed annually or faster. Mooring time series and data from instrumented seals and halibut did not capture the 2010 anomaly but show that the basin and Disko Bay bottom temperatures vary little sub-annually, outside of summer, while fjord velocity profiles from summer 2013 imply a basin renewal timescale of about one month. Model simulations indicate that subglacial discharge from Jakobshavn Glacier could drive renewal of the fjord basin over a single summer, while baroclinic forcing from outside the fjord can not, due to the sill at the mouth. The silled nature of Ilulissat Icefjord therefore makes its renewal dynamics different from Sermilik Fjord, in east Greenland, which is rapidly renewed by external forcing.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate precipitation in oceanic olivine-bearing rocks provides a natural case to study engineered CO2-sequestration via olivine carbonation. ODP Site 1275 recovered tectonically denuded gabbro and troctolite on the west flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (15°45’N). Carbonate veins comprise ~0.15 vol.% of the recovered core, corresponding to CO2 uptake of only 0.075 wt.%. However, troctolite cores are comprised of 0.8 vol.% calcite veins, and individual troctolite samples contain up to 15 vol.% calcite that directly replaced olivine in association with talc.\nCarbonate precipitated from multiple types of fluids during and following denudation. Calcite replaced olivine concurrently with the formation of high-temperature (δ18OSMOW = 11 to 20‰, corresponding to 75-180°C for fluid δ18OSMOW of 0‰) calcite veins in active shear zones. These veins are enriched in LREEs (2-10x chondrite) with strong positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 5 to 500), and have 87/86Sr ratios of ~0.704 and δ13CVPDB ranging from -2 to -5‰. Later veins (70% calcite and 30% aragonite) cut high-T veins. These veins precipitated near seawater temperatures (δ18OSMOW ~ 35.1), and have seawater C and Sr isotopic signatures. Both late calcite and aragonite veins have lower REE contents than high-T veins and have little or no Eu anomalies; aragonite veins have negative Ce anomalies. These low-T veins precipitated in both gabbro and troctolite from seawater with varying degrees of rock interaction. High-T veins and replacive calcite precipitated from a mixture of seawater and high-T hydrothermal fluids, and are common in troctolite but rare in gabbro. Geochemical reaction path modeling suggests that the replacive calcite-talc assemblage in troctolite forms only at high fluid-to-rock ratios. The calcite’s low 87/86Sr ratios, however, indicate that the seawater-derived fluids had exchanged Sr with large volumes of rock. The olivine carbonation may hence result from upflow of deeply rooted fluids during basement denudation.",

Contemporary accounts mention precursor earthquakes and describe darkness in the Land district to the west of the volcano, which was caused by the ~19km high and east-southeast-drifting eruption plume. The accounts also indicate first sighting of the eruption plume at sites some 80 km downwind from the volcano around 10 am and with visible tephra fall at ~11 am. An hour later the tephra fall began to dissipate and had stopped by 3 pm. Three ships of the southeast coast of Iceland report tephra falling on their deck and sails and records of tephra fall are as also known from the Faeroe and Shetland Islands.\nThe initial explosive phase of the 1845 eruption lasted for about one hour, featuring mass eruption rate of ~104 m3 s-1 and produced a well-defined tephra fall sector covering approximately 10000 km2 within the 1 mm isopach. The total volume of the tephra from the initial phase is calculated at ~0.04km3 DRE. The average density obtained from three sets of “100-clast” samples ranges from 560-690 kg m-3. All of these samples exhibit a tight unimodal distribution with a calculated mean vesicularity of 74-79%.. These data also indicate a subtle decrease in maximum and mean vesicularity through the opening phase, from 88% to 82% and 79% to 75% respectively, which coincides with upward decrease in grain size (i.e. intensity) within proximal sections. The initial phase of the 1845 Hekla eruption was short lived and its products are exceptionally well preserved in Icelandic soils. As such it is ideal for studies of vesiculation and fragmentation processes and we will present new data on pumice vesicle size distribution as well as on total deposit grain size distribution.",

We deployed biogeochemical Lagrangian floats in the eastern tropical North Pacific during a research cruise in May/June 2014, where transport of high chlorophyll waters from the coast were inferred from satellite imagery. These Lagrangian floats are automonous platforms with the ability to follow isopycnals and were equipped with a suite of gas tension devices and other sensors to measure N2(g), O2, NO3- and NO2- concentrations. We concurrently collected discrete samples to calibrate and complement float measurements. We present here biogenic N2, i.e. N2 produced by local N-loss processes and derived from measured N2/Ar and δ15N-N2 anomaly, i.e. the difference between δ15N-N2 observed and at equilibrium for in-situ temperature and salinity, during a ~4 weeks Lagrangian experiment. During N-loss, the product (N2) is depleted in 15N because of kinetic isotope fractionation. While biogenic N2 only reached up to ~10 µmol/kg, the δ15N-N2 anomalies were relatively low (down to ~-0.4‰). The δ15N-N2 anomalies are low compared to values always >-0.1‰) for equivalent biogenic N2 in the OMZ of the eastern tropical South Pacific. We will discuss the implication of these results for the global oceanic N budget.",

            "abstract": "Terraces eroded into sediment (cut-fill) and bedrock (strath) preserve a geomorphic record of river activity. River terraces are often thought to form when a river switches from a period of low vertical incision rates and valley widening to high vertical incision rates and terrace abandonment. Consequently, terraces are frequently interpreted to reflect landscape response to changing external drivers, including tectonics, sea-level, and most commonly, climate. In contrast, unsteady lateral migration in meandering rivers may generate river terraces even under constant vertical incision and without changes in external forcing. To explore this latter mechanism, we use a numerical model and an automated terrace detection algorithm to simulate landscape evolution by a vertically incising, meandering river and isolate the age and geometric fingerprints of intrinsically generated river terraces. Simulations indicate that terraces form for a wide range of lateral and vertical incision rates, and the time interval between unique terrace levels is limited by a characteristic timescale for relief generation. Surprisingly, intrinsically generated terraces are commonly paired, an attribute that is thought to be diagnostic of climate change. For low ratios of vertical-to-lateral erosion rates, modeled terraces are longitudinally extensive and typically dip toward the valley center, and terrace slope is proportional to the ratio of vertical to lateral erosion. Evolving, spatial differences in bank strength between bedrock and sediment reduce terrace formation frequency and length, and can explain sub-linear terrace margins at valley boundaries. Comparison of model predictions to natural river terraces indicates that terrace length is the most reliable indicator of terrace formation by pulses of vertical incision, and may contain the imprint of past climate change on landscapes.",

Variations in dynamic support of the lithosphere, due to transient behavior of the Iceland mantle plume, probably control spatial and temporal water depth variations this region. Pathways and intensities of oceanic bottom currents, together with deposition of contourite drifts, are strongly influenced by changing bathymetry. Here, we combine detailed observations of contourite drift deposits from seismic reflection profiles with a chronology of plume activity, to test the relationships between deep-water circulation, sedimentary drift accumulation and mantle convection. We present multi-channel seismic reflection profiles acquired over Bjorn, Gardar and Hatton Drifts in the Iceland Basin and over the northernmost portion of Eirik Drift, east of Greenland. Depositional hiatuses are easily identified and correlated between these high-quality images and nearby boreholes, which allows us to construct history of sedimentation across the North Atlantic Ocean over the past 5 Ma. We observe kilometer-scale westward-migration of Bjorn Drift, which can be explained by varying current strength and sediment supply, probably moderated by fluctuating dynamic support on overall subsidence. We place these observations into a new continuous 55 Ma record of Iceland mantle plume activity. There is compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that variations in mantle convection deep beneath the plates has profound consequences for deep-water flow and sediment deposition at Earth’s surface.",

Along with hosting field trips and short course for subjects like Marine Biology, Aquatic Ecology and Coastal Geology, the ABCRC has recently hosted Professional Development programs for public school Art teachers and a Nature Writing class for college students. These interdisciplinary programs are part of the ABCRC’s participation in the Ecological Reflections Program (\nhttp://www.ecologicalreflections.com/\n) sponsored by The National Science Foundation and the LTER Network, with a goal of tying VCR-LTER data with the Humanities to increase appreciation of coastal environments and the ecosystem services they provide. Participants in these interdisciplinary programs are exposed to cutting edge field research and immersed (often quite literally) in coastal environments while they practice their art forms. The resulting paintings, drawings, nature essays and short stories demonstrate the impacts exposure to natural environments can have on program participants and how these experiences may shape their future works.

            "abstract": "Not only will young adults bear the brunt of climate change’s effects, they are also the ones who will be required to take action – to mitigate and to adapt. The Next Generation Science Standards include climate change, ensuring the topic will be covered in U.S. science classrooms in the near future. Additionally, school is a primary source of information about climate change for young adults. The larger question, though, is how can the teaching of climate change be done in such a way as to ascribe agency – a willingness to act – to students? Framing – as both a theory and an analytic method – has been used to understand how language in the media can affect the audience’s intention to act. Frames function as a two-way filter, affecting both the message sent and the message received. This study adapted both the theory and the analytic methods of framing, applying them to teachers in the classroom to answer the research question: How do teachers frame climate change in the classroom? To answer this question, twenty-five lessons from seven teachers were analyzed using semiotic discourse analysis methods. It was found that the teachers’ frames overlapped to form two distinct discourses: a Science Discourse and a Social Discourse. The Science Discourse, which was dominant, can be summarized as: Climate change is a current scientific problem that will have profound global effects on the Earth’s physical systems. The Social Discourse, used much less often, can be summarized as: Climate change is a future social issue because it will have negative impacts at the local level on people. While it may not be surprising that the Science Discourse was most often heard in these science classrooms, it is possibly problematic if it were the only discourse used. The research literature on framing indicates that the frames found in the Science Discourse – global scale, scientific statistics and facts, and impact on the Earth’s systems – are not likely to inspire action-taking. This study indicates that framing may be a useful theory for investigating how climate change is taught and learned in classrooms. In addition, suggestions are made for how to develop effective professional development for teachers to improve their communication of climate change.",

Cobb Seamount is the oldest (3.3 Ma) and furthest from the hotspot source. Cobb exhibits a circular volcanic edifice that rises from ~2800 m at its base to within 34 m of the sea surface. Multibeam bathymetry of Cobb indicates there are wave-cut terraces at the summit, as well as landslide scars along the flanks of the volcano. Brownbear Seamount (0.5-1.5 Ma) has an elongated (N-S) shape, which indicates an interaction of the hotspot plume with the extensional-stress field of the JdF spreading center. Brownbear also has two (~4 km wide) summit calderas which likely formed due to collapse once plate motion moved the seamount west of the magma source. Axial Seamount, in contrast, is the volcanic edifice directly above hotspot plume and is therefore in a constructional phase. Axial also straddles the ridge and because of this exhibits an elongate structure with well defined rift zones forming its northern and southern flanks. Axial also has a single large summit caldera (~8 km wide) which has been the location of two eruptions in 1998 and 2011 which produced extensive lava flows within the caldera and down the south rift zone. We will present multibeam bathymetry of these three volcanoes, and include the results of previous surveys and observations, to infer the evolution of the volcanic construction and destruction processes through time along this seamount chain.",

In these environments, minor differences in rainfall distribution can invoke significant ecosystem response. The Grand Canyon, Arizona is an iconic dryland environment that receives less than 430 mm of annual rainfall. Recent monitoring of desertification processes at culturally sensitive landscapes in Grand Canyon has examined variability in vegetation, soil crusts, and runoff induced erosion, and identified a lack of knowledge about the nature, drivers and effects of local rainfall variability. We examine rainfall variability using five years of high resolution data collected from 11 weather stations distributed along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon, coupled with 60 years of lower resolution data from National Weather Service Cooperative Observer (NOAA COOP) stations. We characterize spatial and temporal variability in 10-minute rainfall intensity, an important predictor of soil erosion, and daily rainfall depth, an important predictor of biotic cover. We quantify the intensity-daily depth relationship to infer long-term variability in rainfall intensity from the NOAA COOP data that only record rainfall depth. Results confirm findings from previous studies showing a bi-seasonally rainfall pattern with longer duration-lower intensity storms in the cool season and shorter duration-higher intensity storms during the North American Monsoon (NAM).Seasonal differences in rainfall intensity-depth relationships are significant, and suggest NAM storms have greater potential to produce erosion-generating intensities. As NAM rainfall is spatially and inter-annually more variable than cool season rain, yearly rain depths are strongly influenced by NAM fluctuations. These findings will be useful in future efforts to track desertification processes in this and other drylands characterized by complex topography and extreme rainfall heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Systematic temporal-compositional variations observed in many monogenetic vent eruption sequences (e.g. decreasing incompatible element concentrations, variation in major element and isotopic compositions) may reflect varying extents of crustal contamination (c.f., [1]), or melting and mixing of small-scale mantle heterogeneities (c.f., [2]). During eruption of the Papoose Canyon (PC) monogenetic vent incompatible trace element concentrations decreased a factor of 2, 87Sr/86Sr decreased (from ~0.7063 to 0.7055), and 143Nd/144Nd increased (from ~0.51246 to 0.51258) (c.f., [2]). Blondes et al. (2008) argued that the relatively primitive melt MgO content and apparent presence of mantle xenoliths in the sequence indicate limited melt storage and crustal contamination prior to eruption, and proposed melting and mixing of two distinct mantle components to explain the variations. However, PC olivine phenocryst compositions (Fo# ~76-89) span a wide range, extending to evolved (low-Fo) compositions, and the vast majority of phenocrysts are more evolved than olivines in equilibrium with the host scoria (Mg# ~87-89). In addition, olivine and clinopyroxene from xenoliths within the early sequence have Mg# (73-87) similar to the phenocrysts, and lower than typical mantle peridotites. Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of the xenoliths are similar to the early PC lavas, but less enriched than the host melts. Therefore, the xenoliths are most likely cognate xenoliths derived from fractionated PC magmas. Finally, both phenocryst and xenolith olivines have δ18O (~5.5 to 5.7 ‰) higher than most mantle peridotites (~5.2 ±0.2 ‰), and clinopyroxene trace element abundances indicate derivation from melts with trace element abundances higher than the most enriched PC lavas. In conjunction, these features suggest that the phenocrysts and xenoliths derive from early PC melts that ponded and fractionated and assimilated continental crust, possibly in crustal sills. These melts were drained and mixed with more primitive melts as the eruption began, and the temporal-compositional trends in part reflect decreasing contaminated sill component over time. These results indicate that even “primitive” melts may contain a significant signature of crustal contamination.\n[1] Erlund et al., 2010.\n[2] Blondes et al., 2008.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes adapt to changes in sea level by means of biogeomorphological feedback. These feedbacks maintain a dynamic equilibrium with sea level, within limits. Reconstructions of sea-level changes derived from salt‑marsh sediment provide a paleo perspective for evaluating these feedbacks and for predicting the ecological effects of future sea-level rise. The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM) was modified to accommodate long records of sea level and sediment physical and chemical variables derived from high resolution (decadal and decimeter) reconstruction of sea level spanning the late Holocene using foraminifera preserved in North Carolina salt-marsh sediments. Model outputs from a run of nearly 1100-yr show periods of time when the marsh was predicted to be positioned near the top of the tidal frame (inundation time near zero) and times when the marsh was much deeper in the intertidal zone (inundation time of ca. 0.4). An elevation at mean sea level would correspond to an inundation time of 0.5, which is close to the lower limit of the vegetation and is indicative of a marsh that is just forming or, alternatively, a marsh that is on the verge of collapse. The model also indicates that the standing biomass on the marsh surface and sediment organic matter (SOM) content would have varied in harmony with the inundation time. In times past when the inundation time and the opportunity for mineral sedimentation decreased, the sediment organic matter (SOM) content increased. The low SOM concentration near the marsh surface today is consistent with a marsh that is low in the tidal frame. The SOM depth profile is a function of the relative elevation of the marsh, as well as changes in the input of inorganic sediment to the estuary. To effectively manage and preserve valuable salt-marsh ecosystems it is critical to accurately predict their response to projected sea-level changes.",

            "abstract": "Observations and model simulations of temperature and tracer profiles in the extratropical upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) show the presence of an inversion layer just above the thermal tropopause, i.e., the tropopause inversion layer (TIL), which is situated in a region affected by stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). Moreover, from a dynamical perspective the extratropical UTLS is highly affected by baroclinic life cycles. Since both the TIL and STE emerge, amongst many other features, during simulated baroclinic life cycles, we study whether there is a relationship between the TIL and STE.\nWe use the non-hydrostatic model COSMO in an idealized mid-latitude channel configuration to simulate baroclinic life cycles. In a first step contributions of individual diabatic processes from turbulence, radiation, and cloud microphysics to the formation of the TIL are analyzed. These results are compared to those from adiabatic simulations in which the TIL forms during the life cycles with the limitation of being less sharp than in observations. Furthermore, passive tropospheric and stratospheric tracers are used to identify STE. Regions of STE are then analyzed with respect to the temporal evolution of the static stability above the tropopause.\nThe results suggest that radiative effects, especially from water vapor, have the largest additional contribution to the TIL formation, while additional individual effects of cloud microphysics are almost negligible. STE occurs in all diabatic simulations but its strength depends highly on how the underlying diabatic process can affect the thermal and dynamical structure in the tropopause region. Weak STE is found when considering cloud microphysics, while STE is stronger in case of using turbulence and radiation. Tropopause-based vertical profiles of the tropospheric tracers show in some cases similarities with observed tracer profiles of CO.",

            "abstract": "Lakes are a key feature of arctic landscapes and can be an important component of regional organic carbon budgets. Although numerous, arctic lakes are comparatively under-studied and organic carbon burial rates are not well prescribed. Moreover, it has been proposed that regional warming will increase aquatic production in the Arctic. Here we test this hypothesis using 210Pb-dated sediment cores from SW Greenland, an area that did not warm appreciably during the 20th century. Organic carbon accumulation rates (OC AR) were estimated for 16 lakes that cover a climate gradient from the dry, continental interior to the wetter coastal margin. The study span a range of water chemistries (conductivity values range 25–3400 uS/cm), lake areas (<4–77 ha), and maximum depths (range ~10–50 m); the average OC AR rate (derived from all lakes) corrected for sediment focussing (using the mean 210Pb flux method) was low (<3 g C m^2/yr). Twelve lakes showed an increase in mean OC AR for the time period covered by 210Pb, possibly attributable to global environmental change processes (for example, reactive N deposition) rather than climate warming. There are ca. 20,000 lakes in the study area ranging from ~1 ha to >130 km^2, although over 83% of lakes are <10 ha. The mean post-1950 OC AR (3.5 g C m^2/yr) was extrapolated to all lakes <100 ha and a lower rate of ca. 2 g C m^2/yr to large lakes (>1000 ha) and suggests a regional annual lake OC burial rate of ca. 11 x 10^9 g C/yr after 1950. These burial rates are also compared with estimates of CO2 fluxes from the lakes. The implications of these data and their associated limitations (problems of determining C burial in remote lakes, regional upscaling, in-lake spatial variability, post-depositional mineralization) for regional carbon sequestration by lakes are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The first part of this work presents results based on the longest series measuring downward shortwave radiation (DSR) available at the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) over Europe. Particular emphasis is placed upon the quality control and homogenization of the dataset, which has been checked for temporal homogeneity by means of different relative homogeneity tests. The mean annual DSR series shows an increase from the 1930s to the early 1950s (i.e. early brightening period), followed by a reduction until mid-1980s (i.e., dimming period), and ending with an increase up to the present (i.e., brightening period). Unfortunately, there exists a substantial gap in direct measurements of DSR as only few stations in Europe provide records before the 1960s. To overcome the lack of direct measurements, the analysis can be supported with other proxy variables more widely measured, such as sunshine duration (SD) records. Thus, in this work we also present the reconstructed DSR variations since late 19th century in Europe based on the SD series over Europe with around one century of records, some of them starting in the 1880s. The reconstructed DSR variations have been estimated by using the relationship found between the SD series and a satellite-derived DSR dataset (0.03 x 0.03 of spatial resolution), provided by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF), during the common 1983-2005 subperiod. The reconstructed records have been validated by using the GEBA series described in the first part of this work. The temporal evolution of the mean DSR annual series since the 1950s is characterized by the well-known dimming and brightening periods. Moreover, an early brightening period is also detected during the first half of the 20th century, although regional differences are observed with areas over Europe where the DSR show no increase in this subperiod. Interestingly, the reconstructed DSR also highlight an absolute minimum in 1912, which should be the signal of the Katmai volcanic eruption (i.e., largest volcanic eruption in the 20th century) as the consequence of the direct effect of the volcanic sulphur aerosols released in the volcanic eruption. The results highlight the suitability of SD records to detect changes in DSR under all-sky and clear-sky conditions (e.g., due to aerosol changes).",

            "abstract": "Defending society against natural hazards is a high-stakes game of chance against nature, involving tough decisions. How should a developing nation allocate its budget between building schools for towns without ones or making existing schools earthquake-resistant? Does it make more sense to build levees to protect against floods, or to prevent development in the areas at risk? Would more lives be saved by making hospitals earthquake-resistant, or using the funds for patient care?\nThese topics are challenging because they are far from normal experience, in that they involve rare events and large sums. To help students in natural hazard classes conceptualize them, we pose tough and thought-provoking questions about complex issues involved and explore them together via lectures, videos, field trips, and in-class and homework questions. We discuss analogous examples from the students’ experiences, drawing on a new book “Playing Against Nature, Integrating Science and Economics to Mitigate Natural Hazards in an Uncertain World”. Asking whether they wear bicycle helmets and why or why not shows the cultural perception of risk. Individual students’ responses vary, and the overall results vary dramatically between the US, UK, and Germany. Challenges in hazard assessment in an uncertain world are illustrated by asking German students whether they buy a ticket on public transportation – accepting a known cost - or “ride black” - not paying but risking a heavy fine if caught. We explore the challenge of balancing mitigation costs and benefits via the question “If you were a student in Los Angeles, how much more would you pay in rent each month to live in an earthquake-safe building?”\nStudents learn that interdisciplinary thinking is needed, and that due to both uncertainties and sociocultural factors, no unique or right strategies exist for a particular community, much the less all communities. However, we can seek robust policies that give sensible results given uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes pose a significant threat to society in the U.S. and around the world. The risk is easily forgotten given the infrequent recurrence of major damaging events, yet the likelihood of a major earthquake in California in the next 30 years is greater than 99%. As our societal infrastructure becomes ever more interconnected, the potential impacts of these future events are difficult to predict.\nYet, the same inter-connected infrastructure also allows us to rapidly detect earthquakes as they begin, and provide seconds, tens or seconds, or a few minutes warning. A demonstration earthquake early warning system is now operating in California and is being expanded to the west coast (www.ShakeAlert.org). In recent earthquakes in the Los Angeles region, alerts were generated that could have provided warning to the vast majority of Los Angelinos who experienced the shaking. Efforts are underway to build a public system. Smartphone technology will be used not only to issue that alerts, but could also be used to collect data, and improve the warnings. The MyShake project at UC Berkeley is currently testing an app that attempts to turn millions of smartphones into earthquake-detectors. As our development of the technology continues, we can anticipate ever-more automated response to earthquake alerts. Already, the BART system in the San Francisco Bay Area automatically stops trains based on the alerts. In the future, elevators will stop, machinery will pause, hazardous materials will be isolated, and self-driving cars will pull-over to the side of the road.\nIn this presentation we will review the current status of the earthquake early warning system in the US. We will illustrate how smartphones can contribute to the system. Finally, we will review applications of the information to reduce future losses.",

            "abstract": "To investigate CO2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in sandstones, we performed 150°C flow-through experiments on K-feldspar rich cores from the Eau Claire Formation. We observed mass transfer processes operating on a range of scales by measuring sample porosity, permeability, and surface area and fluid and solid chemistry. The close agreement between our measured K-feldspar dissolution rates and literature values demonstrate that feldspar-fluid interaction can be confidently modeled using our chosen rate parameters and characterization methods, but other hydrogeochemical processes evolve somewhat less predictably. Specifically, a sandstone core through which CO2-rich deionized water was recycled for 52 days decreased in porosity and permeability and increased in surface area while an Al hydroxide mineral, such as boehmite, precipitated within its pore space. However, two samples subjected to ~3 day single-pass experiments run with CO2-rich NaCl brines generally increased in porosity and surface area and decreased in permeability as K-feldspar was converted to a phase with kaolinite-like stoichiometry. Notably, boehmite remained two orders of magnitude less supersaturated than kaolinite in all samples from all experiments, and we therefore hypothesize that the identity of the secondary phase is related to the presence of NaCl in solution. Regardless of their identity, long-lived secondary phase supersaturations and low measured Al molalities suggest that Al is precipitated at approximately the same rate at which it is released to solution through feldspar hydrolysis. Finally, we note that, although core permeability measurably decreased in all three experiments, the magnitude of these changes is unlikely to impact CO2 injectivity over a CCUS reservoir's lifetime. The observations produced here are critical to the application of reactive transport models to CCUS systems, yet more work will be required in order to improve model predictions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract\nTropical convection is often organized into clusters. But due to the insufficient understanding of the mechanisms behind, description of convective organization is still missing in GCMs, and it is even more challenging to represent its feedbacks on the convection development. To identify the favorable thermodynamical and dynamical large-scale environmental conditions for the convective organization, a 15-yr Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Feature (RPF) database is combined with ERA-Interim reanalysis. Based on sizes and maximum echo top heights, RPFs between 36°S-36°N are classified into shallow isolated, shallow organized, deep isolated and deep organized. Firstly, we show the global distribution of these four types of RPFs, and quantify their contribution to total precipitation. Secondly, in combination with the meteorological variables from the ERA-Interim, we differentiate the environmental properties favoring these four types of RPFs to understand what factors benefit the convective organization. A series of analyses show that moisture convergence at surface, mid-level (700-300hPa) moisture, low-level (1-3km) wind shear and upper level vertical velocity play important roles in clustering the convection. Organized systems occur more likely in the environment with stronger surface moisture convergence, higher mid level relative humidity and strong low-level wind shear. However, there are large regional and seasonal variations in the influences of these factors. Generally, systems are relatively easier to be organized over ocean than over land.",

            "abstract": "In the 10 years that Cassini has been orbiting Saturn, a wealth of observations have been returned that have probed a wide range of altitudes in Saturn's atmosphere from <1 microbar to roughly 3 bars. Radar and 5-micron VIMS images reveal spectacular cloud structure at the 3-bar level. ISS, CIRS, and VIMS probe the upper troposphere where storms originate. CIRS probes the stratosphere and upper troposphere, while UVIS sounds the stratosphere and mesosphere.\nSome of the highlights include: 1) the Great Northern Storm of 2010-2011. This planet-encircling storm is believed to have originated in the water cloud (P>10 bars) with dramatic effects on the cloud structure in the upper troposphere (0.5 bars), and, quite surprisingly, the generation of localized heated regions in Saturn's stratosphere near 2 mbars. Cassini's full instrument complement was used to study the storm, leading to the detection of fresh ammonia ice in the troposphere and enhanced temperatures and hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, in the stratosphere.\n2) The detection of hurricane-like features at both the North and South Pole of Saturn. These exhibit interesting structure at the spatial resolution of ISS and VIMS, while CIRS has detected enhanced temperatures at both poles.\n3) The persistence of the Northern Hexagon at 79N. This 6-sided feature was detected by Voyager and it has been studied by the full suite of Cassini remote sensing instruments. It is detectable as a warm region at 100 mbars, but there is no thermal signature in the stratosphere.\n4) Seasonal reversal of photochemically produced aerosols. When Cassini arrived at Saturn, the winter northern hemisphere appeared blue, while the southern hemisphere exhibited an orange appearance. Shortly after equinox in 2009, the appearance reversed quite abruptly.\nDuring the last stage of the mission in 2016-2017, Cassini will obtain measurements at very high spatial resolution during the F-ring and Proximal orbits. The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer will directly sample the upper atmosphere, while on other orbits, precise measurements of Saturn's gravity will provide valuable constraints to models of Saturn's interior.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has shown solitary waves to be capable of transporting fluids through porous media at rates orders of magnitude faster than predicted from Darcy’s law. Solitary waves are expressed as regions of high fluid pressure and porosity. The waves form and propagate where permeability is a sensitive function of effective stress, fluid pressure approaches lithostatic pressure, and the rate of fluid pressure generation is rapid compared to the rate of fluid pressure diffusion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the pressure generation rates that can develop in a sedimentary basin over a range of possible geologic conditions so that the potential for solitary wave formation can be assessed. Pressure generation rates were calculated for a generic sedimentary basin by constructing a two-dimensional numerical model that treated sediment deposition, compaction, heat flow, kerogen maturation, hydrocarbon formation, and the flow of water, oil, and gas. The results showed compaction disequilibrium and hydrocarbon formation to be the two principal causes of pressure generation, respectively. Pressure generation rates for typical sedimentary basinal conditions were found to be on the order of 1’s of Pa/year, up to a maximum of ~400 Pa/year under the most favorable pressure generating conditions. These pressure generation rates would be sufficient to form oil-saturated solitary waves but too low to form methane-saturated solitary waves because of the higher rate of methane pressure diffusion compared to oil, due to methane’s lower viscosity. To form methane-saturated solitary waves, pressure generation rates of at least ~1800 Pa/year are needed, which are unlikely to be produced by sedimentary basin diagenetic processes, but could possibly be produced by earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) was the Earth’s most recent icehouse climate prior to the Cenozoic. At present, it is generally accepted that the latitudinal gradient in climate conditions was similar to the present icehouse. High-latitude ice sheets occasionally advanced into the mid-latitudes and retreated once more, but the tropics were warmer or similar in climate to the tropics during the Plio-Pleistocene.\nRecently, this idea has been challenged by sedimentological evidence of glaciation and dry weathering in upland areas of the tropics as well as geochemical evidence for cold tropical oceans that is consistent with the sedimentological evidence. These observations challenge current qualitative and quantitative models of Late Paleozoic climate, implying tropical climate may have been up to 15 degrees Celsius colder than the present day at some point during the LPIA.\nHere we consider whether the disparity between evidence for equatorial cold in Pangaea and current models can be explained by explosive volcanic activity associated with events such as the Hercynian orogen or the Kennedy-Connors-Auburn Silicic Large Igneous Province.\nWe find that the necessary radiative forcing for glaciation in low-latitude upland areas could be generated by explosive volcanic activity one to two orders of magnitude greater than the present day, perturbing a baseline climate with mid-latitude glaciation in both hemispheres.\nSuch a forcing would have potentially significant impacts on the carbon cycle and ice sheet dynamics, but these effects are not likely to be unambiguously detectable in the record. Instead, we argue that measurements of mass independent fractionation of S in lacustrine sediments or other deposits sampling meteoric water would be the least ambiguous test of a hypothetical volcanic driver for late Paleozoic cold.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, EAR-1337463.",

            "abstract": "MESSENGER's orbital mission at Mercury led to the discovery of an unusual landform not known from other airless rocky bodies of the Solar System. Hollows are irregularly shaped, shallow, rimless depressions, often occurring in clusters and with high-reflectance interiors and halos. The fresh appearance of hollows suggests that they are relatively young features. For example, hollows are uncratered, and talus aprons downslope of hollows in certain cases appear to be covering small impact craters (100–200 in diameter). Hence, some hollows may be actively forming at present. The characteristics of hollows are suggestive of formation via destruction of a volatile-bearing phase (possibly one or more sulfides) through solar heating, micrometeoroid bombardment, and/or ion impact. Previous analysis showed that hollows are associated with low-reflectance material (LRM), a color unit identified from global color images. The material hosting hollows has often been excavated from depth by basin or crater impacts. Hollows are small features (tens of meters to several kilometers), so their detection and characterization with MESSENGER’s global maps have been limited. MESSENGER's low-altitude orbits provide opportunities for collection of images at high spatial resolutions, which reveal new occurrences of hollows and offer views of hollows with unprecedented detail. As of this writing, we have examined more than 21,000 images with pixel sizes <20 m and incidence angles <85°. Hollows were found in 559 images. Locations of the hollows (e.g., crater floor, rim, central peak, plains) were recorded. Shadow-length measurements were made on 280 images, yielding the depths of 1343 individual hollows. The mean depth is 30 m, with a standard deviation of 17 m. We also explored correlations between the geographic locations of hollows and maps provided by the MESSENGER geochemical sensors (X-Ray, Gamma-Ray, and Neutron Spectrometers), including the abundances of Al/Si, Ca/Si, Fe/Si, K, Mg/Si, and S/Si, as well as total neutron cross-section. No clear compositional trends emerged; it is likely that any true compositional preference for terrain that hosts hollows is obscured by the very large difference in scale between the resolution of the geochemical maps (hundreds of kilometers) and the dimensions of the hollows themselves.",

The framework is designed to support the analysis of high-dimensional inverse problems that have thousands of parameters and hundreds of thousands of observations.

These linear analysis equations are the most common and also the most applicable to large-scale environmental models.\nSeveral native python operators (such as multiplication, subtraction, addition, exponentiation) have been overloaded to make equation building more concise as well as to achieve speedup with operations involving diagonal matrices. To help ensure pyEMU is intuitive and easy to use, emphasis was placed on flexibility and concise object instantiation. As a result, several types of arguments can be handled elegantly.",

            "abstract": "The Tuvalu seamount chain is a Mid-Pacific (4-11oS, 175-179oE) linear volcanic chain that was previously poorly sampled. Absolute plate motion (APM) models predict a long-lived relationship with hotspot activity in French Polynesia. The lack of detailed age data therefore results in a key chronologic gap in the geologic history of this hotspot and current APM models. Depending on the set of assumptions employed, previous APM models have disagreed on which known hotspot chain, if any, the Tuvalu volcanoes are associated with. Based on APM modeling and geochemical affinities (HIMU, 206Pb/204Pb > 20), Konter et al. (2008) argue that Rurutu Island (French Polynesia) represents the modern location of the hotspot that contributed volcanism to the Tuvalu seamounts. This model traces the hotspot chain from Rurutu through the region of modern day Samoa, the Tuvalu seamounts, the Gilbert ridge, and into the North & South Wake islands. This hypothesis suggests that a single HIMU mantle reservoir can exist and remain relatively geochemically consistent over 100 Myrs. On the contrary, the Wessel and Kroenke (2008) APM model suggest the Tuvalu seamounts and N & S Wake are unrelated. This model requires the N & S Wake chains to rotate significantly at the young end of the Gilbert Ridge resulting in a current hotspot location around 13-15oS and 156-155oW, away from any known active volcanism. During the summer of 2013, 25 Tuvaluan seamounts and 9 seamounts near the current Samoan chain were dredged onboard the R.V. Roger Revelle (expedition RR1310). Here we present 43 new 40Ar-39Ar ages covering 19 Tuvaluan seamounts and four seamounts within the Samoan hotspot track. These ages provide insights into the contributing hotspot for Tuvaluan volcanism and provide a new reference frame for constraining Pacific APM models. The corresponding chemical analyses for a subset of these seamounts will be presented by Finlayson et al. (this volume).\nKonter, J. G. et al.

            "abstract": "Since the early Paleozoic, the average bulk δ13C value of marine carbonates has remained relatively positive varying between 0 and +4‰ with distinctive positive excursions that are associated with global changes in the carbon cycle. Unlike the Phanerozoic δ13C data for marine limestones, a major δ13C excursion has been recorded in a globally deposited Neoproterozoic marine dolomite formation, known as the cap dolostone. This excursion with δ13C values ranging systematically between -3 and -5‰ represents a global chronstratigraphic marker used to correlate the end of the major Marinoan glaciation at 636 Ma1. Does this excursion signify a primary seawater value and how might it be interpreted as a primary carbon cycle signal, considering the widespread distribution of the cap dolostone?\nStudies of modern dolomite precipitating environments, such as supratidal sabkhas of Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. and Qatar and coastal hypersaline lagoons of Rio de Janiero State, Brazil, indicate that microbial activity or the biological products, thereof, influence or mediate mineral formation. The precipitating solutions are sourced from normal seawater, which has experienced variable stages of concentration through evaporative processes. Comparison of δ13C values of sabkha dolomite with that formed in the hypersaline lagoons reveals that the former are always rather positive (approx. +2 to +7 ‰), whereas the latter are always negative (approx. -5‰ to -11‰). During very early diagenesis, the original δ13C value of the initial precipitate is not necessarily retained, indicating that synsedimentary processes can alter the carbon signal prior to burial and later diagenesis. However, the potential for very early lithification of microbial dolomite promotes the preservation of original δ13C values, which, thus, can be useful for evaluation of the ancient carbon cycle.\n1Halverson, G.P. et al., 2005.

(2013, Proc. SPIE 8867, doi:10.1117/12.2022668) was used to conduct the demonstration. An integrating sphere (IS), linear polarizers and quarter wave plate were used to confirm that the instrument’s spectral response to unpolarized light, to 45° linearly polarized light and to circular polarized light are identical. In all these cases the intensity components Ip = Is where Ip is the component parallel to the object space projected slit and Is is perpendicular to the slit. In the circular polarized case Ip = Is in the time averaged sense. The polarizer and IS were used to characterize the ratio Rθ of the instrument response to linearly polarized light at the angle θ relative to parallel from the slit, for increments of θ from 0 to 90°, to that of the unpolarized case. Spectra of diffusely reflected sunlight passed through the polarizer in increments of θ, and divided by the respective Rθ showed identical results, within the noise limit, for solar spectrum multiplied by the atmospheric transmission and convolved by the Instrument Line Shape (ILS). These measurements demonstrate that unknown polarization in the diffusely reflected sunlight on this small spectral range affect only the slow change across the narrow band in spectral response relative to that of unpolarized light and NOT the finely structured / high contrast spectral structure of the CO2 atmospheric absorption that is used to retrieve the atmospheric content of CO2. The latter is one of the geoCARB mission objectives (Kumer et al, 2013). The situation is similar for the other three narrow geoCARB bands; O2 A band 757.9 to 768.6 nm; strong CO2 band 2045.0 to 2085.0 nm; CH4 and CO region 2300.6 to 2345.6 nm. Polonsky et al have repeated the mission simulation study doi:10.5194/amt-7-959-2014 assuming no use of a geoCARB depolarizer or polarizer. Enabled by measurement of the geoCARB grating efficiencies the simulated intensities Ism include the slow polarization induced spectral change across the band. These Ism are input to the retrieval SW that was used in the original study. There is no significant change to the very positive previous results for the mission objective of gas column retrieval.",

Climate change and air pollution are two current environmental issues holding the public's attention which require collaboration of all stakeholders to create meaningful solutions. General education science courses are critical venues to engage students in the intersection of science with society. Effective teaching methods for these intersections include case studies, gallery walks, and town hall meetings. A case study from California explores how air quality has greatly improved in Los Angeles in the past 20 years, however residents of neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status are still exposed to high levels of air pollutants. Students analyze scientific and health data to develop understanding and expertise in the problem, and are then tasked with developing a cost-benefit analysis of solutions. Gallery walks can be used to connect natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and severe weather, with their human impacts. Students bring their personal experiences with disasters and recovery to analyze how societies should deal with the changing climate and weather risks in their region, the country, or across the world. Town hall meetings allow students to gain expertise and perspective while embodying a role as a particular stakeholder in a climate mitigation or adaptation issue. A successful application of this method is a discussion of whether a resort community should be rebuilt on a barrier island after being destroyed in a category 3 hurricane. Stakeholders which students take on as roles have included climate scientists, homeowners, emergency managers, meteorologists, and others.

The Decision Support Interface (DSI) seeks to integrate a number of remotely sensed and modeled variables to create a single, simplified portal for analysis of crop growing conditions. The DSI has been reformulated to incorporate more variables and give the user more freedom in exploring the available data. This refinement seeks to transition the DSI from a “first glance” agroclimatic indicator to one better suited for the differentiation of drought events.\nThe DSI performs analysis of variables over primary agricultural zones at the first sub-national administrative level. It uses the spatially averaged rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI), and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to identify potential hazards to food security. Presenting this information in a web-based client gives food security analysts and decision makers a lightweight portal for information on crop growing conditions in the region.\nThe crop zones used for the aggregation contain timing information which is critical to the DSI presentation. Rainfall and ETa are accumulated from different points in the crop phenology to identify season-long deficits in rainfall or transpiration that adversely affect the crop-growing conditions. Furthermore, the NDVI and WRSI serve as their own seasonal accumulated measures of growing conditions by capturing vegetation vigor or actual evapotranspiration deficits.\nThe DSI is currently active for major growing regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with intention of expanding to other areas over the coming years.",

            "abstract": "We simulate the vulnerability of all 35 Florida coastal counties to the ongoing Anthropocene marine transgression unconstrained by the artificial end date of year 2100. Coastal submergence was emulated using a ‘bathtub model’ and rising sea level associated with an atmospheric temperature increase of +1 oC to +4 oC (see Levermann et al. [1]).\nSimulation results are organized into seven regions, each representing an area of common vulnerability characterized in this study as high (9% to 30% land loss), higher (16 to 68% land loss) and highest (48% to 97% land loss). This grouping provides a logical basis for establishing or re-enforcing collaboration based upon a common threat and the utility of shared technical and financial resources.\nOur bathtub model assumes Florida terrain is simply submerged as the shoreline migrates across a static landscape without change in the physical and biological materials subject to marine transgression. However, geologic studies of past and present Florida shorelines indicate the rate of rise is as important as the magnitude when predicting coastal response. To determine the utility of the bathtub model as a representative simulation of Florida’s response to future sea level rise, we considered Florida’s coastal response to varying rates of sea level rise over the last 14,000 years. Available data clearly demonstrate predicted rates of sea level rise will result in widespread submergence; the rate of rise will be too fast to be offset by the stabilizing forces of biogenic or physical sediment accumulation. Hence the magnitude of land loss and associated shoreline retreat in each of the seven Florida regions – and likely other coastal zones in the southeast U.S. – will be solely a function of topographic elevation and can therefore be reasonably forecast using a bathtub model.\nWhile our focus is on Florida’s coastal counties, we recognize in some regions the effects of sea level rise will extend further inland. In these areas, the regional boundaries could be expanded to include adjacent non-coastal counties.

            "abstract": "A condition that initiates macropore flow at the land surface is the application of water faster than it can infiltrate into the soil matrix material. Sometimes this is taken to require ponding, but accumulated evidence shows preferential flow to be commonplace when wetness is less than saturation and when macropores are not completely filled. Examples include water flowing into shrinkage cracks or funneled into macropores by hydrophobic surface material. A more inclusive criterion is that macropore flow is generated when the water application rate exceeds the infiltrability of a small area associated with a macropore.\nA new model based on this criterion considers the representative elementary area (REA), as would be appropriate for measurement of field-scale infiltrability, to be divided into a mosaic of functional sub-areas (FSA). A single value of matrix infiltrability characterizes each FSA. The REA as a mosaic of FSAs is hydraulically represented by a characteristic distribution of infiltrabilities. During rainfall or irrigation, each FSA absorbs water into its soil matrix material up to the rate of its matrix infiltrability. Water applied in excess of this infiltrability is assumed to flow into a macropore within or adjacent to the FSA, becoming preferential flow. Especially if crusted or hydrophobic, an FSA can generate preferential flow even during low-intensity rainfall when other FSAs are absorbing all incident water into the matrix. The total flux of preferential flow at given depth is the sum of contributions from all FSAs. In this way the characteristic distribution of FSA infiltrabilities controls the field-scale partitioning of matrix and macropore flow as an emergent phenomenon.\nIllustrative case studies use field-measured data concerning water application rate and preferential flux. Results show this model can quantitatively represent observations of preferential flow occurring in relatively dry soils or at modest rainfall intensities.",

            "abstract": "Denudation and magmatism are distinct characteristics of Large Igneous Provinces, such as the Northwest Australian volcanic margin. Unfortunately, its temporal and spatial extent is poorly defined. Here, I present a simple isostatic model relating denudation to plume induced lithospheric thinning and underplating to delineate the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous Exmouth mantle plume. This upwelling was centered on a highly extended and subsided continental fragment known as the subsea Sonne/Sonja Ridge area and includes the Cuvier Margin (CM) and Cape Range Fracture Zone (CRFZ). The region is characterized by ~3 km denudation and ~ 500 m tectonic uplift, with erosion products acting as provenance for the Early Cretaceous Lower Barrow delta. Partial melting of the plume generated an underplate, characterized as a high velocity body (HVB) on seismic data. Denudation analysis indicates that only ~40 % of the HVB is melt related, with the effective underplate ~ 4 km thick at the plume centre, decreasing in the outer regions. Widespread plume induced convective lithospheric thinning set the boundary conditions for subsequent extension related magmatism and breakup in the Valanginian, as recorded by subsidence analysis of exploration wells. Hot plume derived material flowed to regions under extension, initiating additional magmatism now observed as SDRs (Seaward Dipping Reflectors series), initially thick magmatic crust, followed by normal ocean spreading in the Hauterivian. After initial upwelling, the thermal plume can be traced in a western direction as a hotspot to the Quokka Rise in the mid Cretaceous, before terminating after 35 – 50 Ma of activity. These findings suggest that most volcanic margins are generated by plume upwellings that are relatively passive features, with uplift consisting of a combination of plume induced convective lithospheric thinning and underplating. Melt migration and mantle heating subsequently lower stresses and facilitate breakup.",

Giovanni (Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) offers a variety of data summarization and visualization to users that operate at the data center, obviating the need for users to download and read the data themselves for exploratory data analysis. However, the NLDAS data has proven surprisingly resistant to application of the summarization algorithms. Algorithms that were perfectly happy analyzing 15 years of daily satellite data encountered limitations both at the algorithm and system level for 35 years of hourly data. Failures arose, sometimes unexpectedly, from command line overflows, memory overflows, internal buffer overflows, and time-outs, among others. These serve as an early warning sign for the problems likely to be encountered by the general user community as they try to scale up to “Big Data” analytics. Indeed, it is likely that more users will seek to perform remote web-based analysis precisely to avoid the issues, or the need to reprogram around them. We will discuss approaches to mitigating the limitations and the implications for data systems serving the user communities that try to scale up their current techniques to analyze Big Data.",

Our objective is to understand how variations in precipitation intensity and frequency, tectonic uplift rates, and topographic relief affect the magnitude and composition of organic matter deposited along this margin. To examine the possible tectonic and climatic factors influencing the land-ocean relationship of Cascadia during the late Holocene, we measured the organic carbon content, carbon-nitrogen ratio, stable isotopic compositions of organic carbon, yields of lignin-derived and lipid-derived constituents, and mineral surface area of collected sediments from box, kasten and piston cores. Decreases in several organic constituents revealed a potential preferential degradation of marine organic matter over time. Lignin phenol abundances oscillated downcore, pointing towards changes in the provenance of terrigenous organic matter transported to this site. Primary component analysis (PCA) illustrated distinct marine and terrestrial organic matter-dominated segments of the record, which will be correlated to eustatic, tectonic and climatic forcings over the late Holocene.",

Here, we explore the use of MBES data to estimate grain-scale roughness of submerged riverbed sediment. There are two broad approaches: 1) using digital elevation models constructed from depth soundings, and 2) using acoustic backscatter. We discuss the relative merits of both approaches using examples from data collected on the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons, Arizona, USA.\nThe primary advantage of acoustic backscatter over topography from soundings, for the purposes of sediment classification, is the potential to distinguish between sediment at a higher resolution. This is because soundings are point measurements, whereas a recorded backscatter magnitude is the integral of backscattered sound from all scatterers in the insonified area. In addition, this acoustic return contains information about both the roughness and the hardness/impedance of the sediment. The statistics of backscatter magnitudes alone are found to be a poor discriminator between sediment types perhaps because, using our 400 kHz system, the scattering regime changes from Rayleigh (sound scattering by particles smaller than the sound wavelength) for fine sand, to geometric (scattering by larger-than-sound-wavelength particles) for substrates coarser than sand. However, simple measures derived from backscatter power spectra (namely, the variance, integral lengthscale, and the intercept and slope from a power-law form - see Figure) are found to distinguish between patches of sand, gravel, cobbles and boulders. Using this dependence, we present a new data-driven approach to classify grain-scale roughness, developed by comparing the spectral properties of backscatter with bed-sediment observations using geo-referenced underwater video.",

            "abstract": "Climate-change impacts on species distributions will be especially complex in mountain systems with steep environmental gradients and heterogeneous landscapes. In the western US, projected climate conditions include rising temperatures, decreased snowpack, and increased moisture deficits, all of which will impact species distributions at high elevations. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis; WBP) is a keystone species in subalpine environments and one that is highly vulnerable to projected climate trends. In the past two decades, WBP populations dramatically declined as a result of bark beetle infestation, blister rust, high-severity fires, and drought. Species-niche modeling used to map future WPB distributions is based on the relation between present-day occurrence and bioclimatic parameters. While these models capture the realized niche, the full niche space inferred from paleo-observations appears to be much larger. To assess a broad range of bioclimatic conditions for WPB, we examined its response to past changes in climate, fire activity, and species competition. General additive modeling of pollen/charcoal data from the Greater Yellowstone area indicate that WBP reached maximum population size and distribution ~12,000 -7500 years ago and declined thereafter. Population dynamics tracked variations in summer insolation, such that WBP was most abundant when summer temperatures and fire frequency were higher than at present. Competition from lodgepole pine after ~10,000 years ago limited WBP at middle elevations. Paleoecological data indicate that the fundamental WBP niche is considerably larger than assumed, and simulations that project the demise of WBP in the next 50 years are probably too dramatic given WPB’s ability to thrive under warm conditions and high fire activity in the past. Management strategies that reduce biotic competition and nonnative pathogens should help increase the future resilience of WBP and other subalpine species.",

The Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometers onboard Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity discovered a variety of primary and secondary phosphate phases allowing direct comparisons across the three landing sites. The Spirit rover at Gusev Crater encountered the “Wishstone/Watchtower” class of P-rich (up to 5.2 wt% P2O5) rocks interpreted to be alkaline volcanic rocks with a physical admixture of ~10 to 20% merrillite [Usui et al 2008]. These rocks are characterized by elevated Ti and Y and anomalously low Cr and Ni, which could largely reflect the nature of the protoliths: Evolved magmatic rocks. Many of these chemical signatures are also found in pyroclastic deposits at nearby “Home Plate” and in phosphate precipitates derived from fluid interactions with these rocks (“Paso Robles” soils). The Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum recently analyzed a ~4 cm clast in a fine-grained matrix, one of numerous rocks of similar appearance at the rim of Endeavour Crater. This clast, “Sarcobatus,” has minor enrichments in Ca and P relative to the matrix, and like the P-rich rocks at Gusev, Sarcobatus also shows elevated Al and Ti. On the same segment of the Endeavour rim, subsurface samples were found with exceptional levels of Mn (~3.5 wt% MnO). These secondary and likely aqueous deposits contain strong evidence for associated Mg-sulfate and Ca-phosphate phases. Finally, the Curiosity traverse at Gale crater encountered P-rich rocks compositionally comparable to Wishstone at Gusev, including elevated Y. Phosphorous-rich rocks with similar chemical characteristics are prevalent on Mars, and the trace and minor element signatures provide constraints on whether these are primary deposits, secondary products of physical weathering, or secondary products of chemical weathering.",

Physico-chemical parameters like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total dissolved solids, salinity and redox potential. Collection of samples was done during the peak season in April 2013.

The bioavailable metal concentrations indicate that enrichment of Pb, Cd, Cr and As and it is also supported by the higher values observed from the calculation of enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index. The higher values in the sediments is either due to natural sources like chemical weathering of rocks and external sources, which points to high tourism, agricultural activities in the region. Identification of micro-plastics was done through SEM photographs, indicating the type of plastic wastes deposited into the beach regions which can indicate the density, durability and the persistence level in the sediments.

            "abstract": "In Saturn's magnetosphere, periodic fluctuations are observed in Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), auroral emissions, magnetic field, electron density, and energetic particle fluxes. We have extended previous Cassini investigations at Saturn by characterizing periodicities in additional plasma and magnetic field properties in Saturn's middle magnetosphere near the equatorial plane. It is customary to model perturbations in the middle magnetosphere as if they rotate rigidly, but we find that this assumption does not work well for all properties of interest and that the phase dependence of the perturbations may vary with radius and local time. We use a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation [Jia et al., 2012], which generates a rotating pattern of field aligned currents centered at 70° invariant latitude in Saturn's southern ionosphere that impose periodic variations on the entire magnetosphere, to understand how the changing size and shape affects the observed properties. In particular, we find that the dayside magnetopause roughly follows the 80 invariant latitude field lines as they move in and out. We identify three different modes of magnetospheric periodicity linked to rotation (spinning), compression (breathing), and north-south motion (flapping). All have the same ~10.7 hour period, but impose significant changes at phases that depend on the plasma property considered and the location of the measurement. Multiple modes acting concurrently can produce distinctly non-sinusoidal waveforms of the variations of plasma parameters through a rotation cycle. Within limitations of data coverage, we find good agreement between the simulation and the data in the rotation phase modulation of magnetic pressure, plasma pressure, and density perturbations.",

            "abstract": "Sediment particle motions on steepland hillslopes often are patchy, intermittent and rarefied. Such motions include particle skittering from rockfall, particle ravel, downslope dispersal of soil material due to tree throw and the activity of fossorial animals, soil slips, and transport by surface flows, particularly following fire. We may envision these as motions that start from the soil surface and then return to it after some finite time. Travel distances can be much larger than the soil thickness. Unless explicitly treated at the transport 'event' scale, the discontinuous qualities of these sediment motions in steeplands are at odds with continuum formulations of the sediment flux and the Exner equation of conservation as normally envisioned. The necessary averaging volumes and timescales are too large. Alternatively, the entrainment form of the Exner equation, when cast in probabilistic terms, provides a framework for describing the averaged effects of patchy, intermittent motions on the land surface. The formulation is mass conserving, \"nonlocal\" and scale independent, and it therefore does not require an averaging volume. However, there is a tradeoff. One must specify, based on theory or measurements, an ensemble distribution of particle travel distances that is to be considered a signature of the operative transport processes and extant hillslope conditions. Transport events (specifically, sediment travel distances) occurring over a specified interval of time represent \"samples\" drawn from this ensemble distribution. Predictions of changes in land-surface elevation are then statistically expected values, with associated uncertainty that depends on the frequency of transport. A growing set of field-based and high-resolution DEM measurements suggests that the nonlocal formulation is consistent with observed (one-dimensional) hillslope profiles in steeplands. We are extending the formulation to two-dimensional topography; initial results suggest a rich behavior that is unlike that predicted by local formulations of transport. Because of its general, scale-independent form, the basic formulation is virtually identical to the entrainment form of the Exner equation used in describing bed load sediment transport.",

Recent insights on the plant uptake of atmospheric COS suggest that plant uptake is the largest component of the global COS budget and that COS may provide a powerful new tool for partitioning sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 at regional to global scales. However, alternative sources and sinks of COS must also be accounted for to minimize the uncertainty of this carbon cycle tracer approach. Here we focus on direct and indirect sources of atmospheric COS from anthropogenic activities. We construct bottom-up gridded inventories of anthropogenic COS sources and compare these to previous estimates that were based on relatively sparse emissions data. Furthermore, we simulate COS concentrations with an regional atmospheric chemistry model to show the influence of these alternative source estimates in relation to plant uptake at a range of surface and airborne monitoring sites.

IceBridge data reveal a ~1500 m deep, ~1000 km long bedrock trough under the main trunk of Recovery Ice Stream. We extend the lake activity time series to 2012 for the three lower lakes using IceBridge data: one lake underwent a large deflation between 2009 and 2011; another lake, which had been continuously filling between 2003 and 2010, started to drain after 2011. Hydrologic connections among the lakes appear to be direct and responsive. We reproduce the lake activity using a simple subglacial water model. The hydrologic system beneath Recovery Ice Stream is controlled by unusually pronounced bedrock topography (and not ice surface topography, as is the case for most Antarctic systems studied to date).

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 350 was the first in the rear part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana intra-oceanic arc. The morphology of the Izu rear arc is dominated by a series of ~16 – 3 Ma basaltic to rhyolitic seamount chains up to ~50 km long, which strike at a high angle to the arc front, and differ from arc front rocks by being more similar to averaged continental crust (i.e. enriched in alkalis, Ba, Th, U and LREE). Site U1437 lies at 2117 mbsl in a ~20 km-wide volcano-bounded basin between the Manji and Enpo rear arc seamount chains, ~90 km west of the arc front.\nSite U1437 was drilled to 1804 mbsf. The section is much more mud-rich than expected, with ~60% tuffaceous mud for the section as a whole, 89% in the uppermost 433 m, and high sedimentation rates of 100-260 m/my for the upper 1300 m. The proportion (40%) and grain size of tephra are much smaller than expected for an intra-arc basin, composed half of ash/tuff, and half of lapilli tuff of fine grain size. These were deposited by suspension settling through water and from density currents, in relatively distal settings. Volcanic blocks are only sparsely scattered through the lowermost 25% of the section (1320 to 1804 mbsf), which includes hyaloclastite, in situ quench-fragmented blocks, and a rhyolite peperite intrusion (i.e., proximal deposits). The lowest biostratigraphic datum is ~6.5 Ma at 867 mbsf; the lowest paleomagnetic datum ~9 Ma is at ~1300 mbsf; nannofossils at ~1400 mbsf indicate a range of 10.97–11.85 Ma; and rhyolite peperite at ~1390 mbsf has yielded a preliminary U-Pb zircon concordia intercept age of 13.6 +1.6/-1.7 Ma. Alteration resulted in destruction of fresh glass below ~750 mbsf, but minerals are less altered. Our preliminary interpretation is that arc front vs. rear arc sources can be distinguished in the upper (relatively distal) 1320 m, while the lower (proximal) 25% of the section may be heterogeneous, suggesting that the rear arc magmas only fully compositionally diverged after ca. 13 Ma.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of repeat-pass satellite-based surface altimetry over much of Antarctica, approximately 130 new subglacial lakes have been discovered entirely from observations of surface uplift and subsidence; these are commonly referred to as “active lakes”. In contrast to the ~160 lakes detected by radar sounding (“RES” lakes), which are typically in mountains bedrock terrain near the ice divide and static with residence times spanning millenia, active lakes are typically located in fast flowing ice streams far from the divides, and have short residence times. To understand how water transfers through active lake systems we have developed a new model based on earlier theoretical work and informed by lake-volume estimates inferred from of ice surface displacements detected by satellite radar and laser altimetry. We find that although the overall pattern of filling and drainage is similar to that for ice dammed lakes in alpine regions via channels thermally eroded into the ice that then creeps shut as water pressure declines, Antarctic lake drainage is better simulated by invoking a channel mechanically eroded into the underlying sediment. The necessity of an erodable deformable substrate to explain lake drainage suggests that the distribution of active lakes is an indicator for the presence of sediment. Furthermore the process of lake drainage appears quite sensitive to the composion and strength of the underlying till. We explore these possibilities by testing the model on subglacial lakes in both East and West Antarctica, including Recovery Glacier and MacAyeal Ice stream.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between a mantle plume and a subducting plate depends on 1) the relative position of the plume relative to the subducting plate, and 2) the relative \"strength\" of the slab compared to that of the plume. To study such an interaction, we are using three-dimensional laboratory models of a compositional plume within the vicinity of an entirely dynamically driven but fixed slab. We introduced a dimensionless number to calibrate the relative \"strength\" of the slab compared to that of the plume that is the ratio of the buoyancy flux of the slab by that of the plume. Here we describe the style of the interaction for three positions of the plume relative to the fixed slab, and for a plume buoyancy flux that was fixed and chosen to be about 20 times lower than the slab’s flux. In nature, this would be equivalent to consider a subducting plate of relatively narrow width (1000 km) and moderate buoyancy flux (20000 kg/s. e.g. Manila slab) impacting on the geometry and dynamics of a mantle plume of modest buoyancy flux (1000 kg/s. e.g. Canary plume). Under these conditions, we show that 1) rising plumes can be dragged either away or towards a slab in rollback motion by the mantle return flow, 2) the plume motion can vary from slight deflection to rotation, and 3) significant flattening of the plume can occur. Yet, no extreme impact of subducting plates on plumes is to be observed. To this end, the slab/plume buoyancy flux ratio needs to vary. For instance, in the case of plumes initiated at the apex of the slab tip and at a larger slab/plume buoyancy flux ratio, a plume head can detach from its conduit. Conversely, for the same initial slab/plume geometry but at a smaller slab/plume buoyancy flux ratio, a front plume head can be dragged down into subduction. The question that remains to be answered is at which buoyancy flux ratios occur the transitions from head detachment to \"simply\" head sucked towards the trench to head plume being subducted. This is currently being studied in our laboratory.",

Although an instrument can be designed to measure the surface salinity, a global scale measurement is currently not available. A regional model can be configured to have a vertical grid in centimeters, but it would be computationally prohibited on a global scale due to time step constraints. Here, we propose an extended surface salinity layer (ESSL) within a global ocean circulation model to diagnose skin SSS without increasing the computational cost, while allowing comparable solutions with both satellite and Argo salinity at the respective depths within the corresponding uncertainty limits. Cross-comparisons with Aquarius and Argo data show that the gridded Aquarius surface salinity has a much stronger seasonal variability than the gridded Argo top-level salinity at 5 m or 10 m, particularly in regions of high precipitation variability, suggesting strong near-surface vertical salinity stratification. The near-surface stratification is well reproduced by the proposed ESSL model. In comparisons with data-assimilated HYCOM results, the ESSL provides much stronger seasonal variability of SSS, similar to the Aquarius observations. The ESS also provides a useful reference for the global mean SSS to constrain the global calibration constants in Aquarius SSS retrieval.",

Notably, convective injection of copious amounts of water vapor into the lower stratosphere has direct and significant impacts on the radiation budget and consequently, climate. In this study, the sensitivity of cross-tropopause transport and UTLS structure in extratropical convection to the choice of numerical model resolution in simulations of explicitly-resolved convection (i.e., no convective parameterization) is examined. For an observed case of overshooting convection, the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model is run for all possible combinations of three horizontal (3-km,1-km,333-m) and vertical (600-m,300-m,150-m) resolutions. Although the model is successful in simulating overshooting convection and cross-tropopause transport in each case, the depth and magnitude of troposphere-to-stratosphere transport is found to decrease with refinement in the vertical dimension and increase with refinement in the horizontal dimension. In addition, modifications to the altitude of the tropopause and the simulated depth of the convective storms show important sensitivities. Notably, the accuracy in the depth of the simulated storm is primarily dependent on vertical resolution. Recommendations for future modeling studies of extratropical convection and cross-tropopause transport will be given.",

This research seeks to elucidate an understanding of autogenic and allogenic signatures on stratigraphy through morphodynamic modeling of aggradation and avulsions of the Brazos River in conjunction with climate and sea level changes throughout Holocene time. Backwater length scales are hypothesized to propel autogenic responses of the Brazos system by dictating the loci of aggradation, which back-step and fill the valley as sea level rises. The backwater length scale and sea level covary, thus inducing an intrinsic, but historically complex, relationship between autogenic and allogenic processes that is sought to be discerned using the morphodynamic model presented herein. We simulate Brazos fluvial evolution via changes in fluid flow, sediment transport, and bed topography under the influence of allogenic perturbations. The results are used to characterize and quantify the stratigraphic evolution of the Brazos incised valley fill and are readily comparable to numerous previous studies of the system. The infill model is informed by grain size data collected from modern deposits and by modern channel dimensions. This research attempts to link rising Holocene sea level with a backwater length scale which coincides with the extent of back-stepping aggradation within the Brazos incised valley. Modeling responses to perturbations of the Brazos fluvial system can be applied, more holistically, to predict future coastal dynamics and to inform interpretations of paleo-fluvial systems and hydrocarbon reservoirs.",

As a result, the water exiting dams is relatively free of sediment and the river flow is well below the transport capacity for bed-material. Because of this, rivers flowing downstream from dams tend to erode into their beds. This occurrence is well documented in gravel-bed rivers, but has not been as completely studied in sand-bed channels, such as the lower Trinity River, Texas. Sediment mining from the bed of a gravel river acts to coarsen the surface layer until the armoring shuts off any further bed erosion. This armoring control on the sediment discharge is not effective in a sand bed river. The abundant supply of sediment in a sand bed alluvial river results in a unique response: the river bed is scoured until sediment transport capacity is reached. In the lower Trinity River the consequences of this scouring and bed-sediment mining are channel bed lowering, channel wall steepening, and reduced rates of lateral migration, as well as bed-sediment coarsening and deflation in the total volume of sediment constituting bars. The process of bed incision produces a convex long profile for the river segment influenced by the dam. After 40 years of impoundment the channel immediately downstream of the dam has incised five to seven meters and dam-influenced adjustments to the geomorphology of the river are observed for 50 to 60 river kilometers downstream. The channel downstream of this zone appears unaffected by the dam. Over time the river bed continues to erode and the zone of dam influence expands downstream. In this paper we present a one-dimensional morphodynamic model that estimates the adjustment in channel profile elevation through time due to the dam’s retention of sediment. Model output matches the field measurements of physical changes to the river channel. Results of the model and physical observations explain the sediment transport dynamics associated with the lower Trinity River downstream of Livingston Dam.",

            "abstract": "Cassini’s findings have revolutionized our understanding of Saturn, its complex rings, the amazing assortment of moons and the planet’s dynamic magnetic environment. The robotic spacecraft arrived in 2004 after a 7-year flight from Earth, dropped a parachuted probe named Huygens to study the atmosphere and surface of Saturn’s big moon Titan, and commenced making astonishing discoveries that continue today. Icy jets shoot from the tiny moon Enceladus; Titan’s hydrocarbon lakes and seas are dominated by liquid ethane and methane, and complex pre-biotic chemicals form in the atmosphere and rain to the surface; 3-dimensional structures rise above Saturn’s rings, and a giant Saturn storm circled the entire planet. Cassini’s findings at Saturn have also fundamentally altered many of our concepts of how planets form around stars.\nThe Solstice Mission continues to provide fundamental new science as Cassini observes seasonal and temporal changes, and addresses new questions that have arisen during the mission thus far. The mission’s grand finale occurs in 2017, with 22 inclined orbits between the innermost D ring and the upper portions of Saturn’s atmosphere, enabling unique gravity and magnetic field measurements of the planet, unprecedented determination of the ring mass, some of the highest resolution measurements of the rings and Saturn, and in situ observations in a completely new region around the planet. Highlights from 10 years of Cassini’s ambitious inquiry at Saturn will be presented along with the remarkable science that will be collected in the next three years.\nCassini-Huygens is a cooperative undertaking by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian space agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, ASI).\nThis work was carried out in part at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.

            "abstract": "The joint security of water, food, and energy systems is an urgent issue everywhere, and strong drivers of development and land use change, exacerbated by climate change, require new knowledge to achieve integrated solution using a nexus-based approach to assess inter-dependencies. Effective research-based decision support tools are essential to identify the major issues and interconnections to help in implementation of the nexus approach. The major needs are models and data to clearly and unambiguously present decision scenarios to local cooperative groups of farmers, electric energy generators and water officials for joint decisions. These can be developed by integrated models to link hydrology, land use, energy use, cropping simulation, and optimization with economic objectives and socio-physical constraints. The first step in modeling is to have a good conceptual model and then to get data. As the linking of models increases uncertainties, each one should be supplied with adequate data at suitable spatial and temporal resolutions. Most models are supplied with data by geophysical scientists, such as hydrologists, geologists, atmospheric scientists, soil scientists, and climatologists, among others. Outcomes of a recently-completed project to study the water-energy-food nexus will be explained to illuminate the model and data needs to inform future management actions across the nexus. The project included a workshop of experts from government, business, academia, and the non-profit sector who met to define and explain nexus interactions and needs. An example of the findings is that data inconsistencies among sectors create barriers to integrated planning. A nexus-based systems model is needed to outline sectoral inter-dependencies and identify data demands and gaps. Geophysical scientists can help to create this model and take leadership on designing data systems to facilitate sharing and enable integrated management.",

            "abstract": "Rift evolution and passive margin formation has been thoroughly investigated using conceptual and numerical models in two dimensions. However, the 2D assumption that the extension direction is perpendicular to the rift trend is often invalid. In fact, the majority of rift systems that lead to continental break-up during the last 150 My involved moderate to high rift obliquity. Yet, the degree to which oblique lithospheric extension affects first-order rift and passive margin properties like surface stress pattern, fault azimuths, and basin geometry, is still not entirely clear.\nThis contribution provides insight in crustal stress patterns and fault orientations by applying a 3D numerical rift model to oblique extensional settings. The presented forward experiments cover the whole spectrum of oblique extension (i.e. rift-orthogonal extension, low obliquity, high obliquity, strike-slip deformation) from initial deformation to breakup. They are conducted using an elasto-visco-plastic finite element model and involve crustal and mantle layers accounting for self-consistent necking of the lithosphere.\nEven though the model setup is very simple (horizontally layered, no inherited faults), its evolution exhibits a variety of fault orientations that are solely caused by the interaction of far-field stresses with rift-intrinsic buoyancy and strength. Depending on rift obliquity, these orientations involve rift-parallel, extension-orthogonal, and intermediate normal fault directions as well as strike-slip faults. Allowing new insights on fault patterns of the proximal and distal margins, the model shows that individual fault populations are activated in a characteristic multi-phase evolution driven by lateral density variations of the evolving rift system. Model results are in very good agreement with inferences from the well-studied Gulf of Aden and provide testable predictions for other rifts and passive margins worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Current Pacific absolute plate motion (APM) models include 2 major, long-lived hotspot tracks: the ~85 Ma Hawaiian-Emperor and the ~76 Ma Louisville tracks. Prior to ~50 Ma, these two hotspot tracks show significant inter-hotspot drift, mainly due to large southern motion of the Hawaiian hotspot [1,2]. A third track would allow for a more robust evaluation of the relationship between APM models and inter-hotspot drift.\nWe present trace element and Pb isotope evidence for a potential third long-lived Pacific hotspot trail—the Rurutu hotspot—anchored in the Cook-Austral Islands. Based on high 206Pb/204Pb ratios, 70-55 Ma volcanism in the Gilbert Ridge has been linked to the Rurutu hotspot [3]. The Gilbert Ridge may continue south into the Tuvalu Islands, where APM models predict that the Rurutu hotspot track captures the change in Pacific plate motion around 50 Ma at the intersection of Tuvalu and Samoa.\nSampling of the deep submarine flanks of atolls and seamounts in Tuvalu and westernmost Samoa took place during the 2013 RR1310 (R/V Roger Revelle) expedition. We present new Pb isotope and HFSE trace element data on 28 samples that support a Rurutu origin for Tuvalu volcanism and confirm HIMU signatures previously observed in 5 Tuvalu samples (206Pb/204Pb >20.1, several >21.0; 87Sr/86Sr < 0.705). Statistical tests indicate that Tuvalu HFSE element ratios show similarities with Cook-Austral HIMU and differences with Samoa EMII volcanism. Low Hf/Nb ratios are often a predictor of HIMU samples (206Pb/204Pb > 20.8). Moderately HIMU compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 20.0) correspond to slightly higher Hf/Nb. In an effort to test if compositional agreement with the Cook-Australs is reflected in an age progression, 40Ar/39Ar ages will be presented by Konrad et al.

These launches were supported by concurrent co-located continuous ground level ozone measurements at Saint Louis University’s St. Louis Ozone Garden. During the operation of this site, wildfires from both Idaho’s Beaver Creek (~115K acres) and California’s RIM fire (~258k acres) generated copious amounts of pollution. In addition, widespread agricultural fires in the Midwest were also taking place. To interpret our observations over St. Louis, we used multiple satellite-derived products and retrievals in conjunction with trajectory calculations from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. We examined a blocking high pressure event [Aug 26-30] which led to ozonesonde profile changes resulting from Stratospheric-Troposphere Exchange (STE) in addition to the smoke from the fires. This case study involved two mixed layer O3 enhancements, which could be spotted at multiple sites within the SEACIONS ozonesonde network. Our findings illustrate how satellite measurements can be used to assess the contribution of the transport of pollution from various sources to local air quality.",

            "abstract": "Lithifying microbial communities (“microbialites”) have left their signature on Earth’s rock record for over 3.4 billion years and are regarded as important players in paleo-biogeochemical cycles. In this project, we study extant microbialites to understand the interactions between lithification and resource availability. All microbes need nutrients and energy for growth; indeed, nutrients are often a factor limiting microbial growth. We hypothesize that calcium carbonate deposition can sequester bioavailable phosphorus (P) and expect the growth of microbialites to be P-limited. To test our hypothesis, we first compared nutrient limitation in lithifying and non-lithifying microbial communities in Río Mesquites, Cuatro Ciénegas. Then, we experimentally manipulated calcification rates in the Río Mesquites microbialites. Our results suggest that lithifying microbialites are indeed P-limited, while non-lithifying, benthic microbial communities tend towards co-limitation by nitrogen (N) and P. Indeed, in microbialites, photosynthesis and aerobic respiration responded positively to P additions (P<0.05). Organic carbon (OC) additions caused shifts in bacterial community composition based on analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Unexpectedly, calcification rates increased with OC additions (P<0.05), but not with P additions, suggesting that sulfate reduction may be an important pathway for calcification. Experimental reductions in calcification rates caused changes to microbial biomass OC and P concentrations (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively), although shifts depended on whether calcification was decreased abiotically or biotically. These results show that resource availability does influence microbialite formation and that lithification may promote phosphorus limitation; however, further investigation is required to understand the mechanism by which the later occurs.",

            "abstract": "Extraterrestrial life in our Solar System, if present, is almost certain to be microbial. Methods and technologies for unambiguous detection of living or extinct microorganisms are needed for life-detection missions to the Jovian and Saturnian moons, where liquid water is known to exist. Our research focuses specifically on microbial meaningful motion as a biosignature—“waving crowds” at the micron scale. Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) is an excellent tool for unambiguous identification of bacterial and protozoal swimming, even in the presence of turbidity, drift, and currents. The design of a holographic instrument with bacteria scale resolution was described in the previous talk. In this presentation, we will illustrate the design challenges for construction of a field instrument for extreme environments and space, and present plans for scientific investigations at analogue sites for the coming season.\nThe challenges of creating a field instrument involve performance trade-offs, the ability to operate at extreme temperatures, and handling large volumes of data. A fully autonomous instrument without external cables or power is also desirable, and this is something that previous holographic instruments have not achieved. The primary issues for space exploration are identification of a laser and drive electronics that are qualified for the expected radiation environments of the moons around gas giant planets.\nTests in Earth analogue environments will establish performance parameters as well as answer scientific questions that traditional microscopic techniques cannot. Specifically, we will visit a Greenland field site to determine whether or not microorganisms are motile within the brine-filled interior network of sea ice, and if they can be autonomously tracked using the instrument. Motility within the liquid phase of a frozen matrix has been hypothesized to explain how bacteria contribute to the biogeochemical signatures detected in ice, but observational evidence of motility in natural samples at subzero temperatures does not exist. Complementing tests for bacterial motility in ice-brines, we will also test for motility in the subzero waters directly beneath the ice, where motility has long been suspected but also never observed.",

            "abstract": "We describe new geological observations and geochemical data on tectono-sedimentary breccias that formed in hyper-extended domains of the Tethyan rift system. Such breccias are markers of detachment faults in the magma-poor Iberia-Newfoundland and Tethyan rifted margins and document the continuous exhumation of fault surfaces on the seafloor. We focus on a rift-related detachment fault in the most distal Adriatic rifted margin exposed at the interface between the Margna and Malenco nappes in the Eastern Central Alps of SE-Switzerland. These are the first syn-rift breccias along the Jurassic rift related detachment system that document a mixture of both continental and mantle-derived clasts, indicating that hyperextension and the formation of mantle windows are intimately coupled.\n3D mapping of the breccia combined with a 75m long drill core through the hanging and footwall of a detachment fault provide clear evidence that mantle exhumation and breccia formation was coeval. Downhole variations of major and trace elements, and ∂18O isotopes demonstrate m-scale extensive chemical exchange between crustal and mantle rocks.\nThe breccia-mantle contact is made of a m-wide fine-grained metasomatic chl±amph-bearing zone. The breccias on top of the ultramafic rocks are made of mm- to cm-sized amphibole-bearing mantle-derived clasts, continental-derived rounded to elongated cm- to meter-sized blocks, and a fine- to coarse-grained foliated matrix, dominated by chl+bt+fsp+qtz. Amphibole in amphibole-bearing clasts are Cr-Ni-rich, supporting the hypothesis of ultramafic clasts in the polymict breccia. Bulk rock major, minor and trace element data from the serpentinized peridotites to the continental-block bearing breccias show an increase in Al, Ca and elevated LREE. However, amphibole-rich clasts within the mica-rich matrix are very similar in composition to serpentinized peridotites with high Cr, Ni and low LREE, indicating that amphibole rich rocks are previous serpentinized peridotite clasts that are altered to form amphibole blackwalls, presumably related to recrystallization during Alpine metamorphism.

The NSF-GeoPRISMS Mini-lesson Project, funded by NSF-TUES, is designed to integrate fundamental results from the MARGINS program into open-source college-level curriculum. Three Subduction Factory (SubFac) mini-lessons were developed as part of this project. These include hands-on examinations of data sets representing 3 key components of the subduction zone system: 1) Heat transfer in the subducted slab; 2) Metamorphic processes happening at the plate interface; and 3) Typical magmatic products of arc systems above subduction zones.\nModule 1: “Slab Temperatures Control Melting in Subduction Zones, What Controls Slab Temperature?” allows students to work in groups using beads rolling down slopes as an analog for the mathematics of heat flow. Using this hands-on, exploration-based approach, students develop an intuition for the mathematics of heatflow and learn about heat conduction and advection in the subduction zone environment.\nModule 2: “Subduction zone metamorphism” introduces students to the metamorphic rocks that form as the subducted slab descends and the mineral reactions that characterize subduction-related metamorphism. This module includes a suite of metamorphic rocks available for instructors to use in a lab, and exercises in which students compare pressure-temperature estimates obtained from metamorphic rocks to predictions from thermal models.\nModule 3: “Central American Arc Volcanoes, Petrology and Geochemistry” introduces students to basic concepts in igneous petrology using the Central American volcanic arc, a MARGINS Subduction Factory focus site, as an example. The module relates data from two different volcanoes – basaltic Cerro Negro (Nicaragua) and andesitic Ilopango (El Salvador) including hand sample observations and major element geochemistry – to explore processes of mantle and crustal melting and differentiation in arc volcanism.",

We then developed a physically-based model of the cover fraction as a function of the bedrock relative roughness (bedrock hydraulic-roughness over grain size), and tested the sensitivity of the model to changes in bedrock relative roughness and sediment supply.\nThe analytical results show that: 1) the cover fraction is smaller when the bedrock relative roughness is smaller; 2) when bedrock roughness is larger than alluvial roughness (clast-rough bedrock), the cover fraction gradually increases with sediment supply; 3) when bedrock roughness is smaller than alluvial roughness (clast-smooth bedrock), a fully exposed bedrock channel requires a relatively large sediment supply before any alluvial patch is formed, and as supply increases, rapidly transitions to a fully alluvial channel; 4) in the case of clast-smooth bedrock, the transition between a fully exposed bedrock channel and a fully alluvial channel has hysteresis.",

            "abstract": "The work had been funded by NASA HQ's office of Cryospheric Sciences Program.\nRecent observations of the Arctic have shown that sea ice has diminished drastically, consequently impacting the environment in the Arctic and beyond. Certain factors such as atmospheric anomalies, wind forces, temperature increase, and change in the distribution of cold and warm waters contribute to the sea ice reduction. However current measurement capabilities lack the accuracy, temporal sampling, and spatial coverage required to effectively quantify each contributing factor and to identify other missing factors. Addressing the need for new measurement capabilities for the new Arctic regime, we propose a game-changing in-situ Arctic-wide Distributed Mobile Monitoring system called Moball-buoy Network. Moball-buoy Network consists of a number of wind-propelled self-powered inflatable spheres referred to as Moball-buoys. The Moball-buoys are self-powered. They use their novel mechanical control and energy harvesting system to use the abundance of wind in the Arctic for their controlled mobility and energy harvesting. They are equipped with an array of low-power low-mass sensors and micro devices able to measure a wide range of environmental factors such as the ice conditions, chemical species wind vector patterns, cloud coverage, air temperature and pressure, electromagnetic fields, surface and subsurface water conditions, short- and long-wave radiations, bathymetry, and anthropogenic factors such as pollutions. The stop-and-go motion capability, using their novel mechanics, and the heads up cooperation control strategy at the core of the proposed distributed system enable the sensor network to be reconfigured dynamically according to the priority of the parameters to be monitored. The large number of Moball-buoys with their ground-based, sea-based, satellite and peer-to-peer communication capabilities would constitute a wireless mesh network that provides an interface for a global control system. This control system will ensure arctic-wide coverage, will optimize Moball-buoys monitoring efforts according to their available resources and the priority of local areas of high scientific value within the Arctic region. Moball-buoy Network is expected to be the first robust and persistent Arctic-wide environment monitoring system capable of providing reliable readings in near real time",

            "abstract": "As development proceeds in the high latitudes, information about interactions between urban influences and the thickness of the active layer above permafrost becomes vital, particularly given the possibility of increasing temperatures accompanying climate change. Permafrost characteristics are often mapped at small geographical scales (i.e., over large areas), at low resolution, and without extensive field validation. Although maps of active-layer thickness (ALT) have been created for areas of relatively undisturbed terrain, this has rarely been done within urbanized areas, even though ALT is a critical factor in the design of roads, buildings, pipelines, and other elements of infrastructure. The need for detailed maps of ALT is emphasized in work on potential hazards in permafrost regions associated with global warming scenarios. \nNorthern Alaska is a region considered to be at moderate to high risk for thaw-induced damage under climatic warming. The Native Village of Barrow (71°17’44”N; 156°45’ 59”W), the economic, transportation, and administrative hub of the North Slope Borough, is the northernmost community in the USA, and the largest native settlement in the circum-Arctic. A winter urban heat island in Barrow, earlier snowmelt in the village, and dust deposition downwind of gravel pads and roads are all urban effects that could increase ALT. A recent empirical study documented a 17 to 41 cm difference in ALT between locations in the village of Barrow and surrounding undeveloped tundra, even in similar land-cover classes.\nWe mapped ALT in the Barrow Peninsula, with particular attention to contrasts between the urbanized village and relatively undisturbed tundra in the nearby Barrow Environmental Observatory. The modified Berggren solution, an advanced analytic solution to the general Stefan problem of calculating frost and thaw depth, was used in a geographic context to map ALT over the 150 km² area investigated in the Barrow Urban Heat Island Study. The Berggren solution performed well for estimating mean values of ALT in rural and urban land-cover classes. Compared to the Stefan solution, it provides highly accurate results and is promising for use in urban environments as a vehicle for mapping fine-scale variations in ALT.",

Independent of different water mass properties planktic carbon isotope records (13C/12C) from across the Nordic Seas show a rather consistent pattern over the course of the Holocene. We present data from a number of sediment cores obtained in the central Nordic Seas which show that carbon isotope values were increasing since the early Holocene. They reached a maximum level between 7 and 6 ka and remained relatively stable thereafter. Ca. 3 ka they rapidly decreased. Benthic carbon isotope records from the central Nordic Seas, close to the present-day convection center of the Greenland Sea, reveal a similar trend as the planktic records. Although of lower amplitude, these bottom water data reflect the development of the regional deep convection in this region. A comparison with other proxy records and modelling results supports this presumption. While the early to late Holocene trend apparently reflect the developing deep convection after the last glacial period, the sudden decrease in the convection strength around 3 ka was most probably triggered by a strong solar irradiance minimum. This, combined with low insolation, caused an expansion of the sea ice over the convection center and enhanced stratification, thereby strengthening the entire halocline system.",

            "abstract": "Models of microbial dynamics coupled to solute transport in aquifers typically require the introduction of a bacterial carrying capacity term to prevent excessive microbial growth close to substrate-injection boundaries. The factors controlling this carrying capacity, however, are not fully understood. Most explanations for the occurrence of a carrying capacity discussed are based on the assumption of a bottom-up control of groundwater ecosystems. An alternative explanation is based on top-down control. Our model considers substrate, bacteria and higher trophic levels, such as grazers or bacteriophages. The dissolved substrate is transported with water flow whereas the biomasses of bacteria and grazers are considered essentially immobile. The one-dimensional reactive transport model also accounts for substrate dispersion and a random walk of grazers influenced by the bacteria concentration. The grazers grow on the bacteria, leading to a negative feedback on the bacteria concentration which may limit the turnover of the substrate.\nA single retentostat model with Monod kinetics of bacterial growth and a second-order grazing shows that the system oscillates but approaches a stable steady state with non-zero concentrations of substrate, bacteria, and grazers. The steady-state concentration of the bacteria biomass is independent of the substrate concentration in the inflow. When coupling several retentostats in a series to mimic a groundwater column, the steady-state bacteria concentrations remain at a constant level over a significant travel distance. The results show that grazing is a possible explanation of the carrying capacity, provided that there is enough substrate to sustain bacteria and grazers.",

            "abstract": "It is puzzling why slow earthquakes occur in hot subduction zones only. We study numerically how antigorite dehydration coupled with slip-induced dilatancy and thermal pressurization affects rupture behavior to solve the above puzzle. Recent related studies actually suggest importance of antigorite dehydration. We assume faulting in a 2D thermoporoelastic medium. The mineral reaction is assumed using a first order Arrhenius law. Nondimensional parameters important in the modeling are Su, Su’ and X’ according to our former study; Su’ and Su are proportional to permeability and increase rate of slip-induced porosity. X’ denotes volume change induced by the reaction. Our calculation shows that moment release rate and fault tip growth rate are smaller for larger values of Su, smaller values of X’ or smaller values of Su’. These two rates are found to be negligibly small compared with the solutions for the dynamic elasticity analysis when Su>1 and X’<0 are satisfied. Slow sustained fault growth occurs for such values of Su and X’. This suggests that Su>1 and X’<0 are satisfied at hot subduction zones; the condition X’<0 is consistent with the reaction expected at hot subduction zones. In cold subduction zones however, antigorite dehydration will occur at depth greater than 60km, with -0.1<X’<0. Our calculation shows that fault growth rate accelerates to the shear wave speed soon after the rupture nucleation for any values of X’ when Su<1 is assumed. However, the moment release rates for negative values of X’ are found to be a few orders smaller than expected by the dynamic elasticity analysis. This occurs because the slip velocity evolution is more pulse-like for larger values of |X’|. In such way, antigorite dehydration could also be the source of a non-negligible fraction of intermediate depth seismicity. The condition Su<1 will be due to the fact that slip-dilatancy is more prohibited at larger depth.",

Earth Girl 2 is based on real-life situations, with an emphasis on learning preparedness and survival skills. It was inspired by the kids who live in coastal communities throughout Asia, and by the stories told by survivors of recent tsunamis.\nThe action takes place in four main areas: the Market, the Map, the Toolbox, and two dozen game levels with a variety of evacuation scenarios. The gameplay encourages proactive exploration and discovery of these scenarios, with Earth Girl providing knowledge, tips and feedback throughout the game. The basic game play includes: learning about tsunami hazards by talking to people at the market, choosing tools based on a budget, exploring the site and making strategic decisions, and learning from watching the simulation. The level of success of players in this game depends on their strategic decisions which is somewhat tied to their level of interaction with the virtual community. The game is currently being tested with children in Southeast Asian communities and is scheduled for release in late 2014.\nThe presentation will demonstrate aspects of the game (played on an iPad connected to the projector), and will describe some of the challenges and solutions encountered by the interdisciplinary team.",

However, for the Hellinger software [\nKirkwood et al., 1999\n] to produce stable results, we find that the input data must be abundant and spatially well distributed. Although magnetic anomalies and fracture zone data have been increasingly abundant since the 1960s, some parts of the globe remain too sparsely explored to provide enough data for the Hellinger code to provide satisfactory rotations.\nIn this poster, we present new software to calculate the paleopositions of tectonic plates using magnetic anomalies and fracture zone data. Our method is based on the theory of plate tectonics as introduced by [Bullard et al., 1965] and [Morgan, 1968], which states that ridge segments (ie. magnetic lineations) and fracture zones are at right angles to each other. In order to test our software, we apply it to a region of the world where climatic conditions hinder the acquisition of magnetic data: the Southwest Pacific, between New Zealand and Antarctica from breakup time to chron 20 (c43Ma).\nBullard, E., J.

            "abstract": "Cumulus cloud populations remain at least partially unresolved in present-day numerical simulations of global weather and climate, and accordingly their impact on the larger-scale flow has to be represented through parameterization. Various methods have been developed over the years, ranging in complexity from the early bulk models relying on a single plume to more recent approaches that attempt to reconstruct the underlying probability density functions, such as statistical schemes and multiple plume approaches. Most of these \"classic\" methods capture key aspects of cumulus cloud populations, and have been successfully implemented in operational weather and climate models. However, the ever finer discretizations of operational circulation models, driven by advances in the computational efficiency of supercomputers, is creating new problems for existing sub-grid schemes. Ideally, a sub-grid scheme should automatically adapt its impact on the resolved scales to the dimension of the grid-box within which it is supposed to act. It can be argued that this is only possible when i) the scheme is aware of the range of scales of the processes it represents, and ii) it can distinguish between contributions as a function of size. How to conceptually represent this knowledge of scale in existing parameterization schemes remains an open question that is actively researched.\nThis study considers a relatively new class of models for sub-grid transport in which ideas from the field of population dynamics are merged with the concept of multi plume modelling. More precisely, a multiple mass flux framework for moist convective transport is formulated in which the ensemble of plumes is created in “size-space”. It is argued that thus resolving the underlying size-densities creates opportunities for introducing scale-awareness and scale-adaptivity in the scheme. The behavior of an implementation of this framework in the Eddy Diffusivity Mass Flux (EDMF) model, named ED(MF)n, is examined for a standard case of subtropical marine shallow cumulus. We ask if a system of multiple independently resolved plumes is able to automatically create the vertical profile of bulk (mass) flux at which the sub-grid scale transport balances the imposed larger-scale forcings in the cloud layer.",

            "abstract": "We present three-dimensional fully kinetic and electromagnetic simulations of the solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic anomalies (LMAs). Using the implicit particle-in-cell code iPic3D, we confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the lunar surface forming a mini-magnetosphere, as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. In contrast to earlier MHD and hybrid simulations, the fully kinetic nature of iPic3D allows to investigate the space charge effects and in particular the electron dynamics dominating the near-surface lunar plasma environment. We describe the general picture of the interaction of a dipole model centered just below the lunar surface under various solar wind and plasma conditions, and focus afterwards on the ion and electron kinetic behavior of the system. It is shown that the configuration is dominated by electron motion, because the LMA scale size is small with respect to the gyroradius of the solar wind ions. The dominant LMA interaction mechanism is also highly dependent on the solar wind and IMF conditions. Driven by strong pressure anisotropies, the mini-magnetosphere is also unstable over time, leading to only temporal shielding of the surface underneath. Our work opens new frontiers of research toward a deeper understanding of LMAs and is ideally suited to be compared with field or particle observations from spacecraft such as Kaguya (SELENE), Lunar Prospector or ARTEMIS. The ability to evaluate the implications for future lunar exploration as well as lunar science in general hinges on a better understanding of LMAs.\nThis research has received funding from the European Commission’s FP7 Program with the grant agreement SWIFF (project 2633430, swiff.eu) and EHEROES (project 284461, www.eheroes.eu).

            "abstract": "Karstic lakes in the Iberian Range (Central Spain) provide a unique opportunity to test the human impact in the watersheds and the aquatic environments during historical times. We reconstruct the depositional evolution and the changes in biogeochemical cycles of El Tobar karstic lake, evaluating the response and the resilience of this Mediterranean ecosystem to both anthropogenic impacts and climate forcing during the last 1000 years.\nLake El Tobar (40°32′N, 3°56′W; 1200 m a.s.l.; see Figure), 16 ha surface area, 20 m max. depth and permanent meromictic conditions, has a relatively large watershed (1080 ha). Five 8 m long sediment cores and short gravity cores where recovered, imaged, logged with a Geotek, described and sampled for geochemical analyses (elemental TOC, TIC, TN, TS), XRF scanner and ICP-MS, and dated (137Cs and 10 14C assays). The record is a combination of: i) laminated dark silts with terrestrial remains and diatoms and ii) massive to banded light silts (mm to cm –thick layers) interpreted as flood deposits. Sediments, TOC, and Br/Ti and Sr/Ca ratios identify four periods of increased sediment delivery occurred about 1500, 1800, 1850 and 1900 AD, coinciding with large land uses changes of regional relevance such as land clearing and increased population.\nTwo main hydrological changes are clearly recorded in El Tobar sequence. The first one, marked by a sharp decrease in Mg, Ca and Si concentrations, took place about 1200 AD, and during a period of increasing lake level, which shifted from shallower to deeper facies and from carbonatic to clastic and organic-rich deposition. This change was likely related to increased water availability synchronous to the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age. The second one was a canal construction in 1967 AD when a nearby reservoir provided fresh water influx to the lake, and resulted in stronger meromictic conditions in the system after canal construction, which is marked by lower Fe/Mn and higher Br/Ti ratios. The lake depositional and geochemical cycles, however, recovered quickly after each crisis, showing a strong resilience of the lacustrine system.\nFigure: A) Location; B) Ortoimage; C) Geologic map; D) Bathimetry and main lake inputs/outputs.",

            "abstract": "Wood is a key component in forested streams, playing an important ecological and physical role in creating step-pool profiles, enhancing habitat heterogeneity, retaining organic matter, and changing water velocity. Wood additions can increase surface water-groundwater exchange, increasing in-stream residence times by slowing water velocities and providing high depositional areas for fine particles (i.e. particulate nutrients C, N, P). Thus, wood additions may create biogeochemical hotspots in streams that allow greater potential for local nutrient cycling and processing. The objectives of this research were to determine if added wood enhances in-stream heterogeneity, results in more complex flow paths, increases natural retention of further organic matter and changes geomorphic characteristics of the stream reach. We conducted a conservative solute and fluorescent fine particle tracer injection study in an agriculturally impacted stream with emplaced wood additions to estimate in-stream retention times in the Whatawhata catchment, North Island of New Zealand. Although similar solute peak concentrations were observed at the different in-stream sampling sites, increased retention was observed near to the wood. Both fine particle deposition and retention time was increased near the emplaced log. Fine particles were also analyzed in situ in sediment and biofilms on cobbles throughout the stream reach following the injection. A direct positive correlation was observed between cobble biofilm biomass and particle accumulation within this retention area. In general, the addition of wood to these agriculturally impacted streams enhanced hydraulic complexity and increased the retention of solute and fine particles.",

            "abstract": "Over half of the population of the UK own a smartphone, and about the same number of people uses social media such as Twitter. For the British Geological Survey (BGS) this means millions of potential reporters of real-time events and in-the-field data capturers, creating a new source of scientific information that could help to better understand and predict natural processes.\nBGS first started collecting citizen data, using crowd-sourcing, through websites and smartphone apps focused on gathering geological related information (e.g. mySoil and myVolcano). These tools ask volunteers to follow a guided form where they can upload data related to geology and geological events; including location, description, measurements, photos, videos, or even instructions on sending physical samples. This information is used to augment existing data collections.\nSocial media provides a different channel for gathering useful scientific information from the public. BGS is starting to explore this route with the release of GeoSocial-Aurora , a web mapping tool that searches for tweets related to aurora sightings and locates them as markers on a map. Users are actively encouraged to contribute by sending tweets about aurora sightings in a specific format, which contains the #BGSaurora hashtag, the location of the sighting, and any comments or pictures. The tool harvests these tweets through the Twitter REST API and places them on the map, enabling the user to generate clusters and heatmaps.\nGeoSocial-Aurora provides scientists with a potential tool for gathering useful data for scientific analysis. It collects actual aurora sighting locations, enabling users to check where the aurora is taking place in real time. This may, in time, help scientists to improve future predictions of when and where auroras are visible.",

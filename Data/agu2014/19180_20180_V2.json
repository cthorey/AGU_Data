            "abstract": "Most aerosol mass spectrometers rely on measuring the terminal velocity that the particles acquire in the introduction of the air sample into vacuum to determine the particle size (aerodynamic diameter). This is done by measuring the time-of-flight between two defined points in the particle beam path. In the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, a chopper with a narrow slit (typically 2% throuput for acceptable size resolution) is used to gate the incoming particle beam and record a velocity distribution as the particles hit the vaporizer/ionization chamber. The low duty cycle of the chopper leads to low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for rapidly changing conditions and/or low aerosol concentrations, as well as the need to alternate between a total mass mode (with typically a 60% duty cycle) and size-segregated mode.\nA new chopper assembly has been constructed and tested that uses a multi-slit pattern with a particle throughput of 50%. Using an inversion method that has successfully been used previously in ion time-of-flight spectrometry (Hadamard transform), a full particle velocity spectrum can be acquired with both high S/N and very good resolution (equivalent to a traditional 1% chopper wheel).\nWe have shown that this method retrieves realistic particle size distributions regardless of aerosol volatility and that the S/N improvements are consistent with the increase in duty cycle. These can be improved even further by using noise filtering techniques. We have deployed the new chopper at two field campaigns (SOAS and SEAC4RS) and confirmed the performance of the new technique with ambient aerosol.\nThe increased duty cycle also means that both total mass and size-segregated measurements can be taken at once within the same (uninterrupted) datastream, greatly increasing the overall data coverage in both modes. Both ambient and chamber data will be presented to demonstrate this new AMS acquisition mode.",

            "abstract": "The persistence of pyrogenic materials (hereafter referred to as char) in terrestrial ecosystems is of interest both from a carbon cycle modelling perspective and a climate change mitigation standpoint. However, the fate of newly introduced char in soils remains unclear. Recent reviews attempting to summarize trends in char decomposition have come to differing conclusions, further stressing the complexity of factors dictating char stability in soils. The current dataset specifically addresses the stability of char additions to a tropical clay-rich soil, possible priming effects, and interactions among char, microbial communities and the mineral matrix. 13C- and 15N-labeled Acer rubrum(red maple) wood was combusted at 400°C and added to surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (20-30 cm) soils from the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Soils were incubated for 13 and 345 days at 26°C. Following incubation, intact microaggregates were frozen and cryosectioned into thin sections of approximately 5 µm thickness and mounted on gold-coated quartz slides. Thin sections were examined by synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and high resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). The combination of these µm to nm scale techniques allowed us to create corresponding spatial maps of native organic matter, char, and mineral phase distribution, track spatial variability in organic matter molecular structure, and dispersion of 13C and 15N isotopic labels. We present preliminary results indicating a high degree of stability of char in these wet tropical soils throughout the incubation period, suggesting that applied char may persist for long periods of time in similar soils.",

            "abstract": "Urban- and agriculturally-impacted streams face widespread water quality challenges from excess nutrients, metals, and pathogens from nonpoint sources, which the hyporheic zone (HZ) can capture and treat. However, flow through the HZ is typically small relative to stream flow and thus water quality contributions from the HZ are practically insignificant. Hyporheic exchange is a prominent topic in stream biogeochemistry, but growing understanding of HZ processes has not been translated into practical applications. In particular, existing HZ restoration structures (i.e. cross-vanes) do not exchange water efficiently nor control the residence time (RT) of downwelling streamwater.\nHere we present subsurface modifications to streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) to drive efficient hyporheic exchange and control RT, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the HZ. Coordinated high K (i.e. gravel) and low K (i.e. concrete, clay) modifications are termed Biohydrochemical Enhancement structures for Streamwater Treatment (BEST). BEST can simply use native sediments or may also incorporate reactive geomedia to enhance reactions.\nThe contaminant mitigation potentials of BEST were estimated based on hyporheic flow and RT outputs from MODFLOW and MODPATH models and reported nutrient, metal, and pathogen removal rate constants from literature for specific porous media. Reactions of interest include denitrification and removal of phosphate, metals, and E. coli.\nSimulations showed that BEST structures in series can substantially improve water quality in small streams along reaches of tens of meters. The model results are compared to observed data in tank and constructed stream experiments. Preliminary results with BEST incorporating woodchip geomedia demonstrate rapid denitrification exceeding model predictions. These experiments should establish BEST as a novel stream restoration structure or Best Management Practice (BMP) option to help practitioners achieve stormwater compliance.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic applications of paleomagnetism rely upon establishment of paleohorizontal at the time of magnetization. Paleohorizontal can be established in sedimentary rocks and volcanics, but is poorly constrained in plutonic rocks and areas that have experienced regional remagnetizations. This study will explore another latitudinal-dependent property of the geomagnetic field- elongation of elliptical distributions of directional data- to evaluate whether the combination of elongation and inclination can be used to constrain effects of tilt or other paleohorizontal uncertainties in paleomagnetic datasets. This work is inspired by the application of the E-I relationship proposed by Tauxe and Kent (2004) to evaluate effects of inclination error in sedimentary rocks.\nThe first example is from the Blue Mountains of eastern OR. Remagnetized Permian-Jurassic sedimentary rocks (Hillhouse et al, 1982, Harbert et al, 1995, Housen, 2007, Kalk, 2008) have magnetizations that match those of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous plutons (Wilson and Cox, 1980, Housen, 2007). Directions from 64 sites of these rocks yields a mean of D = 33°, I = 64°, k= 26, α95 = 3.7°. The E-I method can be used to determine the effects of calculated paleohorizontal errors by finding an optimal paleohorizontal error that results in the best agreement between E and I for a set of data. For the Blue Mountains rocks, the optimal E-I relationship yields a corrected inclination of I = 65° (+7°/-4°), and estimated paleolatitude of 47°N (42° to 57°).\nThe second example is from the Cretaceous Mt Stuart batholith in the North Cascades of central WA- these 95-88 Ma plutonic rocks have well defined magnetizations (Housen et al, 2003). Directions from 89 samples have a mean of D = 350°, I=44°, k=50, α95 = 2.1°. The E-I relationship suggests a corrected mean inclination of I=46° (+12°/-3°), and estimated paleolatitude of 27°N (25° to 39°).\nFor the Blue Mountains, this comparison indicates that the plutons and remagnetized rocks have a mean I and E that agree well and suggest little paleohorizontal error. For the Mt Stuart batholith- the E/I corrected inclination suggests only moderate tilt is likely- and agrees well with the inclination of these rocks corrected independently using barometry to estimate paleohorizontal (I= 51°).",

            "abstract": "Interdisciplinary work has become a cornerstone in research across the environmental sciences. Our work does so by evaluating biogeochemical cycling, specifically methane, in the context of landscape hydrology. Atmospheric methane is a greenhouse gas 27 times more potent than carbon dioxide and has been increasing at an unprecedented rate. This drastic increase in atmospheric methane has been attributed to anthropogenic activities such as burning of fossil fuels, ruminants, and rice cultivation, which together constitute approximately 67% of global methane sources. Characterizing CH4 flux in natural systems has remained difficult due to complex relationships among environmental variables (e.g. soil temperature and soil water content). To address this, we focus on how the redistribution of water in complex terrain influences the magnitude and direction of flux in upland and riparian soils. Distilling this complex behavior and scaling these observations is complicated by interacting feedback loops and uncertainties associated with global scale modeling. However, progress is critical given that predicting future climate is necessary to forecasting the quantity and distribution of available fresh water, and understanding how ecosystem processes, and energy/food production will be affected. Water sciences and environmental science as a whole must improve communication to a range of audiences, and advocate for researchers, policy makers, and business leaders to work together for a more sustainable future. A crucial step in this process is to optimize the appropriate level of information to convey that is both memorable and meaningful given the complexity of environmental systems. The challenge also extends to artists and filmmakers to present the subject in compelling ways that inspire audiences to take action in their own communities. True integration of professionals across environmental, social, political, and economic disciplines while motivating local involvement will be necessary for development and success of innovative solutions for improving the trajectory of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Releases of hydrocarbons from oil spills can have large environmental impacts in both the ocean and atmosphere. While evaporation of oil following a spill is mainly modeled simply as a mass loss mechanism, the resulting production of atmospheric pollutants can also be a major concern, particularly for continental releases, such as wrecks of train-tanker or river barges, and near-shore rig releases. Both may occur near population centers. The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 presented a unique opportunity to observe significant secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production due to a large oil spill. Following on these observations, we have conducted a series of measurements on evaporation of oil while explicitly accounting for changes in chemical composition occurring as a function of evaporation time. In this work we use GC×GC-VUV-HRTOFMS to achieve unprecedented characterization of oil composition from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, and how it changes with time following release. Roughly 75% of the total mass of the alkane mixture comprising the oil was classified according to degree of branching, number of cyclic rings, aromatic character, and molecular weight. Such detailed and comprehensive characterization of the DWH oil allows for bottom-up estimates of the relationship between oil volatility and composition. We developed an evaporative model, based solely on our composition measurements and thermodynamic data (vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization), rather than common boiling point parameterizations, which is in excellent agreement with published mass evaporation rates and allows for prediction of potential SOA production as a function of both wind speed (evaporation rate) and oil composition. Our measurements yield different oil volatility distributions than previously inferred; this suggests accurate prediction of SOA formation requires detailed oil composition measurements. A wind tunnel was used to verify model predictions. Sustained SOA yields on the order of a gram m-2 day-1 are predicted under calm sea conditions.",

            "abstract": "Performing realistic simulations of solar eruptions and validating those simulations with observations are important goals in order to achieve accurate space weather forecasts. Here, we perform and analyze results of a global magnetohydrodyanmic (MHD) simulation of the fast coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on 2011 March 7. The simulation is made using the newly developed Alfven Wave Solar Model (AWSoM), which describes the background solar wind starting from the upper chromosphere and expands to 24 Rs. Coupling of AWSoM to an inner heliosphere (IH) model with the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) extends the total domain beyond the orbit of Earth. Physical processes included in the model are multi-species thermodynamics, electron heat conduction (both collisional and collisionless formulations), optically thin radiative cooling, and Alfven-wave pressure that accelerates the solar wind. The Alfven-wave description is physically consistent, including non-WKB reflection and physics-based apportioning of turbulent dissipative heating to both electrons and protons. Within this model, we initiate the CME by using the Gibson-Low (GL) analytical flux rope model and follow its evolution for days, in which time it propagates beyond 1 AU. A comprehensive validation study is performed using remote as well as in-situ observations from SDO, SOHO, STEREOA/B, and OMNI. Our results show that the new model can reproduce many of the observed features near the Sun (e.g., CME-driven EUV waves, deflection of the flux rope from the coronal hole, \"double-front\" in the white light images) and in the heliosphere (e.g., CME-CIR interaction, shock properties at 1 AU). The CME-driven shock arrival time is within 1 hour of the observed arrival time, and nearly all the in-situ parameters are correctly simulated, which suggests the global MHD model as a powerful tool for the space weather forecasting.",

In the specified meteorology model configuration of WACCM-X, the lower atmosphere is constrained by operational analyses and/or short-term forecasts provided by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) of GMAO/NASA/GSFC. With the terrestrial weather of GEOS-5 and updated model physics, WACCM-X simulations are capable to reproduce the observed signatures of the perturbed wave dynamics and ion-neutral coupling during recent (2006-2013) stratospheric warming events, short-term, annual and year-to-year variability of prevailing flows, planetary waves, tides, and composition. With assimilation of the NWP data in the troposphere and stratosphere the planned-operational configuration of WAM can also recreate the observed features of the ITM day-to-day variability.\nThese “terrestrial-weather” driven whole atmosphere simulations, with day-to-day variable solar and geomagnetic inputs, can provide specification of the background state (first guess) and errors for the inverse algorithms of forthcoming NASA ITM missions, such as ICON and GOLD. With two different viewing geometries (sun-synchronous, for ICON and geostationary for GOLD) these missions promise to perform complimentary global observations of temperature, winds and constituents to constrain the first-principle space weather forecast models. The paper will discuss initial designs of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) in the coupled simulations of TIME-GCM/WACCM-X/GEOS5 and WAM/GIP. As recognized, OSSE represent an excellent learning tool for designing and evaluating observing capabilities of novel sensors. The choice of assimilation schemes, forecast and observational errors will be discussed along with challenges and perspectives to constrain fast-varying dynamics of tides and planetary waves by observations made from sun-synchronous and geostationary space-borne platforms. We will also discuss how correlative space-borne and ground-based observations can evaluate OSSE results.",

            "abstract": "In-situ observation of dust grains from various origins is continuously performed by space missions equipped with radio instruments. These measurements consist in observations of voltage pulses, or their spectral signature. It has for long been proposed that one of the mechanisms able to produce these pulses is the recollection by the spacecraft of electric charges generated by impact ionization.\nHere for the first time, on the basis of this charge recollection assumption, a complete theoretical model of how pulses are generated is proposed. This model makes it possible to reproduce the precise shape of a voltage pulse, including the sometimes observed \"voltage undershoot\" following the pulse, knowing the local plasma parameters.\nWe use the data provided by S/WAVES and show that it strongly supports the model proposed. Even though other processes may be responsible for radio pulses generation, we show here that recollection process is unambiguously observed.\nThe model proposed is an important step forward, in that it enables us to reproduce the shape, timescales and amplitudes of pulses generated by dust impacts in various space environments. Such a model can be used to infer the dust-detection abilities of different radio instruments onboard different spacecraft, including future missions Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus.",

            "abstract": "We present a theoretical study of the fracture of two-dimensional disc-shaped samples due to the penetration of a projectile focusing on the dynamics of fracturing and on the geometrical structure of the generated crack pattern. The penetration of a cone is simulated into a plate of circular shape using a discrete element model of heterogeneous brittle materials varying the speed of penetration in a broad range. As the cone penetrates a destroyed zone is created from which cracks run to the external boundary of the plate. Computer simulations revealed that in the low speed limit of loading two cracks are generated with nearly straight shape. Increasing the penetration speed the crack pattern remains regular, however, both the number of cracks and their fractal dimension increases. High speed penetration gives rise to a crack network such that the sample gets fragmented into a large number of pieces. We give a quantitative analysis of the evolution of the system from simple cracking through fractal cracks to fragmentation with a connected crack network. Simulations showed that in the low speed limit of loading the growing cracks proceed in discrete jumps separated by periods when the crack tips are pinned. The statistics of the size of jumps and of the waitng times shows scale free behaviour, i.e. power law distributions are obtained with universal exponents. Dependence on the loading speed was pointed out only for the cutoffs of the distributions. In the high speed limit of loading the sample falls apart forming a large number of fragments. The size of fragments proved to be power law distributed where dependence on the loading speed is observed only for the cutoffs. The value of the exponent has good agreement with experiments.",

            "abstract": "Rivers, their profiles and network reflect the integration of multiple processes and forces that are part of the fundamental controls on the relief structure of mountain belts. The motivation of this study is to understand active tectonic processes in the forearc region of subduction zones, by distinguishing evidence of active deformation using the river network and topography. To this end, morphotectonic and structural studies have been conducted on fifteen drainage basins on the mountain front, parallel to the Mexican subduction zone, where the Cocos plate underthrusts the North American plate. The southwest – northeast Cocos plate subduction stress regime initiated ca. 20 MA. NE-SW to NNE-SSW normal faults as well as sub-latitudinal to NW-SE strike-slip faults (both dextral and sinistral) constitute the majority of mesofaults recorded in the field within the studied drainage basins. Occasionally dextral N-S strike-slip faults also occur. The stress tensor reconstruction suggests two main evolution stages of these faults: 1) the older is dominated by a NW-SE to WNW-ESE extensional regime and 2) the younger is a transcurrent regime, with NNE-SSW σ1 axis. The drainage pattern is strongly controlled by tectonic features, whereas lithology is only a subordinate factor, with only one exception (Petatlán river). Generally, major rivers flow from north to south mainly through NE-SW and NNE-SSW normal faults, and/or sub-longitudinal dextral (also locally sinistral) strike-slip faults. In the central and eastern part of the studied area, rivers also follow NW-SE structures, which are generally normal or sinistral strike-slip faults (rarely reverse). In most cases, local deflections of the river main courses are related to sub-latitudinal strike-slip faults, both dextral and sinistral. Within the current stress field related to the active Cocos subduction, both normal and strike-slip fault sets could be reactivated. Our analysis suggests that strike-slip faults, mainly left lateral, are probably active because they are offsetting the main stream courses of the largest river basins; however only few focal mechanisms are associated to these faults. We hypothesize that these faults are active, perhaps experiencing slow events or associated fault creep. Further studies are needed to solve this problem.",

            "abstract": "Human civilizations around the globe have been influenced by abrupt climate change throughout the Holocene. The paucity of high-resolution palaeoclimate data from the “Cradle of Civilization” in West Asia, however, has limited our ability to evaluate the potential role of Holocene climate variability on early societies. We present a high-resolution, multi-proxy reconstruction of aeolian input and palaeoenvironmental conditions based on a 13-kyr record of ombrotrophic (rain fed) peat from Neor Lake in Northwest Iran. Variations in relative abundances of major and trace elements, total organic carbon (TOC), stable carbon isotopes of TOC (δ13CTOC) and compound-specific leaf wax hydrogen isotope (δD) compositions suggest dry and dusty conditions prevailed during the Younger Dryas, and a substantial increase in atmospheric dust loading and decrease in moisture availability occurred between the early and late Holocene. In addition, variations in radiogenic Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition and REE anomalies in samples from Neor peat core indicate significant shifts occurred in source contributions of eolian material to the study area between the Younger Dryas, early and late Holocene. Time-series analysis of aeolian input to NE Iran reveals periodicities at 540, 1050 and 2940 years that correspond with solar variability and internal climate feedbacks identified in other records of Holocene climate change from the northern hemisphere. Transitions in major Mesopotamian and Persian civilizations, including the collapse of the Akkadian empire at 4,200 yr BP, the fall of the Ur III empire at 3,955 yr BP, the fall of Elam empire at 2,500 yr BP and the demise of the Achaemenids around 2,280 BP overlap with major dust events from this study. Several other episodes of enhanced atmospheric dust, however, are not reflected in historical or archaeological accounts of the late Holocene. This indicates either abrupt climate change was not the sole driver of societal changes in the region, or that historical records of these events are incomplete.",

            "abstract": "Due to their importance as both GCS reservoir rocks and seals, the geochemical behavior of carbonates, such as limestones and dolomites, in acidic environments is relatively well-studied topic. However, the feedbacks between dissolution processes and permeability are not fully understood, particularly for fractured carbonates at in-situ stress conditions. A key open problem is the evolution of fracture aperture (and therefore permeability) for induced fractures in low permeability carbonates. We present the results of a dynamic synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXR-μCT) experiment investigating changes in fracture aperture in a dolomite sample during dissolution induced by CO2 saturated water. The dolomite sample used for the experiment was sourced from the Duperow formation of North central Montana, and consisted of a 3/8” cylindrical sample, 7/8” long, with a single vertical fracture. CO2 bearing solution was flowed through the the sample in a μCT high pressure vessel for ~ one week at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min under 1400 psi pore pressure and 1700 psi confining pressure. XR tomographic scans were taken at different time steps to follow the evolution of fracture apertures. Results show that the evolution of the fracture is extremely complex: the calcite fraction present in the sample (~5%) dissolves readily showing a prompt retreat in the fragments contacting the fracture surface. In contrast, dolomite zones develop a leached layer ~250 μm thick, rich in micropores along the surfaces of the fracture. With the evolution of the system, a wormholing effect becomes more evident with the development of channels of preferential dissolution along the paths of maximum fluid velocity, where the leached layer becomes less evident and faster bulk dissolution of the dolomite is observed. The main aperture of the fracture remains fairly constant during dissolution; even after an increase in confining pressure (2300 psi), no closure was observed. This highlights how the weakening of the contact points, under these experimental conditions, is not as strong as some models might suggest. Likewise, these observations indicate that reactive fracture models may require inclusion of a porous altered zone in the near-fracture region to adequately represent feedbacks between dissolution and permeability.",

            "abstract": "The carbon cycle presents challenges to researchers – in how to understand the complex interactions of fluxes, reservoirs, and systems – and to outreach professionals – in how to get across the complexity of the carbon cycle and still make it accessible to the public. At Cornell University and the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca, NY, researchers and outreach staff tackled these challenges together through a 2013 temporary museum exhibition: Moving Carbon, Changing Earth.\nMoving Carbon, Changing Earth introduced visitors to the world of carbon and its effect on every part of our lives. The exhibit was the result of the broader impacts portion of an NSF grant awarded to Natalie Mahowald, Professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, who has been working with a team to improve simulations of regional and decadal variability in the carbon cycle. Within the exhibition, visitors used systems thinking to understand the distribution of carbon in and among Earth’s systems, learning how (and how quickly or slowly) carbon moves between and within these systems, the relative scale of different reservoirs, and how carbon’s movement changes climate and other environmental dynamics. Five interactive stations represented the oceans, lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and a mystery reservoir. Puzzles, videos, real specimens, and an interview with Mahowald clarified and communicated the complexities of the carbon cycle.\nIn this talk we’ll present background information on Mahowald’s research as well as photos of the exhibition and discussion of the components and motivations behind them, showing examples of innovative ways to bring a complex topic to life for museum visitors.",

            "abstract": "Most ecological models of decomposition rely on plant litter chemistry. However, growing evidence suggests that the chemical composition of organic matter (OM) is not a good predictor of its eventual fate in terrestrial or aquatic environments. New data on variable decomposition rates of select organic compounds challenge concepts of chemical recalcitrance, i.e. the inherent ability of certain molecular structures to resist biodegradation. The role of environmental or “ecosystem” properties on influencing decomposition dates back to some of the earliest research on soil OM. Despite early recognition that the physical and aqueous matrices are critical in determining the fate of organic compounds, the prevailing paradigm hinges on intrinsic chemical properties as principal predictors of decay rate. Here I build upon recent reviews and discuss new findings that contribute to three major transformations in our understanding of OM persistence: (1) a shift away from an emphasis on chemical recalcitrance as a primary predictor of turnover, (2) new interpretations of radiocarbon ages which challenge predictions of reactivity, and (3) the recognition that most detrital OM accumulating in soils and in water has been microbially processed. Predictions of OM persistence due to aromaticity are challenged by high variability in lignin and black C turnover observed in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Contradictions in the behavior of lignin are, in part, influenced by inconsistent methodologies among research communities. Even black C, long considered to be one of the most recalcitrant components of OM, is susceptible to biodegradation, challenging predictions of the stability of aromatic structures. At the same time, revised interpretations of radiocarbon data suggest that organic compounds can acquire long mean residence times by various mechanisms independent of their molecular structure. Understanding interactions between environmental conditions and biological reactivity can improve predictions of how disturbance events can further stabilize or destabilize organic C pools, with implications for terrestrial C storage, aquatic C cycling, and climate change.",

            "abstract": "River deltas are dynamic systems composed of a network of channels and interchannel islands that are subject to forces such as river discharge, tides, wind, and anthropogenic activities. The delivery of water, sediment, and nutrients from the channel to the delta floodplain is important for maintaining and evolving delta systems. This delivery depends on the connectivity between channels and delta floodplains. Connectivity is a concept that has been investigated extensively in tributary systems but remains relatively unexplored in delta distributary networks. This may be due to the structure of delta networks, often more complex than the one of tributary networks, and forces such as wind and tides acting on delta systems.\nIn this study, we present a framework for analyzing connectivity in river delta networks and present field evidence of surface water connectivity mechanisms from Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana, USA through measurements of water discharge and hydraulic tracer propagation. Calculated discharges from velocity measurements reveal that 46-77% of the flow exits the system via the distributary channels, while the remaining volume is routed to the islands, highlighting the importance of channel-island connectivity and the role of islands in the hydrological network at WLD. Tides and wind also play an important role in the channel-island connectivity by modulating flow into and out of the islands, as well as influencing the hydraulic residence time of the inundated island interiors, which has implication for nutrient cycling. A framework for analyzing connectivity in river deltas is presented, in which we characterize the importance of dynamic island inundation, environmental forces, and network structure.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we examine the physical weathering of Ferrar dolerite clasts along a multi-million-year-old soil chronosequence on Mullins Glacier, a debris-covered glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. Collected morphological field data show that: (1) with increasing distance from the headwall, clasts become more rounded and deeply buried by surrounding sediment; (2) clasts with exposure histories > ~20,000 years exhibit disintegration via flaking of mm-scale surface fragments; (3) these flakes increase in thickness with distance, with an overall average of 1.8 mm. Coupling the field data with improved chronological control for surface ages, we estimate an erosion rate of ~9 cm Ma-1 via flaking, which represents ~ 60% of the currently assumed maximum erosion rate for the region. We test thermal fatigue as a mechanism for flake detachment by collecting high-frequency temperature data for rock surfaces and at depth on multiple clasts, as well as meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed/direction, solar intensity) during the austral summer. Vertical temperature gradients across flakes surpassed 8°C during the 28-day study interval, and rates of surface temperature change exceeded 5°C min-1. The latter value greatly exceeds the accepted value for producing thermal fracture in igneous rocks. Dolerite samples were also collected to determine rock surface albedo, near-surface geochemistry, and mechanical properties; these data, in combination with the acquired field data, were used to create a model of internal temperature and thermally induced stresses in a typical clast. Overall, our results demonstrate that the production of altered rinds modifies thermal properties at the rock surface and may help facilitate fracture at the interface between altered and unaltered material. Additional sediment analyses show that the detached flakes add to the surrounding regolith, increasing in abundance with inferred soil age. This process modifies clast shape and promotes self-burial, providing a negative feedback to further erosion. Our measurements imply that the detachment of altered material on Mullins Glacier represents a dynamic equilibrium process that may have important implications for rates of landscape evolution in ice-free polar deserts like the MDV.",

            "abstract": "Several poorly understood faults are exposed along the mid- and lower slope offshore southern California from Encinitas to San Clemente. From south to north, these faults have been referred to as the Carlsbad, San Onofre, and San Mateo fault zones, which are generally characterized as nearly vertical to steeply east-dipping faults with a reverse slip component. The U.S. Geological Survey collected high-resolution seismic reflection and bathymetric data from 2009-2012 to better characterize these faults. From offshore Encinitas to Oceanside, these data reveal a complex and variable fault zone that structurally controls the slope-basin transition. In this area, the faults show both reverse as well as normal offset, but may also include an unknown amount of strike-slip offset. North of Oceanside, however, faulting shows clear evidence of right-lateral slip, offsetting submarine channels near the base of the slope by approximately 60 m. North of these offset channels, the base of the slope bends about 30° to the west, following the trend of the San Mateo fault zone, but fault strands on strike with those that offset the channels trend obliquely up slope, appearing to merge with the Newport-Inglewood fault zone (NIFZ) on the shelf. These fault strands consist of several en echelon left-stepping segments separated by “pop-up” structures, which imply a significant component of right-lateral offset along this fault zone, and thus may serve to transfer right-lateral slip from faults along the base of the slope to the NIFZ. This fault zone also separates structures associated with the San Mateo fold and thrust belt to the west from undeformed slope sediments to the east. The existence of significant right-lateral slip on faults along the slope and slope-basin transition has implications for assessing seismic hazards associated with the NIFZ, and also provides constraints on possible reverse motion on the hypothesized Oceanside Thrust.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of observing, describing, understanding and modeling the global climate and particularly the Maritime Continent, is a better knowledge of the fluxes of momentum, heat and freshwater in the ocean. The Indonesian seas are the only major low-latitude connection in the global oceans. This connection permits the transfer of Pacific waters into the Indian Ocean, known as the Indonesian Throughflow. The interaction of the Pacific and Indian basins and their modes of variability (El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)), both through atmospheric teleconnections and the ocean link via the Indonesian Throughflow, is now being hotly pursued in the research community.\nWe will present some initial findings from the 3-year time series (2011-2014) of the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait moorings. This mooring array is a component of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), and builds on the earlier results of the INSTANT (2003-2006) observational program. The moorings comprise of velocity, temperature and salinity instruments. Observations from these moorings provide the required spatial and temporal coverage to understand ocean dynamics, the ocean’s role in climate variability and change, investigate forcing of the atmosphere and ocean and assess the realism of data-assimilative ocean models and coupled ocean-atmosphere models.",

            "abstract": "We present a synthesis of seismic observations that allow us to test models of ridge segmentation and subridge mantle flow beneath active oceanic spreading centers. Active-source experiments conducted along segments of the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), the intermediate-spreading Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR), and the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) resolve the seismic velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle on the scale of 5 to 10 kilometers. Second-order discontinuities in the mid-ocean ridge (MOR) system have commonly been attributed to a decrease in magma supply from the upwelling mantle. However, the observed increase in the magnitude of mantle low-velocity zones, interpreted as zones of subcrustal melt accumulation, near these discontinuities is in direct contradiction to this view. Segment-scale measurements of seismic anisotropy at these three locations also reveal a new characteristic of MORs that may be commonplace: A systematic misalignment between the orientation of plate divergence and the direction of mantle flow. Crustal anisotropy, assumed to result from preferentially aligned cracks, is used to infer the current orientation of tensile tectonic stress driving plate separation. At the MAR, JdFR, and EPR the orientation of crustal anisotropy is consistent with the orientation of plate divergence predicted from plate velocity models. Passive mantle flow models predict that mantle anisotropy, resulting from strain-induced olivine LPO, should trend parallel to the direction of plate divergence. However, beneath each of these spreading segments, mantle anisotropy is rotated away from the plate divergence direction. The geometry of these misalignments correlates with recent rotations of the Euler poles in each plate system and with the sense of offset at 2nd-order discontinuities. We discuss alternative models of ridge segmentation and mantle flow geometries and their implications for lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the North and South Atlantic bidecadal sea level (SL) oscillations in the twentieth century (1908-2008) is investigated using SODA 2.2.4 reanalysis and 102 monthly mean SL time series from TG stations provided by PSMSL. Bidecadal SL signal extraction was done using our method of subjectively choosing groupings of space-time data into non-overlapping period bands by use of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)/ Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) analysis. A CEOF analysis of the SODA bidecadal band shows dominance of 22–24 year periods. Propagating bidecadal mode expansions were then determined through this analysis, which gives two principal modes. The first mode is dominant from 1915 to 1965 and the second from 1970 onward. The amplitude variabilities obtained suggests the presence of regime shifts, which coincide in time with shifts actually observed in European climate and South African lobster fisheries. The first mode is characterized by states with North and South Atlantic subtropical gyres in phase, while tropical and subpolar regions are in opposite phase relative to them. The second mode is characterized by the subpolar gyre and North subtropical gyre almost in quadrature, with North and South subtropical gyres out of phase. The evolution mechanism of this latter mode is related to east-west density contrasts and westward propagating Rossby waves. These waves show phase speeds dominated by geostrophic self-advection of density anomalies relative to the mean meridional density gradient as known from previous studies, but are shown to be additionally influenced by bottom topography. The oscillations caused by these waves are shown to have phase differences (quadrature in the North Atlantic) with regional indices of bidecadal AMOC oscillations. A number of SL-AMOC fingerprints are also reviewed, and a new eastern equatorial fingerprint is proposed.",

            "abstract": "Unlike other oceans, the Arctic Ocean is completely surrounded by permafrost, which is being degraded at an increasing rate under warming conditions most pronounced in East Siberian region and Alaska. The thaw and release of organic carbon (OC) from Arctic permafrost is postulated to be one of the most powerful mechanisms causing the net redistribution of carbon from lands and oceans to the atmosphere. The East Siberian Arctic shelf (ESAS) is the world’s largest continental shelf, containing more than 80 % of the world oceans’ subsea permafrost and the largest hydrocarbon reservoir on the planet, while the stability of this sequestered carbon, which exists primarily as CH4, is highly uncertain. This area is heavily influenced by subsea permafrost thaw, and CH4 seeps from subsea permafrost reservoirs under warming conditions. Various other phenomena influence the area, including coastal erosion, mostly caused by onshore permafrost/coastal ice complex thaw; the input of dissolved and particulate OC through the Lena, Indigirka, and Kolyma rivers. The ESAS is also of particular interest for its carbon-climate couplings because thawing of onshore and offshore permafrost leads to the CH4 and CO2 emission to the atmosphere. The overall goal of the current research is to provide a quantitative, observation-based assessment of the dynamics of different ESAS carbon cycle components with emphasize on the emission of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere under changing climatic and environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Slow-moving earthflows regularly exhibit seasonal velocity patterns driven by transient perturbations in effective normal stress that alter the frictional resistance along the sliding surface. These annual velocity patterns are ubiquitous in slow-moving landslides throughout the world, with individual landslides often displaying complex spatial patterns of acceleration that can vary from year to year. Here, we model landslide motion using a rate- and state-dependent frictional treatment that incorporates variations in effective normal stress and material properties, including both velocity-weakening (VW) and velocity-strengthening (VS) patches, along the sliding surface. We calculate changes in effective stress by allowing rainfall-induced changes in pore-water pressure to diffuse vertically from the ground surface to the landslide base. We then solve for changes in frictional strength and velocity along a 1D slip surface that extends the length of the landslide. Model parameters are calibrated using measurements from laboratory tests, field instruments, and satellite InSAR. Our model is able to produce seasonal variations in sliding rate that mimic the patterns commonly displayed by these slope failures. We use our model to identify the conditions under which these slides can transition from non-catastrophic motion to catastrophic failure. We find that non-catastrophic motion occurs if the landslides are comprised of entirely VS material or if their spatial dimensions do not exceed a critical nucleation length, which is determined by the ratio of VW to VS material and the effective stress. Furthermore, this modeling framework suggests that landslides that exhibit spatially varying motion (i.e. consisting of an ensemble of smaller slip patches) may be less likely to fail catastrophically when compared to landslides that exhibit spatially uniform motion if differences in the timing of motion along the landslide reflect the presence of temporary slip barriers (i.e. strong patches). Our rate and state friction model provides a new way to view the evolution of slow-moving earthflows and to predict their behavior. Future work would benefit from additional laboratory tests on materials from a broad (i.e. worldwide) distribution of earthflows to better constrain their frictional properties.",

            "abstract": "In the study presented here, we used the COSmIC/Titan Haze Simulation (THS) experiment, an experimental platform developed to study Titan’s atmospheric chemistry at low temperature, to produce aerosols representative of the early stages of Titan’s aerosol formation. In the THS, the chemistry is simulated by plasma in the stream of a supersonic expansion. With this unique design, the gas is jet-cooled to Titan-like temperature (~150K) before inducing the chemistry by plasma, and remains at low temperature in the plasma discharge (~200K). Because of the pulsed nature of the plasma, the residence time of the gas in the discharge is only a few microseconds, which leads to a truncated chemistry and allows for the study of the first and intermediate steps of the chemistry. Different N2-CH4-based gas mixtures can be injected in the plasma, with or without the addition of heavier precursors present as trace elements on Titan, in order to monitor the evolution of the chemical growth. Both the gas phase and solid phase products resulting from the plasma-induced chemistry can be monitored and analyzed using a combination of complementary in situ and ex situ diagnostics.\nIn a recently published study, a mass spectrometry analysis of the gas phase has demonstrated that the THS is a unique tool to probe the first and intermediate steps of Titan’s atmospheric chemistry at Titan-like temperature. In particular, the mass spectra obtained in a N2-CH4-C2H2-C6H6 mixture are relevant for comparison to Cassini’s CAPS-IBS instrument. Here we present the results of a complementary study of the solid phase. Scanning Electron Microscopy images have shown that aggregates produced in N2-CH4-C2H2-C6H6 mixtures are much larger (up to 5 μm in diameter) than those produced in N2-CH4 mixtures (0.1-0.5 μm). Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) combined with Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) have detected the presence of aminoacetonitrile, a precursor of glycine, in the THS aerosols. IR measurements show the influence of the trace elements on the balance between aliphatic and aromatic functional groups present in the aerosols. These complementary studies show the high potential of THS to better understand Titan’s chemistry and the origin of aerosol formation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is supported by NASA SMD PATM.",

            "abstract": "Plagioclase crystals from silicic (andesitic to dacitic) lavas and domes at Volcán Uturuncu, a potentially active volcano in the back-arc of the Andean CVZ (22.3°S, 67.2°W), exhibit large variations in An contents, textures, and core to rim 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Many of the isotopic variations can not have existed at magmatic temperatures for more than a few thousand years. The crystals likely derived from different locations in the crustal magmatic system and mixed just prior to eruption. Uturuncu magmas initially assimilated crustal rocks with high 87Sr/86Sr ratios. The magmas were subsequently modified by frequent recharge of more mafic magmas with lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios. A typical Uturuncu silicic magma therefore only attains its final composition just prior to or during eruption.\nIn the Lazufre region of active surface uplift (~25˚14’S; Volcán Lastarria and Cordon del Azufre) closed system differentiation processes are not the only factors influencing silicic magma compositions. 87Sr/86Sr (0.70651-0.70715) and 206Pb/204Pb ratios (18.83-18.88) are highly elevated and143Nd/144Nd ratios (0.512364 –0.512493) are low relative to similar composition rocks from the “southern Cordillera domain.” These data, along with major and trace element trends, reflect a multitude of differentiation processes and magma sources including crystallization-differentiation of more mafic magmas, melting and assimilation of older crustal rocks, and magma mixing and mingling.\nOn an arc-wide scale silicic lavas erupted from three well-characterized composite volcanoes between 21oS and 22oS (Aucanquilcha, Ollagüe, and Uturuncu) display systematically higher K2O, LILE, REE and HFSE contents and 87Sr/86Sr ratios with increasing distance from the arc-front. In contrast, the lavas have systematically lower Na2O, Sr, and Ba contents; LILE/HFSE ratios; 143Nd/144Nd ratios; and more negative Eu anomalies. Silicic magmas along the arc-front apparently reflect melting of relatively young, mafic composition amphibolitic source rocks with the continental crust becoming increasingly older with a more felsic bulk composition toward the east. We suggest this results from progressively smaller degrees of mantle partial melting, primary melt generation, and crustal hybridization with distance from the arc-front.",

            "abstract": "The South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) on Mars is an icy reservoir of CO2. If all the CO2 trapped in the SPRC were released to the atmosphere the mean annual global surface pressure would rise by ~20 Pa. Repeated MOC and HiRISE imaging of scarp retreat within the SPRC led to suggestions that the SPRC is losing mass. Estimates for the loss rate vary between 0. 5 Pa per Mars Decade to 13 Pa per Mars Decade. Assuming 80% of this loss goes directly into the atmosphere, an estimate based on some modeling (Haberle and Kahre, 2010), and that the loss is monotonic, the global annual mean surface pressure should have increased between ~1-20 Pa since the Viking mission (~20 Mars years ago).\nSurface pressure measurements by the Phoenix Lander only 2.5 Mars years ago were found to be consistent with these loss rates. Last year at this meeting we compared surface pressure data from the MSL mission through sol 360 with that from Viking Lander 2 (VL-2) for the same period to determine if the trend continues. The results were ambiguous. This year we have a full Mars year of MSL data to work with. Using the Ames GCM to compensate for dynamics and environmental differences, our analysis suggests that the mean annual pressure has decreased by ~ 8 Pa since Viking.\nThis result implies that the SPRC has gained (not lost) mass since Viking. However, the estimated uncertainties in our analysis are easily at the 10 Pa level and possibly higher. Chief among these are the hydrostatic adjustment of surface pressure from grid point elevations to actual elevations and the simulated regional environmental conditions at the lander sites. For these reasons, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is no significant difference in the size of the atmosphere between now and Viking. This implies, but does not demand, that the mass of the SPRC has not changed since Viking.\nOf course, year-to-year variations are possible as implied by the Phoenix data. Given that there has been no unusual behavior in the climate system as observed by a variety of spacecraft at Mars since Phoenix, its seems more likely that the Phoenix data simply did not have a long enough record to accurately determine annual mean pressure changes as Haberle and Kahre (2010) cautioned. In the absence of a strong signal in the MSL data, we conclude that if the SPRC is loosing mass it is not going into the atmosphere reservoir.",

            "abstract": "The volume of a volcano's magma reservoir places a fundamental limit on the maximum size of an eruption (neglecting significant co-eruptive recharge), and also controls the temporal evolution of eruptive activity. Geochemical residence times, the volumes of aseismic zones beneath volcanoes, and the volumes of past eruptive products may all be used to estimate reservoir volume, but most estimates are associated with a great deal of uncertainty and can vary by an order of magnitude or more for a single volcano.\nSimple eruption models which assume that eruption rate is proportional to the pressure in a deflating elastic reservoir suggest that the reservoir volume should be directly proportional to the erupted volume, to the magnitude of ground deformation around the volcano, and to the rate of change of these observations during an eruption. However, these observations are inadequate for directly estimating reservoir volume; we must also place constraints on reservoir pressure or properties of the conduit linking the reservoir to the surface.\nUsing simple theoretical models and Monte Carlo simulations with more sophisticated models we evaluate our ability to place limits on reservoir volume using different combinations of information including ground deformation, eruption rate, the changing surface heights of active lava lakes, and the compressibility of the magma-reservoir system. Particularly useful in combination with geodetic data is constraint on co-eruptive pressure change, inferred from limitations on host rock strength or changing lava lake height; observations of the latter have allowed for a direct estimate of the shallow reservoir volume at Kīlauea Volcano (on the order of one cubic km). We also demonstrate that geodetic and eruption rate data can provide constraint on a magma’s volatile content; conversely, independent constraint on volatile content (such as from melt inclusion data) can place a lower bound, and sometimes an upper bound, on reservoir volume.",

            "abstract": "Volcaniclastic turbidity currents can be caused by subaerial explosive eruptions. However, their flow and emplacement processes in oceanic environment are still ambiguous. Core data obtained by deep-ocean drilling give constraints on the origin of such turbidity currents and resultant deposits. In this presentation, stratigraphy and grain data of volcaniclastic deposits from IODP site U1398 cores are shown and the origin of the deposit is discussed. The site is located 120 km southwest of Dominica Island. The uppermost unit that we study extends 0-40 mbsf. The main part is composed of a series of thick massive volcaniclastic turbidites, and is divided into several subunits. Each subunit has a few to 10 m thick and is separated by thin layers of fine materials or hemipelagic mud. Most of the layers are massive, composed of sorted, medium to coarse sand, and poor in fines. Some are normally graded. The upper turbidite is thick and massive, and contains abundant pumice clasts. They tend to concentrate in middle or upper part of the layer. Components of matrix are represented by pumice, massive lava, crystals (pl, opx, cpx, qz, hbl, titanomagnetite), and sparse carbonates. Generally, in normally graded layers, upper finer part is rich in pumice and bioclasts, and lower part is richer in crystals. In some layers, crystal concentration in matrix vary in proportion up to 80 wt.%, and its variation is correlated with magnetic susceptibility data. Grain size and component characteristics and their variations are thought to reflect emplacement process of volcaniclastic turbidity currents. Importantly, the grain characteristics are almost identical to the previous description for subaerial deposits or piston core data of the Roseau Tuff (~30 ka B.P.) that originated from the largest eruption in the Lesser Antilles in the last 200,000 years. The eruption formed caldera(s) on land in Dominica, and the most of the materials were deposited beneath the sea. Also it has been thought that subaqueous flows travelled down >200 km in Grenada Basin. New data from the site U1398 will give insights into the emplacement processes of volcaniclastic turbidity currents from the explosive events in Dominica.",

            "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated the highly dynamic nature of hydrologic connectivity, and the vertical and spatial expansion of the active watershed area during wet periods. While activation of variable DOM and solute sources during expansion and contraction periods has been well documented in a number of systems, changes in nutrient loading to streams have rarely been linked explicitly to in-stream function.\nTo this end, we investigated the linkages between terrestrial mobilization of DOC and DIC, in-stream biogeochemical cycling, and downstream transport across scales in two geomorphically contrasting watersheds located in Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, Montana. We deployed a network of in-situ high frequency sensors with a focus on CO2, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent DOM, nitrate, and a suite of supporting chemical constituents every 30 minutes beginning with the onset of snowmelt and through summer baseflow recession.\nOur results suggest that DOM and DIC fluxes, as well as ecosystem processes such as metabolism, were coupled to watershed scale carbon accumulation and mobilization. In both watersheds, metabolism tracked the temporal trends of DOM loading from the terrestrial landscape, indicating that the streams are actively transforming allochthonous organic materials during transport. Headwater stream reaches in the watershed with more hydrologically connected riparian source areas exhibited elevated metabolism, carbon uptake, and carbon export as compared to streams in the watershed with less riparian connectivity, suggesting that the degree of riparian connectivity may explain spatial variation in metabolism and in-stream carbon cycling within and across stream networks.\nUltimately, this study highlights the tight coupling between terrestrial uplands and in-stream ecosystem processes in headwater catchments, and identifies spatio-temporal variation in hydrologic connectivity as a key driver of in-stream metabolic variation. We posit that the balance between biologically and physically driven in-stream fluxes (i.e. relative rates of metabolic components and downstream transport) across watersheds, stream network position, and time can provide new insight into the linkages of watershed and in-stream processes.",

            "abstract": "Although a great deal is known about crustal extensional processes in the East African Rift System (EARS), questions remain as to the impact of extension on the continental lithospheric mantle. The northernmost portion of the EARS is the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), which is divided into three sectors: the Northern, (NMER), Central (CMER), and the Southern Main Ethiopian Rift (SMER). The NMER-CMER transition coincides with the Yerer-Tullu Wellel volcanotectonic lineament (YTVL), and may represent a terrain boundary along which extension was directed during the Cenozoic. Here we present petrographic data from peridotite xenoliths contained within ~6 Ma lavas recovered along the western portion of the YTVL near Nekempte, Ethiopia to examine the characteristics of the lithospheric mantle, and how peridotite has responded to extensional strain. Our preliminary results show that the Nekempte xenoliths are deformed spinel-bearing lherzolites, which previous studies have constrained to the spinel lherzolites field at 1.1 GPa in the lithospheric mantle. Petrographic examination of these xenoliths reveals two generations of crystals. These generations are defined by both size and texture; the first generation (coarse crystals) being up to 4 mm in diameter and the second generation (fine crystals) being less than 1 mm in diameter. The samples contain two generations of olivine (Ol I and Ol II) and orthopyroxene (Opx I and Opx II), one generation of clinopyroxene (Cpx I), spinel (Spl I), amphibole (Amp), and many fluid inclusion trails. We compare these xenoliths to samples from Injibara, Lake Tana Province, approximately 200 km north of Nekempte on the Ethiopian Plateau, a region with less focused extensional strain. Xenoliths from Injibara are also spinel-bearing lherzolites, however they exhibit less strain and metasomatic textures in comparison to xenoliths from along the YTVL. Based on the petrographic and textural analyses performed, we propose that the larger scale recrystallization of mineral phases and metasomatic textures seen in the Nekempte xenoliths are a result of more focused extensional strain in the continental lithospheric mantle.",

We used both commercial and open-source photogrammetry software to create the mosaic and DEM imagery. Some of the most critical UAV-specific issues are: access to a launch/landing site, adequate landing zones, range, airspace contention with manned aircraft, and hardware reliability. While UAVs provide a lower-cost method for photogrammetry access, it also comes with a unique set of challenges.",

            "abstract": "Submarine gullies are common features on continental slopes on both passive and active margins, but the processes dictating gully formation and the role of gullies in deep-water sediment transport are topics of debate. The geometries of gullies can provide clues to understanding the processes by which they initiate and grow, particularly when considered in the context of surrounding submarine geomorphology. Further confidence in these interpretations can be gained by tracking the temporal history of gullies with evolution of the continental margin. The 500 km2 Tui 3D seismic survey from the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand, shows continental slope gullies and other channel features in a ~1 km-thick package of prograding shelf-slope clinoforms that developed over Pliocene-Pleistocene time. This dataset allows for documentation of gullies over ~3 Ma, through numerous cycles of initiation and burial. For this study, we manually interpreted clinoform packages to generate ‘paleo-seafloor’ surfaces that provide context such as position of the shelf edge, slope gradient and azimuth, and relative progradation and aggradation magnitudes. Gully geometries were obtained from detailed seismic interpretation guided by semblance and RMS amplitude imaging on these surfaces. Gullies are low sinuosity, with widths ranging from ~50-150 m and depths from a few tens to <100 m. Gullies are observed to grow in width and relief downslope without evidence for aggradational confinement (levees), and in some cases form gully ‘complexes’ hundreds of m wide in the lower slope region. These complexes are present through >150 m of stratigraphy, indicating that they are long-lived features on the slope. This further indicates that the frequency of flows along the gullies was enough to maintain their topographic expression during slope progradation and aggradation, and suggests that gullies play an integral role in transport processes on the slope.",

            "abstract": "The Boulder flood of September 2013 resulted in significant structural damage, inundated communities, and accelerated land erosion in central and northern Colorado. This exceptional event led to approximately 11,000 people being evacuated in the area as more than 17 inches of rain fell in parts of Boulder County, Colorado in seven days. This storm resulted from persistent southerly flow and high precipitable water values which were responsible for the record-breaking precipitation. This study assessed the factors associated with extreme precipitation events in both observations and climate model simulations. Satellite-based observed precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, and ERA-Interim Reanalysis of precipitable water and low-level winds were used in this study.\nProbability distribution functions (PDFs) were calculated for daily values of observational and reanalysis variables: precipitation, precipitable water, and low-level winds. Each of the PDFs were compared with equivalent variables in the CESM simulations and analyzed over three regions of different areal extent occupying the eastern Rocky Mountains. The PDF calculations were found to be sensitive to the choice of the spatial region with fewer high precipitable water events in the northern domain and a greater number of high precipitable water events in the more southerly domain. The similarities between observational and present-day CESM PDFs enabled us to study changes to PDF distributions in future climate simulations. They predict a significant increase in precipitable water over the Boulder flood region. Given the importance of high precipitable water in the 2013 Boulder flood precipitation event, the potential for more frequent and stronger flooding events in the future is significant.",

            "abstract": "Nitrification is the process of converting ammonium (NH­­4+) into nitrate (NO3-), and is a crucial step in removing nitrogen (N) from aquatic ecosystems. This process is governed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) that utilize the ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA). Studying the rates of nitrification and the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in south San Francisco Bay’s Artesian Slough, which receives treated effluent from the massive San Jose-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility, are important for understanding the cycling of nutrients in this small but complex estuary. Wastewater inputs can have negative environmental impacts, such as the release of nitrous oxide, a byproduct of nitrification and a powerful greenhouse gas. Nutrient inputs can also increase productivity and sometimes lead to oxygen depletion. Assessing the relative abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB, along with measuring nitrification rates gives vital information about the biology and biogeochemistry of this important N-cycling process. To calculate nitrification rates, water samples were spiked with 15N-labeled ammonium and incubated in triplicate for 24 hours. Four time-points were extracted across the incubation and the “denitrifier” method was used to measure the isotopic ratio of nitrate in the samples over time. In order to determine relative ratios of AOB to AOA, DNA was extracted from water samples and used in clade-specific amoA PCR assays. Nitrification rates were detectable in all locations sampled and were higher than in other regions of the bay, as were concentrations of nitrate and ammonium. Rates were highest in the regions of Artesian Slough most directly affected by wastewater effluent. AOB vastly outnumbered AOA, which is consistent with other studies showing that AOB prefer high nutrient environments. AOB diversity includes clades of Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas prevalent in estuarine settings. Many of the sequenced genes are related to estuarine sediment found at other sites in the San Francisco Bay as well as the Chesapeake Bay, China East Sea, and Pearl River Estuary. Our data provide evidence for the path that N takes once entering the estuary and also further characterize the behavior of nitrifying microorganisms in extremely high-nutrient aquatic environments.",

            "abstract": "Based on cross-correlations computed from 61 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) within the Juan de Fuca plate from the Cascadia Initiative experiment and 42 continental stations near the western US coast, we investigate the generation locations of the primary (11-20 sec period) and secondary (5-10 sec period) microseisms in the northern Pacific Ocean by analyzing the directionality of the microseism signals received in this region. (1) Ambient noise observed across the array is much different in the primary and secondary microseism bands, both in its azimuthal content and seasonal variation, indicating different source generation locations. (2) The principal secondary microseism signals propagate toward the east, consistent with source generation in deep water of the North Pacific, perhaps coincident with the region of body wave excitation observed by Gerstoft et al. [2008] and Landès et al. [2010]. (3) Local primary microseism sources within and near the Juan de Fuca plate are implied by observations of the azimuthal dependence of the fundamental mode Rayleigh wave amplitudes as well as observations of precursory arrivals in cross-correlations of ambient noise. The strongest local generation region is observed northwest of the Juan de Fuca plate near the coast of British Columbia perhaps near Graham Island. Weaker local sources appear to be oceanward of Vancouver Island and southern Oregon. (4) High quality Green’s functions are derived from cross-correlations between deep water OBSs and continental stations proving that deep water generated signals can efficiently propagate onto the continent and are well recorded by continental seismic stations, at least at periods longer than about 5 sec.\nIn conclusion, the primary and secondary microseisms are generated at different locations, with the secondary microseism dominantly coming from deep-water sources and the source of primary microseism having a significant component in the shallow waters of the eastern Pacific. These observations are consistent with different physical mechanisms for the generation of the two microseisms. Both microseisms above 5 sec period propagate efficiently from either deep or shallow water source regions to continental stations.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this presentation is to illustrate how a probabilistic simulation workflow can be built to provide real-time products, and therefore be used in a real-time decision support environment for volcanic plumes and ash clouds. Generating simulations of volcanic plumes and ash clouds requires knowledge of the eruption characteristics and the potential atmospheric variability, both above the volcano and at distal locations downwind as the ash cloud disperses. Often the initial event characteristics, such as plume height, particle size distribution, and eruption rate have a level of uncertainty associated to them. Therefore, there is a need to simulate the full spectrum of eruption inputs to a dispersion model, to produce a complete range of downwind ash concentrations and atmospheric mass loadings, each with their own probability. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) data are generated as ensemble members also, each representing a potential state of the atmosphere. Therefore, one needs to couple the NWP ensemble members to the eruption uncertainties to build the probabilistic ash cloud concentrations and mass loadings. Here, we show the results of a Lagrangian dispersion model, Puff, used with a one-dimensional volcanic plume model, BENT, to characterize the input variability, and coupled with ensemble NWP data to build a full probabilistic set of ash cloud simulations. We show how these real-time simulations can be generated and then compared to remote sensing data for calibration/validation of the simulations' probabilistic output and how end users could apply the developed products in their operational environment.",

            "abstract": "Based on observations of reconnection at Earth’s magnetopause we found that the amount of ion and electron heating, ΔTi and ΔTe, are both correlated with the Alfvén speed, VAL, based on the reconnecting magnetic field and the plasma number density measured in both inflow regions. Best fits to the data produce the empirical relations ΔTi = 0.13 miVAL2 and ΔTe = 0.017 miVAL2, where mi is the proton mass, indicating that the amount of ion (electron) heating is 13% (1.7%) of the inflowing magnetic energy per proton-electron pair. Our empirical relations may explain the relatively weak ion and electron heating in solar wind reconnection exhausts at 1 AU and strong heating to keV (~107-108 K) energies common in Earth’s magnetotail exhausts. The finding could potentially be used to evaluate the role of reconnection in plasma bulk heating in laboratory, solar and astrophysical contexts.",

            "abstract": "Earth's electron radiation belt dynamics are highly dependent on the state and evolution of the local and global magnetic field. Spacecraft observations provide sparce information on the current state of the radiation belts, however, together with physics-based modeling they may help to resolve the physical processes at work. The Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) model solves the Fokker-Planck equation in three dimensional invariant coordinates and includes parameterizations of multiple wave processes within the Earth's magnetosphere. The invariant formulation allows one to more effectively separate adiabatic and non-adiabatic changes in the radiation belt electron population. The Kalman filter provides a method to assimilate data with a model, while taking into account the errors associated with each parameter. A split-operator Kalman filter approach is applied in this study, which provides a fast, and computationally inexpensive tool to assimilate data over very long time periods. Data error estimates are derived through energy-channel-specific intercalibration, while model error estimates are adjusted dynamically based on the model forecast performance. In the current study, the reanalysis is applied to investigate the errors in various magnetic field models; knowledge which is vital for accurate modeling of the radiation belts. The goal of the analysis is to develop a quantitative understanding of the magnetic field model errors, and how they contribute to errors in the invariant coordinates of electron phase space density, namely M, K, and L*. Global reanalysis based on data from different MLT sectors and the current understanding of radiation belt physics, allows one to quickly identify any unphysical characteristics in a comparision between different MLT sectors. Two examples of inaccuracies found thus far are a mis-aligned slot region, and differences in the location and magnitude of PSD at fixed first and second invariants, both of which may be explained by magnetic field model errors. Several older magnetic field models, and the data-derived high-resolution and inner-magnetospheric T07 magnetic field model are applied at selected intervals during the Van Allen Probe mission to quantify their performance at different locations and under various conditions.

            "abstract": "Geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is proposed for the Nugget Sandstone in Moxa Arch, a regional saline aquifer with a large storage potential. For a proposed storage site, this study builds a suite of increasingly complex conceptual “geologic” model families, using subsets of the site characterization data: a homogeneous model family, a stationary petrophysical model family, a stationary facies model family with sub-facies petrophysical variability, and a non-stationary facies model family (with sub-facies variability) conditioned to soft data. These families, representing alternative conceptual site models built with increasing data, were simulated with the same CO2 injection test (50 years at 1/10 Mt per year), followed by 2950 years of monitoring. Using the Design of Experiment, an efficient sensitivity analysis (SA) is conducted for all families, systematically varying uncertain input parameters. Results are compared among the families to identify parameters that have 1st order impact on predicting the CO2 storage ratio (SR) at both end of injection and end of monitoring. At this site, geologic modeling factors do not significantly influence the short-term prediction of the storage ratio, although they become important over monitoring time, but only for those families where such factors are accounted for. Based on the SA, a response surface analysis is conducted to generate prediction envelopes of the storage ratio, which are compared among the families at both times. Results suggest a large uncertainty in the predicted storage ratio given the uncertainties in model parameters and modeling choices: SR varies from 5–60% (end of injection) to 18–100% (end of monitoring), although its variation among the model families is relatively minor. Moreover, long-term leakage risk is considered small at the proposed site. In the lowest-SR scenarios, all families predict gravity-stable supercritical CO2 migrating toward the bottom of the aquifer. In the highest-SR scenarios, supercritical CO2 footprints are relatively insignificant by the end of monitoring.",

            "abstract": "UAVSAR, which first became operational in 2009, has served as an operational testbed for the NI-SAR L-band radar concept and a unique instrument in its own right. UAVSAR supports a broad array of basic and applied geoscience, covering on smaller scale all the disciplines NI-SAR would be able to address on a global scale. Although designed specifically to provide high accuracy repeated flight tracks and precise imaging geometry for InSAR-based solid earth studies, its fully polarimetric operation, low noise, and consistent calibration accuracy has made it a premier instrument for PolSAR-based studies also. Since 2009 it has successfully imaged more than 16 million km2 and >4300 quad-polarimetric data products are now publicly available online. Upgrades made in the last year to automate the repeat track processing serve as a model for generating large volumes of InSAR products: Since January 2014 more than 700 interferometric products have been released, exceeding the output of all previous years combined. Standardly available products now include browse images of all InSAR acquisitions and coregistered single-look complex image stacks suitable for standard time series analysis. Here we present an overview of the wide range of studies utilizing UAVSAR data including those based on polarimetry and pair-wise and times series interferometry, highlighting both the unique capabilities of UAVSAR and the ways in which NI-SAR would be able to dramatically extend the capabilities.\nThis research was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

Recent observations of Saturn's ring system have revealed the presence of density waves within the rings excited by oscillation modes within Saturn, allowing for precise measurements of a limited set of the planet's mode frequencies. We construct interior structure models of Saturn, compute the corresponding mode frequencies, and compare them with the observed mode frequencies. The fundamental mode frequencies of our models match the observed frequencies (of the largest amplitude waves) to an accuracy of roughly 1%, confirming that these waves are indeed excited by Saturn's f-modes. The presence of the lower amplitude waves (finely split in frequency from the f-modes) can only be reproduced in models containing gravity modes that propagate in a stably stratified region of the planet. The stable stratification must exist deep within the planet near the large density gradients between the core and envelope. Our models cannot easily reproduce the observed fine splitting of the m=3 modes, suggesting that additional effects (e.g., significant latitudinal differential rotation) may be important.",

            "abstract": "The area of Western Alaska including the Selawik National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) is generally underrepresented in terms of permafrost thermal monitoring. Thus, the main objective of this study was to establish a permafrost monitoring network in Western Alaska in order to understand the spatial variability in permafrost thermal regime in the area and to have a baseline in order to detect future change. Present and future thawing of permafrost in the region will have a dramatic effect on the ecosystems and infrastructure because the permafrost here generally has a high ice content, as a result of preservation of old ground ice in these relatively cold regions even during the warmer time intervals of the Holocene. Over the summers of 2011 and 2012 a total of 26 automated monitoring stations were established to collect temperature data from the active layer and near-surface permafrost. While most of these stations were basic and only measured the temperature down to 1.5 m at 4 depths, three of the stations had higher vertical temperature resolution down to 3 m. The sites were selected using an ecotype (basic vegetation groups) map of very high resolution (30 m) that had been created for the area in 2009. We found the Upland Dwarf Birch-Tussock Shrub ecotype to be the coldest with a mean annual ground temperature at 1 meter (MAGT1.0) of -3.9 °C during the August 1st, 2012 to July 31st, 2013 measurement period. This is also the most widespread ecotype in the SNWR, covering approximately 28.4% by area. The next widespread ecotype in the SNWR is the Lowland and Upland Birch-Ericaceous Low Shrub. This ecotype had higher ground temperatures with an average MAGT1.0 of -2.4 °C during the same measurement period. We also found that within some ecotypes (White Spruce and Alder-Willow Shrub) the presence or absence of moss on the surface seems to indicate the presence or absence of near surface permafrost. In general, we found good agreement between ecotype classes and permafrost characteristics such as temperature, active layer thickness, and freeze back duration. Thus, we believe it might be possible to translate the ecotype map into a very high spatial resolution (30 m) permafrost map using our measurements. Such a map would be useful in decision making with respect to land use and understanding how the landscape might change under future climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Depleted oil and gas reserves have abandoned wellbore densities up to 10 per square kilometer (Crow, 2010). These locations are considered to have favorable geological structure and properties for CO2 sequestration. To understand the risk of CO2 leakage along these abandoned wellbores requires the simulation of a comprehensive set of realizations encompassing the potential scenarios. The simulations must capture transient, 3D, multi-phase effects (i.e. supercritical, liquid, and gas CO2 phases along with liquid reservoir and aquifer fluids), and include capillary and buoyant flow. Performing a large number of these simulations becomes computationally burdensome. In order to reduce this computational burden, regression approaches have been used to develop computationally efficient reduced order models to try to capture the general trends of the simulations. In these approaches, model inputs and outputs are collected from the transient simulations at each time step. Recognizing that many of the inputs to the regression approach come from time series (i.e. pressures and CO2 saturations) and that all of the outputs are time series (i.e. CO2 and brine flow rates), we develop a time-series matching approach. In this approach, CO2 and brine flow rate time series are estimated given input time series and parameters by averaging the flow rates of the collected simulations weighted by the similarity of their input time series and parameter. Similarity of both time series and parameters is calculated by the Euclidean distance. Euclidean distances are converted to a generalized likelihood metric, and used to weight the flow-rate time-series averages. We present a comparison of this time series matching approach to the MARS algorithm.",

The topography-based spatial structure is being applied in the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) to represent spatial heterogeneity influenced by topography, soil, and vegetation. In this study, different methods to represent subgrid land surface heterogeneity are explored. CLM simulations using the new spatial structure will be configured and compared against CLM simulations using the standard grid-based spatial structure over topographically and climatically contrasting regions of the United States to evaluate the implications of the new spatial structure in land surface modeling.",

            "abstract": "An ever-growing number of applications to expose, utilize, and process Earth Science data are developed every year. These applications are sometimes developed by large organizations with significant budgets, and at other times by graduate students or professors with short-term grant money and little else. Because of this wide variance in environments, these applications are rarely consistent in their approach to testing, hosting, presentation of information, and approach to maintenance. Many of these applications also continually re-invent solutions to common problems such as bug tracking, collaboration, source code management, user support and feedback, and deployment of new features.\nThe Earthdata Code Collaborative (https://ecc.earthdata.nasa.gov, typically referred to as the ECC) provides a unified and consistent environment for Earth Science application development, whether an application is developed by a team of 10, 50, or even 1. By using commercial products such as the Atlassian suite of tools (https://www.atlassian.com) and custom APIs, the ECC allows Earth Science applications to focus on science rather than infrastructure and tooling.\nThis session will detail the process by which the Earthdata Code Collaborative was developed, as well as the initial requirements that drove its inception. It will go on to demonstrate the current state of the ECC, and explore how bringing on applications–both internal to Earthdata and external–has shaped its requirements and implementation. Concepts such as code management, continuous integration (testing), and one-touch deployment will be explored in the context of Earth Science applications.",

            "abstract": "Phenocryst textures were observed to investigate elementary steps of magma mixing processes, using the andesite samples from two western Pacific island arcs; northern Honshu, Japan, and West Java, Indonesia. Andesite from Chokai volcano in northern Honshu was extensively investigated to determine endmember compositions from glass inclusion compositions, mineral compositions, and whole-rock compositions. Reversely zoned pyroxene phenocrysts coexist with normally zoned ones. Every reversely zoned pyroxene crystal consists of a magnesium-poor core that is rounded or irregular in shape and a more-magnesian, normally zoned margin. The margin exhibits concentric oscillatory zoning with broad normal zoning, implying overgrowth in a chemically fluctuating mixing magma. The thicknesses of margins vary crystal by crystal, and the chemical compositions of innermost margins are well correlated with the thicknesses, indicating that the commencement timing of overgrowth is different on every crystal. Most of normally zoned pyroxene exhibit identical characteristics with the margins of reversely zoned pyroxenes. Therefore, these normally zoned pyroxene crystals started growing in the chemically fluctuating magma, or during magma mingling, although magnesian cores of some normally zoned pyroxenes might be derived from mafic basalt endmember magma. Plagioclase phenocrysts exhibit very similar characteristics with the pyroxenes, involving coexistence of reversely zoned crystals and normally zoned crystals. Margins of reversely zoned crystals exhibit oscillatory bands with broad normal zoning, which is the identical occurrence with most of normally zoned plagioclase. Every core of reversely zoned plagioclase exhibits a resorption texture including dusty zoning. These crystal textures occur in mixed andesite from all examined volcanoes in two island arcs, implying that the formation of the textures is ubiquitous regardless of distance from volcanic fronts. The textures record the elementary steps of magma mixing involving resorption of felsic magma and crystallization in cooled mafic magma during thermal equilibration after the encounter, and oscillatory zoning produced by chemical fluctuation during traveling in heterogeneous mingling magma.",

Airborne measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at high spatio-temporal resolution (0.1 s or 10 m) improve our capabilities in characterizing primary emissions from fires and in studying chemical transformations in aging plumes.\nA biomass-burning plume from a forest understory fire was intercepted by the NASA P-3B near Dublin, GA, USA on September 29, 2013. VOCs were measured at high time resolution along with CO, CO2, NOx, O3, HCHO, aerosols and other air quality and meteorological parameters. Repeated measurements in the immediate proximity of the fire were used to determine VOC emission ratios and their temporal variations. Repeated longitudinal and transversal plume transects were carried out to study plume aging within the first hour of emission. We will discuss the observed OH-NOx-VOC chemistry (including O3 formation), the observed changes in the elemental composition of VOCs (e.g. O:C ratios) and the observed formation of SOA.",

Several studies that attempt to explain variability of GMSL during the instrumental record share the common assumption that GMSL variability is deterministic in nature and different from natural variations. Here we show that GMSL variability can alternatively be explained, at least in part, as being caused by random variations and hence not having a deterministic origin. This internal variability, which adds to externally forced changes (e.g. through anthropogenic climate change), is a consequence of the integrated character of GMSL, which is the cumulative addition of temporal contributions that exhibit random character, and whose integration results in GMSL variations with persistence on decadal-centennial time scales. The generation of variability by integration of random stationary noise (i.e. even in a constant climate) is a robust and fundamental feature of stochastically forced systems with memory. The integrated character of GMSL results in an intrinsic difficulty in distinguishing internal from externally forced variations.",

The limitations of current monitoring systems has pushed the provincial government to seek out advanced sensing technologies such as differential absorption lidar (DIAL) to help assess the impact of energy development and industrial operations. This instrument is housed inside a 36’ trailer and can be quickly staged and used to characterize source emissions and to locate fugitive leaks. DIAL is capable of measuring concentrations for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) at ranges of up to 3 km with a spatial resolution of 1.5 m. DIAL can map both CO2 and CH4, as well as particulate matter (PM) in a linear fashion; by scanning the laser beam in both azimuth and elevation, DIAL can create images of emissions concentrations and ultimately can be used to determine emission factors, locate fugitive leaks, assess plume dispersion and confirm air dispersion modeling. The DIAL system has been deployed at a landfill, a coal-fired power plant, and an oil sands production area. A system overview of the DIAL instrument and recent results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "To better understand the long-range atmospheric transport of microbial aerosols from Southeast Asia to the western North Pacific, marine aerosols were collected at a remote Island, Chichi-Jima on a biweekly basis during 1990-1993. These samples were investigated for the atmospheric abundances of hydroxy fatty acids (OH FAs). β-OH FAs are the major structural components of endotoxins in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) whereas w-OH FAs are present in cell walls of higher plants. Thus, we tested the applicability of the β-OH FAs (C10-C18) and ω-OH FAs (C16-C26) to assess the Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and contribution of terrestrial higher plants, respectively. The average concentrations of β- and ω-OH FAs show pronounced seasonal variability with spring maximum (~301 ng/m-3 and ~ 272 ng/m-3, respectively). The concentrations of total OH FAs increased in winter/spring and decreased in summer/autumn, except for 1992-93. This seasonal trend can be interpreted by the atmospheric transport of microbial soil dust and higher plant metabolites from the Asian continent during winter/spring, when westerly winds dominate over the western North Pacific. The even carbon predominance of β- and ω-OH FAs (80 and 74 % of total) in marine aerosols could be explained by their significant contribution from GNB and terrestrial higher plants. These results have implications towards assessing the bacterial transport in the continental outflows. This study also confirms that β-OH FAs can be used as bacterial tracers in ambient aerosol samples.\nKeywords: β- and ω-hydroxy fatty acids, terrestrial biomarkers, marine aerosols, GC-MS",

            "abstract": "As the amount of observational Earth and Space Science data grows, so does the need for learning and employing data analysis techniques that can extract meaningful information from those data. Space-based and ground-based data sources from all over the world are used to inform Earth and Space environment models. However, with such a large amount of data comes a need to organize those data in a way such that trends within the data are easily discernible. This can be tricky due to the interaction between physical processes that lead to partial correlation of variables or multiple interacting sources of causality. With the suite of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) data mining codes available at MSFC, we have the capability to analyze large, complex data sets and quantitatively identify fundamentally independent effects from consequential or derived effects. We have used these techniques to examine the accuracy of ionospheric climate models with respect to trends in ionospheric parameters and space weather effects. In particular, these codes have been used to 1) Provide summary \"at-a-glance\" surveys of large data sets through categorization and/or evolution over time to identify trends, distribution shapes, and outliers, 2) Discern the underlying “latent” variables which share common sources of causality, and 3) Establish a new set of basis vectors by computing Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) which represent the maximum amount of variance for each principal component. Some of these techniques are easily implemented in the classroom using standard MATLAB functions, some of the more advanced applications require the statistical toolbox, and applications to unique situations require more sophisiticated levels of programming. This paper will present an overview of the range of tools available and how they might be used for a variety of time series Earth and Space Science data sets. Examples of feature recognition from both 1D and 2D (e.g. imagery) time series data sets will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Deltas are unique environments that are rich in natural resources and human populations. As a result, human activities directly to the delta and indirectly to the watershed in the Anthropocene have led to changes within the deltaic system as a response to these natural and anthropogenic forces. Understanding the response of deltas to these new forcings will be critical to assess the vulnerability of deltas to global climate change and expanding human populations. The Brazos River Delta, located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, served as an ideal study area to investigate the effect of human activities on a delta. Historical alterations to the system include agricultural activity, jetty construction, an engineered mouth diversion, and reservoir construction throughout the early and mid 20th Century. Three subaerial deltaic growth phases were identified based on historic shoreline configurations, and combined with high-resolution geophysical data (swath bathymetry, side scan sonar, CHIRP subbottom profiling) from the subaqueous delta to investigate the subaqueous delta changes over time. Evidence from these alternating progradational and retrogradational periods are preserved within the subaqueous delta. The data showed that as the growth of the subaerial delta changed over time, the subaqueous clinoform was subjected to regions of progradation or abandonment. The abandoned clinoform sections were characterized by a thinning modern clinoform sequence downslope from an erosional scarp. High side scan sonar backscatter features are believed to distinguish exposed erosional surfaces throughout the subaqueous delta demarcating the abandoned sections at the seabed. Prograding clinoform areas lack these high backscatter features. In these areas the modern clinoform was relatively thicker and does not exhibit the upslope erosional scarps. This noticeable asymmetry across the subaqueous delta shows that the Brazos Delta has migrated southwestward resulting from shifts in the balance between fluvial sediment supply and marine processes. These shifts were attributed to the anthropogenic activity within the system. This study shows that deltaic responses to human activity can be characterized by dramatic morphological and sedimentological changes that can occur on decadal time scales.",

Moderate southwesterly tropospheric wind (~25m/s) was blowing over the rugged topography of the islands, generating mountain wave signature at the flight altitude. Spectacular small-scale gravity waves were simultaneously observed at the mesopause level using the USU Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM).

            "abstract": "A detailed understanding of gas-aerosol-cloud interaction within the turbulent atmosphere is of prime importance for an accurate understanding of Earth’s climate system. As one example: While every cloud droplet began as an aerosol particle, not every aerosol particle becomes a cloud droplet. The particle to droplet transformation requires that the particle be exposed to some critical concentration of water vapor, which differs for different combinations of particle size and chemical composition. Similarly, the formation of ice particles in mixed phase clouds is also catalyzed by aerosol particles. Even in the simplest scenarios it is challenging to gain a full understanding of the aerosol activation and ice nucleation processes. At least two other factors contribute significantly to the complexity observed in the atmosphere. First, aerosols and cloud particles are not static entities, but are continuously interacting with their chemical environment, and therefore changing in their properties. Second, clouds are ubiquitously turbulent, so thermodynamic and compositional variables, such as water vapor or other trace gas concentrations, fluctuate in space and time. Indeed, the coupling between turbulence and microphysical processes is one of the major research challenges in cloud physics.\nWe have developed a multiphase, turbulent reaction chamber, (dubbed the Π Chamber, after the internal volume of 3.14 cubic meters) designed to address the problems outlined above. It is capable of pressures ranging from sea level to ~ 100 mbar, and can sustain temperatures of +40 to -55 ºC. We can independently control the temperatures on the surfaces of three heat transfer zones. This allows us to establish a temperature gradient between the floor and ceiling inducing Rayleigh-Benard convection and inducing a turbulent environment. Interior surfaces are electropolished stainless steel to facilitate cleaning before and after chemistry experiments. At present, supporting instrumentation includes a suite of aerosol generation and characterization techniques, a laser Doppler interferometer, and a holographic cloud particle imaging system.\nWe will present detailed specifications, an overview of the supporting instrumentation, and initial characterization experiments from the Π chamber.",

In addition, currently no single hygrometer exists that allows a simultaneous, high-speed measurement of all phases (gas, liquid, ice) with the same detection principle. In the rare occasions multi-phase measurements are realized, gas-and condensed-phase observations rely on different methods, instruments and calibration strategies so that precision and accuracy levels are quite difficult to quantify. This is effectively avoided by the novel TDLAS instrument, HAI, Hygrometer for Atmospheric Investigation, which allows a simultaneous, high speed, multi-phase detection without any sensor calibration in a unique “2+2” channel concept. Hai combines two independent wavelength channels, at 1.4 µm and at 2.6 µm, for a wide dynamic range from 1 to 30 000 ppmv, with a simultaneous closed path (extractive) and open path detection. Thus, “Total”, i.e. gas-phase plus condensed-phase water is measured by sampling via a forward facing inlet into \"closed-path\" extractive cells. A selective, sampling-free, high speed gas phase detection is realized via a dual-wavelength \"open-path\" cell placed outside of the aircraft fuselage. All channels can be sampled with 120 Hz (measurement cycle time Dt=1.6 ms) allowing an unprecedented spatial resolution of 30 cm at 900 km/h. The evaluation of the individual multi-channel raw-data is done post flight, without any channel interdependencies, in calibration-free mode, thus allowing fast, accurate and precise multi-phase water detection in flight. The performance could be shown in more than 200 net flights hours in three scientific flight campaigns (TACTS, ESMVal, ML-CIRRUS) on the new German HALO aircraft. In addition the level of the accuracy of the calibration free evaluation was evaluated at the German national primary water vapor standard.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku (Tohoku-oki) earthquake caused increased seismicity in many inland areas in Japan. A triggered seismic cluster north of the Moriyoshi-zan volcano in Akita prefecture, Tohoku District, is of interest in light of the contribution of geofluids to seismic activity. We observed an active seismic cluster characterized by the migration of seismicity and reflected/scattered phases. We relocated hypocenters of the cluster using data from temporal observations and the hypoDD location technique, which significantly increased the hypocentral accuracy. We interpreted a complex spatiotemporal variation of seismicity in the cluster as the migration of pore fluid pressure from multiple pressure sources. The hydraulic diffusivity of the cluster was in the range of 0.01 to 0.7 m2/s and increased with time, implying that the migration of hypocenters accelerated after a pathway for fluids was formed by fracturing of the wall rock during the initial stage of seismic activity. A prominent feature of the seismograms is a reflected/scattered phase observed at stations around the volcano. We regard the phase as S-to-S scattered waves and estimated the location of the scatterers using a back-projection method. The scatterers are inferred to be located about 5 km northwest of the Moriyoshi-zan volcano, at an approximate depth of 13 km. The Moriyoshi-zan area is one of the source areas of deep low-frequency earthquakes that have been interpreted as events generated by the migration of geofluids. The depth of the scatterers is close to the upper depth limit of low-frequency earthquakes. Thus, we interpret the observed scatterers to be a reservoir of geofluid that came from the uppermost mantle accompanying contemporaneous low-frequency earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "In order to achieve a turbulent dynamo in the laboratory, we propose to use eutectic Gallium-Indium alloy (eGaIn) with suspended magnetic particles. One of the key challenges is to quantify the magnetic properties of the suspensions, such as the magnetic susceptibility. We measure the susceptibility of materials in both suspension and powder forms. The effective susceptibility is much smaller than the true material susceptibility due to the demagnetization field inside the body resulting from the long-range nature of the dipolar force acting between individual magnetic moments. The demagnetization field tends to decreases the local magnetic field inside the body. It is found that the effective susceptibility is a function of global aspect ratio of the sample (defined as the ratio of length to diameter in a cylindrical sample), local aspect ratio of individual particle, and packing fraction. The effective susceptibility increases with increasing global and local aspect ratio, and packing fraction. The predicted effective susceptibility based on a model of the demagnetization effect in powders (Skomski et al. 2007) is tested against our measured data. The model, which incorporates three affecting factors, can describe powders with relatively high packing fraction (>40%). For powders with low packing fraction (<40%), the measured susceptibility deviates from the model. We propose a correction of the model for the magnetic samples. The new model turns out to quantify the measured effective susceptibility of both solids and powders, which cover a wide range of aspect ratio (from 3 to 56) and packing fraction (from 4% to 45%). The present studies may also be useful to understand the effects of magnetic material distributions in biasing magnetic measurements in rock samples that are used in studies of paleomagnetism for example.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, the USGS entered a technical assistance agreement with the City of Los Angeles to apply the results of the 2008 ShakeOut Scenario of a M7.8 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault to develop a comprehensive plan to increase the seismic resilience of the City. The results of this project are to be submitted to the Mayor of Los Angeles at the Great ShakeOut on October 16, 2014. The ShakeOut scenario detailed how the expected cascade of failures in a big earthquake could lead to significant delays in disaster recovery that could create financial losses that greatly exceed the direct losses in the event. The goal of the seismic resilience plan is to:\nprotect the lives of residents during earthquakes\nimprove the capacity of the City to respond to the earthquake \nprepare the City to recover quickly after the earthquake so as to protect the economy of the City and all of southern California\nTo accomplish these goals, the project addresses three areas of seismic vulnerability that were identified in the original ShakeOut Scenario:\nPre-1980 buildings that present an unacceptable risk to the lives of residents, including “non-ductile reinforced concrete,” and “soft-first-story” buildings\nWater system infrastructure (including impact on firefighting capability)\nCommunications infrastructure\nThe critical science needed to support policy decisions is to understand the probable consequences to the regional long-term economy caused by decisions to undertake (or not) different levels of mitigation. The arguments against mitigation are the immediate financial costs, so a better understanding of the eventual benefit is required. However, the direct savings rarely justify the mitigation costs, so the arguments in favor of mitigation are driven by the potential for cascading failures and the potential to trigger the type of long term reduction in population and economic activity that has occurred in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina.",

            "abstract": "As first noted 200 years ago by P.S. Laplace, the Moon’s rotational and tidal bulges are significantly larger than expected, given the Moon’s present orbital and rotational state. This excess deformation has been ascribed to a fossil figure, frozen in when the Moon was closer to the Earth. However, the observed figure (quantified by the Moon’s moments of inertia, or degree-2 gravity field) is only consistent with an eccentric and/or non-synchronous orbit, contrary to our understanding of the Moon’s formation and evolution. Here, we show that lunar mascons and impact basins have a significant contribution to the observed lunar figure. Removing their contribution reveals a misaligned fossil figure consistent with an early epoch of true polar wander driven by the formation of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This mass anomaly corrected figure is also consistent with an elastic lithosphere that formed while the Moon was on an early low-eccentricity, synchronous lunar orbit. This new self-consistent model solves a long-standing problem in planetary science, and will inform future studies of the Moon’s dynamical evolution and early dynamo, and motivates future exploration of South Pole-Aitken.",

            "abstract": "Air quality in East Asia has a drastic temporal and spatial variability. The rapid economic growth in the last three decades enhanced the increase of anthropogenic emission of air pollutions, and caused deterioration of the air quality in both source and downwind regions. The unprecedented heavy PM­2.5 pollution over the central China in January 2013 records the maximum PM2.5 concentration of 996 μg/m3 and raised critical environmental issues (e.g., mortality, human health, social activity and trans-boundary transport, etc.). Recently, efforts to reduce anthropogenic emissions (e.g., emission regulations and improvements of emission factors and removal efficiencies) decelerate their growth rates. In fact, Asian SO2 emission is estimated to be reducing from 2007 [Kurokawa et al., 2013]. However, growth rates other pollutant emissions (e.g., NOx and PM10) still remain in high.\nTo understand the life cycle of pollutants (emission, transport, reaction and deposition) and their temporal and spatial variation, an integrated analysis using observation and numerical model (chemical transport model; CTM) is useful. In this study, we installed a comprehensive observation operator system, which converts model results into observed variables, into the GEOS-Chem CTM. A long-term (2005–2013) full-chemistry simulation over East Asia was performed, and simulation results are translated to tropospheric NO2 and SO2 columns and vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficient equivalent to satellite measurements and in-situ lidar network observations. Combining CTM and observations, and integrating analyses of aerosols over the downwind region and their precursors over the source region will provide important insights into temporal and spatial variation of air pollutants over East Asia.",

            "abstract": "The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is a multidecadal mode of Pacific basin SST anomalies, and is the basin-wide, bi-hemispheric expression of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The two indices are highly correlated, but the extent to which they are merely low frequency ENSO is debated. Nonetheless, the IPO/PDO significantly influences interannual rainfall variability and drought risk across and beyond the Pacific region on multi-decadal timescales, thus an understanding of long-term IPO/PDO variability will help with assessing past and future drought risk.\nA new and highly accurate 1 ky IPO reconstruction has been produced from the Law Dome ice core (East Antarctica). Law Dome is a high accumulation site on the coast of Antarctica in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, and the Law Dome record is directly related to atmospheric anomalies across a broad mid-latitude swathe of this region. The reconstruction utilizes both the accumulation (snowfall) and sea salt (wind proxy) records to produce a reconstruction that is highly calibrated to the instrumental IPO record from 1870-2009 and shows excellent skill (reduction of error value of 0.86).\nWe then super-imposed the 1 ky IPO on a Law Dome proxy for rainfall in eastern subtropical Australia (previously shown to represent rainfall with high significance during IPO positive phases (r =0.406–0.677, p <0.0001–0.01) to identify eight Australian ‘mega-droughts’ (dry periods >5 y duration) over the last millennium. Six mega-droughts occur between AD 1000-1320 including one 39 y drought (AD 1174–1212). Water resources and infrastructure planning in Australia has been based on very limited statistical certainty around drought risk due to the short instrumental record and lack of rainfall proxies. A recent drought (the ‘Big Dry’ ~1995-2009) brought both agricultural and urban water supplies to critically low levels, while the Murray-Darling Basin river system, which provides 65% of the water used for irrigation in Australia, was on the brink of ecosystem collapse. Clearly, decadal-scale droughts of the ‘Big Dry’ kind have occurred regularly in Australia’s past. This new reconstruction will help with assessing drought risk over the longer term in the Pacific Basin, particularly in the data-sparse Southern Hemisphere.",

We interpret these units to record the uplift and erosion associated with the inflating San Juan volcanic field caldera complexes ~ 35-30 Ma.

            "abstract": "For a long time anabranching patterns were primarily restricted to “exotic and remote” zones in arid systems such as Australia. For that reason, they were not accepted as a major topic of discussion in our discipline, which was based on concepts principally derived from case studies in the Northern Hemisphere. However, anabranching alluvial patterns are widespread in a variety of environments and scales, from arid small rivers to alluvial reaches of giant rivers such as the Amazon, Congo, and Negro. The largest rivers of the world in water discharge are anabranching, and the majority of the forty-five largest rivers (water discharges >5000m3s-1) are dominantly anabranching systems. Only a small number of rivers with meandering patterns, or sinuous with branches (meandering-tendency to anabranch) are part of the largest rivers group. The present large anabranching rivers with well developed floodplains flowing on lowlands have in common a characteristic very slow slopes, specific stream power of < 25 Wm-2 and sandy bed load with sand sizes dominantly ranging from 0.1 < D50 <0.5 mm. Large axial anabranching rivers also contain the largest floodplains. The diversity of planforms and island morphologies in large anabranching rivers result from autogenic adjustments to millennial scales in broad valleys and to century-decadal scale channel-floodplain processes. The variety of anabranching styles are not specifically related to a single explanatory “physically based theory” but to a variety of morphological processes, complex-channel floodplain interactions and the geologic characteristics of the valleys. Once considered a kind of oddity, anabranching rivers must be considered major and fundamental representatives of the fluvial world.",

To meet this challenge, we have been developing a Dynamic Information Framework (DIF), primarily through collaborations with the World Bank in Asia, Africa, and Brazil. The DIF is, essentially a decision support structure, built around \"earth system\" models. The environment is built on progressive information layers that are fed through hydrological and geospatial landscape models to produce outputs that address specific science questions related to water resources management of the region. Information layers from diverse sources are assembled, according to the principles of how the landscape is organized, and computer models are used to bring the information \"to life.\" A fundamental aspect to a DIF is not only the convergence of multi-sector information, but how that information can be conveyed, in the most compelling, and visual, manner. Deployment of the environment in the Cloud facilitates access for stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "The chemistry of water-soluble carbonyl compounds in clouds is now acknowledged as an important source of secondary organic aerosol. These reactive carbonyl compounds are oxidized to carboxylic acids and form oligomers by radical-radical reactions and by “dark reactions” with ammonium salts (AS) and/or amines. The latter class of reactions also produces light-absorbing brown carbon compounds, especially reactions involving methylglyoxal or glyoxal and amines. However, recent work has found that UV light fades the color of glyoxal + AS and methylgyloxal + AS reaction mixtures. We recently studied aldehyde-AS-amine reactions in sunlight and in control vessels at the same temperature to determine the effects of solar radiation on the aqueous-phase production of brown carbon. In sunlight, methylglyoxal reaction mixtures lost their initial color and failed to brown, indicating the photolytic loss of reactants and/or pre-brown intermediates. In many other reactions, brown products are lost to photolysis, reducing the overall browning of solutions exposed to sunlight. In other experiments, hydrogen peroxide was added to generate OH radicals by photolysis. In the presence of OH radicals, some carbonyl compound mixtures (e.g. those containing hydroxyacetone or glycolaldehyde) browned more rapidly when exposed to sunlight. This indicates the existence of uncharacterized photooxidative browning pathways involving aqueous-phase OH radicals, carbonyls, ammonium salts, and/or amine compounds.",

GETSI was born out of requests from geoscience faculty for more resources with which to educate future citizens and future geoscience professionals on the power and breadth of geodetic methods to address societally relevant topics. Development of the first two modules started at a February 2014 workshop and initial classroom testing begins in fall 2014. The Year 1 introductory module “Changing Ice and Sea Level” includes geodetic data such as gravity, satellite altimetry, and GPS time series. The majors-level Year 1 module is “Imaging Active Tectonics” and it has students analyzing InSAR and LiDAR data to assess infrastructure vulnerability to demonstratively active faults. Additional resources such as animations and interactive data tools are also being developed. The full modules will take about two weeks of class time; module design will permit portions of the material to be used as individual projects or assignments of shorter duration. Ultimately a total of four modules will be created and disseminated, two each at the introductory and majors-levels. GETSI is working in tight partnership with the Science Education Resource Center’s (SERC) InTeGrate project on the module development, assessment, and dissemination to ensure compatibility with the growing number of resources for geoscience education. This will allow for an optimized module development process based on successful practices defined by these earlier efforts.",

Most, if not all, of these eruptions have in common the paradoxical coexistence of (1) eruptive styles which are inferred to be sustained in nature (subplinian and plinian), with (2) a pulsatory behavior displayed by the resulting fall deposits, and (3) the coeval ejection of vesicular tephra and pyroclastic obsidian. Through two case studies, we explore this apparent set of paradoxes, and their significance in understanding transitions from explosive to effusive behavior.\nIn this second case study (also cf. Shea et al., same session), we present new field, textural and geochemical data pertaining to the 114ka Pu’u Wa’awa’a trachyte eruption in Hawai’i. This large volume (>5 km3) event produced both a tephra cone (~1.6 km in diameter) and a thick (>250 m) lava flow, which have been largely covered by the more recent basaltic Mauna Loa and Hualalai lava flows. The trachyte tephra contains juvenile material displaying a large textural variety (pumice, scoria, obsidian, microcrystalline trachyte and banded-clasts), which can be linked with the extent of degassing and the formation of feldspar microlites. Notably, the abundance of microlites can be used to reconstruct an ascent and devolatilization history that accounts for all the seemingly contradictory observations.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have documented variation in skeletal structure and carbonate mineralogy across a broad range of marine invertebrate taxa. Intraspecific changes in growth, morphology, and carbonate composition may occur in response to local and global changes in temperature, carbonate saturation state, and nutrient availability. Recurring upwelling along the west coast of the United States creates an alongshore mosaic of Ocean Acidification (OA), which may induce plastic responses and/or select for adaptive skeletal construction that can withstand pCO2 and temperature changes. Calcifying bryozoans provide a unique study system for investigating carbonate precipitation under variable conditions. Using a newly constructed flow-through CO2 control apparatus, we tested whether three laboratory-reared populations of the bryozoans Membranipora serrilamella, M. tuberculata and Celleporella cornuta showed differences in growth, calcification, and skeletal composition in response to simulated future OA conditions. Under elevated pCO2 (1200 μatm), bryozoans showed no significant differences in growth rate (new zooids added) compared to clones reared under current atmospheric values. However, C. cornuta colonies raised under high CO2 were significantly lighter, with less carbonate per zooid compared to colonies grown in present-day conditions (400 μatm). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that elevated pCO2 led to dissolution of bryozoan skeletons, which did not occur at 400 μatm. Structural changes in M. tuberculata and C. cornuta colonies may be related to the dissolution of high magnesium calcite skeletal components. Analyses of bryozoan morphological responses along with environmental proxies (δ13C, δ18O, and Mg/Ca ratios) could yield high resolution records of temperature and pH, which could be used to help reconstruct environmental variation along the California coast.",

            "abstract": "One of the most spectacular features of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica is the Vanda Dikes, an exceptionally well exposed swarm of >600 Cambro-Ordovician dikes emplaced near the end of the Ross Orogeny. Whereas their compositions range from mafic to felsic, they are primarily bimodal, with few intermediate compositions between 56 and 66 wt.% SiO2; mafic dikes vary from calc-alkaline to shoshonitic. The suite of dikes exhibits 87Sr/86Sr from 0.704-0.711 and 143Nd/144Nd from 0.51217-0.51242; the wide range of Nd isotopic ratios may reflect variable degrees of assimilation of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle inherited during Proterozoic crustal generation and the Ross Orogeny. The mafic dikes have a subduction-related trace element signature and we propose they originated as melts of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The siliceous suite is characterized by elevated 87Sr/86Sri and an average Nd model age (τDM) of 1444 Ma, suggesting that the silica-rich dikes were generated by melting of or contamination by a Neoproterozoic crustal source, followed by variable fractional crystallization and further continental crust contamination. Analysis of zircons by CA-TIMS U-Pb geochronology reveals that the dikes were emplaced in a narrow time window, from 491 to 495 ± 0.3 Ma, which falls between emplacement of a synorogenic pluton (DV1) and extension-related plutons (DV2). Thus, we conclude that the dikes were intruded during the transition of the Ross Orogeny from collision to extension. During orogenic uplift and collapse, decompression melting of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was initiated, resulting in the emplacement of the Vanda Dike Swarm. Because there is a strong correlation between dike age and latitude, the dikes can be used to map the progress of the collision-extension transition during the Ross Orogeny across the Dry Valleys.",

            "abstract": "Dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR), where ferric iron (Fe3+) is reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+) anaerobically, is an important respiratory pathway used by soil bacteria. DIR contributes to carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from the wet sedge tundra biome in the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) in Alaska, and could competitively inhibit the production of methane, a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, from arctic soils. The occurrence of DIR as a dominant anaerobic process depends on the availability of substantial levels of Fe3+ in soils. Siderophores are metabolites made by microbes to dissolve Fe3+ from soil minerals in iron deficient systems, making Fe3+ soluble for micronutrient uptake. However, as the ACP is not iron deficient, siderophores in arctic soils may play a vital role in anaerobic respiration by dissolving Fe3+ for DIR. We studied the effects of direct siderophore addition to arctic soils through a field study conducted in Barrow, Alaska, and a laboratory incubation study conducted at San Diego State University. In the field experiment, 50μM deferroxamine mesylate (a siderophore), 50μM trisodium nitrilotriacetate (an organic chelator) or an equal volume of water was added to isolated experimental plots, replicated in clusters across the landscape. Fe2+ concentrations were measured in soil pore water samples collected periodically to measure DIR over time in each. In the laboratory experiment, frozen soil samples obtained from drained thaw lake basins in the ACP, were cut into cores and treated with the above-mentioned compounds to the same final concentrations. Along with measuring Fe2+ concentrations, CO2 output was also measured to monitor DIR over time in each core. Experimental addition of siderophores to soils in both the field and laboratory resulted in increased concentrations of soluble Fe3+ and a sustained increase in Fe2+concentrations over time, along with increased respiration rates in siderophore-amended cores. These results show increased DIR in siderophore treated cores compared to the other treatments. From the results of these experiments, we conclude that arctic soil microbes can use siderophores to maintain a pool of dissolved Fe3+ for DIR. This study provides insight into the mechanisms of DIR in this ecosystem, and has relevance for understanding anaerobic soil respiration in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge for spaceborne observations of ocean color is to correct for atmospheric scattering, which typically contributes ≥85% to the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance and varies substantially with aerosols. Ocean color missions traditionally analyze TOA radiance in the near-infrared (NIR), where the ocean is black, to constrain the TOA atmospheric scattering in the visible (VIS). However, this procedure is limited by insufficient sensitivity of NIR radiance to absorption and vertical distribution of aerosols, and by uncertainties in the extrapolation of aerosol properties from the NIR to the VIS.\nTo improve atmospheric correction for ocean color observations, one needs to change the traditional procedure for this correction and/or increase the aerosol information. The instruments proposed for the Pre-Aerosol, Clouds, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission include ultraviolet and Oxygen A-band observations, as well as multispectral and multiangle polarimetry, to increase the aerosol information content. However no studies have been performed on whether such observations contain sufficient aerosol information, and on how to use this information, to substantially improve atmospheric correction.\nTo study the atmospheric correction capabilities of PACE-like instruments, we are conducting field experiments off the Coast of California to obtain high-altitude airborne and in-situ observations of water-leaving radiance. The airborne data sets consist of hyperspectral radiance between 380-2500 nm by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, and narrow-band multiangle polarimetric data between 410-2250 nm by the Research Scanning Polarimeter. We discuss the quality of and comparisons between these data sets, and their differential sensitivities to variations in aerosol properties and ocean color.",

During this time, restoration efforts have focused progressively on avoidance of jeopardy for three threatened or endangered species: interior least tern (Sternula antillarum), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), and the pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). In 2013, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Missouri River stakeholders (through the Missouri River Recovery Implementation Committee) commissioned an Effects Analysis (EA; Murphy and Weiland, 2011) to evaluate the effects of this effort on the three species’ populations and to project effects of future restoration. The EA includes synthesis of existing abiotic and biotic scientific information relating to species population processes, distributions, and habitat needs, as well as development of conceptual and quantitative models linking river context to its management and to species’ responses. The EA also includes design of the next generation of hypothesis-driven science to support adaptive management of the species and the river. The Missouri River EA faces the challenge of evaluating how management of North America’s largest reservoir storage system, 600 km of non-channelized mainstem, and nearly 1,200 km of channelized mainstem contribute to species’ population dynamics. To support EA needs, the US Army Corps of Engineers is developing a new generation of reservoir simulation and routing models for the Missouri River basin, coupled with components to evaluate ecological and socio-economic metrics. The EA teams are developing coordinated models relating management to functional habitats and species’ responses. A particular challenge faced by the EA is communicating the very different uncertainties in population dynamics between well-documented birds and the enigmatic fish, and the implications of this disparity in decision making, implementation, and adaptive management strategies.",

Specifically, Aporrectodea rosea and Amynthas agrestis had the greatest Hg concentrations (0.9 ± 0.1) and Hg amounts (8 ± 2) μg m-2. Aporrectodea rosea and Amynthas agrestis were found to inhabit the forest floor and the top 5 cm of the mineral horizons in high abundance, potentially making it a readily accessible prey species. Bioaccumulation of Hg by invasive and exotic earthworms may be an important mechanism that transfers Hg to ground foraging predators, such as thrushes, red-backed salamanders and foxes, which is generally unaccounted for in terrestrial food chains. Earthworm Hg concentrations were poorly correlated with their respective soil Hg concentrations, suggesting a species dependence for Hg bioaccumulation rather than site effects.\nWe observed that forest floor Hg concentrations and amounts were 23% and 57% lower, respectively, at soil pits with earthworms compared to those without. Moreover, Hg amounts in forest floor-feeding earthworms exceeded the remaining forest floor Hg pools. Mercury concentrations and pools in the mineral soil were 21% and 33% lower, respectively, for soil pits with earthworms compared to those without. We hypothesize that enhanced decomposition, horizon disturbance and bioaccumulation by earthworms has decreased Hg amounts in the forest floor and mineral soil. Our results suggest that earthworms are decreasing Hg storage in forest soils with potential hazardous impacts for predatory animals in northeastern US forests and other ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of leaf waxes, such as n-alkanes, have extensively been used in paleoenvironmental studies for reconstruction of the past vegetation, climate and carbon cycling. There is however little information available on the seasonal variation of leaf wax concentration and δ13C in modern plants and when the δ13C signal is set. This lack of information confounds interpretations of leaf wax δ13C in sedimentary archives. To address this gap, this study investigates temporal changes in n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid δ13C values in several species (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum, Ulmus Americana, Sassafras albidum, and Juniperus virginiana) within a single temperate deciduous forest stand in southern Ohio. We sampled atmospheric air, buds, leaves, leaf litter, and surface soil weekly during leaf flush and biweekly thereafter. In A. rubrum, A. saccharum, and U. Americana, buds had one or two dominant n-alkanes, such as C29 and C31. After leaf flush, the concentrations of shorter n-alkanes (C23~C27) significantly increased relative to the longer chain-lengths. We are currently analyzing remaining samples from the growing season and are analyzing bulk leaf and leaf wax (n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids) δ13C values. This information will be important for identifying environmental and physiological controls on leaf wax δ13C and will improve interpretations of leaf wax δ13C preserved in the geologic record.",

            "abstract": "The scale effect of the friction law is crucial in connecting field observations, laboratory experiments, and natural fault behaviors. Here we present our recent study towards understanding of the scale effect of the friction law.\nThe fault friction law is usually studied in laboratory experiments for cm-scale specimens, and one of the prominent problems is its direct applicability to the large-scale behavior. Small repeating earthquakes (repeaters) may be a realization of heterogeneous frictional property on faults, which were modeled by rate-weakening patches embedded in a rate-strengthening fault [e.g., Chen and Lapusta, 2009]. After the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, so many repeaters were found in the Tohoku subduction zone [e.g., Kato and Igarashi, 2012]. But it is quite difficult to numerically resolve them in a large-scale simulation of the whole subduction zone, which is demanded for potential disaster mitigation. Then, it is important to investigate a spatiotemporally coarse-grained friction law of a fault region including unstable inclusions. We hypothesized that each point on a fault obeys the cm-scale friction law (the rate-state friction law in the aging law formulation) with sub-mm state evolution distance L, and assumed a rate-weakening circular patch (80 m diameter) which generates repeating events. We set 256 m periodicity along the fault, and conducted dynamic earthquake sequence simulations [e.g., Liu and Lapusta, 2009] by driving the system by far field stress τ0. We did not prescribe the long term slip rate by setting a region of constant slip rate as is done in previous studies. Those simulations can be seen as numerical friction experiments with controlling the shear stress and observing the slip rate.\nThe macroscopic steady-state can be explained by a logarithmic law, with the frictional resistance slightly smaller and the rate-dependency slightly more rate-strengthening than the spatial average. The transient behavior on a step in τ0 can be explained by the aging law with significantly longer L and smaller a- and b-values. The optimum parameters are different for different amount of the stress step, indicating that the macroscopic friction law takes a different form from the aging law. Effects of high velocity weakening efficient within the rate-weakening patch has been also investigated.",

            "abstract": "Impact cratering is a violent process, shattering and melting rock and excavating deep-seated material. The resulting scars are apparent on every planetary surface across our Solar System. Subsurface density variations associated with the resulting impact structures contain clues to aid in unlocking the details of this process. High-resolution gravity fields, such as those derived from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, are ideal for investigating these density variations. With gravity measurements from GRAIL and topography from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), we derived high-resolution Bouguer gravity fields (i.e., the gravity field after the contribution from topography is removed) that we correlated with craters mapped from LOLA data. We found that the mass deficit beneath lunar impact craters relates directly to crater size, up to diameter ~130 km, whereas craters larger than this diameter display no further systematic change. This observation, coupled with the greater depth of impact damage expected beneath larger craters, indicates that some process is affecting the production and/or preservation of porosity at depth or otherwise altering the mean density beneath the larger craters (note, measurable mantle uplift is observed for craters larger than ~184-km diameter). The observed crater gravity anomalies, however, exhibit considerable variation about these mean trends, suggesting that other factors are also important in determining the bulk density of impact crater structures. Milbury et al. (this conference) have demonstrated that pre-impact crustal porosity strongly influences the resulting density contrast between the impact damage zone beneath a crater and its surroundings. Herein, we extend these studies using the same GRAIL- and LOLA-derived maps to further investigate the effects that crustal properties have on the bulk density of the rock beneath lunar impact features. We focus, in particular, on the processes that influence the generation and preservation of porosity beneath complex craters 100–150-km in diameter.",

            "abstract": "The growing economic damage incurred by U.S.-landfalling hurricanes is arguably due to a mixture of changing hurricane activity with climate change, increased wealth and population exposure along the coast, and changes in vulnerability to landfall events. Considering the multiple contributing factors, we aim to develop a U.S. hurricane economic damage model and connect the climate effects on hurricanes to the resulting expected economic damage. First, we normalize total damages by an estimate of economic exposure, the wealth of the effected counties. This allows us to focus on the relationship between the physical storm landfall attributes and damage. The normalized quantity is called the Damage Fraction. Second, the record of U.S. hurricane economic damage from 1900-2012 is analyzed using a peaks-over-threshold approach in which the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is applied to model the probability distribution of Damage Fraction extremes. Two covariates are incorporated into the GPD model to represent multiple hazards, the normalized maximum sustained wind at landfall and the bathymetric slope at the landfall location. The latter represents storm surge risk. The former, which is the storm maximum wind normalized by the local 100-year return period wind from the ASCE 7-10 wind map, serves to incorporate a proxy for regional vulnerability, or resilience.\nThe new GPD model is applied to datasets of synthetic hurricane tracks downscaled from 20th century and future (RCP 8.5 scenario) CMIP5 model climates using a statistical-deterministic hurricane model. Using Monte Carlo Simulations, it is shown that across the range of six different CMIP5 model inputs, there is an expected increase of annual Damage Fraction in the future climate. Then we test possible effects of varying levels of future national adaptation by increasing the 100-year return period wind by 5, 10, and 20%. Using the future hurricane climatology, it is shown that the adaptation can help reduce the expected annual Damage Fraction. In one case, adaptation reduces the Damage Fraction even lower than the 20th century climate expectation.",

            "abstract": "Since 2000, the technological advances of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the United States have led to a dramatic increase in hydrocarbon (gas and oil) production from shale formations, changing the energy landscape in the US and worldwide. Since 2005, the surge in tight oil production from shale formations has provided tremendous optimism regarding future United States hydrocarbon production, unexpectedly becoming the fastest-growing frontier of unconventional resources. According to the Energy Information Administration’s newly released report in 2014, US oil output from tight oil prospects will almost double from the 2012 level of 2.5 million barrels per day, to 4.8 by 2019. However, total gas recovery from the Barnett play was reported to be only12–30%, and the tight-oil recovery rate from shale formations is even lower at 5–10%. The main barrier to sustainable development of US shale, the pore structure of the nanopores storing and transporting hydrocarbons, has been quietly ignored.\nWe have studied pore structure, edge-accessible porosity, and how wettability is associated with mineral and organic kerogen phases, from four complementary tests: vacuum saturation with vacuum-pulling on dry shale followed with tracer introduction, tracer diffusion into fluid-saturated shale, fluid and tracer imbibition into partially-saturated shale, and Wood's metal intrusion followed with SEM imaging and elemental mapping. The first three tests use tracer-bearing fluids (API brine or n-decane), with tracer distribution on shale mapped with micro-scale laser ablation-ICP-MS analyses. These innovative approaches indicate the limited accessibility (several millimeters from shale sample edge) and connectivity of nanopores in shales under atmospheric condition, which is linked to the steep initial (e.g., 1st year) decline and low overall recovery because of the limited connection of hydrocarbon molecules in the shale matrix to the stimulated fracture network.",

            "abstract": "Fertilizer use is rapidly increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, we currently have little understanding of the consequences of increased nitrogen (N) fertilizer use on surface and groundwater resource quality in these tropical croplands. This is because there are few field studies that examine N dynamics in SSA, and extrapolation is difficult because soil biogeochemistry and land management differ from the regions where most of our understanding of N losses from agriculture has been developed. We present data on N leaching losses in the vadose zone from a high-clay soil in western Kenya and a low-clay soil in mid-western Tanzania. Experimental fields were established in both sites with fertilizer rates ranging from 0 to 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1. We combine measuring soil pore water concentrations from tension lysimeters with a variably saturated hydrologic flow model to estimate N leaching losses under different fertilizer scenarios in two soil types. Vertical N fluxes are given at the soil surface, within, and below the root zone. We find N losses from high-clay soils to be nearly two orders of magnitude lower than low-clay soils likely due to lower fluid flux and higher anion exchange in the high-clay soils. Organic material additions (from leguminous tree prunings) reduced N leaching losses substantially in low-clay soils likely by changing the timing of N-release and by increasing soil organic matter (and thus improving water retention and the formation of soil aggregates). Predicting the fate of added N in SSA is very important as N application is poised to increase in this vulnerable and under-studied region.",

            "abstract": "Luni-solar gravitational forcing drives the Earth’s body-tide response over periods ranging from 8 hours to 18.6 years, a timespan that extends far beyond the seismic band. A finite volume numerical study of body tides in the semi-diurnal (SD) band by Latychev et al. (2008; EPSL) demonstrated that aspherical density and elastic structure inferred from seismic tomography perturbed the radial crustal displacement response by ~1 mm, a level at which they can be observed with modern space-geodetic inferences of body tide signals (Yuan et al., 2012; EPSL). Thus, site-specific estimates of the body-tide response to the known luni-solar forcing potentially provides a new, independent and powerful method for probing long-wavelength, deep mantle structure. To this end, we have used advances in seismic free oscillation theory to derive a new normal mode treatment of the SD body tide response of an aspherical, rotating and anelastic Earth. The accuracy of the theory is demonstrated by benchmarking our body tide predictions against both finite volume treatments of aspherical structure and previous theoretical and observational constraints on the effects of anelasticity. We begin by summarizing these results, as well as a series of synthetic tests that indicate that the body tide response is particularly sensitive to long wavelength, deep mantle structure – a sensitivity that is ideal for investigating the elastic and density structure of the two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that exist below the Pacific and southern Africa. Finally, we also present results from a first tidal analysis of the integrated density of the LLSVPs and discuss the implications of these results for the ongoing debate concerning the relative size of thermal and chemical effects on these structures, their net buoyancy and longevity.",

This is in sharp contrast to the destructive effects of the 1972 earthquake in the capital city of Managua. The differences in damage stem from the fact that in 1972, the earthquake occurred on a fault beneath the city; in contrast, the 2014 event lies offshore, under Lake Managua. The distribution of aftershocks shows two clusters of seismic activity. In the northwestern part of Lake Managua, an alignment of aftershocks suggests a southeast trending fault. The reported source mechanism suggests right-lateral strike slip motion on a plane with the same azimuth as the aftershock sequence. A second cluster of seismic activity occurred simultaneously, but spatially separated, beneath Apoyeque volcano. There is no clear alignment of the epicenters in this cluster. Seismic scaling relations between magnitude and the fault length predict a length of approximately 10 km for an earthquake of this magnitude. This is in agreement with the extent of the fault defined by the aftershock sequence. The northeast - southwest trending Tiscapa and Ciudad Jardín faults that broke during the 1972 and 1931 Managua earthquakes are orthogonal to the fault where the 10 April earthquake occurred. This set of conjugate faults confirms that Central Nicaragua is being deformed in a complex tectonic style of deformation. The forearc sliver between the trench and the volcanic arc moves to the northwest relative to the Caribbean plate. This deformation, however, does not take place on a single set of faults. The motion is apparently accommodated by a system of conjugate faults: right lateral, strike-slip faults oriented parallel to the volcanic arc and another set of faults trending northeast - southwest, on which the slip is left lateral. The presence of this complex geometry of conjugate faults highlights the seismic hazard not only in the capital city of Managua, but also to the major Nicaraguan cities, all lying close to the volcanic arc.",

            "abstract": "The intermittent nature of strain at geological faults is a consequence of the loss of rigidity of the gouge. Due to the granular nature of the gouge, we take insight from granular physics in order to characterize the role of gouge in the generation of seismic events. In static granular packings, the loss of rigidity has been observed to be associated with an excess in low-frequency vibrational modes. The same holds true in both molecular and colloidal glasses, suggesting that excess low-frequency vibrational modes are a general feature in the failure of disordered solids. Therefore, we seek a relationship between these low-frequency modes and spatiotemporal patterns of failure by studying an experimental analog to a geological fault. Specifically, we measure the acoustic emissions from jammed, quasi-2D granular packings under shear. We use a split-bottom annular shear geometry, driven with a linear-ramp torque in order to generate stick-slip behavior, and observe intervals of both periodic and aperiodic slip. We investigate how low-frequency emissions are associated with both local and global slip events of various magnitudes and directions. Twelve piezoelectric acoustic receivers, an imaging system, and high-resolution stress/strain sensors enable direct comparison of acoustic properties as the system approaches failure. The use of photoelastic grains enables local measurement of changes to the internal stresses.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor hydrothermal systems feature intricate interconnections among oceanic, geological, hydrothermal, and biological processes. The advent of the NEPTUNE observatory operated by Ocean Networks Canada at the Endeavour Segment, Juan de Fuca Ridge enables scientists to study these interconnections through multidisciplinary, continuous, real-time observations. The multidisciplinary observatory instruments deployed at the Grotto Mound, a major study site of the NEPTUNE observatory, makes it a perfect place to study the response of a seafloor hydrothermal system to geological and oceanic processes.\nIn this study, we use the multidisciplinary datasets recorded by the NEPTUNE Observatory instruments as observational tools to demonstrate two different aspects of the response of hydrothermal activity at the Grotto Mound to geological and oceanic processes. First, we investigate a recent increase in venting temperature and heat flux at Grotto observed by the Benthic and Resistivity Sensors (BARS) and the Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar (COVIS) respectively. This event started in Mar 2014 and is still evolving by the time of writing this abstract. An initial interpretation in light of the seismic data recorded by a neighboring ocean bottom seismometer on the NEPTUNE observatory suggests the temperature and heat flux increase is probably triggered by local seismic activities. Comparison of the observations with the results of a 1-D mathematical model simulation of hydrothermal sub-seafloor circulation elucidates the potential mechanisms underlying hydrothermal response to local earthquakes. Second, we observe significant tidal oscillations in the venting temperature time series recorded by BARS and the acoustic imaging of hydrothermal plumes by COVIS, which is evidence for hydrothermal response to ocean tides and currents. We interpret the tidal oscillations of venting temperature as a result of tidal loading on a poroelastic medium. We then invoke poroelastic theories to estimate the crustal permeability, a fundamental property of subsurface hydrothermal circulation, from the phase shift of the tidal oscillations of venting temperature relative to ambient ocean tides. These results together shed light on the influences of seismic and oceanic processes on a seafloor hydrothermal system.",

            "abstract": "As does Earth, Mars presents pronounced global atmospheric circulation patterns. Solar differential heating drives mean meridional overturning (Hadley) circulations which are deep and intense, are hemispherically asymmetric, and where a cross-equatorial single cell dominates. Within middle and high latitudes, thermally indirect eddy-driven (Ferrel) circulation cells have been indicated. Differently, however, large-amplitude orography on planetary and continental scales on Mars can force very non-Earth-like hemispheric circulation patterns. Recent observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, \"Mars Color Imager\" (MARCI) instrument are utilized that emphasize water ice clouds in ultra-violet (UV) wavelengths, and these measurements have been binned into \"daily global maps\" (DGMs) of water-ice cloud optical depth. The presence of large-scale, extratropical quasi-stationary atmospheric wave disturbances in middle and late winter of the northern hemisphere have been found to be present in such DGMs. In combination with such observations, a full-physics Mars global climate model (NASA ARC marsgcm 2.1) is applied to place the observations into context. During late northern winter, it is found that strong, forced Rossby modes (i.e., planetary waves) exist, and with direct correlation to column-integrated cloud opacity undulating spatial patterns. At this season, zonal wavenumber s = 2 dominates (in contrast to wavenumber s = 1), consistent with MGS/TES analyses at this particular season (Banfield et al., 2003). Large-scale, planetary waves dictate the \"coherence\" of the northern polar vortex. Fundamentally, such forced planetary waves influence the polar vortex's impermeability (wave-induced) to tracer transport (e.g., dust and water-ice aerosol) and temporal mean water vapor spatial variations. The large-scale dynamical features of such planetary waves will be highlighted and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate precipitation uncertainty and to understand its impact on flood estimation, toward to further improve the accuracy of a real-time Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS,\nhttp://flood.umd.edu/\n). We investigate the precipitation uncertainty impacts on streamflow calculations through the Dominant river tracing-Routing Integrated with VIC Environment (DRIVE) model (the core of the GFMS) with a set of real precipitation products. These precipitation products include satellite-based, ground radar based, gauge based and reanalysis (with gauge data) based precipitation estimations. There are significant differences in the mean annual, seasonal, and IFloodS period precipitation estimation among the existing precipitation products. To estimate the bias in each precipitation products, a “reference” of mean annual precipitation was created. The simulated streamflow was compared to the observation, while the upstream basin-area-averaged mean annual precipitation at each location with USGS gauge observation was derived to compare with the “reference”.\nThe sensitivity of the DRIVE model performance in reproducing streamflow to precipitation inputs, clearly showed that better precipitation inputs (with less bias) tend to result in better streamflow simulations. This indicates better accuracy of the GFMS is expected when improved satellite-based real-time precipitation products are available through the GPM in near future. Real-time Satellite-based precipitation resulted in overall lower model performance scores than the conventional precipitation products and gauge-adjusted remote sensing precipitation estimations. However, the lower scores are mainly attributed to the inconsistency of precipitation estimation in a few extreme events. While precipitation bias mainly contributes to the over/underestimation of the flood magnitude, the DRIVE model tends to lead to faster flood waves for relatively larger floods in downstream part of the Iowa and Cedar River basin. Model calibration or a better representation of the overbank flow (for floodplain) is expected to further improve the flood timing estimation.",

            "abstract": "Stresses resulting from time-varying tidal forces have been advocated as a primary driver of tectonism on icy satellites in orbits with sufficient eccentricities. Diurnally varying tidal stresses can cause both dextral and sinistral shear during one orbit, presumably contributing to fault initiation and propagation in the icy shell. Observed strike-slip structures indicate the occurrence of mode II shearing; however, the role of bidirectional cyclic shear in fault initiation and development is poorly constrained. To more fully understand the kinematic evolution of faults as a consequence of diurnal bidirectional shear, we perform a set of analog experiments. We use a tectonic apparatus to induce cyclic bidirectional shear in unconsolidated heterogeneous sand, which has similar material properties (i.e., a Coulomb material) to ice when scaled. Using a suite of initiation directions and offset ratios (with a subsequent suite of net offsets), we perform experiments with dry sand and repeat with wet sand (10 wt. %) overlain by dry sand. Our results indicate that, regardless of the offset ratio, after only 1-2 cycles bidirectional shear results in the development of linear (dry sand) to curvilinear (wet/dry sand) fault traces with topographically low damage zones and high fault-flanking ridges. We consider that such ridges may be analogous to those found on Europa and Enceladus. Initial fault-flanking ridges are discontinuous, as is observed for some younger faults on Europa. After additional cycles, ridges mature into more continuous fault-flanking features, suggesting a possible granular mechanical origin for ridges on icy satellites. The rate of ridge maturation is dependent on displacement per offset and net offset per cycle. Experiments with larger displacements per offset, as well as those with net offset, result in more rapid ridge maturation. By utilizing estimated fault displacements and net offsets per orbital cycle (based on existing mechanical models), and assuming ridge formation is a mechanical process as our model suggests, we may infer tentative lower limits for the orbital ages of ridged faults on icy satellites. We compare our model results to a variety of features on Europa, the icy satellite displaying the most diverse expressions of deformation, and find geomorphic and structural similarities.",

            "abstract": "The Jaramillo subchron was the normal polarity period before the present Brunhes chron. However, the Jaramillo’s duration was only 10% as long as the Brunhes. Lasting only about 70 ka, the Jaramillo has frequently been missed (or is missing) from many magnetostratigraphic studies of the Early Pleistocene. We have examined two internally-drained basins with high sediment accumulation rates, that also contain Sanidine-bearing tephras. At Kit Fox Hills, in the Death Valley Basin, we sampled across 50m of tilted (45°) fine-grained sandstone/siltstone. A normal polarity magnetozone was delineated over ~12m of section (sedimentation rate of ~15cm/ka). We also collected 8 tephra beds, 4 of which are within the normal magnetozone, and 2 below and 2 above. To the east is the Tecopa Basin, which until the middle Pleistocene was internally-drained. We sampled through 36m of mudstones between the Tecopa Tuff (1.25 Ma) and the Bishop Tuff (0.77 Ma). A normal magnetozone was delineated over a 9m interval, ending 12.5m below the Bishop Tuff. A Sanidine-bearing tephra (previously unidentified) was found 4m above the base of the Jaramillo zone. There were 2 beds of reverse polarity within the Jaramillo zone, at 4.5m and 8m above the base. At least the lower one has been reported from other continental deposits (China, Spain). These sections should provide precisely calibrated chronostratigraphic tie points (approximately every 10-30 ka), providing sub-precessional level, direct geochronological control through the Jaramillo subchron. These sections are also being examined for paleo-environmental indicators (and minerals) that can be used to determine wetter or drier conditions (expanding saline lakes or dry playas). With all these event horizons (ash falls and polarity shifts), the Jaramillo has the potential to be used for high resolution, paleo-climate reconstructions on a regional scale.",

            "abstract": "Increased surface seawater temperature due to global warming is one of the main causes of coral bleaching, a phenomenon in which corals lose their photosynthetic algae. Light and temperature induced production of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) by these symbiotic algae has been implicated in the breakdown of their symbiotic association with the coral host and subsequent coral bleaching. Nevertheless, a direct link between Symbiodinium ROS production and coral bleaching has not been demonstrated. In fact, given the abundance and diversity of microorganisms within the coral holobiont, the concentration and fluxes of ROS within corals may involve several microbial sources and sinks. Here, we explore the role of increased light and temperature on superoxide production by coral-derived cultures of Symbiodinium algae and Oceanospirillales bacteria of the genus Endozoicomonas, which are globally common and abundant associates of corals. Using a high sensitivity chemiluminescent technique, we find that heat stress (exposure to 34°C vs. 23°C for 2hr or 24hr) has no significant effect on extracellular superoxide production by Symbiodinium isolates within clades B and C, regardless of the level of light exposure. Exposure to high light, however, increased superoxide production by these organisms at both 34°C and 23°C. On the other hand, extracellular superoxide production by Endozoicomonas bacteria tested under the same conditions was stimulated by the combined effects of thermal and light stress. The results of this research suggest that the sources and physical triggers for biological superoxide production within corals are more complex than currently assumed. Thus, further investigations into the biological processes controlling ROS dynamics within corals are required to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning coral bleaching and to aid in the development of mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "A 1-year pilot experiment using pressure-sensor-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIES) was conducted in Sermilik Fjord in eastern Greenland to test non-traditional methods for measuring the time-varying heat content in high-latitude seas, shelves, and fjords and for detecting the presence of ice. PIES, which are installed on the seafloor below the reach of destructive iceberg keels, present a promising and inexpensive way to improve understanding of fjord dynamics and shelf-fjord interactions and will increase long-term monitoring capabilities in high latitudes where remoteness and harsh conditions hamper traditional in situ observation techniques. The use of PIES to characterize variability at high latitudes is a novel application of an existing technology, but rests on the same principle as the traditional blue-water uses for PIES: due to the dependence of sound speed on temperature, the surface-to-bottom round-trip acoustic-travel-time associated with reflections between the PIES and the air-sea interface is an excellent proxy for heat content in the intervening water column. Furthermore, since reflections from seawater-ice interfaces are also detected when ice is present, PIES provide a means to characterize the ice component in high-latitude systems. The PIES deployed in Sermilik Fjord (August 2011 – September 2012) resolved changes in heat content at scales ranging from hourly to seasonal. Furthermore, during winter, the PIES logged about 300 iceberg detections and recorded a 2-week period of land-fast ice cover in March. The deepest icebergs in the fjord were found to have keel depths reaching to ~350 m and iceberg speeds averaged about 0.2 m/s but were as high as 0.5 m/s.",

            "abstract": "Flood prediction and mitigation are important aspects of watershed management, especially in New England where a 30-year upward trend in floods has been attributed to a combination of urbanization and climate change. In addition to urban development, New England is currently experiencing an increase in agricultural land development. The land surface component of gridded hydrology models captures how these land use changes alter elements of the hydrologic cycle, leading to changes in river discharge. In this study, we use a gridded hydrology model (WBM) and a physically based river model (CaMa-Flood) to quantify changes in fluvial regime due to past (1980-2010) and projected future (2010-2050) land use change.\nThe CaMa-Flood model originally has been developed and validated for continental to global scales, accurately modeling discharge and inundation of large rivers. Here, we suggest a methodology incorporating locally available survey data for applying the same model structure to regional studies of past and future flood risk assessments in six New England basins. Locally estimated river geometry parameters using direct measurement results in increased simulation accuracy as validated against USGS in-situ gauged discharge. In sensitivity analysis, we found that accurate calibration of the river geometry parameters is dependent upon the spatial scale of the simulation. In addition to calibrating river geometry parameters, we incorporated direct observational data from field surveys, and compared the resulting flood simulations.",

            "abstract": "Most intra-plate oceanic islands are considered to be expressions of partial melting of hot, ascending mantle plumes. Mantle plume activity is often evident by progressively-aged volcanic island chains, early flood basalts, or elevated mantle temperatures (hot-spots). However, some isolated volcanic islands lack these characteristics. Their mantle sources, causes of melting, and geodynamic settings remain elusive. Here we present petrologic and geochemical data for an example of this type of ocean island: Norfolk Island and neighbouring Phillip Island. These islands are only 7 km apart and are located in the Southwest Pacific. They are the only sub-aerial volcanic islands on the Norfolk Ridge, which extends roughly linearly south from New Caledonia and north from New Zealand. The Norfolk Ridge is a continental slice rifted from the eastern Australian margin during opening of the Tasman Sea and the on-going break-up of Gondwana. There are a few isolated, unexplored volcanic edifices trending NNW from the Norfolk Ridge north of Norfolk Island that may be a hot spot trace. Norfolk and Phillip islands are both composed of young (ca. 2-3 Ma), primitive basalts and basaltic andesites containing abundant phenocrysts of olivine and rare pyroxene and feldspar. Major element systematics are unique among the global spectrum of ocean island basalts, with low CaO, high Al2O3, and high Na/Ti indicating that melting processes and/or the mantle source differs from that of any other OIB. However, Fe/Mn are high, similar to other OIB, and REE patterns carry the typical OIB garnet signature. The highest MgO contents approach 9 wt%. The unusual major-element chemistry results in olivine-dominated crystallization extending to low MgO (ca. 6-7 wt%), hence little increase of incompatible elements with decreasing MgO, but surprisingly Ni and Cr also remain nearly constant with MgO. Isotopic compositions (Sr-Nd-Hf) indicate either a primitive mantle source composition (εNd=6-7), consisting of a pure FOZO end-member or depleted mantle (DMM) contaminated with Norfolk Ridge crustal material. We propose that Norfolk and Phillip Islands are a rare type of OIB that formed via low-degrees of melting of a mantle source unmodified by any of the typical enriched endmembers so often observed in other OIB.",

            "abstract": "During the northern Spring 2014 (April-May), IODP Expedition 350 drilled a 1806.5 m deep hole at Site U1437 in the Izu-Bonin rear arc, in order to understand, among other objectives, the compositional evolution of the arc since the Miocene and track the missing half of the subduction factory. The good recovery of mostly fine grained sediments at this site enables a high resolution paleomagnetic and rock magnetic study. Particularly, variations in magnetic properties and mineralogy are well documented. The onboard magnetostratigraphy established from the study of the archive halves highlighted remagnetized intervals that produced “ghost” repetitions of geomagnetic reversals ~10’s meters below their actual stratigraphic position in specific intervals. Onboard paleo- and rock magnetic analyses showed that remagnetization is probably due to a chemical remanence carried by iron sulfides (putatively identified as greigite). The rock magnetic parameters, SIRM/k and the S-ratio are consistent with the presence of ferromagnetic iron sulfides in Site U1437. A mixture of iron oxides and iron sulfides was found within the sulfate reduction zone, which was identified by onboard pore water analyses at ~50-60 meters below sea floor (mbsf) by a minimum in sulfate (~5 mM) coupled with a maximum in alkalinity. Below 50 mbsf, the sulfate content increases up to ~29 mM at ~460 mbsf. The particular downhole profile of the sulfate content in Site U1437 is probably triggered by fluid circulation. Evolution of sulfate content, pyritization process and fluid circulation are closely linked. Onshore research is focusing on further downhole characterization of the iron sulfides including their abundance, grain size and composition. Routine magnetic properties (NRM, magnetic susceptibility) and rock magnetic analyses at high resolution (every ~20-50 cm), including hysteresis properties and low temperature magnetic measurements, have been conducted on about 400 discrete samples in the first 200 m of Hole 1437B (Cores 1H to 30X). As suggested by the onboard data, hysteresis measurements showed the occurrence of both single domain-pseudo single domain iron oxides and iron sulfides in the sulfate reduction zone. Preliminary results will be compared with the geochemical data.",

            "abstract": "In 1988, the Instituto Geofisico (IG) began a permanent surveillance of Ecuadorian volcanoes, and due to activity on Guagua Pichincha, SP seismic stations and EDM control lines were then installed. Later, with the UNDRO and OAS projects, telemetered seismic monitoring was expanded to Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Cuicocha, Chimborazo, Antisana, Cayambe, Cerro Negro, and Quilotoa volcanoes.\nIn 1992 an agreement with the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificacion strengthened the monitoring of Tungurahua and Cotopaxi volcanoes with real-time SP seismic networks and EDM lines. Thus, background activity levels became established, which was helpful because of the onset  of the 1999 eruptive activity at Tungurahua and Guagua Pichincha. These eruptions had a notable impact on Baños and Quito. Unrest at Cotopaxi volcano was detected in 2001-2002, but waned. In 2002 Reventador began its eruptive period which continues to the present and is closely monitored by the IG.  \nIn 2006 permanent seismic BB stations and infrasound sensors were installed at Tungurahua and Cotopaxi under a cooperative program supported by JICA, which allowed us to follow Tungurahua’s climatic eruptions of 2006 and subsequent eruptions up to the present.   \nPrograms supported by the Ecuadorian Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia and the Secretaria Nacional de Planificacion resulted in further expansion of the IG’s monitoring infrastructure. Thermal and video imagery, SO2 emission monitoring, geochemical analyses, continuous GPS and tiltmeters, and micro-barometric surveillance have been incorporated. Sangay, Soche, Ninahuilca, Pululahua, and Fernandina, Cerro Azul, Sierra Negra, and Alcedo in the Galapagos Islands are now monitored in real-time.\nDuring this time, international cooperation with universities (Blaise Pascal & Nice-France, U. North Carolina, New Mexico Tech, Uppsala-Sweden, Nagoya, etc.), and research centers (USGS & UNAVCO-USA, IRD-France, NIED-Japan, SGC-Colombia, VAAC, MIROVA) has introduced the use of new technologies and methods.  An agreement with the Secretaria de Gestion de Riesgos fortifies the communication flow to society, officials, and risk managers.  Today the IG has the challenge of offering real-time information through a web-based net of virtual observatories.",

            "abstract": "The Round Top Mountain peraluminous rhyolite, exposed at the surface in Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth County, west Texas, USA, is enriched in yttrium and heavy rare earth elements (YHREEs). Other potentially valuable elements in the deposit include Be, Li, U, Th, Sn, F, Nb, and Ta. Texas Rare Earth Resources Corp. proposes to extract the YHREEs from the host mineral variety yttrofluorite by inexpensive heap leaching with dilute sulfuric acid, which also releases some of the Be, Li, U, F, and Th from other soluble minor minerals.\nData: Feldspars and quartz comprise 90-95% of the rhyolite, with pheonocrysts of up to 250 microns set in an aphanitic matrix that hosts the typically sub-micron target yttrofluorite. Reverse circulation cuttings from some 100 drill holes, two drill cores, and outcrop and trench observations suggest striking physical homogeneity through this billion-plus ton surface-exposed laccolith, about 1200 feet high and a mile in diameter (375 x 1600 m). Gray to pink, and other minor hues, color variation derives from magnetite—hematite redox reaction.\nPlots of Y, 13 REEs, U, Th, and Nb analyses from over 1500 samples collected from 64 drill holes (color codes in figure) exhibit remarkably little variation in the concentration of these elements with geographic position or depth within the laccolith.\nImportance: Uniform mineralization grades help insure against the mining production surprises often associated with vein deposits and heterogeneous open pit deposits. At Round Top, mine feedstock can be relatively constant over the life of the mine (multiple decades), so the mechanical mining process can be optimized early on and not need expensive alterations later. Likewise, the chemical and physical parameters of the heap leach can be perfected. The sensitive and expensive process of extraction of elements and element groups from the pregnant leach solution and purification also can be optimized.\nOrigin: The remarkable homogeneity of the YHREE distribution through the laccolith suggest YHREE and associated mineralization from a late-stage fluorine vapor generated within the magma in situ, rather than from injection of a F-rich fluid from an external source. The micron-scale cavities that produce up to 5% original porosity in the rhyolite may be nano-analogues of the cavities associated with granite pegmatites.",

            "abstract": "During the peak of the Millennium Drought (1997-2010) pool-levels in the lower River Murray in South Australia dropped 1.5 metres below sea level, resulting in large-scale mass failure of the alluvial banks. The largest of these failures occurred without signs of prior instability at Long Island Marina whereby a 270 metre length of populated and vegetated riverbank collapsed in a series of rotational failures. Analysis of long-reach bathymetric surveys of the river channel revealed a strong relationship between geomorphic and hydraulic controls on channel width and downstream alluvial failure. As the entrenched channel planform meanders within and encroaches upon its bedrock valley confines the channel width is ‘pinched’ and decreases by up to half, resulting in a deepening thalweg and channel bed incision. The authors posit that flow and shear velocities increase at these geomorphically controlled ‘pinch-points’ resulting in complex and variable hydraulic patterns such as erosional scour eddies, which act to scour the toe of the slope over-steepening and destabilising the alluvial margins. Analysis of bathymetric datasets between 2009 and 2014 revealed signs of active incision and erosional scour of the channel bed. This is counter to conceptual models which deem the backwater zone of a river to be one of decelerating flow and thus sediment deposition. Complex and variable flow patterns have been observed in other mixed alluvial-bedrock river systems, and signs of active incision observed in the backwater zone of the Mississippi River, United States. The incision and widening of the lower Murray River suggests the channel is in an erosional phase of channel readjustment which has implications for riverbank collapse on the alluvial margins. The prevention of seawater ingress due to barrage construction at the Murray mouth and Southern Ocean confluence, allowed pool-levels to drop significantly during the Millennium Drought reducing lateral confining support to the over-steepened channel margins triggering large-scale riverbank failure.",

More recently, several studies have suggested that soil dusts having higher contents of soil organic matter (SOM) may also contribute significantly to atmospheric ice nucleation. In this study, we examine the ice nucleation properties of soil dusts derived from different locations in the world. Our results show that the ice nucleating ability of agricultural soil dusts derived from the largest dust source regions in North America is almost comparable to that of desert soil dusts at temperatures colder than about −15°C. We also confirm that the agricultural soil dusts can serve as effective ice nuclei (IN) at much warmer temperatures. On the other hand, our results indicate that the ice nucleating ability of the agricultural soil dusts is significantly reduced after H2O2 digestion, while the reduction is not significant for the desert soil dusts. In this regard, based on single particle analysis, we demonstrate that such a significant reduction observed in the agricultural soil dusts is mainly attributable to the removal of organic-rich particles (namely, SOM particles), which have much higher ice nucleating ability than mineral particles. Moreover, we discuss the potential contributions of these soil dusts to atmospheric IN populations.",

Recently, there has been interest in simulating lateral exchange of surface and subsurface water, as the grid resolution of ESMs increases (currently towards ~20 km) due to advances in computational power.\nIn the current work, we present a new physically-based hydrological model capable of simulating lateral flow at a hyperresolution (1 km pixels) coupled with the vertical soil column of the Community Land Model (CLM), which has a much coarser resolution. Our new approach also uses sub-pixel topographic information to represent small scale lateral-flow processes. As input to our model, we use 1 km data of required surface and subsurface information, such depth to bedrock, hillslope width functions, fractional coverage of hillslopes/wetlands/riparian zones within each 1 km pixel, and a river network. Such data are largely derived from higher-resolution (30 m) topographic data, and will be made available to the community as global products.\nWe have tested our model against measurements over a well instrumented, artificial hillslope at the University of Arizona’s Biosphere 2 and found that both our approach and a full 3-D physically-based hydrological model can realistically simulate hydrological states and fluxes. However, computationally, our approach is 2 – 3 orders of magnitude faster than the latter. We are currently testing it for an ESM grid box that covers much of southeastern New York State, which includes the headwaters of the Delaware River, the Susquehana River, and parts of the Mohawk River Basin. Our approach improves upon the 1-D hydrological representation in CLM by representing the subgrid topographic and geomorphological variability in the grid box. The impact of representing such subgrid variability on surface water and energy fluxes will be discussed in our presentation.",

            "abstract": "Peak global warmth during the early Eocene is a partial analog to the future structure of marine ecosystems in a high pCO2 world. Early Eocene oceans are generally regarded as supporting warmer oceans with lower overall productivity than today owing to the low concentrations of preserved organic matter in pelagic sediments. It has also been proposed that Eocene oceans were about as productive as now, but higher respiration rates in a warmer-than-modern ocean more efficiently recycled organic matter and nutrients. We investigated Eocene export productivity and its link to taxonomic diversity using the pelagic ichthyolith record. Ichthyoliths are calcium phosphate microfossils including fish teeth and shark denticles and their fragments, and are a unique paleoceanographic proxy because they represent a fossil record for marine vertebrates, a charismatic and tangible part of the ecosystem that generally goes unrepresented in the fossil record. Analysis of the ichthyolith record in Ocean Drilling Program Site 1258 (NE South America) shows a remarkable increase in accumulation rate of ichthyoliths from the Paleocene into the Eocene, suggesting that onset of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum in the equatorial Atlantic was favorable to fish production. Our results suggest that, if anything, the early Eocene maintained higher productivity than in the late Paleocene. These results compare favorably with a record of ichthyolith accumulation in the South Pacific (DSDP 596), which also indicates unusually high rates of fish productivity in the peak of Eocene warm climates. Low resolution data sets from the Pacific suggest an explosion of morphotypes during the warm period associated with an increase in ichthyolith mass accumulation rates. Peak global warmth, therefore, appears to be associated with both higher fish production and higher taxonomic diversity than suggested by previous reconstructions of Eocene primary production.\nIncreasing the amount of continuous records of ichthyoliths and identifying morphotypes will improve our understanding of the pelagic community in deep time and specifically its response to global climate change, which will in turn inform us about fish evolution through time and their potential response to anthropogenic climate forcings.",

            "abstract": "Due to extreme weather conditions and remoteness to access, the great part of the Southern Ocean remains to be explored. Therefore, little is known about the Circum-Antarctic Ridge (CAR) system and its hydrothermal vent ecosystem underlying the Southern Ocean. We report the first discovery of a new deep-sea hydrothermal vent field and a new anomuran species from the Australia-Antarctic Ridge (AAR), the highest latitude (62°S; 158°E) explored in the Southern Ocean up to date. At this site, a new anomuran species which belongs to the genus Kiwa known as ‘yeti crabs’ was found. Morphologically, this species has characteristics of the genus Kiwa, including fifth pereopod inserted below sterna plastron, third sternite strongly produced anteriorly, and eyes extremely reduced. However, the new species differs from the other known species of Kiwa, K. hirsuta and K. puravida, showing relatively short rostrum and slender dactylus on second to fourth pereopods. Phylogenetic analysis using DNA sequences of eight genetic loci also supported the result of morphological analysis, confirming this species as a new Kiwa species, Kiwa n. sp. In addition, phylogenetic tree revealed the evolutionary relationship among the Kiwa species, presenting the Kiwa n. sp. as the sister species to K. puravida which inhabits the methane cold seep on the Pacific continental slope off Costa Rica. Considering the geography and the physicochemical environment, this unlikely result casts a mystery to be solved through further taxon sampling particularly from as-yet-unexplored vents and seeps. Discovery of the hydrothermal vent and Kiwa n. sp. from the AAR segment is significant because this site is located in the high latitude of the southern hemisphere and it is the region affected by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Future research on the relation of Kiwa n. sp. and the other Kiwa species affected by the ACC will provide an idea about the biogeography and the evolutionary connections of the vent faunas in the CAR system.",

Common among these are “throw-away” approaches, often yielding more complex problems then those attempted to solve. Personal change can be expressed via deepening sense of context and purpose, extending beyond concerns for self. Incarceration often exacerbates a thirst for new meaning-making, highly relevant to both criminal and ecological rehabilitation.\nPrimary field data was gathered from incarcerated men, with a focus on the Insight Garden Program in San Quentin State Prison. A mixed method was used, with open-ended qualitative interviews and three established multiple-choice survey instruments: an environmental literacy quiz; a Locus of Control test (a psychological survey measuring one’s sense of self-agency); and the “Six Americas” survey instrument, which stratifies responses of climate change opinion.\nTwo control groups in the same unit were included in the study: inmates taking other programs but not gardening, and inmates in no programming at all. This research explores patterns in the ways people come to terms with personal moral obligation, as well as how restorative ecological engagement may be transformational for humans in personal crisis.\nParticipants described prison programming in general as contributing profoundly to personal transformation. Beyond that, programming with a strong ecological focus offered vocational, intellectual, emotional and even spiritual change, which in turn has been shown to aid in reducing recidivism rates.\nGiven a sample size of 58 participants total, the 174 surveys conducted were not primarily intended to achieve statistical significances but augment the overall perspective, for individuals, or for groups. Some correlations of significance were observed, however, between control groups, survey data, and with general US population data.\nMost intriguing, analysis of the qualitative interview data yielded patterns of progressive change in personal and/or ecological relationship.\nThese survey results and compelling dialogues illustrate the degree to which prison programming experiences have profoundly expanded and nurtured participants’ healthy relationships to self, fellow humans, and our communities, including our larger shared ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Fire managers at various levels require near-real-time, low-cost, systematic, and reliable early detection capabilities with minimal latency to effectively respond to wildfire ignitions and minimize the risk of catastrophic development. The GOES satellite images collected for vast territories at high temporal frequencies provide a consistent and reliable source for operational active fire mapping realized by the WF-ABBA algorithm. However, their potential to provide early warning or rapid confirmation of initial fire ignition reports from conventional sources remains underutilized, partly because the operational wildfire detection has been successfully optimized for users and applications for which timeliness of initial detection is a low priority, contrasting to the needs of first responders.\nWe present our progress in developing the GOES Early Fire Detection (GOES-EFD) system, a collaborative effort led by University of California-Davis and USDA Forest Service. The GOES-EFD specifically focuses on first detection timeliness for wildfire incidents. It is automatically trained for a monitored scene and capitalizes on multiyear cross-disciplinary algorithm research. Initial retrospective tests in Western US demonstrate significantly earlier identification detection of new ignitions than existing operational capabilities and a further improvement prospect. The GOES-EFD-β prototype will be initially deployed for the Western US region to process imagery from GOES-NOP and the rapid and 4 times higher spatial resolution imagery from GOES-R — the upcoming next generation of GOES satellites. These and other enhanced capabilities of GOES-R are expected to significantly improve the timeliness of fire ignition information from GOES-EFD.",

            "abstract": "The Soundings of Ozone and Water in the Equatorial Region (SOWER) has been accumulating observational evidences of atmospheric dehydration taking place in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) since initiation in 1998. SOWER data successfully characterize the nature of TTL dehydration in which the cold-trap is effectively functioning between 360 K and 380 K isentropes while some moistening taking place before the air parcel reaches 400 K. The first attempts of the TTL water vapor ‘match’ suggest the threshold of nucleation being 146 ± 19 % in relative humidity with respect to ice with the typical dehydration time scale of about an hour in the lower TTL. Simultaneous observations by lidar and Optical Particle Counters near the cold point tropopause reveale cirrus clouds within the aerosol layer composed of liquid phase aqueous sulfuric acid particles. The estimated concentrations of cloud particles and aerosols are not consistent with the interpretation of cloud formation in liquid phase aerosol particles.\n In February 2014, a series of ozone (ECC) and water vapor (CFH) sonde observations was conducted at Biak (1.2oS, 136.1oE) collaborating with LAPAN, Indonesia. The sea surface temperature in the western tropical Pacific showed positive anomalies. The convective activities were relatively low in the eastern Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent, while an eastward propagation of active convection associated with intraseasonal oscillation was observed. This campaign was not simply an extension of the previous ones, but was intended to provide correlative data for ATTREX/CONTRAST/CAST aircraft campaigns. Unfortunately the coordination did not run as originally intended. A sequence of independent sonde data, however, may provide some useful information for airborne observations. This paper presents an overview of the project and introduces the highlights of the findings obtained.",

Scientific riser drilling, with coincident control over drilling mud, downhole pressure, and returning drilling mud analyses, has now been in use aboard the scientific riser drilling vessel Chikyu since 2009. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 348, as part of the goal of reaching the plate boundary fault system near ~5000 mbsf, has now extended the deep riser hole (Hole C0002 N & P) to 3058.5 mbsf.\nThe mud gas data discussed here are from two approximately parallel boreholes, one a kick-off from the other; 860-2329 mbsf (Hole C0002N) and 2163-3058 mbsf (Hole C0002P). An approximate overlap of 166 m between the holes allows for some slight depth comparison between the two holes. An additional 55 m overlap at the top of Hole C0002P exists where a 10-5/8-inch hole was cored, and then opened to 12-1/4-inch with logging while drilling (LWD) tools (Fig. 1). There are several fault zones revealed by LWD data, confirmed in one instance by coring. One of the defining formation characteristics of Holes C0002 N/P are the strongly dipping bedding planes, typically exceeding 60º. These fault zones and bedding planes can influence the methane/ethane concentrations found in the returning drilling mud.\nA focused comparison of free gas in drilling mud between one interval in Hole C0002 P, drilled first with a 10 5/8-inch coring bit and again with an 12 ¼-inch logging while drilling (LWD) bit is shown. Hole C0002N above this was cased all the way from the sea floor to the kick-off section. A fault interval (in pink) was identified from the recovered core section and from LWD resistivity and gamma. The plot of methane and ethane free gas (C1 and C2; ppmv) shows that the yield of free gas (primarily methane) was greater when the LWD bit returned to open the cored hole to a greater diameter. One possible explanation for this is the time delay between coring and LWD operations; approximately 3 days passed between the end of coring and the beginning of LWD (25-28 December 2013).",

            "abstract": "In wind energy applications the turbulent velocity field of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) is often characterised by Gaussian probability density functions. When estimating the dynamical loads on wind turbines this has been the rule more than anything else.\nFrom numerous studies in the laboratory, in Direct Numerical Simulations, and from in-situ measurements of the ABL we know, however, that turbulence is not purely Gaussian: the smallest and fastest scales often exhibit extreme behaviour characterised by strong non-Gaussian statistics.\nIn this contribution we want to investigate whether these non-Gaussian effects are important when determining wind turbine loads, and hence of utmost importance to the design criteria and lifetime of a wind turbine.\nWe devise a method based on Principal Orthogonal Decomposition where non-Gaussian velocity fields generated by high-resolution pseudo-spectral Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of the ABL are transformed so that they maintain the exact same second-order statistics including variations of the statistics with height, but are otherwise Gaussian. In that way we can investigate in isolation the question whether it is important for wind turbine loads to include non-Gaussian properties of atmospheric turbulence. As an illustration the Figure show both a non-Gaussian velocity field (left) from our LES, and its transformed Gaussian Counterpart (right). Whereas the horizontal velocity components (top) look close to identical, the vertical components (bottom) are not: the non-Gaussian case is much more fluid-like (like in a sketch by Michelangelo). The question is then: Does the wind turbine see this?\nUsing the load simulation software HAWC2 with both the non-Gaussian and newly constructed Gaussian fields, respectively, we show that the Fatigue loads and most of the Extreme loads are unaltered when using non-Gaussian velocity fields. The turbine thus acts like a low-pass filter which average out the non-Gaussian behaviour on time scales close to and faster than the revolution time of the turbine. For a few of the Extreme load estimations there is, on the other hand, a tendency that non-Gaussian effects increase the overall dynamical load, and hence can be of importance in wind energy load estimations.",

            "abstract": "Development in coastal tropical watersheds (especially unpaved roads) has led to increased turbidity and runoff of land-based sediment into coastal bays with coral reefs. Unlike other threats to coral reefs, land-based sedimentation can be managed locally through sound watershed management practices. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of watershed restoration projects or track how future watershed building or changing climate affect land-based sedimentation, it is necessary to adapt monitoring approaches that will effectively capture marine sediment dynamics at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.\nSince 2007 we’ve monitored rainy-season sedimentation (tube sediment traps) and turbidity (TSS) (26-day intervals) in eastern St. John, USVI. More recently (2013-14) we added SedPods and a program of terrestrial-marine integrated monitoring including shoreline runoff (stream and crest gauges) and current meters and nephelometers, which measure sediment deposition, turbidity, and hydrographic parameters at minute resolution. Our 15 shoreline and reef sites are below developed and undeveloped “reference” watersheds and ARRA-funded watershed restoration projects completed in 2011. Through examples from our study, we will compare monitoring approaches and share lessons learned.\nOur sediment trap data resolved greater mean terrigenous accumulation below developed compared to undeveloped watersheds, increases in terrigenous accumulation in response to storm events, and reductions in terrigenous accumulation following watershed restoration during storms. However, they lacked the temporal resolution to capture the sedimentary response to ephemeral runoff or re-suspension events. They also dampen short-term acute sedimentation events that have the greatest impact on coral condition. Based on our studies, we recommend: a) monitoring over periods which capture the natural variability of the system; b) combining time-averaged approaches (long term [core], gross [sed. traps] and net [SedPods] deposition) that provide sample material, with high temporal-resolution instrumentation (nephelometers and current meters); c) integrated monitoring of the watershed-bay-coral reef by an inter-disciplinary team of experts working together; and d) community participation.",

            "abstract": "Disaster-causing natural hazards such as floods, erosions, earthquakes or slope failures were particularly observed to be concentrated in certain geographical regions. In the Asia-pacific region, coastal ecosystems were suffering because of perennial threats driven by chronic fluctuations in climate variability (e.g., typhoons, ENSO), or by dynamically occurring events (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis). Among the many people that were found prone to such a risky condition were the ones inhabiting near the coastal areas. Characteristically, aside from being located at the forefront of these events, the coastal communities have impacted the resource by the kind of behavioral patterns they exhibited, such as overdependence and overexploitation to achieve their wellbeing. In this paper, we introduce the development of an approach to an assessment of the coupled human- environment using a multi- agent simulation (MAS) model known as Coastal Vulnerability Dynamic Simulator (COVUDS). The COVUDS comprised a human- environmental platform consisting multi- agents with corresponding spatial- based dynamic and static variables. These variables were used to present multiple hypothetical future situations that contribute to the purpose of supporting a more rational management of the coastal ecosystem and their environmental equities. Initially, we present the theoretical and conceptual components that would lead to the development of the COVUDS. These consisted of the human population engaged in behavioral patterns affecting the conditions of coastal ecosystem services; the system of the biophysical environment and changes in patches brought by global environment and local behavioral variations; the policy factors that were important for choosing area- specific interventions; and the decision- making mechanism that integrates the first three components. To guide a future scenario-based application that will be undertaken in a coastal area in the Philippines, the components of the model will be presented within a platform following a parameterized architecture.",

            "abstract": "The basic physics of a glacier's response to small perturbations in climate forcing is of longstanding and intrinsic interest in glaciology, and it is also of some applied importance for predicting future glacier change and for inferring the climate history that drove past glacier fluctuations. In order to understand the fundamental parameters governing glacier advance and retreat, and also the spectral properties of fluctuations in glacier length in response to noisy weather, we examine outputs of a numerical flowline model solving the shallow-ice equations with sliding. The numerical results reveal a surprising simplicity: the time evolution and spectral shape of glacier\nexcursions depend on a single parameter, a time constant determined by the geometrical properties of the glacier. Furthermore, the numerical results reveal that perturbations in mass balance over the glacier surface set in motion a sequence of events that can be roughly described as occurring in three overlapping stages: (1) changes in interior thickness drive (2) changes in terminus flux, which in turn drive (3) changes in glacier length. A simple, third-order linear differential equation, which extends previous models in the literature, successfully captures these important features of the glacier flow. This three-stage linear model is readily invertible to recover climate history. It provides clear physical insight and analytical expressions for some important metrics of glacier behavior, such as variance, sensitivity and excursion probabilities. Finally, it facilitates uncertainty analysis. The linear model can also be\nadapted for arbitrary catchment geometry, and is applied to Nigardsbreen, Norway.",

            "abstract": "The spectacular lightning strokes observed during eruptions testify to the enormous potentials that can be generated within plumes. Related to the charging of individual ash particles, large electric fields and volcanic lightning have been observed at Eyjafjallajokull, Redoubt, and Sakurajima, among other volcanoes. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for plume electrification, including charging from the brittle failure of rock, charging due to phase change as material is carried aloft, and triboelectric charging, also known as contact charging. While the first two mechanisms (fracto-emission and volatile charging) have been described by other authors (James et al, 2000 and McNutt et al., 2010, respectively), the physics of tribocharging--charging related to the collisions of particles--of ash are still relatively unknown.\nBecause the electric fields and lightning present in volcanic clouds result from the multiphase dynamics of the plume itself, understanding the electrodynamics of these systems may provide a way to detect eruptions and probe the interior of plumes remotely. In the present work, we describe two sets of experiments designed to explore what controls the exchange of charge during particle collisions. We employ natural material from Colima, Mt. Saint Helens, and Tungurahua.\nOur experiments show that the magnitude and temporal behavior of ash charging depend on a number of factors, including particle size, shape, chemistry, and collisional energy. The first set of experiments were designed to determine the time-dependent electrostatic behavior of a parcel of ash. These experiments consist of fluidizing an ash bed and monitoring the current induced in a set of ring electrodes. As such, we are able to extract charging rates for ash samples driven by different flow rates. The second experimental setup allows us to measure how much charge is exchanged during a single particle-particle collision. Capable of measuring charges as small as 1 fC, this device allows us to methodically to characterize charges on particles with diameters down to 100 microns. Employing this instrument, we quantify the effect of particle pre-charging, mineralogy, and impact energy on the charge exchange between two colliding particles.",

Global Lightning and Sprite Measurements from ISS is a mission to observe lightning and sprite from CMOS camera, Photometer, VLF and VHF interferometeric measurements as a part of the multi-mission consolidated equipment on Japanese Exposure Module. In this mission, CMOS cameras measure the optical emissions from sprite at 762 nm and lightning at 740-830 nm in order to discriminate lightning and sprite signals. Photometeric measurements at six channels (150-280 nm , 337+/-5 nm, 762+/-5 nm, 600-900 nm, 316+/-5 nm, 392+/-5 nm) also provide information on the detection and identification of sprite and lightning process. From these measurements, global distribution of sprite has been derived and some implications to discriminate ground and cloud flashes from space borne platforms are presented. VLFR measurements on GLIMS adds information on the charge moment of the parent lightning based on the whistler wave of the VLF waves that the lightning generates. While VLF observation does not locate the sources of the radiation, VLFR serves an important role as a bridge in coupling the occurrence of TLEs to lightning. The VHF measurements consists of two antennas and from this observation with photometric measurements, location of VHF emission from lightning from space station was successful for the first time. In this presentation, mission overview and some scientific results are briefly summarized using these equipments.",

            "abstract": "A recent ecosystem carbon sequestration assessment estimated that the conterminous United States (CONUS) stored 48.3 Pg of carbon, or 6.14 Kg of carbon per square meter covering all vegetated as well as arid lands in the 48 states. The CONUS is shown to be a strong C sink with an average rate of 431 Tg of carbon up-take per year (ranging from 148-667 TgC/yr) for the first half of 2000s as a baseline. Dissolved carbon transported through aquatic systems and emitted carbon dioxide from water surfaces averaged 142 Tg per year. Emissions from wildfires averaged 14 Tg per year based on a separate analysis using remotely sensed fire areas and burn severities. Wildfires are simulated under future climate scenarios and are projected to increase in area, intensity and emissions in future years. Under combinations of future land use/land cover change and climate scenarios, the net ecosystem carbon balance is projected to remain as a carbon sink for the CONUS but could become weaker by 2050 as compared to the baseline, ranging from 44-579 TgC per year. However, a separate analysis of the assessment noted that future potential rate of carbon sequestration by CONUS ecosystems could be higher (increasing to 503-676 Tg of carbon per year by 2060, depending on climate scenarios) than the present rate. This assumes the ecosystems would be managed with active fire suppression, maintained for natural vegetation cover, and benefited from increased water use efficiency of increased atmosphere carbon dioxide concentration.",

            "abstract": "The complex nature of turbulence produced by the interaction between plant canopies and atmospheric surface layer winds has been a challenge for the development of reduced-complexity models. The drag force exerted by the canopy elements on the flow field produces profound modifications on the turbulence structure and on the mechanisms of momentum transport. These changes can be characterized by the distribution of sweeps and ejections and can be linked to the skewness of the velocity fluctuation distribution. Second-order closure approaches for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations yield good predictions for the mean velocity and the turbulence kinetic energy components, but do not include predictions for the skewness of the velocity fluctuation distributions. In this work we adapt a one-dimensional turbulence model to study of canopy flows. The model is based on a one-dimensional version of the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. In the model, the resolved nonlinear and pressure terms are represented by stochastic eddy events, which are implemented as simple mappings. The canopy drag and viscous effects are represented explicitly. The subgrid-scale stresses are parameterized using an eddy-viscosity approach. The resulting equations are solved numerically. Vertical profiles of statistics produced by the model compare reasonably well with experimental data for crops and forests. The model is capable of capturing the main features of the skewness of the streamwise velocity. The model is also extended to study scalar transport within the canopy region. Preliminary results and potential uses of the model are discussed.",

Some uncertainties about forest cover maps still exist in China, so an accurate and updated forest cover distribution map is necessary as a baseline for carbon cycle estimation, especially at a fine spatial resolution. In this study, we developed a decision tree classification algorithm to identify forest and non-forest land cover, based on the signature analysis of 50 m ALOS PLASAR backscatter data in 2010 for a few land cover types. We used MODIS-based NDVI dataset in 2010 (MOD13Q1) to generate a map of annual maximum NDVI and used it to mask out built-up lands, barren lands, and sparsely vegetated lands. We applied the PALSAR-based algorithm and produced a forest cover map in China in 2010. Several comparisons in forest area and spatial distribution between the resultant forest map with other forest maps were carried out. The results show that the total forest area in China from the PALSAR-based forest map in 2010 is close to those of JAXA, FAO FRA, and National Forestry Inventory, and there are good linear relationships between the PALSAR-based forest map with the JAXA, MCD12Q1, and NLCD-China forest areas at province and county scales. All the forest maps have similar forest/non-forest distribution, but our PALSAR-based forest map recognizes well the agro-forests. The results of this study provide a baseline map of forest cover in China in 2010, which can be used for the studies of forest disturbance, carbon cycle, and ecological restoration projects in China.",

            "abstract": "Ganymede's atmosphere is a surface-bounded-exosphere composed mainly of molecular oxygen. The bulk density of the O2 atmosphere is inferred from the diagnostic ratio between far-UV auroral emission line brightnesses observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but this measurement is relatively uncertain owing to a lack of information available for the energies of the electrons in Ganymede's magnetosphere that dissociatively excite the OI 130.4 nm and 135.6 nm emissions. Only a few other species such as H have been detected, and the abundance of atomic oxygen has been constrained only in relation to lower limits for the O2 density based on the line ratios. The New Horizons (NH) spacecraft observed Ganymede with the Pluto-Alice (P-Alice) instrument during the Jupiter flyby in spring of 2007. HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) far-UV images of Ganymede complement the P-Alice far-UV spectroscopy at this time. OI 130.4 nm and 135.6 nm emissions were detected in both data sets. The ACS Ganymede images are consistent with previous Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) imaging. P-Alice observed two Ganymede eclipse events, viewing the sunlit sub-Jupiter and nightside anti-Jupiter hemispheres, separately, from before ingress through after egress. Through comparisons of the P-Alice spectra in sunlight to those in eclipse we are able to disentangle the component of the OI 130.4 nm emission line brightness attributed to processes other than electron impact dissociation of O2, namely a combination of solar reflectance and solar resonant scattering by atomic oxygen atoms. The CII 133.5 nm solar emission feature in the sunlit hemisphere dataset also disappears in eclipse and was not detected in the nightside hemisphere spectra, as expected, providing distinct fits to the solar reflectance component. We thereby provide the first meaningful constraint on the atomic oxygen atmosphere revealed through the solar resonant scattering emission source. We briefly discuss the potential of similar far-UV measurements with the upcoming Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) for better understanding Ganymede’s atmosphere and auroral interaction processes.",

            "abstract": "During the winter months in São Paulo, Brazil, particulate matter and black carbon were monitored using a Dust Trak (TSI model 8533), a Black Carbon monitor (MAAP-Thermo) and a PM2.5 sampler (Partisol-Thermo). The concentrations were obtained every 5 minutes, from June to August 2014, for the first and second and every 12 hours for the third. The experiment took place in a site at the University of São Paulo which is located in the Southeast part of the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP). MASP is one of the biggest urban centers of the world, with more than 20 million inhabitants, 10 million vehicles and high values of some regulated pollutants, as particulate matter, especially in winter. Ambient fine particles associated with vehicle emissions have been linked to adverse health effects. Black carbon has a significant share of particulate mass concentrations. Previous studies showed a contribution of more than 30% for São Paulo. This year the climate was atypical in São Paulo. The summer was the driest of the last 30 years. The winter was hot and also dry. Dust trak monitor showed peaks of more than 120 μg/m3 for PM2.5. For a specific period, black carbon concentrations from the MAAP monitor were compared to black carbon measured by optical reflectance on teflon filters collected by the Partisol sampler. Monitor values were around 30% higher, but specific characteristics can influence this value. In the past, optical reflectance and thermal techniques for black carbon were compared. The reflectance technique showed higher results for the fine fraction than the thermal method. Now, reflectance is being compared to instrument measurements and results are also satisfactory.",

            "abstract": "Organic aerosol (OA) comprises a large fraction of atmospheric fine particulate matter, impacting air quality and climate. Climate change is expected to impact the primary emission and the secondary production of OA, as well as its transport and removal in the atmosphere. However, it is extremely difficult to quantify these impacts or to validate the model predictions of such. Here we diagnosed the sensitivity of surface OA to the interannual variability of meteorological variables over North America. We used a chemical transport model, driven by assimilated meteorology and current-best emission estimates, to simulated surface OA during 1990-2013 and compared the results against observations from the IMPROVE dataset. Observations show large interannual variabilities in surface OA concentrations, as well as its sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, and regional wind. The model underestimates surface OA concentration over the eastern U.S. The model reproduces the observed correlation between surface OA and temperature, but severely underestimates the sensitivity of surface OA to temperature. This implies that a future warming climate will lead to greater surface OA concentration increases than currently predicted.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of structural motions during large earthquakes is important to prevent secondary disasters. To evaluate such strong motion as accurately as possible, it is essential to infer the image of ground motion in the target area based on densely installed seismological networks. In the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan, the dense seismological array “MeSO-net” was established in 2007, and has approximately 300 stations with several kilometer intervals. Mizusako et al. (2014, AGU) applies lasso, which is a linear regression modeling method using the L1 regularization, to the MeSO-net data during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake to infer the spatially-high-resolution strong motions in the metropolitan area. Their method succeeds in reproducing the waveforms up to much higher frequency component than previous studies. However, there are two topics to deal with before practical use of their study. The first topic is that real azimuths of MeSO-net seismometers installed after 2009 have not been verified, while those installed in 2007 and 2008 were already verified based on cross correlation with nearby tiltmeters of Hi-net and/or seismometers of F-net (Shiomi et al., 2009). Since azimuths of seismometers obviously affect the data processing, we evaluate the azimuths of seismometers following Shiomi et al. (2009). The second topic is that we cannot directly obtain the ground motion data on surface since MeSO-net seismometers are installed at 20m depth. We have been also developing the method to estimate transfer functions that convert strong motion at 20m depth to that on surface, by utilizing continuous observations obtained both on surface and at 20m depth at two stations, and short-term observations obtained above the boreholes at more than 100 stations. A combination of this vertical transformation method and the horizontal estimation method (Mizusako et al., 2014), enables us to infer an image of ground motions in the whole Tokyo area.",

            "abstract": "Cities are increasingly important drivers in altering global biogeochemical cycles. Yet, we still have a limited understanding of the magnitudes and patterns of carbon profile in urban areas. The modelling of carbon profile enables the determination of the interactions between urban systems and natural ecosystems. In this study, we develop a systems approach to accounting for both economic and natural sources and sinks of carbon emissions. We quantify the carbon emissions associated with each economic sectors and household consumers and assess how these emissions changes with different climatic and socio-economic conditions between urban systems. In addition, the relationship between ecosystem services and carbon emissions is analyzed. The case study of a set of major global cities indicates that the value of ecosystem services has a negative correlation with carbon emissions. We argue that the modelling of urban carbon profile is vital not only for guiding cities towards more effective actions towards reducing carbon footprint, but also for looking into the changing ecosystem function and services in urban systems during urbanization.\nKeywords: carbon emissions, ecosystem services; urbanization; global cities",

            "abstract": "Middle to Late Holocene age, horizontally laminated clays and muds of lacustrine origin predominate the uppermost layers of the valley-fill sequence deposited in the lower Murray River’s bedrock gorge upstream of the set of lakes which separate Australia's largest river system, The Murray-Darling, from its discharge point to the Southern Ocean. The top surface of the Coonambidgal Formation muds is developed at a constant elevation approximately coincident with the Holocene sea-level maximum and the mud deposit thins progressively in thickness upstream from ~30 m to ~10 m over a distance of 150 km due to a gradual, upstream rise in the elevation of the unit's base. Radiocarbon ages for wood and charcoal fragments recovered from two cores indicates the uppermost four to five metres of these muds were deposited after the mid-Holocene sea-level maximum, at below sea-level elevations indicating that the discharge of the Murray-Darling fluvial system was contained and effectively dammed by an obstruction developed downstream of Lake Alexandrina where the present-day river mouth is located. This feature is suspected to be the precursor of the present-day dune and beach-barrier system which occasionally blocks the river mouth and diverts fresh-water flow into the Coorong Wetlands. Muddy sediment from the entire Murray-Darling catchment was effectively trapped in the lower Murray Gorge palaeolake, herein named Lake Mannum, during the mid to late Holocene. High rates of sedimentation (one to two meters per thousand years) produced exquisitely fine-scaled (1 mm to 1 cm) laminations in the upper Coonambidgal Formation. This material has not been disturbed by bioturbation and presents a sediment record with the potential to yield a high-resolution record of the Murray-Darling catchment’s discharge for much of the Holocene. The present-day lower Murray River channel currently presents a meandering but constant planform geometry upstream of Lake Alexandrina that developed as a thalweg incised and entrenched within the Coonambidgal muds, as a somewhat delayed response to the two metre fall in sea-level after the mid-Holocene maximum. The onset of this incision apparently occurred towards the end of the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "For several years, the University of Costa Rica, NASA Centers (e.g., JPL, ARC, GSFC/WFF, GRC) & NASA contractors-partners have made regular in situ measurements of aerosols & gases at Turrialba Volcano in Costa Rica, with aerostats (e.g., tethered balloons & kites), & free-flying fixed wing UAVs (e.g., Dragon Eye, Vector Wing 100, DELTA 150), at altitudes up to 12.5Kft ASL within 5km of the summit. Onboard instruments included gas detectors (e.g., SO2, CO2), visible & thermal IR cameras, air samplers, temperature pressure & humidity sensors, particle counters, & a nephelometer. Deployments are timed to support bimonthly overflights of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard the NASA Terra satellite (26 deployments to date). In situ observations of dilute plume SO2 concentrations (~1-20ppmv), plume dimensions, and associated temperature, pressure, & humidity profiles, validate detailed radiative transfer-based SO2 retrievals, as well as archive-wide ASTER band-ratio SO2 algorithms. Our recent UAV-based CO2 observations confirm high concentrations (e.g., ~3000ppmv max at summit jet), with 1000-1500ppmv flank values, and essentially global background CO2 levels (400ppmv) over distal surroundings. Transient Turrialba He detections (up to 20ppmv) were obtained with a small (~10kg) airborne mass spectrometer on a light aircraft—a UAV version (~3kg) will deploy there soon on the UCR DELTA 500. Thus, these platforms, though small (most payloads <500gm), can perform valuable systematic measurements of potential eruption hazards, as well as of volcano processes. Because they are economical, flexible, and effective, such platforms promise unprecedented capabilities for researchers and responders throughout Central and South America, undertaking volcanic data acquisitions uniquely suited to such small aircraft in close proximity to known hazards, or that were previously only available using full-sized manned aircraft. This work was carried out, in part, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology under NASA contract.

            "abstract": "Floods in large river basins are not the simple result of heavy rainfall; rather it is the confluence of the spatio-temporal pattern of single to multiple rainfall events, antecedent moisture conditions, and the river network. Increasing the routing model resolution can improve modeled flood peak, volume and duration; however this can be computationally intensive. We use a high-resolution river routing model coupled to the VIC land surface model over the Ohio and Danube Rivers, both of which are large, flood-prone river basins. Using detailed river channel data from across the Ohio River basin to parameterize the river routing model, we demonstrate that channel width parameters can be transferred to the Danube River, providing a potential strategy for implementing high-resolution models in data-poor regions. Spatial and temporal resolutions at which runoff is generated for the flood model has varying impacts for different sub-basins, and we hypothesize that this is tied to the scale of the flood-generating precipitation events. This modeling framework, which is able to accurately simulate peak flood rate and flood volume, then allows us to explore the relative importance of antecedent moisture conditions and the spatio-temporal pattern of rainfall. We find that working back from the annual maximum flood, we have high correlation with the 7-day runoff preceding the flood event for the Ohio. However starting with the annual maximum 7-day runoff does not necessarily result in a flood, pointing to the importance of considering both the rainfall patterns and river network for flooding in large river basins.",

Such lateral connectors could be formed from reactivated transform faults, transverse faults or lateral ramps. The Zipaquira Anticline (ZA) is a salt-cored structure, with a NE-SW axial axis direction, a clear defined map-view curvature. The Neusa Transverse Zone (NTZ) controls the kinematicof faults and folds. The Zipaquirá Transverse Zone (ZTZ) is located to the southern of the ZA. This transverse zone is a key feature in the area, controlling the ZA and allowing the ascend of diapirs and salt sheets to shallow deeps. Our study was focused on Cretaceous marine sediments and Cenozoic transitional to continental sedimentary sequence around the ZA. 224 oriented cores were collected using a gas portable drill. At each site we collected 10 cores, spaced in order to try to average out secular variation. All samples were oriented using a magnetic compass, corrected to account for the local magnetic field declination. Cores were cut into standard cylindrical specimens and magnetic fabric, rock magnetic and paleomagnetic measurements were done in the shielded room of the paleomagnetic laboratory of in the IAG in the Sao Paulo University. We measured the low-field (AMS) in a Kappabridge (MFK1-FA, AGICO). All samples were thermally demagnetized up to 680°C by a shielded oven, and the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of the specimens was measured. Magnetic mineralogy analyses were carried out to identify and characterize the main magnetic carriers. The ZA is an important example of natural connection between multiple factors controlling deformation and geological evolution. Interaction between salt, transverse zones and folding, the ZA could be considered as a scale model for the Eastern Cordillera. Our goal is related the ZA and the transverse zones using Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and paleomagnetism to unraveal the kinematic evolution of the anticline and the temporal relationship between the transverse zones and the ZA.",

The assessment is made using dense experimental networks of rain gauges deployed at two, 0.25°×0.25°, sites that represent contrasting topographic features: the lowland plain (mean elevation of 719 m.a.s.l.) site and the highland mountain (mean elevation of 2268 m.a.s.l.). The investigation period covers the summer seasons of 2012 through 2014. Compared to the highland mountain site, the lowland plain site exhibits marked extremes of rain intensity, higher rain intensity, lower frequency of rain occurrence, and smaller seasonal rainfall accumulation. All the satellite products considered tend to overestimate the mean rainfall rate at the lowland plain site, but underestimate it at the highland mountain site. The satellite products miss more rainfall at the highland mountain site than at the lowland plain site. The satellite products underestimate the heavy rain rates at both sites. Both sites have uncertainty (root mean square error) values greater than 100% for 3 hour accumulations of less than 5 mm, or daily accumulations of less than 10 mm, and the uncertainty values decrease with increasing rainfall accumulation. Among the satellite products, CMORPH suffers from a large positive bias at the lowland plain site, and TMPA-RP and TMPA-RT miss a large number of rainfall events that contribute nearly half of the total rainfall at the lowland plain.",

            "abstract": "This study describes in brief the development of a new hybrid geoid model, KGEOID12, which can be used as an accurate vertical datum in Korea. The hybrid geoid model is generally determined by fitting the gravimetric geoid to the geometric geoid undulations from GPS/Levelling data which were presented the local vertical level. For developing the gravimetric geoid model, we performed an optimal remove-restore technique based on the earth gravitaional model 2008 (EGM2008) reference surface. In remove-restore technique, EGM2008 model was analyzed up to harmonic degree and order 2,160, 4-band spherical fast fourier transformation (FFT) with modified stokes kernel and residual terrain model (RTM) reduction method were used for calculating the long, middle and short-frequency part of gravimetric geoid, respectively. A number of land and shipborne gravity data were compiled for modelling the middle-frequency part. A digital elevation model (DEM) gridded by 100m×100m were used for short-frequency part. The accuracy of gravimetric geoid model were evaluated by comparison with geometric geoid ontained from all available GPS/Levelling data in Korea which was about ± 0.107 m with a mean value of -0.360 m. Finally, we developed the hybrid geoid model in Korea, KGEOID12, corrected to gravimetric geoid model with a correction term derived from GPS/leveling data. The correction term is modelled using differences between gravimetric and geometric geoidal undulations at 1,185 GPS/Leveling data. The stochastic model used in the calculation of correction term is a least square collocation method based on second-order Markov covariance function. The post-fit error (mean and std. dev.) of the KGEOID12 was evaluated as 0.001 m ± 0.043 m. This result indicated that KGEOID12 can be used as a vertical datum to determine the height information with a few cm-leveled precision by combining a GNSS positioning technique in Korea.",

            "abstract": "Natural range of variability of forest fire frequency is of great interest due to the current changing climate and seeming increase in the number of fires. The variability of the annual area burned in Canada has not been stable in the 20th century. Recently, these changes have been linked to large scale climate cycles, such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phases and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The positive phase of the PDO was associated with the increased probability of hot dry spells leading to drier fuels and increased area burned.\nHowever, so far only one historical timeline was used to assess correlations between the natural climate oscillations and forest fire frequency. To counteract similar problems, weather generators are extensively used in hydrological and agricultural modeling to extend short instrumental record and to synthesize long sequences of daily weather parameters that are different from but statistically similar to historical weather. In the current study synthetic weather models were used to assess effects of alternative weather timelines on fuel moisture in Canada by using Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index moisture codes and potential fire frequency.\nThe variability of fuel moisture codes was found to increase with the increased length of simulated series, thus indicating that the natural range of variability of forest fire frequency may be larger than that calculated from available short records. It may be viewed as a manifestation of a Hurst effect. Since PDO phases are thought to be caused by diverse mechanisms including overturning oceanic circulation, some of the lower frequency signals may be attributed to the long term memory of the oceanic system. Thus, care must be taken when assessing natural variability of climate dependent processes without accounting for potential long-term mechanisms.",

St. Helens and the 2010 flow at Soufrière Hills, Montserrat, display magnetic Curie temperatures (TC) that vary strongly with depth in the flow. We demonstrate that these TC variations result from variable degrees of cation ordering within Mg- and Al-bearing titanomagnetites, and that the degree of ordering is dependent on the emplacement temperature and post-emplacement thermal history of the sample. Curie temperatures are lowest at the tops of flows where rapid cooling has quenched in a relatively low degree of cation order. Samples that cooled more slowly at depth in the flow evolved towards a higher degree of cation order with a correspondingly higher TC. Isothermal annealing experiments in the laboratory have allowed us to document the time-temperature evolution of the cation ordering and Curie temperature, and we use this data in combination with conductive cooling calculations to forward model stratigraphic variations in TC as a function of emplacement temperature (e.g., Fig.1). Preliminary results show that modeled emplacement temperatures (Templ) are reasonably close to measured or estimated emplacement temperatures. Thermal demagnetization data from lithic clasts incorporated into some flows supports the modeled emplacement temperatures; a low-temperature overprint in the direction of the present-day field is removed at ~Templ. However, the documented variation of TC with thermal history means that care should be taken in interpreting this more traditional lithic-based paleomagnetic paleothermometry data. Modification of Curie and blocking temperatures both during natural cooling and during laboratory thermal treatments could affect lithic-based emplacement temperature estimates.",

At the same time, the technical and scientific issues at play from geology and hydrology through ecology and sociology effectively block local citizens from fully understanding and participating in decision-making about their own futures.\nThe Marcellus Community-Based Performance Program engages adult residents, landowners, and local decision makers in knowledge-generating performances made collectively with those most impacted by shale gas development. Unlike traditional proscenium stage theatre, community-based performance is a collaborative means for exploring a collectively significant issue or circumstance. The choice to use a community-based theatre method, which engages the spectators in the performance itself as a way of making meaning, was based on the following goals\nto achieve good debate;\nto engage community participants in discussion through the exchange of ideas, argument and counter-argument, in an effort to further the education of all;\nto facilitate the perspectives of citizens in communities where different responses to the risk issues exist because of local economies and legacies with resource extraction.\nThe plays and performances, developed around the broad theme of Living with Risk and Uncertainty, use existing research, reports, newspaper articles, and interviews to present the range of perceptions, facts, and issues surrounding the environmental risks associated with natural gas drilling and focused on developing scientific understanding.\nPerformances have been assessed by seeking direct feedback from participants through pre-performance surveys, post-performance dialogues (talk-backs), and exit interviews.

In this study, we examined the physical properties of sediments using on-board data and laboratory experimental data on sediments obtained off Costa Rica margin to understand the distribution of compaction states. Target sites are in the Integrate Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 344 off Costa Rica, including reference sites (U1381 and U1414), frontal prism site (U1412), mid-slope site (U1380) and upper-slope site (U1413). Laboratory experiments for velocity and porosity measurements were conducted with variation of effective pressure.\nPorosity ranges from about 80% to about 53% during experiments. P-wave velocity ranges from about 1.4 to about 1.7 km/s. Velocity-porosity relationships from on-board data and from laboratory experiments are comparable nicely. This comparable trend in Vp-porosity relationship suggests that the relationship between porosity and effective pressure can be applied to most of sediments. The porosity-effective pressure curves under isotropic condition were converted to the curves under uniaxial condition (Teeuw, 1971). Using the normal consolidation curves under isotropic and uniaxial stress conditions, we converted the on-board porosity to effective pressure and fluid pressure.\nFor U1381 Unit I, hydrostatic fluid pressure was estimated as expected as a reference site.\nFor U1414 in another reference site, hydrostatic pressure was observed in Unit I, but lower fluid pressure than hydrostatic pressure was estimated in the upper part of Unit II. Below that, the pore pressure returned along hydrostatic pressure. This boundary can be weakened by higher fluid pressure below the boundary, suggesting that this boundary is likely a precursor of decollement.\nFor Unit 1412 in frontal prism, pore fluid pressure is lower than hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that they have lower porosity possibly caused by tectonic stress.\nFor 1380 in mid-slope andU1413 in upper slope, very low fluid pressure is observed. Because there is almost no age difference at the boundary, the extremely low porosity can be caused by rapid sedimentation and erosion on the seafloor or tectonic stress enhanced-dehydration.",

            "abstract": "Scientists, policymakers and science communicators generally work from an assumption that science communication, or ‘outreach’, is good and often work from a primarily practice-based knowledge. Meanwhile, the science, technology and society (STS) community, which is strongly grounded in theory and critical analysis, is critical of certain aspects of science communication, particularly in controversial areas of science. Unfortunately, these two groups rarely speak to each other, and when they do they don’t necessarily understand one another. Much of this confusion relates to different assumptions around the goals of science communication, as well as differing understandings of the various roles and responsibilities in both science and society. The result, unfortunately, is a lack of science communication practice and theory informing each other.\nThis research is a collaboration between a scientist communicator with a positive attitude to outreach, who works in the field of climate change; a political theorist with expertise in public dialogue around biotechnology and has been critical of motivations for engaging the public with science; and a science historian and science communicator who has uncovered surprising and significant changes in public attitudes towards nuclear science and technology in New Zealand. By exploring our understanding of science communication through these diverse disciplinary lenses, and considering three fields of science that are or have been highly controversial for different reasons, we have identified several subtleties in both the politics of communicating different areas of controversial science, and the difficulties of finding a common language across social and physical sciences. We conclude that greater reflexivity about our own roles and assumptions, and increased efforts at enhanced understanding across disciplines, is central to applying the theories in STS to the practice of communication by scientists.",

            "abstract": "Crustal extension in deep levels is usually characterized by localizations of extension strain, i.e., ductile detachment zones. These zones provide available information to insight into timing and mechanisms of crustal extension. Many ductile detachment zones, i.e., master detachments zones of metamorphic core complexes, occur widely across the northeastern section of continental Asia, from Transbaikalia (Russia), to SE Mongolia and to NE China. They are the major features in this province and resulted in the development of one of the largest extensional provinces in the world. This paper summarizes ages and major characteristics of these ductile detachment zones, and use them to constrain the polarity and processes of the deep crustal extension in NE Asia.\nMost Late Mesozoic ductile detachment zones in the Transbaikalia region, Sino-Mongolia border tract, and the northwest-central portion of the North China craton (NCC) show a top-to-the-southeast (SE) shear, whereas those in the eastern and southern NCC locally underwent top-to the-northwest (NW) shear. Our new and published zircon U–Pb ages and Ar–Ar ages of biotite and hornblende for pre- or syn- (mylonitized) and post-kinematic (unmylonitized) intrusions from these detachment zones suggest that the mid-lower-crustal extension probably initiated at ca. 150–145 Ma with a peak occurring 145–130 Ma and continued to 130–120 Ma.\nWe interpret the extension in the Transbaikalia, Sino-Mongolia tract to reflect late-orogenic collapse of thickened crust following Middle-Late Jurassic collision along the Mongol-Okhotsk suture. The southeastward extension is probably controlled by crustal-scale top-to-the-SE tangential shear. The combined effect of gravitational loading and thermal-uplifting is considered to be the origin of the late-or post-orogenic collapse. The top-to-the-NW extension in the NE China might reflect antithetic sub-extensional zones or Mesozoic back-arc extension as a far-field effect of Cretaceous Pacific plate subduction.",

            "abstract": "Nitrophenols play important roles in the atmosphere, for example as light-absorbing organic matter, phytotoxins, precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and HONO. Besides emissions from primary sources, nitrophenols are important secondary products from the oxidation of aromatics in the atmosphere. Nitrophenols were measured along with many other organic acids using an acetate ion (CH3COO-) time of flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (TOF-CIMS) at a site in an oil and gas producing region during Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS) in 2014. Nitrophenol and methyl-substituted nitrophenols exhibited distinct diurnal profiles, with high concentrations at night and a minimum observed during the daytime. This is consistent with photolysis being the dominant sink of these species. For this study, nitrophenols are most likely formed in situ, while primary emissions (e.g. biomass burning, oil and gas emissions) are negligible during this campaign. We will quantify the contributions of gas phase reactions of phenols with OH and NO3 radicals to form nitrophenols. The importance of heterogeneous reactions resulting for nitrophenol formation, including N2O5 chemistry on surfaces and photolysis of nitrate in the snow will be also explored using vertical gradient measurements at two different heights (1.0 m and 18.5 m). In contrast with mono-nitrophenols, dinitrophenol showed a daytime maximum, indicating that the formation of dinitrophenol is driven by photochemistry in the atmosphere.

            "abstract": "Solar energy installations in arid and semi-arid regions of India are rapidly increasing, due to technological advances and policy support. Even though solar energy provides several benefits such as reduction of greenhouse gases, reclamation of degraded land, and improving the quality of life, the deployment of large-scale solar energy infrastructure can adversely impact land and water resources. A major challenge is how to meet the ever-expanding energy demand with limited land and water resources, in the context of increasing competition from agricultural and domestic consumption. We investigated whether water consumption for solar energy development in northwestern India could impact other water and land uses, and explored opportunities to co-locate solar infrastructures and agricultural crops to maximize the efficiency of land and water use. We considered energy inputs/outputs, water use, greenhouse gas emissions and economics of solar installations in northwestern India in comparison to Aloe vera cultivation, a widely promoted land use in the region. The life cycle analyses show that co-located systems are economically viable in some rural areas and may provide opportunities for rural electrification and stimulate economic growth. The water inputs for cleaning solar panels and dust suppression are similar to amounts required for aloe, suggesting the possibility of integrating the two systems to maximize water and land use efficiency. A life-cycle analysis of a hypothetical co-location indicated higher returns per m3 of water used than either system alone. The northwestern region of India is experiencing high population growth, creating additional demand for land and water resources. In these water limited areas, coupled solar infrastructure and agriculture could be established on marginal lands, thus minimizing the socioeconomic and environmental issues resulting from cultivation of non-food crops (e.g. Aloe) in prime agricultural lands.",

Stakeholder needs in the High Plains Region have evolved over time from simple data requests to inquiries about the impacts of various climate-related events. At this time, climate impacts may be reported in numerous locations such as newspapers, scholarly journals, and extension articles. In order to meet the increasing demand for climate impact information, HPRCC is beta-testing an online tool which synthesizes, archives, and displays impacts related to extreme climate events from multiple sources. The tool is intended to fulfill the needs of two general types of users – those who need a place to archive climate impact information and those seeking such information. As such, there are two main components to the tool: 1) a back-end interface where an impact information database is populated and 2) a front-end interface where users may browse the impacts. On the front-end, users can select an area (i.e. river basin, state, county warning area) and search for climate-related impacts within that area. Key impacts include the following sectors: agriculture, ecosystems, energy, human health, society, transportation, and water resources. In this regard, information can also be useful for future National Climate Assessment activities. Ultimately, an understanding of impacts to extreme events by sector will provide critical information for improved decision-making and adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "The Woodlark Basin is one of few places where it is possible to investigate an active transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. The Papuan Peninsula began N-S extension at 8.4 Ma, followed by seafloor spreading at 6 Ma. To date, seafloor spreading has propagated west 500 km. In the proximity of the modern rifting to spreading transition the northern margin has subsided 2-3 km with minor brittle faulting. The southern margin has subsided a similar amount but is characterized by large faults. Previous work shows that the observed continental extension is half the amount resolved by seafloor-spreading kinematics. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to mid-crustal decoupling, where the mantle lithosphere and lower crust are detached.\nThe N-S profile across the current rifting to spreading transition is a natural laboratory for extensional environments. The work herein presented is a continuation of prior studies, but incorporates a new approach to extensional modeling, specifically the use of the Move software package. The profile presented includes ODP Leg 180 wells. Structural and stratigraphic interpretations originate from nearby seismic lines. Biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism data are the basis for age-depth relationships. Interpreted sedimentary packages permit backstripping and decompaction models that assume Airy Isostasy. Extension is estimated through the restoration of fault heaves and back rotation of fault blocks. From previous studies we know the width of the Papuan Peninsula to be 320 km in the vicinity of the profile presented. Furthermore, those studies estimate 220 km of extension across the margin based on Euler pole kinematics. This gives an original margin width of about 100 km, and Beta greater than 3. We present herein an extension estimate based on 2-D kinematic modeling, and contrast this with prior extension estimates of 111-115 km.",

            "abstract": "Mafic sills and lavas of the c. 183 Ma Ferrar Large Igneous Province are assumed to have originated from the same parental magma source with minor differentiation during long-distance transport, storage, and emplacement. However, a brief field study by Marshak et al. (1981) reported that the Butcher Ridge Igneous Complex (BRIC), a ~6000 km3 glassy hypabyssal intrusion in the Cook Mountains of southern Victoria Land, reputed to be a significant magma distribution center within the Ferrar LIP, contains lithologies and structures consistent with a major episode of magma differentiation. At present, based on available data, it remains unclear whether production of compositionally diverse magmas, ranging from 53 to 73 wt. % SiO2, originated purely via fractional crystallization of a parental Ferrar magma(s) or whether crustal contamination, and/or re-melting of granitoid basement played a significant role in driving differentiation. In addition, the timing and duration of BRIC magmatism with respect to the main phase of Ferrar magmatism is debated. Here we present the results of new isotopic, major- and trace-element geochemical analyses for (n=130) BRIC samples that, when combined with detailed petrologic and thermodynamic modeling, delineate the geochemical diversity within the BRIC, and enable detailed comparisons with new and existing data for the remainder of Ferrar LIP. In addition, new high-resolution U-Pb ID-TIMS geochronology on baddeleyite from both the BRIC and Dolerite sills from the Ferrar LIP indicate magmatism occurred over a relatively short time span (<<100ka) and overlaps with the main phase of Ferrar magma emplacement. These data are combined with ongoing geochemical and thermodynamic modeling to develop a petrogenetic model for the BRIC and establish the origins and petrologic significance of silicic magmatism within the Ferrar LIP and other LIPs globally.",

            "abstract": "Climate scientists predict (and have already observed) that in the Northeastern U.S., individual storms may be more intense, and that there will be more precipitation on an annual basis. In steep post-glacial terrain, erosion caused by floodwaters is the largest destructive force during high-intensity storm events, and the force most likely to drive major morphological changes to riverbanks and channels. What remains uncertain is which watersheds or river reaches may be subjected to increased damage from more intense storms. This presents a challenge for scientific outreach and management. Many New England states have developed systems for delineating the potentially geomorphically active zones adjacent to rivers, and Vermont has an excellent assessment and land use management system informed by process-based fluvial geomorphologic science. To date, however, Massachusetts has neither. In this project we survey existing protocols for accurately predicting locations of fluvial erosion hazard, including using LiDAR and DEM models to extract basic morphologic metrics. Particularly in states or landscapes with high river density, and during a time of tight fiscal constraints, managers need automated methods that require a minimum of expert input. We test these methods in the Deerfield river watershed in Massachusetts and Vermont, and integrate our knowledge with that of the basin’s agricultural and floodplain stakeholders. The results will inform development of a comprehensive river assessment and land use management system for the state of Massachusetts.",

The three parameters are the proton specific entropy, the proton Alfven speed, and the proton temperature Tp compared with a velocity-dependent expected temperature. The scheme does not use the time history of the wind nor does it use heavy-ion charge states. The 3-parameter scheme is tested and is found to be more accurate than existing categorization schemes. The categorization scheme is applied to the 1963-2013 OMNI2 data set spanning 4 solar cycles and to ACE. The statistical properties of the 4 types of plasma are examined. The sector-reversal-region plasma is found to have statistically low alpha-to-proton density ratios and high Alfven Mach numbers. The outward-inward imbalance of the solar-wind fluctuations are high in coronal-hole-origin plasma, modest in streamer-belt-origin plasma, very low in sector-reversal-region plasma, and gone in ejecta. The statistical relations between the proton and alpha-particle specific entropies and the oxygen and carbon charge-state density ratios are examined for the four types of plasma: the patterns observed imply a connection at the Sun between sector-reversal-region plasma and ejecta and a connection between streamer-belt-origin plasma and coronal-hole-origin plasma. The magnetic structure and plasma structure of the solar wind for the four different types of plasmas are overviewed.",

            "abstract": "Ecogeomorphic studies have demonstrated that biota can exert influence over geomorphic processes, such as sediment transport, which in turn have biotic consequences and generate complex feedbacks. However, little attention has been paid to the potential for feedback to arise from evolutionary processes as population genetic composition changes in response to changing physical landscapes. In coastal ecosystems experiencing land loss, for example, shoreline erosion entails reduced plant survival and reproduction, and thereby represents a geomorphic response with inherent consequences for evolutionary fitness. To get at this topic, we examined the effect of genetic variation in the saltmarsh grass Spartina alterniflora, a renowned ecosystem engineer, on rates of shoreline erosion. Field transplantation studies and controlled greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare different genotypes from both wild and cultivated populations. Plant traits, soil properties, accretion/subsidence, and rates of land loss were measured. We found significant differences in rates of erosion between field plots occupied by different genotypes. Differences in erosion corresponded to variation in soil properties including critical shear stress and subsidence. Plant traits that differed across genotypes included belowground biomass, root tensile strength, and C:N ratios. Our results demonstrate the importance of genetic variation to salt marsh functioning, elucidating the relationship between evolutionary processes and ecogeomorphic dynamics in these systems. Because evolutionary processes can occur on ecological timescales, the direction and strength of ecogeomorphic feedbacks may be more dynamic than previously accounted for.",

            "abstract": "A littoral cell is a distinct area of a coastline in which sand enters the ocean (source), undergoes longshore transport, and is subsequently removed from the system (sink). Knowing the sediment budget of a littoral cell is an essential planning tool for coastal management, as an adequate supply of sand provides a buffer from seacliff erosion, one of the most pressing problems affecting coastal environments.\nIn California, littoral cells are typically bound in two different manners. First, prominent rocky headlands can block longshore transport around them. Second, and more commonly, submarine canyons may cross the continental shelf at a shallow enough depth as to intercept alongshore movement of sediment. In the Monterey Bay the largest sink is the Monterey Submarine Canyon, which is responsible for an estimated sand loss of -230,000 m3 each year.\nThis study presents the results of multiple, high-resolution, 3D Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) surveys conducted at Moss Landing Beach between Fall 2007 and Summer 2014. Direct measurements of beach volumetric changes and comparison with offshore wave data indicate that beach dynamics near a littoral cell sink are affected by both long-term seasonal oceanographic trends and small-scale storm-related variability.\nDuring the seven-year survey period, the beach showed the well-known seasonal trend of accretion during low-energy summer conditions and erosion during high-energy winter conditions, with a seasonal difference of up to 10,600 m3. However, winter conditions were also characterized by alternating episodes of accretion and erosion immediately following high-energy swell events and winter storms. Accretion was more pronounced during southwesterly swell events, as there was increased littoral transport and sand supply to the beach. This accretion was then followed by rapid erosion and flushing of sediment to the head of the submarine canyon and, ultimately, from the littoral cell. On average, this flushing occurred at a rate of more than -500 m3/day, with a maximum erosional rate of -1780 m3 over three days.",

The fee increases annually in a predictable manner. The funds collected are paid out to consumers as monthly dividends. The approach is market-based, in that the cost of the fee to producers is passed on to consumers in the cost of carbon-based fuels.

The Chapters are charged with public education and presenting the fee-and-dividend proposal to their respective Representatives and Senators. CCL builds trust by its non-partisan approach, meeting with all members of Congress regardless of party affiliation and stance on climate-related issues. CCL also builds trust by a non-confrontational approach, seeking to understand rather than to oppose.

            "abstract": "In many areas of Uruguay groundwater is the only source of water for human consumption and for industrial-agricultural economic activities. Traditionally considered as a safe source, due to the “natural filter” that occurs in porous media, groundwater is commonly used without any treatment.\nThe Uruguayan law requires bacteriological analysis for most water uses, but virological analyses are not mentioned in the legislation. In the Salto district, where groundwater is used for human consumption and for agricultural activities, bacterial contamination has been detected in several wells but no viruses analysis have been performed.\nThe Republic University (UDELAR), with the support of the National Agency for Research and Innovation (ANII), is studying the incidence of virus in groundwater on an intensive agriculture area of the Salto district. In this area water is pumped from the “Salto Aquifer”, a free sedimentary aquifer. Below this sedimentary deposit is the “Arapey” basaltic formation, which is also exploited for water productions on its fractured zones.\nA screening campaign has been performed searching for bacterial and viral contamination. Total and fecal coliforms have been found on several wells and Rotavirus and Adenovirus have been detected. A subgroup of the screening wells has been selected for an annual survey. On this subgroup, besides bacteria and viruses analysis, a standard physical and chemical characterization was performed. Results show a significant seasonal variation on microbiological contamination.\nIn addition to field studies, rotavirus circulation experiments on columns are being performed. The objective of this experiments is to determinate the parameters that control virus transport in porous media.\nThe results of the study are expected to provide an insight into the impacts of groundwater on Salto’s viral gastroenterocolitis outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is a ubiquitous component of the carbon cycle, yet controls on its landscape-level distribution, including the relative importance of mechanisms for transport across the terrestrial aquatic interface, are relatively unknown. In June 2012, the High Park Fire (HPF) burned 353 km2 of land in the Cache la Poudre (CLP) watershed just northwest of Fort Collins, CO. Following independent efforts of our group to quantify the effects of the HPF on biogeochemical pools and landscape geomorphology, we aimed to synthesize our respective datasets with two main objectives: 1. determine and relate BC content in different parts of the watershed including litter, soils, river bank sediments and dissolved and particulate organic materials in river water, 2. develop a conceptual framework for mechanisms that contribute to BC export from the CLP on short and long-term time scales.\nUsing the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method as a molecular proxy for BC concentrations, we found that the majority of BC deposited on the landscape by the HPF was located in the litter, coarse plant fraction of river bank sediments, and DOC, suggesting that BC mobilized on the landscape is transported downstream through the river network. In 2012, following the HPF, the 30-minute rainfall intensity required to mobilize sediment on hillslopes (critical I30) was 3.6 mm/hr, and in summer 2013, the critical I30 increased to 8.1 mm/hr, likely due to vegetation recovery. The low critical I30 in the first season following the fire indicated that BC could have been easily mobilized, even in small storms. Our working conceptual framework is that post fire, there are two phases of BC export from an ecosystem. In the first phase, BC export is primarily driven by transport of particulate material controlled by precipitation intensity and duration, along with the burn severity and slope of the landscape. The second phase of BC export is primarily in the dissolved form, and is driven by climatic controls such as precipitation amount and form, vegetation recovery and geologic features.",

            "abstract": "Chromite is one of the main reservoirs of chromium in the Earth, and is an essential important accessory mineral in upper mantle peridotites preserved in ophiolites. Generally, chromite is better preserved than silicates of the host peridotitic rocks, because it is more resistant to fluid-related processes; this has led to the widespread use of chromitites to track the evolution of Earth’s mantle convection.\nDeformed chromitites enclosed in serpentinized peridotites of Golyamo Kamenyane massif in SE Bulgaria have been studied as an example of chemical homogenization by deformation during metamorphism. Theses chromitites were affected by amphibolite-facies metamorphism and reacted with low fO2 fluids and subsequent oxidizing Fe3+-rich fluids (~ 1.0 GPa and 500-700ºC)(Gervilla et al., 2012).\nHere, we describe the details of how the microstructure was produced in chromite, showing the important role of deformation during metamorphism. They show porphyroclastic texture with coarse-grained porphyroclast (0.1 ~ 5 mm) and fine-grained neoblasts (> 100µm). Coarse-grained chromites show chemically zoned feature from core to rim, which preserve the initial igneous character, while at the rim a metamorphic signature is detectable. Our study using electron back-scattered diffraction reveals significant crystal-plastic deformation, such as inter-crystalline deformation defined by low-angle boundaries in the rim areas. Fine-grained chromites, both recrystallized and nucleated grains have higher Fe3+ and Cr and lower Mg# value compare to the core of coarse-grained chromites, which indicate that the fine- grained aggregates of chromite formed by both subgrain rotation and nucleation occurred in the presence of oxidizing fluids. Overall, deformation in a chemically distinct environment produced chemical homogenization of chromite.",

            "abstract": "Under anaerobic conditions, it is widely assumed that nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) reduction is primarily the result of microbial respiration. However, it has also been shown that abiotic reduction of nitrate and nitrite by reduced iron (Fe(II)), whether mineral-bound or surface-associated, may also occur under certain environmentally relevant conditions. With a range of experimental conditions, we investigated the nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope systematics of abiotic nitrite reduction by Fe(II) in an effort to characterize biotic and abiotic processes in the environment. While homogenous reactions between NO2- and Fe(II) in artificial seawater showed little reduction, heterogeneous reactions involving Fe-containing minerals showed considerable nitrite loss. Specifically, rapid nitrite reduction was observed in experiments that included reduced clays (illite, Na-montmorillonite, and nontronite) and those that exhibited iron oxide formation (ferrihydrite, magnetite and/or green rust). While these iron oxides and clay minerals offer both a source of reduced iron in the mineral matrix as well as a surface for Fe(II) activation, control experiments with corundum as a non-Fe containing mineral surface showed little NO2- loss, implicating a more dominant role of structural Fe in the clays during nitrite reduction. The isotope effects for 15N and 18O (15ε and 18ε) ranged from 5 to 14‰ for 15ε and 5 to 17‰ for 18ε and were typically coupled such that 15ε ~ 18ε. Reactions below pH 7 were slower and the 18ε was affected by oxygen atom exchange with water. Although little data exist for comparison with the dual isotopes of microbial NO2- reduction, these data serve as a benchmark for evaluating the role of abiotic processes in N reduction, particularly in sediment systems low in organic carbon and high in iron.",

            "abstract": "In southern California, the Pacific-North American relative plate motion is accommodated by a complex system of transcurrent, transcompressional, and transtensional faults. Although high-precision GPS measurements in recent years have greatly refined the kinematics of crustal motion and strain partitioning among major faults in Southern California, the causes of such strain partitioning and fault evolution remain uncertain. Using a three-dimensional viscoelasto-plastic finite element model, we have explored how the plate boundary fault system evolves to accommodate the relative plate motion in Southern California. Our results show that, when the plate boundary faults are not optimally orientated to accommodate the relative plate motion, new faults will be initiated. In particular, the Big Bend of the San Andreas Fault (SAF), which is the main plate boundary fault, impedes the relative plate motion, thus forces the development of a system of secondary faults. The evolution of these secondary faults is to minimize the work needed to accommodate the relative plate motion, and this mechanism provides a framework for understanding the present-day strain partitioning and earthquake hazards. In particular, the Big Bend and the offshore parallel faults facilitate strain localization in the Western Transverse Ranges in the form of thrust faults and blind faults, and the bends on the southern SAF enhance the development of the dextral faults across the Mojave Desert, where a number of damaging earthquakes occurred in recent years.",

            "abstract": "To understand the shallow part of plate interface between megathrust seismogenic zone and trench axis is very important for development of huge earthquake rupture and generation of tsunami. Monitoring of offshore seismicity near the Nankai trough by temporal ocean bottom seismographic observation in 2013 revealed that low-frequency tremor occurred associated with shallow very-low-frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) in the shallow part of plate interface. The shallow tremor episode lasted for approximately 1 month, which is almost consistent with the shallow VLFE activity observed from land broad-band seismic stations [Asano, 2014]. The horizontal location of shallow tremor estimate by envelope correlation method [Obara, 2002] shows a belt-like distribution along trench strike with narrow width than the deep tremor. The most remarkable feature of the shallow tremor activity is migration. There are two migration modes including diffusive slower migration and rapid tremor reversal (RTR), which are very similar to the deep tremor as a part of the ETS. This strongly indicates a possibility of the occurrence of episodic slow slip event in the shallow transition zone. That is to say, the migration of shallow tremor is supposed to be caused by migrating rupture front of SSE. In addition, the migration was detouring around the subducted Kyushu-Palau ridge. This suggests that the occurrence of tremor is sensitive to change in the shape of plate interface and seeks to propagate along almost the same depth range, in other word, a specified temperature and pressure condition. The narrow width distribution of shallow tremor also indicates that the shallow tremor is strongly related to dehydration process of a specified mineral under a narrow limited range of temperature and pressure condition compared to the deep tremor.",

            "abstract": "Changing socio-economic conditions and global environmental change continue to put pressure on critical natural resources necessary for sustaining ecosystems and human well-being – including water. Increasing variability in water availability, deepening droughts and continuing demands and consumptive use have posed problems for resource managers and policy makers in many regions. While in some regions it is still possible to enhance supply, such as in under-exploited water basins in Africa – the majority of the world’s heaviest water users are facing situations that call for more demand-side adjustments. This necessitates a change from engineering-focused solutions to more economic ones, especially where the costs of increasing supply (such as through de-salinization) are prohibitively expensive, or have unacceptable consequences for environmental sustainability.\nDespite many years and decades of studying water resource management problems, there is still too little guidance as to what institutional best-practices should be followed. Water resources tend to touch on a number of areas managed by different government departments and ministries (agriculture, aquaculture & fisheries, industry, natural resources, etc) – but there is still no common understanding of what the best governance arrangements are that lead to improved sectoral performance (however that is measured). Given the continuing efforts to invest in water resources management and development by major multi-lateral organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank – this kind of institutional guidance is critical, if countries are to make the most of these investments.\nIn this presentation, we review a number of cases in which previously supply-side oriented approaches have to be dealt with from the demand side, and why institutional flexibility and innovation is so important. We draw from examples of community-based groundwater management in India, groundwater overdraft management in China and the US, and try and synthesize some key priorities for further research and policy dialogue that are needed to enhance the sustainability of water resources in critical basins.",

            "abstract": "The northwestern South American plate shows a complex tectonic setting whose causes and relationship to mantle structure are still debated. We combine different techniques to elucidate some of the links between slabs and surface deformation in Colombia. Crustal structure beneath the Northern Andes was inferred from receiver functions where we find thicknesses of nearly 60 km beneath the plateau of the Eastern Cordillera and underneath the southern volcanic area of the Central Cordillera. We infer that such crustal thickening resulted from shortening, magmatic addition, and accretion-subduction. Analyses of relative teleseismic travel time delays and estimates of residual surface topography based on our new crustal model suggest that there are at least two subduction segments underneath the area. The Caribbean slab lies at a low angle beneath northernmost Colombia and steepens beneath the Eastern Cordillera. Such steepening is indicated by negative travel time relative residuals in the area of the Bucaramanga Nest, implying a cold anomaly in the upper mantle, and by positive residual topography just off the east of this area, perhaps generated by slab-associated return flow. Results for the western Andes and the Pacific coastal plains are consistent with “normal” subduction of the Nazca plate: travel time relative residuals there are predominantly positive, and the residual topography shows an W-E gradient, going from positive at the Pacific coastline to negative at the Magdalena Valley, which separates the eastern cordillera from the rest of the Colombian Andean system.\nAzimuthal analysis of relative travel time residuals further suggests the presence of seismically slow materials beneath the central part of the Eastern Cordillera. Azimuthal anisotropy from SKS splitting in that region indicates that seismically fast orientations do not follow plate convergence, different from what we find for the western Colombian Andes and the Caribbean and Pacific coastal plains. This may possibly indicate slab-continental keel interactions and N-S squeezing of the asthenosphere. This area has an associated young volcanism of alkaline affinity that probably suggests some type of asthenospheric mantle input.",

It is then combined with the Nan¸cay radio imaging data to\ninfer the three-dimensional position of the type II source. It is found that the type II source coincides with the\ninterface between the coronal mass ejection (CME) EUV wave front and a nearby coronal ray structure, providing\nevidence that the type II emission is physically related to the CME–ray interaction. This result, consistent with\nthose of previous studies, is based on simultaneous radio and EUV imaging data for the first time.",

            "abstract": "Liu et al. (2010) developed an algorithm to retrieve ozone profiles from the ground to ~60 km from OMI ultraviolet radiances using the optimal estimation technique (Rogers, 2000). This algorithm is for derivation of an ozone profile divided into 24 layers, with three layers in the troposphere (0-3km, 3-6km, 6-9km). In this study, we report results for the analysis of lower tropospheric ozone over CEC using the OMI ozone profiles mentioned above. First, we show good correlation of OMI-derived ozone with aircraft measurements and ozonesonde measurements. Second, we show significant enhancement of ozone derived from OMI over CEC. To interpret this remarkable enhancement of ozone, we show correlation of ozone with carbon monoxide (CO) and hotspot numbers suggesting the effects of crop burning on ozone enhancement. Third, we also show complementary data obtained in the field campaign at Mt. Tai in 2005 and 2006 (Kayana et al., 2013) to demonstrate ozone enhancement in June every year and show the relationship with residue burning in fields over Shandong and Hebei Provinces. Finally, we show important evidence of transboundary pollution transport from China to Korea and Japan.\n",

Until now, there has been no equivalence for water quality. Optics based systems now open the possibility to obtain data at a temporal resolution in par with that commonly used in quantitative hydrology (e.g. 15 min – 1 hr). We show that absorbance measured in the field using spectrophotometers can be statistically correlated with light- and none- absorbing constituents in the water. Water quality rating curves for 6-12 parameters can be derived as such using a single spectrophotometer, opening access to continuous water quality data for many parameters at a time. We then show that attaching such probe in the field with multiplexed pumping systems driven by Arduinos can expand the high temporal resolution capabilities to space as our systems can sample up to 12 different water sources located within 15 m of the water quality probe.",

            "abstract": "The California Tsunami Program has continued to build upon past preparedness efforts, carried out year-round, while leveraging government support at all levels during National Tsunami Preparedness Week, the last week of March. A primary goal is for everyone who lives at or visits the coast to understand basic safety measures when responding to official tsunami alerts or natural warnings. In 2014, more so than ever before, many local, coastal jurisdictions conducted grass-roots activities in their areas. When requested, state and federal programs stepped in to contribute subject matter expertise, lessons learned, and support. And, this year, the new website,\nwww.TsunamiZone.org\n, was developed. With a goal of establishing a baseline for future years, this website builds on the successes of the Great Shakeout Earthquake Drills (\nwww.ShakeOut.org\n) by allowing people to locate and register for tsunami preparedness events in their area. Additionally, it provides a central location for basic tsunami preparedness information, and links to find out more. The idea is not only to empower people with the best available, vetted, scientifically-based public safety information, but also to provide ways in which individuals can take physical action to educate themselves and others. Several broad categories of preparedness actions include: official acknowledgement of National Tsunami Preparedness Week, local “tsunami walk” drills, simulated tsunami-based exercises, testing of sirens and notification systems, outreach materials (brochures, videos, maps), workshops, presentations, media events, and websites. Next steps include building on the foundation established in 2014 by leveraging ShakeOut audiences, providing people with more information about how they can participate in 2015, and carrying the effort forward to other states and territories.",

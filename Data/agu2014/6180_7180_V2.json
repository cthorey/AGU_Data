            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP, 3.264 to 3.025 Ma) has been considered a possible analog for the future long-term consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas changes. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for this period have been estimated to be approximately 350 to 450 ppmv. We have now nearly surpassed globally the mid-point of this range and could surpass 450 ppmv by shortly after year 2030 in the most dire pathway of future emissions. In Phase I of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP), twelve coupled climate models simulated the mPWP time slab. These models could not reproduce the mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere warmth indicated by the PRISM3 dataset. Models suggest that Arctic sea ice, particularly no summer sea ice and much reduced winter sea ice, rather than changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and associated ocean heat transport, are key for reproducing the high-latitude warmth.\nPlanning for the modeling experiments, CMIP6, which will contribute to the IPCC AR6 in 2019, is underway. PlioMIP Phase II and PRISM4 have selected a time-slice centered at 3.205 Ma (3.204 to 3.207 Ma) to better constrain the comparisons between models and data and help reduce uncertainties associated with forcings incorporated into the model designs. In this talk, we will introduce the PlioMIP II protocols. We will also discuss those differences in the paleogeography and forcings from modern that may need to be considered when assessing the climate model simulations against proxy indicators of mid- and high-latitude temperature and the Pliocene as an analogue for the future. The model experiments included in PlioMIP II and PRISM4 dataset will be important not only for Pliocene4Future but also Pliocene4Pliocene, thus advancing our knowledge of this period in its own right.",

            "abstract": "Carbon acts as a component in greenhouse gases that regulate global climate. It is imperative to understand the transport and storage of carbon in order to understand and manage climate change. We examine terrestrial carbon storage in mountain lake deltas as a way of furthering our understanding of the terrestrial carbon sink, which is a poorly understood but significant contributor to the global carbon cycle. We examined subalpine lake deltas in the Washington Cascade Range and Colorado Front Range to test the following hypotheses: 1) The size of the deltaic carbon sink is strongly correlated with incision at the outlet of the lake and the topography of the basin. 2) Areas of high exhumation rates will have smaller and fewer deltas because a high exhumation rate should lead to more confined basins and more colluvium available to dam lake outlets, preventing lake level drop and corresponding delta formation. 3) High-energy deltas will transport more carbon to lakes, avoiding the deltaic carbon sink. At 27 lakes, we surveyed mountain lake deltas and took sediment samples, surveyed lake outlets in the field, and measured lake valley confinement in GIS to test hypotheses 1 and 3. Across the Snoqualmie and Skykomish watersheds in the Washington Cascades and the Colorado Front Range, we took a census of the number of natural lakes and the proportion of those lakes with deltas to test hypothesis 2. Preliminary results indicate that the Washington Cascades (high exhumation rate) have a higher density of lakes, but fewer deltas, than the Colorado Front Range (low exhumation rate). We also suspect that deltas in the Washington Cascades will have a lower carbon content than the Colorado Front Range due to generally higher energy levels on deltas. Finally, we found a substantial difference in the geomorphology and sediment type between beaver-affected and non-beaver-affected lakes in the Colorado Front Range.",

New field, U-Pb geochronology and whole rock geochemistry constraints from the northwestern segment of the Central Cordillera in the states of Antioquia and Caldas (Colombia) are used to understand the nature of the Late Cretaceous arc magmatism and evaluate the existence of single or multiple Pacific and Caribbean arc systems in the growth of the Northwestern Andes. The new results integrated with additional field and published information is used to suggest the existence of at least three different magmatic arcs. (1) An Eastern Continental arc built within a well defined Permian to Triassic continental crust that record a protracted 90-70 Ma magmatic evolution, (2) a 90-80 arc formed within attenuated continental crust and associated oceanic crust, (3) 90-88 Ma arc formed over a Late Cretaceous plateau crust. The eastern arcs were formed as part of double eastern vergent subduction system, where the most outboard arc represent a fringing arc formed over detached fragments of continental crust, whereas the easternmost continental arc growth by the closure an subduction of and older and broad Triassic to Early Jurassic back-arc ocean. Its closure also end up in ophiolite emplacement. The third allochtonous oceanic arc was formed over the Caribbean plateau crust and was accreted to the continental margin in the Late Cretaceous. Ongoing paleomagnetic, deformational, gravimetric and basin analysis will be integrate to test this model and understand the complex Late Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the Northern Andes.",

Most current physics-based models derive from the meander-morphodynamics equations introduced by Ikeda et al. (1981). Corresponding linear theories have focused almost exclusively on periodic sequences of small-amplitude meanders. Mathematical consideration of the equations shows that boundary conditions must be chosen carefully to yield numerical solutions for a well posed boundary value problem. The numerical algorithms presented in this work yield 2D solutions to the (corrected) Ikeda et al. (1981) equations with second order convergence in both time and space. We explore the characteristics of spatially versus temporally growing waves, as well as the effects of stochastic variations in the upstream boundary condition and in the dimensionless parameter β, which characterizes the strength of secondary flow relative to cross-stream shear. Consideration of the growth patterns for spatially growing waves provides some insight for the design of experimental systems exhibiting self sustaining river meanders.",

C stocks of mangroves are among the highest of any forest type on Earth. We have measured the ecosystem carbon stocks in mangroves across the world and found them to range from 250 to >2000 Mg C/ha which is a CO2 equivalence of 917 to 7340 Mg/ha.\nBecause the numerous values of mangroves are well known, it is ironic that rates of deforestation largely relating to land use/land cover change are among the highest of any forest type on earth exceeding that of tropical rain forests. Dominant causes of deforestation include conversion to aquaculture (shrimp), agricultural conversion, and coastal development. The carbon emissions arising from conversion of mangroves to other uses is exceptionally high. This is because vulnerability of the soil carbon stocks to losses with conversion. Emissions from conversion of mangrove to shrimp ponds range from about 800 to over 3000 Mg CO2e/ha. This places the carbon footprint of shrimp arising from such ponds as among the highest of any food product available.\nOf great interest is the potential value of mangroves in carbon marketing strategies and other financial incentives that are derived from the conservation of standing forests. This is because of the combination of high carbon stocks in intact mangroves, the high greenhouse gas emissions arising from their conversion, and the conservation of other valuable ecosystem services provided by intact mangroves.",

Among the most important will be alterations in the hydrologic cycle, changes in water supply and demand, and impacts on existing water-related infrastructure. Because of the complexity of our water systems, adaptation responses will be equally complex. This problem has made it difficult for water managers and planners to develop and implement adaptation strategies. This talk will address three ways to think about water-related adaptation approaches to climate change: (1) strategies that are already being implemented to address population and economic changes without climate change; (2) whether these first-line strategies are appropriate for additional impacts that might result from climatic changes; and (3) new approaches that might be necessary for new, non-linear, or threshold impacts. An effort will also be made to differentiate between adaptation strategies that influence the hydrologic cycle directly (e.g., cloud seeding), those that influence supply management (e.g., construction of additional reservoirs or water-distribution systems), and those that affect water demand (e.g., removal of outdoor landscaping, installation of efficient irrigation systems).",

            "abstract": "Alaska’s extensive shorelines are incompletely mapped and under-instrumented to proceed with widespread assessments of coastal vulnerability. Despite this baseline data shortage, many of Alaska’s coastal communities are involved in mitigation or adaptation efforts in response to natural hazards such as erosion and flooding. To provide coastal communities with the tools that are necessary to support local decision-making, the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) has undertaken focused field studies to improve quality, quantity and access to coastal datasets such as topography, nearshore bathymetry, rates of shoreline change and relevant water levels. These efforts are inclusive of both standard approaches (e.g. lidar, repeat coastal profile measurements, Digital Shoreline Analysis System assessments and fully-instrumented tide stations) as well as alternative methodologies that improve our ability to economically accomplish this work in harsh, remote areas (e.g. Structure From Motion surface models, quantification of local knowledge observations, stop-gap tidal datum conversion tools, and pressure-sensor water level networks). We present a comprehensive summary of the geographic variability of coastal dynamics and geohazard potential along the Alaska shoreline, from the erosion-prone North Slope coastline to low-lying areas in western Alaska that are at elevated risk to storm surge inundation. This work provides a graphical summary of the existing quality and spatial extent of data in Alaskan coastal communities while highlighting critical data gaps, such as high-precision elevation models, which are delaying more robust flood and erosion vulnerability mapping. By outlining ongoing work and providing examples from recent DGGS projects we will showcase some of the new vulnerability mapping tools under development for our state and also identify opportunities for necessary collaborations in the Alaska coastal zone.",

            "abstract": "While discussions of global climate change tend to center on greenhouse gases and sea level\nrise, other factors, such as technological developments, land and energy use, economics, and population\ngrowth all play a critical role in understanding climate change. There is increasing urgency for methods\nto forecast how different sectors, in particular ecosystems and the goods and services they provide, may\nbe altered as a result of climate change. However, due to their complexity, it is difficult to assess these\necosystem services at a single point in space or time, as they may be influenced by surrounding and\ndistant patterns of land use and biophysical attributes in addition to climate change. In order to make\nmeaningful conservation and adaptation choices, specific ecosystem components must be viewed in\nrelation to future climate information. The US Environmental Protection Agency and its partners, have\ndeveloped EnviroAtlas, a web‐based geospatial tool that allows users to interact with climate change\nmodeling information while simultaneously providing a range of information and data on different\necosystem goods and services. This can be a useful platform for inquiry about the supply, demand, or\nbenefits provided by a specific ecosystem service, and to understand the potential impacts to that\necosystem service due to our changing climate. Housing a variety of data in one publicly available tool\nencourages users to think in new, trans‐disciplinary ways that focus on the relationships between\necosystem services and climate change impacts. By combining many fields of research through this easyto‐\nuse interface, the result is a novel tool that is spatially and temporally explicit and enables better\ndecision making across multiple sectors. This talk will illustrate how the information presented in\nEnviroAtlas can be used in research.",

Numerical weather prediction models and decision support tools have been developed to provide forecasters a better basis for forecasting heavy precipitation and consequent flooding. The HMT also involves a joint project with California Department of Water Resources (CA-DWR) and the Scripps Institute for Oceanography (SIO) as part of CA-DWR's Enhanced Flood Response and Emergency Preparedness (EFREP) program. The HMT activities have included development and calibration of a distributed hydrologic model, the NWS Office of Hydrologic Development’s (OHD) Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM), to prototype the distributed approach for flood and other water resources applications. HMT has applied RDHM to the Russian-Napa watersheds for research assessment of gap-filling weather radars for precipitation and hydrologic forecasting and for establishing a prototype to inform both the NWS Monterey Forecast Office and the California Nevada River Forecast Center (CNRFC) of RDHM capabilities.\nIn this presentation, a variety of precipitation forcings generated with and without gap filling radar and rain gauge data are used as input to RDHM to assess the hydrologic response for selected case study events. Both the precipitation forcing and hydrologic model are run at different spatial and temporal resolution in order to examine the sensitivity of runoff to the precipitation inputs. Based on the timing of the events and the variations of spatial and temporal resolution, the parameters which dominate the hydrologic response are identified. The assessment is implemented at two USGS stations (Ukiah near Russian River and Austin Creek near Cazadero) that are minimally influenced by managed flows and objective evaluation can thus be derived. The results are assessed using statistical metrics, including daily Nash scores, Pearson Correlation, and sub daily timing errors.",

One of the largest events in 1629 generated a tsunami that reached a height of >16 m. Another event in 1674 caused a submarine landslide that produced a tsunami >100 m based on the vegetation trim line. An earthquake storm struck the region between 1814 and 1857. During this time there were two mega-earthquakes (1820 and 1852) felt throughout most of Indonesia, which generated tsunamis as high as 26 m. Tsunamis also occurred from earthquakes in 1814, 1818, 1836 and 1857, and the eruption of Tambora (1815). This eruption is the one of the most notable extreme historical geohazards not only in the Indonesian region, but globally. The earthquake storm ended with an event along the north coast of East Timor in 1857, which caused a 3 m tsunami that inundated the capital city of Dili and flooded many villages. Tsunamigenic earthquakes have also struck the area around Kupang, West Timor, which is one of the main commercial centers of the region with a population of half a million. The population of the region is now at least 10 million. Another 2 million people live along the coast of the Makassar Strait, which has experienced 18 tsunamis since the 1820 earthquake. Most people now live in cities, most cities have unreinforced masonry construction and some are in historical tsunami inundation zones. Cities along the NW coast of Australia are also at risk of a tsunami from mega-thrust earthquakes along parts of the Timor Trough, which accumulates strain at the rate of 22 mm/a. No major earthquakes are documented along the Timor to Tanimbar part of the plate boundary since historical records have been kept. However, a major mega-thrust earthquake (8.5-9.0) occurred along the Tanimbar trough in 1852, which caused an 8 m tsunami. We have modeled both the 1629 and 1852 mega-thrust events and used these data to map inundation zones for coastal communities. We have also discovered deposits from these and other tsunamis throughout the region. Much of the historical records are now translated into Indonesian. The WAVES team of the Non-Profit Organization ‘In Harms Way’ is distributing the records throughout the region and has made > 30 presentations in cities and villages in tsunami inundation zones.

            "abstract": "Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) inhabit regions rich in biodiversity that play an important role in the local and regional water cycle. Canopy plants such as epiphytes and hemiepiphytes are an important component of the biodiversity in the TMCF and therefore play a significant role in the carbon, nutrient and water cycles. With only partial or no access to resources on the ground, canopy plants may be vulnerable to changes in climate that increase canopy temperatures and decrease atmospheric humidity or precipitation inputs. Despite their importance in the TMCF, there is little information regarding drought tolerance and water balance in this community. In this study we quantified variation in functional traits and water relations in 12 species of epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in a Costa Rican TMCF. We also generated pressure-volume curves and xylem vulnerability curves that we used as indicators of drought tolerance. Lastly, we determined the capacity for foliar water uptake in the laboratory and measured whole-plant transpiration in the field. We found that all species had a high turgor loss point (ψTLP), high vulnerability to cavitation (P50), and low bulk elastic modulus (εmax, i.e. high cell wall elasticity). These results indicate that capacitance may be high in canopy plants and that stored water may help to maintain high leaf water potentials during dry periods. We also found that all species had the capacity for foliar uptake and that this process contributed substantially to their water status and water balance. On average, foliar uptake contributed to the reabsorption of 70% of the water transpired over a 34-day period at the beginning of the dry season. Our results indicate that canopy plants can mitigate water loss substantially, but they may be vulnerable to changes in the overall precipitation patterns or increases in cloud base heights.",

To encourage uptake of CCS by industry, the province has provided partial funding to two demonstration scale projects, namely the Quest Project by Shell and partners (CCS), and the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line Project (pipeline and CO2-EOR). Important to commercial scale implementation of CCS will be the requirement to prove conformance and containment of the CO2 plume injected during the lifetime of the CCS project. This will be a challenge for monitoring programs. The Containment and Monitoring Institute (CaMI) is developing a Field Research Station (FRS) to calibrate various monitoring technologies for CO2 detection thresholds at relatively shallow depths. The objective being assessed with the FRS is sensitivity for early detection of loss of containment from a deeper CO2 storage project. In this project, two injection wells will be drilled to sandstone reservoir targets at depths of 300 m and 700 m. Up to four observation wells will be drilled with monitoring instruments installed. Time-lapse surface and borehole monitoring surveys will be undertaken to evaluate the movement and fate of the CO2 plume. These will include seismic, microseismic, cross well, electrical resistivity, electromagnetic, gravity, geodetic and geomechanical surveys. Initial baseline seismic data from the FRS will presented.",

            "abstract": "Climatic changes are recorded by biogenic remains fossilized in marine sediment. These remains and their chemical and isotopic properties allow the establishment of times series of ocean/climate parameters (temperature, sea ice cover, salinity, productivity), as well as of inland vegetation (from pollen grains in continental margin sediments). Such \"paleoclimate\" studies provide a comprehensive picture of Holocene climate changes at low to mid latitudes but Arctic-subarctic regions remain poorly documented. The rarity of representative records is mostly due to their remote and difficult access, as well as to the generally low biogenic content of marine sediment because of low productivity and/or poor preservation of biominerals (carbonates and opal). Moreover, when available, time series from Arctic-subarctic often suffer poor time resolution and chronological control. Nevertheless, a few paleoclimate records are available. Some of the best-resolved time series are from the Canadian Arctic (eastern and northern Baffin bay, Hudson Strait). They show large amplitude changes during the glacial/interglacial transition in relation with meltwater discharge rates and sea-level changes, and point to the inception of full “postglacial conditions” some 7000 years ago only. Since then, they also recorded millennial type oscillations of smaller amplitude, but out of phase in the western vs eastern subpolar North Atlantic. Paleoclimate reconstructions from marine cores often provide a picture of a \"mean\" decadal to centennial state of the environment because of the time span represented by sediment samples adding to smoothing effect of sea-floor sediment mixing by benthic organisms. In contradistinction, humane occupation and mobility might be more directly influenced by climate instabilities and extreme events, whose documentation from sedimentary archives represents a real challenge for the geoscience community.",

            "abstract": "Talus does not always indicate mass wasting due to destructive faulting, landslides, or caldera collapse. That talus slopes might be constructed during submarine volcanic eruptions was first recognized in 2005 from ROV observations and samples of lava that dripped over a cliff of a steep pillow mound of the 1996 eruption on the Gorda Ridge. Such talus was also found in 2013 along the steep pillow ridge that formed on the South Rift of Axial Volcano during the 2011 eruption. At each site, wedges and stubby cylinders of broken glass-rimmed pillow lava lie at the base of a vertical cliff of truncated pillows, as they do in other places where faults may have broken them. However, more telling evidence of this process is slender, elongate glassy rods of lava, which we call “lavacicles” from their resemblance to icicles, which were lying below the overhanging cliffs from which they had dripped and fallen. The drips can be phyric and aphyric lava, primitive to evolved in composition. Therefore they don’t indicate a particular basaltic composition or viscosity; they probably result from very slow eruption rate that builds a steep stack of pillows.\nIn 1 meter resolution AUV bathymetric maps, these talus slopes appear much like talus found at the base of fault-block slices at other parts of those ridges and at the highly faulted Endeavour Segment, however these pillow ridges are too young to have been tectonically faulted. Their orientations are not necessarily aligned with the dominant strike of faults in the area, but instead with the outline of the pillow mounds. We now have identified numerous other constructional talus slopes at Gorda and Juan de Fuca Ridges, Alarcon Rise, and Davidson Seamount off California that meet this criterion so are likely to be constructional also. At intermediate rate ridges constructional talus and cliffs contribute a small amount of the area, but perhaps significant permeability pathways for hydrothermal circulation.",

These changes in ecosystem function and services typically result from shifts in climate or land use and are enhanced by positive feedbacks with the biota and human societies. Here we show the important role of ecohydrological feedbacks in determining pathways of land degradation and highlight their long range environmental and societal impacts. Crucial to several desertification feedbacks is plants’ sensitivity to limited water availability and the ability of vegetation to modify its physical environment. We investigate how by reducing soil susceptibility to wind erosion and dust emissions plants can improve the hydrological conditions that are crucial to their survival. Using field data and model simulations we see how enhanced aeolian activity may sustain a desertification feedback that has often been overlooked.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica is comprised of alpine and terminal glaciers, large expanses of patterned ground, and permanently ice-covered lakes in the valley floors, which are linked by glacial meltwater streams that flow during the austral summer. These valleys were first explored by Robert Scott and his party in 1903. In 1968 the New Zealand Antarctic Program began a gauging network on the Onyx River, a 32 km river in Wright Valley which is the longest river in Antarctica. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological research project our research group has monitored meteorological conditions, glacial mass balance, lake level and streamflow in the adjacent Taylor Valley. The extent of liquid water throughout the landscape is strongly controlled by summer climate, and the availability of liquid water in turn is a limitation to the microscopic life that is present in the diverse habitats in the valleys. We have studied the responses of soil, lake, stream and cryoconite ecosystems through a sustained cooling period that has been driven by atmospheric changes associated with the ozone hole. In the past decade, this cooling period appears to have ceased and summer conditions have become more variable. Three warm sunny summers have occurred since 2001/02. These conditions have created weeks long \"flood events\" in the valleys, causing wet areas to emerge in the soils, thermokarsting in some stream channels and increases in lake level. These flood events can be considered as pulse events that drive an increase in ecosystem connectivity, changing rates of biogeochemical processes and the distribution of biota. Collectively the ecosystems of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are highly responsive to dynamic climatic influences associated with the ozone hole and global warming.",

            "abstract": "While continuous monitoring of stream flow and stream temperature has been a widely used resource for some time, currently there is great potential to expand continuous monitoring to include important water quality parameters such as nutrients and dissolved organic material. In many systems distinguishing between watershed and stream ecosystem controls can be challenging, and the usefulness of such monitoring can be enhanced by application of quantitative models to interpret observed patterns. The glacial meltwater streams of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are surrounded by large expanses of patterned ground devoid of plants. In contrast, many streams have thriving cyanobacterial mats that are freeze-dried through the winter and begin photosynthesis with the onset of flow. Thus, the daily signal in terms of biogeochemical processes controlling water quality is generated within the stream. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research project, we have conducted field experiments and developed coupled biogeochemical transport models for the role of hyporheic exchange in controlling weathering of major ions, microbial cycling of nitrogen species, and streams temperature regulation. We have also adapted modelling approaches from sediment transport to understand mobilization of stream biomass with increasing flows. These models are relevant to understanding the role of in-stream processes in diverse stream systems where watershed processes also contribute to observed patterns.",

Spatio-temporal variability of potential drivers – hydroclimate and water use – influencing the freshwater sustainability are examined both individually as well as collectively by considering the eco-region and 4-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-4)as the spatial reference for the analysis. A detailed analysis on national water use also indicates a north-south gradient with Frostbelt being more efficient in water use as opposed to the Sunbelt. This basically stems from the understanding of regional cross-differences in public supply consumption per capita which is significantly low in high-income urban counties. National analyses on agricultural water use efficiency (i.e., per-acreage application) also shows sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation being the primary drivers of differences in agricultural consumption. Given the well-known hydroclimatic west (arid)-east (humid) gradient across the Sunbelt, the study also evaluates the role of flow anomalies – represented by the changes in magnitude, frequency and timing of extremes (high flows and low flows) and by the changes in seasonality – in influencing native fish diversity patterns, as a proxy for freshwater biodiversity, in virgin basins and in basins influenced by significant storage and pumping. Cross-regional differences in water consumption during and after droughts are also presented in the context of adaptations and policy relevance.",

            "abstract": "Non-dispersive or “young” plasma injection events observed near midnight at Saturn are modulated at the period associated with the winter hemisphere [Kennelly et al., 2013]. Most other periodic dynamics of the magnetosphere are dominated by responses at the period of the summer hemisphere. The anomalous periodicity of plasma injection has not been explained. We present a theoretical explanation of ionospheric control, noting (as do Kennelly et al.) that the growth rate of the interchange instability is controlled by ionospheric conductance although the instability condition does not involve the ionosphere [Southwood and Kivelson, 1989]. The motion of the foot of a flux tube through the ionosphere is impeded by high conductance (line tying). Low conductance allows slippage and rapid growth of the instability. When the ionospheres have very different conductances, flux tube motion may be asymmetrical, with rapid displacement occurring only in the low conductance, winter hemisphere. A rotationally modulated low conductivity in that hemisphere would impose periodicity on injections. Pre-equinox (2009) at Saturn, the northern hemisphere conductance was low but probably varied with rotation phase because of the pattern of field-aligned currents (FACs) thought to rotate about the pole at the northern period, TN[Jia and Kivelson, 2012]. The upward current region in the ionosphere was probably more highly ionized than the downward current region because of electron precipitation. Two predictions follow. (1) The probability of an injection event in the midnight sector should maximize when the downward FAC in the winter hemisphere (conductivity minimum) has rotated into the midnight sector and (2) in northern winter, the tilt of the interchanging flux tube should produce positive radial field perturbations at and above the equator for inward-moving flux tubes and negative radial field perturbations for outward-moving flux tubes. Tests of these predictions will be reported.\n______________\nJia, X., and M. G. Kivelson (2012), J. Geophys. Res., doi:10.1029/2012JA018183\nKennelly, T. J., J. S. Leisner, G. B. Hospodarsky, and D.

The purpose of this preliminary study is to estimate potential flood inundation areas as a hazard (both present and future condition), and flood exposure change over the Asia region with consideration of climate change impacts.\nA flood hazard was characterized by inundation area at the high-resolution of 500 m, location (lowland around rivers), and probability (floods with the 50-year return period). This study introduced a new approach to moderate the global flood hazard and the exposure calculation with significant limitations of current models for continental-scale flood risk assessment by using the flood inundation depth (FID) model based on Manning’s steady, uniform flow resistance formula in extreme case during 25-year simulations based on the global BTOP distributed hydrological model using precipitations from the MRI-AGCM 3.2S with SRES A1B emissions scenarios for present-day (daily data from 1980 to 2004), and end-of-the-21st century (daily data from 2075 to 2099). It effectively simplified the complexity between hydrological and topological variables in a flood risk-prone area with assumption of the effects of natural or artificial levees. Exposure was obtained by combining the hazards at the same resolution to identify affected population by calculating with urbanization ratio and population change ratio of Asian countries from a distributed data of global population (Landscan by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory).\nAs a result of the physical exposure assessment from present to the end-of-the-21st century, potential hazards area and affected population are projected to increase 4.2 % (approximately 75,900 km2) and 3.4 % (approximately 35.1 million people) respectively, because Asian population increases about 43% in the future. We found that Bangladesh was listed at the top as the most high risk country in the Asian region: the largest vulnerable population of the river floods by the impact of climate change. For the flood risk assessment, it is important to understand the characteristic of correlation between hazard and exposure among the Asian countries.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon forest is a major component of the Earth System, however its structure, dynamics and functioning could be severely disrupted if droughts became more frequent. The vulnerability of different Amazonian areas to droughts was evaluated using the Ecosystem Demography model (ED-2.2). We simulated forest dynamics under a suite of rainfall regime scenarios for two sites in the Eastern Amazon with strong rainfall seasonality but very different total rainfall. While the model simulations predicted nearly no response in mortality or primary productivity at Paracou (wettest site), the model suggests that even moderate shifts of the mean rainfall could cause significant biomass loss at Tapajos (driest site), particularly amongst the largest trees, pioneers, and evergreens. The simulations that produced the largest losses were those in which the return period of extreme droughts became shorter than one decade hence not allowing\nsufficient time for recovery. By defining vulnerability as the change in rainfall regime needed to reduce the return period to dangerous levels, we identified the most vulnerable areas to be near the forest Southern and Eastern limits, but also over large areas in Eastern Amazon.",

            "abstract": "More than 1,700 exoplanets have been discovered to date, including a handful of potentially habitable ones. There is on average more than one planet per star, and estimates of occurrence rates for potentially habitable planets (eta_Earth) from the Kepler mission range between ~5 and 50%.\nSeveral mission concepts have been studied to directly image planets around nearby stars. Direct imaging enables spectroscopic detection of biomarkers such as atmospheric oxygen and methane, which would be highly suggestive of extraterrestrial life. It is commonly thought that directly imaging a potentially habitable exoplanet requires telescopes with apertures of at least 1m, costing at least $1B, and launching no earlier than the 2020s.\nA notable exception to this is Alpha Centauri. The system contains two Sun-like stars with a wide separation that allows dynamically stable habitable zones around either star. Habitable zones span about 0.5-1” in stellocentric angle, ~3x wider than around any other FGKM star. A ~30cm visible light space telescope is sufficient to resolve the habitable zone and detect a potentially habitable planet in minutes with ideal components, or days with realistic ones.\nWe are developing a mission concept called ACEND (Alpha Centauri Direct Imager) consisting of a ~30cm primary, a Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization coronagraph, and a wavefront control system. It is designed to suppress the light leak from both stars and directly image their planetary systems in 3 color channels, including the capability to detect potentially habitable planets. Color imaging is sufficient to differentiate Venus-like, Earth-like, and Mars-like planets from each other and establish the presence of Earth-pressure atmosphere through Rayleigh scattering.\nTwo factors make it possible to realize the requirements of ACEND (most notably 10^10 contrast) on a small budget and fast schedule: (a) ACEND will collect a long continuous sequence of images on Alpha Centauri A and B for 2 years, enabling much better speckle subtraction than missions that have many targets, thus greatly relaxing the requirements on the raw contrast of the coronagraph; (b) the small scale regime implies greater rigidity and stability, as well as smaller optics with better wavefronts.",

            "abstract": "In historic times, Northern California has suffered the greatest losses from tsunamis in the U.S. contiguous 48 states. 39 tsunamis have been recorded in the region since 1933, including five that caused damage. This paper describes the Redwood Coast Tsunami Work Group (RCTWG), an organization formed in 1996 to address the tsunami threat from both near and far sources. It includes representatives from government agencies, public, private and volunteer organizations, academic institutions, and individuals interested in working to reduce tsunami risk. The geographic isolation and absence of scientific agencies such as the USGS and CGS in the region, and relatively frequent occurrence of both earthquakes and tsunami events has created a unique role for the RCTWG, with activities ranging from basic research to policy and education and outreach programs. Regional interest in tsunami issues began in the early 1990s when there was relatively little interest in tsunamis elsewhere in the state. As a result, the group pioneered tsunami messaging and outreach programs. Beginning in 2008, the RCTWG has partnered with the National Weather Service and the California Office of Emergency Services in conducting the annual “live code” tsunami communications tests, the only area outside of Alaska to do so. In 2009, the RCTWG joined with the Southern California Earthquake Alliance and the Bay Area Earthquake Alliance to form the Earthquake Country Alliance to promote a coordinated and consistent approach to both earthquake and tsunami preparedness throughout the state. The RCTWG has produced and promoted a variety of preparedness projects including hazard mapping and sign placement, an annual “Earthquake – Tsunami Room” at County Fairs, public service announcements and print material, assisting in TsunamiReady community recognition, and facilitating numerous multi-agency, multidiscipline coordinated exercises, and community evacuation drills. Nine assessment surveys from 1993 to 2013 have tracked preparedness actions and personal awareness of tsunami hazards. Over the twenty-year period covered by the surveys, respondents aware of a local tsunami hazard increased from 51 to 90 percent and awareness of the Cascadia subduction zone increased from 16 to 60 percent.",

            "abstract": "The Indian Ocean experienced its most devastating natural disaster through the action of a Tsunami, resulting from of an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on 26th of December 2004. This resulted in widespread damage both to property and human lives with over 250,000 deaths in the region and many millions homeless. Our understanding of tsunami generation and propagation has increased significantly over the past decade. In this presentation, results obtained from detailed analysis of sea level data from Western Australia and Sri Lanka together with numerical modelling are presented to highlight the effects of topography both at the surface and subsurface. The major effects are due to wave reflection and refraction. Examples of wave reflection include: impacts on Malaysia/Thailand, Sri Lanka and Western Australia due to wave reflection from Sri Lanka, Maldives and Mascarene Ridge, respectively. In the case of Sri Lanka, the maximum wave height recorded along the west coast during the 2004 tsunami was due to the reflected wave from Maldives impacting 3 hours after the arrival of the initial waves. Similarly, along the West coast of Australia highest waves occurred 15 hours after the arrival of the first wave. Here, based on travel times, we postulate that the waves were reflected from the Mascarene Ridge and/or the island of Madagascar (Figure 1b). The conclusions based on observations were verified using numerical model simulations using the MOST and ComMIT models. Numerical modelling using the MOST model indicated the role of offshore susurface topography on tsunami propagation through wave wave refraction. Examples of wave refraction included the effects of deep water seamounts (Venin Meinesz) and plateaus (Wallaby, Cuvier and Exmouth) on tsunami propagation along the West Australian coast. The tsunami waves are first scattered by the Venin Meinesz seamounts and were then refracted by the Wallaby and Cuvier plateaus resulting in waves being deflected onto the coast.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a hazard that lends itself well to diligent, sustained monitoring and early warning. However, unlike most hazards, the fact that droughts typically evolve slowly, can last for months or years and cover vast areas spanning multiple political boundaries/jurisdictions and economic sectors can make it a daunting task to monitor, develop plans for, and identify appropriate, proactive mitigation strategies.\nThe National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) and National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) have been working together to reduce societal vulnerability to drought by helping decision makers at all levels to: 1) implement drought early warning/forecasting and decision support systems; 2) support and advocate for better collection of, and understanding of drought impacts; and 3) increase long-term resilience to drought through proactive planning.\nThe NDMC and NIDIS risk management approach has been the basis from which many partners around the world are developing a collaboration and coordination nexus with an ultimate goal of building comprehensive global drought early warning information systems (GDEWIS). The core emphasis of this model is on developing and applying useful and usable information that can be integrated and transferred freely to other regions around the globe. The High–Level Ministerial Declaration on Drought, the Integrated Drought Management Programme (IDMP) co-led by the WMO and the Global Water Partnership (GWP), and the Global Framework for Climate Services are drawing extensively from the integrated NDMC-NIDIS risk management framework.\nThis presentation will describe, in detail, the various drought resources, tools, services, and collaborations already being provided and undertaken at the national and regional scales by the NDMC, NIDIS, and their partners. The presentation will be forward-looking, identifying improvements in existing and proposed mechanisms to help strengthen national and international drought early warning information systems to support preparedness and adaptation decisions in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The demand for improved climate knowledge and information is well documented. As noted in the IPCC Reports (SREX, AR5) and other assessments, this demand has increased pressure for better information to support planning under changing rates of extremes event occurrence. This demand has focused on mechanisms used to respond to past variability and change, including, integrated resource management (watersheds, coasts), infrastructure design, information systems, technological optimization, financial risk management, and behavioral and institutional change. Climate inputs range from static site design statistics (return periods) to dynamic, emergent thresholds and transitions preceded by steep response curves and punctuated equilibria. Tradeoffs are evident in the use of risk-based anticipatory strategies vs. resilience measures. In such settings, annual decision calendars for operational requirements can confound adaptation expectations. Key knowledge assessment questions include: (1) How predictable are potential impacts of events in the context of other stressors, (2) how is action to anticipate such impacts informed, and (3) How often should criteria for “robustness” be reconsidered? To illustrate, we will discuss the climate information needs and uses for two areas of concern for both short and long-term risks (i) climate and disaster risk financing, and (ii) watershed management. The presentation will focus on the climate information needed for (1) improved monitoring, modeling and methods for understanding and analyzing exposure risks, (2) generating risk profiles, (3) developing information systems and scenarios for critical thresholds across climate time and space scales, (4) embedding annual decision calendars in the context of longer-term risk management, (5) gaming experiments to show the net benefits of new information. We will conclude with a discussion of the essential climate variables needed to implement services-delivery and development efforts such as the Global Framework for Climate Services and the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a slow-onset hazard that is a normal part of climate. Drought onset and demise are difficult to determine. Impacts are mostly nonstructural, spread over large geographical areas, and can persist long after precipitation deficits end. These factors hinder development of accurate, timely estimates of drought severity and resultant responses. Drivers of drought range from SST anomalies and global scale atmospheric response, through regional forcing and local land-surface feedbacks. Key climatological questions related to drought risk assessment, perception and management include, “Does a drought end by a return to normal precipitation; how much moisture is required and over what period; can the end of a drought be defined by the diminishing impacts e.g. soil moisture, reservoir volumes; will precipitation patterns on which management systems rely, change in the future?”\nEffective early warning systems inform strategic responses that anticipate crises and crisis evolution across climate timescales. While such “early information” is critical for defining event onset, it is even more critical for identifying the potential for increases in severity. Many social and economic systems have buffers in place to respond to onset (storage, transfers and purchase of grain) but lack response capabilities as drought intensifies, as buffers are depleted. Throughout the drought lifecycle (and between events), monitoring, research and risk assessments are required to:\nMap decision-making processes and resource capabilities including degradation of water and ecosystems\nPlace multiple climate and land surface indicators within a consistent triggering framework (e.g. climate and vegetation mapping) before critical thresholds are reached\nIdentify policies and practices that impede or enable the flow of information, through policy gaming and other exercises\nThe presentation will outline the capabilities and framework needed to ensure improved scientific inputs to preparedness and adaptation.

            "abstract": "Located at the convergence of air masses between the westerlies and monsoon, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) undergoes complex water cycle processes, which need to be documented and understood through a combination of variant methodologies. The stable oxygen isotope ratio (δ18O) in precipitation is an integrated tracer of the atmospheric processes and has been used worldwide. Since the 1990s, an intensive effort has been dedicated to studying precipitation isotopic composition at more than 20 stations in the TP. Based on these observations, we establish a database of precipitation δ18O and use different models to evaluate the climatic drivers of present-day precipitation δ18O over the TP. The spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation δ18O and their relationships with temperature and precipitation reveal three distinct domains, respectively associated with the influence of the westerlies (Northern TP), Indian monsoon (Southern TP) and transition in between. The seasonal patterns of precipitation δ18O are diverse in different domains. High-resolution atmospheric models equipped with stable isotopes capture the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation δ18O and their relationships with moisture transport from the westerlies and Indian monsoon. Only in the westerlies domain are atmospheric models able to represent qualitatively and quantitatively the relationships between climate and precipitation δ18O. More significant temperature effect exists when either the westerlies or Indian monsoon is the sole dominant atmospheric process. The observed and simulated altitude-δ18O relationships strongly depend on the season and the domain (monsoon or westerlies). Our results have crucial implications for the interpretation of the abundant stable isotope information derived from natural climatic archives over the TP such as ice cores, lake sediments or tree rings, and for the application of atmospheric simulations to quantifying paleo-climate and paleo-elevation changes.",

Further, a large proportion of delta populations experience extremes of poverty and are highly vulnerable to the environmental and ecological stress and degradation that is occurring.\nA systems dynamics approach is adopted to provide policy makers with the knowledge and tools to enable them to evaluate the effects of Geohazards and environmental stressors and associated policy decisions on people's livelihoods (Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation - ESPA Deltas). This is done by a multidisciplinary and multi-national team of policy analysts, social and natural scientists and engineers. The work presents a participatory approach to formally evaluating ecosystem services and poverty in the context of the wide range of environmetnal stressors and hazards. These changes include subsidence and sea level rise, land degradation and population pressure in delta regions. The approach will be developed, tested and applied in coastal Bangladesh.\nRural livelihoods are inextricably linked with the natural ecosystems and low income farmers are highly vulnerable to changes in ecosystem services as they are impacted by geohazards and environmental stressors. Their health, wellbeing and financial security are under threat from many directions such as unreliable supplies of clean water, increasing salinisation of soils and flood, while in the longer term they are threatened by subsidence and sea-level rise. This study will contribute to the understanding of this present vulnerability and help the people who develop the relevant policy to make more informed choices about how best to reduce this vulnerability.",

At D-region / mesospheric altitudes, the plasma is collisional on scales of the radar wavelength and thus ion drifts can be used as a direct proxy for neutral motions. At E-region / lower-thermospheric altitudes, the ions undergo a transition whereby the mean free path approaches the scale of the Bragg-scattering wavelength. In the F-region / upper thermosphere, the ions are collisionless and drift at the ExB velocity. The sensing of ion motions is thus extremely useful for the assessment of ionospheric electrodynamics. We utilize case studies from the Poker Flat and Arecibo ISRs to illustrate the utility of this feature of ion motions by showing (a) examples of neutral wind measurements from the mesosphere through the thermosphere, (b) the impact of derived neutral winds on the interpretation of gravity wave dissipation and forcing, and (c) climatological variations of the lower thermospheric winds and the response of the high-latitude lower thermospheric winds to forcing.",

            "abstract": "Crust-mantle coupling along major strike-slip fault zones suggests that these two lithospheric layers act as an integrated system. In such a system, the spatial and temporal evolution of mantle strength across strike-slip shear zones has proven a key component in understanding lithospheric deformation and rheology. The Bogota Peninsula shear zone is exposed in the mantle section of the New Caledonia ophiolite. It contains a unique microstructural and textural record across a 4-km wide mylonitic zone bordered by a wider zone of weaker deformation. The shear zone is interpreted as a paleotransform fault, based on the orientations of fabrics and dikes inside and outside the zone. No ultramylonites or pseudotachylites were observed within the shear zone. Olivine grain size paleopiezometers suggest variation of the shear zone stresses, with the highest values recorded in the center of the shear zone, coincident with increasing olivine CPO strength toward the shear zone center. By estimating the finite strain in the zone, and assuming that all portions of the shear zone were active synchronously, we can correlate the increased stresses to increased strain rates.\nWe compare the mantle strength in the Bogota Peninsula shear zone to other transform faults, such as the San Andreas fault (SAF) system. The differential stresses in the upper mantle of the SAF system, determined from xenoliths, is similar to those observed in the New Caledonia. Further, the width of shearing deformation in Bogota Peninsula shear zone is similar to that inferred for other transform zones, in both the upper crust and lithospheric mantle. These similarities suggest that viscous flow in the lithospheric mantle is in mechanical communication to brittle deformation in the upper crust. We propose a “Lithospheric Feedback” model, in which displacement due to mantle flow loads the crust during interseismic cycles, while the upper crust effectively limits the strength of the lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Global mean sea level (GMSL) rise projections are insufficient for adaptation planning; local decisions require local projections that characterize risk over a range of timeframes and tolerances. We present a global set of local sea level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We present complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling [1]. We illustrate the application of this framework by estimating the joint distribution of future sea-level change and coastal flooding, and associated economic costs [1,2].\nIn much of the world in the current century, differences in median LSL projections are due primarily to varying levels of non-climatic uplift or subsidence. In the 22nd century and in the high-end tails, larger ice sheet contributions, particularly from the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS), contribute significantly to site-to-site differences. Uncertainty in GMSL and most LSL projections is dominated by the uncertain AIS component.\nSea-level rise dramatically reshapes flood risk. For example, at the New York City (Battery) tide gauge, our projections indicate a \\emph{likely} (67% probability) 21st century LSL rise under RCP 8.5 of 65--129 cm (1-in-20 chance of exceeding 154 cm). Convolving the distribution of projected sea-level rise with the extreme value distribution of flood return periods indicates that this rise will cause the current 1.80 m `1-in-100 year' flood event to occur an expected nine times over the 21st century -- equivalent to the expected number of `1-in-11 year' floods in the absence of sea-level change.\nProjected sea-level rise for 2100 under RCP 8.5 would likely place $80-$160 billion of current property in New York below the high tide line, with a 1-in-20 chance of losses >$190 billion. Even without accounting for potential changes in storms themselves, it would likely increase average annual storm damage by $2.6-$5.2 billion (1-in-20 chance of >$7 billion). Projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity would further increase damages [2].\n",

The OBS contains four component receivers, including a three component 4.5 Hz geophone unit containing three orthogonal components and a hydrophone. GI-gun shots located at 1 mile and 1.5 miles radius from the OBS, with spacing approximately 40 m along the sail line. The OBS recorded data at a sampling rate of 250 Hz and from a shot pattern that gave good azimuthal coverage around the OBS. Based on P and P-S converted waves recorded between the direct and multiple arrivals, this experiment targeted the top few hundred meters of sediment in the study area. Synthetic seismograms were calculated from a model representative of the sediment sequence at this site indicating that converted amplitudes are dominated by P to S mode-converted waves generated on reflection. After preliminary processing, including a static correction, the data were optimally rotated to radial (R) and transverse (T) components. The principal technique used to detect the anisotropy was azimuthal stacking of the radial and transverse horizontal geophone components. The R component shows azimuthal variation of traveltime indicating variation of velocity with azimuth; the corresponding T component shows azimuthal variation of amplitude and phase. From the radial component azimuthal gather and mode-converted wave amplitude variation for the first few layers and determined corresponding anisotropy parameter and VP/VS values. We attribute the observed azimuthal anisotropy to the presence of microcracks and grain boundary orientation due to stress since fracture at this depth is not likely to occur.",

Here, we examine ice nucleation activity of biological ice nuclei (IN) derived from bacteria, namely of particles generated from a suspensions of Snomax®, both above and below water vapor saturation. Measurements were done with PINC (Portable Ice Nucleus Counter, Chou et al., 2011) during a measurement campaign at LACIS (Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator, see e.g. Wex et al., 2014) in Leipzig. Immersion freezing measurements from PINC and LACIS were in agreement in the temperature regime for which both instruments operate reliably.

            "abstract": "For the tropical atmosphere on planetary scales, it is common to model the circulation using strong damping. Here, with new data analysis techniques, evidence suggests that damping can actually be neglected. Specifically, near the equator, the east--west overturning circulation is in agreement with the undamped wave response to atmospheric heating. To estimate the heating, satellite observations of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are used. Frequently OLR is used as a heuristic indicator of cloudiness. Here, the results further suggest that OLR variations are actually proportional to total diabatic heating variations, with a proportionality constant of 18 W m-2 (K/day)-1. While the agreement holds best over long time averages of years or decades, it also holds over shorter periods of one season or one month. Consequently, it is suggested that the strength of the Walker circulation -- and its evolution in time -- could be estimated using satellite data.",

Despite the primary importance of the MJO and the\ndecades of research progress since its original discovery, a generally accepted theory for its essential mechanisms\nhas remained elusive. In recent work by two of the authors, a minimal dynamical model has been\nproposed that recovers robustly the most fundamental MJO features of (i) a slow eastward speed of roughly\n5 m/s, (ii) a peculiar dispersion relation with dω/dk≈0, and (iii) a horizontal quadrupole vortex structure.\nThis model, the skeleton model, depicts the MJO as a neutrally stable atmospheric wave that involves a simple\nmultiscale interaction between planetary dry dynamics, planetary lower-tropospheric moisture, and the\nplanetary envelope of synoptic-scale activity. In this article, it is shown that the skeleton model can further\naccount for (iv) the intermittent generation of MJO events and (v) the organization of MJO events into wave\ntrains with growth and demise, as seen in nature. The goal is achieved by developing a simple stochastic\nparameterization for the unresolved details of synoptic-scale activity, which is coupled to otherwise deterministic\nprocesses in the skeleton model. In particular, the intermittent initiation, propagation, and shut\ndown of MJO wave trains in the skeleton model occur through these stochastic effects. This includes examples\nwith a background warm pool where some initial MJO-like disturbances propagate through the western region\nbut stall at the peak of background convection/heating corresponding to the Maritime Continent in nature. Also shown are examples with an idealized seasonal cycle, namely a background warm pool state of heating/moistening displacing meridionally during the year. This seasonally varying case considers both equatorial and off-equatorial components of the envelope of synoptic scale convective activity, which allows for a large diversity of meridionally symmetric and asymmetric intraseasonal events found in nature.",

To properly assess risk of future melting, it is crucial to understand the formation and growth of the GRIS during past climate regimes. However, despite decades of research, it remains debated when and in what environment GRIS got established and to what extent GRIS changed in size during past warm interglacials, such as MIS 5e some 130 kyr BP. Here, we present results from analyses of environmental DNA, 10Be/36Cl, 234U/238U, single grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), palaeomagnetics, macrofossils and molecular clock dating of basal ice from the Camp Century ice core in north western Greenland and the Kap København Formation in North Greenland. We combine these with results from the DYE 3 and GRIP ice cores from southern and central Greenland to evaluate the evolution of the GRIS. We find evidence that the present GRIS formed quickly some time before 900 kyr BP in a largely forested Greenland and that it has changed by only 30-40% of its present volume since it was established. Our DNA findings of boreal forest imply that warming of more than 10oC is needed to have an ice-free Greenland. This threshold is higher than earlier predictions and the corresponding palaeo-calibration of the GRIS contribution to sea level changes suggests a sensitivity of 0.3-0.5 m GSLR per degree Celsius of warming over Greenland. Ice core data from the deep Greenland ice cores can be used to reconstruct the size of the ice sheet during the present interglacial (the Holocene) and the last interglacial (the Eemian). Reconstructions based on stable water isotopes and gas content is used to validate the resilience of the GRIS.",

Robust techniques to estimate ALT over large areas would improve understanding of coupled dynamics between permafrost, hydrology and landsurface processes, and improve simulations of the rate and timing of release of soil carbon from permafrost settings. In particular, it would provide critically needed data to parameterize and initialize soil property information in permafrost models and evaluate model predictions for large, complex domains. In this work, we demonstrate a new data fusion approach using high-resolution remotely sensed data for estimating cm scale ALT in a 5 km2 area of ice-wedge polygon terrain in Barrow, Alaska. We used topographic (directed distance, slope, wavelet-curvature) and spectral (NDVI) metrics derived from multisensor data obtained from LiDAR and WorldView-2 platforms to develop a simple data fusion algorithm using statistical machine learning. This algorithm was used to estimate ALT (2 m spatial resolution) across the study area. A comparison of the estimates with ground-based measurements documented the accuracy (±4.4 cm, r2=0.76) of the approach. Our findings suggest that the broad climatic variability associated with warming air temperature will govern the regional averages of ALT, but the smaller-scale variability could be controlled by local eco-hydro-geomorphic variables. This work demonstrates a path forward for mapping subsurface properties over large areas from readily available remote sensing data.\nMethodology of Mapping and Characterization Polygons:\nWe convolve LiDAR elevations with multiscale wavelets and objectively chose appropriate scales to map interconnected troughs of high- and low-centered polygons. For the ice wedges where LiDAR surface expressions (troughs) are not well developed, we used a Delaunay triangulation to connect the ice-wedge network and map the topologically connected polygons.\nPolygon slopes and curvatures as a function of DD were used to develop a microtopographic classification scheme for rims/elevated ridges (Zone 1), centers (Zone 2), and troughs (Zone 3) in both high- and low-centered polygon.",

With the increase of the guide field, the symmetry of both the current system and out-of-plane magnetic field inside the magnetic island is distorted. When the guide field is sufficiently strong, the current forms a ring along the magnetic field lines inside magnetic island. At the same time, the current carried by the energetic electrons accelerated in the vicinity of the X lines forms another ring at the edge of the magnetic island. Such a dual-ring current system enhance the out-of-plane magnetic field inside the magnetic island with a dip in the center of the magnetic island. In an asymmetric current sheet, when there is no guide field, electrons flows toward the X lines along the separatrices from the side with a higher density, and are then directed away from the X lines along the separatrices to the side with a lower density. The formed current results in the enhancement of the out-of-plane magnetic field at one end of the magnetic island, and the attenuation at the other end. With the increase of the guide field, the structures of both the current system and the out-of-plane magnetic field are distorted.",

Long-term climatic data, instrumental and tree ring-based, are analyzed to ascertain patterns of drought recurrence, length, and severity in California. Municipal water delivery is examined to identify essential and unessential water uses, showing how water use is governed by unsustainable cultural practices, and how it responds to conservation initiatives and pricing. Lastly, unconventional means to increase municipal are investigated, mainly the recycling of municipal sewage. The supply-side and economic implications of using recycled sewage as a potable water source are compared with those pertinent to seawater desalination.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation distribution has received much attention in ecohydrological research because of its essential role in terrestrial hydraulic cycling. Although tightly coupled to precipitation and temperature, the real-life vegetation cover pattern under certain climate conditions is hard to be reproduced theoretically. Eagleson proposed an optimality theory on calculating the optimum vegetation cover (M, defined as fraction of total ground surface covered by vegetation) through a solution of simultaneous equations reflecting the balance of water demand and water supply. Two equations were built under a long-term equilibrium state with fixed vegetation species, climate and soil types. One represented water demand which was derived from the potential canopy conductance- the ratio of potential transpiration to potential bare soil evaporation. The other was for water supply composed of information about precipitation and soil conditions. Their joint solution would be the theoretical optimum vegetation cover. Although the optimality theory was proposed as the theoretical basis of ecohydrology, only few works have been carried out to evaluate it.\nIn this work, we tested Eagleson’s optimality in the Horqin Sand in Inner Mongolia, China, featured by natural vegetation types of grassland and bushes. MODIS datasets were used as basic data to evaluate two vegetation parameters- vegetation cover (M) and leaf area index (LAI). M was conducted from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with temporal resolution of 15 days and spatial resolution of 250 meters (from 2000 to 2012), and was averaged by 0.39 on the whole area during rainy season (May to September).LAI was used with temporal resolution of 4 days and spatial resolution of 1 kilometers (from 2003 to 2012), and mean LAI on the whole area was 0.45 during rainy season. Meteorological data over 50 years (1951-2012) were obtained from three weather stations in this area. Annual mean precipitation was 365.0mm; annual mean air temperature was 6.2℃; annual mean potential evapotranspiration was 715.4mm. Our result showed proximity to the theoretical optimal state, which meant that Eagleson’s ecohydrological optimality was practical in this area.",

            "abstract": "There has been a significant emphasis recently on the rôle of vegetation change and land degradation in drylands on carbon sequestration and the provision of related ecosystem services. Studies have typically focussed on the storage of carbon in biomass over short timescales. Over intermediate timescales, an important component of carbon-related ecohydrological processes is the way in which carbon is transferred from biomass to soil organic matter. These transfers are also significantly affected by land degradation via erosion processes which result in redistribution and net loss of carbon from the local system. Many drylands are underlain by significant stores of inorganic carbon, some of which is deposited from aeolian material, but vertical transfer from the surface stores is also an important process. Numerous studies suggest that these stores are in place from thousands to millions of years and thus contain carbon that has long been taken out of the global cycle. As progressive land degradation occurs, these stores are increasingly being exposed at the surface, and thus reactivated as part of the global cycle. In the context of climate change where increasingly stormy conditions are likely to accelerate the mobilization of sediment and associated carbon, and where increasingly acidic rainfall exacerbates dissolution of inorganic carbon, there is the potential for a significant addition to atmospheric carbon at regional and global scales. We will evaluate the relative importance of this mechanism compared to sequestration in vegetation and discuss the implications for maximizing ecosystem-service provision in drylands.",

In parallel, models of the human cognitive system have also made a notable contribution to our understanding of how people think and reason, and in particular the limitations of human cognition. In light of the challenges that climate change poses to politics and society at large, the intersection of human cognition and the climate system deserves to be examined more closely. For example, recent analyses (Lewandowsky et al., 2014, Climatic Change) have shown that the magnitude of uncertainty about future temperature increases is associated with the magnitude of future risk: That is, the greater the uncertainty, the greater the expected damage costs and risk of mitigation failure. Greater uncertainty should therefore lead to greater, not lesser, concern about climate change. However, there is evidence that uncertainty sometimes has the opposite effect on people, for example by inviting “wishful thinking.” I review some of the mismatches between the actual behavior of the climate system and people’s responses to climate change. I also identify some ways in which people and the climate behave similarly: For example, the climate system is known to include “amplifying loops” and “tipping points”, and I argue that human societies may similarly amplify small disturbances from climate change into larger ones.",

We present our experience of the Chaîne des Puys and Limagne fault UNESCO World heritage project, which shows how geoheritage can be a very successful communication tool, especially as it draws in the non-peers into the geological process at many levels. First and foremost is the local level, as no geoheritage project can be successful without local participation. Few geological localities on Earth are now devoid of human influence or habitation, and thus those who live and work on sites are the necessary first stage custodians. This means that locals must gain some understanding of their geology in order to appreciate their heritage. As such people tend to have a close relationship with their land, this is often half way done: local land use, customs are often easily integrated with geological knowledge. Once this link exists, communicating ideas that can be useful for management or for dealing with hazards is easier. Sometimes more tricky is communication to visitors, tourists and politicians who do not have such as close link to the landscape. Here, the educational strategy has to be different, with a need for them to learn what the landscape is and how it is managed, and lived in. During the development of the World Heritage Chaîne des Puys and Limagne Fault project the project team has been composed of geoscientists actively working on the area, agronomists local administration (such as natural park and local government members), and landscape specialists. Each has engaged in communication at different levels channelled either through personal contacts, or through more formal means, such as exhibitions, talks, and websites. Scientists have become communicators, and non-peers have begun to see the landscape though a geolologist eyes. A Geological landscape has begun to emerge in the popular perception.",

Although mafic rocks represent only ~10% of the Archean cratons, they may provide key evidence of the role and nature of basaltic magmatism in the formation of the Archean crust as well as the evolution of the Archean mantle.\nThis study focuses on the Archean crust from the West African Craton in Mauritania (Amsaga area). The Amsaga Archean Crust mainly consists of TTG and thrust-imbricated slices of mafic volcanic rocks, which have been affected by polymetamorphic events from the amphibolite to granulite facies.\nOur main objectives aim to the identification of the mafic lithology origin and a better understanding of their role in the continental crust emplacement.\nOur petrological observations show that these amphibolites have fine to medium granoblastic and nematoblastic textures. The amphibolites are dominated by amphibolite-facies mineral assemblages (mainly amphibole and plagioclase), but garnet and clinopyroxene occur in a few samples.\nTwo groups are distinct in their geochemical characteristics (major and trace elements), although both have tholeiitic basalt composition. The first group show LREE-enriched patterns and negative Nb-Ta anomalies. The second group is characterized by near-flat LREE patterns and flat HREE patterns. This second group clearly shows no Nb-Ta anomalies.\nThe first group could be related to arc-like basalts, as it is many similarities with some Archean amphibolites probably formed in a supra-subduction zone, for instance the volcanic rocks from the southern edge of the Isua Supracrustal Belt.\nOn the contrary, the second group has a MORB-like signature which is more unusual during the Archean. Different scenarios will be discussed regards to the Archean geodynamics.",

This study analyzes 282 shallow landslides in Taiwan during 2006-2013 to identify the rainfall conditions responsible for landslides. We used the soil water index (SWI) which can represent the conceptual soil water contents as influenced by present and antecedent rainfall. SWI is used by the Japan Meteorological Agency to assess landslide hazards in Japan. Previous studies show that SWI can successfully predict the occurrence of landslides but only for Japan. Therefore, this study examines whether SWI can be also applied to Taiwan. We used the landslide data in 2006-2012 for analyses and those in 2013 for verification. The values of SWI before the rainfall events which triggered landslides were used as the indicator of the antecedent rainfall condition. We found that under different values of SWI before rainfall events, the rainfall conditions needed for triggering landslides, such as the rainfall intensity and duration, are different. Then we classified rainfall condition for triggering landslides into two types, short duration-high intensity (SH) and long duration-low intensity (LL), based on SWI and the principal component analysis. The SH type is associated with a rapid increase of SWI with short duration, and the LL type is with a gradual rise and subsequent constancy of SWI. Based on this result, we modeled the general trend of changes in SWI for the two types. We then verified the model by analyzing 19 landslides that occurred in 2013 with 14 SH types and five LL types. We also checked hourly changes in SWI for these 19 events and found that they all followed the general trend of the inferred SH and LL curves. Based on these results, it would be possible to predict a landslide of the SH or LL type, at an early stage of a rainfall event. Our results indicate that SWI is applicable to Taiwan in assessing regional landslide hazards.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory experiments indicate that even small concentrations of CO2 in the upper mantle significantly affect the silicate melting behavior [DH06]. CO2 stabilizes carbon-rich melt at high pressure, thus vastly increasing the volume of the upper mantle expected to be partially molten [H10,DH10]. These small-degree melts have important consequences for chemical differentiation and could affect the dynamics of mantle flow. We have developed theory and numerical implementation to simulate thermo-chemically coupled magma/mantle dynamics in terms of a two-phase (rock+melt), three component (dunite+basalt+volatiles) physical model. The fluid dynamics is based on McKenzie’s equations [McK84], while the thermo-chemical formulation of the system is represented by a novel, disequilibrium approach to volatile-bearing mantle melting. An experimentally constrained ternary phase diagram, based on an effective solid solution, is used to characterize the equilibrium state in the system. This physical model is implemented as a parallel, two-dimensional finite-volume code that leverages tools from the PETSc library.\nEarly application of this simulation code to a mid-ocean ridge system suggests that the methodology captures some of the first order features of carbonated mantle melting, including deep, low-degree, volatile-rich melt formation. Melt segregation leads to continuous dynamic thermo-chemical dis-equilibration, while phenomenologically derived reaction rates continually move the system towards re-equilibration. The simulations will be used to first characterize carbon extraction from the MOR system assuming chemically homogeneous mantle, and will subsequently be extended to investigate the consequences of heterogeneity in lithology [KW12] and volatile content. Such studies will advance our understanding of the role that the mid-ocean ridge system plays in the deep carbon cycle.\nREFERENCES\nDH06 Dasgupta & Hirschmann (2006), doi:10.1038/nature04612.\nH10 Hirschmann (2010), doi:10.1016/j.pepi.2009.12.003.\nDH10 Dasgupta & Hirschmann (2010), doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2010.06.039.\nMcK84 McKenzie (1984), J.Pet.\nKW12 Katz & Weatherley (2012), doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.042.",

In combination with measurements of radiocarbon, neodymium isotopes and clumped isotopes, this archive has recently been exploited to reconstruct changes in ventilation, water mass sourcing and temperature in relation to millennial climate change.\nLead (Pb) isotopes in both corals and seawater have also been used to track anthropogenic inputs through space and time and to trace transport pathways within the oceans. Better understanding of the oceanic Pb cycle is emerging from the GEOTRACES programme. However, while Pb isotopes have been widely used in environmental studies, their full potential as a (pre-anthropogenic) paleoceanographic tracer remains to be exploited. In deep-sea corals, challenges exist from low Pb concentrations in aragonite in comparison to secondary coatings, the potential for contamination, and the efficient elemental separation required for measurement by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS).\nHere we discuss progress in measuring Pb isotopes in coral aragonite using a 207Pb-204Pb double spike on a ThermoFinnigan Triton TIMS. For a 2 ng NIST-981 Pb standard, the long term reproducibility (using 1011 Ω resistors) is ~1000 ppm (2 s.d.) on 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios. We now show that using a new 1012 Ω resistor to measure the small 204Pb beam improves the internal precision on these ratios from ~500 ppm (2 s.e.) to ~250 ppm (2 s.e.) and we envisage a potential improvement in the long term reproducibility as a consequence. We further assess the internal precision and external reproducibility of our method using a BCR-2 rock standard and an in-house coral standard. Preliminary evidence on the application of this method to natural samples is derived from cleaning experiments and replication tests on deep-sea corals from the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Monogenetic volcanoes form a large proportion of the world's volcanoes. They are in all tectonic environments and thus provide a significant link to understand fundamental geological processes such as plate tectonics. The Chaîne des Puys - Limagne fault World Heritage nomination is a prime example of this link where monogenetic volcanism, continental rifting, uplift and erosion are highlighted, and are made understandable to the lay person, though the actions on over 80 aligned monogenetic volcanoes. Such geoheritage is essential for monogenetic and other geological risks to be communicated to the wider public. The current scientific interest on monogenetic volcanoes is quite recent, and because of this, and probably their global distribution but small size, they have not received their due importance from a geoheritage standpoint. Some individual sites and some fields are protected and developed as attractions, but there has been no coherent global strategy for defining monogenetic heritage, or for linking sites. This is starting through the monogenetic commission of IAVCEI, and with wider participation of the IUGS and other bodies. The Chaîne des Puys – Limagne Fault UNESCO project is an example of how public awareness, at a global scale, and be increased through geoheritage. This is done integrating local stakeholders: population, industry, science, landscapers, artists, sports, government. This builds on existing protection and sustainable activities, integrating them with education programs. The result is to create a populace that 'thinks geological', and which leads visitors to also become geologically aware. This is helped by a monogenetic landscape that is easily readable and by links made to other geological sites around the world. We will explain how this process is ongoing. The project started over 35 years ago, and is a long-term vision to develop geological understanding and protection of this unique monogenetic and tectono-volcanic site.",

            "abstract": "The Chaîne des Puys volcanic field in central France, became a celebrated mecca for 18/19th Century Scientists, only once the volcanoes were 'discovered'. Beforehand they were only hills, but the ability to interpret landscape with prior knowledge allowed these early geologists to create a popular understanding of the geology. Since that time, the Chaîne des Puys has become a well-known volcanic site to a worldwide audience through textbooks, tourism, and commerce (Look at a Volvic water bottle!). To the 19th century geologists, the Limagne escarpment was just as fascinating, but lacking the ability to fully interpret this rift margin, the idea of a fault did not percolate down to the general public. With the advent of the current UNESCO project, it became clear that the geological link between the volcanoes and the fault could be exploited, not only to raise the profile of the volcanoes, but to create a greater awareness of the tectonics in the greater public. Not only have the volcanoes, become better known and more clearly understood than previously, but the fault has begun to emerge as a feature in public consciousness. We will demonstrate the many communication techniques at all levels that have been used in the project. We explain the rationale between creating a geological scale model that works on processes as well as landforms to raise the public awareness. The success is that we show how geological features can be made readable by the general public, something highly important for conservation of heritage, but also for risk perception. The increased education efforts of the scientists have also lead to an increase in science. The Chaîne des Puys and Limagne fault project was discussed at the 38th session of the World Heritage UNESCO committee in June 2014 and was acknowledged to have Universal Exceptional Value: the future challenge for this project is to consolidate the outreach, and to work with other sites to increase the public perception of earth sciences. The more informed and participatory the public is the more efficient the communication can be.",

Case studies include teaching Red Cross community-based volunteers the Probability Distribution Function of seasonal rainfall forecasts, as well as requiring students of Columbia University’s Master’s Program in Climate and Society to study both natural and social aspects of climate.

            "abstract": "The permeability structure of the sub-ridge mantle plays an important role in how melt is focused and extracted at mid-ocean ridges. Permeability is controlled by porosity and the grain size of the solid mantle matrix, which is in turn controlled by the deformation conditions. To date, models of grain size evolution and mantle deformation have not been coupled to determine the influence of spatial variations in grain-size on the permeability structure at mid-ocean ridges. Rather, current models typically assume a constant grain size for the whole domain [1]. Here, we use 2-D numerical models to evaluate the influence of grain-size variability on the permeability structure beneath a mid-ocean ridge and use these results to speculate on the consequences for melt focusing and extraction.\nWe construct a two-dimensional, single phase model for the steady-state grain size beneath a mid-ocean ridge. The model employs a composite rheology of diffusion creep, dislocation creep, dislocation accommodated grain boundary sliding, and a brittle stress limiter. Grain size is calculated using the \"wattmeter\" model of Austin and Evans [2]. We investigate the sensitivity of the model to global variations in grain growth exponent, potential temperature, spreading-rate, and grain boundary sliding parameters [3,4]. Our model predicts that permeability varies by two orders of magnitude due to the spatial variability of grain size within the expected melt region of a mid-ocean ridge. The predicted permeability structure suggests grain size may promote focusing of melt towards the ridge axis. Furthermore, the calculated grain size structure should focus melt from a greater depth than models that exclude grain-size variability.\nFuture work will involve evaluating this hypothesis by implementing grain-size dynamics within a two-phase mid-ocean ridge model. The developments of such a model will be discussed.\n",

            "abstract": "The important role of floodplains in providing temporary storage for a large fraction of the annual sediment load of rivers is well established, but this understanding is largely based on observations of the long-term average behavior of the catchment. Here we combine measurements of the fallout radionuclides Be-7 and Pb-210 and the stable isotopes of water to quantify fine sediment mobilization and storage in a stream and its floodplain during individual intermediate-sized storm events. We demonstrate this method using five intermediate-sized storm events in a small (~15 square km), undeveloped, gravel-bedded tributary of the Connecticut River (USA). We find that in each storm, the mass of sediment deposited onto the margins accounts for almost 90% of the sediment mobilized from the bed, with the remainder of the mobilized bed sediment carried downstream as suspended load. The result that the bed is a net source of sediment to the stream and the margins a net sink is robust, but estimates of the mass of material eroded from the bed and deposited on the margins are less certain. The source of sediment to the bed remains unclear as, consistent with earlier studies, we observe only limited deposition of sediment to the bed during the storm events. The suspended sediment is organic rich and thus its source may be associated with organic decay between storm events. The understanding of the coupled interactions between discharge magnitude and frequency and sediment resupply at the event time scale has important implications for the successful restoration design of discharges that connect channel and floodplain, and for the development of accurate sediment budgets and predictions of sediment flux from a watershed.",

            "abstract": "Complex feedbacks between katabatic winds and the cryosphere may lead to the development of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described and named megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, spectroscopic data and radar soundings, acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. They have similarities with Antarctic megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Based on this analogy, we are currently developing a model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of ice sheets. In Antarctica the accumulation processes on megadunes fields is generally attributed to the wind-blown snow transport while on sedimentation waves of the North Polar Cap of Mars the accumulation seems to be dominated by sublimation/condensation processes at the surface. The model is designed to explore the implication of the water vapor mass transfer and heat transfer on the development of sedimentation waves both on Mars and Earth.",

Roklanský/Javoří brooks are observed in a 10 km long segment on the flat area of the Šumava Plateau, the Losenice R. was followed on a 7 km segment in a deeply incised, steep-sloped valley.\n First, the hydromorphological mapping of the floodplain and channel landforms took place to collect information on position of the fluvial landforms. The mapping was performed using the HEM methodics, developed by the authors. The Electric Resistivity Tomography was used in 20 profiles across the valleys. These cross-sections formed a backbone of the research aiming to observe the depth and distribution of the coarse sediment valley fill (above bedrock) both across the valleys and along. Next we employed digital optical granulometry using Sedimetrics software on the mapped gravel bodies, classic sieve granulometry on sandy accumulations, and on-site, in-channel boulder granulometry. Finally, magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on suitable sediment profiles along the courses to assess the provenience of the material.\n There are several notions, indicated by the results of the abovementioned analyses. First, the valley floor sedimentary infill is surprisingly shallow (10-15 m), notably in the case of Javoří and Roklanský brook where the valley floor often exceeds 200 - 300 m. Also, the MS points to rather fast changes in the main sediment sources. Observations of the sediment character in the Losenice valley indicate significant role of the slope/channel coupling, namely persisting influence of large, slope-based sources of angular material (rockslides, debris flows), as well as strong impact of flood events on the valley floor morphology.",

Understanding the magnitude and timing of pollutant export, as well as the pathways by which different constituents are delivered to a water course, is paramount. One approach to gaining this type of knowledge is to observe pollutant fluxes at the watershed outlet.\nThe River Eden Demonstration Test Catchments programme uses in-situ monitoring equipment to provide high-resolution (30 minute) data for three mixed-agriculture watersheds (ca. 10km2) in north western England. Determinands measured include turbidity, phosphorus, nitrate, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature, along with river discharge and rainfall. Provided with these data, and an awareness of significant agricultural activities carried out in the watershed on an annual basis, this study demonstrates how it is possible to identify different pollutant transfer pathways, along with their spatio-temporal nature, and their relative importance. This information is then used to inform appropriate mitigation design. In relation to this purpose, the pros and cons of the different hydrochemical and hydrophysical data are described, and recommendations made for other determinands that should be considered for measurement in future similar studies.",

Neither local measurements in boreholes nor analysis at the spring can take into account the variability of the water storage. Since 10 years, ground-based gravity measurements (absolute FG5 and relative CG5) allow the monitoring of the water storage in heterogeneous hydrosystems at intermediate scale between boreholes (local scale) and spring (global scale).\nSince threeyears, a geophysical observatory has been setup in the Mediterranean area (on the Durzon karstic basinin the south of France). Water level in boreholes and rainfall from rain gaugesare classical hydrological observations. They arecompleted by evapotranspiration measurements from a flux tower and continuous gravity measurements from the GWR iGrav#002 superconducting gravimeter. The main objective of thisstudy is to modelthe wholedata sets withexplicit numericalmodels.\nHydrus-1D software allows explicit modeling of water storage and 1D-flow in variably saturated media. With a stochastic sampling, we find the underground parameters (porosity, permeability) that reproduce the most the different observations (gravity, water level, evapotranspiration and rainfall). From the results of the modeling, we discuss the size of the area observed by each type of measurements. Furthermore, water storage and transfer variability may be inferred from the synergy of local (boreholes) and more integrative (gravity) measurements. This study shows the potential of gravity measurements at aquifer scale.",

            "abstract": "Diatom frustules contain embedded organic matter such as amino acids, which may offer a potential phase for measuring the carbon isotopic fractionation during marine photosynthesis (εp). We describe optimal sample preparation methods for cleaning external organic matter and separating frustules into various size classes while reducing significance of opal from radiolaria and silicoflagellates. Analysis of discrete separated fractions of diatom opal from each sediment sample is facilitated by our new method for analysis of very small sample sizes using NanoEA with cryotrapping of evolved CO2. We evaluate the fidelity with which frustule-bound organic matter captures the variation in εp by comparing δ13C of frustule-bound organic matter with that of total cellular carbon in diatoms grown in culture, and by comparing the δ13C of frustule-bound organic matter in core tops with that of δ13C of diatom-produced biomarkers in the overlying water column. In core-top transects, frustule-bound δ13C is consistent with strong growth rate control over fractionation during photosynthesis (εp). Finally, we evaluate the temporal trends in carbon isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis since the Late Miocene in samples from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) is a standardized control method that has been developed by the Monitoring Agriculture Resources (MARS Unit) of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). It relies on remote sensing time series data and is officially recognized by the EU as equivalent to actual farm visits. Member states agencies use CwRS to carry out part or all of their on-the-spot controls of EU farms to monitor Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) subsidies. The main component of CwRS is Computer-Aided Photo-Interpretation (CAPI), whose goal is determining the crop occupation of agricultural parcels listed in farmers' subsidies applications. In 2012, the CAP CwRS program enabled the oversight of 349,000 farmers for their area-aid applications, representing 89% of the total EU27 required controls.\nThe goal of this study was to develop a simple and reproducible method to automatize the CAPI process. The main feature of this method is that it allows choosing a confidence level on the automatic classification of farmer’s parcels. While higher confidence levels reduce the risk of misclassifications, lower levels increase the number of automatic control decisions that do not require the intervention of a photo interpreter, reducing the overall CwRS costs.\nWe used extensive 2005 validated control data from the Portuguese Control and Paying Agency for Agriculture (IFAP) and a multi-temporal Landsat 7 time series to train and test our methodology. Our overall results indicate that for 95% confidence level, approximately 20% of decisions can be taken automatically and for 80% confidence level the percentage of automatic decisions increases to 55%. For each studied land cover class, the adjacent figure shows the effect of the confidence level on the percentage of parcels that can be classified automatically. Since our approach holds for multiple sensors, we believe that the current results will be further improved with additional data. Our results compare favorably with standard pixel-based classifications since we take advantage of the available farmer's declarations, which are by nature object-based. IFAP is currently interested in implementing this procedure in order to reduce CAPI costs.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have identified a lengthening of the dry season over the southern Amazon during the last three decades. This work suggests that this lengthening is correlated with an earlier demise of the North American monsoon, mainly observed after the mid 1990’s. In addition, changes in both systems appear to be induced by common forcing factors at different time scales, like the shifting patterns of El Niño-Southern Oscillation anomalies, the westward expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and the global warming influence. However, whether the observed changes of dry season rainfall deficit over the Amazonia could influence the retreat of the North American monsoon is not clear. This work aims to identify the processes that could enable a possible influence of a longer and stronger dry season in the Amazon forests on the cross-equatorial flow and the demise of the North American monsoon. To address this possible inter-hemispheric link may be important in understanding the future climate variability of the American monsoons when the effects of anthropogenic forced change and conversion from Amazon forests to savannah become more dominant. The latter would be particularly relevant in order to understand the role of ecosystem changes on modulating climate over the Americas.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon is the third largest carbon reservoir and is composed of both organic and inorganic constituents. However, the storage and flux of soil carbon within the global carbon cycle are not fully understood. While organic carbon is often the focus of research, the factors controlling the formation and dissolution of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) are complex.\nClimate is largely accepted as the primary control on SIC, but the effects of soil parent material are less clear. We hypothesize that effects of parent material are significant and that SIC accumulation will be greater in soils formed from basalts than granites due to the finer textured soils and more abundant calcium and magnesium cations.\nThis research is being conducted in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho. The watershed is an ideal location because it has a range of gradients in precipitation (250 mm to 1200 mm), ecology (sagebrush steppe to juniper), and parent materials (a wide array of igneous and sedimentary rock types) over a relatively small area. Approximately 20 soil profiles will be excavated throughout the watershed and will capture the effects of differing precipitation amounts and parent material on soil characteristics. Several samples at each site will be collected for analysis of SIC content and grain size distribution using a pressure calcimeter and hydrometers, respectively.\nInitial field data suggests that soils formed over basalts have a higher concentration of SIC than those on granitic material. If precipitation is the only control on SIC, we would expect to see comparable amounts in soils formed on both rock types within the same precipitation zone. However, field observations suggest that for all but the driest sites, soils formed over granite had no SIC detected while basalt soils with comparable precipitation had measurable amounts of SIC. Grain size distribution appears to be a large control on SIC as the sandier, granitic soils promote deeper percolation.\nThis ongoing research will clarify the processes involved in SIC formation and identify the situations where it is an atmospheric source or sink.",

BARREL flew in association with the much larger Van Allen Probes mission and BARREL payloads made a simple niche measurement that has contributed substantially to that larger mission.

Prediction and understanding of MOC variability will require better comprehension of the latitudinal and temporal scales associated with MOC changes across the Atlantic. Continuous basin-wide MOC volume transport time series observations are available at 26.5°N from the RAPID-MOC/MOCHA/WBTS array for nearly a decade, and a 20-month continuous basin-wide MOC time series is available at 34.5°S based on the pilot arrays of the developing SAMBA array. At 26.5°N the longer record indicates that the bulk (nearly 50%) of the time variability in the record is at sub-annual periods – this energetic ‘high frequency noise’ illustrates the need for continuous-in-time (daily) measurements. The MOC at 34.5°S is similarly ‘noisy’ at sub-annual periods, and based on this short record there is no indication of coherence between the MOC time series at the two latitudes. Structure and variability comparisons between the two latitudes will be presented and discussed in the context of recent numerical model results, illustrating not only the veracity but also the limitations of the model results.",

This project aimed to make the dataset publicly available, accessible, and usable in order to provide a unique resource to allow and promote studies of new climate characteristics.\nWhen the curation project started, it had been five years since the data files were generated. Also, although the Principal Investigator (PI) had generated a user document at the end of the project in 2009, the document had not been maintained. Furthermore, the PI had moved to a new institution, and the remaining team members were reassigned to other projects. These factors made data curation in the areas of verifying data quality, harvest metadata descriptions, documenting provenance information especially challenging. As a result, the project’s curation process found that:\nData curator’s skill and knowledge helped make decisions, such as file format and structure and workflow documentation, that had significant, positive impact on the ease of the dataset’s management and long term preservation. \nUse of data curation tools, such as the Data Curation Profiles Toolkit’s guidelines, revealed important information for promoting the data’s usability and enhancing preservation planning.\nInvolving data curators during each stage of the data curation life cycle instead of at the end could improve the curation process’ efficiency.\nOverall, the project showed that proper resources invested in the curation process would give datasets the best chance to fulfill their potential to help with new climate pattern discovery.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the environmental factors controlling the origin and shifting abundance of C4 grasses in Earth’s history is useful for projecting the response of C4-grass dominated grasslands to future environmental change. Unfortunately, grass pollen is typically morphologically indistinct, making palynological analysis a blunt tool for studying C4-grasses in the paleorecord. δ13C of individual grass-pollen grains using a spooling wire microcombustion device interfaced with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Single Pollen Isotope Ratio AnaLysis, SPIRAL) overcomes this challenge and the potential biases of δ13C data from other substrates (e.g. leaf waxes). To assess the presence and relative abundance of C3- and C4-grass pollen in samples of unknown composition, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model, trained with ~1,900 δ13C values from pollen grains of 31 grass species. Surface-sediment data from Africa, Australia, and North America demonstrate the reliability of this technique for quantifying C4-grass abundance on the landscape. To investigate the timing and control of the origin of C4-grasses we analyzed samples from the Oligocene-Miocene from Europe and from the Eocene from North America. Results indicate that C4 grasses appeared on the landscape of southwest Europe no later than the early Oligocene, implying that low atmospheric pCO2 may not have been the main driver and/or precondition for the development of C4 photosynthesis in the grass family. In contrast, we found no evidence for C4 grasses in the southeast United States before pCO2 fell. In application of SPIRAL to the late Quaternary, we found that shifts in pCO2 and moisture balance exerted key controls on the relative abundance of C3 and C4 grasses in Africa and Australia. Overall, our results imply that as in the past, future changes in the C3/C4 composition of grass-dominated ecosystems will likely exhibit striking spatiotemporal variability as a result of differing combinations of environmental controls.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the impact of lateral variations of absorption and scattering properties on the energy envelopes of coda waves. To model the spatio-temporal distribution of seismic energy, we employ a scalar version of the radiative transfer equation with spatially-dependent absorption and scattering quality factor. The scattering pattern which describes the angular distribution of energy upon scattering is assumed to be statistically isotropic, independent of position, but otherwise arbitrary. Further assuming that the lateral variations of the governing parameters are sufficiently weak, we employ perturbation theory to derive linearized relations between the absorption/scattering properties of the medium and the intensity detected in the coda. These relations take the form of weighted integrals where so-called scattering/absorption sensitivity kernels play the role of weighting function. The kernels depend on the type of perturbation (scattering or absorption), the lapse time in the coda, and require the knowledge of the complete angular dependence of the specific intensity describing the flow of energy in a given direction at a given location. In the long lapse-time limit, we establish simplified formulas which depend on the first two angular moments of the specific intensity only. As an illustration of the theory, we calculate the absorption and scattering sensitivity kernels in a 2-D isotropically scattering medium at different lapse times in the coda, and discuss their singularities in detail. The sensitivity kernels are then employed to calculate the relative intensity variations of the coda caused by a localized Gaussian absorption/scattering anomaly. We find that the dominant effect of absorption anomalies is to modify the decay rate of the coda, while scattering anomalies have a more complex signature, causing either positive or negative deflection of the energy envelope, depending on their location and on the lapse time. Our results suggest the possibility to locate and discriminate between scattering and absorption anomalies from the energy envelope of coda waves.",

            "abstract": "Inland water sensor data acquisition is dominated by a fixed station reference frame, where water passes over a stationary sensor. These single point measurements are useful in understanding temporal patterns, but the assumptions needed to apply them to entire ecosystems are rarely tested. No single location within a stream reach or on a lake’s surface appropriately represents the inherent spatial variability, and extrapolations from these single points should be used with caution. In this context, we illustrate the approach of “taking the sensor to the water,” in either a quasi-Lagrangian or spatially explicit view. We present a sensor platform capable of rapid and dynamic (0-60 km hr-1) spatial sampling in navigable waters using multiple flow-through systems and a unique intake manifold connected to a small boat. We highlight data collected on medium-sized lakes (1.6 to 39 km2), and a heterogeneous reach of the upper Mississippi River (35 km). We use these datasets to infer hypolimnetic upwelling sensed from temperature and dissolved oxygen in a eutrophic lake and estimate the relative contributions of riverine and littoral methane production and epilimnetic transport. In addition to mapping the mixing dynamics of surface waters, we can estimate biogeochemical transformations by comparing multiple sensor outputs and applying conservative mixing models. We present apparent loss of riverine fDOM entering a eutrophic lake, effects of a constructed fringing wetland on solutes and nitrate cycling in a large river reach. This relatively simple platform uses sensors designed for the traditional fixed reference framework and will contribute to a new understanding of the spatial heterogeneity inherent in aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Reversals and excursions of the geomagnetic field are recorded globally by sedimentary and volcanic rocks. These geodynamo instabilities provide a rich set of chronostratigraphic tie points for the Quaternary period that can provide tests of age models central to paleoclimate studies. Radioisotopic dating of volcanic rocks, mainly 40Ar/39Ar dating of lava flows, coupled with astronomically-dated deep sea sediments, reveals 10 polarity reversals and 27 field excursions during the Quaternary (Singer, 2014). A key question concerns the uncertainties associated with radioisotopic dates of those geodynamo instabilities that have been identified both in terrestrial volcanic rocks and in deep sea sediments. These particular features offer the highest confidence in linking 40Ar/39Ar dates to the global marine climate record. Geological issues aside, for rocks in which the build-up of 40Ar by decay of 40K may be overwhelmed by atmospheric 40Ar at the time of eruption, the uncertainty in 40Ar/39Ar dates derives from three sources: (1) analytical uncertainty associated with measurement of the isotopes; this is straightforward to estimate; (2) systematic uncertainties stemming from the age of standard minerals, such as the Fish Canyon sanidine, and in the 40K decay constant; and (3) systematic uncertainty introduced during analysis, mainly the size and reproducibility of procedural blanks. Whereas 1 and 2 control the precision of an age determination, 2 and 3 also control accuracy. In parallel with an astronomical calibration of 28.201 Ma for the Fish Canyon sanidine standard, awareness of the importance of procedural blanks, and a new generation multi-collector mass spectrometer capable of exceptionally low-blank and isobar-free analysis, are improving both accuracy and precision of 40Ar/39Ar dates. Results from lavas recording the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal, the Santa Rosa excursion, and the reversal at the top of the Cobb Mtn subchron demonstrate these advances. Current best ages for these instabilities are 777 ± 2, 932 ± 3, and 1189 ± 1 ka (±1σ), respectively. These ages, likely accurate and precise to better than ±0.3%, are identical to those determined from deep sea sediment cores for which high-resolution magnetostratigraphy and O isotope-based age models have been developed (Channell et al., 2010).",

            "abstract": "Unanticipated peak inflows that can exceed the inflow design flood (IDF) for spillways and result in possible storage loss in reservoirs from increased sedimentation rates lead to a greater risk for downstream floods. Probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and probable maximum flood (PMF) are mostly used to determine IDF. Any possible change of PMP and PMF due to future land use and land cover (LULC) change therefore requires a methodical investigation. However, the consequential sediment yield, due to altered precipitation and flow patterns into the reservoir has not been addressed in literature. Thus, this study answers the following question: “What is the combined impact of a modified PMP on PMF and sediment yield for an artificial reservoir? The Owyhee dam of Owyhee River watershed (ORW) in Oregon is selected as a case study area for understanding the impact of LULC change on PMF and sedimentation rates. Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) is used for simulating stream flow (PMF) and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate sediment yield over ORW as a result of change in precipitation intensity and LULC. Scenarios that represent pre-Owyhee dam (Pre-Dam) and post Owyhee dam (Non-Irrigation, Control, 1992, 2001, 2006) are used to simulate PMF’s and consequential sediment yield. Peak PMF result for Pre-Dam scenarios is found to increase by 26m3s-1 (1%) and 81m3s-1 (3%) from Non-Irrigation and Control scenario, respectively. Considering only LULC change, sediment yield decreased over ORW due to the transformation of LULC from grassland to shrubland (from Pre-Dam period to the post-Dam years). However, increase in precipitation intensity caused a significant (0.1% storage loss over 21days storm period) increase in sediment yield resulting in largely reservoir sedimentation. This study underscores the need to consider future impact of LULC change on IDF calculation as well as sedimentation rates for more robust reservoir operations and planning.",

One of the goals of IODP Expedition 352 is to test the supra-subduction zone ophiolite model by drilling forearc crust at the northern Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) system. IBM forearc drilling is expected to sample sediment, lavas, and dikes. We will compare seismic velocities and other physical properties with lava and dike composition and stratigraphy at the Expedition 352 sites, particularly focusing on changes across the lava-dike transition. The IBM forearc results will be compared with observations of intermediate-spreading and fast-spreading rate oceanic crust drilled at Sites 504B and 1256D. Specific questions that will be addressed include: 1) At Site 504B the seismic layer 2/3 boundary is located near the top of the dike unit, while at Site 1256D it is located near the top of the gabbro unit. Is the lava-dike boundary at Expedition 352 associated with a seismic boundary, and if so, is it equivalent to the seismic layer 2/3 boundary? 2) At Sites 504B and 1256D there is a correlation between seismic velocities, porosities, and the presence of hydrothermal minerals. Is there a similar correlation at the Expedition 352 sites?",

            "abstract": "Life in the Universe is dominated by microbes: they are numerically the most abundant cells in our bodies and in Earth’s biosphere, and they are the only life that might be present elsewhere in our solar system. Life beyond our solar system could include macroscopic organisms, but everything we understand about the origin of life suggests it must start with microbes. Thus, understanding microbial ecosystems, in the absence of macroscopic organisms, is critical to understanding early life on Earth and life elsewhere in the Universe – if it exists. But what are the general principles of microbial ecology in the absence of predation? What happens when each cell is a chemical factory that can swap among metabolic processes in response to environmental and emergent cues? Geobiologists and astrobiologists are addressing these questions in diverse ways using both Earth’s modern biosphere and its fossil record. Modern microbial communities in shallow, ice-covered lakes, Antarctica (Fig.), provide a model for high productivity microbial ecosystems with no to low predation. In these lakes, photosynthetic communities create macroscopic pinnacles and domes, sometime lithified into stromatolites. They provide an ecological, geochemical and morphological model for Precambrian microbial communities in low sedimentation, low current environments. Insights from these communities include new growth processes for ancient mats, especially some that grew prior to the oxidation of Earth’s atmosphere. The diversity of biosignatures created in these communities also provides context for models of life under ice elsewhere in our solar system such as paleolakes on Mars and on icy moons. Results from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) team document formerly habitable fluvial and lacustrine environments. Lacustrine environments, in particular, are favorable for preserving biosignatures, and continued investigations by MSL will provide a deeper understanding of the duration of habitable environments and the preservation potential of biosignatures in those environments. A specific search for evidence of microbial ecosystems is warranted, but investigation of old sedimentary rocks on Earth demonstrates that biosignature preservation is rare.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind interaction with earths’s magnetosphere begins well ahead of the magnetopause when the solar wind encounters the foreshock, bow shock and magnetosheath. In these regions a variety of waves and magnetic structures exist and modify the solar wind. The foreshock is permeated by a variety of ultra low frequency (ULF) waves and magnetic transient structures such as shocklets, SLAMs, and cavitons. These structures are very compressive and are generated by the solar wind interaction with backstreaming particles plus non linear processes. Other structures such as hot flow anomalies (HFA), and spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFA) can also exist in the foreshock. HFAs are generated by discontinuities that arrive to the bow shock. Recent studies show that SHFA have the same profiles as HFA, but form by the interaction of foreshock cavitons with the bowshock. Foreshock bubbles can form when energetic ions upstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock interact with rotational discontinuities in the solar wind. All these structures can merge with the bow shock and be convected into the magnetosheath. The magnetosheath is both a place for rich plasma physical processes and a filter between solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma and magnetic field environments. It is permeated by the superposition of upstream convected structures plus locally generated waves (ion cyclotron and mirror mode). Recent studies have shown that jets and magnetosheath filamentary structures (MFS) can be observed downstream from the bow shock. Jets are associated to shock rippling efects and MFS to acceleration of particles at and near the shock. Due to the presence of the foreshock, bow shock and magnetosheath transients, the solar wind arriving to the magnetopause is very different to the pristine solar wind. In this talk we will address the main characteristics of these transients, discuss their origin, and how they can modify the solar wind, the bow shock, the magnetosheath and the magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "A structural, ontological presentation of the discipline domain concepts and their relationships is a powerful e-science tool: it enables data search and discovery by content of the observations. Even a simple classification of the concepts using the parent-child hierarchies enables analyses by association, thus bringing a greater insight in the data.\nOntology specifications have been put to many uses in space physics, primarily to harmonize data analysis across multiple data resources and thus facilitate interoperability. Among the multitude of ontology writeups, the SPASE data model stands out as a prominent, highly detailed collection of keywords for heliophysics. We will present an ontology design that draws its strengths from SPASE and further enhances it with a greater structural organization of the keyword vocabularies, in particular related to wave phenomena, as well as describes a variety of events and activities in the Sun-Earth system beyond the quiet-time behaviour.\nThe new ontology is being developed for the Near Earth Space Data Infrastructure for e-Science (ESPAS) project funded by the 7th European Framework, whose data model is based on a suite of ISO 19156 standards for Observations and Measurements (O&M). The O&M structure and language have driven the ESPAS ontology organization, with the Observed Property vocabulary as its cornerstone. The ontology development has progressed beyond the O&M framework to include domain-specific components required to describe the space physics concepts in a dictionary-controlled, unambiguous manner. Not surprisingly, wave phenomena and events presented the greatest challenge to the ESPAS ontology team as they demanded characterization of processes involved in the wave generation, propagation, modification, and reception, as well as the propagation medium itself. One of the notable outcomes of this effort is the ability of the new ontology schema to accommodate and categorize, for example, the URSI standard ionospheric characteristics such as the O-wave critical frequency of the F2 layer, foF2.\n\nThe efforts are underway to interface new ontology definitions with similar designs in other e-Science projects.",

            "abstract": "Current models and simulations of rotating fluid turbulence in the atmosphere and oceans, and planetary interiors are conducted in parameter regimes that are typically far removed from realistic values. Addressing this problem with present day models through improvements in computing power via Moore's law (giving a doubling of resolution in each direction every six years for three-dimensional problems) will produce slow advances at best. Advances may also occur through new model development and associated simulations utilizing extreme parameter values in an asymptotic manner. Such an approach will require a body of knowledge gained from large-scale direct numerical simulations and laboratory experiments that explore the nature of extreme values in controlled settings.\nIn this talk I will present and discuss results obtained from simulations of the asymptotic PDEs relevant for rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection. A particular strength of the reduced model PDE's is that they filter fast inertial waves and relax the need to resolve thin viscous (Ekman) boundary layers. This approach identifies four distinct flow morphologies (cellular convection, convective Taylor columns, plume convection and geostrophic turbulence) that remain challenging for laboratory experiments and DNS to capture in its entirety. Despite this challenge experiments and DNS offer an important benchmark for validation of the asymptotic theory. In comparison with laboratory experiments and DNS we show that the asymptotic model provides a good description of the fluid interior. However, in the presence of no-slip boundaries it is demonstrated that Ekman boundary layers can destabilize thermal boundary layers and result in significant enhancement in heat transport throughout the layer. We argue that this always occurs at some point on the rotationally constrained branch of thermal convection and thus of potential importance to geophysical and astrophysical scenarios. We show that the effect of Ekman pumping may be captured by classical pumping boundary conditions and again eliminates the need to resolve the Ekman boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was organized to encourage countries to take action to address issues of declining biodiversity. In2010, the CBD identified specific goals for 2011-2020 (the “Aichi Targets”) and a tiered system of indicators necessary to achieve those targets. Essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) are the standardized measurements and observations at the base of this system; they are the basic level of information that is necessary to calculate these indicators. By providing a list of pre-defined EBVs, existing research and research planned for the future can align measurements to address common questions.\nWe assessed the applicability of phenology EBVs for standardizing measurements across observation networks within the US as a test case for use of the standardized used of EBVs. Phenology products from the USA National Phenology Network, a citizen science observer based program, NEON, a multi-scale ecological observatory, and remotely sensed data from USGS EROS were considered for this purpose.\nEssential Biodiversity Variables currently defined for phenology are insufficient to support consistent measurement across monitoring networks. Specifically, phenology which is a field of study, is currently listed as a single EBV within the general category of ‘species traits’. With the only guidance provided to future observation networks being that of measuring ‘phenology,’ there would likely be as many approaches to achieving this goal as networks participating. We propose more narrowly defined variables which may be more appropriate for standardization and demonstrate how these measurements satisfy the basic characteristics of an EBV in that they are relevant, sensitive to change, biological and generalizable, scalable, feasible, stable and, represent state variables. We map these variables to the tiered indicators identified by the CBD and, finally, to Aichi Targets to which they contribute.\nEBVs may be used not only to align measurements from different research projects but also to facilitate coordination between projects working at different scales; our framework provides a model that may be applied at a global scale.",

            "abstract": "Tundra snow (exclusive of drifts) tends to be a thin veneer (<1 m) modified by extensive aeolian features like dunes and barchans. These features are on the order of 0.2 to 1.0 m high, and the substrate beneath the veneer snow (often various types of tundra) can have similar local relief. Consequently, veneer snow depths exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Lateral variations of depth as high as 50% or more can be observed over a few meters. Even greater depth variations occur where the topography creates traps that hold drifts as thick as 5 m. We have been measuring and modeling the tundra snow in a nested series of basins ranging from 1 to 200 km in northern Alaska for 30 years. These efforts show that while modeling can produce reasonably accurate simulations of the deeper drifts, in many cases it does not do a good job in capturing the more subtle aspects of the snow distribution, being hampered by limited precipitation and wind data. More accurate and detailed patterns of snow distribution can be revealed through direct measurement or through melt period sequential imagery. These can improve the accuracy of weather-driven model depth distributions, but producing pattern maps remains labor- and time-intensive. Both approaches tend to do poorly at scales of 100-m or less where surface features like sastrugi and dunes alter the snow depth. These small-scale variations in depth and snow water equivalent might not seem important, but comparison of point values of snow depth from observing stations with spatial maps of the snow surrounding the stations suggests that significant differences can exist. A more comprehensive understanding of drifting and drift features is needed in order to improve our ability to model and understand this dynamic and fascinating class of snow.",

            "abstract": "Several studies indicate that sea level oscillated during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, but the details of these scenarios, including the number of sea level oscillations, are still debated. We lack a detailed understanding of the sensitivity of the large polar ice sheets to changes in temperature that could result in eustatic sea level oscillations. Because the Seychelles are located far from the margins of the Last Glacial Maximum northern hemisphere ice sheets, they have not been subjected to glacial isostatic adjustment, and have been tectonically stable since the Last Interglacial period; therefore, they provide a robust record of eustatic sea level during MIS 5e. All of the outcrops we examined contain unconformities and/or sharp transitions between facies, though the nature of these boundaries varies between sites. In some outcrops we observed a hardground comprising fine-grained, mollusc-rich sediment layer between distinct generations of in situ coralgal framework. In one outcrop, this succession was observed twice, where two generations of reef growth were each capped by a strongly indurated fine-grained, mollusc-rich sediment layer. At the site with the greatest vertical extent of outcrop, there is a marked difference in the taxonomic composition of the coral community above and below an unconformable surface, but the indurated fine-grained, sediment layer observed elsewhere was absent. Most of the other outcrops we studied contained a common succession of facies from in situ reef units overlain by cemented coral rubble. In two dated outcrops, the age of corals above and below the rubble layer are the same age. The hardgrounds and rubble layers may represent ephemeral exposure of the reef units during two drops in sea level. The inference of multiple meter-scale oscillations during the MIS 5e highstand indicates a more dynamic cryosphere than the present interglacial, although the climatic threshold for more volatile polar ice sheets is not yet clear.",

            "abstract": "This presentation reviews conceptual advances in the emerging field of socio-hydrology that focuses on coupled human and water systems. An important current challenge is how to better couple the bidirectional influences between human and water systems, which lead to emergent dynamics. The interactions among (1) the structure and dynamics of systems with (2) human values and norms lead to (3) outcomes, which in turn influence subsequent interactions. Human influences on hydrological systems are relatively well understood, chiefly resulting from developments in the field of water resources. The ecosystem-service concept of cultural value has expanded understanding of decision-making beyond economic rationality criteria. Hydrological impacts on social processes are less well developed conceptually, but this is changing with growing attention to vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience, particularly in the face of climate change. Methodological limitations, especially in characterizing the range of human responses to hydrological events and drivers, still pose challenges to modeling bidirectional human-water influences. Evidence from multiple case studies, synthesized in more broadly generic syndromes, helps surmount these methodological limitations and offers the potential to improve characterization and quantification of socio-hydrological systems.",

            "abstract": "Triple oxygen isotope ratios (18O/16O and 17O/16O) are a powerful tool to tease out interconnections within the Surface Earth System, both today and throughout Earth’s history. This ability comes from the fact that stratospheric photochemistry imparts a negative ∆17O anomaly (∆17O = δ17O – 0.52×δ18O) to atmospheric oxygen whose magnitude is proportional to pCO2 levels and photosynthetic oxygen production. Atmospheric oxygen readily weathers continental sulfides and, as a result, the secular variations in atmospheric ∆17O values may be recorded in marine sulfate minerals (barite, gypsum and anhydrite).\nThe largest ∆17O anomalies found in the rock record are from peculiar barite layers that immediately post-date the 635 Ma Marinoan Snowball Event. While these anomalies have been interpreted to result from a weak post-glacial photosynthetic O2 flux, the balance of other evidence (e.g., Zn isotope records of near-modern post-glacial productivity) suggests that they instead reflect the elevated CO2 levels thought to be required to exit a snowball state. As this situation illustrates, the ∆17O record by itself does not provide a unique solution between production of the anomaly by stratospheric reactions and its destruction by global biospheric productivity. In the context of additional geological and geochemical constraints, however, a marine sulfate ∆17O record has the potential to provide new insights into paleoatmospheres, paleoclimates, and paleoproductivity.\nWe have produced new data (n ≈ 200) for Proterozoic evaporites that extend the sulfate ∆17O record from the Neoproterozoic to ~2.3 Ga. This data will be interpreted within our current understanding of Proterozoic Earth System Evolution on basinal to global scales and will address key questions that include: Were Paleoproterozoic glacial episodes terminated by elevated pCO2? Was the Great Oxidation Event accompanied by enhanced productivity? Does the lack of C isotope variability throughout the mid-Proterozoic “Boring Billion” reflect constant primary productivity? Did a balance between CO2 levels and solar luminosity maintain the temperate mid-Proterozoic climate?",

The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) is a new (proposed) satellite-MIP within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) that is designed to address the following main science questions: (1) What are the effects of land use and land-use change on climate (past-future)? (2) What are the effects of climate change on land-use and land-use change? (3) Are there regional land management strategies with promise to help mitigate and adapt to climate change? LUMIP will coordinate across existing land use change projects such as LUCID, AgMIP, GSWP3, Trendy, and LUC4C. LUMIP encompasses three major activities: (1) input and output data harmonization and standardization, (2) development of model metrics to assess ESM performance with respect to the impact of land use on climate and carbon cycling, and (3) design and execution of a concise set of land model and ESM experiments for assessment of the impacts of historic and projected land use on the climate system and to separate effects of fossil fuel vs. land use, biogeochemical vs biogeophysical processes, and land cover vs land management.

            "abstract": "Refraction microtermor routinely assesses 1D and 2D velocity-depth profiles to shallow depths of approximately 100 m primarily for engineering applications. Estimation of both shallow and deep (>100 m) shear-velocity structure are key elements in the assessment of urban areas for potential earthquake ground shaking, damage, and the calibration of recorded ground motions. Three independent studies investigated the ability of the refraction microtremor technology to image deep velocity structure, to depths exceeding 1 km (Deep ReMi). In the first study, we were able to delineate basin thicknesses of up to 900 m and the deep-basin velocity structure beneath the Reno-area basin. Constraints on lateral velocity changes in 3D as well as on velocity profiles extended down to 1500 m, and show a possible fault offset. This deployment used 30 stand-alone wireless instruments mated to 4.5 Hz geophones, along each of five arrays 2.9 to 5.8 km long. Rayleigh-wave dispersion was clear at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz using 120 sec ambient urban noise records. The results allowed construction of a 3D velocity model, vetted by agreement with gravity studies. In a second test, a 5.8 km array delimited the southern edge of the Tahoe Basin, with constraints from gravity. There, bedrock depth increased by 250 m in thickness over a distance of 1600 m, with definition of the velocity of the deeper basin sediments. The third study delineated the collapse region of an underground nuclear explosion within a thick sequence of volcanic extrusives, using a shear-wave minivibe in a radial direction, and horizontal geophones. Analysis showed the cavity extends to 620 m depth, with a width of 180 m and a height of 220 m. Our results demonstrate that deep velocity structure can be recovered using ambient noise. This technique offers the ability to define 2D and 3D structural representations essential for seismic hazard evaluation.",

We address this issue for the United States warm season via high-resolution simulations, continental-scale radar observations, and dynamical analogs. The bias is argued to stem from the absence in climate models of orogenic propagating convective systems that provide over 50% of warm-season rainfall because: i) convective parameterizations fail to represent key dynamical processes; ii) climate model spatial resolution does not permit explicit organized convection. Particularly important are mesoscale downdrafts (Earth’s natural air-conditioners) that, on regional scales, bring air of lower thermodynamic energy above the boundary layer to the land surface. On a broader note, organized convection is central to the water-cycle, diurnal-cycle, energy and momentum fluxes, hydrology, and albedo, all of which affect the distribution and variability of surface temperature and moisture.",

            "abstract": "Sub-meter resolution airborne LiDAR topography comprises a critical part of the research infastructure along several major active faults in western North America, where it provides a topographic baseline against which future, post-earthquake LiDAR surveys can be differenced. Here, we describe two differencing methods - one based on the Iterative Closest Point algorithm, the other on cross-correlation techniques - that enable the 3-D surface deformation field to be determined. This contrasts with conventional InSAR and pixel-tracking techniques which measure line-of-sight and horizontal displacement components only. An additional advantage is that LiDAR differencing retains coherence in the presence of steep displacement gradients, such as close to surface ruptures, and it is therefore well-suited for probing the slip distribution and mechanical properties of the shallow part of the fault zone. We illustrate using two recent Mw ~7 earthquakes in Mexico and Japan which are the first near-complete ruptures to be captured in this way. For the 4 April 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah (Mexico) earthquake, the 3-D displacements are used to explore whether significant slip occurred on low-angle detachment faults, as has been postulated by some field geologists. For the 11 April 2011 Fukushima-Hamadori (Japan) earthquake, coherent LiDAR displacements from the interior part of the fault zone are used to help bridge a critical observational gap between surface faulting offsets (measured in the field) and slip occurring at depths of a few kilometers (inferred from InSAR). Challenges include the treatment of vegetation and the dependence on older, \"legacy\" LiDAR datasets - third party surveys which were not optimized for earthquake studies and for which important data acquisition and processing metrics are unavailable.",

            "abstract": "Over the past century, the geology curriculum at Oregon State University has remained constant in some areas and changed in others in response to internal (faculty and university) and external (economic, and intellectual) drivers. A decadal summary of 100 years of the geology curriculum at Oregon State University reveals socio-economic patterns. From 1913, when the School of Mines was established, to 1932, when it was dismembered, the geology curriculum was designed in support mining engineering. In that time, the geology department (est. 1914) moved from the School of Mines to the School of Science. Several decades of paleontology-intensive curriculum followed under the leadership of noted paleontologist Earl Packard, as dean and chair. The curriculum transitioned from support of the oil industry in the 60s and 70s, with a strong field emphasis engendered by “Doc” Wilkinson, to increased structure and tectonics emphasis in response to the tectonic revolution under the leadership of structural geologist Robert Yeats. In the last few decades the program has grown diverse in environmental and climatic interests.\n The early curriculum required a three-course series in determinative mineralogy plus petrography and 3 courses in petrology (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic), making a core of seven; we require 3 courses today. Like all students in the School of Mines, those with the geology specialization were required to take a field course in surveying and to spend several summer months working in the mining industry. This strong field tradition persisted through time with an introductory field methods class coupled with a summer field camp. The total number of weeks dedicated to field classes, excluding the work experience requirement, has varied from as high as 12 credit-hours to the present 6 (quarters basis). On the other hand, increased short field experiences are reflected by incorporation of more field trips in nearly all courses since the 80’s, fostered by accessible transportation.\n General education courses delivered by geology faculty have mimicked these changes, from early service courses in basic geology for engineering, mining and agriculture to a diverse slate of courses from basic geology to natural hazards and climate.",

We will review a range of experiment results that illustrate large-scale ionospheric effects when the HF frequencies used are close to electron gyro-harmoncs and we focus mainly on the 3rd and 4th harmonics. The data are primarily from the UHF diagnosticc radar and total electron content (TEC) observations through the heated topside ionosphere. Radar data for HF frequencies just above and just below gyro harmoncs show significant differences in radar scatter cross-section that suggest differing plasma processes, and this effect is HF power dependent with some effects only observable with full HF power. For the production of artificial ionization in the E-region when the HF frequency is near gyro-harmoncs the results differ significantly for relatively small (50 kHz) variations in the HF frequency. We show how slow FM scans in conjunction with gyro-harmonic effects are effective in producing artificial ionization in the lower ionosphere.\nIn the topside ionosphere enhanced density and upward fluxes have been observed and these may act as effective ducts for the propagation of VLF waves upward into the magneosphere. Experimental techniques have been developed that may be used to continuously maintain these effects in the topside ionossphere.",

To characterize the immediate and medium-term patterns of water cycling and availability following sagebrush plant community alteration, we applied the SOILWAT ecosystem water balance model to 898 sites across the distribution of sagebrush ecosystems, representing the three primary big sagebrush ecosystem types: sagebrush shrublands, sagebrush steppe and montane sagebrush. At each site we examined three vegetation conditions representing intact sagebrush, recently disturbed sagebrush and recovered but grass-dominated vegetation. Transition from shrub to grass dominance decreased precipitation interception and transpiration and increased soil evaporation and deep drainage. Relative to intact big sagebrush vegetation, simulated soils in the herbaceous vegetation phases typically had drier surface layers and wetter deep layers. Our simulations suggested that alterations in ecosystem water balance may be most pronounced in vegetation representing recently disturbed conditions (herbaceous vegetation with low biomass) and modest in conditions representing recovered, but still grass-dominated, vegetation. The ecohydrological impact of simulated big sagebrush removal depended on climate; while short-term changes in water balance were greatest in wet areas represented by the montane sagebrush ecosystem type, medium-term impacts were greatest in dry areas of sagebrush shrublands and sagebrush steppe.",

This has significant implications for global climate, hydrology, water resources, and global sea level. Physical evidences of changes observed in the cryosphere are: (a) Duration of ice cover of rivers and lakes in high latitudes of N. H. decreased by about two weeks over the 20th Century; (b) Significant retreat of glaciers world wide during the 20th Century; (c) Thinning of Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness by about 40% in late summer in recent decades, with the minimum sea ice concentration mapped by the SSM/I sensor of NASA in 2007; (d) Snow cover decreased in area by about 10% since global observations by satellites began in the late 1960s, in various places of the Northern Hemisphere; (e) In North America, snow water equivalent decreased by about 10mm since observations by passive microwave sensors began in the late 1970s; (f) Degradations of permafrost have been detected in some parts of the polar and sub-polar regions, and (g) The total 20th Century global average sea level rise was about 0.17m, likely due to decline in glaciers, snow, ice sheets, and losses from Greenland and Antarctica ice. Next, projected changes to the Cryosphere: northern hemisphere snow cover, avalanches, land ice, permafrost, freshwater ice, and sea ice changes, are presented.",

Iron cycling is inherently linked to EET, as both reduced iron (electron donors), and oxidized iron (electron acceptors) can be found as insoluble minerals, and require specialized molecular machines to accomplish these extracellular geobiological reactions. Bacteria in the group Shewanella are able to catalyze EET in both directions, and are involved with a number of different iron conversions, but are not good role models for extreme conditions – to our knowledge there are no shewanellae that are tolerant to extremes of temperature or pH, the two usual. This being said, when cells are energy starved via limitation for electron acceptors, they respond by turning on the system(s) for EET. Thus, in this presentation the known mechanism(s) of EET will be discussed, along with recent findings and reports of EET-capable organisms from a variety of extreme environments. From these data, I put forward the hypothesis that there are many microbes (many of them from extreme environments) that will be resistant to cultivation by “standard microbiological methods”, yet lend themselves well to cultivation via electrochemical methods.",

            "abstract": "Interflow can occur in any slope where higher conductivity topsoils are underlain by a low conductivity impeding layer which could include B horizons, till layers, hardpans, C horizons and bedrock of various permeabilities. Impeding layers of essentially impermeable bedrock seem to be a rarity, as studies that have evaluated interflow on slopes underlain by apparently solid crystalline rock have still found leakage into the rock. Hewlett’s concrete soil trough studies thus comprise an endpoint of interflow boundary conditions. In many hillslope environments, downslope interflow necessarily includes a normal flow component into the leaky impeding layer. By making a simplifying assumption of zero pressure at the base of the impeding layer (for perched conditions), the downslope travel distance as interflow of a parcel of water can be estimated from the ratio of the hydraulic conductivities, the ratio of the downslope and normal hydraulic gradients, and the thickness of the saturated zone above the impeding layer. For many hillslopes, downslope travel distances imply that only the slope segments adjacent to the riparian valley can be expected to deliver interflow to the valley during a storm. Over most of the hillslope, interflow acts only to redistribute recharge downslope from the point of infiltration. Therefore, continuous perching of water moving as interflow from the ridge to the valley does not imply continuous connectivity. In terms of stormflow contributions, only the lower slopes within the range of the downslope travel distance may be connected to stream valleys.",

            "abstract": "We develop numerical schemes for solving global scale Stokes flow systems employing the “sticky air” (approximate free surface) boundary condition. Our target application considers the dynamics of planetary growth involving long time-scale global core formation process, for which the interaction between the surface geometry and interior dynamics play an important role (e.g. Golabek et.al. 2009, Lin et.al. 2009). The solution of Stokes flow problems including a free surface is one of the grand challenges of computational geodynamics due to the numerical instability arising at the deformable surface (e.g. Kaus et.al. 2010, Duretz et.al. 2011, Kramer et.al. 2012).\nHere, we present two strategies for the efficient solution of the Stokes flow system using the “spherical Cartesian” approach (Gerya and Yuen 2007). The first technique addresses the robustness of the Stokes flow with respect to the viscosity jump arising between the sticky air and planetary body (e.g. Furuichi et.al. 2009). For this we employ preconditioned iterative solvers utilising mixed precision arithmetic (Furuich et.al. 2011). Our numerical experiment shows that the mixed precision approach using double-double precision arithmetic improves convergence of the Krylov solver w.r.t to increasing viscosity jump without significantly increasing the calculation time (~20%). The second strategy introduces an implicit advection scheme for the stable time integration for the deformable free surface. The Stokes flow system becomes numerically stiff when the dynamical time scale associated with the surface deformation is very short in comparison to the time scale associated with other physical process, such as thermal convection. In this work, we propose to treat the advection as a coordinate non-linearity coupled to the momentum equation, thereby defining a fully implicit time integration scheme. Such an integrator scheme permits large time step size to be used without introducing spurious numerical oscillations. The non-linear equations defined by the implicit time integration scheme are solved using a JFNK framework (Knoll and Keyes 2004). We have conducted a series of numerical experiments which clarify the trade-off’s between the computational cost associated with solving the non-linear problem and time step size.",

            "abstract": "There is debate as to whether the process of layer parallel shortening (LPS) occurs only during the initial stages of a deformation sequence or whether occurs throughout that deformation sequence. Secondly, there is no consensus on whether LPS is a continuous, steady-state process, or a pulsed process, occurring before the development of each new set of major structures. Structures such as pressure-solution cleavage, stylolite development, reduction of porosity, and pressure solution changes to grain boundaries, which result from LPS, can be identified in the field and estimates of LPS amount can be obtained. Thus it is crucial to understand how these field-based estimates, taken from the end-point of the deformation sequence, relate to the entire deformation sequence.\nFour analog models, run to different final bulk shortening (BS) amounts between 5% and 20%, were used to investigate the relative amounts of tectonic shortening and LPS, which together comprise the total BS. Once the model had been completed and sliced, representative cross-sections were digitized and restored using Move structural software. The amounts of LPS and tectonic shortening were then calculated from these restorations.\nResults indicate that the proportion of LPS, relative to tectonic shortening, is high in the initial stages of deformation (the models with low BS) but then decreases to a lower proportion of the total BS that does not change even as the total BS is increased. A second result is that LPS is most significant in deeper stratigraphic levels, although the same overall pattern as previously is followed at each level. This suggests that LPS is a significant deformation mechanism in the early stages of deformation but becomes less significant as deformation proceeds. LPS estimates from field data therefore need to be placed in the correct tectonostratigraphic and deformation sequence context in order to be properly understood.",

            "abstract": "The Tien Shan, Central Asia's major mountain range, has recently been the focus of a series of studies targeting changes in meteorological variables, glacier mass and extent, as well as runoff. Reviews have repeatedly highlighted the importance of glacier melt for total runoff on the one hand, but the scarcity of direct glaciological observation on the other. At the regional to global scale, the lack of such direct observations has been tackled by using remotely sensed products such as satellite gravimetry and altimetry, but the covered time frame is typically in the order of one decade, thus hampering robust assessments.\nHere, an ensemble of approaches based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), and in-situ glacier mass balance measurements is used for estimating glacier mass changes in the Tien Shan during the last decade, and for validating a glacier mass balance model that we subsequently use for reconstructing a continuous mass balance time series over the last half-century. The model ensemble is designed to take into account a wide range of uncertainty sources including often-neglected differences such as data sources or model structure.\nWe cross-validate our different approaches during the period 2003-2009, and find an average glacier mass change of -6.1±4.4 Gt/a, thus confirming previously published estimates. We use the glaciological modelling approach to extend our estimates over the period 1961-2012, and gain insights in the spatial and temporal evolution of the regional glacier melt. Estimated melt rates are in turn used for assessing the contribution of glacier melt to the total runoff of major hydrological basins, and indicate that the contribution from glaciers has likely been overestimated in a series of previous studies.",

            "abstract": "Global seismic tomography suffers from uncertainties in earthquake parameters routinely published in seismic catalogues. In particular, errors in earthquake location and origin-time may lead to strong biases in measured body-wave delay-times and significantly pollute tomographic models. Common ways of dealing with this issue are to incorporate source parameters as additional unknowns into the linear tomographic equations, or to seek combinations of data to minimise the influence of source mislocations.\nWe propose an alternative, physically-based method to desensitise direct S-wave delay-times to errors in earthquake location and origin-time. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that mislocation delay-time biases depend to first order on the earthquake-receiver azimuth, and to second order on the epicentral distance. Therefore, for every earthquake, we compute S-wave differential delay-times between optimised receiver pairs, such that a large part of their mislocation delay-time biases cancels out (for example origin-time fully subtracts out), while the difference of their sensitivity kernels remains sensitive to the model parameters of interest. Considering realistic, randomly distributed source mislocation vectors, as well as various levels of data noise and different synthetic Earths, we demonstrate that mislocation-related model errors are highly reduced when inverting for such differential delay-times, compared to absolute ones. The reduction is particularly rewarding for imaging the upper-mantle and transition-zone.\nWe conclude that using optimised receiver pairs is a suitable, low cost alternative to get rid of errors on earthquake location and origin-time for teleseismic direct S-wave traveltimes. Moreover, it can partly remove unilateral rupture propagation effects in cross-correlation delay-times, since they are similar to mislocation effects.",

However, the accuracy of these paleoreconstructions depends on the data set and calibration quality. Several calibration works have been defining and improving the use of proxies for productivity and nutrient cycling parameters. Our contribution is centred on a multi-proxy calibration at a regional coastal upwelling system. To minimize the existing uncertainties affecting the use of trace elements and C stable isotopes as productivity proxy in the high productivity upwelling areas, we investigate the content and distribution of Ba/Ca and δ13C in the water column, its transference into the planktonic foraminifera shells, and, how the living planktonic foraminifera Ba/Ca and δ13C signal is related to the same planktonic foraminiferal species preserved in the sediment record. This study is based on a large data set from two stations (RAIA - 75m water depth, and CALIBERIA - 350m water depth) located off the NW Iberian margin (41.5-42.5ºN; 9-10ºW), and includes: i) two year monthly water column data (temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, Ba/Ca, and δ13C-DIC); ii) seasonal Ba/Ca, δ13C in several living PF species at both stations; and iii) Ba/Ca and δ13C in several PF species from a large set of core-top sediment samples in the study region. Additionally, total organic carbon and total alkenones were also measured in the sediment. Our results showed the link between productivity proxies in the surface sediment foraminifera assemblage and the processes regulating the actual phytoplankton dynamics in an upwelling area. The understanding of this relationship has special relevance since it gives fundamental information related to the past oceanic biogeochemistry and/or climate and improves the prevision of future changes against possible climate variability due to anthropogenic forcing.",

Firstly, the master-subsidiary inheritance relations and configuration characterization of the seismic-scale extensional fault systems are determined by analyzing the structural pattern. Besides, three-dimensional (3D) pattern and characteristics of the seismic-scale extensional structure have been illustrated by 3D structure model built upon seismic sections.

We separate currents independent of PPO phase from PPO-related currents, by exploiting the expected anti-symmetry of the latter with respect to PPO phase. The PPO-independent current system is thought to be associated mainly with sub-corotation of magnetospheric plasma, and consists of a weak distributed downward current over the whole polar region, enhanced downward currents in a layer mapping to the outer magnetosphere where the ionospheric conductivity is elevated, and a main upward-directed current layer ~2° wide centered at ~18° co-latitude with respect to the southern pole carrying ~2.5 MA per radian of azimuth. The latter current maps to the main region of the hot plasma in Saturn’s magnetosphere and is co-located with Saturn’s main UV oval in this hemisphere and local time sector. No major currents are detected mapping to the inner equatorial magnetosphere ~4-8 RS dominated by cool Enceladus plasma. The PPO-related currents map to the inner part of the hot plasma region at ~18°‑20° co-latitude, and carry rotating upward and downward currents peaking at ~1.7 MA rad‑1. The co-latitude of the current layers is also modulated by 1° amplitude in the PPO cycle, with maximum equatorward and poleward excursions adjacent to maximum upward and downward PPO currents, respectively. It is shown that this phasing requires the current system to be driven upward from the planetary atmosphere rather than downward from the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "The improving temporal and spatial resolutions of new generation space-borne X-Band SAR sensors such as COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation, and therefore their better monitoring capabilities, will guarantee increasing and more efficient use of multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) in landslide investigations. Thanks to their finer spatial resolution with respect to C-band data, X-band InSAR applications are very promising also for monitoring smaller landslides and single engineering structures sited on potentially unstable slopes. This work is focused on the detection of precursory signals of an impending slope failure from MTI time series of ground deformations obtained by exploiting 3 m resolution CSK data. We show the case of retrospectively captured pre-failure strains related to the landslide which occurred on January 2014 close to the town of Marina di Andora. The landslide caused the derailment of a train and the interruption of the railway line connecting north-western Italy to France. A dataset of 56 images acquired in STRIPMAP HIMAGE mode by CSK constellation from October 2008 to May 2014 was processed through SPINUA algorithm to derive the ground surface deformation map and the time series of displacement rates for each coherent radar target. We show that a cluster of moving targets coincides with the structures (buildings and terraces) affected by the 2014 landslide. The analysis of the MTI time series further shows that the targets had been moving since 2009, and thus could have provided a forewarning signal about ongoing slope or engineering structure instability. Although temporal landslide prediction remains difficult even via in situ monitoring, the presented case study indicates that MTI relying on high resolution radars such as CSK can provide very useful information for slope hazard mapping and possibly for early warning.\nAcknowledgments\nDIF provided contribution to data analysis within the framework of CAR-SLIDE project funded by MIUR (PON01_00536).",

The extensive exposures of the plutonic crust were drilled at 3 sites during ODP Leg 147 (Nov. 1992-Jan. 1993) and IODP Expedition 345 (Dec. 2012-Feb. 2013). We report preliminary results of a bulk rock geochemical study (major and trace elements) carried out on 109 samples representative of the different drilled lithologies.\nThe shallowest gabbroic rocks were sampled at ODP Site 894. They comprise gabbronorite, gabbro, olivine gabbro and gabbronorite. They have evolved compositions with Mg# 39-55, Yb 4-8 x chondrite and Eu/Eu* 1-1.6. Olivine gabbro and troctolite were dominant at IODP Site U1415, with minor gabbro, gabbronorite and clinopyroxene oikocryst-bearing troctolite and gabbro. All U1415 gabbroic rocks have primitive compositions except for one gabbronorite rubble that is similar in composition to the shallow gabbros. Olivine gabbro, gabbro and gabbronorite overlap in composition: they have high Mg# (79-87) and Ni (130-570 ppm), low TiO2 (0.1-0.3 wt.%) and Yb (1.3-2.3 x chondrite) and positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*=1.9-2.7). Troctolite has high Mg# (81-89), Ni (260-1500 ppm) and low TiO2 (<0.1 wt.%) and Yb (~0.5xchondrite) and large Eu/Eu* (>4). ODP Site 895 recovered sequences of highly depleted harzburgite, dunite and troctolite (Yb down to <0.1xchondrite) that are interpreted as a mantle-crust transition zone. Basalts were recovered at Sites 894 and U1415: they have low Yb (0.5-0.9xN6MORB) and are depleted in the most incompatible elements (Ce/Yb=0.6-0.9xN-MORB).\nThe main geochemical characteristics of Site U1415 and 894 gabbroic rocks are consistent with formation as a cumulate sequence from a common parental MORB melt; troctolites are the most primitive end-member of this sequence. They overlap in composition with the most primitive of slow and fast spread crust gabbroic rocks.",

Along the Ecuadorian convergent margin (0°40’N-2°20’S) we interpreted a dense network (one profile every 4 km) of MCS reflection profiles acquired by the Ecuadorian State during the 2009 SCAN cruise with a 8-km-long, 640-channel streamer, and an array of 4000 in3total volume air guns to improve our understanding of the dynamic processes that shape forearc basin stratigraphy and tectonic structures.\nIsopach and structural maps of the acoustic basement show two structural segments on the margin. The northern segment (0°45’S-0°40’N) is characterized by - three sedimentary basins called Pedernales, Bahía-Jama and Caráquez basins, - N30°-50° trending transcurrent faults and -N80°-90° trending normal faults dipping to the south. The southern segment (2°S-0°45’S) is characterized by acoustic basement high, NS-trending until 1°10’S, with small localized sedimentary basins and by N320°-340° trending normal faults dipping to the north. At least five seismic units separated by unconformities are evidenced in the northern basins. Tentative correlations with geological data from the offshore Caraquez-1 well and the on-shore geology, suggest the following Neogene deformation steps: 1) sedimentary basins were initiated along N80°-90° trending normal faults in a regional N30°-50° trending strike slip system during lower Miocene; 2) deformation ended by a regional erosion (underlined by a flat regional unconformity) after the lower Miocene; 3) subsidence began by an undersea regional erosion after the Middle-Upper Miocene (underlined by an irregular regional unconformity), and 4) uplift and locally subsidence of the shelf edge with reactivation of a strike slip fault system from Pliocene (?) to Present. The arrival of the Carnegie ridge and associated seamounts to the trench axis is proposed at the origin of this last stage.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor geodesy has been identified as one of the central tools in marine geosciences to monitor seafloor deformation at high resolution. To quantify strain accumulation and assess the resultant hazard potential we urgently need systems to resolve seafloor crustal deformation.\nThe GeoSEA (Geodetic Earthquake Observatory on the Seafloor) array consists of a seafloor transponder network comprising a total of 35 units and a wave glider acting as a surface unit (GeoSURF) to ensure satellite correspondence, data transfer and monitor system health.\nFor horizontal direct path measurements, the system utilizes acoustic ranging techniques with a ranging precision better than 15 mm and long term stability over 2 km distance. Vertical motion is obtained from pressure gauges. Integrated inclinometers monitor station settlement in two horizontal directions. Travel time between instruments and the local water sound velocity will be recorded autonomously subsea without system or human intervention for up to 3.5 years. Data from the autonomous network on the seafloor can be retrieved via the integrated high-speed acoustic telemetry link without recovering the seafloor units.\nIn late 2015 GeoSEA will be installed on the Iquique segment of the South America – Nazca convergent plate boundary to monitor crustal deformation. The Iquique seismic gap experienced the 2014 Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake, which apparently occurred within a local locking minimum. It is thus crucial to better resolve resolve strain in the forearc between the mainland and the trench in order to improve our understanding of forearc deformation required for hazard assessment. Mobile autonomous seafloor arrays for continuous measurement of active seafloor deformation in hazard zones have the potential to lead to transformative discoveries of plate boundary/fault zone tectonic processes and address a novel element of marine geophysical research.",

            "abstract": "Geosciences have evident repercussions on society. Geoscientists possess knowledge and skills to investigate, manage and intervene on the Geosphere, and this implies ethical obligations. So, the adoption of ethical principles and standards is crucial if geoscientists want to best serve the public. Their ethical responsibility requires a more active role in interacting with society, by giving people valuable contexts that inform the need for sustainable development, and perspectives that reveal essential and delicate balances of natural systems that impact humanity. Geoethics consists of research and reflection on those values upon which to base appropriate behaviour and practices where human activities intersect the Geosphere, and should become an essential point of reference in geoscientists’ curricula. Acting in this direction implies the awareness by the geological community of its ethical commitments and the necessity to train new generations of geoscientists that in the future will be able to transfer to society not only practical aspects of geological knowledge, but also a new way to understand our planet. The IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics (\nwww.iapg.geoethics.org\n) was born to build a new awareness in the scientific community. It aims at joining forces of geoscientists all over the world, through creation of an international, multidisciplinary and scientific platform for discussing ethical problems and dilemmas in Earth Sciences, for strengthening the research base on Geoethics through scientific publications and conferences. Its main goal is to give a new cultural framework of reference, in which to develop effective training tools, in order to sensitize young geoscientists on ethical and social issues related to their future work, starting from the definition of shared values within the scientific community. This work provides an overview on the IAPG goals, activities and ongoing initiatives.",

Due to its high productivity and high water quality, current pumping and overexploitation of the aquifer has significantly lowered the groundwater level over the years. Understanding the recharge regimes of the SAS is critical for the development of sustainable exploitation of water resources in the region and for the establishment of appropriate management practices. In this study, we investigate the hydrologic setting of the SAS and seek to differentiate the degree of paleo versus modern contributions using a range of geochemical approaches. Multiple groundwater samples were collected from deep production wells tapping the SAS at depths between 375−1800 m and across a range of locations. Samples were analyzed for their chemical concentrations, stable isotopic compositions (δ18O and δ2H), and dissolved noble gas concentrations and isotopic ratios. Examining these data identifies unmixed pools of fossil groundwater at deeper depths as well as mixed shallower systems that indicate contributions from modern precipitation. Through isotopic and noble gas analyses, the relative age and timing of these recharge events was examined and show contributions from both glacial and inter-glacial periods, with some modest contributions from modern meteoric sources.",

            "abstract": "This study represents the first simultaneous airborne measurements of BrO, BrCl, Br2 and HOBr in the tropics using a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (CIMS). The results suggest that inorganic halogen chemistry has a more significant impact on O3 depletion and oxidising capacity of the troposphere than previously thought. The CIMS instrument was operated on-board the BAe-146 FAAM research aircraft across 20 flights, as part of the CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics) campaign based on Guam, Micronesia and was supported by measurements of O3 and NOx from core instruments and bromocarbons from Whole Air Samples (WAS). The mean tropospheric BrO concentration over 20 flights was calculated to be 0.69 ppt; a factor of 4 times greater than that predicted by GEOS-Chem running with a tropospheric bromine simulation. An underestimation of HOBr, Br2 and BrCl in the model, when compared to the CIMS data, will contribute to this discrepancy, thus increasing the availability of atomic Br through photolysis, however this does not compensate for the bias currently observed. The magnitude of this discrepancy and subsequent effect on O3 depletion in the tropics is assessed and possible mechanisms are proposed. The measurements of these halogenated species are further used to assess their impact on the HOx budget in the tropics via steady state estimations.",

Conceptual and numerical modelings of STEP predict strike-slip deformation above the deep tear of the slab, which has not been evidenced so far. We present here the first structural evidence of strike-slip deformation offshore Algeria likely associated to a STEP.\nNew deep multichannel seismic lines of the Algerian-French SPIRAL cruise (September 2009, R/V Atalante) and complementary industrial lines from Sonatrach on the westernmost Algerian margin display a narrow and straight asymmetric basin, bounded by two steep conjugate faults parallel to the margin toe. This basin is divided in two main segments following the change in direction of the margin in the Tenes area. The downward offset of the base of the Messinian salt layer in the basin attests of a thick-skin tectonics. The overall geometry of this basin is in favor of a Miocene to Plio-Quaternary crustal strike-slip deformation, with a transtensional component in the eastern segment, and possibly a dextral shear sense. Wide-angle SPIRAL seismic data modeling indicates that the basin is located at the ocean-continent transition (OCT).\nAlthough less clearly expressed in the Khayr-al-Din segment, a comparable basin is also present eastward in the central part of the margin offshore Great Kabylia. Its geometry there is similar to the one observed offshore Tenes, or with a transpressional component at its easternmost end northward of Tigzirt. It is also located at the OCT that is further north in this area.\nWe discuss the interpretation of this more than 400 km-long basin as the surface expression of a STEP offshore Algeria and the implications for the geodynamic evolution of Western Mediterranean.",

            "abstract": "Mechanical compaction and associated porosity reduction play an important role in the diagenesis of porous rocks. They may also affect reservoir rocks during hydrocarbon production, as the pore pressure field is modified. This inelastic compaction can lead to subsidence, cause casing failure, trigger earthquake, or change the fluid transport properties. In addition, inelastic deformation can be time – dependent. In particular, brittle creep phenomena have been deeply investigated since the 90s, especially in sandstones. However knowledge of carbonates behavior is still insufficient.\nIn this study, we focus on the mechanical behavior of a 14.7% porosity white Tavel (France) carbonate rock (>98% calcite). The samples were deformed in a triaxial cell at effective confining pressures ranging from 0 MPa to 85 MPa at room temperature and 70°C. Experiments were carried under dry and water saturated conditions in order to explore the role played by the pore fluids. Two types of experiments have been carried out: (1) a first series in order to investigate the rupture envelopes, and (2) a second series with creep experiments. During the experiments, elastic wave velocities (P and S) were measured to infer crack density evolution. Permeability was also measured during creep experiments.\nOur results show two different mechanical behaviors: (1) brittle behavior is observed at low confining pressures, whereas (2) ductile behavior is observed at higher confining pressures. During creep experiments, these two behaviors have a different signature in term of elastic wave velocities and permeability changes, due to two different mechanisms: development of micro-cracks at low confining pressures and competition between cracks and microplasticity at high confining pressure.\nThe attached figure is a summary of 20 triaxial experiments performed on Tavel limestone under different conditions. Stress states C',C* and C*' and brittle strength are shown in the P-Q space: (a) 20°C and dry, (b) 20°C and water saturated samples, (c) 70°C dry and (d) summary of all the experiments. Three regimes of inelastic and failure modes are observed: brittle failure, shear-enhanced compaction and dilatant cataclastic flow.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of changes in magnetic transition temperatures in magnetite as a geobarometer for extreme conditions like those observed in a meteorite impact on Earth material or in meteorites. We used the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility along with XANES and X-ray diffraction for monitoring magnetic and structural changes. We will demonstrate that the shocked samples show a shift in the Verwey transition temperature (Fig. 1a and b) compared to the unshocked magnetite. Although the Curie temperature itself is very similar for all investigated samples, the shape as well as the amplitude of the heating and cooling curves are nearly reversible for the unshocked “0 GPa” sample but irreversible for the shocked samples. While the amplitude changes before the Curie temperature and above the Verwey transition temperature (Fig. 1a and c) are related to reduction in magnetic domain sizes due to fragmentation, the shift in the Verwey transition temperature and the irreversibility of Curie temperature cannot be explained by this mechanism and we suspect that chemical (Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio in Fe3O4) or structural (lattice distortion) changes occur. These findings help to constrain data for a possible strain memory of magnetic transition temperatures in magnetite and help to explore the potential use of changes in magnetic transition temperatures as a strain memory as earlier suggested by Carporzen and Gilder (2010).\nCarporzen, L., Gilder, S.A., 2010: Strain memory of the Verwey transition, J.

            "abstract": "We challenge the generally accepted view that continent-continent collision results in doubly verging orogenic wedges with well-developed retro-wedges on the overriding plate. In fact we argue that retro-wedge formation is restricted to specific rheological conditions within the lower and upper plates as well as the plate contact; thus being the exception rather than the rule during collision.\nIn this contribution we use a combination of physical analog and numerical experiments to infer favourable rheological conditions for the development of retro-wedges. In both analog and numerical experiments the contact between the colliding and neutrally buoyant continents is weak and represents the inheritance of a former subduction boundary. The degree of plate coupling however is not constant and is together with the rheological structures of the lower and upper plates, in particular the presence of decoupling horizons, key variable in this study. Plate boundaries are in all experiments orthogonal to the convergence direction.\nAnalog and numerical models with strong decoupling at the plate boundary and different levels (at the Moho or the brittle-ductile transition) of the incoming plate lead to the evolution of mountain belts, where deformation propagates outward, in the direction of the incoming plate, by successive imbrication of upper crustal thrust sheets. Under these conditions, which are typical for subduction-dominated orogens like the Carpathians, the Dinarides or the Apennines, no significant retro-wedges with large-displacement retro-shears develop.\nTransfer of strain to the upper plate, a pre-requisite for the formation of retro-wedges, is favoured when the degree of plate coupling is high, the crust of the colliding plates is very strong and when the upper plate contains decoupling horizons (e.g. at the Moho or the brittle-ductile transition). Under such conditions large-scale retro-shears develop and deformation propagates outward on the upper plate to form a retro-wedge.\nThese experimental results provide insight in past rheological conditions of doubly verging mountain belts, like some parts of the Alps demonstrating that retro-wedge formation is only possible under restricted rheological conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission monitors sea surface salinity over the global ocean for more than 4.5 years.\nThe objective of this presentation is 1) to analyse the signature of rainfall on SMOS salinity and 2) to validate it. This is a challenging task given that SMOS measures the salinity in the first top centimeter (S1cm) while most in situ measurements of salinity (SSS) are made at a few meters depth and that other effects than sea surface salinity may affect the radiometric signal, like sea surface roughness modified by rain drops and rain atmospheric effects.\nWe investigate the signature of rainfall on SMOS S1cm using various methods. First, we compare SMOS S1cm with ARGO SSS measured at about 5m depth in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in the Southern Pacific Convergence Zone. Second, we study the correlation between spatial variability of SMOS S1cm and spatial variability of rainfall. In both cases, we estimate that S1cm decrease associated with rainfall occurring within less than 1hour from salinity measurement is close to -0.2 pss (mm hr-1)-1. Given the multiangular retrieval of SMOS radiometric polarized measurements and given existing atmospheric models, we estimate that rain induced roughness and atmospheric effects are responsible for no more than 20% of this value. We then study the signature of rainfall on sea surface salinity measured by surface drifters at 45cm depth. 22 rain events, as detected by satellite rain measurements, have been sampled by surface drifters. We observe a decrease of the drifters salinity associated with rainfall of ‑0.21 (+/-0.14) pss (mm hr-1)-1, consistent with SMOS observations.\nWhen averaged over one month, the rain associated salinity instantaneous decrease is at most -0.2 in monthly 100x100km2 pixels, and at most 40% of the difference between SMOS S1cm and interpolated in situ SSS in pixels near the ITCZ. This suggests that more than half of this difference could be related to other effects like the in-situ products obtained from optimal interpolation and therefore influenced by smoothing and relaxation to climatology, radio frequency interferences or rain history. The relative importance of each of these effects will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since the Pliocene, global climate history is distinguished by the transition into a colder world, dominated by the onset and intensification of major Northern Hemisphere glaciations which have also changed in their duration and intensity. Potential drivers for these events include falling atmospheric CO2, progressive sub-glacial erosion, tectonic uplift, and associated feedbacks. At present, isolating climate as the driver of evolving continental ice volume since the Pliocene is hindered by the limited long term data sets which directly link climate changes to evidence for ice-sheet advance/retreat, erosion, and tectonic evolution over million year timescales.\nIODP Expedition 341 drilled a cross-margin transect in the Gulf of Alaska from ice-proximal sites on the continental shelf to distal sites in the deep Pacific. This study focuses on the distal site (Site U1417, c.4190 m water depth) which contains variable biogenic and terrigenous contributions, and evidence for deposition through pelagic, mass movement and glacial processes. Our aim is to investigate links between north-east Pacific paleoceanography and the history of the north-west Cordilleran ice sheet, neither of which are fully understood given limited data pre-dating the Last Glacial Maximum.\nWe reconstruct SSTs during the mid-Pliocene, Plio-Pleistocene Transition (PPT) and mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) using the UK37’ index. We consider the interaction between SSTs and primary production by examining the absolute and relative abundances of plankton biomarkers (e.g. for haptophytes, diatoms and dinoflagellates), carbon/nitrogen ratios, stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) and diatom assemblages. Links between these climatic events and the north-west Cordilleran ice-sheet advance/retreat history are initially made using shipboard stratigraphy; emerging data sets on ice-rafting from members of the Expedition 341 Scientific Party will refine these relationships.",

            "abstract": "In a changing climate, future inundation of the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts will depend on the combined effect of storm surges during tropical cyclones and the rising sea levels on which those surges occur. The observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin is too short (AD 1851-present) to allow for accurate assessment of long-term trends in storm activity. In order to overcome the limitations of the short observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, we downscaled four CMIP5 models to generate synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the Atlantic basin that span from AD 850 to AD 2005. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines these tropical cyclone simulations with storm surge models and local proxy sea-level reconstructions of the last two millennia, we provide insight into the connections between climate change, sea-level rise, tropical cyclones, and coastal flooding events like Hurricane Sandy of 2012. We present a comparison of pre-anthropogenic era (before AD 1800) and anthropogenic era (since AD 1800) storm surge model results from the New York/New Jersey region, exposing links between increased rates of sea-level rise and storm surge heights. An analysis of the characteristics and metrics of the tropical cyclones that create storm surges in this region is also performed. Results of this work will be a step towards improved scientific prediction of coastal inundation as a result of sea-level rise and tropical cyclones in our changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Detection of hydrocarbon shows in marine areas is of primary importance for oil and gas exploration since they confirm hydrocarbon generation and prove the presence of an active petroleum system. The use of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images serves as an ideal technology for the imaging of hydrocarbon seeps as it is cost effective, provides large ground coverage with continuous acquisitions and operates day and night and in all weather conditions. Here, we present results on the interpretation of radar images for seepage detection on the West African margin. Long-term monitoring of 150 SAR scenes during 20 years allowed the recognition of more than 1400 oil seepages.\nSeabed morphologies associated to oil leakage correspond to clusters of small sized pockmarks, 50 to 200 m in diameter, and high-reflectivity mounds. The correlation between the location of the impact point of the oil plume at the sea surface with the seabed features reveals that oceanic drift of the oil is less than 1000 m through a water column of 1800 m, with a rising speed of 10 cm/s.\nIn order to address the question of the seeps lifetime, we set up a short-term monitoring through the acquisition of one radar scene every 12 hours during 10 days in a specific area recognized for active oil leaking. Our main observations are: (i) the number of detected seeps varies spatially and temporally, and (ii) oil seep dissipation is effective in less than 12 hours. The variation of the hydrostatic pressure in the water column associated to the oscillation of the tide has been firstly considered as a possible mechanism controlling the expulsion of oil at the seafloor in relation with the number of seeps detected on each image. However, the correlation between the regional mean wind field and the amount of oil seeps strongly suggests that the wind is a primary factor to be considered for seepage detection. In addition, the age of the seepage on the sea surface is undetermined when the SAR imagery is solely used. As a result, it was not possible to confirm or invalidate the tidal hypothesis with the data collected. Future work towards the assimilation of SAR-based oil contour in a drift model is outlined. It will allow the retrieval of the age of the seepage and hence enable the proper assessment of the tidal hypothesis.",

Four short cores raised from the Alpha Ridge in the 1970s and 1980s from drift stations T-3 and CESAR showed ages between 45 and 76 my. The reason for these old ages became clear when examination of legacy seismic data from T-3 showed that in some places up to 500 m of sediments had been removed within an area of some 200 by 600 km, presumably by an impact of asteroid fragments.\nTo investigate the impact area, the authors conceived an innovative research platform in 2007. Named the R/H SABVABAA, this 12m by 6m hovercraft has been home-based in Svalbard since June 2008. During the following 6 years the craft and its evolving innovative light-weight equipment have made 18 trips to the summer ice pack, traveling some 4410 km over ice during some six months of scientific investigations.\nAn opportunity to get a lift to this area, some 1500 km from Svalbard, came in a 2011 invitation to join AWI's icebreaker POLARSTERN in its ARK-XXVIII/4 expedition departing Tromsö August 5, 2014. The 400 day drift will be the first wintering over, ever, of a mobile research platform with geophysical, geological, and oceanographic capabilities.\nThe Arctic ice pack continually moves due to winds and currents. While at the main camp, observations will consist of marine geophysics (seismic profiling with four element CHIRP, a 20 in³ airgun with single hydrophone, as well as 12 kHz bathymetry and 200 kHz sounding of the deep scattering layer), marine geology (coring with a hydrostatically-boosted 3 or 6 m corer; bottom photography; and two rock dredges), and oceanography. Deployed away from the camp, four sonobuoys will allow 3-D seismic acquisition. Access to the depths below the ice is via a hydraulic capstan winch, with 6500 m of Kevlar aramid fiber rope with 2.8 ton breaking strength. Ice thickness monitoring of the local 100 km² will be made with the craft's EM-31 probe when away from the camp, moving to choice locations for taking cores, and deformation of the ice pack monitored by 5 remote GPS data loggers. A meteorological station including radiation flux measurements will be operated. Several cameras will be used to observe under-ice conditions (ice formation, biology) as well as time-lapse local ice movement.\nThe talk will summarize the operations up to the time of the GEBCO 2014 Science Day at the AGU Fall Meeting.",

            "abstract": "This work is dedicated to the study of the lightning-related plumes in terms of origin, quantification of the plumes trace gas, and impact on the budget of ozone in particular in the upper troposphere (critical region regarding the greenhouse effect). Recently, Gressent et al., 2014, demonstrated that the majority (74%) of large scale plumes (>300km) from lightning emissions (LNOx) is related to warm conveyor belts and extra-tropical cyclones originating from North America and entering the intercontinental pathway between North America and Europe, leading to a negative (positive) west to east NOy (O3) zonal gradient with -0.4 (+18) ppb difference during spring and -0.6 (+14) ppb difference in summer. In order to better constraint lightning emissions impact in global models, a plume parameterization has been implemented in the 3D chemistry and transport GEOS-Chem global model (Harvard University). Such parameterization was successfully developed for aircraft exhausts application (Cariolle et al., 2009). It allows reproducing sub-grid processes related to lightning NOx chemistry and the chemical evolution during transport in the atmosphere. The issue is here based on the evaluation of parameters such as the plume lifetime and the effective reaction rate constant within the plume. The Dynamically Simple Model of Atmospheric Chemical Complexity (DSMACC) is used to determine such critical values and to better understand the chemical interactions between NOx and O3 species within the undiluted fraction of the plume. Additionally high-resolved simulations of the French meso-scale Meso-NH model are applied over specific case studies of thunderstorms in order to consider the dynamical conditions necessary to represent the plume dilution to the background atmosphere. Finally, sensitivity tests are carried out with the GEOS-Chem model to evaluate the impact of this plume-in-grid model on the ozone and nitrogen species budget.",

            "abstract": "The quantification of shape parameters in pyroclasts is fundamental to infer the dominant type of magma fragmentation (magmatic vs. phreatomagmatic), as well as the behavior of volcanic plumes and clouds in the atmosphere.\nIn a case study aiming at reconstructing the fragmentation mechanisms triggering maar eruptions in two geologically and compositionally distinctive volcanic fields (West and East Eifel, Germany), the shapes of a large number of ash particle contours obtained from SEM images were analyzed by a dilation-based fractal method. Volcanic particle contours are pseudo-fractals showing mostly two distinct slopes in Richardson plots related to the fractal dimensions D1 (small-scale “textural” dimension) and D2 (large-scale “morphological” dimension). The validity of the data obtained from 2D sections was tested by analysing SEM micro-CT slices of one particle cut in different orientations and positions. Results for West Eifel maar particles yield large D1 values (> 1.023), resembling typical values of magmatic particles, which are characterized by a complex shape, especially at small scales. In contrast, the D1 values of ash particles from one East Eifel maar deposit are much smaller, coinciding with the fractal dimensions obtained from phreatomagmatic end-member particles. These quantitative morphological analyses suggest that the studied maar eruptions were triggered by two different fragmentation processes: phreatomagmatic in the East Eifel and magmatic in the West Eifel. The application of fractal analysis to quantitatively characterize the shape of pyroclasts and the linking of fractal dimensions to specific fragmentation processes has turned out to be a very promising tool for studying the fragmentation history of any volcanic eruption.\nThe next step is to extend morphological analysis of volcanic particles to 3 dimensions. SEM micro-CT, already applied in this study, offers the required resolution, but is not suitable for the analysis of a large number of particles. Newly released nano CT-scanners, however, allows the simultaneous analysis of a statistically relevant number of particles (in the hundreds range). Preliminary results of a first trial will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Pattern scaling methods have been used since the 1990s to estimate the results of global climate models (GCMs), in particular for emissions scenarios for which GCM simulations are not available. The basic method uses global mean surface temperature as the scaling variable, and relies on the assumption of a constant spatial pattern of change per unit global warming. This presentation will briefly review the status of pattern scaling science, using results from the published literature, and from a recent workshop held at NCAR. Successes and challenges will be illustrated of the use of pattern scaling to provide information on future changes for use by the impacts and integrated assessment modelling communities. This activity reflects anticipation of an enhanced role for emulation methods in a new process underway to produce integrated scenarios of future climate and societal change, which extends the number of scenarios of interest beyond the small set of RCPs used in GCM simulations for CMIP5.\nRelevant challenges include effects of non-linearities caused by: different responses to different levels of greenhouse gas forcing; different timescales of regional response for alternative forcing pathways leading to the same global temperature response; combining the effects of multiple individual forcing agents. Understanding and projecting the responses to forcing agents such as aerosols and land use is likely to be particularly important in emulating changes during the next few decades. Further challenges include how to represent uncertainties and multivariate changes robustly in order to provide a basis for realistic assessments of impacts and risks, and extensions to the basic pattern scaling paradigm. Such extensions include consideration of scaling variables other than global mean temperature, and the recent development of new approaches to emulation using alternative statistical techniques and different physical assumptions.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent improvements in networks and data, the global aleatory uncertainty (sigma) in GMPEs is still large. One reason is the ergodic approach, where we combine data in space to make up for lack of data in time. By estimating the systematic site response, we can make site-specific GMPEs and use a lower, site-specific uncertainty: single-station sigma.\nIn this study we use the EUROSEISTEST database (http://euroseisdb.civil.auth.gr), which has two distinct advantages: good existing knowledge of site conditions at all stations, and careful relocation of the recorded events. Constraining the site and source parameters as best we can, we minimise the within- and between-events components of the global, ergodic sigma.\nFollowing that, knowledge of the site response from empirical and theoretical approaches permits us to move on to single-station sigma. The variability per site is not clearly correlated to the site class. We show that in some cases knowledge of Vs30 is not sufficient, and that site-specific data are needed to capture the response, possibly due to 2D/3D effects from complex geometry.\nOur values of single-station sigma are low compared to the literature. This may be due to the good ray coverage we have in all directions for small, nearby records. Indeed, our single-station sigma values are similar to published single-path values, which means that they may correspond to a fully -rather than partially- non-ergodic approach. We find larger ground motion variability for short distances and small magnitudes. This may be related to the uncertainty in the depth affecting nearby records more, or to stress drop and causing trade-offs between the source and site terms for small magnitudes.",

            "abstract": "Water systems planners have long recognized the need for robust solutions capable of withstanding deviations from the conditions for which they were designed. Faced with a set of alternatives to choose from—for example, resulting from a multi-objective optimization—existing analysis frameworks offer competing definitions of robustness under change. Robustness analyses have moved from expected utility to exploratory “bottom-up” approaches in which vulnerable scenarios are identified prior to assigning likelihoods; examples include Robust Decision Making (RDM), Decision Scaling, Info-Gap, and Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). We propose a taxonomy of robustness frameworks to compare and contrast these approaches, based on their methods of (1) alternative selection, (2) sampling of states of the world, (3) quantification of robustness measures, and (4) identification of key uncertainties using sensitivity analysis. Using model simulations from recent work in multi-objective urban water supply portfolio planning, we illustrate the decision-relevant consequences that emerge from each of these choices. Results indicate that the methodological choices in the taxonomy lead to substantially different planning alternatives, underscoring the importance of an informed definition of robustness. We conclude with a set of recommendations for problem framing: that alternatives should be searched rather than prespecified; dominant uncertainties should be discovered rather than assumed; and that a multivariate satisficing measure of robustness allows stakeholders to achieve their problem-specific performance requirements. This work highlights the importance of careful problem formulation, and provides a common vocabulary to link the robustness frameworks widely used in the field of water systems planning.",

            "abstract": "Microwave links from cellular communication networks have been shown to be able to provide valuable information concerning the space-time variability of rainfall. In particular over urban areas, where network densities are generally high, they have the potential to complement existing dedicated infrastructure to measure rainfall (gauges, radars). In addition, microwave links provide a great opportunity for ground-based rainfall measurement for those land surface areas of the world where gauges and radars are generally lacking, e.g. Africa, Latin America, and large parts of Asia. Such information is not only crucial for water management and agriculture, but also for instance for ground validation of space-borne rainfall estimates such as those provided by the recently launched core satellite of the GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) mission.\nWURex14 is dedicated to address several errors and uncertainties associated with such quantitative precipitation estimates in detail. The core of the experiment is provided by two co-located microwave links installed between two major buildings on the Wageningen University campus, approximately 2 km apart: a 38 GHz commercial microwave link, kindly provided to us by T-Mobile NL, and a 38 GHz dual-polarization research microwave link from RAL. Transmitting and receiving antennas have been attached to masts installed on the roofs of the two buildings, about 30 m above the ground. This setup has been complemented with a Scintec infrared Large-Aperture Scintillometer, installed over the same path, as well as a Parsivel optical disdrometer, located close to the mast on the receiving end of the links. During the course of the experiment, a 26 GHz RAL research microwave link was added to the experimental setup. Temporal sampling of the received signals was performed at a rate of 20 Hz. In addition, two time-lapse cameras have been installed on either side of the path to monitor the wetness of the antennas as well as the state of the atmosphere. Approximately halfway along the link path a rain gauge from the KNMI operational network is located. Finally, data is available from several commercial microwave links in the vicinity of the experimental setup, as well as from the KNMI weather radars.\nWe report on the first results from this experiment, collected during the Summer and Fall of 2014.",

            "abstract": "We present spatially resolved EUV spectroscopic measurements of\npervasive, faint Fe XIX 592.2 A line emission in an active region\nobserved during the 2013 April 23 flight of the Extreme Ultraviolet\nNormal Incidence Spectrograph (EUNIS-13) sounding rocket instrument.\nWith cooled detectors, high sensitivity, and high spectral\nresolution, EUNIS-13 resolves the lines of Fe XIX at 592.2 A (formed\nat temperature T around 8.9 MK) and Fe XII at 592.6 A (T around 1.6\nMK). The Fe XIX line emission, observed over an area in excess of\n4920 square arcsec (2.58x10^9 square km, more than 60% of the active\nregion), provides strong evidence for the nanoflare heating model of\nthe solar corona. No GOES events occurred in the region less than 2\nhours before the rocket flight, but a microflare was observed north\nand east of the region with RHESSI and EUNIS during the flight. The\nabsence of significant upward velocities anywhere in the region,\nparticularly the microflare, indicates that the pervasive Fe XIX\nemission is not propelled outward from the microflare site, but is\nmost likely attributed to localized heating (due to reconnection,\nwave dissipation, or some other mechanism) consistent with the\nnanoflare heating model of the solar corona. We measure average Fe\nXIX/Fe XII intensity ratios of 0.070 outside the AR core, 0.22 in\narea of bright coronal emission (the area in which the Fe XII\nintensity exceeds half its maximum observed value), and 0.55 in the\nregion's hot core. Using the CHIANTI atomic physics database and\nassuming ionization equilibrium, we estimate corresponding Fe XIX/Fe\nXII emission measure ratios of about 0.076, 0.23 and 0.59. The\nemission measure ratios must be viewed with caution in light of\nlingering uncertainties in the Fe XII contribution functions.\nEUNIS-13 was supported by the NASA Heliophysics Division through its\nLow Cost Access to Space program.",

The framework will include ion and electron kinetic species in the ionosphere, plasmasphere and polar wind, and kinetic ion, super-thermal electron and fluid electron species in the magnetosphere. The framework is ideally suited to modeling ion outflow from the ionosphere and plasmasphere, where a wide range for fluid and kinetic processes are important. These include escaping ion interactions with (1) photoelectrons, (2) cusp/auroral waves, double layers, and field-aligned currents, (3) double layers in the polar cap due to the interaction of cold ionospheric and hot magnetospheric electrons, (4) counter-streaming ions, and (5) electromagnetic wave turbulence. The kinetic ion interactions are particularly strong during geomagnetic storms and substorms. The presentation will provide a brief description of the models involved and discuss the effect that kinetic processes have on the ion outflow.",

            "abstract": "The eﬀect of clouds on large scale dynamics is represented in climate models through parameterization of various processes, of which the parameterization of shallow and deep convection are particularly uncertain. The atmospheric boundary layer, which controls the coupling to the surface, and which deﬁnes the scale of shallow convection, is typically 1 km in depth. Thus, simulations on a O(100 m) grid largely obviate the need for such parameterizations. By crossing this threshold of O(100m) grid resolution one can begin thinking of large-eddy simulation (LES), wherein the sub-grid scale parameterization have a sounder theoretical foundation. Substantial initiatives have been taken internationally to approach this threshold. For example, Miura et al., 2007 and Mirakawa et al., 2014 approach this threshold by doing global simulations, with (gradually) decreasing grid resolution, to understand the eﬀect of cloud-resolving scales on the general circulation. Our strategy, on the other hand, is to take a big leap forward by ﬁxing the resolution at O(100 m), and gradually increasing the domain size. We believe that breaking this threshold would greatly help in improving the parameterization schemes and reducing the uncertainty in climate predictions.\nTo take this forward, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research has initiated a project on HD(CP)2 that aims for a limited area LES at resolution O(100 m) using the new unified modeling system ICON (Zängl et al., 2014). In the talk, results from the HD(CP)2 evaluation simulation will be shown that targets high resolution simulation over a small domain around Jülich, Germany. This site is chosen because high resolution HD(CP)2 Observational Prototype Experiment took place in this region from 1.04.2013 to 31.05.2013, in order to critically evaluate the model. Nesting capabilities of ICON is used to gradually increase the resolution from the outermost domain, which is forced from the COSMO-DE data, to the innermost and ﬁnest resolution domain centered around Jülich (see Fig. 1 top panel). Furthermore, detailed analyses of the simulation results against the observation data will be presented. A reprsentative figure showing time series of column integrated water vapor (IWV) for both model and observation on 24.04.2013 is shown in bottom panel of Fig. 1.",

            "abstract": "During mid-September 2013, approximately 360 mm of precipitation fell in the headwaters of the North St. Vrain drainage basin, Front Range, CO. Debris flows on steep hillslopes and extensive flooding along North St. Vrain Creek resulted in extreme sedimentation within Ralph Price Reservoir, municipal water supply for the City of Longmont. The event allows comparison of historical sedimentation with that of an unusually large flood because 1) no reservoir flushing has been conducted since dam construction, 2) reservoir stratigraphy chronicles uninterrupted delta deposition, and 3) this is the only on-channel reservoir with unimpeded, natural sediment flux from the Continental Divide to the mountain front in a basin with no significant historic flow modifications and land use impacts. Assessing the flood-related sedimentation prior to any dredging activities included coring the reservoir delta, a bathymetric survey of the delta, resistivity and ground penetrating radar surveys of the subaerial inlet deposit, and surveying tributary deposits. Over the 44-year life of the reservoir, two-thirds of the delta sedimentation is attributed to extreme discharges from the September 2013 storm. Total storm-derived reservoir sedimentation is approximately 275,000 m3, with 81% of that within the gravel-dominated inlet and 17% in the delta. Volumes of deposition within reservoir tributary inlets is negatively correlated with contributing area, possibly due to a lack of storage in these small basins (1-5 km2). Flood-related reservoir sedimentation will be compared to other research quantifying volumes from slope failures evident on post-storm lidar. Analysis of delta core samples will quantify organic carbon flux associated with the extreme discharge and develop a chronology of flood and fire disturbances for North St. Vrain basin. Applications of similar techniques are planned for two older Front Range reservoirs affected by the September flooding to fill knowledge gaps about event-based sedimentation and to expand these rates to annual and decadal scales.",

            "abstract": "Cumberland Gap Tunnel was constructed in 1996 to improve highway travel between southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee and to restore Cumberland Gap to its historical appearance. About five years after construction, the concrete pavement in the tunnel began to exhibit noticeable signs of subsidence. Ground penetrating radar surveys detected voids in many areas of the limestone roadbed aggregate beneath the pavement. Field investigations conducted by the Kentucky Geological Survey and Kentucky Transportation Center from 2006 to 2008 discovered that groundwater was flowing from the bedrock invert into the aggregate along many parts of the tunnel. Average groundwater discharge from the tunnel was measured at approximately 1700 m3/d. We analyzed 265 groundwater samples collected from aggregate in different parts of the tunnel roadbed during low and high flow conditions. Calculated calcite saturation indices indicated that the groundwater was geochemically aggressive and capable of continuously dissolving calcite in the limestone aggregate although pH values of these water samples were near neutral. We also conducted an in-situ dissolution experiment by placing eight baskets filled with limestone aggregate beneath the roadbed in different locations in the tunnel for 178 days. At the end of the experiment, the limestone aggregate in contact with groundwater exhibited visual signs of dissolution and lost mass, and the highest mass loss recorded was 3.4 percent. Mass loss calculations based on kinetic models of calcite mineral and water samples taken near the baskets matched well with the actual measured mass losses, confirming that dissolution of calcite by the groundwater was the primary cause of the roadbed subsidence problem. Based on these findings, we suggested the limestone aggregate be replaced with noncarbonate (granite) aggregate to mitigate future road subsidence. The suggestion was adopted, and the repair was completed in early 2014.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is one of the limiting nutrients in coastal environments, especially in river- dominated deltaic regions with large amount of inorganic nitrogen inputs from the river. The principal source of P to coastal waters is suspended particulate matter from river discharge, a large portion of which is deposited on the continental shelves. The bottom sediments thus can be an important source of P to the overlying water column depending on the concentrations and chemical forms of P. This study provides a quantitative determination of the abundance and chemical speciation of P from the shelf, slope and deep sea sediments of coastal Louisiana. A sequential extraction method (SEDEX) was used to operationally separate the P pools into readily available P, Fe/Al-bound P, alkali extractable organic P, Ca/Mg-bound P, and residual/refractory P phases. Samples were analyzed for total metals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Al) and total organic carbon to quantify their association with different forms of P. In general, TP was well correlated to the concentrations of Mg (p<0.05). The concentrations of available P, alkali extractable organic P, and refractory P higher in deep sea sediments, while the shelves sediments had higher concentrations of Fe/Al-bound P. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranged between 425 to 1883 mg/kg. Available P was the smallest pool (<1% of TP), while Ca/Mg-bound P was the most abundant (~80% of TP) pool. Phosphorous sedimentary fractions can provide us with the insights into burial, digenesis and residence time of P in the coastal sediments in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The flux of P from bottom sediments provides an additional source of P to the nitrogen-rich water column that can stimulate algal growth, ultimately contributing to hypoxia in coastal Louisiana.",

The Data Curation Profile Toolkit was utilized to work with the scientist in order to determine his needs with respect to curation of the data set. Through a number of formal interviews, it was established that the scientist required assistance in documenting the data workflow, updating the metadata, and eventually archiving the data with an appropriate repository. The data curator worked with the scientist to document the data workflow both as a visual diagram and in a README file for the scientist’s future reference. The existing metadata content was verified for accuracy against original data set documentation and additional metadata was added to include provenance and detailed data descriptions. The authors determined that the most appropriate repository for the data was the Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC).

            "abstract": "Coal-tar-based (CT) sealcoat is used to protect and beautify the asphalt pavement of driveways and parking lots primarily in the central, southern, and northeastern U.S. and in Canada. CT sealcoat typically is 20 to 35 percent crude coal tar or coal-tar pitch and contains from 50,000 to 100,000 mg/kg PAHs, about 1,000 times more than asphalt-based (AS) sealcoat or asphalt itself. Tires and snowplows abrade the friable sealcoat surface into fine particles—PAH concentrations in fine particles (dust) from CT-sealcoated pavement are about 1,000 times higher than in dust from AS-sealcoated pavement (median total PAH concentrations 2,200 and 2.1 mg/kg, respectively). Use of CT sealcoat has several implications for urban streams and lakes. Source apportionment modeling has indicated that, in regions where CT sealcoat is prevalent, particles from sealcoated pavement are contributing the majority of the PAHs to recently deposited lake sediment, with implications for ecological health. Acute 2-d toxicity of runoff from CT-sealcoated pavement to stream biota, demonstrated for a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), continues for samples collected as long as weeks or months following sealcoat application. Using the fish-liver cell line RGL-W1, runoff collected as much as 36 days following CT-sealcoat application has been demonstrated to cause DNA damage and impair DNA repair capacity. These results demonstrate that CT runoff is a potential hazard to aquatic ecosystems for at least several weeks after sealant application, and that exposure to sunlight can enhance toxicity and genetic damage. Recent research has provided direct evidence that restricting use of CT sealcoat in a watershed can lead to a substantial reduction in PAH concentrations in receiving water bodies.",

            "abstract": "Some landslides move slowly or intermittently downslope, whereas others accelerate catastrophically and run out long distances across flat or gently sloping terrain. Seldom does landsliding of one type transition abruptly into the other, however, and seldom are the consequences more severe than at a site near Oso, Washington, where more than 40 fatalities resulted from a high-speed, long-runout landslide on 22 March 2014. Our interpretations of seismic data inversions and eyewitness accounts indicate that the Oso event began gradually, with remobilization of old landslide deposits that were unusually wet due to months of exceptional precipitation. For about 50 s, relatively slow downslope motion of these deposits withdrew support from a bluff above them, and then the bluff collapsed abruptly. This collapse radiated strong broadband seismic energy and rapidly loaded the old landslide material downslope. We infer that this rapid loading of previously dilated landslide debris caused contractive deformation, widespread liquefaction, and runaway acceleration. The resulting debris avalanche flow (DAF) had a volume of 8 ×106 m3and a fahrböschung (H/L ratio) of 0.106, making it exceptionally mobile for a landslide of its size. The leading edge of the Oso DAF may have gained mobility by entraining water as it displaced the adjacent Stillaguamish River and by liquefying wet floodplain sediments as it overran them, and it formed distal deposits that resembled those of many wood-freighted debris flows. The transition from relatively slow landslide motion (which had occurred intermittently for decades at the Oso site) to high-speed motion and long runout appears to have been very sensitive to contingencies. Our simulations of the Oso event using a new numerical model (D-Claw) show that small differences in water-saturated porosity (n) were sufficient to cause divergent landslide behaviors. In a case with n = 0.38, D-Claw predicts runaway liquefaction and high-speed runout much like that observed at Oso, and in a case with n = 0.36, it predicts much slower landsliding that ceases after only about 100 m of motion. This behavioral bifurcation has fundamental physical importance as well as large ramifications for assessment of landslide hazards.",

            "abstract": "Flooding over the central United States is responsible for large societal and economic impacts, quantifiable in tens of fatalities and billions of dollars in damage. Because of these large repercussions, it is of paramount importance to examine whether the magnitude and/or frequency of flood events have been changing over the most recent decades.\nHere we address this research question using annual and seasonal maximum daily streamflow records from 774 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stations over the central United States (the study area includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan). The focus is on “long” records (i.e., at least 50 years of data) ending no earlier than 2011. Analyses are performed using block-maximum and peak-over-threshold approaches.\nWe find limited evidence suggesting increasing or decreasing trends in the magnitude of flood peaks over this area. On the other hand, there is much stronger evidence of increasing frequency of flood events. Therefore, our results support the notion that it is not so much that the largest flood peaks are getting larger, but rather that we have been experiencing a larger number of flood events every year. By examining the rainfall records, we are able to link these increasing trends to similar patterns in heavy rainfall over the region.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 300 years, each of the three surge-type outlet glaciers of the Drangajökull ice cap in north-west Iceland has surged 2-4 times. There is valuable historical information available on the surge frequencies since the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum because of the proximity of the surging outlets, Reykjarfjarðarjökull, Leirufjarðarjökull and Kaldalónsjökull to farms and pastures. We have reconstructed the surge history of the Drangajökull ice cap, based on geomorphological mapping, sedimentary studies and review of historical records. Geomorphological mapping of the glacier forefields revealed twice as many end-moraines than previously recognized. This indicates a higher surge frequency than previously perceived. A clear relationship between the surge frequency and climate cannot be established, however, surges were more frequent during the 19th century and the earliest 20th century compared to the cool 18th century and the warmer late part of the 20th century.\nWe have estimated the magnitude of the LIA maximum surge events by reconstruction of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) that can be compared with modern DEMs. As reference points for the digital elevation modelling we used the recently mapped lateral moraines and historical information on the exposure timing of nunataks. During the LIA maximum surge events the outlet glaciers extended 3-3.5 km further down-valley than at present. Their ice volumes were at least 2-2.5 km3 greater than after their most recent surges in the beginning of the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Chromium, a naturally occurring contaminant, poses a significant threat to California groundwater quality when ultramafic rocks weather leaving Cr-enriched serpentine soils. Benign and of limited solubility, Cr(III) can oxidize into soluble and carcinogenic Cr(VI). Under most environmental conditions, Mn-oxides are the principal oxidant of Cr(III). Here we investigate Cr(III) oxidation by both abiotically synthesized birnessite and biogenically produced Mn-oxides. Further, we explore chromium dynamics within artificial soil aggregates composed of Cr(OH)3- and Cr0.25Fe0.75(OH)3-coated quartz grains surrounded by aerated solute flow. Abiotic aggregates contained synthetic birnessite, while biotic aggregates were inoculated with Leptothrix cholodnii, a manganese-oxidizing bacterium, and Shewanella putrefaciens, an iron-reducing bacterium. Results show aqueous Cr(VI) concentrations scaling with Cr-mineral solubility. When Leptothrix sp.-inoculated Cr(III),Fe(III)-aggregates are supplied with aqueous Mn(II), Mn-oxides precipitate in the aerobic aggregate. Cr(VI) production occurs similar to that via synthetic birnessite. With the addition of Shewanella sp., coupled biotic and abiotic processes occur causing the reduction, and subsequent immobilization, of chromium by microbial metabolites (e.g., Fe(II)). This study shows the importance of microbial community composition on chromium dynamics within diffusion-limited zones, and suggests the potential for biological immobilization of Cr even in the presence of Mn-oxidizing bacteria.",

One of the main features is its Live Access Server (LAS). The LAS is an open source tool that allows users to customize data sets to suit their individual needs, choosing from among 250 global Level III data sets. The MY NASA DATA project hosts over 120 lesson plans and activities that utilize this library of Earth system science data as collected by NASA satellites. This collection of data parameters are offered to help teachers easily add data exploration to their current curriculum, and give them an easy to use tool to keep coming back for all of their data needs. Through the built in inquiry of the lesson plans and the easy to navigate layout of the LAS, educators have numerous ways connect their students to the data, giving their students a unique hands on experience with authentic NASA data.\nWith a shift in many states science standards, classroom teachers are rethinking how science can be taught in the classroom. Through the use of data exercises in the classroom, teachers now have the ability to introduce their students to the many possibilities of data. By using authentic data, students can immerse themselves in place based learning exercises and be driven by inquiry to answer all of their questions through immersion in the data. The MY NASA DATA lesson plans, activities, and the data itself, give formal and informal audiences a place to go for science understanding and the answers to many questions in the science classroom. By utilizing authentic data sets and materials on MY NASA DATA that are prepared specificaly for all areas of education, users will be more readily prepared to answer their own questions about the world around them meet the needs of classroom assessment.",

Large-scale perturbations over the pole may formally be represented only with zonal wavenumbers 0 or 1. Only the latter may support winds and the only migrating tide that can exist over the pole is the diurnal westward DW1. Other tidal periods projecting on the permitted wavenumbers inevitably correspond to nonmigrating waves such as the well documented semidiurnal westward SW1. Migrating tides make a noticeable contribution over the edges of the continent posing an identification problem for stations on the ground. Free-running WAM simulations show good agreement in amplitude, phase, seasonal and day-to-day variability of prominent tides with observations by some ground-based instruments but less so with others. Because the model dynamics is self-consistent, this implies that estimates of tidal variations of different parameters, e.g., temperature and winds, or from different instruments cannot be all correct. More cross-validation and detailed analyses of estimate errors and biases are needed.",

            "abstract": "Apollo missions collected lunar data from orbit and the surface, including returns from long-lived Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) stations that operated autonomously until shut-down in September, 1977. All of the early data were analyzed and reported over the duration of the Apollo missions, and some were archived, but due to several factors much of the later data were never examined or archived. In some cases, we had to search additional information sources to obtain missing critical metadata needed to understand the structure and formats. The data typically were archived on media such as microfilm or microfiche, which are not easily readable or amenable to numerical analysis, or stored on 7-track (since moved to 9-track) magnetic tape in older formats that are now complicated to process. In some cases the data did not have the necessary information to translate their output into scientifically useful numbers. In many cases where this information was available it was still necessary to reformat the numbers and describe them in a more accessible form.\nThe Lunar Data Project was started at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) National Space Science Data Center (now the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive (NSSDCA)) in 2003 to restore the archived Apollo data and convert it to usable fully-described digital data sets suitable for archive with the Planetary Data System (PDS). A committee of lunar scientists at GSFC was convened to determine the highest priority data sets for restoration. In 2007 the Lunar Data Node was created at GSFC under the auspices of the PDS Geosciences Node in order to facilitate archive of data sets with PDS. This data restoration is not only time critical due to the loss of ability to read older media, it is also urgent because many of the people with the knowledge of these data have retired and are difficult to contact. We will report on the efforts being made by the Lunar Data Project / Lunar Data Node, the specific data sets being restored, and the status of the restorations.",

            "abstract": "Reed and South Reed Rock are two hydrovolcanic tuff ring deposits in the Fort Rock Volcanic Field (FRVF), Oregon, where microbial ichnofossils (endolithic microbores) exist within basaltic glass pyroclasts. Their presence indicates that continental volcanic settings can provide a habitable environment. The secondary phase assemblage of smectite clays (nontronite), zeolites (chabazite), calcite and palagonite point to a contemporaneous to post depositional hydrothermal alteration temperature range (~25-120°C), below which microbes introduced through groundwater were able to inhabit. Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy reveals geochemical differences between fresh glass and microbore interiors (eg., Fe, Mg depletion and K and Ca enrichment). These differences are interpreted to reflect acquisition by microbes of nutrients and energy by oxidizing and dissolving fresh basaltic glass. The Black Hills, a second study area located 20 km south the Reed Rocks, consists of a series of at least 6 hydrovolcanic vents. Petrographic observations from the Black Hills also reveal microbial ichnofossil features within basaltic glass pyroclasts. Conditions necessary for a habitable environment may therefore be common throughout the FRVF. In both locations, eruptive, depositional, and hydrothermal processes led to an environment conducive to microbial activity in which glass-rich deposits possess a source of biogenic elements, energy, and water. The histories of these deposits however, may be quite different in terms of peak hydrothermal temperatures, age relationships, water content and timing. Comparison of the textural, mineralogical and geochemical properties of the Reed Rocks and Black Hills deposits is ongoing in order to gain a better understanding of the conditions of habitability in these types of deposits. These results have important astrobiological implications for Mars where basaltic pyroclastic materials are widely distributed and may represent a habitable environment.",

Evidence shows Earth's climate sensitivity and the Intertropical Convergence Zone location depend upon SO clouds. But, climate models are challenged by uncertainties and biases in the simulation of clouds, aerosols, and air-sea exchanges in this region which trace back to a poor process-level understanding. Due to the SO’s remote location, there have been sparse observations of clouds, aerosols, precipitation, radiation and the air-sea interface apart from those from satellites.\nPlans for an upcoming observational program, SOCRATES, are outlined. Based on feedback on observational and modeling requirements from a 2014 workshop conducted at the University of Washington, a plan is described for obtaining a comprehensive dataset on the boundary-layer structure and associated vertical distributions of liquid and mixed-phase cloud and aerosol properties across a range of synoptic settings, especially in the cold sector of cyclonic storms. Four science themes are developed: improved climate model simulation of SO cloud and boundary layer structure in a rapidly varying synoptic setting; understanding seasonal and synoptic variability in SO cloud condensation and ice nucleus concentration and the role of local biogenic sources; understanding supercooled liquid and mixed-phase clouds and their impacts; and advancing retrievals of clouds, precipitation, aerosols, radiation and surface fluxes. Testable hypotheses for each theme are identified.\nThe observational strategy consists of long-term ground-based observations from Macquarie Island and Davis, continuous data collection onboard Antarctic supply ships, satellite retrievals, and a dedicated field campaign covering 2 distinct seasons using in-situ and remote sensors on low- and high-altitude aircraft, UAVs, and a ship-borne platform. A timeline for these activities is proposed.",

During the last glacial maximum, it was hypothesized that the frequent winter storms provided more precipitation (COHMAP members, 1988) as the southern branch of the jet streams carried more moisture into the region (Kutzbach and Wright, 1985). However, the new global climate simulations do not provide indication of the jet stream split and some even suggest that the southern branch of the jet was weaker (Kim et al., 2008; Toracinta et al., 2004). In the last few years, the proxy records from the region have provided new information and suggested new hypothesis (Barron et al., 2012; Lyle et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2013). We present some new records of paleohydrological changes occurred over the late last glacial and deglaciation from the northwestern México. A compilation of all the important records from the region provides information about the geographic coverage of summer and winter precipitation. Minimal influence of summer as well as winter precipitation caused drier conditions over a large part of northern and northwestern Mexico (i.e. 29°-31°N) during the late last glacial (27-18 cal ka BP). Summer precipitation was restricted to the southern part of subtropical North America during >18 cal ka BP and it expanded to higher latitudes and covered different regions over the deglaciation (18-10 cal ka BP). We relate the different geographical coverage of summer precipitation to moisture flow sourced from the tropical and subtropical Pacific and Gulf of California during different intervals.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic crust formed along spreading centers in the Lau back-arc basin exhibits a dramatic change in crustal structure and composition with proximity to the nearby Tofua Arc. Results from seismic studies indicate that crust formed near the arc is abnormally thick (~8-9 km) and compositionally stratified, with a thick low-velocity upper crust and an abnormally high-velocity (7.2-7.4+ km/s) lower crust. Lava samples from this area show arc-like compositional enrichments and tend to be more evolved than typical mid-ocean ridge basalts (MgO contents as low as ~1 wt%). We propose that slab-derived water entrained in the near-arc ridge system not only enhances mantle melting, as commonly proposed to explain high crustal production in back-arc environments, but also affects magmatic differentiation and crustal accretion processes. Phase equilibria modeling of the observed compositional trends suggests that the high water contents found in near-arc parental melts can lead to crystallization of an unusually mafic cumulate layer by suppressing plagioclase crystallization relative to olivine and clinopyroxene. Model runs with ~1-2 wt% H2O in the parental melts successfully reproduce the geochemical trends of the erupted lavas while crystallizing a cumulate assemblage with calculated seismic velocities consistent with those observed in the near-arc lower crust. The resulting residual melts are also water-rich, which lowers their density and aids in the extraction and eventual eruption of unusually evolved magmas. We present preliminary results of this petrological model for the formation of back-arc oceanic crust, which successfully predicts the unusual crustal stratification observed in the near-arc regions of the Lau basin, and helps explain the highly fractionated andesites and dacites that erupt there. We also comment on alternative proposed hypotheses for back-arc crustal accretion and discuss some of the challenges facing them in this particular region.",

            "abstract": "Heat-flow mapping of the western USA has identified an apparent low-heat-flow anomaly coincident with the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, a thick sequence of basalt aquifers within the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). A heat and mass transport model (SUTRA) was used to evaluate the potential impact of groundwater flow on heat flow along two different regional groundwater flow paths. Limited in situ permeability (k) data from the CRBG are compatible with a steep permeability decrease (~3.5 orders of magnitude) at 600-900 m depth and ~40oC. Numerical simulations incorporating this permeability decrease demonstrate that regional groundwater flow can explain lower-than-expected heat flow in these highly anisotropic (kx/kz ~104) continental flood basalts. Simulation results indicate that the abrupt reduction in permeability at ~600 m depth results in an equivalently abrupt transition from a shallow region where heat flow is affected by groundwater flow to a deeper region of conduction-dominated heat flow. Abrupt k decreases at similar temperatures have also been observed in the volcanic rocks of the adjacent Cascade Range volcanic arc and at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, where they result from low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Because pore filling hydrothermal minerals are largely controlled by the major mineral assemblages of the volcanic rocks, other continental flood basalt provinces may also have large permeability changes at depths corresponding to ~40oC.",

            "abstract": "The ergodic hypothesis, implicitly used in virtually all atmospheric boundary layer studies, assumes that the time/space average of a measured flow variable converges to an ensemble of independent realizations from similar initial states and boundary conditions and for sufficiently long sampling times. Turbulent flows within roughness elements such as canopies differ from their classical boundary layer counterparts due to the short-circuiting of the energy cascade and the prevalence of von Karman vortex streets in the deeper layers of the canopy (see Figure). Despite recent experimental support for the validity of the ergodic hypothesis on turbulence statistics in the atmospheric surface layer, the impact of the aforementioned phenomena on the ergodicity of passive scalars within dense canopies remains unexplored. Using Laser Induced Florescence (LIF) measurements and flow visualization of scalar concentration within a rod canopy situated in a flume (see Figure), the necessary conditions for ergodicity of passive scalar turbulence statistics at two different depths were considered. The integral time and length scales were first analyzed and their corresponding maximum values were used to construct an ensemble of (weak) independent realizations. To within experimental limitation, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the distributions of temporal and spatial concentration series against the ensembles revealed that the ergodic hypothesis was reasonable, except close to the rods where wake-induced inhomogeneity and damped turbulence prevail. The spatial concentration statistics within a repeated rod-cell configuration appeared less ergodic than their temporal counterpart given the periodicity and persistence of von Karman vortices on the flow field. Using lagged cross-correlations of scalar concentration time series at different spatial locations, the local advection velocity of dominant eddies was inferred. The computed probability density function of the longitudinal advection velocity agreed with those measured using laser Doppler anemometry velocity time series collected in separate experiments (see Figure).",

            "abstract": "The warming rates projected by an ensemble of the Coupled Model Intercomparion Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) over southern Africa (south of 10 degrees latitude) are investigated. In all RCPs, CMIP5 models project a higher warming rate over the southwestern parts centred around the arid Kalahari and Namib deserts. The higher warming rates over these areas outpace global warming by up to a factor 2 in some GCMs. The projected warming is associated with an increase in heat waves. There is notable consensus across the models with little intermodel spread, suggesting a strong robustness of the projections. Mechanisms underlying the enhanced warming are investigated. A positive soil moisture-temperature feedback is suggested to contribute to the accelerated temperature increase. A decrease in soil moisture is projected by the GCMs over the area of highest warming. The reduction in soil wetness reduces evapotranspiration rates over the area where evaporation is dependent on available soil moisture. The reduction is evapotranspiration affects the partitioning of turbulent energy fluxes from the soil surface into the atmosphere and translates into an increase of the Bowen ratio featuring an increase in sensible relative to latent heat flux. An increase in sensible heat flux leads to an increase in near-surface temperature. The increase in temperature leads to a higher vapour pressure deficit and evaporative demand and evapotranspiration from the dry soils, possibly leading to a further decrease in soil moisture. A precipitation-soil moisture feedback is also suggested. A decrease in mean precipitation and an increase in drought conditions are projected over the area of enhanced warming. The reduced precipitation results in drier soils. The drier soil translates to reduced evapotranspiration for cloud and rainfall formation. However, the role played by the soil moisture-precipitation feedback loop is still inconclusive and characterized by some degree of uncertainty given that the strength of the local moisture recycling has not been explicitly quantified. An alternative mechanism involving the impact of soil moisture anomalies on boundary-layer stability and precipitation formation will be investigated.",

However, it is less obvious how to incorporate into this framework the other greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions, owing largely to their widely varying atmospheric lifetimes and consequent climate effect. In this presentation, I will propose a new way to compare the climate effect of a range of greenhouse gases and aerosols. I will first assess the lifetime of the temperature response to different types of emissions, which depends on the atmospheric lifetime of the gas in question, as well as the timescale of the climate system response to forcing. I will then use this timescale of temperature decay to weight emissions of a given gas over time, generating an estimate of the effective cumulative emissions that produce a given amount of temperature change at a particular time. Finally, I will illustrate the application of this method to the question of quantifying historical national contributions to global warming and determine future emission allowances for a given climate target.",

Continental dust may also play an important role in ocean fertilization and carbon sequestration. Because the lifetime of dust aerosol in the atmosphere is only on the order of days to weeks, spatial and temporal variability in concentrations and fluxes is high and understanding of recent and long term changes is limited.\nHere we present and discuss continuous, high depth resolution measurements of a range of dust proxies in a developing array of Arctic ice cores. Included are traditional proxies such as non-sea-salt (nss) calcium and insoluble particle number and size distribution as well as less traditional proxies such as rare earth elements which together provide important insights into how dust sources and transport may have changed in the past. The array includes a number of new ice core records from Greenland, the North Pacific, and Arctic Russia providing a spatial and temporal record of dust deposition to the Arctic. We compare these detailed dust records with climate and land use proxies to investigate drivers of dustiness in the Arctic during the last millennium.",

To address this problem, a 1:250,000-scale paleogeologic map of eastern Nevada, showing spatial distributions of Paleozoic-Mesozoic rocks exposed beneath a Paleogene unconformity, divided out at the formation scale, is integrated with maps of dip magnitude for Paleozoic-Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks, published sedimentary thickness records, and a published reconstruction of Basin and Range extension, in order to define and regionally-correlate thrust faults and folds, and estimate the pre-extensional amplitude, wavelength, and limb dips of folds. A new structural province, the Eastern Nevada fold belt (ENFB) is defined, and consists of a 100-150 km-wide region containing as many as five 1st-order, N-trending folds that can be traced for map distances between 100-250 km, have amplitudes between 2-4 km, wavelengths between 20-40 km, pre-extensional limb dips typically between 10-30˚, and deform rocks as young as Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. No regional-scale thrust faults or decollemont horizons breach modern exposure levels in the ENFB. ENFB folds are interpreted to have formed above a deep (≥10 km below the Paleogene unconformity), blind decollemont or shear zone, perhaps the westward projection of the master decollemont of the Sevier fold-thrust belt.\nTwo additional structural provinces of the Sevier hinterland, the Central Nevada thrust belt (CNTB) and Western Utah thrust belt (WUTB), represent zones of N-striking, E-vergent thrust faults and folds that each accommodated ca. 10 km of shortening. Both thrust belts branch northward off of the Sevier thrust belt, and are interpreted to represent contemporary, interior components of the Sevier thrust system. The CNTB, WUTB, and the intervening ENFB collectively record low-magnitude (a few 10’s of km) upper-crustal shortening that accompanied Cretaceous detachment and translation of the Cordilleran passive margin basin 220 km eastward during Sevier orogenesis. Low deformation magnitudes in the Sevier hinterland are attributed to the high rheological competence of this thick basin.",

This moderately large event was located in the Longitudinal Valley, a suture zone of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasia Plate. A joint source inversion analysis by using teleseismic body wave, GPS coseismic displacement and near field ground motion data was performed first. The inversion results derived from a western dipping fault plane indicate that the slip occurred in depths between 10 and 20 km. The rupture propagated from south to north and caused two asperities. The largest one located approximately 15 km north of the epicenter with a maximum slip about 1 m. A 3D seismic wave propagation simulation based on the spectral-element method was then carried out by using the inverted source model. A strong rupture directivity effect in the northern area of the Longitudinal Valley was found, which was due to the northward rupture process. Forward synthetic waveforms could explain most of the near-field ground motion data for frequencies between 0.05 and 0.2 Hz. This numerical earthquake model not only helps us confirm the detailed rupture processes on the Central Range Fault but also gives contribution to regional seismic hazard mitigation for future large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The last transition from full glacial to current interglacial conditions was accompanied by distinct short-term climate fluctuations caused by changes in the global ocean circulation system. Most palaeoceanographic studies focus on the documentation of the behaviour of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the last deglaciation in response to freshwater forcing events. In this respect, the role of Arctic sea ice remained relatively unconsidered - primarily because of the difficulty of its reconstruction. Here we present new proxy data on late glacial (including the Last Glacial Maximum; LGM) and deglacial sea ice variability in the Arctic Ocean and its main gateway - the Fram Strait - and how these changes in sea ice coverage contributed to AMOC perturbations observed during Heinrich Event 1 and the Younger Dryas.\nRecurrent short-term advances and retreats of sea ice in Fram Strait, prior and during the LGM, are in line with a variable (or intermittent) North Atlantic heat flow along the eastern corridor of the Nordic Seas. Possibly in direct response to the initial freshwater discharge from melting continental ice-sheets, a permanent sea ice cover established only at about 19 ka BP (i.e. post-LGM) and lasted until 17.6 ka BP, when an abrupt break-up of this thick ice cover and a sudden discharge of huge amounts of sea ice and icebergs through Fram Strait coincided with the weakening of the AMOC during Heinrich Event 1. Similarly, another sea ice maximum at about 12.8 ka BP is associated with the slowdown of the AMOC during the Younger Dryas.\nThe new data sets clearly highlight the important role of Arctic sea ice for the re-organisation of the oceanographic setting in the North Atlantic during the last deglaciation. Further studies and sensitivity experiments to identify crucial driving (and feedback) mechanisms within the High Latitude ice-ocean-atmosphere system will contribute the understanding of rapid climate changes.",

The obliquity of these systems is controlled by (i) lateral rheological variations within the lithosphere and (ii) the geodynamics of the global plate circuit. Plate tectonics and magmatism drive rheological changes within the lithosphere and consequently influences strain localization. Geodynamical evolution controls large-scale mantle convection and plate re-organization, thus triggering plate kinematics variations, and the adjustment and re-orientation of far field stresses. These geological processes explain the localization of the strain along structures that are not perpendicular to the far field stresses direction. Here we present two natural examples of oblique boundary systems: (i) the Main Ethiopian Rift, which is a transtensive plate boundary between the Nubian and Somalian plates and (ii) the Sunda Subduction Zone, which is a transpressive boundary between the overriding Sunda plate and the subducting Australian plate.\nIn extensional oblique boundary systems, field data shows dip-slip faults indicating pure extension, irrespective of the fault strike with respect to the stress direction. This observation is in total disagreement with the commonly admitted theory, which states that during oblique extension, structures that are orthogonal to the stress direction show dip-slip kinematics, whereas the ones that are oblique to the stress direction show strike-slip kinematics.\nIn compressional oblique boundary systems, field investigations along plate-scale strike slip faults allow the identification of two domains, compressional and extensional, of diffuse strain. Here, the offset between theory and nature is also relevant, with the former stating that oblique convergence activates pure dip-slip in the subduction thrust and the development of a plate-scale strike-slip fault, and the latter showing a complex distributed strain pattern.\nWe should therefore aim at deepening our understanding on the mechanics of strain distribution and its controlling factors in oblique boundary systems, through detailed analyses of their inherited conditions, their kinematics and geodynamic evolution.",

            "abstract": "Observed Arctic warming has been projected to continue in this century. Permafrost degradation is thus expected to continue, exposing large amounts of carbon for decomposition. Dynamics of Arctic landscape and hydrology are complicated due to changing climate and thawing permafrost, affecting the carbon biogeochemical cycling in the region. Further, human activities together with changing climate transform the regional land use and land cover, including wildfires, logging, and agricultural land conversion. This presentation will review the effects of factors, controls, and processes as well as landscape types (e.g., forests vs. lakes) on carbon biogeochemistry based on regional modeling studies and observations. Specific effects on carbon dynamics to be discussed will include: 1) thawing permafrost; 2) fire disturbances; 2) atmospheric carbon dioxide; 3) inorganic and organic nitrogen uptake by plants; 4) priming; 5) aerobic and anaerobic organic matter decomposition; and 6) various complexities of microbial physiology of soils. Partitioning the contribution of these processes to regional carbon dynamics shall help us improve the terrestrial biogeochemistry models, an important component of Earth System Models that are used to project our future climate.",

            "abstract": "Human biases and heuristics reflect adaptation over our evolutionary past to frequently experienced situations that affected our survival and that provided sharp distinguished feedbacks at the level of the individual. Human behavior, however, is not well adapted to the more diffusely experienced (i.e. less immediately/locally acute) problems and issues that scientists and society often seek to address today. Several human biases are identified that affect how science is conducted and used. These biases include an innate discounting of less visible phenomena/systems and of long-term perspectives; as well as a general lack of consideration of the coupling between the resources that we use and the waste that we consequently produce. Other biases include strong beliefs in human exceptionalism and separatedness from “nature”. Francis Bacon (The New Organon, 1620) provided a classification of the factors, of the “idols of the mind”, that bias pursuit of greater knowledge. How can we address these biases and the factors that affect behaviour and pursuit of knowledge; and ultimately impact the sustainability and resilience of human societies, resources and environments? A process for critical analysis is proposed that solicits explicit accounting and cognizance of these potential human biases and factors. Seeking a greater diversity of independant perspectives is essential: in both the conduct of science and in its application to the management of natural resources and environments. Accountability, traceability and structured processes are critical in this endeavor. The scientific methods designed during the industrial revolution are necessary, but insufficient, in addressing the issues of today. A new area of study in “the behavioral biogeosciences” is suggested that counters, or at least closely re-evaluates, our normal (i.e. adapted) human priorities of observation and study, as well as our judgements and decision-making.",

            "abstract": "We describe a conceptual framework for Citizen Science that can be applied to improve the understanding and management of natural resources and environments. For us, Citizen Science represents an engagement from members of the public, usually volunteers, in collaboration with paid professionals and technical experts to observe and understand natural resources and environments for the benefit of science and society. Our conceptual framework for Citizen Science includes crowdsourcing of observations (or sampling). It considers a wide range of activities, including volunteer and professional monitoring (e.g. weather and climate variables, water availability and quality, phenology, biota, image capture and remote sensing), as well as joint fact finding and analyses, and participatory mapping and modeling. Spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the biophysical processes that control natural resources and environments are taken into account within this conceptual framework, as are the availability, scaling and diversity of tools and efforts that are needed to properly describe these biophysical processes. Opportunities are sought within the framework to properly describe, QA/QC, archive, and make readily accessible, the large amounts of information and traceable knowledge required to better understand and manage natural resources and environments. The framework also considers human motivational needs, primarily through a modern version of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. We examine several USGS-based Citizen Science efforts within the context of our framework, including the project called “iCoast – Did the Coast Change?”, to understand the utility of the framework, its costs and benefits, and to offer concrete examples of how to expand and sustain specific projects. We make some recommendations that could aid its implementation on a national or larger scale. For example, implementation might be facilitated (1) through greater engagement of paid professionals, and (2) through the involvement of integrating entities, including institutions of learning and agencies with broad science responsibilities.",

            "abstract": "Many regions of subsurface interest are, or will be, fractured. In addition, these zones many be subject to varying saturations and stresses. New 3D printing techniques using different materials and structures, provide opportunities to understand porous or fractured materials and fluid effects on their elastic properties. We use a 3D printer (Stratasys Dimension SST 768) to print two rock models: a solid octahedral prism and a porous cube with thousands of penny-shaped cracks. The printing material is ABS thermal plastic with a density of 1.04 g/cm3. After printing, we measure the elastic properties of the models, both dry and 100% saturated with water. Both models exhibit VTI (Vertical Transverse Isotropic) symmetry due to laying (about 0.25 mm thick) of the printing process. The prism has a density of 0.96 g/cm3 before saturation and 1.00 g/cm3 after saturation. Its effective porosity is calculated to be 4 %. We use ultrasonic transducers (500 kHz) to measure both P- and shear-wave velocities, and the raw material has a P-wave velocity of 1.89 km/s and a shear-wave velocity of 0.91 km/s. P-wave velocity in the un-saturated prism increases from 1.81 km/s to 1.84 km/s after saturation in the direction parallel to layering and from 1.73 km/s to 1.81 km/s in the direction perpendicular to layering. The fast shear-wave velocity decreases from 0.88 km/s to 0.87 km/s and the slow shear-wave velocity decreases from 0.82 km/s to 0.81 km/s. The cube, printed with penny-shaped cracks, gives a density of 0.79 g/cm3 and a porosity of 24 %. We measure its P-wave velocity as 1.78 km/s and 1.68 km/s in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the layering, respectively. Its fast shear-wave velocity is 0.88 km/s and slow shear-wave velocity is 0.70 km/s. The penny-shaped cracks have significant influence on the elastic properties of the 3D-printed rock models. To better understand and explain the fluid effects on the elastic properties of the models, we apply the extended anisotropic Gassmann’s equations to predict the effects of saturation changes. We find that the predictions match observations from the experimental data within 1 % difference.",

            "abstract": "Chlorinated solvents tend to persist for long periods in heterogeneous porous media, in part due to sustained sources of contaminant sequestered in lower permeability zones and sorbed to the soil matrix. Sharp contrasts in soil properties have been modeled successfully using Markov Chain / Transition Probability (MC/TP) methods. This statistical approach provides a means of generating permeability fields that are consistent with prior knowledge concerning the frequency and relative positioning of different strata.To assess source zone mass depletion in a suite of such geological realizations, the large computational burden may prohibit the use of direct numerical simulations. One alternative approach is the application of a multi-rate-mass-transfer (MRMT) method, an extension of the dual-domain concept that was first developed in the soil science literature for sorption modeling. In MRMT, rather than discretizing immobile regions, such as clay layers, the concentration in these regions is treated by explicit state variables, and the transport between mobile and immobile regions is modeled by first-order exchange terms. However, in the implementation of this approach, fine-scale simulations on subdomains are often necessary to develop appropriate parameters. Such simulations are tedious, especially when attempting to account for uncertainty in the geological description. In this work, the link between characteristics of MC/TP and transfer parameters in the MRMT is evaluated by regression based on fine-scale simulations, using the simulator MODFLOW/MT3DMS. Upscaled simulation results are obtained with the same simulator, linked to an MRMT module. The results facilitate efficient assessment of reactive transport in domains with sharp contrasts in soil properties and limit the need for fine-scale numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "A new regional Earth system model of the Arctic, the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), has recently been developed. The initial version of this model includes atmosphere (WRF), ocean (POP), sea ice (CICE), and land (VIC) component models coupled with the NCAR CESM CPL7 coupler. The model is configured to run on a large pan-Arctic domain that includes all sea ice covered waters in the Northern Hemisphere and all Arctic Ocean draining land areas.\nResults from multi-decadal (1979 to present) simulations with RASM will be presented and will focus on the model climate's sensitivity to atmospheric processes and a comparison of the fully coupled model and atmosphere-only simulations. The modeled radiation budget, and sea ice cover, was found to be sensitive to the details of the cloud and radiation parameterizations in the atmospheric component (WRF) of RASM, including details of cloud droplet size. Another model sensitivity was found in relation to atmosphere-land processes. Care is needed to ensure that decoupling between the atmosphere and land do not occur under strongly stable conditions over land areas in winter.\nComparison of RASM near surface climate with that simulated with stand-alone WRF show areas of both improved and degraded results. Improvement in the coupled model climate are related to more physically realistic representation of coupled processes such as energy transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere through leads in the sea ice during winter. Degraded results come from feedbacks in model component biases, such as atmospheric circulation biases resulting in incorrect local sea ice cover that then result in large local atmospheric temperature biases.",

The deceivingly simple geometry of a surface-mounted obstacle in a boundary layer induces a complex and unsteady flow field that affect the surface drag partitioning and transport of scalars form surrounding evaporating surfaces. The readily observable spatio-temporal distribution of localized evaporation rates from infrared measured thermal signatures provide the impetus for a simple zonation scheme that enables estimates of evaporative fluxes around an obstacle. Results from evaporation experiments from sand surfaces with isolated cylindrical elements (bluff bodies) subjected to constant turbulent airflows were in good agreement with model predictions for localized exchange rates. The results show consistent enhancement of evaporating fluxes relative to a smooth surface to formation of vortices that induce thinner boundary layers. We also considered effects of obstacles on (solar) short wave radiation and energy partitioning over surfaces and successfully represented zonation of surface exchange due to momentum (drag partitioning) and variable surface energy balance on localized evaporation. A scheme for upscaling the results to evaporation from surfaces with multiple obstacles will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Continuum damage mechanics is gaining increasing acceptance as a framework for modeling flow enhancement caused by fractures in glaciers and ice shelves. To date, the temporal evolution of viscous damage has been handled using a transport equation with some kind of source term for damage. A number of empirical formulations for such a source term have been adopted, though no clear physical foundation exists for treating damage using flux terms. Furthermore, it remains to be demonstrated that the parameters of such a source term can be determined from observations. Here, we introduce a new framework for damage evolution that does not require specifying a damage source term and that results in a more intuitive physical interpretation of the coupled evolution of stress and damage. By postulating an explicit rate-weakening flow law above a threshold stress, damage can be calculated analytically from the results of a stress balance computation. A transport equation is still applied to advect damage, but the evolution of damage is explicitly linked to the evolving stress balance. This new damage formulation requires only two new parameters, both of which have clear physical interpretations and can be inferred from observations. Using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), we determine values for both parameters by inverting for damage for the remnant Larsen B ice shelf using a time series of InSAR velocity data covering the years 2000-2010. The inferred patterns of damage and strain rate, in both space and time, are used to quantify the rate-weakening constitutive parameters using nonlinear regression. The resulting damage evolution framework is then applied in perturbation experiments to determine the conditions and timescales under which the remnant Larsen B ice shelf may collapse. We conclude by discussing advantages of this approach to damage evolution and applications to problems in iceberg calving, ice shelf stability, and buttressing at the grounding line.",

            "abstract": "As permafrost thaws, previously frozen soils may become unstable and subside, in some cases forming thermo-erosional features such as gully thermokarst (GTKs). The formation of these features can result in sediment and nutrient inputs to local streams and lakes. The initial evolution of GTKs is rapid (months to several years) and appears to follow a progression in which the loss of ground ice in the soil creates a subsurface cavity that allows for the transport of water downslope, followed by the collapse of the overlying soil into the cavity, with a subsequent period of sediment and nutrient export. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the length of time these features remain unstable and actively transport sediments and nutrients. We followed the evolution of one moderately-sized (~5,000 m2) GTK located in the headwaters of the Toolik River (N68.692733° W149.205433°) on the North Slope of Alaska (USA). This feature formed in July 2003 and we monitored it for several years thereafter. In 2007 we began to monitor the shape and contours of this feature and quantified the level of ecologically important solutes it exports to the local stream. As expected, large quantities of sediment and nutrients were exported from this feature when it first formed. However, within a year or two the sediment export decreased to episodic events and the nutrient export, while elevated above reference levels, was not remarkably high. Between 2007 and the present (2014), the shape and topography of the feature have changed very little (Figure) except for some headwall retrogression, suggesting that long-term sediment transport has decreased dramatically. Thus, the overall sediment loading to the river was smaller and has decreased more rapidly than we expected. The rapid reduction in sediment and nutrient delivery is consistent with the more recent geomorphic evolution and stabilization of this feature. We conclude – contrary to our initial hypotheses – that these features form and stabilize rather quickly (~10 years) and that their influences on local streams and lakes might be ephemeral. Thus, the greater importance of these features may be as indicators of general permafrost degradation in the area and the attendant losses of carbon and other nutrients that this degradation implies.",

            "abstract": "The NSF-sponsored Summit on the Future of Undergraduate Geoscience Education made major progress toward developing a collective community vision for the geosciences. A broad spectrum of the geoscience education community, ~200 educators from research universities/four and two year colleges, focused on preparation of undergraduates for graduate school and future geoscience careers, pedagogy, use of technology, broadening participation/retention of underrepresented groups, and preparation of K-12 science teachers.\nParticipants agreed that key concepts, competencies and skills learned throughout the curriculum were more important than specific courses. Concepts included understanding Earth as complex, dynamic system, deep time, evolution of life, natural resources, energy, hazards, hydrogeology, surface processes, Earth materials and structure, and climate change. Skills/competencies included ability to think spatially and temporally, reason inductively and deductively, make and use indirect observations, engage in complex open, coupled systems thinking, and work with uncertainty, non-uniqueness, and incompleteness, as well as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and ability to think like a scientist and continue to learn. Successful ways of developing these include collaborative, integrative projects involving teams, interdisciplinary projects, fieldwork and research experiences, as well as flipped classrooms and integration and interactive use of technology, including visualization, simulation, modeling and analysis of real data. Wider adoption of proven, effective best practices is our communities’ main pedagogical challenge, and we focused on identifying implementation barriers. Preparation of future teachers in introductory and general geoscience courses by incorporating Next Generation Science Standards and using other sciences/math to solve real world geoscience problems should help increase diversity and number of future geoscientists and geoscience literacy. We also identified key elements of successful programs that attract and retain underrepresented groups, including providing financial support, reaching out to students in their communities, involving community members, incorporating role models, and mentoring.",

            "abstract": "Time-series records of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal fluid properties and flow rates have the potential to help constrain the hydrogeology, subsurface circulation patterns, heat, mass, and chemical fluxes, and habitat conditions within young oceanic crust. This potential has motivated a concerted international effort to acquire such records from a variety of geologically distinct vent fields at numerous locations along the mid-ocean ridge system. However up until now, the global database has not been systematically explored. These records have only been analyzed in a piecemeal fashion, which is problematic because hydrothermal time-series records from individual sites typically exhibit enigmatic modes of episodic and periodic variability that are difficult to interpret in isolation. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the extant set of hydrothermal time-series records from several mid-ocean ridge sites where observatory-style experiments have been conducted (including, LSHF, TAG, EPR 9°50’N and MEF).\nWe show that most temperature records, regardless of location or geological setting, display systematic tide-related variability, with the strongest signal at the principal semidiurnal tidal periods (M2, S2, N2 and K2). Cross-spectral multi-taper methods applied to the temperature and bottom pressure records reveal robust phase relationships, particularly for the high-temperature, black-smoker records, as predicted by poroelastic theory. These results suggest that tidal pressures diffusely propagate through the formation, perturbing fluid velocities and temperatures, resulting in phase lags between the seafloor loading and the exit-fluid temperatures. Here, we use multi-layer analytical and numerical models to constrain the subseafloor permeability, skin depth, and Darcy velocities required to explain the phase lag observations.",

We present new high-resolution 87Sr/86Sr data from the upper Wilkins Peak Member, to investigate linkages between astronomical forcing, water sources, and lake level in a classic rhythmic succession. Fifty-one 87Sr/86Sr ratios from White Mountain core #1 were acquired with a sampling interval of ~30 cm starting from the top of alluvial “I” bed to the lower Laney Member. The 87Sr/86Sr data show a strong and significant negative correlation with oil-yield, a traditional proxy for paleolake level and organic productivity. Application of a radioisotopic time scale, using previously dated ash beds, reveals that both 87Sr/86Sr and oil yield have a strong 20 kyr rhythm. The 87Sr/86Sr data more clearly express a longer period 100 kyr signal, similar to the Laskar 10D eccentricity solution. Using our nominal radioisotopic time scale, the Laskar 10D solution and 87Sr/86Sr data suggest that highest lake levels and greatest organic enrichment are attained during greatest precession and eccentricity.\nRegional geologic studies and modern river water analyses have shown that less radiogenic waters mostly originate west of the basin, where drainage is strongly influenced by thick Paleozoic and Mesozoic marine carbonate units. Decreased in 87Sr/86Sr therefore imply greater relative water contributions from the Sevier orogenic highlands, relative to lower relief, more radiogenic ranges lying to the east. We therefore propose that highstands of Lake Gosiute record increased penetration of Pacific moisture, related either to increased El Niño frequency or southward displacement of major storm tracks. We hypothesize that the occurrence of wetter winters caused expansion of Lake Gosiute, deposition of organic carbon rich facies, and decreased lake water 87Sr/86Sr.",

            "abstract": "Stromatolites are layered structures that form subaqueously, thereby recording chemical information about their formation environment. As such, these accretionary structures are useful tools for fine-timescale environmental reconstructions. High-resolution geochemical analyses of stromatolites that formed in paleolake Gosiute (Eocene Green River Formation) provided novel information about terrestrial environmental variability during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), the period with the highest temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels in the Cenozoic. Stromatolites from the ~51 Ma Rife Bed of the Tipton Shale Member of the Green River Formation record dramatic changes in lake volume (and correspondingly, water depth and shoreline) indicating the environment during the peak of the EECO was more variable than previously appreciated. A second set of stromatolites from the ~49 Ma Lower Laclede Bed of the Laney Member of the Green River Formation record transient periods of basin closure during a time when the basin is generally considered to have been balanced-filled. In addition, the results reveal that basin filling after desiccation was not continuous, but fluctuated before becoming an open system, further indicating local climate variability during the EECO. In both cases, major environmental changes are reflected not only in the recorded chemistry, but also in changes in stromatolite microfabric. In addition, clumped isotope paleothermometry provided estimates of water temperature from the evolving lake, which for most of its existence was so massive that it would have influenced regional climate. These and other studies demonstrate that stromatolite laminae can be used to understand fine-scale environmental variability in ancient lacustrine systems.",

            "abstract": "The brevity of the instrumental record and lack of detailed historical accounts is a limiting factor in our understanding of the relationship between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme storm events. This study applied paleotempestologic and hydrographic methods to identify the mechanisms of storm-induced coarse grain deposition and reconstruct a late Holocene storm record within Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. Three sediment cores (6.0 m, 8.4 m, and 8.2 m) were collected in 3 m of water using a vibracore system. Grain sizes were measured along core to identify coarse grain anomalies that serve as a proxy for past storm events. An historical age model (1620-2011 AD) was developed based on Pb pollution chronomarkers derived from X-Ray Florescence bulk Pb data, equating to a sedimentation rate of 8-8.3 mm/yr (R2 = 0.99). A long-term (4000 to 275 years before present) sedimentation rate of 1.1-1.4 mm/yr (R2 = 0.89) was calculated based on twenty-four continuous flow atomic mass spectrometry 14C ages of marine bivalves. To determine hydrographic conditions within the embayment during storm events current meters and tide gauges were deployed during Hurricane Irene (2011) which measured a storm surge of 88 cm above mean sea level. The buildup of storm water against the landward shoreline resulted in a measured 10 cm/s seaward moving bottom current capable of transporting coarse sand eroded from the adjacent shoreface into the coring site. Modeled surges for eleven modern and historic storm events ranged in height from 0.37 m (2011) to 3.72 m (1635) above mean high water. The WAQ1, WAQ2, and WAQ3 cores recorded a total of 89, 139, and 137 positive anomalies that exceeded the lower threshold and 15, 34, and 12 that exceeded the upper threshold respectively. Events recorded during the historic period coincide with documented storm events. The mean frequency within the three cores applying the lower threshold was 2.6 events per century, while applying the upper threshold was 0.44 events per century. The study has identified a previously understudied transport mechanism for the formation of storm-induced coarse grain horizons and highlighted some of the challenges to utilizing shallow water embayments as sites for storm reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Mercury's magnetosphere closely resembles that of Earth in terms of its topology and structure, but major differences are found when their dynamics are compared. The strong interplanetary magnetic fields at 0.3 to 0.5 AU result in low Alfven Mach numbers, weak bow shocks and low plasma β magnetosheaths at Mercury. These conditions support the development of strong plasma depletion layers adjacent to the magnetopause and intense magnetopause reconnection. MESSENGER observations indicate that reconnection occurs for all non-zero shear angles across the magnetopause with magnetosheat β being the primary factor controlling its rate. Flux transfer events (FTEs) with ~ 1-2 s durations and flux rope topology are observed during nearlly all magnetopause crossings. In contrast with the Earth where FTEs are typically observed every ~ 8 min, FTE ecounters at Mercury are separated on average by only ~ 10 s. At lower altitudes near the cusp MESSENGER observes ~1-2-s-long strong decreases in mgnetic field intensity that are termed cusp plasma filaments. These filaments are beleived to be formed by the inflow of magnetosheath plasma associated with flux transfer events. Mercury's magnetotail exhibits magnetic flux loading/unloading events similar to those observed at Earth during substorms. The Dungey cycle durations and lobe flux loading amplitudes are ~ 2 – 3 min and ~ 30 to 50% at Mercury as compared to ~ 1 - 2 hr and ~ 10 to 25% at Earth. However, FTEs at Earth account for only a few per cent of the magnetic flux carried by the Dungey cycle, while the contribution of FTEs at Mercury is estimated to be ~ 30 to 50%. Mercury also differs from Earth in that it lacks an ionosphere, but possesses a large, highly conducting iron core. The strong IMF and lack of an ionosphere results in a relatively large dawn-to-dusk cross-magnetosphere potential drop of ~ 30 kV at Mercury. Inductive coupling between Mercury's magnetosphere and its large iron core stiffens the dayside magnetosphere against compression by the strong solar wind pressure increases that accompay coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams. The effect of this inductive coupling on FTEs and other aspects of magnetospheric dynamics remains to be determined.",

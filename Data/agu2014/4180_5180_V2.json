            "abstract": "Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere lead to atmospheric deposition of sulfate (SO42-), which is the dominant strong acid anion causing acidification of surface waters and soils in the eastern United States (U.S.). Since passage of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, atmospheric deposition of SO2 in this region has declined by over 80%, but few corresponding decreases in stream-water SO42- concentrations have been observed in unglaciated watersheds. We calculated SO42- mass balances for 27 forested, unglaciated watersheds from Pennsylvania to Georgia, by using total atmospheric deposition (wet plus dry) as input. Many of these watersheds still retain SO42-, unlike their counterparts in the northeastern U.S. and southern Canada. Our analysis showed that many of these watersheds should convert from retaining to releasing SO42- over the next two decades. The specific years when the watersheds crossover from retaining to releasing SO42- correspond to a general geographical pattern of later net watershed release from north to south. The single most important variable that explained the crossover year was the runoff ratio, defined as the ratio of annual mean stream discharge to precipitation. Percent clay content and mean soil depth were secondary factors in predicting crossover year. The conversion of watersheds from net SO42- retention to release anticipates more widespread reductions in stream-water SO42- concentrations in this region.",

            "abstract": "Despite sustained increase in computing power over recent decades, computational limitations remain a major barrier to the effective and systematic use of large-scale, process-based simulation models in rational environmental decision-making. Whereas complex models may provide clear advantages when the goal of the modelling exercise is to enhance our understanding of the natural processes, they introduce problems of model identifiability caused by over-parameterization and suffer from high computational burden when used in management and planning problems. As a result, increasing attention is now being devoted to emulation modelling (or model reduction) as a way of overcoming these limitations. An emulation model, or emulator, is a low-order approximation of the process-based model that can be substituted for it in order to solve high resource-demanding problems.\nIn this talk, an overview of emulation modelling within the context of the optimal operation of water systems will be provided. Particular emphasis will be given to Dynamic Emulation Modelling (DEMo), a special type of model complexity reduction in which the dynamic nature of the original process-based model is preserved, with consequent advantages in a wide range of problems, particularly feedback control problems. This will be contrasted with traditional non-dynamic emulators (e.g. response surface and surrogate models) that have been studied extensively in recent years and are mainly used for planning purposes. A number of real world numerical experiences will be used to support the discussion ranging from multi-outlet water quality control in water reservoir through erosion/sedimentation rebalancing in the operation of run-off-river power plants to salinity control in lake and reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the technical analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assesses climate risks posed to the United States’ economy in a number of sectors [1]. Four of these - crop yield, crime, labor productivity, and mortality – draw upon research which identifies social impacts using contemporary variability in climate.\nWe first identify a group of rigorous studies that use climate variability to identify responses to temperature and precipitation, while controlling for unobserved differences between locations. To incorporate multiple studies from a single sector, we employ a meta-analytical approach that draws on Bayesian methods commonly used in medical research and previously implemented in [2]. We generate a series of aggregate response functions for each sector using this meta-analytical method. We combine response functions with downscaled physical climate projections to estimate climate impacts out to the end of the century, incorporating uncertainty from statistical estimates, weather, climate models, and different emissions scenarios.\nIncorporating multiple studies in a single estimation framework allows us to directly compare impacts across the economy. We find that increased mortality has the largest effect on the US economy, followed by costs associated with decreased labor productivity. Agricultural losses and increases in crime contribute lesser but nonetheless substantial costs, and agriculture, notably, shows many areas benefitting from projected climate changes. The ACP also presents results throughout the 21stcentury. The dynamics of each of the impact categories differs, with, for example, mortality showing little change until the end of the century, but crime showing a monotonic increase from the present day.\nThe ACP approach can expand to include new findings in current sectors, new sectors, and new geographical areas of interest. It represents an analytical framework that can incorporate empirical studies into a broad characterization of climate impacts across an economy, ensuring that each individual study can contribute to guiding policy priorities on climate change.\n",

            "abstract": "Human land use and natural processes contribute to the ability of ecosystems to store and sequester carbon and offset greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in land use (e.g. agricultural cultivation, timber harvest, urban development, and other land management strategies) and natural processes (e.g. climate, wildfire, disease, storm, and insect outbreak) drive the dynamics of ecosystem carbon pools. These carbon dynamics operate at different spatial and temporal scales, making it challenging to track the changes in a single integrative framework. Landowners, managers, and policy makers require data, information, and tools on the relative contributions of these drivers of ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes in order to evaluate alternative policies and management strategies designed to increase carbon storage and sequestration. In this paper we explore preliminary results from efforts to simulate changes in ecosystem carbon at ecoregional scales, resulting from anthropogenic land use, wildfire, natural vegetation change, and climate variability under a range of future conditions coherent with a range of global change scenarios. Simulations track the fate of carbon across several pools, including living biomass, deadwood, litter, soil, and wood products. Carbon fluxes are estimated based on simulations from the Integrated Biosphere Simulator model (IBIS). Downscaled land-use projections from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathways drive changes in land use, along with extrapolations based on local-scale data. We discuss the sensitivity of the model to individual drivers, and the overall uncertainty associated with the wide range of scenario projections, as well as explore alternative policy and management outcomes and their ability to increase carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.",

The PIC domain can cover the regions where\nkinetic effects are most important, such as reconnection sites. The\nBATS-R-US code, on the other hand, can efficiently handle the rest of\nthe computational domain where the MHD or Hall MHD description is\nsufficient. As one of the very first applications of the MHD-EPIC\nalgorithm (Daldorff et al. 2014, JCP, 268, 236) we simulate the\ninteraction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma with Ganymede's\nmagnetosphere, where the separation of kinetic and global scales\nappears less severe than for the Earth's magnetosphere. Because the\nexternal Jovian magnetic field remains in an anti-parallel orientation\nwith respect to Ganymede's intrinsic magnetic field, magnetic\nreconnection is believed to be the major process that couples the two\nmagnetospheres. As the PIC model is able to describe self-consistently\nthe electron behavior, our coupled MHD-EPIC model is well suited for\ninvestigating the nature of magnetic reconnection in this\nreconnection-driven mini-magnetosphere. We will compare the MHD-EPIC\nsimulations with pure Hall MHD simulations and compare both model\nresults with Galileo plasma and magnetic field measurements to assess the\nrelative importance of ion and electron kinetics in controlling the\nconfiguration and dynamics of Ganymede's magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates possible links between seismicity and wastewater injection in the Williston Basin and Bakken Formation in North Dakota and Montana. To identify Bakken earthquakes we analyzed seismic records collected by the EarthScope USArray temporary network of seismograph stations, deployed on a grid with 70-km spacing.\nDuring the September 2008 – May 2011 study period we identified only nine earthquakes; of these only three were near injection wells. Thus, possibly triggered earthquakes are rarer near injection wells in the Bakken than in the Barnett Shale of Texas, or in central Oklahoma.\nThe reason why Bakken earthquakes are so scarce is unclear. In many respects the Bakken/Williston region is similar to the Barnett Shale/Fort Worth Basin of Texas. In both regions injection volumes increased significantly in late 2007, and both areas have low levels of natural seismicity. Yet, in Johnson and Tarrant counties in the Barnett, earthquakes near injection wells were numerous; in the Bakken and elsewhere in the Barnett, earthquakes near wells were scarce.\nAn important result of these surveys is that the relationship between seismicity and injection/production activities varies considerably in different geographic areas. In the Bakken and western counties of Texas’ Barnett Shale, there is almost no seismic activity near injection wells. In Oklahoma, Arkansas, parts of the Barnett, and near Timpson in east Texas, there are earthquakes associated with high-volume injection wells. In the Eagle Ford of Texas earthquakes are associated primarily with production (not injection). And near Snyder, TX, recent earthquakes are associated with CO2injection.\nThis variability in response to injection complicates efforts to craft uniform policies or regulations to mitigate potential seismic hazards associated with injection practices. At a minimum it suggests that within particular geographic regions it is important to survey the relationship between seismicity and injection before considering possible policy responses or regulations. For these regional surveys, the records collected during the two-year deployment of USArray stations are valuable, although these may need to be augmented by continuing coverage.\nFigure: Earthquakes, explosions, injection wells, and coal mines in the Bakken (shaded area).",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic coast of North America provides a sedimentary record of Common Era sea levels with the resolution to identify the mechanisms that cause spatial variability in sea-level rise. This coast has a small tidal range, improving the precision of sea-level reconstructions. Coastal subsidence (from glacial isostatic adjustment, GIA) creates accommodation space that is filled by salt-marsh peat and preserves accurate and precise sea-level indicators and abundant material for radiocarbon dating. In addition, the western North Atlantic Ocean is sensitive to spatial variability in sea-level change, because of static equilibrium effects from melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, ocean circulation and wind-driven variability in the Gulf Stream and GIA induced land-level change from ongoing collapse of Laurentide forbuldge.\nWe reveal three distinct patters in sea-level during the Common Era along the North American Atlantic coast, likely linked to wind-driven changes in the Gulf Stream: (1) Florida, sea level is essentially flat, with the record dominated by long-term geological processes; (2) North Carolina, sea level falls to a minimum near the beginning of the second millennium, climbing to an early Little Ice Age maximum in the fifteenth century, and then declining through most of the nineteenth century; and (3) New Jersey, a sea-level maximum around 900 CE, a sea-level minimum around 1500 CE, and a long-term sea-level rise through the second half of the second millennium.\nWe combine the salt-marsh data from North American Atlantic coast with tide-gauge records and lower resolution proxies from the northern and southern hemispheres. We apply a noisy-input Gaussian process spatio-temporal modeling framework, which identifies a long-term falling global mean sea-level (GMSL), interrupted in the middle of the 19th century by an acceleration yielding a 20th century rate of rise extremely likely (probability P = 0:95) faster than any previous century in the Common Era.",

The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-ENLIL solar wind modeling tool has been used to calculate the values of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength (B), solar wind velocity (V) and density (n), ram pressure (~nV2), cross-magnetosphere electric field (VxB), Alfvén Mach number (MA), and other derived quantities of relevance for solar wind–magnetosphere–exosphere interactions. Such parameters as solar wind dynamic pressure are key for determining the Mercury magnetopause standoff distance, as just one example. The relatively high-time-resolution B-field data from MESSENGER can be used to estimate the strength of the product of the solar wind speed and southward IMF strength (Bs) at Mercury. This electric field drives many magnetospheric dynamical processes and can be compared with general magnetic activity indices and with the occurrence of energetic particle bursts within the Mercury magnetosphere. Such parameters also serve as input to the global magnetohydrodynamic and kinetic magnetosphere models that are used to explore magnetospheric and exospheric processes. Such modeling can help assess near-real-time magnetospheric behavior for MESSENGER (as well as other mission analysis and/or ground-based observational campaigns). This solar-wind forcing knowledge is a crucial continuing step toward bringing heliospheric science expertise to bear on solar-planetary interaction studies.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s ice cover is responding to the ongoing large-scale warming driven in part by anthropogenic forces. The highest tropical and subtropical ice fields are dramatically shrinking and/or thinning and unique climate histories archived therein are now threatened, compromised or lost. Many ice fields in higher latitudes are also experiencing and recording climate system changes although these are often manifested in less evident and spectacular ways.\nThe Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has experienced a rapid, widespread and dramatic warming over the last 60 years. Carefully selected ice fields in the AP allow reconstruction of long histories of key climatic variables. As more proxy climate records are recovered it is clear they reflect a combination of expected and unexpected responses to seemingly similar climate forcings. Recently acquired temperature and precipitation histories from the Bruce Plateau are examined within the context provided by other cores recently collected in the AP. Understanding the differences and similarities among these records provides a better understanding of the forces driving climate variability in the AP over the last century. The Arctic is also rapidly warming. The δ18O records from the Bona-Churchill and Mount Logan ice cores from southeast Alaska and southwest Yukon Territory, respectively, do not record this strong warming. The Aleutian Low strongly influences moisture transport to this geographically complex region, yet its interannual variability is preserved differently in these cores located just 110 km apart. Mount Logan is very sensitive to multi-decadal to multi-centennial climate shifts in the tropical Pacific while low frequency variability on Bona-Churchill is more strongly connected to Western Arctic sea ice extent.\nThere is a natural tendency to focus more strongly on commonalities among records, particularly on regional scales. However, it is also important to investigate seemingly poorly correlated records, particularly those from geographically complex settings that appear to be dominated by similar large-scale climatological processes. Better understanding of the spatially and temporally diverse responses in such regions will expand our understanding of the mechanisms forcing climate variability in meteorologically complex environments.",

The agreement between ground and satellite rainfall data was generally good at annual scales but a large variation was observed at the hourly scale. A trend analysis was carried out using bias-corrected annual satellite data (1998-2013) to examine the long-term patterns in rainfall amount, intensity, frequency and seasonal variations. Our results suggest that satellite rainfall estimates offer reasonable performance at annual scale.

            "abstract": "Next steps in developing next-generation crop models fall into several categories: significant improvements in simulation of important crop processes and responses to stress; extension from simplified crop models to complex cropping systems models; and scaling up from site-based models to landscape, national, continental, and global scales. Crop processes that require major leaps in understanding and simulation in order to narrow uncertainties around how crops will respond to changing atmospheric conditions include genetics; carbon, temperature, water, and nitrogen; ozone; and nutrition.\nThe field of crop modeling has been built on a single crop-by-crop approach. It is now time to create a new paradigm, moving from ‘crop’ to ‘cropping system.’ A first step is to set up the simulation technology so that modelers can rapidly incorporate multiple crops within fields, and multiple crops over time. Then the response of these more complex cropping systems can be tested under different sustainable intensification management strategies utilizing the updated simulation environments. Model improvements for diseases, pests, and weeds include developing process-based models for important diseases, frameworks for coupling air-borne diseases to crop models, gathering significantly more data on crop impacts, and enabling the evaluation of pest management strategies. Most smallholder farming in the world involves integrated crop-livestock systems that cannot be represented by crop modeling alone. Thus, next-generation cropping system models need to include key linkages to livestock. Livestock linkages to be incorporated include growth and productivity models for grasslands and rangelands as well as the usual annual crops. There are several approaches for scaling up, including use of gridded models and development of simpler quasi-empirical models for landscape-scale analysis.\nOn the assessment side, AgMIP is leading a community process for coordinated contributions to IPCC AR6 that involves the key modeling groups from around the world including North America, Europe, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, and Australia and Oceania. This community process will lead to mutually agreed protocols for coordinated global and regional assessments.",

The project developed new methods integrating climate, crop, livestock and economic models to conduct climate change impact assessments that characterize impacts on smallholder groups. AgMIP projections of climate change impacts on agriculture are more realistic than previous assessments because they take agricultural development into account. Using the best available data and models, the assessments directly evaluated yield, income, and poverty outcomes including the effects of adaptation packages and development pathways.\nResults show that even with agricultural development, climate change generally will exert negative pressure on yields of smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Without adaptation, climate change leads to increased poverty in some locations in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia compared to a future in which climate change does not occur. Adaptation can significantly improve smallholder farmer responses to climate change. AgMIP expert teams identified improved varieties, sowing practices, fertilizer application, and irrigation applications as prioritized adaptation strategies. These targeted adaptation packages were able to overcome a portion of detrimental impacts but could not compensate completely in many locations. Even in cases where average impact is near zero, vulnerability (i.e., those at risk of loss) can be substantial even when mean impacts are positive.",

            "abstract": "Coseismic slip in the 2008 Wenchuan, China earthquake was highly heterogeneous in both magnitude and rake. The slip was predominantly thrust slip on shallow dipping fault segments near the epicenter, rotating to strike-slip on more steeply dipping fault segments to the northeast. The earthquake ruptured along the front of the Longmenshan, one of the steepest and highest mountain ranges on Earth. Fault segments that slipped in a reverse sense roughly correspond to regions of larger topographic gradients than segments that slipped in strike-slip. The weight of the mountains result in highly variable fault shear stresses on order of 10 MPa and normal stresses up to 80 MPa. The heterogeneity of coseismic slip might indicate a heterogeneity in pre-earthquake stresses, possibly influenced by the heterogeneity of topographic relief. We constrain the accumulated stress that led to the Wenchuan earthquake in a probabilistic manner using geodetically and seismically constrained coseismic slip models, aftershock focal mechanisms, and topographic stresses. We find that coseismic slip models are consistent with a homogeneous pre-earthquake stress orientation along the Longmenshan, although those models are unable to constrain the stress magnitude. We also find that the majority of the aftershocks are broadly consistent with the stress inferred from the mainshock, and that significant rotation of the stress during the Wenchuan earthquake is not required to explain the disparate mechanisms of the aftershocks. More importantly, we find that topographic shear stresses are generally opposed to the direction of fault slip, and thus that the Wenchuan earthquake worked against topographic loading. Given that tectonic stresses needed to overcome topographic stresses for the Wenchuan earthquake to have occurred, allows us to determine a minimum bound on the magnitude of accumulated tectonic stress, in addition to fault friction and pore-pressure. While we find that heterogeneities in topographic fault shear stresses likely did not lead to heterogeneities in the earthquake slip, a negative correlation between slip magnitude and topographic normal stress magnitude suggests that normal stresses may influence fault arrest.",

            "abstract": "Closing the sea level budget is a most important scientific and societal issue of climate change. Here, we report on the status of ice sheets and glaciers mass balance throughout the world and their contribution to sea level rise using time series of time-variable gravity from the NASA/DLR GRACE satellite mission for the time period 2003-2014. We also evaluate static regional sea level variations (or sea level fingerprints, SLF) from these observations of ice sheet and glacier loss, combined with observations of changes in global land hydrology also from GRACE, and water input from the atmosphere from re-analysis data. We evaluate the relative contribution of each component to regional sea level. We compare the cumulative SLF signal at global scale and at the scale of large ocean basins with satellite altimetry data corrected for the steric component from Argo floats. We find an excellent agreement between the two datasets. Although the regional SLF do not include sea level variations from ocean dynamics that re-distributes water mass around the world’s oceans at the analyzed scales, we find that the SLF represent a large fraction of the trend and annual amplitude of the sea level signal. We also show an analysis of the contributions of regional sea level from mass changes in Greenland and Antarctica going back to the 1970s.

            "abstract": "Drill coring at Lake El’gygytgyn (Far East Russia) in 2009 retrieved a 3.6 Ma long sediment core, which is presently the oldest continuous sedimentary record available from the terrestrial Arctic. This unique Plio-Pleistocene record allows for the response of the Arctic to global climate events under a variety of different boundary conditions to be examined. Here we present results of ongoing organic geochemical analyses of Lake El’gygytgyn sediments focusing on the mid-Pliocene warm period, the Plio-Pleistocene transition, the mid-Brunhes transition, and warm Pleistocene interglacial periods including Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5, 9, 11, 19 and 31. Despite the ultra-oligotrophic nature of Lake El'gygytgyn and the generally low sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content, we find abundant branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) throughout the entire record and use the methylation and cyclization indices of branched tetraethers (MBT and CBT, respectively) to reconstruct past temperature (Weijers et al., 2007). We hypothesize that the majority of brGDGTs are produced in the lake during the brief summer period of ice free conditions and that MBT/CBT likely reflects a warm season temperature. Trends noted in the MBT/CBT record are in close agreement with pollen-based temperature estimates throughout the entire core. For example, we note a dramatic ~6°C cooling associated with the mid-Pliocene M2 event and thus far MIS 31 has emerged as the warmest period at Lake El’gygytgyn during the past ~ 1 Ma, corroborating the pollen data. Interestingly, a number of abrupt and relatively short-lived cooling events of 2 to 4°C are noted within several of the particularly warm interglacial periods (e.g. MIS 5e, MIS 11 and MIS 31) and are the subject of ongoing investigation. Overall, application of the MBT/CBT paleothermometer to Lake El’gygytgyn sediments is a highly promising technique for generating a Plio-Pleistocene temperature record from the continental Arctic although a site specific calibration is required before absolute temperature can be reconstructed with confidence from brGDGTs.",

            "abstract": "The rate of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet quadrupled over the last two decades and may be due in part to changes in ocean heat transport to marine-terminating outlet glaciers. Meltwater commonly discharges at the grounding line in these outlet glacier fjords, generating a turbulent upwelling plume that separates from the glacier face when it reaches neutral density. This mechanism is the current paradigm for setting the magnitude of net heat transport in Greenland’s glacial fjords. However, sufficient observations of meltwater plumes are not available to test the buoyancy-driven circulation hypothesis. Here, we use an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm) of the near-glacier field to investigate how plume water properties, terminal height, centerline velocity and volume transport depend on the initial conditions and numerical parameter choices in the model. These results are compared to a hydrodynamic mixing model (CORMIX), typically used in civil engineering applications. Experiments using stratification profiles from the continental shelf quantify the errors associated with using far-field observatons to initialize near-glacier plume models. The plume-scale model results are then integrated with a 3-D fjord-scale model of the Rink Isbrae glacier/fjord system in west Greenland. We find that variability in the near-glacier plume structure can strongly control the resulting fjord-scale circulation. The fjord model is forced with wind and tides to examine how oceanic and atmospheric forcing influence net heat transport to the glacier. ",

            "abstract": "Tephras preserved in lake sediments are commonly used to synchronize sedimentary archives of climate and environmental change, and to correlate them with terrestrial environments. They also provide an opportunity to reconstruct explosive volcanic activity, e.g., eruption frequency and tephra dispersal. Although it is known that sedimentary processes may affect the record of tephras in lakes, lake sediments are generally considered as one of the best archives of tephra stratigraphy. The June 2011 eruption of the Cordón Caulle (CC, Chile, 40ºS) offered an ideal opportunity to study the processes affecting tephra deposition in lakes. During the 2011 CC eruption, the prevailing westerly winds transported the erupted pyroclastic material away from Puyehue Lake. Yet, the tephra was identified within the lake with a thickness ranging from 1 cm to >10 cm. This is in contrast with smaller lakes, where tephra thickness was in agreement with ash fall distribution maps. Geomorphological observations and sedimentological analyses provide evidence that the tephra deposited in Puyehue Lake entirely consists of material reworked from the upper watershed, transported by rivers, and distributed by lake currents according to particle size and density. Proximal basins mostly received coarse tephra particles via underflows, while in distal basins the deposits consisted of low amounts of fine-grained particles transported by interflows. Pumice transported by overflows reached most lake basins. These results have important implications for tephrochronology and volcanology. First, they show that lakes do not act as passive tephra traps, and they illustrate how two nearby lakes can contain very distinct tephra records, simply due to the size and orientation of their drainage basins. Second, they show that lakes with large watersheds, such as Puyehue, record many more eruptions than smaller lakes, which only register direct ash falls, leading to very different conclusions regarding the recurrence of volcanic eruptions. Finally, our data show that using lakes with large watersheds for isopach mapping systematically leads to an overestimation of the area affected by ash deposition, and of the volume of erupted tephra. Smaller lakes with limited drainage basins are therefore better suited for volcanological studies.",

            "abstract": "Predicting volcanic activity requires continuous monitoring for signals of magmatic unrest in harsh, often remote environments. BENTO is a next-generation monitoring system, currently in prototype testing, that is highly portable, low-cost, rapidly deployable, and entirely autonomous. Such a system could be used to provide critical monitoring and data collection capabilities during rapid-onset eruptions, or to provide a crude baseline monitor at large numbers of remote volcanoes to 'flag' the onset of unrest so that costlier resources such as specialized instrumentation can be deployed in the appropriate place at the appropriate time. The BENTO 1 (low-rate data) prototype currently comprises off-the-shelf volcanic gas sensors (SO2, CO2, Fl, Cl, and Br), a weather station (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, humidity, pressure), and telemetry via Iridium modem. In baseline mode, BENTO 1 takes a measurement from all of its sensors every two hours and automatically sends the measurements through Iridium to a server that posts them to a dedicated and customizable web page. The measurement interval and other sensor parameters (pumping time, sensor constants) can be adjusted directly or remotely (through the Iridium network) as needed. Currently, BENTO 1 is deployed at Mt. Etna, Italy; Telica Volcano, Nicaragua, Hengill Volcano, Iceland; and Hekla Volcano, Iceland. The BENTO 2 (high-rate) system is motivated by a need to avoid having to telemeter raw seismic data, which at 20-100 Hz/channel is far too voluminous for cost- and power-effective transmission through satellite networks such as Iridium. Our solution is to regularly transmit only state-of-health information and descriptions of the seismic data (e.g., 'triggered' seismic event rates and amplitudes), rather than the data itself. The latter can be accomplished through on-board data analysis and reduction at the installation site. Currently, it is possible to request specific time segments of raw seismic data from a BENTO 2 through the Iridium network, based on regularly transmitted lists of automated trigger times, allowing verification of any apparent changes in seismic event rate. BENTO 2 prototypes have recently been deployed at Telica Volcano, Nicaragua; and Hekla Volcano, Iceland.",

            "abstract": "Increasing climate variability and extreme weather conditions along with declining trends in both rainfall and temperature represent major risk factors affecting agricultural production and food security in many regions of the world. We identify regions where significant rainfall decrease from 1979-2011 over the entire continent of Africa couples with significant human population density increase. The rangelands of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the East African Horn remain one of the world’s most food insecure regions, yet have significantly increasing human populations predominantly dependent on pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods. Vegetation in this region is characterized by a variable mosaic of land covers, generally dominated by grasslands necessary for agro-pastoralism, interspersed by woody vegetation. Recent assessments indicate that widespread degradation is occurring, adversely impacting fragile ecosystems and human livelihoods. Using two underutilized MODIS products, we observe significant changes in vegetation patterns and productivity over the last decade all across the East African Horn. We observe significant vegetation browning trends in areas experiencing drying precipitation trends in addition to increasing population pressures. We also found that the drying precipitation trends only partially statistically explain the vegetation browning trends, further indicating that other factors such as population pressures and land use changes are responsible for the observed declining vegetation health. Furthermore, we show that the general vegetation browning trends persist even during years with normal rainfall conditions such as 2012, indicating potential long-term degradation of rangelands on which approximately 10 million people depend. These findings have serious implications for current and future regional food security monitoring and forecasting as well as for mitigation and adaptation strategies in a region where population is expected to continue increasing against a backdrop of drying climate trends.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis fundamentally changed the structure of the marine biosphere and the chemistry of Earth’s ocean-atmosphere system. Atmospheric oxygenation, however, was decoupled from the onset of biological O2 production—possibly lagging by as much as half a billion years—and O2 remained low for two billion years following initial O2 accumulation. Although uncertainties remain regarding the fate of biogenic O2 during the Precambrian, it is becoming clear that the consequences of oxygenesis were both spatially and temporally variable. Several lines of evidence support the existence of aerobic ecosystems associated with O2 oases within an otherwise anoxic Archean ocean; however—with notable exceptions—atmospheric O2 remained low enough to severely curtail oxidative weathering processes on long-term average throughout the Archean. During the subsequent Great Oxidation Event (GOE) in the early Paleoproterozoic, atmospheric O2 irreversibly increased above the sensitivity thresholds of several well-established proxies, but the level at which O2 eventually stabilized remains unclear. Consequently, the dynamics of O2 cycling are poorly characterized both before and after the GOE. Nevertheless, recent analytical and numerical results suggest exceptionally low O2 levels that may have favored Archean-style O2 oases in the mid-Proterozoic.\nWe used Fe speciation and trace metal records from Precambrian shales, including data from two new cores that target the 2.7 Ga Roy Hill Shale, to investigate pre- and post- GOE redox heterogeneity in Earth’s surface environments. Fe speciation supports the reconstruction of local marine redox conditions, and, in this context, trace metals can allow glimpses of redox conditions beyond the local environment, which may have throttled the supply of key redox-sensitive trace metals to the ocean. Then, using O2 constraints derived from these inorganic proxies, we use an Earth System model to explore C, O, and nutrient cycling in the late Archean and into the mid-Proterozoic. Although our results allow profound perturbation to several biogeochemical cycles and the climate system as a result of the GOE, we find that the GOE may have had only minor significance for the long-term average O2 content of typical surface seawater in the Proterozoic.",

            "abstract": "The Arabian Peninsula experiences severe air pollution yet is highly understudied in terms of surface measurements of ozone and its precursors. Every year the air pollution in Saudi Arabia is intensified by additional traffic and activities during Hajj, the world’s largest religious pilgrimage that draws 3‒4 million pilgrims to Mecca (population of 2 million). Using whole air sampling and high-precision measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and 97 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we performed an initial survey of air quality in Mecca, its tunnels, and surrounding holy sites during the 2012 Hajj (October 24-27; n = 77). This is the first time such a campaign has been undertaken. Levels of the combustion tracer CO and numerous VOCs were strongly elevated along the pilgrimage route, especially in the tunnels of Mecca, and are a concern for human health. For example CO reached 57 ppmv in the tunnels, exceeding the 30-min exposure guideline of 50 ppmv. Benzene, a known carcinogen, reached 185 ppbv in the tunnels, exceeding the 1-hr exposure limit of 9 ppbv. The gasoline evaporation tracer i-pentane was the most abundant VOC during Hajj, reaching 1200 ppbv in the tunnels. Even though VOC concentrations were generally lower during a follow-up non-Hajj sampling period (April, 2013), many were still comparable to other large cities suffering from poor air quality. Major VOC sources during Hajj included vehicular exhaust, gasoline evaporation, liquefied petroleum gas, and air conditioners. Of the measured compounds, reactive alkenes (associated with gasoline evaporation) and CO showed the strongest potential to form ground-level ozone. Therefore efforts to curb ozone formation likely require dual targeting of both combustive and evaporative fossil fuel sources. However, modeling and other measurements (e.g., nitrogen oxides) are also needed to fully understand Mecca’s oxidative environment. We also present specific recommendations to reduce VOC emissions and exposure in Mecca, and to strengthen air quality monitoring especially in Mecca’s tunnels.",

            "abstract": "On July 15, 2004 the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was successfully launched on board of NASA’s EOS-Aura spacecraft. OMI is the first of a new generation of UV/VIS nadir solar backscatter imaging spectrometers, which provides nearly global coverage in one day with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 13 x 24 km2. OMI measures solar irradiance and Earth radiances in the wavelength range of 270 to 500 nm with a spectral resolution of about 0.5 nm. OMI is designed and built by the Netherlands and Finland, and is also a third party mission of ESA.\nThe major step that was made in the OMI instrument compared to its predecessors is the use of 2-dimensional detector arrays (CCDs) in a highly innovative small optical design. These innovations enable the combination of a high spatial resolution and a good spectral resolution with daily global coverage. OMI measures a range of trace gases (O3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, BrO, OClO, H2O), clouds and aerosols. Albeit OMI is already 5 years over its design lifetime, the instrument is still fully operational. The successor of OMI is TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on the Copernicus Sentinel-5 precursor mission, planned for launch in 2016.\nOMI's unique capabilities rely in measuring tropospheric trace gases with a small footprint and daily global coverage. The unprecedented spatial resolution of the instrument revealed for the first time tropospheric pollution maps on a daily basis with urban scale resolution leading to improved air quality forecasts. The OMI measurements also improve our understanding of air quality and the interaction between air quality and climate change by combining measurements of air pollutants and aerosols. In recent years the data are also used for obtaining high-resolution global emission maps using inverse modelling or related techniques, challenging the bottom-up inventories based emission maps. In addition to scientific research, OMI also contributes to several operational services, including volcanic plume warning systems for aviation, UV forecasts and air quality forecasts.\nIn this presentation an overview will be given of the unique contribution of the OMI instrument to atmospheric composition research from space",

            "abstract": "Bursty enhancements of hot electrons (~0.5 to 5 keV) with duration of minutes often occur in the tail magnetosheath. Determining the sources and energization of these hot electrons is important to understanding the coupling of the mangetosheath with the bowshock or magnetosphere. In this study we used the unique simultaneous measurements from the two ARTEMIS probes to investigate the likely source locations, spatial structures, and responsible processes for these hot electron enhancements. The enhancements can be seen at any distances across the magnetosheath, but those closer to the magnetopause more often have magnetosheath density and flow magnitudes decreased to more magnetosphere-like values. From simultaneous measurements of these enhancements with the two probes being on either side of magnetopause or both in the magnetosheath, it is evident that these hot electrons come from the magnetosphere near the current sheet without further energization, and that the enhancements are a result of bursty lateral magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath, with weaker enhancements and smaller changes in the magnetosheath properties further outward from the intrusion. Using simultaneous observations having different separation distances and alignments between the probes, we estimated that a single isolated enhancement can have a thin and elongated structure as narrow as 2 RE wide in the X direction, as long as more than 7 RE in the Y direction, and as thin as 1 RE in the Z direction. From observed correlations between the enhancements seen on the magnetosheath side and magnetosheath intrusion seen on the magnetosphere side, we propose that Kelvin-Helmholtz perturbations at the magnetopause and subsequent magnetosphere-magnetosheath particle mixing due to reconnection or diffusion can plausibly explain the bursty magnetosphere intrusion deep into the magnetosheath and the different decreases of magnetosheath density and flow associated with the hot electron enhancements.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is formed through the partial decomposition and transformation of plant organic matter (OM) inputs. While much is known about how climate, litter chemistry, and decomposer community composition affect the rate at which plant inputs are decomposed, we argue that mass loss rates are of little importance to long-term net soil C and N balance. Rather, what really matters is the proportion of plant OM inputs that is eventually incorporated into SOM and further stabilized by spatial inaccessibility or through interactions with minerals versus the amount which is mineralized. Above ground plant inputs enter the soil in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and litter fragments, yet we have very little data on those two fluxes and how DOM and litter fragments contribute to SOM formation and stabilization. Through an integrated set of laboratory and modelling work and a long-term field decomposition experiment using 13C and 15N labelled plant OM we are elucidating the controls of DOM versus CO2 production during decomposition and the fate and stabilization of DOM and litter fragments in soil, and soil fragments, to a 20 cm depth. Our work shows that during the early stages of decomposition, a sizable fraction of litter C is lost to the soil in the form of DOM, and that this flux is largely controlled by the initial litter chemistry (i.e., %N and lignocellulose index). This DOM appears to be fast transformed by microbes and to stabilize on mineral particles. Later, most of the litter enters the soil in the form of litter fragments, recovered as light fraction in the soil, where they accumulate, likely due to their chemical recalcitrance. In agreement with the Microbial Efficiency Mineral Stabilization framework we observed the highest litter-C mineral stabilization efficiency during the early stages of decomposition when the most labile litter components are lost.",

            "abstract": "Although the occurrence of aeolian sands in sedimentary sequences has been widely used as indicators of desert formation or proxies of desert climate, one should be aware that accumulation of aeolian sands does occur along river channels, in lake shores not necessarily associated with arid environment. Our ongoing geomorphological and paleoenvironmental studies in the deserts of northern China reconfirm that formation of sand seas is dependent on not only erodibility (arising from bare surface due to aridity) and wind power but more importantly sand availability related to sediment cycles under interactions between fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian processes. Here we present our ongoing geomorphological and paleoclimatic research on the Late Quaternary landscape and climatic changes in the Taklamkan Desert of northwestern China, the largest sand sea of China in arid zone, and in the Hunshandake Sandy Land at the east part of the Asian mid-latitude desert belt under semiarid climate. We find out that the occurrence of tall sand dunes in the over 300,000 km2 large Taklamakan Sand Sea is closely related to the sites of intensive fluvial sedimentation and convergence zone of surface winds. In the case of Hunshandake, the dunes (although much smaller) mainly occur along the shorelines of the former lake basins, and sediment sources are generally limited because of open hydrological systems in the south and east portions of this desert. The sedimentological and geomorphological records suggest that the climate has changed between arid and less-arid conditions in both of these deserts during Late Quaternary. Under wetter conditions the Taklamakan acts as an important sink of sediments brought by rivers with headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau and Tianshan, while under more arid conditions it acts as an important global sediment source whose dust is transported not only to East Asia and Pacific but also to Greenland ice via westerlies. The Hunshandake has the same pattern of function in global sedimentary cycles but with a much smaller role because of smaller extension and weaker relief energy. The Taklamkan and Hunshandake are potentially ideal laboratories for understanding interactions between global sediments fluxes, climate change, hydrological systems and tectonics.",

Particular focus is placed on how the existence of and interactions between three MJO events, 10 Kelvin waves (KWs), and the diurnal cycle impact convective system properties. For example, the average MJO characteristics were generally consistent with past studies, although an increase in deep convective rain and echo tops appeared to precede relative humidity increases at low- to middle-levels. MJO convective organization was also impacted by deep tropospheric wind shear. The active and developing MJO KWs produced more rain and cloud than suppressed MJO KWs and had a secondary peak in stratiform rain potentially associated with subsynoptic-scale cloud clusters. The diurnal cycle of rain was also more pronounced during the active MJO. The suppressed MJO KW composite displayed previously documented structure of vertical moisture buildup prior to the KW passage, whereas the developing and active MJO KWs did not. Upper level moisture was enhanced after KW passages, regardless of MJO phase. However, upper level moisture was most enhanced after the developing MJO KW passage, providing deep tropospheric moisture that may have assisted MJO onset. Non-precipitating upper level cloud and midlevel altocumulus/altostratus also persisted after most KW passages with potential radiative impacts.",

            "abstract": "The standard approach to modeling injection-induced seismicity (IIS) considers Coulomb failure stress changes accounting only for pore-pressure changes, which are solved by the diffusion equation. However, this “diffusion” triggering mechanism is not comprehensive. Lab experiments indicate earthquake nucleation also depends on stress history. Here we add two effects in modeling IIS: 1) poro-elastic coupling between solid stresses and pore-pressure, and 2) time dependent earthquake nucleation under applied stresses.\nIn this model, we compute stress and pore-pressure changes due to a point source injecting in a homogeneous, poro-elastic full space (Rudnicki, 1986). The Coulomb stress history is used to compute seismicity rate changes based on the time-dependent nucleation model of Dieterich (1994). Our new model reveals: 1) poro-elastic coupling breaks the radial symmetry in seismicity, 2) nucleation introduces a characteristic nucleation time ta, which affects the temporal evolution of seismicity rates, and 3) for some fault geometries, the seismicity rate may increase following shut in.\nFor constant injection flux, the log of seismicity rate scales with the change in Coulomb stress at short time, consistent with diffusion profiles. At longer time, the model predicts seismicity rates decaying with time, consistent with some observations. The contour shape and decay time are characterized by ta. For finite injection with box-car flux history, seismicity rates plummet near the injector, but may continue for some time at greater distance. Depending on fault orientations, seismicity rates may increase after shut-in due to coupling effects. It has been observed in some cases that the maximum magnitude of induced quakes occurs after shut-in. This may be understood by the fact that the volume of perturbed crust increases with injection time, which influences probability of triggering an event of a given magnitude. Whether coupling effects are important in post shut-in behavior is unknown, however we show that gradually decreasing injection flux can eliminate the post shut-in seismicity increase.",

            "abstract": "During 18 years since the deployment of K-NET following the Kobe earthquake, our attention has mainly focused on rapidity of the data collection and an unfailing and reliable observation. In this presentation, we review three generations of the instruments employed by K-NET and KiK-net from these two points of view.\nAt beginning of the 2000’s, we newly developed the second generation instruments (K-NET02, K-NET02A, KiK-net06) to replace the first generation instruments (K-NET95, SMAC-MDK) employed when the networks were constructed in the 1990’s. These instruments have an automatic dial-out function. It takes typically 2–5 s to establish communication and a few seconds to send the pre-trigger data. After that, data is available typically within a 1.5 s delay. Not only waveform data but also strong motion indexes such as real-time intensity, PGA, PGV, PGD, and response spectra are continuously sent once a second.\nAfter the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, we have developed the third generation instruments (K-NET11, KiK-net11) and have replaced almost half of the all stations country wide. Main improvement of this instrument is more unfailing and reliable observation. Because we have often experienced very large ground motions (e.g. 45 records exceeding gravity), the maximum measureable range was expanded from 2000 gal to 4000 gal for the second generation instrument, and to 8000 gal for the third. For the third generation instrument, in case of power failure, observation (including transmission of data) works for seven days thanks to the backup battery, while for the second generation instruments it works only for one day. By adding an oblique component to the three-component accelerometers, we could automatically distinguish shaking data from noise such as electric pulses which may cause a false alarm in EEW. Implementation to guarantee the continuity of observation under severe conditions such as during the Tohoku earthquake is very important, as well as a highly efficient observation.\nOwning to the drastic progress of information technologies, continuous observation has become technically and economically feasible and some of stations are experimentally equipped with a continuous communication line. Continuous observation offers very important information to help mitigating ongoing earthquake disasters.",

Traversing through a diverse climatic regime across the Plain and through precipitation zones ranging from 600 mm/year near Delhi to 1200 mm/year in the eastern plains, the Ganga River system has formed very diverse landform assemblages in its major domains that include a) hinterlands, b) northern Plain, c) southern Plain, d) main valley system, e) interfluve systems, and f) major tributaries. Using satellite images, mapping of the Ganga River channel belt and its active floodplain from Gangotri (source) to Farakka (upstream of its confluence with the Brahmaputra) has brought out extreme diversity in channel form, active floodplain and valley margin characteristics, and reach-scale fluvial processes.\nFollowing a modified River Style Framework, we have recognized a total of 10 different river styles for the trunk river from Gangotri to Farakka based on a) landscape setting, b) channel and active floodplain properties, and c) channel planform parameters. The mountainous stretch is characterized by steep valleys and bedrock channels, and is dominated by large-scale sediment production and transport through hill slope processes. The alluvial part of the river is characterized by 8 different styles of varying reach lengths (60-300 km) many of which show sharp transitions in landscape setting e.g. from piedmont to valley-interfluve and from alluvial to craton margin. Each river style in the alluvial reaches has a distinctive set of morphological parameters primarily driven by the dominant fluvial process operating in that stretch such as channel instability and river dynamics, channel incision or aggradation and frequent flooding. Our study has provided a physical template for characterizing the complexity of a large river system and for reach-scale geomorphic assessment of river health, which is the first step towards developing ecology-based river management strategy.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics and soil surface processes (e.g. runoff, soil erosion, sedimentation) are tightly coupled in drylands, where vegetation cover is patchy and plant production largely depends on favourable redistribution of water and sediments. At the same time, the amount and spatial distribution of vegetation control hillslope runoff and erosion, and strongly influence the redistribution of water and soil resources in these systems. Large shifts in the structure and organization of vegetation are associated with land degradation, frequently involving nonlinear responses to both human and climatic pressures. The study of landform-water-vegetation feedbacks has, therefore, a critical role for the comprehension of ecosystem stability and restoration potential in arid and semiarid environments. We present a synthesis of field-based, remote-sensed and modelling studies on soil-vegetation patterns in semiarid rangelands of Australia and water-restricted reclaimed mining slopes of Spain. Our results indicate that the organization and stability of vegetation patterns strongly depends on feedbacks with coevolving landforms. Exploration of degradation trends in banded Mulga shrublands of central Australia reveals that human disturbances (e.g. grazing) can strongly alter landform-water-vegetation feedbacks and particularly the way water is spatially redistributed and used by vegetation, resulting in threshold-like responses of ecosystem function. Successful experiences on the restoration of these systems highlight that the management of runoff and sediment flows is decisive to recover vegetation patchiness and landscape function. The study of vegetation-water-landform feedbacks in Mediterranean-dry reclaimed mining slopes of Spain offers additional indications on the restoration of drylands, particularly on the effects of rill and gully erosion on the stability of restored vegetation. The development of rill and gully networks provides very efficient drainage networks for the routing of water and sediments, which drastically reduce the availability of resources for plant production and ultimately can cause irreversible ecosystem changes.",

            "abstract": "Dramatic changes are taking place throughout the Arctic. Many glaciers have already melted away completely, and most others are well on their way as rising snowline elevations promise continued glacier retreat. Emerging from beneath retreating glacier margins is a landscape rich in information about past climate and glacier changes. Within newly exposed bedrock is an inventory of cosmogenic nuclides that archive past ice cover timing and duration. Lake basins re-appearing due to retreating ice preserve sediment archives that tell of cooling climate and advancing ice. And ancient surfaces vegetated with tundra communities that have long been entombed beneath frozen-bedded ice caps are now being revealed for the first time in millennia. This presentation will focus on the climate and glacier record derived from radiocarbon dating of in situ moss recently exhumed from retreating local ice cap margins on western Greenland. Dozens of radiocarbon ages from moss group into several distinct modes, which are interpreted as discrete times of persistent summer cooling and resultant glacier expansion. The data reveal a pattern of glacier expansion beginning ~5000 years ago, followed by periods of glacier growth around 3500 and 1500 years ago. Because these times of glacier expansion are recorded at many sites in western Greenland and elsewhere in the Arctic, they are interpreted as times of step-wise summer cooling events during the Holocene. These non-linear climate changes may be a result of feedbacks that amplify linear insolation forcing of Holocene climate. In addition to these insights into the Arctic climate system, the antiquity of many radiocarbon ages of ice-killed moss indicate that many arctic surfaces are being re-exposed for the first time in millennia due to retreating ice, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of current summer warming.",

            "abstract": "Carbon cycling in the rhizosphere is a nexus of biophysical interactions between plant roots, microorganisms, and the soil organo-mineral matrix. Plant roots are the primary inputs of soil organic C; the presence of roots significantly alters rates of organic matter mineralization by soil microbes. Our research on how roots influence decomposition of soil organic matter in both simplified and complex microcosms uses geochemical characterization, molecular microbiology, isotope tracing, ‘omics and novel imaging approaches (‘ChipSIP’ and ‘STXM-SIMS’) to trace the fate of isotopically labelled root exudates and plant tissues. Our work seeks to understand the genomic basis for how organic C transformation and decomposition in soil is altered by interactions between plant roots and the soil microbial community (bacteria, archaea, fungi, microfauna). We hypothesize that root-exudate stimulation of soil microbial populations results in the altered expression of transcripts and proteins involved in decomposition of macromolecular C compounds. Using an isotope array that allows us to follow root C into bacterial, fungal, and microfaunal communities, we have tracked movement of 13C from labeled exudates and 15N from labeled root litter into the soil microbial community, and linked this data to 16S profiles and community gene transcripts. By integrating stable isotopes as tracers of natural resource utilization (i.e. root litter), and analysis of the functional properties of the communities that respond to those resources, we can identify the molecular pathways that are stimulated in the soil microbiome in response to root litter, living roots, and their interfaces.",

            "abstract": "The Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) field campaign took place in the Indian Ocean during boreal winter of 2011-2012 to collect observations of the initiation of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events. Hindcast experiments are conducted for the first two MJO events of DYNAMO from 01 October – 15 December 2011 with two atmospheric models, one that uses conventional parameterization (CAM) and another that employs super-parameterization (SP-CAM). Increased convective entrainment in CAM improves the representation of MJO precipitation and zonal wind, with RMM predictive skill up to 20 days, whereas the control hindcasts rapidly diverge from observations with no coherent MJO convective signal after 5 days. SP-CAM exhibits superior hindcast performance, with a much more coherent convective envelope. However, a systematic drift in the large-scale fields is found to have a detrimental effect on the interpretation of RMM skill scores.\nAnalysis of the column moist static energy (MSE) budget reveals that the simulations with superior MJO performance exhibit a positive MSE tendency by vertical advection on average, inconsistent with reanalysis that indicates a weak negative tendency. This discrepancy in CAM hindcasts is compensates for overly weak cloud-radiative feedbacks, suggesting that increased entrainment improves the MJO in CAM for the wrong reason. Cloud-radiative feedbacks in SP-CAM show better agreement with observations.\nThe gross moist stability (GMS) is used to interpret these MSE budget results in a normalized framework relevant to moisture mode theory. Both CAM and SPCAM hindcasts are characterized by negative effective GMS, indicating that convection and associated divergent circulations have a net moistening effect on the column, which is a favorable condition to destabilize a moisture mode. However, this result is not consistent with observations.",

            "abstract": "There has been a growing interest by Earth and Planetary Sciences in machine learning, visualization and cyberinfrastructure to interpret ever-increasing volumes of instrument data. Such tools are commonly used to analyze archival datasets, but they can also play a valuable real-time role during missions. Here we discuss ways that machine learning can benefit tactical science decisions during Earth and Planetary Exploration.\nMachine learning’s potential begins at the instrument itself. Smart instruments endowed with pattern recognition can immediately recognize science features of interest. This allows robotic explorers to optimize their limited communications bandwidth, triaging science products and prioritizing the most relevant data. Smart instruments can also target their data collection on the fly, using principles of experimental design to reduce redundancy and generally improve sampling efficiency for time-limited operations. Moreover, smart instruments can respond immediately to transient or unexpected phenomena. Examples include detections of cometary plumes, terrestrial floods, or volcanism. We show recent examples of smart instruments from 2014 tests including: aircraft and spacecraft remote sensing instruments that recognize cloud contamination, field tests of a “smart camera” for robotic surface geology, and adaptive data collection by X-Ray fluorescence spectrometers.\nMachine learning can also assist human operators when tactical decision making is required. Terrestrial scenarios include airborne remote sensing, where the decision to re-fly a transect must be made immediately. Planetary scenarios include deep space encounters or planetary surface exploration, where the number of command cycles is limited and operators make rapid daily decisions about where next to collect measurements. Visualization and modeling can reveal trends, clusters, and outliers in new data. This can help operators recognize instrument artifacts or spot anomalies in real time. We show recent examples from science data pipelines deployed onboard aircraft as well as tactical visualizations for non-image instrument data.",

            "abstract": "As water resources problems typically involve several stakeholders with conflicting objectives, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are now key tools for understanding management tradeoffs. Given the growing complexity of water planning problems, it is important to establish if an algorithm can consistently perform well on a given class of problems. This knowledge allows the decision analyst to focus on eliciting and evaluating appropriate problem formulations. This study proposes a multi-objective adaptation of the classic environmental economics “Lake Problem” as a computationally simple but mathematically challenging MOEA benchmarking problem. The lake problem abstracts a fictional town on a lake which hopes to maximize its economic benefit without degrading the lake’s water quality to a eutrophic (polluted) state through excessive phosphorus loading. The problem poses the challenge of maintaining economic activity while confronting the uncertainty of potentially crossing a nonlinear and potentially irreversible pollution threshold beyond which the lake is eutrophic. Objectives for optimization are maximizing economic benefit from lake pollution, maximizing water quality, maximizing the reliability of remaining below the environmental threshold, and minimizing the probability that the town will have to drastically change pollution policies in any given year. The multi-objective formulation incorporates uncertainty with a stochastic phosphorus inflow abstracting non-point source pollution. We performed comprehensive diagnostics using 6 algorithms: Borg, MOEA\\D, eMOEA, eNSGAII, GDE3, and NSGAII to ascertain their controllability, reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The lake problem abstracts elements of many current water resources and climate related management applications where there is the potential for crossing irreversible, nonlinear thresholds. We show that many modern MOEAs can fail on this test problem, indicating its suitability as a useful and nontrivial benchmarking problem.",

Branches of the visible positive leaders decayed and produced numerous recoil leaders. In one case, the negative end of the recoil leader transitioned to stepping in virgin air and traveled down to the ground initiating a negative cloud-to-ground return stroke. The return stroke traveled back up and out the path formed by the preceding recoil leader and to the tip of the decayed positive leader branch. Luminosity faded in the channel path formed by the recoil-to-stepped leader/ return stroke sequence and numerous other recoil leaders initiated along the same path and traveled to ground initiating subsequent negative return strokes. This flash was captured at 1,000 ips without spectra and at 11,001 ips with spectra. The spectra of the negative end of the recoil leader as it steps downward in virgin air is well resolved. Some of the subsequent dart leaders as well as resulting return strokes are also well resolved with spectra. The return strokes show typical channel cooling from the first frame of the return stroke sequence.",

Here we isolate the role of dynamical ocean processes in the global response to projected Arctic sea ice loss by comparing simulations with a hierarchy of models: atmosphere-only, atmosphere coupled to a slab ocean, and atmosphere coupled to a full-depth dynamical ocean. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to the northern middle and high latitudes. Thermodynamic ocean coupling expands the reach of the response into the tropics, inducing a northward shift of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Including the effects of dynamical ocean coupling results in an equatorward intensification of the Pacific ITCZ, unlike the thermodynamically-coupled response but similar to the greenhouse gas forced response. The results suggest an important role for ocean dynamics in the response of the full climate system to Arctic sea ice loss.",

Although the nature of BrC vertical distributions can significantly influence the radiative forcing impacts, very little data exists on BrC levels throughout the troposphere, in part because aerosol optical instruments can only detect BrC when at significant levels relative to BC. Biomass burning is known to be a substantial source for BrC. Aircraft studies as part of the DC3 and SEAC4RS missions provided a unique opportunity to study wildfire BrC emissions from a variety of sources in different locations and altitudes.

            "abstract": "Because more than 80% of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC) is found below 20 cm depth, deep SOC has the potential to form large positive feedbacks to climate change. According to climate projections, temperature changes at 1 m depth will largely keep pace with warming air temperatures over the next century. While surface SOC decomposes exponentially faster with warming, little is known about the temperature response of deeper carbon, or the modes of stabilization of deeper SOC. Most biogeochemical studies have been limited to the surface soil. Likewise, soil biogeochemical models in Earth System Models are parameterized for surface soil and lack mechanisms important for stabilization of deep SOC, such as organo-mineral associations. Radiocarbon observations in different soil types show that SOC residence of time of SOC increases with depth, with residences times over 10,000 years in many soils by 1 m deep. That means this SOC has accumulated slowly over time; if stabilization mechanisms are disrupted, leading to large changes in decomposition rates, SOC losses are unlikely to be compensated for by increased in plant inputs. Therefore, we suggest that a critical challenge for ESMs is to achieve process-level understanding and the ability to predict whether, and how, the large stores of old SOC can be made rapidly accessible to microbial transformation.",

Similarly, Low-latitude western boundary currents of the Pacific - Mindanao Current and South Equatorial Current also show some bimodal behavior (intrusion or choke) east of the Sulawesi Sea. It is still not well known whether these low frequency variabilities arise from external forcing or internal mechanism. In this paper we explore how temporal variability arises through successive bifurcations of the wind-driven circulation as lateral friction is decreased in a 1.5-layer shallow-water equation models with real continental geometry boundary of the western Pacific. Multiple equilibria of the intrusion of the western boundary currents are found. The origin of these equilibria is investigated by determining the structure of steady solutions by using continuation techniques. In both single-gyre model (analog to the Kuroshio at Luzon Strait)and double-gyre model (analog to the Mindanao Current and South equatorial Current at the source region of the Indonesian Throughflow), the western boundary currents become unstable as the lateral friction decreases. These solutions subsequently destabilize to two sets of barotropic oscillatory modes, introducing an annual and monthly time scale.",

It is not clear how these changes affected export productivity in the Equatorial Pacific (EEP) and what are the potential feedbacks between ocean productivity and climate? To address these questions we use barite accumulation rates to reconstruct export productivity in the eastern equatorial Pacific (ODP Site 849) and compare the record to sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations and other productivity proxies over the past 5.3 Ma. We find that export productivity fluctuated considerably on multiple time scales. During the Pliocene between 4.5 and 3 Ma, export productivity was on average higher (~50 g C m-2 yr-1) than during the Pleistocene (~ 35 g C m-2 yr-1). In the Pleistocene a trend of decreasing export production occurred between 3 Ma and 1 Ma (from ~60 to ~20 g C m-2 yr-1) followed by an increase over the last million years. Our record reveal decoupling between export productivity and SST on long (million year) time scales as previously suggested. Throughout this time interval shorter orbital-scale large amplitude fluctuations (between 10 and 100 g C m-2 yr-1) in export productivity are observed and export production was generally higher during cold periods or during transitions. Results from this study suggest that in the EEP mechanisms that affect carbon export on orbital time scales differed from those operating on longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "Convergence between India and Eurasia has produced the Tibetan Plateau, which stands 5 km high over a region of 3 million km2，since collision at ~50 Ma. A key region for understanding the mechanisms and timing of uplift is the SE margin, where major rivers have incised the plateau margin, permitting the use of thermochronometry to time incision. Here we present new (U-Th)/He ages including 17 ages on apatite and 23 on zircon and 12 apatite fission track ages on the southeastern margins of the Plateau to explore rates and timing of incision. All three thermochronometric systems on the Salween suggest a regional change in the last 8 Myr and exhibit progressive younging over ~ 150 km upstream. Apatite (U-Th)/He ages of valley bottom samples from the Mekong become younger upstream whereas apatite fission-track and zircon (U-Th)/He ages show a large scatter from ~ 5 Ma to ~160 Ma, depending on the distance above the thalweg. Similarly, upstream samples north of 290N on the Yangtze yield much younger ages than downstream samples. Inversion of combined thermochronometers reveals a northward propagation of the highest rates of incision along the Salween and Mekong since 8 Ma. These results, together with analysis of river profiles, are best explained by a scenario of plateau incision that occurred in southeastern Tibet before or coeval at 8 Ma. We infer that the southeastern plateau margin was deformed under a complex context with both lateral expansion of the plateau margin and oblique indenting of the India plate localizing shortening and high uplift rates at the corner of the indenter.",

            "abstract": "The Kalahari encompasses one of the largest drylands in the Southern Hemisphere and it is a potentially large source of atmospheric dust in its relatively low-dust region. The severe iron depletion in the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the ocean basins that receive much of the Kalahari dust, suggests that even incremental increases in dust export to these basins could have significant impact on ocean productivity. The Kalahari also provides an excellent 'natural laboratory', due to its consistent Kalahari Sands existing along a strong precipitation gradient (from ~850 mm in southern Zambia to ~150 mm in southwestern Botswana) with a range of different land uses and land use intensities.\nA large-scale field campaign to evaluate the potential of the southern Kalahari to produce atmospheric dust was established in August, 2013. The goal of the experiment is to evaluate the potential of climate change and land-use to contribute to dust production. The experiment includes measurement of horizontal flux, vegetation structure, and meteorological variables. Novel estimates were made of dust production efficiency (vertical flux produced per unit of horizontal flux) through the coordinated use of active aerosol samplers and passive horizontal sediment traps. In addition, a new stereophotographic method for the estimation of wind-relevant vegetation parameters has been developed for this project.\nOur field data and modeling results indicate that land use and climate can have a significant impact on the potential for dust emission from the region, but new field estimates of dust emission efficiency and chemistry suggest that the absolute magnitude of dust emitted from the region might, at present, be lower than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "The first part of the Lecture deals with the predictive ability of mechanistic models for the Haitian cholera epidemic. Predictive models of epidemic cholera need to resolve at suitable aggregation levels spatial data pertaining to local communities, epidemiological records, hydrologic drivers, waterways, patterns of human mobility and proxies of exposure rates. A formal model comparison framework provides a quantitative assessment of the explanatory and predictive abilities of various model settings with different spatial aggregation levels. Intensive computations and objective model comparisons show that parsimonious spatially explicit models accounting for spatial connections have superior explanatory power than spatially disconnected ones for short-to intermediate calibration windows. In general, spatially connected models show better predictive ability than disconnected ones. We suggest limits and validity of the various approaches and discuss the pathway towards the development of case-specific predictive tools in the context of emergency management.\nThe second part deals with approaches suitable to describe patterns of endemic cholera. Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the 1970s. Here we employ a spatially explicit, inhomogeneous Markov chain model to describe cholera incidence in eight health zones on the shore of lake Kivu. Remotely sensed datasets of chlorophyll a concentration in the lake, precipitation and indices of global climate anomalies are used as environmental drivers in addition to baseline seasonality. The effect of human mobility is also modelled mechanistically. We test several models on a multi-year dataset of reported cholera cases. Fourteen models, accounting for different environmental drivers, are selected in calibration. Among these, the one accounting for seasonality, El Nino Southern Oscillation, precipitation and human mobility outperforms the others in cross-validation.",

            "abstract": "Nearly 50 years have passed since the seminal work of Brace and Byerlee who first suggested that the stick-slip events frequently accompanying frictional sliding in laboratory experiments may be regarded as an experimental analog of shallow earthquakes. Since then numerous studies have investigated physical processes and characteristics of frictional sliding. Extrapolating these laboratory observations to the field scale provide important insights into the physics governing source processes of earthquakes. This can be achieved by a direct near-field in-situ fault observations. In the Earth crust deep mines provide a unique opportunity for this purpose by giving access to the focal depth of earthquakes.\nIn this study we compare the physical and statistical properties of the attoseismicity (MW -8 to -6) recorded in the laboratory experiments on rock samples with nano- and picoseismicity (MW -4 to 0) recorded in-situ after a MW 1.9 earthquake. The microfracturing processes were investigated for the two laboratory stick-slip friction experiments performed on Westerly granite samples with different fault surface roughness (saw-cut fault, fault developed from a fresh fracture). We examined temporal changes of seismic moment tensors, source parameters and b-values of acoustic emission events that occurred during multiple seismic cycles. This study is compared with characteristics of seismicity preceding and following the MW 1.9 earthquake that occurred in Mponeng mine, South Africa. The mainshock was followed by an aftershock sequence composed of more than 25000 nano- and picoearthquakes recorded using high frequency seismic network composed of accelerometers and acoustic emission sensors. Close source-receiver distances (<30m from the hypocenter) allowed to investigate the physical processes occurring in the fault zone before and after the failure in very fine details allowing to form a link between laboratory and in-situ observations.",

Physical environment properties of the model were extracted from a 2005 image implemented in NetLogo. The resulting growth pattern model was compared with empirical growth patterns to ascertain the model’s accuracy. The paper establishes that the development of unplanned structures and its evolving structural pattern are a function of land price, proximity to economic centres, household economic status and location decision-making patterns.

            "abstract": "Mine tailings are typical highly metal contaminated areas with very scarce vegetation. They are affected by intensive rain and wind erosion processes, thus representing a source of environmental and health hazard. Due to their large area and high level of contamination, conventional remediation techniques are not appropriate, and phytostabilization has emerged as an alternative technique during the last decade. The legume plant Anthyllis vulneraria has been identified as a pionner plant to revegetalize mining sites from South of France where an experimental site has been set up for 10 years. Our objective was to clarify the role of Anthyllis vulneraria in the distribution and speciation of Cd and Zn in the soil. For that, we used a combination of micro X-ray fluorescence (µXRF) and micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (µXANES) combined to Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (EXAFS).\nResults showed that the vegetation process had homogeneized the metal distribution in the soil compared to unvegetalized soil, and had decreased the Zn and Cd amount in the surface soil. Undisturbed cross-sections of soils showed that the top of the rhizosphere was highly enriched with organic matter after 10 years of vegetalization. Cd and Zn forms, mainly identified as CdCO3 and ZnCO3 in the unvegetalized soil, did not change significantly in the bulk rhizosphere but investigations at the micrometer scale allowed the identification of Cd and Zn organic phases in the upper part, probably related to the shoots decomposition, and thus to the organic matter recycling. At the close vicinity of the roots, some minor organic metallic forms were found whilst CdCO3 and ZnCO3 minerals were still present, thus highlighting the low direct impact of the roots in the soil. Finally, this study indicated that the direct impact of the plant on Cd and Zn speciation in the soil was weak, while an indirect effect resulting from shoots decomposition could be observed.",

In general, trace element depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts, with low Sr and Pb isotope values (but high εNd and εHf), release mantle-derived noble gases characterised by 3He/4He ~8 ± 1RA, (21Ne/22Ne)ex ~0.06 and 40Ar/36Ar ≥ 10,000 with CO2 and N2 having δ13C~-5‰ and δ15N ~-5‰, respectively. In contrast, enriched intraplate lavas possess higher 3He/4He (up to 50RA), lower (21Ne/22Ne)ex ~0.035 and 40Ar/36Ar ≤ 10,000 with generally higher but variable δ13C and δ15N. These isotopic attributes of mantle-derived volatiles can be exploited to map the extent, and mixing characteristics, of enriched (plume) mantle with depleted asthenospheric mantle ± the effects of over-riding lithosphere and/or crust.\nThe East African Rift System (EARS) is superimposed upon two massive plateaux – the Ethiopia and Kenya domes – regarded as geophysical manifestations of a superplume source, a huge thermochemical anomaly originated at the core-mantle boundary and providing dynamic support for the plateaux. We present new volatile isotopic and relative abundance data (on the same samples) for geothermal fluids (He-CO2-N2), lavas (He-Ne-Ar) and xenoliths (He-Ne-Ar-CO2-N2) which provide an unprecedented overview of the distribution of mantle volatiles of the Ethiopia Dome, from the Red Sea via the Afar region and Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) to the Turkana Depression. Notably, peaks in geothermal fluid 3He/4He (16RA) and δ15N (+6.5‰) are coincident within the MER but the maximum δ13C (-0.78‰) lies ~100 km to the south. Highs in 3He/4He (14RA), δ13C (~-1‰) and δ15N (+3.4‰) for mafic crystals occur in the Afar region ~ 500km to the north. We assess the significance of the off-set in these volatile isotope signals, for sampling volatile heterogeneity in the plume source and/or the relative sensitivity of different volatiles to admixture of plume- with asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle. These results are contrasted with volatile data from the Kenya Dome where the plume signal is muted and the lithospheric mantle exerts a stronger control on geothermal/lava volatile characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Many large rivers are undergoing renewed and increasing anthropogenic-induced change as water diversions, new dams and greater water demands place enhanced stresses on these river basins. Examples of rivers undergoing significant change include the Amazon, Madeira, Nile, Yangtze and Mekong, with considerable ongoing debate raging as to the long-term geomorphic and ecological effects of major anthropogenic interventions. Assessing the effects of such change in large rivers is demanding, one reason being that sediment transport is often exceedingly difficult to measure, and thus data needed to inform the debate on the impact of anthropogenic change is frequently lacking.\nHere, we report on one aspect of research being undertaken as part of STELAR-S2S – Sediment Transfer and Erosion on Large Alluvial Rivers – that is seeking to better understand the relationship between climate, anthropogenic impacts and sediment transport in some of the world’s largest rivers. We are using the Lower Mekong River as our study site, with the Mekong delta being one of only three in the world classified by the IPCC as ‘extremely vulnerable’ to future changes in climate. Herein, we describe details of bedload sediment flux estimation using repeated high-resolution multibeam echo sounder (MBES) bathymetric mapping along the Lower Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers in Cambodia. We are using MBES to quantify the spatial variation in sediment transport both along and also across the river at 11 sites in the study area. Predicted increases in the extraction of sediment from the river through sand dredging are thought likely to cause a significant decrease in downstream sediment flux, and future dam construction along the Mekong main channel potentially offers another source of significant change. These field results will be set in the light of these anthropogenic drivers on sediment flux in the Mekong River and their possible future effects on bar formation and channel migration.",

            "abstract": "Recent climate warming and landscape instability arising from permafrost degradation in the Canadian High Arctic have resulted in significant changes to the hydrological system. We have undertaken an integrated watershed and permafrost research program at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (75°N, 109°W) in paired watershed-lake systems to assess the impact of these changes. Research has captured hydrological changes resulting from exceptional warmth, and permafrost degradation and disturbance.\nResults highlight the contrasting effect of thermal (deeper soil thaw) versus physical perturbation (slope failures and permafrost degradation). Thermal perturbation applies to most of the landscape, and results indicate that ground ice melt alters flow and mobilizes solutes for a number of years following a single warm year. These effects are measureable at the slope-catchment scale, especially during baseflow. By contrast, physical disturbance is highly localized and produces high sediment and particulate carbon erosion from slopes, but downstream particulate delivery is dependent on surface connectivity. Recovery from disturbances appears to occur rapidly, and continued geomorphic change and new slope channels result in sustained delivery of particulates to channels. The result is increased long term landscape heterogeneity with respect to erosion compared to the pre-disturbance condition. Downstream channel response to particulate loading further dampens the response to physical disturbance through channel storage of material. Hence, at the larger watershed scale, the effect of physical perturbation is minimal in the initial years of recovery.\nThese results point to a landscape that has been substantially impacted by recent hydrological and permafrost changes. Understanding and distinguishing these impacts provides a basis for systematically evaluating biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem responses in aquatic settings.",

            "abstract": "In a few decades, managers of Earth's Critical Zones (biota, humans, land, and water) will be challenged to double food and fiber production and diminish adverse effects of management on the wider environment. To meet these challenges, an array of scientific approaches is being used to increase understanding of Critical Zone functioning and evolution, and one amongst these approaches needs to be long-term soil field studies to move us beyond black boxing the belowground Critical Zone, i.e., to further understanding of processes driving changes in the soil environment. Long-term soil experiments (LTSEs) provide direct observations of soil change and functioning across time scales of decades, data critical for biological, biogeochemical, and environmental assessments of sustainability; for predictions of soil fertility, productivity, and soil–environment interactions; and for developing models at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Unfortunately, LTSEs globally are not in a good state, and they take years to mature, are vulnerable to loss, and even today remain to be fully inventoried. Of the 250 LTSEs in a web-based network, results demonstrate that soils and belowground Critical Zones are highly dynamic and responsive to human management. The objective of this study is to review the contemporary state of LTSEs and consider how they contribute to three open questions: (1) can soils sustain a doubling of food production in the coming decades without further impinging on the wider environment, (2) how do soils interact with the global C cycle, and (3) how can soil management establish greater control over nutrient cycling. While LTSEs produce significant data and perspectives for all three questions, there is on-going need and opportunity for reviews of the long-term soil-research base, for establishment of an efficiently run network of LTSEs aimed at sustainability and improving management control over C and nutrient cycling, and for research teams that provide for generation to generation transfer of new and historic LTSEs.",

            "abstract": "Storm events and seasonal “hot moments” can produce sudden changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) - both for bulk concentrations as well as individual DOM constituents. Such episodes can also yield disparate responses for individual DOM moieties which may not be apparent otherwise. Here, we highlight key shifts in stream water DOM in response to episodic events. The study site is an intensively-studied forested watershed (12 ha) located in the Piedmont region of Maryland, USA. DOM has been characterized for stream water and 10 distinct watershed DOM sources over a period of seven years (2008-2014). Stream water sampling was performed for storms using automated ISCO samplers and manual grab samples during baseflow. The composition of DOM was characterized using a variety of UV and fluorescence metrics. Data were also available from an in-stream, high-frequency (15-30 minutes) UV-vis based sensor. Hydrologic flow paths for stream runoff were identified using an end-member mixing model. While small to moderate storms yielded sharp increases in stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and aromatic and humic constituents, a pronounced dilution of DOC was observed for peak flows associated with tropical storms. This dilution pattern did not, however, extend to aromatic and humic DOM constituents suggesting that while rainfall input may outpace DOC supply, the composition and/or sources of DOM may not change. Usually, stormflow also resulted in a decrease in the proportion of protein-like DOM, but a different response was observed for storms following dry, hydrologically-disconnected periods that produced a sharp increase in protein-like DOM. The increase was attributed to the “first-flush” of labile DOM that had mineralized and accumulated in streams over the preceding dry period. Similar pulse increases in protein-like DOM for stream runoff were also observed for a few low-intensity, long-duration storms that occurred early in autumn. This DOM response likely resulted from leaching of DOM from freshly-fallen leaves. Understanding these “hot moments” of DOM provides crucial insights into the leaching kinetics and sensitivity of individual DOM chemical species and can help separate out the various mechanisms that regulate the supply and transport of DOM within watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Sensors and imaging are changing the way we are measuring ecosystem behavior. Within short time frames, we are able to capture how organisms behave in response to rapid change, and detect events that alter composition and shift states. To transform these observations into process-level understanding, we need to efficiently interpret signals. One way to do this is to automatically integrate the data into ecosystem models. In our soil carbon cycling studies, we collect continuous time series for meteorological conditions, soil processes, and automated imagery.\nTo characterize the timing and clarity of change behavior in our data, we adopted signal-processing approaches like coupled wavelet/coherency analyses. In situ CO2 measurements allow us to visualize when root/microbial activity results in CO2 being respired from the soil surface, versus when other chemical/physical phenomena may alter gas pathways. While these approaches are interesting in understanding individual phenomena, they fail to get us beyond the study of individual processes.\nSensor data are compared with the outputs from ecosystem models to detect the patterns in specific phenomena or to revise model parameters or traits. For instance, we measured unexpected levels of soil CO2 in a tropical ecosystem. By examining small-scale ecosystem model parameters, we were able to pinpoint those parameters that needed to be altered to resemble the data outputs. However, we do not capture the essence of large-scale ecosystem shifts.\nThe time is right to utilize real-time data assimilation as an additional forcing of ecosystem models. Continuous, diurnal soil temperature and moisture, along with hourly hyphal or root growth could feed into well-established ecosystem models such as HYDRUS or DayCENT. This approach would provide instantaneous “measurements” of shifting ecosystem processes as they occur, allowing us to identify critical process connections more efficiently.",

            "abstract": "Mineral interaction may affect the stabilisation of plant litter directly or indirectly after microbial decomposition and transformation. The importance of both organic matter sources may vary within the soil profile. This talk will synthesize recent work on the composition of mineral associated material in top- as well as subsoil horizons. We used density fractionation to isolate the mineral-associated fraction and characterised their composition by elemental analyses, NMR spectroscopy, analytical pyrolysis as well as nanoSIMS.\nOur results showed enrichment of mineral associated organic matter in subsoil horizons. However, material derived from new plant litter may be stabilised at similar rates in top- and subsoil horizons. N-containing compounds are enriched in the mineral associated fraction of subsoil horizons, indicating enrichment of microbial derived material with depth. Nano scale analyses showed that indeed plant-derived material may be associated with metal oxides in topsoil horizons, whereas the mineral associated organic matter in subsoil horizons may consist of microbial cells.\nOur results indicate that the nature of OM stabilised by mineral interactions is depth specific. Therefore, we suggest, that plant derived lignocellulosic material may be preserved by mineral interactions in topsoil given its incomplete degradation, thereby leading to the formation of functional groups and favouring adsorption to soil minerals. This is consistent with the higher state of lignin-degradation observed in topsoil horizons as compared to subsoil. At depth, where microorganisms are most likely energy limited, degradation of fresh plant litter may be complete, thereby diminishing the formation of lignocellulosic compounds capable of sorption onto metal oxides. As a result stabilised OM may consist primarily of microbial cells. Thus our study is consistent with the microbial efficiency-matrix stabilisation (MEMS) hypothesis, which says that microbial use efficiency determines stabilisation through interaction with the mineral phase.",

            "abstract": "The Near-Surface is a region of day-to-day human activity on the earth. It is exposed to the natural phenomena which sometimes cause disasters. This presentation covers a broad spectrum of the geotechnical and geohazard ways of mitigating disaster and conserving the natural environment using geophysical methods and emphasizes the contribution of geophysics to such issues. The presentation focusses on the usefulness of geophysical surveys in providing information to mitigate disasters, rather than the theoretical details of a particular technique. Several techniques are introduced at the level of concept and application. Topics include various geohazard and geoenvironmental applications, such as for earthquake disaster mitigation, preventing floods triggered by tremendous rain, for environmental conservation and studying the effect of global warming. Among the geophysical techniques, the active and passive surface wave, refraction and resistivity methods are mainly highlighted. Together with the geophysical techniques, several related issues, such as performance-based design, standardization or regularization, internet access and databases are also discussed. The presentation discusses the application of geophysical methods to engineering investigations from non-uniqueness point of view and introduces the concepts of integrated and quantitative. Most geophysical analyses are essentially non-unique and it is very difficult to obtain unique and reliable engineering solutions from only one geophysical method (Fig. 1). The only practical way to improve the reliability of investigation is the joint use of several geophysical and geotechnical investigation methods, an integrated approach to geophysics. The result of a geophysical method is generally vague, here is a high-velocity layer, it may be bed rock, this low resistivity section may contain clayey soils. Such vague, qualitative and subjective interpretation is not worthwhile on general engineering design works. Engineers need more quantitative information. In order to apply geophysical methods to engineering design works, quantitative interpretation is very important. The presentation introduces several case studies from different countries around the world (Fig. 2) from the integrated and quantitative points of view.",

We list of the questions that Cassini will address in order below.\n(1) Aftermath of a giant storm. Planet-encircling storms occur every 20-30 years. The latest was in 2010-2011. Smaller storms occur every few months. The questions are: How deep are the roots of the storms? What chemicals do they dredge up from below? Do they change the winds in their vicinity? How do storms lead to ammonia depletion and holes in the clouds? What is the depth of the lightning flashes, and is it related to the freezing level of the water cloud? How do storms in the troposphere heat the stratosphere?\n(2) Seasonal and temporal atmospheric change. The 30-year seasonal cycle and the 11-year solar activity cycle are externally driven. In addition, Saturn generates its own 15-year cycle of equatorial winds and temperatures. The questions are: What are the sources and sinks of trace species (water, CO2, acetylene, ethane, diacetylene)? Will the equatorial atmosphere continue to oscillate with a 15-year period? How does Saturn's atmosphere respond to the solar cycle and the solar maximum?\n(3) Polar latitudes are the sites of energetic auroral activity, and they have a giant hexagon-shaped cloud feature and hurricane “eyes” that are centered on the poles. The questions are: What maintains the northern hexagon for more than 30 years? Are hurricane-like features unique to the polar regions? Is the atmosphere \"slipping\" relative to the magnetosphere? What does the aurora tell us about coupling between the magnetic field and atmosphere?\n(4) Saturn’s interior. The interior structure provides information about how the planet formed and evolved. The questions are: What does the gravity field reveal about the winds, composition, and equation of state of the interior? What does the internal magnetic field reveal about planetary dynamos and the internal rate of rotation? Has helium settled toward the center, and how has that affected the planet's thermal evolution? What do we learn from Saturn’s internal oscillations, which have been detected using the rings as a giant seismometer?",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric NO2 columns retrieved from satellite instruments are useful to infer NOx pollution, NOx emissions and atmospheric chemistry. Current satellite products are subject to limitations in assumptions of aerosol optical effects, surface reflectance anisotropy, vertical profiles of NO2, and/or cloud optical properties. Here we develop an improved Peking University Ozone Monitoring Instrument NO2 product (POMINO) for China, complementing the popular DONIMO v2 product.\nPOMINO explicitly accounts for aerosol optical effects, angular dependence of surface reflectance, and dynamically varying atmospheric profiles of air pressure, air temperature and NO2 at a high horizontal resolution (50 km). Prior to the NO2 retrieval, we retrieve cloud top pressure and cloud fraction using consistent assumptions about the states of the atmosphere and surface.\nFor our NO2 and cloud retrievals, we adopt from KNMI (via www.temis.nl) the SCDs of tropospheric NO2 (DOMINO v2) and O2-O2 dimer (OMCLDO2 v1.1.1.3), the TOA reflectance, and some other ancillary information.\nWe develop the AMFv6 code for radiative transfer calculation, based on LIDORT v3.6. Radiative transfer is calculated explicitly for each satellite pixel with no need to use a look-up table. The calculation of AMFv6 is parallelized and is sufficiently fast so that one day of retrieval with global coverage would only take about three hours using 16 CPU cores.\nPOMINO is consistent with MAX-DOAS NO2 data in China, with a R2of 0.96 as compared to the value at 0.72 for DOMINO v2. The improved consistency is related to explicit pixel-by-pixel radiative transfer calculation (instead of using a look-up table), consistent treatments of all parameters in retrieving clouds and NO2, explicit consideration of aerosol optical effects (rather than adjusting ‘effective’ clouds to implicitly account for aerosols), and consideration of surface reflectance anisotropy. Additional analyses are being conducted on the daily, seasonal and interannual variability of NO2 revealed by the POMINO data, as well as impacts on the study of NOx chemistry and emissions.\nOur AMFv6 code is available for public use.

            "abstract": "Urban and suburban streams typically receive anthropogenic nitrogen (N) from multiple sources, and their identification and partitioning is a prerequisite for effective water quality management. However, stream N fluxes and sources are often highly variable, limiting the utility of water samples for source identification. Nitrate in perennial streams can provide an important N source for riparian vegetation in semi-arid environments. Thus, riparian plant tissue may integrate the stable isotope composition (δ15N) of stream nitrate over longer timescales and assist in source identification. Here, we tested whether δ15N of riparian plant leaves could provide an effective indicator of spatial variation in N sources across land use gradients spanning wildland to urban ecosystems in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the surrounding Wasatch Range Megapolitan Area. We found that leaf δ15N varied systematically within and among eight streams and rivers (n = 378 leaf samples) consistent with spatial land use variations. Plants from a suburban stream adjacent to homes with septic systems (δ15N = 5.1‰) were highly enriched relative to similar species from an adjacent undeveloped stream (δ15N = -0.7 ‰), suggesting an important contribution of enriched human fecal N to the suburban stream. Plants from a montane stream in a largely undeveloped recreational canyon that permitted off-leash dogs (δ15N = 1.8 ‰) were enriched relative to an adjacent canyon with similar land use that strictly prohibited dogs but had comparable vehicle traffic (δ15N = -0.7 ‰), suggesting the contribution of dog waste to stream N. Plants from urban stream reaches were enriched by 1.3 – 2.8 ‰ relative to upstream wildland reaches, and δ15N increased by 0.2 ‰ per km in the urban streams. Mechanisms leading to this urban enrichment could include leaky municipal sewers, atmospheric N deposition, and/or increased rates of N cycling and gaseous losses. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential utility of riparian plant N isotopes as a simple diagnostic of N source inputs to inform watershed management.",

            "abstract": "The response of Earth’s major climate systems to natural forcings during the last 2000 years can provide valuable insight into the affect that ongoing climate change may have on these systems. Understanding the relationship between temperature, monsoonal hydroclimate and radiative forcing is of particular interest because hydrologic responses in these systems have the ability to impact over half of the global population. Here, late Holocene variability in the South American and Indian summer monsoon regions is examined using sedimentological, geochemical and isotopic proxies from high altitude lake sediment archives from the Colombian Andes and the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. New results from Laguna de Ubaque, a small moraine dammed lake at 2060 m ASL in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, suggest a reduction in Andean South American summer monsoon (SASM) rainfall during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 900 to 1200 CE) that is consistent with other records from the Andes. During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450 to 1900 CE), Ubaque shows wet conditions between 1450 and 1600 CE and drier conditions from1600 to 1900 CE. This pattern is similar to accumulation at the Quelccaya Ice Cap, but differs from ice core, speleothem and lake sediment oxygen isotope records of synoptic-scale monsoonal precipitation, suggesting that Andean rainfall anomalies may have differed from upstream monsoonal trends over the Amazon. In contrast, results from Badi Namco and Paru Co on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau suggest that the MCA and LIA were relatively minor hydroclimate events superimposed on a larger millennial scale variation in Indian summer monsoon precipitation (1200 to 200 cal yr B.P.) that was associated with changes in the position of the ITCZ, surface air temperature over the Tibetan Plateau and sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific. The unique hydroclimate variations in the ISM and SASM regions supports the idea that while spatially extensive, the MCA and LIA had heterogeneous global expressions and that local factors played an important role in the regional expressions of these events. Analysis of Last Millennium simulations from the CMIP5 ensemble support inferences derived from proxy records and provide further insight into variability in global monsoonal systems.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate records from the Third Pole provide a mixed view of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 800-1000 cal yr B.P.) and Little Ice Age (LIA; 150-550 cal yr B.P.). While some records suggest precipitation increased during the MCA and declined during the LIA, others show little evidence for a coherent hydroclimate response during these events. A better understanding of monsoonal dynamics during events like the MCA and LIA is needed in order to improve constraints on the relationship between temperature and hydroclimate variability, as well as to refine the global expression of the MCA and LIA. Here, decadally resolved physical, geochemical and isotopic lake sediment data from Badi Namco are used to investigate local and synoptic-scale ISM variability on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau during the last 3000 years. Physical and geochemical sediment data, including grain size, lithic flux, bulk density and XRF derived titanium (Ti) are used to characterize local variations in catchment erosion related to ISM rainfall. Synoptic ISM trends are characterized with leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (δDwax) that reflect the isotopic composition of summer precipitation. The Badi Namco results suggest that local ISM rainfall increased above the late Holocene average by 1200 cal yr B.P. and maintained elevated levels to the present, but with a slight decline after 200 cal yr B.P. Leaf wax hydrogen isotopes show a similar trend, but with a later ISM intensification (by 1000 cal yr B.P.) and a shorter event duration; δDwax increased sharply after minimum values at 600 cal yr B.P. These ISM variations inferred from the Badi Namco record share similarities with other local and regional paleoclimate records, including Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions and foraminifera-derived upwelling in Arabian Sea. Together, these relationships suggest that the ISM intensified during the late Holocene after 1200 cal yr B.P. when Indo-Pacific SSTs were elevated. The Badi Namco results also support the idea that the MCA and LIA were relatively minor hydroclimate events on at least the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and that they occurred within the context of a more significant lower frequency climate event.",

The upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar probe Plus missions will vastly extend our knowledge of the inner heliospheric drivers that impact the entire system. However to develop understanding of energy and particle transport that controls the Geospace plasma and radiation envirionment, it is necessary to maintain an accurate monitoring of the plasma and electromagnetic properties of the solar wind near 1 AU. To complete understanding of the Heliosphere we must also extend understanding of energy and plasma transport to regions beyond 1 AU and throughout the Heliosphere. This understanding will complete the connection between the the corona, the 1AU environment and the outer boundaries recently explored by the Voyagers and IBEX. This talk will focus on the linkages between inner heliosphere, the Geospace environment and the outer heliosphere, with an emphasis on what an L1 monitor such as IMAP can provde for the next decade of great discoveries in space physics.",

Statistical study shows that both ion and electron spectra can be used to classify young and mature HFAs. Classifications according to ion and electron spectra are not absolutely consistent, which might be due to different heating mechanisms and efficiency for ions and electrons. HFAs were also classified into four categories (“-+”, “+-”, “M”, and “W”) according their dynamic pressure profile. Most “W” type HFAs are mature HFAs (according to ion spectra) and most “-+” and “+-” type HFAs are young HFAs. Half of the “M” type HFAs are mature HFAs.

            "abstract": "Species-specific responses to changes in precipitation can alter plant community structure and composition potentially altering ecosystem functioning. The latter will further feed back to climate change. Here, we synthesized results from more than 50 experimental studies that either increased or decreased precipitation in grasslands to assess productivity responses of different species and plant functional types (PFT) as well as changes in community structure. Our results showed that increased precipitation enhanced aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of the dominant PFT but had no effect on ANPP of the subordinate species. Similarly, decreased precipitation reduced ANPP of the dominant species but not that of subordinate species. Individual C3 species were highly responsive to alterations in precipitation, but C4 species were not. Altered precipitation had no effect on species richness, evenness or diversity. Overall, ANPP and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) responded to both increased and reduced precipitation, but relative responses of ANPP to increased precipitation diminished with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) whereas the relative responses to reduced precipitation did not change with MAP. BNPP responses to altered precipitation did not vary with MAP. Our findings suggest that the dominant PFT in grasslands can be used as a proxy for community responses in ecosystem biogeochemical models. Further, grassland community composition and structure appear to be relatively stable in response to alterations in precipitation of the duration and magnitude encompassed by these experiments.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes in mid-continents often occur in unexpected places. In North China, large earthquakes roamed between distant fault systems in the past 2000 years such that no large events ruptured the same fault segment twice during this period. In the central-eastern US, although historic earthquake records only go back a few hundred years, increasing paleoseismic evidence reveals large events in places of little seismicity today. Such spatiotemporal patterns of mid-continental earthquakes differ significantly from those at plate boundary zones, where relative plate motion loads the plate boundary faults steadily at relatively high rates, leading to localized seismicity with some arguable quasi-periodicity. In mid-continents, tectonic loading is slow and accommodated collectively by a complex system of interacting faults, each of which can be active for a short period after long dormancy. The mechanics of fault interaction in mid-continents remain to be fully understood. Besides the well studied Coulomb stress perturbations due to dislocation on the fault planes, property changes of fault zones by a large rupture may cause redistribution of regional stress and strain fields in mid-continents. Further studies of fault interaction and the resulting spatiotemporal occurrence of large earthquakes in mid-continents are imperative for improving earthquake hazard assessment in North China, central-eastern US, and other highly populated and earthquake-prone mid-continents.",

            "abstract": "As many as five supercontinents have been proposed and the deep Earth probably holds the key to understand their breakup. The African and Pacific large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) have been stable for the entire Phanerozoic and possibly much longer. Their edges are the dominant source of deep plumes which travel from the base of the mantle to the surface where episodic large igneous province (LIP) activity has punctuated plate tectonics by creating and modifying plate boundaries. Pangea, the best-documented supercontinent, formed at the end of the Carboniferous (320 Ma) by fusing Gondwana and Laurussia. The Panjal Traps (289 Ma) probably assisted in an early Pangea breakup phase (opening of the Neotethys) but the most important phase of breakup started when the Central Atlantic Ocean opened at around 195 Ma. Perhaps not coincidentally, the region where the Atlantic spreading started was preceded by the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (201 Ma), one of the largest LIPs. The Karoo LIP (183 Ma) heralded the Jurassic breakup of Pangea (separation of East and West Gondwana) whereas Paraná-Etendeka LIP activity (134 Ma) preceded South Atlantic break-up by a few million years. The North Atlantic realm experienced prolonged Late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic extension and sedimentary basin formation but the final Early Eocene break-up occurred shortly after a massive episode of volcanism and LIP formation (North Atlantic Igneous Province, 62 Ma) as in most Pangea breakup examples. All LIPs assisting Pangea breakup were sourced by plumes from the margin of the African LLSVP.",

Corals have received considerable attention in this regard; laboratory culture experiments show there to be a wide array of calcification responses to acidification. Here we will show how relationships for the incorporation of various trace elements and boron isotopes into synthetic aragonite can be used to reconstruct carbonate chemistry at the site of calcification. In turn the chemistry at the site of calcification can be determined under different ocean acidification scenarios and differences in the chemistry at the site of calcification linked to different calcification responses to acidification. Importantly we will show that the pH of the calcifying fluid alone is insufficient to estimate calcification responses, thus a multi-proxy approach using multiple trace elements and isotopes is required to understand how the site of calcification is affected by ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "Ancient lakes, with sediment records spanning >1 million years, are very rare. The UNESCO World Heritage site of Lake Ohrid on the Balkans is thought to be the oldest lake in Europe. With 212 endemic species described to date, it is also a hotspot of evolution. In order to unravel the geological and evolutionary history of the lake, an international group of scientists, conducted a deep drilling campaign in spring 2013 under the umbrella of the ICDP SCOPSCO project (Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid).\nOverall, about 2,100 m of sediments were recovered from four drill sites. At the main drill site (DEEP-site) in central parts of the lake where seismic data indicated a maximum sediment fill of ca. 700 m, a total of more than 1,500 m of sediments were recovered until a penetration depth of 569 m. Currently, core opening, core description, XRF and MSCL scanning, sub-sampling (16 cm resolution), and inorganic and organic geochemical as well as sedimentological analyses of the sediment cores from the DEEP site are in progress at the University of Cologne. Previous studies at Lake Ohrid have shown that interglacial periods are characterized by high TIC and TOC contents, likely associated with high contents of calcite and organic matter in the sediments. In contrast, during glacial periods negligible TIC and low TOC contents correspond to high K counts indicating enhanced supply of clastic material. Similar patterns can be observed in the biogeochemical analyses of the subsamples and in the XRF data of the DEEP site record. Following these variations on a glacial-interglacial time scale, TIC and TOC data obtained from the subsamples and from core catcher samples indicate that the DEEP site sequence provides a 1.2 million year old continuous record of environmental and climatological variability in the Balkan Region. The age control can be further improved by first findings of macroscopic tephra horizons. Peaks in K, Sr, Zr, and magnetic susceptibility might indicate the occurrence of additional cryptotephra layers in the sediment sequence.",

            "abstract": "The injection of HCl into the stratosphere by large volcanic eruptions is considered to be little importance, due to the efficient incorporation of the former into hydrometeors within the cooling plume. However, HCl is also adsorbed onto ash surfaces to form soluble –Cl salts within the high temperature core of the eruption plume, and the atmospheric and environmental significance of this process is uncertain. We investigate the capacity of volcanic glasses with tephrite, phonolite, dacite, and rhyolite compositions to adsorb HCl at temperatures of 200-800°C in the presence of SO2, CO2 and He. Experiments show that only tephrite and phonolite glasses are significantly reactive to HCl, exhibiting optimal uptake at 400-600°C. The primary reaction product formed during adsorption is NaCl, but Ca-, K-, Al- and Fe- chlorides are also identified. Uptake of HCl by glass surfaces is sustained by interdiffusion of Na+ and other Cl-reactive cations with H+. Diffusion coefficient calculations yield Na diffusion coefficients for the four glasses, suggesting that the structural role for Na within the glass network governs the capacity for HCl retention. The uptake of HCl under experimental conditions is limited above 500°C by a Cl-induced dehydroxylation process, but the presence of H2O in the hydrous eruption plume may sustain or enhance adsorption. The experimental data, combined with simulated plume cooling profiles, suggest that HCl adsorption can be a significant scavenging mechanism in large explosive eruptions, particularly in peralkaline systems. The fate of adsorbed HCl is variable; some may be retained on ash surfaces within pyroclastic flows, while chloride-coated ash in the stratosphere could promote the formation of reactive Cl species associated with O3 destruction. Additionally, Fe- and Cl-bearing salts emplaced on ash surfaces by HCl adsorption within the plume cores of large explosive eruptions may increase the ocean fertilising potential of such events.",

            "abstract": "Early infrared observations of the Martian surface have revealed the presence of a deep absorption between 2.6 and 3.5 µm usually referred to as the 3-µm band. Two non-exclusive explanations have been formulated to account for this 3-µm band. The first possibility is that it relates to the presence of some amount of adsorbed atmospheric water, water that would be exchangeable and could play a role in present day Mars water cycle. The alternative is that this absorption is due to an –OH or H2O bearing mineral component within the Martian dust, which would imply that water is involved at some stage of the dust production mechanism. Several lines of evidences seem to converge toward the second hypothesis.\nFirst, after 10 years of mapping of the martian surface with OMEGA (MEX), the lack of variation of the 3-µm feature with surface relative humidity suggests that the surface hydration does not exchange with the atmosphere. This is in agreement with laboratory adsorption experiments under Mars conditions.\nMore recently the Mars Science Laboratory with unprecedented payload has provided some crucial constraints on the nature of surface hydration. The ChemCam instrument onboard MSL has detected hydrogen in dust and soil, and revealed the lack of variation of H concentration with surface humidity, including nighttime measurements. Also, evolved gas analysis by SAM of Gale crater soils shows that water is released at relatively high-temperature and suggest that –OH or H2O bearing phases are trapped in the amorphous component of soils.\nFinally, the exceptional “black beauty” meteorite might also provide clues to the nature of Mars’s surface hydration. This Martian breccia shows elevated amount of water with respect to any other Martian meteorite. By studying the spectral properties of NWA 7533, we were able to show the presence of a 3-µm band and a small red-slope; this Martian breccia seems to contain a fine-oxidized-H-bearing component, possibly similar to that present in the Martian dust.",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS) is the largest low-latitude marginal sea in the world. Its formation and evolution are linked to the complex continental-oceanic tectonic interaction of the Eurasian, Pacific, and Indo-Australian plates. Despite its relatively small size and short history, the SCS has undergone nearly a complete Wilson cycle from continental break-up to seafloor spreading to subduction. In January-March 2014, Expedition 349 of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) drilled five sites in the deep basin of the SCS. Three sites (U1431, U1433, and U1434) cored into oceanic basement near the fossil spreading center on the East and Southwest Subbasins, whereas Sites U1432 and U1435 are located near the northern continent/ocean boundary of the East Subbasin. Shipboard biostratigraphy based on microfossils preserved in sediment directly above or within basement suggests that the preliminary cessation age of spreading in both the East and Southwest Subbasins is around early Miocene (16–20 Ma); however, post-cruise radiometric dating is being conducted to directly date the basement basalt in these subbasins. Prior to the IODP drilling, high-resolution near-seafloor magnetic surveys were conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the SCS with survey lines passing near the five IODP drilling sites. The deep-tow surveys revealed detailed patterns of the SCS magnetic anomalies with amplitude and spatial resolutions several times better than that of traditional sea surface measurements. Preliminary results reveal several episodes of magnetic reversal events that were not recognized by sea surface measurements. Together the IODP drilling and deep-tow magnetic surveys provide critical constraints for investigating the processes of seafloor spreading in the SCS and evolution of a mid-ocean ridge from active spreading to termination.",

Specifically, we will present measurements on (Mg,Fe)O and bridgmanite-structured (Mg,Fe)SiO3 with their relevance to ultra-low velocity zones and large piles in the core-mantle boundary region. The nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering method provides specific vibrational information and in combination with x-ray diffraction data permits the determination of sound velocities and thermodynamic parameters. The nuclear resonant forward scattering method, also called synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy, provides hyperfine interactions between the resonant nucleus and electronic environment like isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings, which provide information on valence and spin states. These methods are complementary in terms of providing important information necessary to understand Earth’s interior. For example, accurate determination of the sound velocities and equations of state of deep Earth materials combined with seismic observations and dynamic modeling is essential for understanding the radial and lateral distributions of minerals. Also, knowledge of iron valences and spin states of minerals are relevant to our understanding of transport properties, mechanical behavior, and element partitioning, all of which control Earth’s internal dynamics.",

While PACA identifies a consistent collaborative approach to pro-am collaborations, given the volume of data generated for each campaign, new ways of rapid data analysis, mining access and storage are needed. Several interesting results emerged from the synergistic inclusion of both social media and amateur astronomers:\n(1) the establishment of a network of astronomers and related professionals, that can be galvanized into action on short notice to support observing campaigns;\n(2) assist in various science investigations pertinent to the campaign;\n(3) provide an alert-sounding mechanism should the need arise;\n(4) immediate outreach and dissemination of results via our media/blogger members;\n(5) provide a forum for discussions between the imagers and modelers to help strategize the observing campaign for maximum benefit.\nIn 2014, two new comet observing campaigns involving pro-am collaborations have been initiated: (1) C/2013 A1 (C/SidingSpring) and (2) 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG), target for ESA/Rosetta mission. The evolving need for individual customized observing campaigns has been incorporated into the evolution of PACA portal that currently is focused on comets: from supporting observing campaigns of current comets, legacy data, historical comets; interconnected with social media and a set of shareable documents addressing observational strategies; consistent standards for data; data access, use, and storage, to align with the needs of professional observers. The integration of science, observations by professional and amateur astronomers, and various social media provides a dynamic and evolving collaborative partnership between professional and amateur astronomers. The empowerment of amateur astronomers vis-à-vis their partnerships with the professional scientists creates a new demographic of data scientists, enabling citizen science of the integrated data from both the professional and amateur communities.",

            "abstract": "Xenoliths and xenocrysts present in petit spot lavas can provide information on the nature and processes occurring in the oceanic lithosphere. Petit spot volcanoes represent small-scale seamounts formed by the extraction of low-degree melts from the base of the lithosphere in response to plate flexure and/or crack propagation. Here, we report the discovery of a garnet xenocryst present in a petit spot sample from east of Japan. The xenocryst is pyrope-rich (Py60, Gr20, Al16), has low Cr and Ti contents, depleted LREE, a slight positive Eu anomaly and flat HREE with primitive mantle normalized values of around one.\nThe presence of garnet in the oceanic lithosphere could originate from gt-peridotite but such garnet should have higher Mg# and Cr content than observed in our sample. Garnet in oceanic lithosphere could also be linked to the presence of gt-pyroxenite. Mantle pyroxenite xenoliths are frequently interpreted as subducted oceanic crust (eclogite). Although we cannot exclude this hypothesis, the presence of eclogite in the Pacific oceanic lithosphere would require long tramsport time without melting at the mid-oceanic ridge. In addition, the pyrope content of the xenocryst is relatively high and the HREE are low compared to garnet from typical eclogites.\nGt-pyroxenite could also form by direct crystallization from a melt percolating through the lithosphere. However, the REE pattern of the garnet xenocryst excludes direct crystallization from a basaltic melt. We hypothesize, in order to explain the major and trace element composition of this garnet, that it is formed by subsolidus reaction of ol-pl-cpx cumulates during the cooling of the lithosphere at constant pressure (~1-1.5 GPa). This cumulate is interpreted to have formed during the percolation and differentiation of basaltic melts in the periphery of a mid-oceanic ridge. The presence of this garnet xenocryst supports the hypothesis that oceanic lithosphere is re-enriched by metasomatic processes.",

            "abstract": "Recent numerical modeling studies of the time-dependent development of texture and seismic anisotropy during subduction have shed light on how the mantle deforms as a slab subducts. It is thus becoming more and more clear that the term “mantle flow” may be too ambiguous in the context of subduction. For instance, it has been suggested that trench-parallel shear wave splitting fast directions (from SKS and source-side S splitting) on the seaward side need not necessarily be the result of trench-parallel movement (i.e., “flow”) of mantle material, but are rather due to pure shear deformation in the sub-slab mantle. Here we present results of a numerical modeling study where we have systematically investigated how mantle propagation, finite strain, olivine lattice-preferred orientation (LPO), and SKS splitting vary with slab width in a fully dynamic 3-D subduction model. We find that even in the complex circum-slab flow field, the finite strain ellipsoid (FSE) is a good proxy for LPO. However, it does not necessarily align with the instantaneous mantle flow velocity vector. We identify two distinct domains with different deformation types in the central sub-slab upper mantle: simple shear induced by plate advance dominates at shallow depths and results in trench-normal fast splitting, while pure shear due to slab rollback dominates in the deeper mantle (above 410 km) and produces trench-parallel fast orientations. In our models, the SKS splitting pattern strongly depends on these two competing effects as well as the subduction partition ratio, γ = Xp/Xt, where Xp and Xt are the lengths of plate advance and trench retreat, respectively. If γ < 1 (narrow slabs, < 1000 km), trench-parallel fast directions are produced. In contrast, γ > 1 (wide slabs, > 1000 km), results in trench-normal fast splitting. This may explain the observed dichotomy in natural subduction zones of sub-slab fast splitting patterns (away from slab edges) usually being either trench-parallel or –perpendicular.",

            "abstract": "Both satellite and ground-based observations have indicated that there are systematic differences between the polar regions of the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH) thermosphere and ionosphere. At an altitude of ~400 km, cross-polar neutral wind and ion drift speeds are generally larger in the NH than in the SH, while the spatial variance of the neutral wind is larger in the SH. The magnitude of these North-South differences depends on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), and probably also on the season and solar activity level. We use simulations with the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere model to explore the causes of the observed North-South differences. At least part of the differences can be explained by the asymmetry of the Earth’s magnetic field. First, the magnetic flux density in the NH polar region is lower than in the SH. Since ion drift speeds scale as E/B, this result in stronger ion drifts in the NH, and also stronger neutral winds due to ion drag. Second, the offset between the invariant magnetic pole and the geographic pole is smaller in the NH than the SH. Model simulations indicate that a smaller offset should also contribute to stronger ion drifts and neutral winds. In addition, it could explain the greater spatial variance in the neutral wind in the SH. The dependencies of inter-hemispheric differences on season and solar activity level are only in part reproduced by the model. Further work is still needed to understand these dependencies fully.",

            "abstract": "Flattening of the subducting plate has been linked to the formation of various geological features, including basement-cored uplifts, the cessation of arc volcanism, ignimbrite flare-ups, and the formation of high plateaus and ore deposits [Humphreys et al., 2003; Gutscher et al., 2000; Rosenbaum et al., 2005]. However, the mechanism responsible for the slab flattening is still poorly understood. Here we focus on the Peruvian flat slab, where the Nazca plate starts to bend at ~80 km depth and travels horizontally for several hundred kilometers, at which point steep subduction resumes. Based on a 1500 km long volcanic gap and intermediate depth seismicity patterns, the Peruvian flat slab appears to have the greatest along-strike extent and, therefore, has been suggested as a modern analogue to the putative flat slab during the Laramide orogeny in the western United States (~80-55 Ma). Combining 3D shear wave velocity structure and Rayleigh wave phase anisotropy between ~10° and 18° S, we find that the subducting Nazca plate is not uniformly flat along the entire region, but fails to the north of the subducting Nazca Ridge. Our results show that, in combination with trench retreat, rapid overriding plate motion, and/or presence of a thick cratonic root, the subduction of buoyant overthickened oceanic crust, such as the Nazca Ridge, is necessary for the formation and sustainability of flat slabs. This finding has important implications for the formation of flat slabs both past and present.",

            "abstract": "Global climate changes have been evidenced in various ways since the start of paleoclimatology in the 70s. The access to past atmosphere conditions in the air bubbles trapped in ice-cores gave an important impulse as it made the green-house gases concentrations accessible a prerequisite for climate modelers. Indeed since the publication of CO2 and CH4 variations over the last climate cycle in Vostok ice-cores, our knowledge of the past climate conditions has improved tremendously. However, improvements in technical equipment and approaches indicate that more is still to come inducing expected new findings in terms of mechanisms. The IMAGES program yielded very good quality and long marine cores that permitted to compare marine and ice-core records with high confidence. Moreover they permitted to improve the knowledge of past oceans dynamics, especially those linked to the massive discharges of icebergs in the oceans, impacting the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. On the continent, various environments are drilled and cored to provide also comparable and reliable records of past climate: lakes, peatbogs, speleothems and loess. These records are complementary yielding important dataset to feed the earth system models necessary for a better understanding of past climate dynamics.\nTechnical limitation of the present equipments does not allow such important jump in the quality of the data, and therefore in the knowledge of i, past climate variations at extremely high resolution and ii, of the behavior of the different domains as studied in IPCC experiments while societal requirements are more and more expressed by policy makers. C2FN initiative at CNRS gathers the present coring equipments located in labs or at the technical division of INSU, and coordinates the different efforts provided by the concerned communities (ocean, ice and continent). Valorization of the results obtained are published in high ranked scientific journals and presented in scientific meetings. Moreover the technological improvements and developments in coring activities are likely to result in patent applications that the DT INSU realizes in the framework of its activities and duties. CLIMCOR project intends to provide the French scientific community, the top-level technological support.",

These extremes will directly affect the availability and reliability of water and other critical resources. The most comprehensive suite of multi-model projections has been assembled under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) and assessed in the Fifth Assessment (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In order for these projections to be actionable, the projections should exhibit consistency and fidelity down to the local length and timescales required for operational resource planning, for example the scales relevant for water allocations from a major watershed.\nIn this presentation, we summarize the length and timescales relevant for resource planning and then use downscaled versions of the IPCC simulations over the contiguous United States to address three questions. First, over what range of scales is there quantitative agreement between the simulated historical extremes and in situ measurements? Second, does this range of scales in the historical and future simulations overlap with the scales relevant for resource management and adaptation? Third, does downscaling enhance the degree of multi-model consistency at scales smaller than the typical global model resolution? We conclude by using these results to highlight requirements for further model development to make the next generation of models more useful for planning purposes.",

            "abstract": "Changes in global mean sea level (GMSL) are a sensitive indicator of climate variability during the current ice age. Reconstructions are largely based on local sea level records, and the mapping to GMSL is computed from simulations of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) on 1-D Earth models. We argue, using two case studies, that resolving important, outstanding issues in ice age paleoclimate requires a more sophisticated consideration of mantle structure and dynamics.\nFirst, we consider the coral record from Barbados, which is widely used to constrain global ice volume changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21 ka). Analyses of the record using 1-D viscoelastic Earth models have estimated a GMSL change since LGM of ~120 m, a value at odds with analyses of other far field records, which range from 130-135 m. We revisit the Barbados case using a GIA model that includes laterally varying Earth structure (Austermann et al., Nature Geo., 2013) and demonstrate that neglecting this structure, in particular the high-viscosity slab in the mantle linked to the subduction of the South American plate, has biased (low) previous estimates of GMSL change since LGM by ~10 m. Our analysis brings the Barbados estimate into accord with studies from other far-field sites.\nSecond, we revisit estimates of GMSL during the mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP, ~3 Ma), which was characterized by temperatures 2-3°C higher than present. The ice volume deficit during this period is a source of contention, with estimates ranging from 0-40 m GMSL equivalent. We argue that refining estimates of ice volume during MPWP requires a correction for mantle flow induced dynamic topography (DT; Rowley et al., Science, 2013), a signal neglected in previous studies of ice age sea level change. We present estimates of GIA- and DT-corrected elevations of MPWP shorelines from the U.S. east coast, Australia and South Africa in an attempt to reconcile these records with a single GMSL value.",

            "abstract": "As carbon solubility is low in basalts, MORB contain little dissolved CO2 (189±61 ppm, 1σ, n=600 [1]). A global negative correlation between CO2/Nb (proxy for amount of CO2 lost by degassing) and Ba/La (proxy for source enrichment) indicates that depleted MORB are less affected by degassing than enriched MORB: CO2/Nb ratios range from 0-100 for samples with Ba/La>4, while CO2/Nb range from 50 to 400 for samples with Ba/La<4 [1]. To assess the CO2 content of undegassed MORB, we analyzed the volatile content of 70 olivine-hosted, glassy melt inclusions (MIs) from four basalts dredged along MAR 1-5°S, a ridge segment that produces highly depleted MORB in terms of trace element enrichment and radiogenic isotopes [2, 3]. MIs contain CO2 contents (180-1420 ppm) that are higher than their respective matrix glasses (130-220 ppm, typical for vapor-saturated melts erupted at 3-5 km b.s.l.).\nOne of the four dredges (EN061 5D-3Ag) contains MIs that do not exhibit shrinkage bubbles. For this sample only, we find a positive correlation between the CO2 content (240-770 ppm) and the Cl content (6-20 ppm) of the MIs that is not found in the matrix glasses (see Fig.). We infer that the correlation between CO2 and Cl, both highly incompatible in silicate minerals during fractional crystallization, is strong evidence for vapor-undersaturation, as any CO2 degassing would have erased the correlation. Together with MIs from the Siqueiros Fracture Zone [4] and from northern Iceland [5], the MIs from EN061 5D-3Ag may represent another occurrence of carbon-undersaturated MORB. Our results will be used to model the primary carbon content of MORB and of the depleted upper mantle. Note that the average Cl content of the matrix glasses (20±1 ppm) is higher than those of the MIs (12±3 ppm, see Fig.). This indicates either that the matrix glasses assimilated a small amount of seawater Cl, or that the MIs are all more depleted than the matrix glass. We will acquire major and trace element data in order to further investigate the origin of the low Cl and high CO2 contents in these MIs.\nRef. [1] Le Voyer et al. 2014 Goldschmidt abstr.

            "abstract": "Flexible plants bend in response to fluid motion and this reconfiguration mechanism allows plants to minimize the increase of drag force with increasing velocity, ensuring survival in flow-dominated habitats. The effect of reconfiguration on the flow field can be modeled by introducing a drag coefficient that decreases with increasing velocity. Typically, a power-law decrease of the drag coefficient with increasing velocity is used, and the negative exponent is known as the Vogel number. In practice, the Vogel number is a function of canopy rigidity and flow conditions. In this work we show that accounting for the effect of reconfiguration is required for large-eddy simulation (LES) models to reproduce the skewness of the streamwise and vertical velocity components and the distribution of sweeps and ejections observed in a large cornfield. Additional LES runs are conducted to investigate the structure of turbulence in different reconfiguration regimes, with mean vertical momentum flux constrained by measurements. The change of the Vogel number has negligible effects on LES predictions of the total vertical momentum flux and the components of turbulent kinetic energy, but produces profound changes in the mechanisms of momentum transport. This work demonstrates the necessity to model the effect of reconfiguration in LES studies of canopy flows. It also highlights the impacts of reconfiguration on the structure of turbulence and the dynamics of momentum fluxes, as well as any other process that depends on velocity fluctuations above and within the canopy region.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic time series are the superimposition of a number of geophysical signals, errors, and noise. The objective of sources separation is to isolate and to identify each contribution. Indeed, when using geodetic data to study mass redistributions within the Earth system and the dynamics their reflect, it is a crucial step to separate the different geophysical signals in the time series.\nSources separation techniques generally estimate a separation matrix, which depends on assumptions on the nature of the sources. Here, several sources separation techniques were tested : PCA (Principal Component Analysis), rotated PCA, and two methods of ICA (Independant Component Analysis). PCA assumes that the sources are linearly independent, whereas ICA searches for sources that are statistically independent. Among the ICA techniques, different methods can be used to ensure this statistical independence. We tested two of them: non-gaussianity of the sources and minimization of the mutual information. First, we tested the adequacy between the hypothesis on the sources involved in each kind of separation technique, and the nature of and characteristics of these sources. Then, we built from these a priori sources synthetic geodetic time series and we tested the performances of each separation technique to retrieve the original sources. Results show great differences between the results obtained with the different separation techniques. In particular, if periodic signals are well retrieved by all separation techniques, PCA gives better results in order to retrieve interannual climatic signals and ICA performs better for some specific a priori sources like co-seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "On May 1, 1958 in the Great Hall of the US National Academy of Sciences, James A. Van Allen, having instrumented Explorer-1 and follow-on satellites with radiation detectors, announced the discovery of intense radiation at high altitudes above Earth. The press dubbed the doughnut-shaped structures “Van Allen Belts” (VAB). Soon thereafter, the search began for VAB at nearby planets. Mariner 2 flew by Venus in 1962 at a distance of 41,000 km, but no radiation was detected. The Mariner 4 mission to Mars did not observe planet-associated increase in radiation, but scaling arguments with Earth’s magnetosphere yielded an upper limit to the ratio of magnetic moments of MM/ME < 0.001 (Van Allen et al, 1965). Similarly, the Mariner 5 flyby closer to Venus resulted in a ratio of magnetic moments < 0.001 (Van Allen et al, 1967), dealing a blow to the expectation that all planetary bodies must possess significant VAB. The flyby of Mercury in 1974 by Mariner 10 revealed a weak magnetic field, but the presence of durably trapped higher energy particles remained controversial until MESSENGER in 2011.The first flybys of Jupiter by Pioneers 10, 11 in 1973 and 1974, respectively, measured a plethora of energetic particles in Jupiter’s magnetosphere and established the fact that their intensities were rotationally modulated. Later flybys of Jupiter and Saturn by the two Voyagers in 1979 and 1981 revealed that those magnetospheres possessed their own internal plasma source(s) and radiation belts. Subsequent discoveries of Van Allen belts at Uranus and Neptune by Voyager 2 demonstrated that VAB are the rule rather than the exception in planetary environments. We now know from the Voyagers and through Energetic Neutral Atom images from Cassini and IBEX that an immense energetic particle population surrounds the heliosphere itself. Thus, the reconnaissance of radiation belts of our solar system has been completed, some 56 years after the discovery of the Van Allen Belts at Earth.",

            "abstract": "Cloud parameterizations in climate models include a number of adjustable parameters that arise from uncertainties in cloud processes. These parameters are often tuned to best reproduce specific aspects of the observed climate, such as the energy balance at the top of the atmosphere. Starting with the CMIP5 GFDL CM3 coupled climate model, we construct alternate model configurations that achieve the desired energy balance using different, but plausible, combinations of parameters. The present-day climate is nearly indistinguishable in all configurations, but the evolution of the surface temperature from pre-industrial to present-day differs markedly among these configurations due to a large spread in the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect. Details of the cloud-to-rain conversion processes are found to be the source for this large spread.\nRecently developed methodologies to analyze the CloudSat and A-Train satellite observations are employed to construct the statistical “fingerprint” process-level signatures of the cloud-to-rain processes. These methodologies are applied to both satellite observations and climate models. Such comparisons can be used to help constrain uncertain parameters included in cloud parameterizations. One of the highlighted results demonstrates that the model predictability of twentieth-century historical temperature trends contradicts the process-based constraint on a tunable cloud parameter. This implies the presence of compensating errors at a fundamental level, and underscores the importance of observation-based, process-level constraints on model microphysics uncertainties for more reliable predictions of the aerosol indirect effect. This uncertainty in the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect ultimately limits our ability to constrain the climate sensitivity.",

(1993) taking advantage of more recent geological constraints from ODP Leg 158 drill holes across the hydrothermal mounds and high-resolution bathymetry. The dipolar magnetic anomaly associated with the site is better reduced to the pole assuming an inclination of 10° (instead of 44° expected at 26°N) for the magnetization vector. Such an observation suggests that basalt surrounding the site, which belongs to a strongly \"faulted and fissured zone\" (FFZ), has been rotated by ~53° along a N30°E horizontal axis (parallel to the MAR axis in this area) as a probable consequence of the detachment tectonics inferred in this area. The FFZ faults, together with the deeper detachment, focus and guide the hot ascending hydrothermal fluid. Magnetic forward modeling of the site shows that, although insufficient to explain the whole observed negative anomaly, the hydrothermal material - and more specifically the stockwork zone - is a significant cause of missing magnetization that contributes to about a third of the observed anomaly. The rest of the anomaly is accounted for by a deeper source possibly related to thermal demagnetization of an ascending hydrothermal pipe beneath the active part of the site. The significant contribution of the stockwork zone to the magnetic signature of TAG confirms that it is a common character of all type of hydrothermal sites, of potential interest for deep-sea mineral exploration.\nTivey, M.A., Rona, P.A., and Schouten H., 1993, Reduced crustal magnetization beneath the active mound, TAG hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, at 26°N: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 115, p. 101-115, doi:10.1016/0012-821X(93)90216-V.",

            "abstract": "A better understanding of tropical weather processes is necessary to improve numerical weather models, which are not fully satisfactory in tropical regions. Water vapor plays a key role in humid atmospheric processes and precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a widely employed quantity to study these processes and compute water budgets. PWV can be retrieved with an accuracy of about 1-2 kg.m-2from the zenithal wet delays (ZWD) estimated during GPS data processing. In that perspective, six permanent GPS stations were deployed in West Africa within the framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project.\nThe current quality level of PWV could be reached thanks to successive improvements of the mapping functions used (NMF → GMF → VMF1) and of the a priori ZHD retrieved from meteorological models. However, standard GPS data processing does still not optimally take into account the climatic variability across stations and time: the stochastic constraints used for ZWD estimation are generally the same regardless of the station and of its local weather. This non-optimal modelling of GPS data affects the accuracy of GPS-derived PWV and is therefore one limiting factor for weather and climate studies. The purpose of this study is to quantify the influence of the stochastic constraints in the tropospheric model on ZWD and PWV estimates for tropical GPS stations. Possible improvements are suggested.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the terrestrial oceans and atmosphere is still a matter of intensive debate. For a while high D/H ratios in comets compared to both meteorites and Earth’s oceans (which share approximately the same range of values) has been taken as evidence for an asteroidal origin of the oceans. This possibility is in line with the N isotope composition of meteorites encompassing the terrestrial atmosphere value. Recently, Earth-like D/H ratios have been reported for two comets, thus re-vitalizing the possibility of cometary contribution to terrestrial volatiles. Nitrogen in cometary CN, HCN, and NH2 (the N-bearing molecules that can be analyzed remotely) is enriched by a factor of approx. 80% in 15N compared to terrestrial N. The question is whether or not these N-bearing molecules are representative of bulk N in comets. If nitrogen is trapped as N2 in cometary ices, its isotope composition could reflect that of the protosolar nebula, which was depleted by 40% relative to Earth. A cometary cocktail consisting of 1/3 reduced, 15N-rich N and 2/3 of nebula-like N2 would make the terrestrial N isotope composition. Another strong constraint will arise from the analysis of cometary noble gases which, if trapped at sufficiently low temperature in ice, could account for the elevated noble gas/H,C ratio of the terrestrial surface reservoirs. Hopefully, the ROSINA instrument on board of the Rosetta spacecraft which will analyze volatile elements degassed by comet 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which should permit to shed light on this fundamental issue.",

            "abstract": "Threshold concepts in any discipline are the core concepts an individual must understand in order to master a discipline. By their very nature, these concepts are troublesome, irreversible, integrative, bounded, discursive, and reconstitutive. Although grasping threshold concepts can be extremely challenging for each learner as s/he moves through stages of cognitive development relative to a given discipline, the learner’s grasp of these concepts determines the extent to which s/he is prepared to work competently and creatively within the field itself. The movement of individuals from a state of ignorance of these core concepts to one of mastery occurs not along a linear path but in iterative cycles of knowledge creation and adjustment in liminal spaces – conceptual spaces through which learners move from the vaguest awareness of concepts to mastery, accompanied by understanding of their relevance, connectivity, and usefulness relative to questions and constructs in a given discipline. With the explosive growth of data available in atmospheric science, driven largely by satellite Earth observations and high-resolution numerical simulations, paradigms such as that of data-intensive science have emerged. These paradigm shifts are based on the growing realization that current infrastructure, tools and processes will not allow us to analyze and fully utilize the complex and voluminous data that is being gathered. In this emerging paradigm, the scientific discovery process is driven by knowledge extracted from large volumes of data. In this presentation, we contend that this paradigm naturally lends to inquiry-driven pedagogy where knowledge is discovered through inductive engagement with large volumes of data rather than reached through traditional, deductive, hypothesis-driven analyses. In particular, data-intensive techniques married with an inductive methodology allow for exploration on a scale that is not possible in the traditional classroom with its typical problem sets and static, limited data samples. In addition, we identify existing gaps and possible solutions for addressing the infrastructure and tools as well as a pedagogical framework through which to implement this inductive approach.",

            "abstract": "Renalysis data suggests that nearly 20% of the atmospheric moisture over the La Plata basin comes from Amazonian Evapotranspiration (ET). However, these estimates of ET are model dependent. Simulations using land-surface models (LSMs) in off-line mode (i.e. with prescribed atmospheric forcing) have shown that Amazonian ET depends on the groundwater dynamics. In this study we use the NoahMP LSM in off-line mode and the coupled system WRF-NoahMP to assess the role of groundwater on South American ET. In particular, we study the role of the groundwater in sustaining ET during the dry season in the southern Amazon and the La Plata basin. We compare simulations that do not account for the groundwater reservoir (free drainage approach) with simulations that include the Miguez-Macho and Fan parameterization to represent the groundwater storage, its lateral flow, and its interaction with the unsaturated zone. The off-line simulations show the effects associated solely with groundwater dynamics (as opposed to coupled land-atmosphere processes), while the coupled simulations provide information about the regulation and/or response from the atmosphere. Preliminary results from the coupled system suggest that the largest effects of the groundwater on ET are observed during the austral dry season. ET is larger over regions of Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina when groundwater is included, due to the existence of a relatively shallow water table over these regions, which via upward capillary fluxes reduces drainage during the rainy season and increases soil moisture availability in the dry season. These differences in the simulated ET could have an impact on the estimates of the transport of atmospheric moisture to La Plata basin.",

            "abstract": "The Coupling of three model components, WRF/PCE (polar climate extension version of weather research and forecasting model (WRF)), ROMS (regional ocean modeling system), and CICE (community ice code), has been implemented, and the regional atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model named WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE has been validated against ERA-interim reanalysis data sets for 1989. To better understand the reasons that generate model biases, the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE results were compared with those of its components, the WRF/PCE and the ROMS-CICE. There are cold biases in surface air temperature (SAT) over the Arctic Ocean, which contribute to the sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) biases in the results of the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE. The cold SAT biases also appear in results of the atmospheric component with a mild temperature in winter and similar temperature in summer. Compared to results from the WRF/PCE, due to influences of different distributions of the SIC and the SST and inclusion of interactions of air-sea-sea ice in the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE, the simulated SAT has new features. These influences also lead to apparent differences at higher levels of the atmosphere, which can be thought as responses to biases in the SST and sea ice extent. There are similar atmospheric responses to sea ice biases at 700 and 500 hPa, and the strength of response weakens, with a height in January. The atmospheric responses in July reach up to 200 hPa. There are surplus sea ice extents in the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, the Davis Strait and the Chukchi Sea, resulting from the ROMS-CICE in winter and in the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea, the East Siberian Sea and the Laptev Sea in summer. These differences in the SIC distribution can all be explained by those in the SST distributions. These features in the simulated SST and SIC from ROMS-CICE also appear in the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE. It is shown that the performance of the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE is determined to a large extent by its components, the WRF/PCE and the ROMS-CICE.",

            "abstract": "Martian basaltic meteorites sample more sites than rovers have but, with only a few exceptions, they consist young (Amazonian) igneous rocks. Mars rovers mostly have sampled old (Late Hesperian) sedimentary rocks, although Gusev rocks analyzed by Spirit constitute the best-characterized igneous province on Mars. Because we have only one sedimentary meteorite – NWA 7034, a regolith breccia composed of igneous clasts – we will focus on comparing igneous rocks.\nBasaltic rocks analyzed so far on the planet’s surface are more alkaline than the meteorites. Limited trace element ratios from rover APXS also indicate differences in composition from meteorites. Orbital geochemical and mineralogical data are generally consistent with a basaltic surface, showing localized exposures of sedimentary rocks. Compositional differences may arise from melting and fractionation at different depths, under different redox states, or with different water contents.\nThe various data sets do show some linkages, however. Major mineral compositions are similar (and different from Earth), and rocks tend to be oxidized. Although no hydrous igneous minerals occur (except apatite), many parent magmas contained water that was mostly lost on ascent. It is surprising, then, that calc-alkaline rocks have not been found.\nHighly fractionated rocks are uncommon, but tephrites and mugearites occur in Gusev, Gale, and NWA 7034. Feldspathic rocks discovered by remote sensing and encountered at Gale are not yet understood.\nThe geochemically distinct magmas represented by different classes of martian meteorites and surface rocks demonstrate that the mantle sources for magmas are heterogeneous. These differences are primary, likely inherited from a magma ocean, since there is no crustal recycling. With only one source of data (either meteoritic or spacecraft), we would have a greatly simplified and incorrect view of martian petrogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Only recently has it become clear that the solar corona viewed in the EUV is detected out to far greater distances above the limb than had been expected (Seaton etal 2013). The reasons for the visibility of streamers out to >2 R_sol are unclear (Goaryaev etal 2014), but the fact that such structures can be seen is indisputable (Masson etal 2014). The EUV imaging instruments that have been used for these observations, such as TRACE, SWAP, STEREO and AIA, were not specifically designed to detect the extended corona, and such detection typically requires multiple exposures and mosaics. An instrument designed to obtain views of the extended EUV corona out to the nominal source surface with high efficiency is straightforward to build, and would provide 100X to 1000X higher sensitivity than current instruments. The main advantages of such EUV observations are: 1. the coronal dynamics and eruptions (such as CMEs) and the locations and effects of nearby streamers are visible from the start of the event on-disk; 2. the initial conditions of an event, including initial acceleration, changes of path due to interaction with nearby coronal structures, and propagation of coronal waves from the eruption site, are all directly seen; 3. the evolution of the eruption from the solar surface out to the inner edge of a white-light coronagraph can be seen, thus filling the gap in such WL images (Byrne etal 2014).\nWe will present a class of simple EUV wide-field imager designs for implementation on a low-cost platform. Operation in the EUV implies that Sun-centered pointing tolerances can be relaxed, dust and scattering are negligible issues, and simple optics will fulfill all requirements. Implementation on a Sun-pointed spinning spacecraft is possible without great difficulty.",

            "abstract": "In many ways, decompression melting and focused melt transport beneath oceanic spreading ridges is the best understood igneous process on Earth. However, there are remaining – increasing – uncertainties in interpreting residual mantle peridotites.\nIndicators of degree of melting in residual peridotite are questionable. Yb concentration and spinel Cr# are affected by (a) small scale variations in reactive melt transport, (b) variable extents of melt extraction, and (c) “impregnation”, i.e. partial crystallization of cooling melt in pore space. Roughly 75% of abyssal peridotites have undergone major element refertilization. Many may have undergone several melting events.\nThe following three statements are inconsistent: (1) Peridotite melt productivity beyond cpx exhaustion is > 0.1%/GPa. (2) Crustal thickness is independent of spreading rate at rates > 2 cm/yr full rate (excluding ultra-slow spreading ridges). (3) Thermal models predict, and observations confirm, thick thermal boundary layers beneath slow spreading ridges. If (a) melt productivity is << 0.1%/GPa beyond cpx-out, and (b) cpx-out occurs > 15 km below the seafloor beneath most ridges, then the independence of crustal thickness with spreading rate can be understood. Most sampled peridotites from ridges melted beyond cpx-out. Cpx in these rocks formed via impregnation and/or exsolution during cooling. Most peridotites beneath ridges may undergo cpx exhaustion during decompression melting. This would entail an upward modification of potential temperature estimates. Alternatively, perhaps oceanic crustal thickness does vary with spreading rate but this is masked by complicated tectonics and serpentinization at slow-spreading ridges.\nDissolution channels (dunites) are predicted to coalesce downstream, but numerical models of these have not shown why > 95% of oceanic crust forms in a zone < 5 km wide. There may be permeability barriers guiding deeper melt toward the ridge, but field studies have not identified them. Permeable “shear bands” may guide melt to the ridge, but their nature in open systems at natural grain size and strain rates is uncertain. 2D and 3D focused solid upwelling due to melt buoyancy deep in the melting region, where pyroxenes are abundant and permeability is low, may warrant renewed attention.",

            "abstract": "Flexible plants bend in response to fluid motion and this reconfiguration reduces drag forces, which protects against uprooting and breaking. The impact of reconfiguration can be described quantitatively by introducing a drag coefficient (CD) that decreases as a power-law function of velocity (U) with a negative exponent known as the Vogel number (B). That is, CD is proportional to UB. In this experimental study, we explored the link between reconfiguration and turbulence dynamics using a model seagrass meadow. As the flow rate in the channel increased, both the mean and unsteady reconfiguration increased. The unsteady reconfiguration, called monami, provides visual evidence that stronger turbulent events cause greater reconfiguration, and we hypothesize that the greater reconfiguration leads to proportionally lower drag, as reflected in a lower drag coefficient, such that stronger turbulent events preferentially penetrate deeper into the meadow. The preferential penetration of stronger events is reflected in the skewness of the streamwise velocity, which increases as the penetration of strong events gain greater preference. The measurements confirmed that a more negative Vogel number led to a higher skewness peak within the canopy. Previous studies were used to link the Vogel number and the Cauchy number. In the transition between the asymptotic regimes of negligible (B = 0) and strong (B = -2/3) reconfiguration, there is a regime of weak reconfiguration that extends over Ca = 10 to 100. The Vogel number achieved its peak negative value (B = -1.1) within the weak reconfiguration regime. The peak skewness also occurred within the regime of weak reconfiguration.",

            "abstract": "Erosion is intimately linked to chemical weathering, however we lack quantitative constraints on how erosion processes impact mineral weathering rates. Here we use the uranium-series isotope composition of river-borne material in small catchments of Puerto Rico and southeastern Australia to study the effect of contrasting erosion regimes on weathering.\nThe U-series isotope composition of stream sediments was modelled to infer a weathering age, i.e. the average time elapsed since the sediment’s minerals have started weathering. In southeastern Australia, the weathering age of stream sediments ranges between 346 ± 12 kyr and 1.78 ± 0.16 Myr, similar to values inferred from weathering profiles in the same catchment. Old weathering ages likely reflect the shallow origin of sediments mobilised via near-surface soil transport, the main mechanism of erosion in this catchment. Contrastingly, in Puerto Rico weathering ages are much younger, ranging from 5.1 ± 0.1 to 19.4 ± 0.4 kyr, reflecting that sediments are derived from less weathered, deeper saprolite, mobilised by landslides.\nWeathering ages of stream sediments are used to infer catchment-wide, mineral-specific weathering rates that are one to two orders of magnitude faster for Puerto Rico than for southeastern Australia. Thus, the type of erosion (near-surface soil transport vs. landslide) also affects the weathering rate of river sediments, because their weathering ages determine the potential for further weathering during sediment transport and storage in alluvial plains.",

Models predict earlier spring and later fall under future climate change, which would help slow the rate of warming by enabling increased carbon sequestration. That said, current models perform poorly, and there is little consensus as to what are the determining controls of spring and autumn phenology. Here, using global observations of deciduous forest phenology we determine the dominant biotic and abiotic controls, and develop a new suite of predictive models. We examine relationships between spatial and temporal variability, derive a coherent temperature sensitivity of spring phenology, and show that the timing of autumn senescence is dependent on the timing of spring budburst.",

            "abstract": "Land surface models and large-scale hydrological models are often used to study climate change impacts on hydrology at regional to global scales. These impacts are then presented as maps of change in specific runoff metrics that are relevant to basin management and water resources planning. Knowing the limits of model performance for the respective metrics of interest at different spatial and temporal scales is thus important, but often performance is only known for annual or long-term means. This contribution summarizes and reflects on the challenge of continental hydrological model simulations from the WATCH multi-model ensemble with distributed streamflow observations from small basins of reference networks in Europe. Characteristics of hydrological dynamics that were compared include spatial and temporal runoff persistence, high and low flows, and long-term trends and variability. Whereas common annual statistics between models and observations correlate well even if the amounts disagree, larger differences were found for metrics that focus on the dynamics of streamflow response and persistence. For example, models appear to respond comparably fast to precipitation, and as a consequence underestimate the duration of streamflow drought events. Investigating the general streamflow persistence in time and space, however, also showed large differences among the different models. Long-term trends in annual flow and annual weekly peak flow in Europe agreed on the large-scale patterns, but particularly seasonal trends and trends in extremes in regions with mixed observed runoff trends or in complex terrain revealed discrepancies to the observations even regarding the sign of the trend. Before the display of changes in hydrological characteristics related to response and persistence of flow situations, models should therefore always be tested specifically for their limits to represent such metrics.",

            "abstract": "Forests influence the budgets of greenhouse gases, and understanding how they will respond to environmental change is critical to accurately predicting future GHG trends. The time scale for climate change is long and forest growth is slow, thus very long measurement periods are required to observe meaningful forest response. We established an eddy flux tower within a mixed forest stand dominated by red oak and red maple at the Harvard Forest LTER site in 1989 where CO2, H2O and energy fluxes together with meteorological observations have been measured continuously. An array of plots for biometric measurements was established in 1993. Flux measurement at an adjacent hemlock stand began in 2000. Records of land use and disturbance and vegetation plot data extend back to 1907. The combined suite of measurements merges observations of instantaneous ecosystem responses to environmental forcing with details of vegetation dynamics and forest growth that represent the emergent properties relevant to long-term ecosystem change. Both the deciduous stand and hemlock stand are accumulating biomass. Each has added over 20 Mg-C ha-1 as woody biomass in trees >10cm dbh since 1990, even though the hemlock stand is older. Net carbon exchange shows enhanced uptake in early spring and late fall months in response to warmer temperatures and likely an increase in evergreen foliage at the deciduous site. Net carbon uptake efficiency at the deciduous stand has increased over time as well as indicated by peak NEE under optimum light conditions. The trend is only partly explained by variation in mean leaf area index and cannot be directly attributed to climate response. The combination of longer growing season and increased uptake efficiency yields a general trend of increasing annual NEE (Fig. 1). However, significant excursions in the trend highlight the sensitivity of forest carbon stocks. The pulse of high annual carbon uptake (peak 6 Mg-C ha-1y-1 in 2008) from 2000-2008 is only partially matched by carbon stored in woody biomass, leaving a large fraction of carbon to have accumulated in litter and fine roots in the forest floor, which has as much carbon as the above-ground woody biomass, but shorter turnover time. Invasion by Hemlock wooly adelgid, an insect that kills hemlock trees portends a major shift in NEE for the hemlock stand in the next decade.",

Using an AGCM, we further investigate this possibility by documenting contemporary spring-time relationships between SST trends and the SH extratropical atmospheric circulation. A suite of idealised simulations are analysed wherein the AGCM is forced by underlying SST conditions in which which trends over 1979-2009 are constrained to individual ocean basins (Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic), allowing the impact of each region to be assessed in isolation. When forced with global SST, the model broadly replicates the spatial pattern of geopotential height trends seen in reanalyses. Forcing the model by each ocean basin separately, however, reveals significant differences in the associated teleconnection patterns, with similar structures to reanalyses simulated only when Atlantic SST trends are included. It is revealed that such Atlantic teleconnections are associated with dynamical changes in the zonal Walker Circulation and a corresponding intensification of the local Hadley Cell, the impact of which results in the development of atmospheric Rossby waves. Thus, increased Rossby waves, forced by positive Atlantic SST trends, may have played a role in driving geopotential height trends in the SH extratropics. Consequently, changes to the regional atmospheric circulation promote warming throughout the Antarctic Peninsula/West Antarctica, with a pattern that closely matches observations. As such, Atlantic SST trends, via a teleconnection to the SH extratropics, may have contributed to springtime climatic change in Antarctica.",

In this study, we present results from assimilating satellite SSS fields from NASA’s Aquarius mission into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) operational Modular Ocean Model version 4 (MOM4), the oceanic component of NOAA’s operational seasonal-interannual Climate Forecast System (CFS). Experiments on the sensitivity of the ocean’s overall state to different relaxation time periods were run to evaluate the importance of assimilating high-frequency (daily to mesoscale) and low-frequency (seasonal) SSS variability. Aquarius SSS data (Aquarius Data Processing System (ADPS) version 3.0), mapped daily fields at 1-degree spatial resolution, were used. Four model simulations were started from the same initial ocean condition and forced with NOAA’s daily Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) fluxes, using a relaxation technique to assimilate daily satellite sea surface temperature (SST) fields and selected SSS fields, where, except as noted, a 30-day relaxation period is used. The simulations are: (1) WOAMC, the reference case and similar to the operational setup, assimilating monthly climatological SSS from the 2009 NOAA World Ocean Atlas; (2) AQ_D, assimilating daily Aquarius SSS; (3) AQ_M, assimilating monthly Aquarius SSS; and (4) AQ_D10, assimilating daily Aquarius SSS, but using a 10-day relaxation period. The analysis focuses on the tropical Pacific Ocean, where the salinity dynamics are intense and dominated by El Niño interannual variability in the cold tongue region and by high-frequency precipitation events in the western Pacific warm pool region. To assess the robustness of results and conclusions, we also examine the results for the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Preliminary validation studies are conducted using observations, such as satellite sea-surface height (SSH) fields and in situ Argo buoy vertical profiles of temperature and salinity, to demonstrate that SSS data assimilation improves ocean state representation of the following variables: ocean heat content (0-300m), dynamic height (0-1000m), mixed-layer depth, sea surface heigh, and surface buoyancy fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Dike intrusions both deform Earth's surface and induce propagating earthquake swarms. We develop methods to utilize both deformation and seismicity from brittle, volcano-tectonic earthquakes to image time-dependent dike propagation. Dieterich's [1994] seismicity rate theory is used to relate dike-induced stress changes to seismicity rate, and is combined with elastic Green's functions relating dike opening to deformation. Different space-time patterns of seismicity develop if earthquakes occur at the same depth as the dike, as opposed to above or below the dike. In the former, seismicity initiates near the dike's leading edges but shuts off as the dike tips pass and seismogenic volumes fall into stress shadows. In the latter, seismicity continues at a decaying rate after the dike tips pass. We focus on lateral propagation and develop a non-linear inversion method that solves for dike length and pressure as a function of time.\nThe method is applied to the 2007 Father's Day intrusion in Kilauea Volcano. Seismicity is concentrated at ~3 km depth, comparable to geodetic estimates of dike depth, and decays rapidly in time. With lateral propagation alone it is difficult to fit both GPS time series and the rapid down-rift jump in seismicity, suggesting significant vertical propagation. For the events to have occurred below the dike requires a very short aftershock decay time, hence unreasonably high background stressing-rate. The rapid decay is better explained if the dike extends somewhat below the seismicity. We suggest that joint inversion is useful for studying the diking process and may ultimately allow for improved short-term eruption forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Mangrove forests cover just 0.1% of the Earth’s terrestrial surface, yet they provide a disproportionate source (~10 % globally) of terrestrially derived, refractory dissolved organic carbon to the oceans. Mangrove forests are biogeochemical reactors that convert biomass into dissolved organic and inorganic carbon at unusually high rates, and many studies recognize the value of mangrove ecosystems for the substantial amounts of soil carbon storage they produce. However, questions remain as to how mangrove forest ecosystem services should be valuated and quantified. Therefore, this study addresses several objectives. First, we demonstrate that seasonal and annual net ecosystem carbon exchange in three selected mangrove forests, derived from long-term eddy covariance measurements, represent key quantities in defining the magnitude of biogeochemical cycling and together with other information on carbon cycle parameters serves as a proxy to estimate ecosystem services. Second, we model ecosystem productivity across the mangrove forests of Everglades National Park and southern China by relating net ecosystem exchange values to remote sensing data. Finally, we develop a carbon budget for the mangrove forests in the Everglades National Park for the purposes of demonstrating that these forests and adjacent estuaries are sites of intense biogeochemical cycling. One conclusion from this study is that much of the carbon entering from the atmosphere as net ecosystem exchange (~1000 g C m-2 yr-1) is not retained in the net ecosystem carbon balance. Instead, a substantial fraction of the carbon entering the system as net ecosystem exchange is ultimately exported to the oceans or outgassed as reaction products within the adjacent estuary.",

This has been done by creating and strengthening partnership and collaboration within scientific and educational communities around the country and the world.\nBecause CloudSat was formally recognized as a Earth System Science Pathfinder campaign with the GLOBE program, the CEN developed a set of field protocols for student observations that augmented the GLOBE atmosphere protocols when there was a satellite overpass.

In addition, the CEN has developed productive relationships with other NASA missions and EPO teams. Specifically, in collaboration with the NASA CERES mission projects S’Cool and MyNASAData, we have co-presented at NSTA conferences and with schools participating in a NASA EPOESS-funded formal education project.

            "abstract": "The modern Asian climate is mainly characterized by a monsoonal duality between humid summers in southern and eastern Asia and arid climate in Central Asia resulting in a strong seasonality in terms of precipitation and temperature in these respective regions. Asian Monsoons are also characterised by the aridification in Central Asia due to the foehn effect north of the Tibetan Plateau and the inherent perturbation of the atmospheric circulation generated by the monsoons. According to climate models, Asian Monsoons have been mainly governed by Tibetan plateau uplift, the retreat of a vast epicontinental sea (the Proto-Paratethys sea) and global climate changes. Evidence for monsoons a old as Eocene are starting to be established by proxy and model data. This corresponds to the timing of the Proto-Paratethys retreat, however, the role of this sea on climate and the monsoonal expression in that period remain to be established. Here we show, using infra-annual geochemical proxies from oyster shells of the Proto-Paratethys sea and climate simulations, that the Central Asian region was generally arid with high seasonality from hot and arid summers to wetter winters. This high seasonality in Central Asia therefore supports an intense monsoonal circulation was already established although the climate pattern was significantly different than today. During winter months, a strong influence of the Proto-Paratethys moisture is indicated by enhanced precipitations as well as modelled stable isotopic composition of precipitation significantly higher than today. This supports a strong influence on local climate of the Proto-Paratethys sea, which subsequently retreated and was replaced by the Pamir mountains. During Eocene summers, the local climate was more arid despite the presence of the Proto-Paratethys. This may be explained by a strong anticyclonic Hadley cell descending at these latitudes (25 to 45 N) over Central Asia during Eocene times. Furthermore, the Tibetan plateau emerging to the south may have generated a strong Foehn effect during summer months bringing warm and dry air in Central Asia.",

            "abstract": "Although Curiosity landed in a sedimentary setting, geochemical compositions determined by Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and ChemCam suggest that major element concentrations of some rocks were little modified by chemical weathering, and in these cases, the bulk (>70%) of the crystalline components determined by ChemMin are igneous. Gale rocks can therefore largely preserve the composition of their igneous protoliths and provide insight into the crystalline basement exposed in the north crater rim. Four end-member compositions are recognized on the basis of APXS analyses. (1) The diverse, evolved Jake M class (n=12) of inferred igneous origin includes float blocks and cobbles. Jake M rocks are phonotephritic/mugearitic to trachyandesitic and characterized by low MgO contents (3.0-5.7 wt%) and high Al and alkalis, particularly Na2O (up to 7.35 wt%). (2) The Bathurst class of siltstones to coarse sandstones (n=13) occurs as dark-toned float and bedded outcrop and is basaltic to trachybasaltic, ranging to high K2O (up to 3.8 wt%). Alteration of the protolith(s) or during diagenesis may have affected this class. (3) The Darwin class of conglomerates to coarse sandstones (n=10) has high Na and Al, likely reflecting a sodic plagioclase-rich mineralogy, but with higher Fe than Jake M class (13.0-17.1 vs. 6.0-12.5 wt%). (4) The low alkali “normal” Mars basaltic composition is typified by the Portage soils (n=6) and the John Klein class (n=13; includes the Sheepbed mudstone). Some degree of mixing and/or contamination with this low alkali basaltic compositon has affected all APXS analyses. Overall, Gale rocks are strongly enriched in total alkalis (at the same MgO) relative to basaltic shergottites and many have higher K2O than igneous rocks analyzed by Spirit and Opportunity, suggesting that the mantle beneath Gale is alkali-rich (likely as a result of a metasomatic event) and that alkalis are heterogeneously distributed in the planet’s interior.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between fluviodeltaic channel dynamics and external forcings is fundamental to our interpretation of stratigraphic records. While there have been great advances in subjects such as the effects of tectonic steering and base-level variation through field campaigns and physical experiments, numerical modeling has been relatively under-developed. This is partly due to the lack of models that are able to produce emergent channel dynamics, respond physically to various boundary conditions, and run efficiently over geological timescales.\n\nIn this work we apply a reduced-complexity model which satisfies the above criteria, DeltaRCM, to study how channel dynamics in a depositional system are affected by two factors: differential subsidence and base-level variation. In particular we investigate: (1) the changes in channel mobility with base-level rise; (2) how the fluvial surface is reworked with a set of tectonic styles and base-level cycles; (3) the preservation potential of the surface channel network in the sedimentary record. We present comparisons between our model results and physical experiments, with a discussion on the applicability of our reduced-complexity approach. An application on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna Delta shows how the model can be used as a tool for hypothesis formulation.",

            "abstract": "In the present study we numerically model the progradation and size stratification of a Gilbert type delta subject to base level fluctuations. A foreset-dominated Gilbert delta is a delta that is dominated by sediment avalanches over its front. It forms when a river flows into a basin or sea characterized by a flow depth that is much larger than the one in the fluvial reach and the sediment is relatively coarse. A Gilbert delta is typically described in terms of a low-slope topset, a steep-slope foreset, and a bottomset. Our model consists of three main submodels: a sediment mixture mass conservation model suitable for mixed sediment in the fluvial reach, a delta progradation model, and a lee face sorting model. In order to calibrate and validate the model under base level variation conditions, we reproduce three laboratory experiments in which the base level varied between the experiments: (I) constant base level, (II) a gradually rising base level, and (III) a slowly varying base level. The model is able to properly reproduce the main characteristics measured in the laboratory experiments. The active layer coarsens at the start of the runs similar to the mobile armor that formed in the laboratory experiments. Base level rise induces an M1 backwater curve over the fluvial reach. This results in an increasing flow depth in streamwise direction and so a streamwise decrease of the sediment transport capacity. This then induces aggradation over the fluvial reach and a slower delta progradation rate. The opposite happens when base level fall is imposed. The model captures the slightly coarser-than-fed grain size distribution of the topset deposit. The predicted size stratification in the foreset results to be weaker (i.e. less sorted) than measured.",

            "abstract": "Several studies have been conducted to quantify and characterize terrestrial water storage changes over the Congo’s wetlands, especially focusing on the central Congo Basin, or Cuvette Centrale, where vast wetlands can be found. The annual variations of the total storage changes over the Cuvette Centrale wetlands were estimated to range between ~20 km3 to ~30 km3 using PALSAR ScanSAR, Envisat altimetry, and GRACE RL05 data, mostly controlled by surface water. Furthermore, based on precipitation minus evapotranspiration anomalies, and a hydraulic analysis using Envisat altimetry data, the source of the Cuvette Centrale wetland’s water is likely to be local upland runoff rather than the fluvial process of river-floodplain exchange as in the Amazon.\nOn the other hand, if we consider the Cuvette Centrale as the lower middle reach of the Congo, little attention has been paid to the upper middle reach of the Congo River, from just downstream of Kisangani to the intersection where the mainstem and the Lulonga River meets. In this study, we will use PALSAR images and Envisat altimetry data to estimate surface water storage changes over the floodplains in the upper middle reaches to make comparison with the lower middle reach. We will also perform the hydraulic analysis using Envisat altimetry height profiles over the river and its adjacent floodplains to examine the source of its water. Finally, the total storage changes, estimated from GRACE regional solutions with higher temporal and spatial resolutions based on the energy conservation principle and the Hillslope River Routing (HRR) model will be investigated to highlight their differences between the upper and lower middle reaches.",

            "abstract": "Halfway between the Salton Sea and San Gorgonio Pass, the southernmost San Andreas Fault (SAF) bifurcates into the Mission Creek and Banning strands. These strands bound the Indio Hills (IH), and mark the first of a series of left-stepping branches that define the transpressional, southern Big Bend of the SAF. Between the fault strands, the Quaternary Ocotillo Formation is deformed with fold axis orientations consistent with dextral shear; structurally the IH are synclinal in the east, transitioning to a complex antiform with increased uplift suggested by exhumation of Tertiary units in the west. We report new long- and short-term erosion rates across the IH and uplift rates on the Banning strand, and we evaluate these measurements in terms of slip rates across the fault system and structural deformation within the IH. Two methods of catchment-averaged erosion rates provide minimum rates yield similar results, (0.08 to 0.34 mm/yr) across 6 catchments. The long-term rates are calculated from eroded volumes estimated from a 10-m DEM surface enveloping the Indio Hills and assume that all folding and uplift initiated ca. 500ka (the 750 ka Bishop ash is uplifted and warped within the IH). The short-term rates, determined from 10Be dating of alluvial sediments, increase gradually to the northwest. Similarity of the rates suggests steady state uplift over the history of the fold; ongoing structural analysis and dating needed to constrain the maximum rates will test this possibility. The new uplift rate for the Banning strand at the east end of the IH is determined from a 60 pts/m^2 DEM produced by structure from motion photogrammetry and U-series ages and cosmogenic dates that provide an age range of 20-76ka for a fan vertically offset by ~2.5 m. The resulting uplift rate on the fault (0.03-0.125 mm/yr) overlaps with the short-term catchment-averaged erosion rate for this location (0.08 mm/yr). Consequently, we interpret that vertical strain is partitioned onto both the Banning fault and in uplift and folding of the IH. The uplift rates increase westward along the IH, possibly indicating increased activity on the Banning strand to the west. This pattern will be considered in the context of paleoseismic and horizontal slip rate studies in the region, and implications for rupture directivity on this hazardous fault system.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence is investigated using in-situ measurements both in the solar wind and within a high-speed reconnection jet in the terrestrial magnetotail. In the solar wind, reconnection events and current sheets are found for the first time to be concentrated in intervals of intermittent turbulence: within the most non-Gaussian 1% of magnetic field fluctuations, 87-92% of reconnection exhausts and about 9% of current sheets are found. Also, the likelihood that an identified current sheet will also correspond to a reconnection exhaust increases dramatically as the least intermittent fluctuations are removed. Hence, the turbulent solar wind contains a hierarchy of intermittent magnetic field structures that are increasingly linked to current sheets, which in turn are progressively more likely to correspond to sites of magnetic reconnection. In a magnetotail reconnection jet, the work done by electromagnetic fields on the particles, J·E, is found for the first time to have a non-Gaussian heavy tailed probability density function. Furthermore, J·E is non-uniform and concentrated in regions of high electric current density. This suggests magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy within the reconnection jet in a manner that is intermittent, and could be analogous to fluid-like turbulent phenomenology where dissipation proceeds via coherent structures generated by an intermittent cascade. These results could have far reaching implications for space and astrophysical plasmas where turbulence and magnetic reconnection are ubiquitous.",

The activities which alter vegetation cover, biomass, and phenology, directly influence regional to global climate through modification of surface biophysical properties and the surface energy balance. Land-use activities are also impact climate through changes in carbon and nitrogen balances and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, land-use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet future demands for food, feed, fiber, and energy. The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) achieved a qualitative scientific advance in studying the effects of land-use on climate, for the first time explicitly accounting for the effects of global gridded land-use changes (past-future) in coupled carbon-climate model projections. Enabling this advance, the first consistent gridded land-use dataset (past-future) was developed, linking historical land-use data to future projections from Integrated Assessment Models, in a standard format required by climate models (“Land-use Harmonization”). Results from climate models indicate that the effects of land-use on climate, while uncertain, are sufficiently large and complex to warrant an expanded treatment of land-use. Here, we review past progress, future priorities, and present on new data and models designed to improve the understanding of the effects of land-use on climate (past-future).

Wetlands are important network elements, providing hydrological, biogeochemical and biological functions that vary along a continuum of connectivity with nearby and downstream waters. Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), those surrounded by uplands, occupy the entire connectivity continuum, but generally fall outside US legal protections unless a “significant nexus” to navigable waters is demonstrated. Geographic isolation does not imply hydrological, biogeochemical or biological isolation. Here we show multiple lines of evidence to support the inference that GIWs are integral to the function of navigable waters. Moreover, while GIW hydro-chemical connectivity may be episodic or slow (e.g., via groundwater), and biological connectivity limited by overland dispersal, reducing material or organism exchange is specifically what enables important, sometimes unique, functions. This relational connectivity, wherein precluded exchange creates functionality, may be as important to downstream waters as more obvious connections. Logic and evidence support the presumption that anthropogenic changes to GIW prevalence, condition and connectivity have significant downstream impacts.",

            "abstract": "The upper continental crust (UCC), the interface between the atmosphere and solid Earth, is the site of weathering that produces sedimentary rocks, influences ocean chemistry through runoff of soluble elements, and affects climate through CO2 draw-down. The UCC also contains more than 50% of the crust’s highly incompatible element budget (including K, Th, and U). Therefore, understanding its composition and evolution provides insight into how continents have formed, evolved, and interacted with the hydrosphere. New major and trace element compositions of >100 glacial diamictites and >100 Archean shales, plus δ7Li and δ18O for a subset of these samples, combined with data from the literature, show that the average composition of the UCC has changed through time, reflecting both the rise of atmospheric oxygen and its attendant effects on weathering, as well as the mode of crust formation and differentiation. Some changes that occur as a step function near the Archean/Proterozoic boundary (increased Th/U, decreased Mo/Pr, V/Lu) reflect the rise of oxygen at the great oxidation event (GOE) and its influence on chemical weathering signatures in the UCC. Other changes are more gradual with time (e.g., higher Th/Sc and δ18O, lower Ni/Co, La/Nb, Eu/Eu* and transition metal abundances) and reflect an UCC that has transitioned from a more mafic to a more felsic bulk composition, and which experienced increased interaction with the hydrosphere with time. The gradual nature of these compositional changes likely reflects the waning heat production of the Earth, rather than an abrupt change in tectonics or style of crust formation. These more gradual changes in crust composition, which contrast with the abrupt changes associated with the GOE, suggest that a fundamental change in the nature of crust differentiation is unlikely to be responsible for the rise of atmospheric oxygen (cf. Keller and Schoene, 2012). Indeed, it appears that the opposite may be true: that the rise of oxygen has influenced crust composition (and possibly differentiation).",

            "abstract": "One emerging and important control on catchment hydrological functions of water storage, mixing and release is bedrock geology. Until today, catchment-based work has been limited by small ranges of rock types in adjacent basins. Moreover, conventional hydrological tracer approaches suffer from limitations inherent to the large storages related to certain bedrock types (e.g. the damping of stable isotope tracer signatures in deep storage catchments and obliteration of output signals at larger spatial scales).\nHere, we show how a multi-tracer approach, based on terrestrial diatoms and different stable and radioactive isotopic tracers can help refining our understanding of the dominant controls on catchment hydrological functions, especially the role of bedrock geology. We present new data and results from a nested catchment set-up, located in the Alzette River basin in Luxembourg (Europe). These 16 catchments (with sizes ranging from 0.47 to 285 km2) are characterized by clean and mixed assemblages of geology and land use. We have monitored these systems since 2002, including meteorological variables (precipitation, air temperature, etc.), as well as 15 minute discharge. Additional parameters have been monitored bi-weekly and at the event time scale, including geochemical and isotopic (3H, D, 18O) tracers, as well as terrestrial diatom communities in streamwater.\nOur results show that water balance derived dynamic storage significantly differs across the 16 catchments and scales. Catchment mixing potential inferred from standard deviations in stream baseflow ∂D (as a proxy for the damping of isotopic signatures in precipitation), as well as tritium-derived baseflow transit times, both exhibit a significant spatial variability, but strong correlation to bedrock pemeability. Terrestrial diatom assemblages in streamwater, as a proxy for rapid flow pathway connectedness to the stream network, are highly variable across the study catchments but also show strong correlation with geology.\nOur work suggests a hierarchy of controls on catchment function. Eventually, geology (namely bedrock permeability) trumps other physiographic characteristics such as land use or topography in controlling fundamental catchment functions of storage, mixing and release.",

            "abstract": "In soils and sediments microorganisms perform essential ecosystem services through their roles in regulating the stability of carbon and the flux of nutrients, and the purification of water. But these are complex systems with the physical, chemical and biological components all intimately connected. Components of this complexity are gradually being uncovered and our understanding of the extent of microbial functional diversity in particular has been enhanced greatly with the development of cultivation independent approaches. However we have not moved far beyond a descriptive and correlative use of this powerful resource. As the ability to reconstruct thousands of genomes from microbial populations using metagenomic techniques gains momentum, the challenge will be to develop an understanding of how these metabolic blueprints serve to influence the fitness of organisms within these complex systems and how populations emerge and impact the physical and chemical properties of their environment.\nIn the presentation we will discuss the development of a trait-based model of microbial activity that simulates coupled guilds of microorganisms that are parameterized including traits extracted from large-scale metagenomic data. Using a reactive transport framework we simulate the thermodynamics of coupled electron donor and acceptor reactions to predict the energy available for respiration, biomass development and exo-enzyme production. Each group within a functional guild is parameterized with a unique combination of traits governing organism fitness under dynamic environmental conditions. This presentation will address our latest developments in the estimation of trait values related to growth rate and the identification and linkage of key fitness traits associated with respiratory and fermentative pathways, macromolecule depolymerization enzymes and nitrogen fixation from metagenomic data. We are testing model sensitivity to initial microbial composition and intra-guild trait variability amongst other parameters and are using this model to explore abiotic controls on community emergence and impact on rates of reactions that contribute to the cycling of carbon across biogeochemical gradients from the soil to the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "The burial of organic carbon (OC) in river deltas and continental margins worldwide account for approximately 90% of the carbon burial in the ocean. In particular, sediments in large-river delta-front estuaries have been shown to be repositories and integrators of land-use change across expansive watersheds that drain the continents to the ocean. Thus, separating natural and human-driven changes in the transport of terrestrial organic carbon (TOC) to ocean is important in understanding the effects of climate change on TOC fluxes. Molecular biomarkers of TOC (e.g., lignin phenols, fatty acids, sterols) in LDE sediments have been used extensively to reconstruct of carbon cycling changes that are reflective of land-use change in the watersheds. However, due to the highly variable hydrologic regimes across continents, continental margins (e.g., active versus passive), and coastal dynamics in LDEs, the fate and transport of these molecular biomarkers varies considerably. Here I will discuss some of the key molecular biomarkers that have been used to date in such historical reconstruction exercises in LDEs (e.g., Mississippi/Atchafalaya, Yangtze, Yellow, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Colville Rivers), and explore how margin-type, residence time of transport, redox, and molecular stability, to name a few, impact the utility of using different biomarkers in paleo-reconstruction studies.",

            "abstract": "The recent development of anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) scenarios that cover all or part of the preindustrial Holocene (11,700 BP to ~AD 1850) has led to a number of modelling studies on the impacts of land cover change on climate, using both GCMs and regional climate models. Because most ALCC scenarios arrive at similar estimates of anthropogenic deforestation by the late preindustrial, most models agree that the net biogeophysical effect of ALCC by AD 1850 is regional cooling at mid- to high-latitudes and warming and drying over the tropics and subtropics. In particular, tropical deforestation appears to lead to local amplification of externally forced drought cycles, e.g., from ENSO. The spatial extent of these climate changes varies between models because the choice of ALCC scenario leads to large differences in the initial forcing. Those model studies that considered biogeochemical feedbacks show that the importance of preindustrial CO2 emissions ranges from being insignificant to larger than the global biogeophysical feedback, depending on assumptions made about potential natural atmospheric CO2 at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. While the net magnitude of deforestation is similar among ALCC scenarios at AD 1850, the timing of deforestation varies widely, which, in addition to affecting the inferred importance of biogeochemical feedbacks, leads to large differences in the estimated importance of ALCC on climate earlier in the Holocene. For example, modelling experiments performed on Europe and the Mediterranean representing conditions at the peak of the Roman Empire or in Mesoamerica for the Classic Maya period show large differences in the estimated importance of the biogeophysical feedback to regional climate depending on the ALCC scenario used. The wide variety of results gained so far from ALCC and climate modelling experiments shows that the question of “how much did humans influence the state of the Earth System before the Industrial Revolution?” is far from being resolved. Future improvements to ALCC scenarios that improve thematic resolution to go beyond simple deforestation are essential, for example to include locally important types of historical land use such as irrigation and forest pasture, and Earth System models should move towards coupling between ALCC and climate.",

            "abstract": "Since 2009 the central and eastern United States has experienced an unprecedented increase in the rate of M≥3 earthquakes that is unlikely to be due to natural variation. Where the rates have increased so has the seismic hazard, making it important to understand these changes. Areas with significant seismicity increases are limited to areas where oil and gas production take place. By far the largest contributor to the seismicity increase is Oklahoma, where recent studies suggest that these rate changes may be due to fluid injection (e.g., Keranen et al., Geology, 2013; Science, 2014). Moreover, the area of increased seismicity in northern Oklahoma that began in 2013 coincides with the Mississippi Lime play, where well completions greatly increased the year before the seismicity increase. This suggests a link to oil and gas production either directly or from the disposal of significant amounts of produced water within the play.\nFor the purpose of assessing the hazard due to these earthquakes, should they be treated differently from natural earthquakes? Previous studies suggest that induced seismicity may differ from natural seismicity in clustering characteristics or frequency-magnitude distributions (e.g., Bachmann et al., GJI, 2011; Llenos and Michael, BSSA, 2013). These differences could affect time-independent hazard computations, which typically assume that clustering and size distribution remain constant. In Oklahoma, as well as other areas of suspected induced seismicity, we find that earthquakes since 2009 tend to be considerably more clustered in space and time than before 2009. However differences between various regional and national catalogs leave unclear whether there are significant changes in magnitude distribution.\nWhether they are due to natural or industrial causes, the increased earthquake rates in these areas could increase the hazard in ways that are not accounted for in current hazard assessment practice. Clearly the possibility of induced earthquakes needs to be considered in seismic hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "When we think of sensor networks, we often focus on hardware development and deployments and the resulting data and synthesis. Yet, for networks that cross institutional boundaries, such as distributed federations of observatories, people are the critical network resource. They establish the linkages and enable access to and interpretation of the data. In the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), we found that careful integration of three networks --people, hardware, and data--was essential to providing an effective research environment. Accomplishing this integration is not trivial and requires a shared vision among members, explicit attention to the emerging tenets of the science of team science, and training of scientists at all career stages. In GLEON these efforts have resulted in scientific inferences covering new scales, crossing broad ecosystem gradients, and capturing important environmental events. Network-level capital has been increased by the deployment of instrumented buoys, the creation of new data sets and publicly available models, and new ways to synthesize and analyze high frequency data. The formation of international teams of scientists is essential to these goals. Our approach unites a diverse membership in GLEON-style team science, with emphasis on training and engagement of graduate students while creating knowledge.\nExamples of the bottom-up scientific output from GLEON include creating and confronting models using high frequency data from sensor networks; interpreting output from biological sensors (e.g., algal pigment sensors) as predictors for water quality indices such as water clarity; and understanding the relationship between occasional, highly noxious algal blooms and fluorometric measurements of pigments from sensor networks. Numerical simulation models are not adequate for predicting highly skewed distributions of phytoplankton in eutrophic lakes, suggesting that our fundamental understanding of phytoplankton population dynamics needs modification as do our models, both of which can be improved with the use of high frequency data.",

This 15.8 Tg N yr-1 input to air, land and water has important social, economic and environmental consequences, yet little research clearly links this N release to the full suite of effects. Here we connect the biogeochemical fluxes of N with existing data on N-associated damages in order to quantify the externalities of N release related to human health, ecosystems and climate regulation for the US at national and watershed scales. Release of N to the environment was estimated circa 2000 with models describing N inputs by source, nutrient uptake efficiency, leaching losses, and gaseous emissions at the scale of 8-digit US Geologic Survey Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC8s). Potential damages or benefits of anthropogenic N leaked to the environment were calculated by scaling specific N fluxes with the costs associated with human health, agriculture, ecosystems, and the climate system. For the US, annual damage costs of anthropogenic N leaked to the environment in 2000 totaled $289 billion USD. Approximately 57% of the total damages were associated with fossil fuel combustion, driven by the human respiratory health impacts of NOx as a precursor of ozone and a component of particulates. Another 37% of the damage costs were associated with agricultural N. Damages associated with agriculture were $85.5 billion, largely through eutrophication and harmful effects on aquatic habitat. Through aggressive but tangible improvements in atmospheric emissions, agricultural N use and wastewater treatment, we could reduce N export to the coast by nearly 25% within 30 years. These improvements would reduce the externalities associated with the leakage of N beyond its intended uses in agriculture, transportation and energy with minimal impact to these sectors dependent on anthropogenic N fixation.",

The -5 common spectrum eventually rolls over at a speed corresponding to the maximum energy to which particles are accelerated. In the inner heliosphere the rollover occurs at quite low energies and thus the -5 portion is only observed in suprathermal particles. In the heliosheath, the rollover occurs at much higher energies and the common spectrum is observed over the full energy range of the Voyager energetic particle instruments, up to energies of ~100 MeV. Here recent and previous observations of the common spectrum in the heliosphere and heliosheath are presented, with emphasis on those that best reveal the conditions in which the acceleration must operate. Finally, we describe the physics of the pump acceleration mechanism, that yields the common -5 power law spectrum, and relate the rollover speeds to conditions in the regions where particles are accelerated.",

Indeed, a regional fossil fuel and biofuel inventory for gases and particulates described in Liousse et al. (2014) has been developed for Africa at a resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° for the years 2005 and 2030. For 2005, the original database of Junker and Liousse (2008) was used after modification for updated regional fuel consumption and emission factors. Two prospective inventories for 2030 are derived based on Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model (Criqui, 2001). The first is a reference scenario (2030ref) with no emission controls and the second is for a \"clean\" scenario (2030ccc*) including Kyoto policy and African specific emission control. This inventory predicts very large increases of pollutant emissions in 2030 (e.g. contributing to 50% of global anthropogenic organic particles), if no emission regulations are implemented.\nThese inventories have been introduced in RegCM4 model. In this paper we will focus on aerosol modelled concentrations in 2005, 2030ref and 2030ccc*. Spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations will be presented with a zoom at a few urban and rural sites. Finally mortality rates (respiratory, cardiovascular) caused by anthropogenic PM2.5 increase from 2005 to 2030, calculated following Lelieveld et al. (2013), will be shown for each scenarios.\nTo conclude, this paper will discuss the effectiveness of scenarios to reduce emissions, aerosol concentrations and mortality rates, underlining the need for further measurements scheduled in the frame of the new DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions) program.",

            "abstract": "Biochar is the solid byproduct from the pyrolysis of agricultural crop residues, manures, green wastes and wood-based materials. Pyrolyzing biomass causes inorganic and organic compounds to be concentrated within the carbonized remains of the original lignin and cellulose structure. It is through this complex mixture of organic aromatic structures and inorganic elements that potentially imparts biochars with special multi-functional capabilities. Our current research has focused on developing biochar to simultaneously sequester soil carbon and remediate degraded soils. This is accomplished by directly improving soil nutrient and moisture contents, sorbing pollutants, as well as altering microbial signaling. Maintaining these improvements needs to account for biochar physical degradation, which may be overcome by biochar-mineral associations. Additional research is focused on biochar use that minimizes soil microorganism population shifts in order to maintain current ecosystem services. Future USDA research involves more evaluations to understand the multifunctional role of biochar in the agricultural and environmental sectors (e.g., USEPA superfund locations). This presentation will provide highlights of current and future coordinated biochar research efforts from several key laboratory locations across the US.",

            "abstract": "The Motion Decoupled Hydraulic Delivery System (MDHDS) is a new downhole tool delivery system that is deployed by wireline and uses drill string pressure to advance a penetrometer (or other downhole tool) into the formation at the bottom of the borehole. After hydraulic deployment of the penetrometer, the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is completely decoupled from the penetrometer; this eliminates the adverse effects of ship heave. We tested the MDHDS at Site U1402 (the location of Site 1073, ODP Leg 174A), offshore New Jersey, during two days of ship time during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 342. We emplaced a penetrometer successfully and documented that the penetrometer was decoupled from drill string movement. The pore pressure (7.5 MPa) was slightly overpressured. Based on this successful field test, the MDHDS has been certified by the USIO for shipboard use. The MDHDS is an IODP-funded engineering development led by The University of Texas at Austin, in conjunction with the USIO and Stress Engineering Services. This sea trial was the culmination of a 7 year development effort that included extensive engineering design, fabrication, and field testing.",

            "abstract": "The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Students’ Cloud Observations On-Line (S’COOL) Project began in 1997 as a collaboration between a Virginia Middle School teacher, and several NASA Langley Research Center scientists. The project’s aim is to involve classroom students in observing and reporting cloud parameters to assist in the validation of NASA’s CERES satellite instruments, thus connecting classroom science work to the outside world. In 2007, S’COOL added a Citizen Science component called ROVER. ROVER is geared toward informal observers not tied to one observation location. The S’COOL Project has been successful due to a combination of its flexibility of implementation, training and involvement opportunities, intuitive and free resources, and this authentic connection to an ongoing scientific activity.\nThrough S’COOL’s multiple participation avenues, all participants are invited to collect cloud data following S’COOL guidelines. Their cloud data is later matched with corresponding satellite data. Within a week of submitting their report, a participant will be sent a “match” email, if their observation aligns to a satellite overpass. This “match” shows their ground report next to the satellite data for comparison and analysis. All ground observations and satellite matches are archived in a S’COOL database, accessible to the public. This multi-step process enables an on-going, two-way interaction between students and NASA, which is much more engaging than more typical one-way outreach experiences.\nTo complement and enable the cloud observation component, the S’COOL website offers formal and informal education communities a wide variety of atmospheric science related learning resources. These educator created resources are supplemented with carefully crafted background information from the science team. Alignment of the project to the Next Generation Science Standards is underway now, and will highlight the many science process skills involved in S’COOL participation. The S’COOL team works to provide both formal and informal audiences with an authentic STEM experience for cloud observers of all ages.\nThis presentation will review best practices from 17 years of Earth Science Education and Public Outreach in reference to the S’COOL Project.",

All OBS have been successfully recovered. We also have been operating 37 land seismometers on the islands of La Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues, southern Seychelles, îles Eparses, and on Madagascar between 2011 and 2014.\n As the data collection stage is drawing to a close, we discuss data yield and quality with respect to RHUM-RUM’s primary purpose (passive seismological imaging through all depth levels of the mantle) and secondary applications (“environmental seismology” in a sparsely instrumented area, e.g., tracking of tropical cyclones).

            "abstract": "The sedimentary strata of the North Sea Basin (NSB) record the glacial and interglacial history of environmental change in the Northern Hemisphere, and are a proposed location for the engineered storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from power plant and industrial sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These aspects interact in the geomechanical and fluid flow domain, as ice sheet dynamics change the properties of potential seal and reservoir rocks that are the prospective geological storage strata for much of Europe’s captured CO2.\nThe intensification of the global glacial-interglacial cycle at the onset of the Pleistocene (2.5-2.7 Ma) was a critical tipping-point in Earth’s recent climate history. The increased severity of glaciations at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary triggered the first development of large-scale continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. The central part of the NSB preserves a unique history of the depositional record spanning at least the last 3 Ma, which also forms the overburden and seal to the underlying CO2 reservoirs. There is good evidence that these ice sheets created strong feedback loops that subsequently affected the evolution of the Quaternary climate system through complex ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere linkages.\nUnderstanding NSB dynamics, including the role of fluids in controlling compaction, cementation, and diagenetic processes in shale-dominated basins, is essential for CO2 storage site characterisation to increase understanding and confidence in secure storage. An increased understanding of the overlying sequence will inform quantitative predictions of the performance of prospective CO2 storage sites in glaciated areas in Europe and worldwide; to include improved resolution of glacial cycles (depositional and chronological framework), characterise pore fluids, flow properties of glacial landforms within the sequence (e.g. tunnel valleys) and the geomechanical effects (quantify compaction, rock stiffness, strength and stress profiles) of advancing and retreating ice on the underlying strata to verify and constrain models of glaciation.\nThis presentation describes current work and introduces a proposal submitted to the Integrated Ocean Discovery Program (852-Pre) by the authors.",

            "abstract": "The position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has been hypothesized to play a role in linking the climate of the poles and in predicating important changes in ocean overturning, particularly on deglacial timescales. The position of the ITCZ has also been linked to changes in equatorial upwelling strength, marine productivity, terrestrial aridity and even the collapse of civilizations.\nOne method of tracking the paleo-position of the ITCZ is through the quantification of 230Thxs,0-normalized 232Th concentrations in marine sediments which acts as proxy for dust flux. Because the ITCZ is an efficient scavenger of atmospheric particulates, changes in the latitude of maximum dust flux can yield insight into variations in ITCZ position. Previous studies have used this technique to reconstruct the movement of the ITCZ during the last deglaciation at low resolution, but no studies have attempted to resolve the movement of the ITCZ during Termination II (Marine Isotope Stage 6-5) or during the ensuing glacial inception (MIS 5-4). Termination II is a time interval of particular interest because of its potential to yield information about the similarities of deglacial transitions despite different orbital configurations.\nWe present high-resolution (sub millennial) proxy records of dust flux, marine productivity and thermocline upwelling from 150-60 kyr at two sites in the central equatorial Pacific (cruise MGL-1208). These records provide the first evidence of an abrupt climatic shift during the deglaciation with timing similar to that of Heinrich Event 11 (H11). We evaluate the interpretation of this event both as a northern hemisphere increase in aeolian dust abundance concomitant with H11, and as a signature of an ITCZ shift during the deglaciation. We compare our data sets to existing records of the last deglaciation and infer large-scale similarities between Terminations I and II.",

A warmer climate has potential for a series of positive economic effects, such as development of maritime transportation, enhanced agricultural production and decrease in energy consumption. However, these potential benefits may be outwaited by negative impacts related to transportation accessibility and stability of existing infrastructure, especially in permafrost regions. Compared with the Arctic zones of other countries, the Russian Arctic is characterized by higher population, greater industrial development and urbanization. Arctic urban areas and associated industrial sites are the location of some of intense interaction between man and nature. However, while there is considerable research on various aspects of Arctic climate change impacts on human society, few address effects on Arctic cities and their related industries. This presentation overviews potential climate-change impacts on Russian urban environments in the Arctic and discusses methodology for addressing complex interactions between climatic, permafrost and socio-economic systems at the range of geographical scales. We also provide a geographic assessment of selected positive and negative climate change impacts affecting several diverse Russian Arctic cities.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing biomes on earth. Research at the Toolik Field Station by the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research project provides a perspective on changes that are impacting the upland tussock tundra region of the North Slope of Alaska, a region that is typical of ~15% of the arctic region. The arctic is responding to a combination of long-term, gradual changes (presses) and short-term, event-driven changes (pulses). The most important press, of course, is the persistent rise in average annual air temperature observed in most places (though not at Toolik). Associated with this increase in SAT is a well-documented increase in shallow permafrost temperature (which is observed around Toolik). Our long-term research shows that this trend will favor taller and more productive shrub and grass vegetation. Higher SAT translates to earlier spring breakup and later onset of winter. This change in seasonality is affecting interactions between shrub leaf-out, insect emergence, and bird nesting. Persistent and more frequent droughts are having important impacts on the ability of Arctic grayling – the top consumer is most upland tundra streams – to survive and has the potential to block their ability to migrate to essential overwintering lakes. The interaction between temperature (which is changing) and light (which is not) creates a “seasonal asynchrony” that may be increasing the loading of nutrients – notably nitrate – to upland tundra streams late in the season, with impacts that we do not fully understand yet. The upland tundra environment is also responding to an increasing frequency of pulses, most notably wildfires and the development of thermo-erosional failures (TEFs). Wildfires transfer large quantities of carbon and nitrogen directly to the atmosphere. TEFs may deliver large quantities of sediment and nutrients to streams and lakes. Currently these pulse disturbances seem to be having only limited, local impacts. However, as shallow permafrost in the arctic region approaches the 0ºC tipping point, the combination of presses and pulses may radically and rapidly alter upland tundra terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These changes will almost certainly occur more rapidly than would be the case if the region were influenced by the press of warming temperature alone.",

            "abstract": "Humans have been releasing mercury (Hg) to the environment for millenia through activities such as mining and fuel combustion. The result has been an enrichment of the ocean, atmosphere, and terrestrial ecosystems. Consumption of marine fish contaminated with methylmercury (MeHg) is the primary route of exposure in many populations globally. We present an updated analysis of sources of MeHg exposures in the United States that shows the majority (>70%) is from oceanic fish rather than coastal species. Using a fully coupled biogeochemical box model we also estimate Hg accumulation across major ocean basins and show anthropogenic enrichment is highest in the North Atlantic Ocean and lowest in the deep Pacific Ocean. Our results for contemporary ocean concentrations are consistent with recent data from the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans measured as part of the CLIVAR repeat hydrography program. Our estimates of natural (i.e., pre-anthropogenic) seawater Hg concentrations are lower than suggested by other studies, implying a greater anthropogenic perturbation in the ocean. Our work suggests total accumulation of anthropogenic Hg in the global oceans is greater than recently derived based on anthropogenic CO2. We compare modeled seawater concentrations since 1980 to observations over this period to evaluate evidence for changes in recent decades and then investigate potential impacts of changing global emissions. To do this, we use a range of historical and future anthropogenic Hg emission inventories. Our previous work using the box model indicates burial of Hg at ocean margins is the single largest global sink of anthropogenic Hg. We will discuss how the magnitude and permanence of this sink affects estimates of enrichment and time scales of recovery in all geochemical Hg reservoirs. Governing time scales of response in each ocean basin are diagnosed using eigenanalysis and discussed in the context of changes in human MeHg exposure resulting from regulation of human Hg sources.",

            "abstract": "The rhizosphere is a hotbed of nutrient cycling fueled by carbon from plants and controlled by microbes. Plants also strongly affect the rhizosphere by driving water flow into and out of roots, and by oxygenating saturated soil and sediment. Location and dynamics of plant-spurred microbial growth and activities are impossible to discern with destructive soil assays mixing microbe-scale soil microenvironments in a single”snap-shot” sample. Yet data are needed to inform (and validate) models describing microbial activity and biogeochemistry in the ebb and flow of the dynamic rhizosphere.\nDynamics and localization of rapid microbial growth in the rhizosphere can be assessed over time using living soil microbiosensors. We used the bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as host to plasmid pZKH2 containing a fusion between the strong constituitive promoter nptII and luxCDABE(genes coding for light production). High light production by KT2440/pZKH2 correlated with rapid microbial growth supported by high carbon availability. Biosensors were used in clear-sided microcosms filled with non-sterile soil in which corn, black poplar or tomato were growing. KT2440/pZKH2 revealed that root tips are not necessarily the only, or even the dominant, hotspots for rhizosphere microbial growth, and carbon availability is highly variable in space and time around roots.\nRoots can also be sources of oxygen (O2) to the rhizosphere in saturated soil. We quantified spatial distributions of O2 using planar optodes placed against the face of sediment blocks cut from vegetated salt marsh at Plum Island Ecosystems LTER. Integrated over time, Spartina alterniflora roots were O2 sources to the rhizosphere. However, “sun-up” (light on) did not uniformly enhance rhizosphere O2 concentrations (as stomata opened and O2 production commenced). In some regions, the balance of O2 supply (from roots) and O2 demand (root and microbial) tipped toward demand at sun-up (repeatedly, over days). We speculate that in these regions, carbon produced during photosynthesis was released from roots and stimulated microbial O2 demand in the light. In situ, such dynamics in O2 and carbon availability around plant roots will influence interlinked sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycling in salt marsh rhizosphere.",

            "abstract": "On 22 March 2014 a large, rapidly moving landslide impacted the community of Steelhead Haven, near Oso, Washington, killing 43 people. The slide displaced about 8 million m3 of sand and silt from a 200-m high glacial terrace destroying 40 homes and burying more than 1.0 km of State Route 530. The landslide temporarily dammed the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River flooding an area of about 1.4 km2. The unusually long travel distance, in excess of 700 m from the base of the slope, and apparent speed of the slide led to the great loss of life and destruction. Landslide science was critical in supporting the response to the disaster. Landslide monitoring, process understanding, pre- and post-event high-resolution digital topography, and numerical simulations were used to advise search operations. Recognizing that buildings and their contents were swept tens to hundreds of meters from their original locations, maps of deposit thickness, and estimates of landslide trajectories were used to develop safer and more efficient search strategies. Teams of county, state, and federal scientists, engineers, and specialists were formed to assess the stability of the landslide dam and to monitor stream flow and the level of the lake impounded by the slide, and to assess the geomorphic response of the river to the landslide for gauging future effects on flood hazards and aquatic ecosystems. Another scientific team assessed the threat of additional landslide activity to search operations. This team’s activities included establishing a communications protocol among landslide watch officers and search operations, deploying instrument platforms developed for use on volcanoes (Spiders) to remotely detect ground movement by means of GPS technology and to detect vibrations indicative of landslide movement using seismometers. The team was responsible for monitoring and integrating data from the Spiders and other instruments and making determinations with regards to the potential for additional landsliding during daylight hours, 7 days a week, until the conclusion of active search operations on 28 April 2014. Landslide understanding, data collected prior to and during the response, and modeling results were critical for informing search operations, decision makers, and the community.",

            "abstract": "Characteristic differences in delta morphology suggest different balances of wave, tidal, and fluvial processes on different coastlines. These insights have been used to interpret stratigraphic deposits and reconstruct paleogeography of ancient fluvial-deltaic environments. This work is often accomplished through combined efforts to map the architecture of ancient delta deposits and document the abundance and distribution of sedimentary structures that indicate sediment transport by uni- or bi-directional currents or waves. Statistical tools for quantifying sedimentation patterns in ancient deposits provide an opportunity to directly compare architectural patterns among ancient delta deposits. In order to evaluate the degree to which interpreted influence of waves or tides is manifested as a change in delta architecture, we compare detailed stratigraphic measurements from ancient deposits. Well-studied Cretaceous deltaic deposits in the Western Interior Seaway (USA), including the Ferron and Sego formations, have been interpreted as reflecting wave- and tide-influenced conditions, respectively. Using measurements made in the field and from terrestrial lidar outcrop scans, we compare the compensation index and paleohydraulic reconstructions from distributary channel deposits in order to quantify sedimentary architecture in each unit. Preliminary results suggest that the scaling and architecture of topset, foreset, and prodelta deposits in each of these units may have been broadly similar, despite distinct differences in the abundance of wave- and tidal-indicators present within each unit. This indicates that the presence of traditionally diagnostic deposits, particularly sedimentary structures indicative of fluvial, tidal, or wave processes, may not accurately reflect the balance of these processes acting on paleo-shorelines.",

            "abstract": "The richness of the deep-time record and its potential for revealing important characteristics of ancient fluvial landscapes has been demonstrated time and again, including compelling examples of rivers altering their behavior in response to changes in vegetation patterns or abrupt shifts in water and sediment discharge. At present, reconstructions of ancient river and floodplain dynamics are commonly qualitative, and when quantitative metrics are used, it is often for comparison among ancient deposits. Without being able to reconstruct, more comprehensively, important aspects of ancient river and floodplains dynamics, this information has only anecdotal relevance for evaluating and managing present-day landscapes. While methods for reconstructing hydrodynamic and morphodynamic aspects of ancient rivers and floodplains are useful, uncertainties associated with these snapshots complicate the ability to translate observations from geologic to engineering scales, thereby limiting the utility of insight from Earth’s past in decision-making and development of sustainable landscape-management practices for modern fluvial landscapes. Here, we explore the degree to which paleomorphodynamic reconstructions from ancient channel and floodplain deposits can be used to make specific, quantitative inferences about ancient river dynamics. We compare a suite of paleoenvironmental measurements from a variety of ancient fluvial deposits (including reconstructions of paleoflow depth, paleoslope, paleo-channel mobility, the caliber of paleo-sediment load, and paleo-floodplain heterogeneity) in an effort to evaluate sampling and empirical uncertainties associated with these methods and identify promising avenues for developing more detailed landscape reconstructions. This work is aimed at helping to develop strategies for extracting practicable information from the stratigraphic record that is relevant for sustainably managing and predicting changes in today’s environments.",

            "abstract": "The specific rheology of the lithosphere that allows the existence of plate tectonics on Earth is poorly understood. This rheology must explain why plate tectonics initiated on Earth but not on Venus, which has very similar size and gravity, but also how changes in plate motion can occur on time scales more rapid than that of the deeper convection (~100 myrs). We suggest that a key ingredient of this rheology is the coupling of the grain size evolution of the polycrystalline rocks that constitute the mantle, with the flow. We demonstrate this process using a grain evolution and damage mechanism (Bercovici and Ricard, 2012) with a composite rheology, which are compatible with field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that the grain size is controlled by an dynamic equilibrium where deformation tends to reduce the grain sizes which otherwise would spontaneously increase. The presence of secondary phases is crucial as it eases the grain size reduction and inhibits their too fast recoveries. The resulting time-dependent rheology is non-linear, leads to localisation on time scales much shorter than those of the typical transit time of mantle convection but has also a long healing time. These characteristics of fast damage and long term memory is shown in simple models to spontaneously generate plates on a planet with Earth's parameters. For Venus hotter surface conditions, accumulation and inheritance of damage is negligible; hence only subduction zones survive and plate tectonics does not spread. This rheology also explains how subducting slabs can be rapidly detached when a buoyant crust is drawn into subduction and therefore how rapid plate changes can occur.",

The NDMC is a national center founded in 1995 and located at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The NDMC conducts basic and applied research, provides a variety of services and produces decision support applications. In addition, the NDMC is involved heavily in education, outreach and planning activities and maintains a number of operational drought-related tools and products including the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), Drought Impact Reporter (DIR), Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI) and the Drought Risk Atlas (DRA).\nThe NDMC’s recently launched Drought Risk Atlas (DRA) (http://droughtatlas.unl.edu) and the continually evolving U.S. Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu;) will be the focus of this presentation. The DRA was launched in 2014 in order to help better answer the common questions of “How does this drought compare to the Dust Bowl years or some other regional drought of record?”, or “How often do we see a drought as severe as this?”, and “Are we seeing trends in drought frequency?”. Access to new digital data sources, geospatial tools and analyses, and dissemination through a web-based interface has allowed us to triple the original National Drought Atlas station sample size and roughly double the period of record in standing up the new DRA. Building off of feedback from the user community, the SPI, SPEI, PDSI, self-calibrated PDSI, Deciles and other climatology (to also include hydrology) products are included. It is anticipated that this tool will heighten awareness and enhance decision support activities with regards to drought risk for policy makers, resource managers, producers, planners, media and the public. Examples of the DRA’s data, maps and visualization tools built into the freely accessible web interface will be discussed. In addition, a brief history of the USDM will also be given as an overview to the process along with a look back at its growth and applications to date, including other regions of the globe.",

The task is to estimate spatiotemporally distributed estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) in snow-dominated mountain environments, including those that lack on-the-ground measurements. Several independent methods exist, but all are problematic.\nThe remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow from each pixel can be combined with a calculation of melt to reconstruct the accumulated SWE for each day back to the last significant snowfall. Comparison with streamflow measurements in mountain ranges where such data are available shows this method to be accurate, but the big disadvantage is that SWE can only be calculated retroactively after snow disappears, and even then only for areas with little accumulation during the melt season.\nPassive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several issues, notably signal loss in wet snow or in forests, saturation in deep snow, subpixel variability in the mountains owing to the large (~25 km) pixel size, and SWE overestimation in the presence of large grains such as depth and surface hoar.\nThroughout the winter and spring, snow-covered area can be measured at sub-km spatial resolution with optical sensors, with accuracy and timeliness improved by interpolating and smoothing across multiple days.\nSo the question is, how can we establish the relationship between Reconstruction—available only after the snow goes away—and passive microwave and optical data to accurately estimate SWE during the snow season, when the information can help forecast spring runoff? Linear regression provides one answer, but can modern machine learning techniques (used to persuade people to click on web advertisements) adapt to improve forecasts of floods and droughts in areas where more than one billion people depend on snowmelt for their water resources?",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the world’s largest natural source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The strong sensitivity of these emissions to environmental factors such as soil temperature and moisture has led to concerns about potential positive feedbacks to climate change. This is particularly true at high latitudes, which have experienced pronounced warming and where thawing permafrost could potentially liberate large amounts of labile carbon over this century. Despite the importance of wetland methane emissions to the global carbon cycle and climate dynamics, global models exhibit little agreement as to the magnitude and spatial distribution of emissions, due to uncertainties in both wetland area and emissions per unit area driven by a scarcity of in situ observations. Recent intensive field campaigns across West Siberia make this an ideal region over which to assess the performance of large-scale process-based wetland models in a high-latitude environment. Here we present the results of a follow-up to the Wetland and Wetland CH4 Model Intercomparison Project focused on the West Siberian Lowland (WETCHIMP-WSL). We assessed 17 models and 5 inversions over this domain in terms of total CH4 emissions, simulated wetland areas, and CH4 fluxes per unit wetland area and compared these results to an intensive in situ CH4 flux dataset, several wetland maps, and two satellite inundation products. Findings include: a) estimates of total CH4 emissions from both models and inversions spanned almost an order of magnitude; b) forward models using inundation alone to estimate wetland areas suffered from severe biases in CH4 emissions; and c) aside from these area-driven biases, disagreement in flux per unit wetland area was the main driver of forward model uncertainty. We examine which forward model approaches are best suited towards simulating high-latitude wetlands and make recommendations for future modeling, remote sensing, and field campaigns to reduce model uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "In situ observations from the DMSP and Demeter satellites established that high-power HF heating of the ionosphere F-region results in significant ion outflows associated with 10-30% density enhancements in the topside ionosphere magnetically-conjugate to the heated region. As follows from the SAMI2 two-fluid model calculations, their formation time should exceed 5-7 minutes. However, specially designed DMSP-HAARP experiments have shown that artificial ducts and ion outflows appear on the topside within 2 minutes. We describe the results of these observations and present a semi-quantitative explanation of the fast timescale due to suprathermal electrons accelerated by HF-induced plasma turbulence. There are two possible effects of suprathermal electrons: (1) the increase of the ambipolar electric field over the usual thermal ambipolar diffusion and (2) excitation of heat flux-driven plasma instability resulting in an anomalous electron-ion momentum exchange. Both effects result in faster upward ion flows.",

            "abstract": "The European Space Agency’s (ESA) CryoSat mission and NASA’s airborne Operation IceBridge observe large-scale, regional and temporal changes of sea ice thickness in the Arctic by means of radar and laser altimetry. Unfortunately, snow thickness variability and scaling issues at all scales from meters to hundreds of kilometers remain some of the main sources of error for altimetric sea ice thickness retrievals. To address this gap, extensive coincident airborne and in-situ ice and snow measurements were performed as part of the CryoSat Validation Experiment in March and April 2014 (CryoVEx 2014). In-situ ice and snow thickness measurements were performed at four locations representative of various Arctic ice and snow conditions. Two sites were located in first year ice near Barrow, Alaska; one was in the Canadian Beaufort Sea’s thin multiyear ice; and one was in thick multiyear ice situated north of Greenland. All four sites were overflown by a number of aircraft equipped with various ice and snow thickness sensors that captured ice and snow property variations. At our field sites, ice thickness, surface roughness, and snow thickness measurements were performed along 2 km transects. Centered on these transects were 60 m x 400 m intensive snow measurement grids with 5 m x 5 m point spacings and nested 60 m x 100 m grids with 1 m x 1 m point spacings. These snow thickness measurements were acquired to study the two-dimensional variability and to provide information on scales comparable to or exceeding the footprint sizes of airborne snow thickness radars operated by NASA and ESA. Here we present results of these snow and ice thickness measurements to shed light on the large- and small-scale spatial variability of these properties across the Arctic. In addition, we present first results from initial comparisons with the airborne and satellite snow and ice thickness retrievals.",

However, the recently released Next Generation Science Standards place a strong emphasis on Earth sciences, and suggests that a full-year, high school course is necessary if we, as a nation, are to address our long-term environmental issues. One obstacle to such an effort is that there are a limited number of curricula that address hydrologic concepts for secondary-school students.

            "abstract": "Earth observation satellites collect a broad variety of data used in applications that range from weather forecasting to climate monitoring. Within NOAA the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) supports these applications by operating satellites in both geosynchronous and polar orbits. Traditionally NESDIS has acquired and operated its satellites as stand-alone systems with their own command and control, mission management, processing, and distribution systems. As the volume, velocity, veracity, and variety of sensor data and products produced by these systems continues to increase, NESDIS is migrating to a new concept of operation in which it will operate and sustain the ground infrastructure as an integrated Enterprise. Based on a series of common ground services, the Ground Enterprise Architecture System (GEARS) approach promises greater agility, flexibility, and efficiency at reduced cost. This talk describes the new architecture and associated development activities, and presents the results of initial efforts to improve product processing and distribution.",

            "abstract": "In the emergent “fourth paradigm” (data-driven) science, the scientific method is enhanced by the integration of significant data sources into the practice of scientific research. To address Big Science, there are challenges in understanding the role of data in enabling researchers to attack not just disciplinary issues, but also the system-level, large-scale, and transdisciplinary global scientific challenges facing society.\nRecognizing that the volume of data is only one of many dimensions to be considered, there is a clear need for improved data infrastructures to mediate data and information exchange, which we contend will need to be powered by semantic technologies. One clear need is to provide computational approaches for researchers to discover appropriate data resources, rapidly integrate data collections from heterogeneously resources or multiple data sets, and inter-compare results to allow generation and validation of hypotheses. Another trend is toward automated tools that allow researchers to better find and reuse data that they currently don’t know they need, let alone know how to find. Again semantic technologies will be required. Finally, to turn data analytics from \"art to science\", technical solutions are needed for cross-dataset validation, reproducibility studies on data-driven results, and the concomitant citation of data products allowing recognition for those who curate and share important data resources.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 346 (Asian Monsoon) tested the hypothesis that Plio-Pleistocene uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, and/or emergence and growth of the northern hemisphere ice sheets and establishment of the two discrete modes of Westerly Jet circulation, is the cause of the millennial-scale variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and ampliﬁcation of Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. We also examined whether the nature and strength of flow through the Tsushima Strait (which is strongly affected by EASM precipitation, sea level changes, and EAWM cooling) influenced surface and deepwater conditions of the Japan, Yamato, and Ulleung Basins.\nDuring only six weeks of drilling, Expedition 346 recovered 6135.3 m of core, which established an IODP record for the amount of recovered material. Because of recent advances in drilling technology and newly developed analytical tools, we were able to examine records that were impossible to acquire even a few years ago. The newly engineered half piston core system recovered the deepest piston core in DSDP/ODP/IODP history (490.4 m in Hole U1427A), which was reached by continuous piston coring from the seafloor.\nThese advances delivered new surprises. We recovered pristine dark-light laminae from approximately 8 Ma sediment from 275 m below the seaﬂoor at Site U1425 (Yamato Rise) and from 210 m below the seafloor (10-12 Ma) at Site U1430 in the Ulleung Basin. Aggressive sampling for geochemistry provided important constraints on the diagenetic and chemical environments throughout these marginal seas, and yet did not negatively compromise paleoceanographic objectives. We are extending earlier pioneering results of the Quaternary dark and light layers in these basins and which record variations of EASM precipitation over South China. Drilling in the East China Sea is providing an excellent record of EASM precipitation because its surface water salinity and temperature during summer is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by Yangtze River discharge. Ash records are providing calibrated stratigraphic control and improving understanding of arc history. Interpreting these and other results in the context of other IODP drilling expeditions, such as Expedition 349 to the South China Sea, will be critical to develop a holistic understanding of the Asian monsoon system.",

            "abstract": "While the majority of the Earth surface is still in pristine conditions, the totality of the hydrological systems that are relevant to humans are human impacted, with the only exception of small headwater catchments. In fact, the limited transferability of water in space and time implies that water withdrawals from natural resources take place where and when water is needed. Therefore, hydrological systems are impacted where and when humans are, thereby causing a direct perturbation of all water bodies that are relevant to society. The current trend of population dynamics and the current status of water systems are such that the above impact will be not sustainable in the near future, therefore causing a water emergency that will be extended to all intensively populated regions of the world, with relevant implications on migration fluxes, political status and social security. Therefore mitigation actions are urgently needed, whose planning needs to be based on improved interpretations of the above impact. Up to recent times, hydrologists mainly concentrated their research on catchments where the human perturbation is limited, to improve our understanding of pristine hydrology. There were good motivations for this focus: given the relevant uncertainty affecting hydrological modeling, and the even greater uncertainty involved in societal modeling, hydrologists made an effort to separate hydrological and human dynamics. Nowadays, the urgency of the above need to mitigate the global water crisis through improved water resources management calls for a research attempt to bridge water and social sciences. The relevant research question is how to build operational models in order to fully account for the interactions and feedbacks between water resources systems and society. Given that uncertainty estimation is necessary for the operational application of model results, one of the crucial issues is how to quantify uncertainty by means of suitable assumptions. This talk will provide an introduction to the problem and a personal perspective to move forward to set up improved operational models to assist societal planning to mitigate the global water crisis.",

            "abstract": "Reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause is the mechanism by which magnetic fields in different regions change topology to create open magnetic field lines that allow energy and momentum to flow into the magnetosphere. The location of the reconnection line at the magnetopause depends on the conditions of the solar wind, especially the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Dayside equatorial region locations of reconnection during southward IMF have been inferred from global ionospheric images and studies based on incident ion beams in the cusp and boundary layer of the magnetopause. For such conditions the most likely location is along the line of Maximum Magnetic Shear crossing the magnetopause (for large IMF BY cases) or along the high latitude antiparallel reconnection region (for large IMF BX or BZ cases). The same studies have also revealed a poleward of the cusp reconnection line for northward IMF conditions.\nIn this study we discuss several cusp crossings by the Polar satellite during conditions with a weak northward IMF component for which cusp ion-energy dispersion profiles typical for a equatorial dayside reconnection line have been observed. This dayside reconnection location during northward IMF conditions is also inferred from magnetopause crossings of the Double-Star satellites.",

            "abstract": "Domestic and open biomass burning are poorly-understood, major influences on Earth’s atmosphere composed of countless individual fires that (along with their products) are difficult to quantify spatially and temporally. Each fire is a minimally-controlled complex phenomenon producing a diverse suite of gases and aerosols that experience many different atmospheric processing scenarios. New lab, airborne, and space-based observations along with model and algorithm development are significantly improving our knowledge of biomass burning. Several campaigns provided new detailed emissions profiles for previously undersampled fire types; including wildfires, cooking fires, peat fires, and agricultural burning; which may increase in importance with climate change and rising population. Multiple campaigns have better characterized black and brown carbon and used new instruments such as high resolution PTR-TOF-MS and 2D-GC/TOF-MS to improve quantification of semi-volatile precursors to aerosol and ozone. The aerosol evolution and formation of PAN and ozone, within hours after emission, have now been measured extensively. The NASA DC-8 sampled smoke before and after cloud-processing in two campaigns. The DC-8 performed continuous intensive sampling of a wildfire plume from the source in California to Canada probing multi-day aerosol and trace gas aging. Night-time plume chemistry has now been measured in detail. Fire inventories are being compared and improved, as is modeling of mass transfer between phases and sub-grid photochemistry for global models.",

            "abstract": "Growing Degree Vegetation Production Index (GDVPI) is a parametric approach to delimiting vegetation seasonal growth and decline cycles using incremental growing degree days (GDD), and NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) 8-day composite cumulative integral data. We obtain a specific location’s daily minimum and maximum temperatures from the nearest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather stations posted on the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) Climate Data Online (CDO) archive and compute GDD. The date range for this study is January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2012. We employ a novel process, a repeating logistic product (RLP), to compensate for short-term weather variability and data drops from the recording stations and fit a curve to the median daily GDD values, adjusting for asymmetry, amplitude, and phase shift that minimize the sum of squared errors when comparing the observed and predicted GDD. The resulting curve, here referred to as the surrogate GDD, is the time-temperature phasing parameter used to convert Cartesian NDVI values into polar coordinate pairs, multiplying the NDVI values as the radial by the cosine and sine of the surrogate GDD as the angular. Depending on the vegetation type and the original NDVI curve, the polar NDVI curve may be nearly circular, kidney-shaped, or pear-shaped in the case of conifers, deciduous, or agriculture, respectively. We examine the points of tangency about the polar coordinate NDVI curve, identifying values of 1, 0, -1, or infinity, as each of these represent natural inflection points. Lines connecting the origin to each tangent point illustrate and quantify the parametrically segmentation of the growing season based on the GDD and NDVI ostensible dependency. Furthermore, the area contained by each segment represents the apparent vegetation production. A particular benefit is that the inflection points are determined near real-time, as MODIS NDVI, 8-day composite data become available, affording an effective forecasting and hindcasting tool.",

            "abstract": "Cenozoic paleoclimate reconstructions of China, based on pollens, fossils and sedimentary deposits, show a change from planetary aridity to inland aridity of NW China by the early Miocene. However, the initiation of this paleoclimate transition is not well-documented and might be much earlier. The surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, the retreat of the Para-Tethys sea, and global cooling have all been suggested to influence the establishment of this inland aridity, although their relative significance remains obscure. This paper presents a stable isotope study of a 4435 m long sedimentary section from the western Qaidam Basin, northern Tibetan Plateau, that spans from the late middle Eocene to late Miocene. The lowermost and uppermost parts of the section are dominated by fluvial and alluvial fan deposits, while the majority of the middle of the section represents palustrine, lower fan delta and marginal to shallow lacustrine fine-grained sediments intercalated with coarse sandstone and conglomerate. Our isotope data show sporadic aridity events in the late middle Eocene to early Oligocene, which might mark the transition from planetary aridity to, or the initiation of, inland aridity in NW China, due to the retreat of the Para-Tethys sea, a process that might be significantly influenced by the early topographic growth of the south-central Tibetan Plateau. A negative shift in oxygen isotope values around 19 Ma is also in accordance with other geological evidence suggesting the Oligocene–early Miocene growth of the Kunlun mountains south of the Qaidam basin. Later intensification of aridity occurred at ~12 Ma that corresponds with a regional climate change event, which we attribute to the upward and outward growth of the northern Tibetan Plateau. The final establishment of extreme inland aridity that is comparable to present day was most likely established at ~3.1–2.6 Ma in the Qaidam basin, and therefore global cooling and northern hemisphere glaciation is a major candidate for the cause.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing contraction related to the regional-scale left step in the San Andreas fault, (i.e. the Big Bend) has resulted in a complex network of oblique-reverse slip faults that now accommodate shortening across the Ventura basin. Continuous GPS sites from the Plate Boundary Observatory measure horizontal contraction rates across the Ventura basin of approximately 7 mm/yr oriented north-northwest with rates decreasing to the west and east. Inversion of horizontal GPS velocities highlights a zone of localized fast horizontal contraction rates that roughly follow the Ventura basin where seismic velocity models show low modulus sediments. This pattern of localized horizontal contraction can be explained with simple models creeping reverse faults (edge dislocations) at depth; however, such models predict significant uplift gradients that are not observed in the GPS or InSAR data. In fact, the GPS and InSAR show almost no vertical strains in the regions that exhibit fast horizontal strains. Thus, the outstanding unanswered question in the region is: how can interseismic deformation in a contractional setting produce localized horizontal contraction with little to no uplift gradients?\nTo assess whether the simple models are inadequate in their fault geometry, we use a complex interseismic mechanical model incorporating three-dimensional, nonplanar, and geologically constrained fault surfaces from the Southern California Earthquake Center’s Community Fault Model (CFM). This model produces very little vertical strains, but cannot match the magnitudes and localization of fast horizontal strains, likely due to the modeled homogeneous rock stiffness. In the end, we suggest that it is possible that a significant portion of the horizontal strains are due to strain localization in the low modulus sediments of the Ventura basin, which may not be released in a future earthquake and potentially mask the interseismic deformation due to faulting. Additionally, the CFM-based model suggests that many faults in the region may have no interseismic signal at all since several faults merge with other faults above their locking depth. Thus, interseismic satellite geodesy may not be able to characterize all potential seismic sources.",

            "abstract": "Understanding eddy-mean flow interactions is a long-standing problem in geophysical fluid dynamics with modern relevance to the task of representing eddy effects in coarse resolution models while preserving their dependence on the underlying dynamics of the flow field. Exploiting the recognition that the velocity covariance matrix/eddy stress tensor that describes eddy fluxes, also encodes information about eddy size, shape and orientation through its geometric representation in the form of the so-called variance ellipse, suggests a potentially fruitful way forward.\nHere we present a new framework that describes eddy-mean flow interactions in terms of a geometric description of the eddy motion, and illustrate it with an application to an unstable jet. Specifically we show that the eddy vorticity flux divergence F, a key dynamical quantity describing the average effect of fluctuations on the time-mean flow, may be decomposed into two components with distinct geometric interpretations: 1. variations in variance ellipse orientation; and 2. variations in the anisotropic part of the eddy kinetic energy, a function of the variance ellipse size and shape. Application of the divergence theorem shows that F integrated over a region is explained entirely by variations in these two quantities around the region’s periphery.\nThis framework has the potential to offer new insights into eddy-mean flow interactions in a number of ways. It identifies the ingredients of the eddy motion that have a mean flow forcing effect, it links eddy effects to spatial patterns of variance ellipse geometry that can suggest the mechanisms underpinning these effects, and finally it illustrates the importance of resolving eddy shape and orientation, and not just eddy size/energy, to accurately represent eddy feedback effects. These concepts will be both discussed and illustrated.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of magma and hydrothermal fluids at restless calderas is important for many reasons. The interplay between the magmatic and hydrothermal systems at caldera-forming volcanoes is key to interpreting many of the geophysical signals measured at the surface used to understand their subsurface state and structure. Several recent studies have highlighted that structural controls may be important in terms of the movements of both types of fluids in the Earth’s crust below volcanoes with implications including hazard management and geothermal prospecting. Caldera-forming systems are often characterized by eruptive activity covering a wide range of size scales and repose intervals. Understanding how these different scales of volcanism at the same system relate to each other is a key science challenge when seeking to understand these types of volcano. This presentation will explore these issues using examples from two caldera-forming systems. Santorini volcano in Greece is a relatively well-studied system that last erupted significantly about 75 years ago and has recently experienced a period of unusual unrest. Aluto volcano in Ethiopia is more poorly studied but has been shown to be actively deforming and is an area of focus for investment in geothermal power in the Main Ethiopian Rift. In each case lessons from field mapping and geochemistry, high-resolution digital elevation models, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and degassing surveys and compositions can be brought together to yield insights into the behavior of these and similar volcanic systems.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which particular extreme weather and climate events are assessed as being attributable to anthropogenic climate change (e.g., that anthropogenic forcing influenced their probability of occurrence or other characteristics) can vary dramatically from case to case.\nOne example assessed at GFDL is the record or near-record annual mean temperature over a large region of Australia in 2013. According to this analysis of the CMIP5 models, the event was largely attributable to anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. Another 2013 case was the extreme positive annual mean precipitation anomalies in 5x5 degree gridded (GHCN) precipitation data that were observed along the U.S./Canadian border region. This is a region with a detectable long-term increase of precipitation since 1900. Nonetheless, the 2013 event is assessed as primarily attributable to internal (unforced) climate variability and only partly attributable to external forcing (natural and anthropogenic combined). There are many outstanding challenges to these studies. Among these are the limitations to historical data length, data quality, model ensemble size, and model control run length. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in addressing model biases, station/gridcell scale mismatches, modeling the extreme ends of the distributions e.g. with Generalized Extreme Value methods, etc.\nAnother project assesses anthropogenic influences on the track and evolution (but not the likelihood) of Sandy-like storms. Assuming the existence of a Sandy-like storm under non-industrial conditions, we use CMIP5 model simulations, a global atmospheric model time slice experiment, and regional hurricane model idealized simulations to suggest that the unusual left turn the storm took may have been made more likely by anthropogenic climate forcing. This does not imply that Sandy-like events are less likely in the non-industrial climate, because we assumed the existence of such a storm to begin with.",

            "abstract": "Plasma density structures and associated irregularities in the nighttime midlatitude ionosphere are frequently observed as frontal structures elongated from northwest to southeast (NW-SE) in the Northern Hemisphere with a wavelength of 100-200 km, also known as medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs). The MSTIDs and the coupling process between the E and F regions are studied with a midlatitude ionosphere electrodynamics coupling (MIECO) model which can simulate two instability mechanisms: Perkins instability in the F region and sporadic-E (Es)-layer instability in the E region. Using the MIECO model, MSTID structure is reproduced from random perturbation on an Es layer in a wide horizontal coverage. A typical wavelength of ~150 km, larger amplitude, and smaller MSTID's tilt angles at lower latitudes are consistent with observations. It is shown that the polarization process in the E region driven by neutral winds is essentially important for the full development of MSTIDs as well as the seeding of NW-SE perturbation in the F region. The upgraded version of MIECO model comprises both hemispheres where electric field is solved by integrating conductivities in both hemispheres, and all other parameters such as plasma density and neutral wind are independent. In order to study the scale dependence of MSTIDs, the initial perturbation scale on the Es layer is given from 20 km to 320 km range. The results show that shorter scale perturbation tends to saturate faster both at the E and F regions, whereas the Es-layer instability does not work effectively at very long wavelength mode. As a result, the typical wavelength of MSTIDs (100-200 km) can be spontaneously generated without scale-dependent forcing.",

            "abstract": "Time is a central concept in geoscience. Geologic histories are composed of sequences of geologic processes and events. Calibration of their timing ties a local history into a broader context, and enables correlation of events between locations. The geologic timescale is standardized in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, which specifies interval names, and calibrations for the ages of the interval boundaries.\nTime is also a key concept in the world at large. A number of general purpose temporal ontologies have been developed, both stand-alone and as parts of general purpose or upper ontologies. A temporal ontology for geoscience should apply or extend a suitable general purpose temporal ontology.\nHowever, geologic time presents two challenges:\nGeology involves greater spans of time than in other temporal ontologies, inconsistent with the year-month-day/hour-minute-second formalization that is a basic assumption of most general purpose temporal schemes;\nThe geologic timescale is a temporal topology. Its calibration in terms of an absolute (numeric) scale is a scientific issue in its own right supporting a significant community. In contrast, the general purpose temporal ontologies are premised on exact numeric values for temporal position, and do not allow for temporal topology as a primary structure.\nWe have developed an ontology for the geologic timescale to account for these concerns. It uses the ISO 19108 distinctions between different types of temporal reference system, also linking to an explicit temporal topology model. Stratotypes used in the calibration process are modelled as sampling-features following the ISO 19156 Observations and Measurements model.\nA joint OGC-W3C harmonization project is underway, with standardization of the W3C OWL-Time ontology as one of its tasks. The insights gained from the geologic timescale ontology will assist in development of a general ontology capable of modelling a richer set of use-cases from geoscience.",

An overview of the methodology and a summary of applications will be given.\nPost-processing of GCM forecasts is often necessary for the outputs to be more informative. CBaM attempts to maximise the value of GCM outputs by not only post-processing the variable of interest (calibration), but also using other available outputs such as sea surface temperatures to generate forecasts (bridging). Merging forecasts from calibration and bridging models leads to the opportunity to improve forecasting skill for some regions and time periods.\nIn CBaM, separate calibration and bridging models are established using a Bayesian joint probability modelling approach. The models generate forecasts in the form of ensembles. Forecasts from multiple calibration and bridging models are merged using Bayesian model averaging. Ensemble time series forecasts are produced by sequencing ensemble members using the Schaake Shuffle.\nResults to date are presented for a number of applications. The method is applied to produce gridded rainfall forecasts for Australia and China, using outputs from single or multiple GCMs. It is also applied to produce monthly forecasts of catchment rainfall for up to 12 months in advance. Monthly forecasts of catchment rainfall are used in a hydrological model to forecast streamflow for up to 12 months. CBaM forecasts are shown to extract skill from the atmospheric and oceanic modules of the GCM, and are also shown to be reliable.\nWork is in progress to apply CBaM to forecasts of other climate variables, including temperature, and to combine forecasts from multiple GCMs, including the ECMWF System 4 and NCEP CFSv2 models.",

            "abstract": "Past physics-based models of slow slip events (SSE) have shown that, when averaged over many SSE cycles, the shear stress within the SSE zone remains roughly constant. Stress accumulates between SSE, and then is released during slow slip events. However, the predicted long-term deformation rates from such models, assuming the plate boundary is locked to the top of the ETS zone, do not fit well GPS velocities and uplift rates determined from leveling and tide-gauge data. These physics-based models particularly misfit the vertical rates. At the same time, previous kinematic inversions display a gap between the down-dip limit of the locked region and the top of the ETS zone.\nOur inversions of geodetic data for fault slip rates exhibit a steeper slip-rate profile at the top of the ETS zone, relative to the constant shear stress model, as well as creep up dip of the ETS zone. We explore physics-based models with velocity-strengthening regions of different length up dip the ETS zone, i.e. within the “gap” identified in kinematic inversions. However, this still does not match the observations well. We therefore try a new approach: we invert for shear stress rates on the megathrust that best fit the data. We show that a small decrease in shear stress within the top of the ETS zone, reaching 5 kPa/year at a depth of ~ 30 km, is required to fit the data. Possible explanations for this include a slow decrease in normal stress with time, possibly due to an increase in pore pressure, or a reduction in fault friction. We explore these hypotheses, using 2D quasi-dynamic simulations with rate-and-state friction and isothermal v-cutoff models for generating slow slip events. The potential for creep above the top of the ETS zone has important implications for the mechanical relationship between deep slow slip and dynamic events in the locked region.",

            "abstract": "Much interpretation in units of the National Park System, conducted by National Park Service (NPS) rangers and partners today is done in a didactic, lecture style. This “one-way” communication runs counter to research suggesting that long-term impacts of park interpretive experiences must be established through direct connections with the visitor. Previous research in interpretation has suggested that interpretive experiences utilizing a “two-way” dialogue approach are more successful at facilitating long-term memories than “one-way” approaches where visitors have few, if any, opportunities to ask questions, offer opinions, or share interests and experiences. Long-term memories are indicators of connections to places and resources.\nGlobal anthropogenic change poses critical threats to NPS sites, resources, and visitor experiences. As climate change plays an ever-expanding role in public, political, social, economic, and environmental discourse it stands to reason that park visitors may also be interested in engaging in this discourse. Indeed, NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis stated in the agency’s Climate Change Action Plan 2012 – 2014 that, “We now know through social science conducted in parks that our visitors are looking to NPS staff for honest dialogue about this critical issue.\"\nResearchers from Indiana University will present preliminary findings from a multiple park study that assessed basic visitor knowledge and the impact of two-way interpretation related to climate change. Observations from park interpretive program addressing climate change will be presented. Basic visitor knowledge of climate change impacts in the select parks as well as immediate and long-term visitor recollections will be presented. Select units of the National Park System in this research included Cape Cod National Seashore, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Cascades National Park, Shenandoah National Park, and Zion National Park.

            "abstract": "Uplifted coral terraces throughout the Banda-Sunda Arc transition reveal how strain is distributed over the past thousand to million years in the active arc-continent collision, and are key to identifying hazardous active faults. U-series age analysis of the lowest coral terraces yields surface uplift rates that vary in a non-systematic way along strike from 0.2 to 1.5 mm/a over short wavelengths of a few kms. For example, coral terraces are tilted varying degrees northward in Sumba, SSE in Savu, NNW in Rote and generally south along the north coast of Timor. In all of these cases the tilt is away from zones of active thrusting and folding. In Sumba the forearc is ramping up and over the northern edge of the Scott Plateau along what is likely a north dipping thrust. In Savu the coral terraces rise where the back of the accretionary wedge is ramping up over the forearc basin on the south dipping Savu Thrust. In Rote coral terraces form on the front of the accretionary wedge where it is ramping up over the subducting Australian continental margin. The north coast of East Timor is likely uplifting due to internal thrusting and closure of the Wetar Strait. Localized uplift of circular islands is associated with diapirism. The diapiric island of Kisar is cored by syn-collisional metamorphic rocks.\nThe association of uplift and warping with short wavelength deformational processes argues against the commonly held interpretation that coral terraces in the Banda arc-continent collision manifest the effects of slab tear or some other lithospheric scale process. The pattern of uplift correlates best with proximity to active faults, folds and diapirs.\nIn terms of geohazards, flights of uplifted coral terraces are the smoking gun for sources of large earthquakes and tsunami. Many of the terraces show signs of co-seismic uplift. Tsunami deposits with young corals are found on some of these terraces as high as 20 m above sea level.",

            "abstract": "Boreal forests occupy latitudes that are experiencing the greatest rates of warming on earth, a pattern that is expected to continue over the coming decades. Much of the Boreal is underlain by permafrost, which can be expected to have important consequences for forest structure, composition and functioning as the climate warms. The southern margin of permafrost is especially susceptible to warming, since in this region, the permafrost is discontinuous, relatively thin, warm and ice-rich. In the discontinuous permafrost zone, permafrost often forms the physical foundation on which trees develop, forming tree-covered peat plateaus where trees contribute to permafrost maintenance and aggradation processes through reductions in radiation load and changes in snow accumulation. Forests are restricted to peat plateaus while wetland communities occupy intervening permafrost-free areas. The extent and distribution of each land cover type is an important determinant of how boreal forest-wetland landscapes in the discontinuous permafrost zone function as part of the climate system. Climate warming is rapidly thawing permafrost leading to ground surface subsidence and transformation of the forests into wetlands, increasing both the areal extent and connectivity of the latter. In this presentation, we will use an integrative framework at the ForestGEO Scotty Creek Forest Dynamics Plot site near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada to demonstrate the changes in ecological, hydrological and biosphere-atmosphere interactions within this boreal forest-wetland landscape characterized by rapidly degrading permafrost.",

            "abstract": "Watersheds experiencing land development are constantly evolving, and their biogeochemical signatures are expected to evolve across both space and time in drainage waters. We investigate how land development influences spatial and temporal evolution of the carbon cycle from small streams to major rivers in the Eastern U.S. Along the watershed continuum, we show that there is spatial evolution in: (1) the amount, chemical form, and bioavailability of carbon; (2) carbon retention/release at the reach scale; and (3) ecosystem metabolism of carbon from headwaters to coastal waters. Over shorter time scales, the interaction between land use and climate variability alters magnitude and frequency of carbon \"pulses\" in watersheds. Amounts and forms of carbon pulses in agricultural and urban watersheds respond similarly to climate variability due to headwater alteration and loss of ecosystem services to buffer runoff and temperature changes. Over longer time scales, land use change has altered organic carbon concentrations in tidal waters of Chesapeake Bay, and there have been increased bicarbonate alkalinity concentrations in rivers throughout the Eastern U.S. due to human activities. In summary, our analyses indicates that the form and reactivity of carbon have evolved over space and time along the watershed continuum with major implications for downstream ecosystem metabolism, biological oxygen demand, carbon dioxide production, and river alkalinization.",

            "abstract": "In 2007, the first cap and trade legislation for a catchment nitrogen (N) budget was enacted to protect water quality in New Zealand’s iconic Lake Taupo. The clarity of the 616 km² N-limited oligotrophic lake was declining due to human-induced increases in N losses from the 3,487 km² catchment. Focus was placed on reversing increases in N inputs from agriculture, and to a lesser degree sewerage sources. The legislation imposed a cap equal to 20% reduction in the N inputs to the lake, and enabled trading.\nThe landmark legislation could have failed during appeal. Sources of disagreement included the N budgeting model and grand-parenting method that benchmarked the N leaching of individual farms. The N leaching rates for key land uses were also a major battleground, with strong effects on the viability of trading and relative value of enterprises. Sufficient science was applied to resolve the substantive issues in the appeal by 2008. Crucially, the decision recognized that N inputs to the “N cascade” mattered more than leaching evidence including land-use legacies.\nOther catchment cap-and-trade schemes followed. Rotorua Lakes had already capped inputs and established a ~33% N input reduction target after acceptance of a trading scheme compatible with groundwater lag times. In the Upper Manawatu catchment, a cap-and-trade scheme now governs river N loads in a more typical farming region, with an innovative allocation scheme based on the natural capital of soils.\nCollectively, these schemes have succeeded in imposing a cap, and signaling the intention of reductions over time. I conclude with common themes in the successes, and examine the role of science in the success and ongoing implementation.\nCentral to success has been the role of science in framing N budgets at farm and catchment scales. Long-term data has been invaluable, despite the need to correct biases. Cap-and-trade policies alter future science needs toward reducing uncertainty in overall budgets, the ability to measure success or failure in innovative source reductions at a management scale, and defining quantitative measures of aquatic health. Broadly, the schemes have enabled a culture of innovation, in farming and research. For example, recent evidence suggests it may be possible to flip the Rotorua Lakes into a P limitation regime through alum dosing.",

            "abstract": "Geyser eruption intervals are determined by rates of water and heat discharge into shallow subsurface reservoirs and the conduit. In some geysers, small amounts of water discharge prior to a main eruption ('Preplay') can affect eruption intervals. Water discharge during preplay reduces the hydrostatic pressure, which in turn, induces boiling of water that is at, or near the critical temperature. Ascending steam slugs from depth can also lead to shorter eruption intervals (Namiki et al., 2014). In April 2014, we carried a five day experiment at Lone Star Geyser, Yellowstone National Park. Eruptions and their preplays were recorded with an infrared sensor that measured temperature variations immediately above the geyser cone (3.4~m high), temperature loggers that measured water temperature at the base of the cone and in the outflow channels, and visual observations. At Lone Star Geyser, during the preplay phase of the eruption, mainly liquid water is erupted, whereas the main phase of the eruption begins with the liquid-water dominated eruption and turns into the steam discharge. The temperature rise in an outflow channel indicates the occurrence of preplays and initiation of the main eruption. The acquired data suggests that the preplay patterns of Lone Star Geyser are vigorous and complex, consistent with previous observations (Karlstrom et al., 2013). Our new observations reveal two typical styles: 1) vigorous preplays with few events (<5) and long intervals (>20~minutes) that last approximately 40~minutes, and 2) less vigorous preplays that include several events (>5) with short intervals (few minutes), and continue approximately for one hour. Probability distributions of preplay durations show two peaks indicating the bimodal activity. The bimodality of Lone Star preplays may be a result of subtle change of temperature distribution in a convecting reservoir which has been observed in laboratory experiments (Toramaru and Maeda, 2013).",

            "abstract": "The building of a craton involves the extraction of continental crust from the Earth's mantle and the lateral accretion of juvenile volcanic terranes. Ascertaining which conditions allow a newborn continental assemblage to survive requires information on its mechanical strength, which depends on the amount and vertical distribution of radioactive elements in the crust. There is thus a connection between crust formation mechanisms and a successful amalgamation process.\nTo address outstanding questions concerning Archean cratons, the Superior province in Canada is the perfect region because it contains a well preserved geological record of accretion that provides compelling evidence for plate tectonic processes at 2.7 Ga. At almost the same time, the rate of continental growth decreased significantly, which may result from either slower crust formation or enhanced destruction through erosion and subduction. These issues are linked to the strength of the newborn continent.\nThe extensive heat flow data set now available in the Superior Province reveals a clear demarcation between a chemically depleted and differentiated craton core and weakly differentiated enriched juvenile accreted terranes. The Superior craton was thus made of a strong core surrounded by weak terranes. This dichotomy implies that the accretion process could not involve complex imbrication of the accreted belts into the craton core. Subsequently, the craton may have been protected from convective disruption or delamination by its weak margins. Differences between the craton core and accreted terranes may be due to different crustal extraction processes, such as melting in a mantle plume or magmatism in a subduction zone. If subduction started at about 3 Ga, as advocated by several authors, the assembly and survival of large cratons may well be a consequence of this key shift in mantle activity. Alternatively, the chemical depletion of the craton core may be due to a prolonged history of internal differentiation leading to an enriched upper crust that gets eroded away.",

However, in such datasets and their metadata, significant scientific could be hidden just a few queries below the surface. We will discuss quite possibly the largest astronomical database, the \"EUV Brightpoint Database\", which contains information about over 200 million individual features that are ubiquitously observed in the Sun's corona - EUV Brightpoints (or BPs). While end-point science was not clear in 2002 when the project to catalog the Sun’s BPs in the archive of SOHO's Extreme Ultraviolet Telescope (EIT) images began the impact of those few queries could cause a quite a stir in the field.\nOur systematic analysis of BPs, and the magnetic scale on which they appear to form, allowed us to demonstrate that the landmarks of sunspot cycle 23 could be explained in terms of the evolution and interaction of latitudinally and temporally overlapping bands of magnetic activity. Those bands appear to belong to the Sun’s 22-year magnetic activity cycle. The patterns that these bands make closely match helioseismic inference of the Sun’s torsional oscillation - a signature of rotational anomalies taking place the Sun’s interior. The high-latitude origin and start dates preceding sunspot formation by more than a decade - on the same activity band - pose a significant challenge to our understanding of the processes responsible for the production of the Sun’s quasi-decadal variability.\nWe sincerely doubt that the BP database is alone in containing information of such potential scientific value. Often one just has to get lucky, before being able to formulate the correct queries. We hope that the material presented in this talk can motivate a scientific exploitation of the computer vision databases currently being built from the stunning images of our star in addition to some retrospective investigations.",

This adaptive fusion of information aims to assimilate active (manmade) and passive (natural) hydrologic and geophysical tomography surveys to enhance our ability of seeing into hydrogeological basins at the resolutions of our interests. The active hydrogeophysical tomography refers to recently developed hydraulic tomgoraphic surveys by Chinese and German scientists, as well as well-established geophysical tomography surveys (such as electrical resistivity tomography, cross-borehole radars, electrical magnetic surveys). These active hydrogeophysical tomgoraphic surveys have been proven to be useful high-resolution surveys for geological media of tens and hundreds of meters wide and deep. For basin-scale (i.e., tens and hundreds of kilometers) problems, their applicabilities are however rather limited. The passive hydrogeophysical tomography refers to unexplored technologies that exploit natural stimuli as energy sources for tomographic surveys, which include direct lightning strikes, groundwater level fluctuations due to earthquakes, river stage fluctuations, precipitation storms, barometric pressure variations, and long term climate changes. These natural stimuli are spatially varying, recurrent, and powerful, influencing geological media over great distances and depths (e.g., tens and hundreds of kilometers). Monitoring hydrological and geophysical responses of geological media to these stimuli at different locations is tantamount to collecting data of naturally occurring tomographic surveys. Exploiting natural stimuli as tomographic surveys is a novel concept for cost-effective characterization and monitor of subsurface processes in regional-scale basins at great depths.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic models incorporating crevasse-depth calving laws have enjoyed considerable success in simulating observed behavior of tidewater glaciers. Such models are based on the assumption that longitudinal strain rates exert a first-order control on calving, and that penetration of surface and basal crevasses provides the ultimate constraint on glacier extent. However, ‘second-order’ processes such as melt undercutting may significantly amplify calving rates, initiating seasonal and longer-term glacier retreats. We present high temporal and spatial resolution TerraSAR-X data from Svalbard that indicate a strong annual cycle in calving rates, peaking in September-October coincident with maximum fjord temperatures. This pattern is consistent for all studied glaciers irrespective of glacier activity (fast, slow, surging or quiescent), and we conclude that in Svalbard calving is paced by melt-undercutting followed by mechanical destabilization of the ice tongue.\nAlthough parameterizations of melt undercutting are included in many models employing the crevasse-depth calving criterion, amplification of calving by melt undercutting (the ‘O’Leary Effect’) has not been rigorously analyzed or tested against observations. We take a novel approach to this problem, and couple the finite element model Elmer-Ice with a discrete particle model (DPM) to explore in detail the links between melt undercutting and failure of the ice tongue. Employing glacier front geometries representative of Kronebreen (Svalbard), Columbia Glacier (Alaska) and Helheim Glacier (Greenland), we use Elmer-Ice to simulate progressive undercutting of the ice front by melting. At selected time steps, the model geometry was exported into the DPM, and runs conducted to study fracturing and calving behavior using different values of the fracture stress. We quantify the O’Leary Effect for different geometries, and propose a modified calving law incorporating the effects of melt-undercutting. The results highlight the importance of accounting for the impact of melt undercutting on calving losses in dynamic calving models.",

            "abstract": "The Indonesian maritime continent (IMC) is a miniature of our land-sea coexisting planet Earth. Firstly, without interior activity, the Earth becomes an even-surfaced “aqua-planet” with both atmosphere and ocean flowing almost zonally, and solar differential heating generates (global thermal tides and) Hadley’s meridional circulations with ITCZ along the equator as observed actually over open (Indian and Pacific) oceans in the both sides of IMC. ITCZ involves intraseasonal variations or super cloud clusters moving eastward. Secondly, the lands and seas over the actual Earth have been keeping the area ratio of 3:7 (similar to that of islands and inland/surrounding seas in IMC), but their displacements have produced IMC near the equator, which turns equatorial Pacific easterly current northward (Kuroshio) and reflects equatorial oceanic waves inducing coupled ocean-atmosphere interannual variations such as ENSO and IOD, or displacements of Walker’s zonal circulations. Thirdly, because IMC consists of many large/small islands with very long coastlines, many narrow straits become a dam for the global (Pacific to Indian) ocean circulation, and the land-sea heat capacity contrasts along the coastlines generate the world’s largest rainfall with diurnal cycles (sea-land breeze circulations). The diurnal cycles are dominant in the rainy season (austral summer in Jawa and Bali), because rainfall-induced sprinkler-like land cooling reverses the trans-coastal temperature gradient before sunrise, and subsequent clear sky on land until around noon provides solar heating dependent on season. These processes lead to rapid land/hydrosphere-atmosphere water exchange, local air pollutant washout, and transequatorial boreal winter monsoon (cold surge). In El Niño years the cooler sea-surface temperature suppresses the morning coastal-sea rainfall, and induces often serious smog over IMC. Lastly, high-resolution observations/models covering both over islands and seas are necessary. A radar-profiler network (HARIMAU) has been constructed during FY2005-09, and capacity building on radar operations and buoy manufacturing has been promoted during FY2009-13 by Japan-Indonesia collaboration projects, which are taken over by an Indonesian national center (MCCOE) established in November 2013.",

When compared with eruptive activity, eruption column and estimates of mass flow rate they can be used to constrain physical models of eruptive processes. The 1998 and 2004 Grímsvötn eruptions were captured by intermittent GPS observations but in 2011 the detailed temporal evolution of co-eruptive deformation was revealed by a kinematic 1 Hz solutions for the position of a single continuous GPS site on the volcano, supplemented with ground tilt observations. The observations can be explained by inflow of magma and pressure buildup between eruptions in a shallow chamber at about 1.7 km depth beneath the center of the Grímsvötn caldera complex, and pressure drop and magma outflow during eruptions. The rate of pressure change in the magma chamber correlates with the height of the volcanic plume over the course of the 2011 eruption. Peaks in activity relate to periods of rapid pressure drop in the chamber. GPS observations and interferometric analysis of satellite radar images from the TerraSAR-X satellite show that the explosive 2010 eruption at Eyjafjallajökull was on the other hand associated with gradual contraction of a source, distinct from pre-eruptive inflation sources at the volcano. For the initial 10-days of the summit eruption, a deflating sill source under the summit at about 5 km depth can explain the observed deformation, but then the source geometry appears to evolve. The rate of deflation was interrupted by inflow of new magma into the deflating source during the eruption in relation to peaks in explosive activity. The contrasting behavior of the two volcanoes is interpreted in terms of different magma plumbing systems of the volcanoes. In both cases, the erupted volume of magma is much larger than the inferred co-eruptive volume change, attributed to compressibility of magma residing in the sources where the eruptions originated from.",

We investigate: (1) Effect of stress heterogeneities on deformation behavior and microstructural development and, (2) effect of such microstructures on post-deformational recrystallization.\n(1) Full-field elasto-viscoplastic modelling (CraFT) is used to predict the local stress and strain field during transient creep in a polycrystalline ice sample. Modeling input includes the experimental starting microstructure and a validated slip system dependent flow law. EBSD measurements on selected areas are used to estimate the local dislocation field utilizing the Weighted Burgers Vector (WBV) analysis. Areas of local stress concentration correlate with triple junctions and grain boundaries, originating from strain incompatibilities between differently oriented grains. In these areas, the WBV analysis shows a non-negligible c-axis component that must be related to resolved shear stress in a prismatic plane, coherent with the predicted elevated stress levels. The resultant defect structure is necessary for the formation of the observed kink bands which have a well-defined crystallographic character, lattice distortions and subgrain development.\n(2) The microstructures arising from (1) significantly affect post-deformational behavior. Combined post-deformational annealing experiments and numerical simulations using the microdynamic modeling platform ELLE, allow prediction of the local microstructural evolution taking recovery within grains, grain boundary migration and nucleation into account.\nResults from this study, can explain several of the observed features in natural ice, and help to refine large scale models.",

We developed a parsimonious but physically-based model of hyporheic flow for application in large river basins: Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS). At the core of NEXSS is a characterization of the channel geometry, geomorphic features, and related hydraulic drivers based on scaling equations from the literature and readily accessible information such as river discharge, bankfull width, median grain size, sinuosity, channel slope, and regional groundwater gradients. Multi-scale hyporheic flow is computed based on combining simple but powerful analytical and numerical expressions that have been previously published. We applied NEXSS across a broad range of geomorphic diversity in river reaches and synthetic river networks. NEXSS demonstrates that vertical exchange beneath submerged bedforms dominates hyporheic fluxes and turnover rates along the river corridor. Moreover, the hyporheic zone’s potential for biogeochemical transformations is comparable across stream orders, but the abundance of lower-order channels results in a considerably higher cumulative effect for low-order streams. Thus, vertical exchange beneath submerged bedforms has more potential for biogeochemical transformations than lateral exchange beneath banks, although lateral exchange through meanders may be important in large rivers. These results have implications for predicting outcomes of river and basin management practices.",

            "abstract": "Olympus Mons volcano on Mars has been mapped in detail by remote sensing instruments from numerous Mars missions. It is characterized by faulting and mass movements, a circumferential scarp, and upper- to mid-flank terraces on the shield. These morphologies have been variously interpreted to be the result of lithospheric flexure, volcanic spreading, or combinations thereof. The evolutionary details and structural history of Olympus Mons are unknown, however. Therefore we aim to understand the role of the combined effects of lithospheric flexure and volcanic spreading in the evolution of the volcano. For this purpose we first re-investigate the structural geology as seen in high resolution satellite imagery. Second, we simulate the deformation of a volcanic cone including elastoplastic rheology and a variable coupling-decoupling behavior at the interface between volcano and lithosphere. We show that terrace-bounding faults on Olympus Mons flanks are thrust faults, and result from compression due to lithospheric flexure that is transferred into the edifice interfering with volcanic spreading. The presence and expression of these faults hence depends on the coupling of volcano and lithosphere, on the time of volcano growth relative to mantle relaxation, and on the edifice cohesion. We further show that a decoupling interface between volcano and lithosphere leads to normal faulting in the edifice center near the transition to the lithosphere, and to basal overthrusting probably correlated to Olympus Mons’ scarp. From a comparison of morphologies observed on Olympus Mons with remote sensing methods and faulting structures resulting from finite element models, we can interpret the state of stress inside the edifice which is crucial to magma ascent.",

The objective of this presentation is to provide an update on the current state of consistency between various analyses (satellite and model-derived) of Arctic snow cover extent (SCE) and snow water equivalent (SWE), and the implications of this uncertainty on modeling applications such as evaluating the simulation of snow cover in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models.\nMonthly SCE determined from the NOAA snow chart climate data record was compared to four other snow products based on meteorological forcing from reanalysis coupled with different land surface models. While all the datasets show spring snow cover extent (SCE) in the Arctic (land surface >60N) has undergone significant reductions over the past decade, the uncertainty (standard deviation) in monthly mean Arctic SCE (April, May, June) for the 5 SCE products varies between 50 and 75% of the between-model standard deviation for 14 CMIP5 models over the 1981-2010 period. The same multi-dataset approach was utilized to determine spread in pan-Arctic SWE. There is a similar degree of variability between the SWE products relative to CMIP5 simulations, but the coupled models tend to have a higher magnitude of peak pre-melt SWE than the observational analyses, which may contribute to a slower rate of spring SCE loss in the CMIP5 simulations.\nWhile the resolution of current SWE products (25 – 100 km) is sufficient for climate model evaluation, many applications (for example initialization of numerical weather prediction and hydrological models) are limited by these coarse resolutions. Analysis of airborne data from recent experimental field campaigns near Inuvik, Canada and Toolik Lake, Alaska have illustrated the potential for Ku-band radar measurements to provide high resolution (i.e. 500 m) SWE products sensitive to the range of SWE (0 to 150 mm) characteristic of high latitude snow cover.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we describe the OpenGeoSys (OGS) project, which is a scientific open-source initiative for numerical simulations of thermo-hydro-mechanical/chemical processes in fractured porous media. The basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework (using primarily the Finite Element Method (FEM)) for solving multi-field problems in porous and fractured media for applications in geoscience, hydrology and energy conversion. To this purpose OGS is based on an object-oriented (OO) FEM concept including a broad spectrum of interfaces for pre- and post-processing. OGS has been developed since the mid-eighties, has been continuously improved in concept and evolved through Fortran, C, and C++ implementations. The idea behind OGS is to provide an open platform to the scientific community featuring professional software-engineering tools such as platform-independent compiling and automated benchmarking. Comprehensive benchmarking books (Kolditz et al. 2012, 2014) and tutorials (Sachse et al. 2014) are being published. Benchmarking has proven to be a valuable tool for cooperation between different developer teams, for example, for code comparison and validation purposes (DEVOVALEX, CO2 BENCH and SSBENCH projects). The computational efficiency of OO codes is very important in scientific computing (Wang et al. 2009). We have already parallelized the OO codes by using both custom schemes and the PETSc library (Wang et al. 2014). Meanwhile the 6th version, ogs6, is under construction to further foster various parallel computing techniques and to improve code modularity for enhancing collaborative development by several researchers. The code is openly accessible via GitHub (\nhttps://github.com/ufz/ogs\n) and our development workflow extensively builds on Git features such as branching, merging automatic compiling, executing unit tests and code review to improve communication among developers and maintain code quality. OGS also provides a graphical user interface (DataExplorer)to visualize and construct complex hydrological models together with measured data (Rink et al. 2014). Thus, the OpenGeoSys project provides a powerful means for the analysis, simulation and visualization of coupled problems across different scales and scientific disciplines.",

            "abstract": "(Fe3+,Fe2+)-bearing serpentines close to the ideal endmember cronstedtite (Fe2+2,Fe3+) (Si, Fe3+) O5 (OH)4, are major components of CM2-type carbonaceous chondrites. Along with other hydrated minerals, they mostly formed during the first million years of the Solar System by aqueous alteration on the meteorite parent body. These secondary minerals could provide constraints to the processes of alteration. Here we developed a two-step protocol (room temperature gel precipitation / hydrothermal growth, in anoxic conditions) for the synthesis of Fe-serpentines with a controlled Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio in order to improve our understanding of Fe-serpentines formation. XRD analyses of the gels and electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) suggest the formation of Fe-serpentine seeds at room temperature. These germs have integrated significant amounts (up to 24%) of tetrahedral Fe3+, as indicated by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Hydrothermal growth at 60°C yields a clear improvement of crystallinity, further suggesting that Fe-serpentines form at low temperatures, lower than Mg-serpentines. We report that among the samples, whose composition covers the solid solution between greenalite (Fe2+-serpentine) and cronstedtite, crystallinity improves with the Fe/Si and the Fe3+ content, which respective roles remain to be evaluated. In chondrites’ parent body, Fe is mostly released by the aqueous alteration of metallic alloys and Fe2+-bearing anhydrous silicates (mostly olivine and pyroxene) and sulfides. We suggest that the formation of cronstedtite, which is associated with the early stages of parent body alteration, might have been kinetically favored by the oxidation of Fe. This raises the question of the processes involved, in the anoxic chondritic environment.",

            "abstract": "During the spring of 2014, a team of Spanish and Mexican scientists explored the western margin of Mexico in the frame of the TSUJAL project. The two main objectives were to characterize the nature and structure of the lithosphere and to identify potential sources triggering earthquakes and tsunamis at the contact between Rivera plate-Jalisco block with the North American Plate. With these purposes a set of marine geophysical data were acquired aboard the RRS James Cook.\nThis work is focus in the southern part of the TSUJAL survey, where we obtain seismic images from the oceanic domain up to the continental shelf. Thus, more than 800 km of MCS data, divided in 7 profiles, have been acquired with a 6km long streamer and using an air-gun sources ranging from 5800 c.i. to 3540 c.i. Furthermore, a wide-angle seismic profile of 190 km length was recorded in 16 OBS deployed perpendicular to the coast of Manzanillo. Gravity and magnetic, multibeam bathymetry and sub-bottom profiler data were recorded simultaneously with seismic data in the offshore area.\nPreliminary stacked MCS seismic sections reveal the crustal structure in the different domains of the Mexican margin. The contact between the Rivera and NA Plates is observed as a strong reflection at 6 s two way travel time (TWTT), in a parallel offshore profile (TS01), south of Manzanillo. This contact is also identified in a perpendicular profile, TS02, along a section of more than 100 km in length crossing the Rivera transform zone, and the plate boundary between Cocos and Rivera Plates. Northwards, offshore Pto. Vallarta, the MCS data reveals high amplitude reflections at around 7-8.5 s TWTT, roughly 2.5-3.5 s TWTT below the seafloor, that conspicuously define the subduction plane (TS06b). These strong reflections which we interpret as the Moho discontinuity define the starting bending of subduction of Rivera Plate.\nAnother clear pattern observed within the first second of the MCS data shows evidences of a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) along the continental margin, particularly strong offshore Pto. Vallarta. The integration of all these acquired geophysical information will allow obtaining a comprehensive image of the lithosphere that will be valuable for the seismic and tsunamigenic hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "The export of terrestrial carbon into the coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine was investigated from an extended field program that spanned three years and sampled four of the largest Maine and New Brunswick watersheds. Monthly observations of optical, biogeochemical and water quality parameters were collected at 67 stations during ice-free conditions. Optical proxies for biogeochemical properties were quantified with the emphasis on investigating three pools of organic carbon: algal carbon from chlorophyll fluorescence, particulate organic carbon from particle backscattering, and dissolved organic carbon from fluorescent dissolved organic matter. These proxies remained statistically robust throughout the sampling period and between watersheds. Seasonal and interannual patterns in the carbon pools varied predictably with latitude, land cover and discharge. Monthly observations indicated that dissolved organic carbon dominated total carbon export and further, that its concentration exhibited a strong coherence with river discharge, particularly the fall discharge peak. Watersheds with significant wetland were associated with the highest dissolved organic carbon concentrations over other land coverage types. While algal carbon from riverine primary production is not significant in terms of carbon export, it does significantly reduce the inorganic nutrient flux from rivers to coastal waters. Non-algal particulate organic carbon was the smallest component with isolated tributaries contributing non-negligible contributions to total organic carbon flux. In situ optical sensors deployed at the mouths of each river yielded hourly estimates of organic carbon concentration and export allowing elucidation of the variability in flux dynamics such as a hysteresis in the relationship between carbon concentration and river discharge that was not observed on weekly or monthly sampling regimes. Such observations are used to improve modeled estimates of annual carbon export.",

            "abstract": "Although most faults are surrounded by a halo of fractured rock known as a damage zone, it is not clear what role damage zones play during the seismic cycle on mature faults. Here, we present a superbly-located foreshock-mainshock-aftershock sequence surrounding the November 8, M5 Prague Oklahoma earthquake, which demonstrates most aftershocks are located within the damage zone surrounding the fault. The 2011 Prague, Oklahoma sequence included three M5+ earthquakes along three different faults over a three-day period. The November 8th event was third in the sequence and captured with an array of nine seismometers with ~2 km spacing, allowing for precise event location. We located more than 1000 foreshocks and aftershocks within a 14 hour time window, and relocated these aftershocks using waveform cross correlation and HypoDD. Because of the location precision, we can use these events to investigate spatial and temporal complexity of the foreshock and aftershock sequences.\nFirst, we compare the aftershock distribution to fracture distributions within damage zones surrounding faults. The aftershock sequence localizes to a reasonable damage zone thickness given the rupture length of the event, according to previously documented scaling between fault length and damage zone thickness. Furthermore, the aftershock density is constant within the fault zone, but falls off precipitously outside of the damage zone. Most aftershocks in this sequence occur within the first hour after the mainshock, and there is some indication of temporal migration of aftershocks away from the fault. Finally, foreshock activity along this fault was limited to the intersection with the fault that had hosted a M5.7 earthquake two days prior. Because this earthquake is potentially linked to fluid waste disposal, we interpret our results in terms of hydraulic pressure changes during the foreshock-mainshock-aftershock sequence.",

The Bravo Dome reservoir contains 1.3Gt±0.6Gt of magmatic CO2 trapped above a shallow brine aquifer. We compute that 22%±7% of the original CO2 has dissolved since its migration, and that the CO2 entered between 1.2Ma and 1.5Ma. The CO2 also contains trace amounts of noble gases, used by previous authors and this study to identify the migration direction and quantify mass of CO2 dissolved. We present a simple analytical model and experimental verification showing that noble gases in even trace amounts will not move uniformly with a migrating gas plume in the crust. Due to varying degrees of solubility in groundwater, the more volatile gases will tend to enrich at the front of the migrating CO2 plume. This effect can be used to improve interpretations of subsurface noble gas concentration gradients.",

            "abstract": "For several decades, Earth observations (EO) have been employed to monitor agriculture, including crop area, type, condition, and yield forecasting processes. However, the EO data required to consistently derive these informational products at multiple scales had not been well-defined. Responding to this dearth, we have articulated spatially explicit EO requirements with a focus on moderate resolution (10-70m) active and passive remote sensors, and evaluated current and near-term missions’ capabilities to meet these EO requirements. These spatially explicit requirements incorporate cropland location, growing season timing, and cloud cover information, establishing the revisit frequency required to yield reasonably clear views within 8 or 16 days. A comparison of these requirements with hypothetical constellations formed from current/planned moderate resolution optical EO missions shows that to return a scene at least 70% clear within 8 or 16 days, 46-55% or 10-32% of cropped areas, respectively, require a revisit more frequent than 8 days, with is more frequent than Landsat 7 & 8 combined can deliver. Supplementing Landsat 7 & 8 with missions from different space agencies leads to an improved capacity to meet requirements, with Resourcesat-2 providing the largest incremental improvement in requirements met. Globally, no single mission/observatory can consistently meet all 8 or 16 day requirements throughout the year. Meanwhile, the only way to meet a majority of these requirements is through coordination of multiple missions. Gaps exist in persistently cloudy regions and periods, highlighting the need for data coordination and for consideration of active microwave EO for agricultural monitoring.",

In this context, garnet mineral elastic properties are critical since they form major components of both mafic and ultramafic rocks in the upper mantle and transition zone, and are in fact the main mineral host for Al2O3 and CaO throughout these regions.\nThe elastic properties of single crystals of majoritic garnet (Mg3.24Al1.53Si3.23O12 and Mg3.01Fe0.17Al1.68Si3.15O12) have been experimentally determined as a function of density, temperature and composition under hydrostatic conditions up to ~30 GPa and ~600 K in an externally heated diamond anvil cell. High pressure and temperature structural refinements using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data in combination with measurements of acoustic velocities provided fundamental insights into the interatomic forces and compression mechanisms controlling garnet elasticity.\nEnd-member garnet thermo-elastic properties were fitted using the experimental data collected on the two samples with mixed compositions. The end member properties were then combined to determine the elasticity of complex garnet solid solutions. Acoustic velocities and densities of mafic, harzburgitic and lherzolitic bulk compositions in the Earth’s transition zone and uppermost lower mantle have been then calculated taking into account the phase relations along a typical mantle adiabat. These models are then compared with seismic reference models over the same depth interval to constrain the possible thermal and chemical conditions of these regions. The results indicate that slab units are likely to accumulate and potentially create enduring chemical and thermal anomalies at the base of the transition zone.",

Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for it; one of them is a dissipation of large-scale variations of solar wind parameters into the thermal energy via turbulent cascades. Shocks, including the planetary bow shocks, represent a component of the solar wind turbulence that carries a most significant portion of a free energy. Consequently, investigations of the shocks from the point of view of turbulence are of a great interest.\nThe BMSW instrument onboard the Spektr-R spacecraft provides a high-time resolution data (31 ms) of the ion flux, velocity, density, and temperature suitable for an analysis of the frequency spectra up to 10 Hz. Based on this high-time resolution, we analyze an evolution of the frequency spectra on MHD and kinetic scales across fast forward low-Mach number shocks as well as changes through the Earth’s bow shock representing high-Mach number reverse shocks. A role of the foreshock processes in this evolution is highlighted. We discuss the upstream and downstream plasma parameters that determine the properties of the turbulence such as spectral slopes and breaks in the frequency spectra.",

Accelerated melting can be induced by the deposition of e.g., mineral dust and black carbon that reduce the surface albedo. Data on source regions and chemical characteristics of snow impurities are however scarce in Central Asia.\nWe studied aerosol deposited between summers of 2012 and 2013on three different glaciers in the Kyrgyz Republic. Samples were taken from two snow pits on the glacier Abramov in the northern Pamir and from one snow pit on Ak-Shiirak and Suek in the central Tien Shan. The snow was analyzed for elemental and total organic carbon, major ions and mineral dust. In addition, dissolved organic carbon was speciated by using the Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol spectrometer.\nElevated mineral dust concentrations were found on all glaciers during summer and winter with lower annual average concentrations (20 mg l-1)in the northern Pamir (factor 5 to 6). Correlations between dust tracers varied, indicating different source regions. Average EC concentrations showed seasonal variation in the northern Pamir (> 100 µg l-1 in summer, < 30 µg l-1 in winter) while there was little variation throughout the year in the central Tien Shan (~ 200 µg l-1). Similarly, OC:EC ratios showed no seasonal cycle in that region averaging around 3. On Abramov, the ratio was significantly higher in winter (> 12) than in summer (< 4). The average O:C ratios across all glaciers ranged between 0.65 and 1.09, indicating a high degree of oxygenation which suggests long-range transport of the organic snow impurities. Marker substances such as potassium and mercury and their correlations suggest contribution from biomass burning emissions.\nAtmospheric measurements in August 2013 were conducted to obtain information on background aerosol characteristics in the remote high mountain areas. The average black carbon concentration was 0.26 µg/m³ (± 0.24 µg/m³).",

            "abstract": "Heat transfer through the mantle is carried by convection, which involves plastic flow of the mantle constituents. Among these constituents, (Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)O3 perovskite is known to be the most abundant. This material is deformed at very low strain rate (from 10-12 to 10-16 s-1), and under extreme pressure and temperature conditions (from 30 to 140GPa, 1500 to 4000°C). Its plastic behaviour is challenging to reproduce experimentally, but crucial for a better understanding of the Earth's dynamic.\nThe recent progress in modelling the behaviours of materials, which until now have been mostly used on metals, are applied here on MgSiO3 perovskite (Mg-Pv). We characterize dislocations at the atomic scale, as the first step of a multi-scale modelling approach on Mg-Pv plastic deformation.\nWe model dislocations with [100] and [010] Burgers vectors (described within the Pbnm space group), which are the shortest lattice parameters in the orthorhombic structure. Dislocation cores are determined to be described at various pressures. The resistance to glide of the dislocations is quantified indicating that [100](010) and [010](100) are the easiest slip systems in Mg-Pv over the full pressure range of the lower mantle.\nThe effect of temperature is introduced by assimilating the thermal activation on dislocation lines to vibrations of a string lying into a potential valley. These vibrations allow the dislocation to overcome locally the energy barrier that represents the lattice friction, and then propagates under the effect of stress. With this model, by combining elastic theory of dislocations and calculations at the atomic scale, a first expression of the strain rate produced by dislocation glide is provided.\nLeft figure : Thermally activated propagation of dislocation over the energy barrier\nRight figure : Shape of the crossing dislocation obtained from atomic scale modelling",

            "abstract": "Bray and von Storch (2009) showed that there is considerable confusion among scientists in differentiating forecasts, projections, and scenarios, and that this confusion is echoed by the IPCC.\nThese misunderstandings are not only found in making predictions, and in classifying which future-statements count as predictions, but also under which circumstances predictions must be verified. There is general recognition that good models produce good forecasts, but there is no escape from the implication that a bad forecast arises from a flawed model by claiming a forecast wasn't a forecast (or prediction) but a projection or scenario (see e.g. Risbey, 2014).\nWe show forecasts, projections, and scenarios (when used prospectively) are equivalent, and that all face the same burden of verification.\nAny model M, statistical or physical, is a complex mixture of past data, time, and external evidence which specifies the model form. Forecasts f about some observable y are conditional on M and on a guess \"x\" about what the future holds. (Confusingly, sometimes x is called a \"scenario\" and sometimes the whole forecast is called a \"scenario\".)\nThe simplest x is that the future comes in discrete time points, e.g. f(yt+1 |M, t+1...). Assuming its components are probative of y, x may be compound. E.g., suppose a climate model is built so that it is sensitive to oil price, thus x = \"Price of oil > p and t+1\".\nIf at t+1 the price of oil was not <= p, then the forecast is null: no forecast has been made, because the conditions x were not met. At this point, some might call this forecast a \"projection\" and ignore its verification. But since this x is probative of y, the model also implies the forecast f(y | Price <= p, t+1), which should be (after-the-fact) computed and then verified.\nExamples where predictions which have \"escaped\" verification, as well as strategies of verification, will be given.",

            "abstract": "We present new images of lithospheric structure obtained from P-to-S receiver functions at 86 broadband seismic stations we deployed as part of the EarthScope IDOR experiment. The high-quality data of the IDOR survey allowed us to image in detail the crustal thickness, and the structure of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Blue Mountains accreted terranes and the Paleozoic margin of North America. At the surface, the ~110 Ma suture between the arc terranes and the North American Craton is marked by the dextral transpressional system of the Western Idaho Shear Zone (WISZ), which closely follows the Sr 0.706 isopleth. Long-lived magmatism (108 – 50 Ma) of the Idaho Batholith occurred during and after the WISZ deformation. We constructed more than 7000 P-to-S teleseismic receiver functions using iterative time domain deconvolution, and we used H-k grid search, inversion, and common conversion point stacking (CCP) to image the lithospheric structure. Moho depths vary from 35-40 km beneath the Blue Mountain terranes and the extended regions of central Idaho, and shallow to ~30 km in the central part of the IDOR network. We see a clear break in the continuity of the Moho across the WISZ, with depths increasing from 30 to 40 km east of the WISZ. We also see a strong mid-crustal converting interface at 15-20 km depth beneath the Idaho Batholith on the east side of the WISZ. To the east, beneath the Lost River Range and Pahsimeroi valley, we see an offset in Moho depth possibly related to Basin-and-Range extension. A strong shallow contrast in crustal velocities beneath the West Snake River Plain is probably due to Columbia River Basalts and sedimentary cover. We observe a horizontal, continuous positive amplitude phase at ~90 km across the entire network that we interpret as the Mid-Lithospheric Discontinuity. A second positive amplitude phase varies from ~120 km beneath the accreted terranes to ~140 km beneath the western margin of the North American Craton. The increase in depth in this phase occurs over a horizontal distance of ~160 km and is most likely related to the contact between the accreted Blue Mountain lithosphere and Precambrian North America. This structure lies at depths consistent with the regional lithosphere boundary resolved by Yuan and Romanowicz (2010).",

            "abstract": "The merits of dissolved cadmium as a paleo-proxy for phosphorus has long been discussed. Dissolved ratios of Cd:P (nmol/µmol) have been shown in previous studies to be relatively constant in deep-water samples. Younger Atlantic waters typically have dissolved Cd:P of about 0.2 while older Pacific waters have a higher value of 0.36. The mid-water dissolved Cd:P differences between the Atlantic and Pacific represent an integrated signature of remineralized particulates over a span of hundreds to 1,000 years. The trends of upper ocean dissolved Cd:P suggest regional differences exist due to differences in phytoplankton uptake and particle export. Particles turn over quickly (week time scales in near surface waters – year time scales at 1000 m) and therefore direct analysis can be used to understand what causes variability in the Cd:P ratios in different phytoplankton communities under a variety of conditions. To address the drivers of inter-ocean variation, concentrations of elements, in particular Cd, Co, Zn and P were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrometry in size-fractionated particulates collected using the Multiple Unit Large Volume in-situ Filtration System (MULVFS) from the upper 1000 m at the 34 different locations throughout the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Oceans since 1991. The MULVFS technique simultaneously collects samples in three size fractions from thousands of liters of water: <1 μm, 1-51 μm and >51 μm. The collection sites have wide spatial and temporal distribution, allowing us to study the effects of an El Nino, upwelling, large scale in-situ Fe fertilization, anoxic conditions, a phytoplankton bloom and subsequent decline, and seasonal variation of Cd:P in particulates. Overall, Cd:P tends to be higher (typically 1-2 pmol/nmol) in particulates gathered in biologically dynamic waters, especially in High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) areas such as the subarctic north Pacific, equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean, and in Upwelling areas, and is much lower (typically <0.1 pmol/nmol) in oligotrophic regions. Here we present a global analysis exploring how differences in regional Cd:P particulates lead to the relatively constant dissolved deep water ratios. These results are the first global collection of particulate euphotic zone Cd:P ratios.",

            "abstract": "The Sunda subduction zone features significant along-strike structural variability including changes in accretionary prism and forearc morphology. Some of these changes have been linked to changes in megathrust faulting styles, and some have been linked to other thrust and strike-slip fault systems across this obliquely convergent margin (~54-58 mm/yr convergence rate, 40-45 mm/yr subduction rate). We examine these structural changes in detail across central Sumatra, from Siberut to Nias Island, offshore Indonesia. In this area the Investigator Fracture Zone and the Wharton Fossil Ridge, features with significant topography, are being subducted, which may affect sediment thickness variation and margin morphology. We present new seismic refraction P-wave velocity models using marine seismic data collected during Sonne cruise SO198 in 2008. The experiment geometry consisted of 57 ocean bottom seismometers, 23 land seismometers, and over 10,000 air gun shots recorded along ~1750 km of profiles. About 130,000 P-wave first arrival refractions were picked, and the picks were inverted using FAST (First Arrivals Refraction Tomography) 3-D to give a velocity model, best-resolved in the top 25 km. Moho depths, crustal composition, prism geometry, slab dip, and upper and lower plate structures provide insight into the past and present tectonic processes at this plate boundary. We specifically examine the relationships between velocity structure and faulting locations/ styles. These observations have implications for strain-partitioning along the boundary. The Mentawai Fault, located west of the forearc basin in parts of Central Sumatra, has been interpreted variably as a backthrust, strike-slip, and normal fault. We integrate existing data to evaluate these hypotheses. Regional megathrust earthquake ruptures indicate plate boundary segmentation in our study area. The offshore forearc west of Siberut is almost aseismic, reflecting the locked state of the plate interface, which last ruptured in 1797. The weakly-coupled Batu segment experiences sporadic clusters of events near the forearc slope break. The Nias segment in the north ruptured in the 2005 M8.7 earthquake. We compare P-wave velocity structure to the earthquake data to examine potential links between lithospheric structure and seismogenesis.",

            "abstract": "We present earthquake site response results from a 48-channel multicomponent seismic land streamer and large weight drop system. We acquired data along a grid of city streets in western Idaho at a rate of a few km per day where we derived shear wave velocity profiles to a depth of 40-50 m by incorporating vertical and radial geophone signals to capture the complete elliptical Rayleigh wave motion. We also obtained robust p-wave reflection and refraction results by capturing the returned signals that arrive at non-vertical incidence angles that result from the high-velocity road surface layer. By integrating the derived shear wave velocity profiles with p-wave reflection results, we include depositional and tectonic boundaries from the upper few hundred meters into our analysis to help assess whether ground motions may be amplified by shallow bedrock. By including p-wave refraction information into the analysis, we can identify zones of high liquefaction potential by comparing shear wave and p-wave velocity (Vp/Vs) measurements relative to refraction-derived water table depths. The utilization of multicomponent land streamer data improves signal-noise levels over single component data with no additional field effort. The added multicomponent data processing step can be as simple as calculating the magnitude of the vector for surface wave and refraction arrivals or rotating the reflected signals to the maximum emergence angle based on near surface p-wave velocity information. We show example data from a number of Idaho communities where historical earthquakes have been recorded. We also present numerical models and systematic field tests that show the effects of a high velocity road surface layer in surface and body wave measurements. We conclude that multicomponent seismic information derived from seismic land streamers can provide a significant improvement in earthquake hazard assessment over a standard single component approach with only a small addition in processing time.",

            "abstract": "Polarity transitions and magnetic excursions have durations of a few thousand years, or less. Transition/excursion records in volcanic sequences are, at best, partial snap-shots of the transition/excursion field. Records from high-sedimentation-rate marine sediments may be more continuous but they are always smoothed by progressive acquisition of detrital remanent magnetization (DRM), and by sampling/measurement limitations. North Atlantic records of the Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) polarity transition are compared with records of the Iceland Basin excursion (190 ka). Virtual geomagnetic polar (VGP) paths are used to map characteristic magnetization directions during the transition/excursion. Relative paleointensity (RPI) proxies indicate partial recovery of field intensity during the transition/excursion, with RPI minima coinciding with abrupt VGP shifts at the onset and end of the transition/excursion. Discrepancies in VGP paths among holes at the same site, among sites, and a comparison of u-channel and discrete sample measurements, reveal limitations in resolution of the transition/excursion fields. During the M-B polarity transition, VGP clusters appear in the NW Pacific, NE Asia and in the South Atlantic. Similarities in VGP clustering for the M-B boundary and the Iceland Basin excursion imply that the polarity transition and excursion fields had common characteristics. Similarities with the modern non-axial dipole (NAD) field imply that polarity transitions and excursions involve the demise of the Earth’s axial dipole relative to the NAD field, and that the NAD field has long-lasting features locked in place by the lowermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations indicate a warming of permafrost in many northern regions with a resulting degradation of ice-rich and carbon-rich permafrost. In the last 30-40 years, warming in permafrost temperatures observed in Northern Eurasia, Canada, and Alaska has resulted in the thawing of permafrost in natural, undisturbed conditions in areas close to the southern boundary of the permafrost zone. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the vulnerability of permafrost under climate warming across the Permafrost Region of the Northern Hemisphere. We applied the process-based permafrost dynamics model GIPL2 (Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab), using a historical climate forcing CRU3.1 data set for retrospective (1960-2009) and CCSM4 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (2009-2300) for analysis of permafrost dynamics in the future. We estimated dynamics of the area and volume of seasonally thawed soils within the three upper meters across the entire Permafrost Domain. During the last four decades of the 20th century, the simulated total area and the volume of thawed soils with Active Layer Thickness (ALT) shallower than 3 m has been varying between 11 and 13 million km2, and between 17.3 to 19.4 thousand km3 respectively. Our projections according to the CCSM4 RCP4.5 climate scenario indicate that the maximum unfrozen volume of soil within three upper meters would change between 12.8 and 20.8 thousand km3 during 2009-2300. Despite the slower rate of soil warming in peatland areas and a slower degradation of permafrost under peat soils, a considerable volume of peat (approximately 20% of the total volume of peat in the Northern Hemisphere) could be thawed by the end of the current century and 35% by 2300. The potential release of carbon and the net effect of this thawing will depend on the balance between increased productivity and respiration, and will also depend on soil moisture dynamics.",

            "abstract": "In a given tectonic province and over thousands to millions of years, slip on faults is believed to be constant and approximately equal to the local tectonic rate in agreement with rigid plate tectonic theory. In this model the ductile lower crust flows in response to this steady plate motion. Moreover brittle and ductile behaviors interact only at a sharp boundary defined as the brittle ductile transition (BDT). However in the continental lithosphere brittle and ductile behavior may coexist over a large range of pressure and temperature conditions for different mineral compositions. This generates heterogeneities in the brittle and ductile crust that are often ignored in models of shear zones. We hypothesize that the interaction between brittle (elastic) and ductile (viscous) behavior may cause deviations from steady-state slip and generates transient creep events on shear zones that release many meters of creep over years to thousands of years marked by a single period of tectonic activity followed by quiescence.\nWe present a set of numerical and analytical models, analogue experiments as well as some observations in nature that may support this hypothesis. In this presentation we extend an analytic formulation to model creep events within shear zones at the transition between brittle and ductile behavior in the crust. We assume that creep events are triggered by a set of interconnected fractures modeled as propagating dislocations. The amount of connectivity controls the nature and the intensity of the transient creep events. The shear zone behaves as a forced damped oscillator that can release strain accumulated during jammed/locked periods. The creep can be over-, critically-, or under-damped. The time scale of the events may vary between seconds to thousands of years depending on the viscous, elastic and plastic (fractures) properties of the shear zone.",

            "abstract": "Flash floods commonly cause rapid gully erosion, creating headwalls that erode into previously stable surfaces, thereby reducing arable land and releasing sediment that can contaminate water supplies. In semi-arid landscapes, gully erosion tends to be driven by flash floods. Here, we study the mechanisms for flash-flood generation, seeking to answer two questions: (1) how spatially variable is runoff production, and (2) what combination of rainfall intensity and duration is required to produce runoff? To answer these questions, we combine field data from a study site on the Colorado High Plains, USA, with numerical modeling. The site is characterized by patchy, dryland shrub vegetation dispersed throughout the otherwise bare slopes and gullies. Analysis of six years of rainfall and runoff data indicate that flash flood generation requires a 15-minute intensity of approximately 38 mm/hr. Sprinkler experiments on isolated bare and vegetated plots revealed a large contrast between infiltration capacities: bare areas can produce runoff when the rainfall exceeds 10-15 mm/hr, whereas vegetated areas permit infiltration of at least 45 mm/hr during relatively brief, intense events. These findings imply that high-intensity rainstorms associated with summertime moist convective systems drive gully incision. They also suggest that a self-enhancing feedback may exist in which initial incision creates steep and relatively bare slopes that tend to generate more runoff, leading to more aggressive gully incision.",

            "abstract": "Interglacials are the warm, minimum ice, high sea level end-member of the glacial climate cycles of the Pleistocene, with the present Holocene period as the most recent example. We have identified 11 interglacial intervals in the last 800 ka and have reviewed their occurrence, intensity, shape and timing, including the processes that accompany deglaciation and glacial inception. Our compilation of evidence from marine, terrestrial and ice core climate archives suggests that, despite spatial inhomogeneity, marine isotope stages (MIS) 5 and 11 were globally strong (warm), while MIS 13 tended to be cool. A step change in strength of interglacials at ~450 ka (mid-Brunhes) is apparent only in CO2, and Antarctic and deep ocean temperature. The onset of interglacials (deglaciation or glacial “termination”) is relatively rapid, and seems to require a combination of low orbital precession (high northern hemisphere summer insolation) and the existence of a large ice sheet. Terminations involve highly non-linear interactions of ocean and atmospheric dynamics, sea level, CO2 and temperature, along with the imposed external insolation forcing. The precise timing appears to be closely tied to the fall in precession but may be modulated by millennial scale climate variability that determines the pattern of change seen in temperature in each hemisphere. There is some organized variability and a range of climatic trends within interglacials, resulting in intensity maxima that may occur either early or late in different instances. The end of interglacials (glacial inception) is typically a slower process involving a global sequence of changes. Interglacials are typically 10-30 ka long. Proposed analogs do not easily inform us about the natural progression or length of the current interglacial, but due to a combination of reduced insolation variability and greenhouse gas concentrations the timing of the next glacial inception appears to be many tens of millennia in the future.",

            "abstract": "The mantle transition zone (TZ) is believed to be primarily composed of three constituents: wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and majorite garnet (Ringwood, 1975). Laboratory sound velocity measurements for wadsleyite and ringwoodite alone are too high to match TZ seismological models (Li et al., Science, 1998; Sinogeikin et al., JGR, 1998), while majorite yields significantly lower sound velocities (Sinogeikin et al., GRL, 2002; Gwanmesia et al., PEPI, 2009). Taken together, a compositional model such as pyrolite yields a good fit to seismology within uncertainties, with the major discrepancies being that pyrolite yields slightly larger velocity jumps and shallower velocity gradients than seismology (Li and Liebermann, Science, 2007; Irifune et al., Nature, 2008). Hydration of ringwoodite in the transition zone is expected to reduce seismic velocities. If the lower part of the TZ is hydrated, as some recent studies suggest (Pearson et al., Nature, 2014; Schmandt et al., Science, 2014), the proportions of ringwoodite and majoritic garnet in the TZ should be re-evaluated.\nVelocity gradients in the TZ are likely related to the gradual eclogite-garnetite transition. Over the TZ pressure range (~13-24 GPa), the dissolution of pyroxene into garnet gradually increases, resulting in a complex depth-varying garnet-majorite solid solution, ranging from M4Si4O12 majorite (Mj) to M3Al2Si3O12 garnet (Gt), where M is Mg, Fe, Ca0.5Mg0.5, etc. (Akaogi and Akimoto, PEPI, 1977; Bina and Wood, GRL, 1984; Gasparik, CMP, 1989). Several studies have considered the compositional dependence of majoritic garnet elastic moduli (Liu et al., PEPI, 2000; Sinogeikin et al., EPSL, 2002; Sinogeikin and Bass, GRL, 2002; Murakami et al., EPSL, 2008), but few have considered both composition and hydration state under the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions of the TZ. Here we combine in situ X-ray and Brillouin measurements to determine the elastic constants of various majoritic garnet compositions under pressure and temperature conditions of the TZ, up to 25 GPa and 1000°C. The elastic moduli dependence on composition and hydration of majorite garnet are of first-order importance when seeking to constrain mineralogical models of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Rivers export and transform globally-significant quantities of carbon from watersheds to coastal ecosystems. Urbanization and climate change influence these fluxes by altering the hydrologic regime, water temperature, and anthropogenic sources of organic matter. Here, we quantify export and metabolism of carbon in highly urbanized, coastal watersheds, and evaluate the importance of physical drivers linked to climate and land use. Using a combination of discrete-samples, continuous water quality sensors, lab experiments, and modeling, we quantified rates of DOC, DIC, and CO2 export as well as changes in DOC quality and in-stream metabolism in four highly developed watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay over three years. Annual DOC and DIC exports from the four watersheds varied from 9 to 23 and 19 to 59 Kg ha-1yr-1 respectively. The range of daily CO2 concentrations was 0.01 to 2.6mg L-1, equivalent to between 0.37 and 53% of daily DOC export across all streams and dates. All sites were net-heterotrophic for the majority of the year (NEP<0), with strong peaks in gross primary production and net autotrophy (NEP >0) during spring and early summer. There was a significant (P<0.05) relationship between gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, suggesting that autotrophic respiration is an important fraction of ER, and labile algal biomass may influence oxygen demand downstream. Our results suggest that urban watersheds can export significant amounts of DOC, DIC, and CO2 to coastal zones. The influence of urbanization on coastal water quality and greenhouse gases may be exacerbated by climate change as temperatures and storm frequency continue to rise.",

            "abstract": "The design of effective management policies for socioenvironmental systems requires the development of comprehensive, yet sufficiently simple, decision support systems (DSS) for policy makers. Guatemala is a particularly complex case, combining an enormous diversity of climates, geographies, and agroecosystems within a very small geographical scale. Although food insecurity levels are very high, indicating a generally inadequate management of the varied agroecosystems of the country, different regions have shown vastly different trends in food insecurity over the past decade, including between regions with similar geophysical and climatic characteristics and/or governmental programmes (e.g., agricultural support). These observations suggest two important points: firstly, that not merely environmental conditions but rather socio-environmental interactions play a crucial role in the successful management of human-environmental systems, and, secondly, that differences in the geophysical and climatic environments between the diverse regions significantly impact the success or failure of policies.\nThis research uses participatory systems dynamic modelling (SDM) to build a DSS that allows local decision-makers to (1) determine the impact of current and potential policies on agroecosystem management and food security, and (2) design sustainable and resilient policies for the future. The use of participatory SDM offers several benefits, including the active involvement of the end recipients in the development of the model, greatly increasing its acceptability; the integration of physical (e.g., precipitation, crop yield) and social components in one model; adequacy for modelling long-term trends in response to particular policy decisions; and the inclusion of local stakeholder knowledge on system structure and trends through the participatory process. Preliminary results suggest that there is a set of common variables explaining the generally high levels of food insecurity in Guatemala (e.g., agricultural productivity), while others (e.g., land dynamics and access to water resources) are restricted to certain regions and have a relatively important weight in determining the success or failure of policies in these regions.",

            "abstract": "The Los Alamos National Laboratory is conducting a research project to understand the physical mechanisms behind the Las Conchas Fire that occurred in Santa Fe National Forest near Los Alamos, New Mexico on June 26, 2011. Between 8 pm on June 26 and 3 am on June 27, the fire grew from 8,000 to 43,000 acres, spreading downhill in sparse fuels and lighter winds than were present during the first several hours of the fire. Fire behavior experts and fire management officers expected the fire to reach 9,000 to 12,000 acres by sunrise due to the anticipated burning conditions, but it actually increased 440% in size before 3 am, surprising everyone. One viable hypothesis was suggested for this baffling fire behavior: a partial collapse of the soot-laden pyrocumulus column (pyro-cu) that towered above the fire, causing a sustained density current carrying fire at high speed. Moreover, another mechanism has been suggested recently that could have significantly affected the fire characteristics around mountainous regions, such as Jemez Mountains near Los Alamos: the drastic changes in the speed, direction, and gustiness of the winds due to the development of mountain waves. The present research tests these hypotheses and attempts to decipher the combination of environmental conditions, due to pyro-cu and mountain wave interactions, and fire behavior dynamics associated with this anomalous wildfire event. Preliminary results from WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) and HIGRAD (High-GRADient model developed at LANL) simulations suggest that these two mechanisms may need to be taken into account in order to fully understand and prepare for atypical wildfire behavior in regions with complex topography. It is possible that the Las Conchas Fire could have directly affected the nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory if the fire broke out concurrently with both pyro-cu and strong mountain waves along the upstream of the Laboratory. This research also addresses its implications for the management as well as the research of wildfire in that, in order to prepare for potential wildfire, the topography of the surrounding region as well as the region of importance itself should be taken into account.",

A substantial amount of flare energy goes into accelerating electrons. HXR observations are a crucial tool for understanding this non-thermal emission and the energy release in flares. RHESSI is able to study this emission over many orders of magnitude (active region flares from X-class to A-class microflares), but it cannot detect the emission from smaller events. Such “nanoflares” have been postulated as a possible source of coronal heating and their existence and relationship to larger flares is still uncertain. In order to detect these events in HXRs, instruments more sensitive than RHESSI are required. Launched in 2012, the astrophysics mission NuSTAR uses focusing optics to directly image X-rays between ~2-80 keV. Although not optimized for solar observations, NuSTAR’s highly sensitive imaging spectroscopy will be used to search for the faintest X-ray emission from the Sun. These solar observations will begin in September 2014. Here we present the first results of our search for transient brightenings in active and quiet Sun regions with NuSTAR.",

            "abstract": "In low energy environments such as the subsurface, the minimum energy required to maintain cellular integrity and function (maintenance energy) may represent a significant fraction of the total energy available to microbial communities. However, traditional kinetic and thermodynamic models incorporating key microbial processes are often developed using data collected in nutrient rich growth media. In this study, slow microbial growth in the subsurface was simulated using a flow through bioreactor system in experiments designed to determine the maintenance energy requirement of the model subsurface bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. An existing bioreactor system (Applikon EZ-control®, 2.4 L) was modified to include a biomass retention filtration unit (retentostat) resulting in biomass accumulation over time. An artificial low-nutrient groundwater medium was optimized for slow S. oneidensis growth and was supplied and removed from the reactor at flow rates on the order of 1 mL min-1 with a dilution rate of 0.025 h-1. The retentostat was run under electron donor limited conditions with nitrate, a common groundwater contaminant, supplied at 0.025 mM h-1 and lactate supplied in excess at 0.125 mM h-1. Respiratory ammonification of nitrate by S. oneidensis and cell growth was monitored over time (40 days) and compared to parallel incubations in batch reactors. Initial rates of ammonification were similar in the bioreactor and batch reactors, however, optical density and ATP measurements showed slow yet increasing microbial growth over time (generation time = 17 days) in the retentostat. In contrast, cells in the batch reactors did not grow significantly and died within 2 weeks of inoculation. A maintenance energy demand was estimated (2.5 kJ C-mol biomass h-1) by fitting the biomass production rates to the van Verseveld equation. The low maintenance energy demand of S. oneidensis as compared to typical maintenance energies reported in the literature (>10 kJ C-mol biomass h-1) likely reflects its metabolic versatility and ability to persist in low energy environments. In addition to the retentostat results, we will also discuss our efforts to develop a kinetic and thermodynamic based biogeochemical model which explicitly accounts for energy used for both microbial maintenance and growth.",

            "abstract": "N-dimensional chemical space on Earth and beyond produces diverse habitats for microbial activity. Hydrothermal environments cover a wide range of habitable space up to and including life’s known limits and provide a window into deep geological, geochemical, and biological processes. Hydrothermal water compositions, as sampled from and measured in terrestrial hot springs on Earth's surface, vary in chemical constituent speciation and concentrations over orders of magnitude in a plethora of geochemical parameters with biological significance, including hydronium ion, sulfide, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and molybdenum. Proteins provide a link between geochemistry and microbial activity by catalyzing chemical reactions. Proteins extracted and identified by tandem mass spectrometry from 13 hot spring sediments and biofilms - covering pH values from 2-9 and diverse geochemical compositions - function as efflux transporters, permeases, electron transporters, and others, suggesting that these processes were present in the environment and occurring at the time of sampling. Metalloenzymes have been identified, including the iron protein rubrerythrin, thought to be involved in oxidative stress protection in anaerobic bacteria and archaea, as well as proteins involved in macronutrient processing (carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur). The melding of biochemistry with geochemistry shows potential for quantifying microbial activity in deep environments by demonstrating the presence - and as techniques improve, relative abundances - of reaction-catalyzing enzymes. Moreover, using hot spring sources and their outflow channels as chemical and biological models of geologic time helps decipher the origin and co-evolution of life and geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Metal isotopes are novel tools, and have expanded the geochemical toolbox for elucidating the functioning of the Earth over various time scales. Carbonate-based stable isotope proxies now extend well beyond the traditional major elements (C and O) to include Ca, as well as trace elements such as Sr, S, Mg, B, Li, Cd, and U. Such trace isotopic proxies may contain invaluable information about the Earth system in the past, but can be susceptible to diagenetic alteration over long time scales. It is therefore critical that diagenetic effects are understood and can be recognized in ancient rocks. The extent of alteration depends on reaction rate and advection velocity in the sedimentary section, and elemental partitioning and isotopic effects associated with diagenesis. Numerical approaches, such as reactive transport models, are extremely useful tools for constraining such variables, and for testing hypotheses related to alteration of proxy records.\nReactive transport models allow for constraints on calcite recrystallization rates in natural systems; data from ODP Sites 807A, 1170A, 1171A, and 806B suggest rapid recrystallization in relatively young sediments, as well as a Ca isotopic fractionation factor (α) associated with calcite recrystallization close to 1 (Δ=0). While the former is critical for addressing the fidelity and accuracy of a variety of geochemical proxies, the latter is distinctly different from that associated with the formation of carbonates in the surface ocean (Δ~ -1.35‰), suggesting considerable isotopic leverage to alter Ca isotopes during diagenesis. While Ca isotopes are generally well buffered in carbonate-rich sediments, this leverage to alter may be expressed as a reduction in the amplitude of geochemical variability in the solid or as a result of reactions near the sediment-seawater interface (as seen at ODP Site 1221 associated with chemical burndown during the PETM). Further, the Ca and Mg isotopic compositions of shallow water carbonates at ODP Site 1196A suggest recognizeable diagenetic trends that can be explained using simple numerical models, and offer constraints on the Mg partition coefficient and isotopic fractionation factors associated with dolomitization and recrystallization.",

            "abstract": "Coastal upwelling zones are among the most productive regions in the world and play a major role in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Recent research suggests that a substantial fraction of newly fixed organic matter is exported offshore in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, to date only a few studies have examined DOM composition in the context of production and export from upwelling systems. The ultimate fate and geochemical impact of coastal DOM exported to offshore and mesopelagic ecosystems also remains largely unknown.\nBetween 2007-2009 we conducted a high-resolution biogeochemical time series at the Granite Canyon Marine Pollution Studies Lab in part to evaluate the seasonal production and export of DOM from the Central CA coast. Our previous work demonstrated substantial, albeit disparate, seasonal production of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) – with high DON (and low C:N ratios) produced during upwelling and high DOC produced during summer/fall water column stratification (Walker and McCarthy, 2012). Here we present new total dissolved D/L amino acid (TDAA) and UV-oxidizable DOC radiocarbon (Δ14C) data with the goal of determining the relative sources (heterotrophic vs. autotrophic), bioavailability, microbial processing and 14C-ages of C-rich vs. N-rich DOM exported from this upwelling system.\nOur results suggest that C-rich DOM produced during water column stratification carries a large microbial signature (i.e. high D/L AA ratios and non-protein AA abundance), whereas N-rich DOM produced during upwelling appears to be fresh, autotrophic DOM (i.e. lowest D/L AA ratios and highest TDAA abundance). DOM Δ14C signatures also did not approximate in situ dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and instead were far more negative and highly correlated to water mass density. Together our results indicate a previously unrecognized source of highly labile yet pre-aged DOM potentially impacting offshore and mesopelagic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic tephra layers have been seen in most ice cores in Antarctica. These tephra layers are deposited almost instantaneously across wide areas of ice sheets, creating horizons that can provide “pinning points” to adjust ice time scales that may otherwise be lacking detailed chronology. A combination of traditional particle morphology characterization by SEM with new non-destructive X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) has been used to analyze selected coarse grained tephra in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide WDC06A ice core. Micro-CT has the ability to image particles as small as 50µm in length (15µm resolution), quantifying both particle shape and size.\n The WDC06A contains hundreds of dusty layers of which 36 have so far been identified as primary tephra layers. Two of these tephra layers have been characterized as phreatomagmatic eruptions based on SEM imagery and are blocky and platy in nature, with rare magmatic particles. These layers are strikingly different in composition from the typical phonolitic and trachytic tephra produced from West Antarctic volcanoes. These two layers are coarser in grain size, with many particles (including feldspar crystals) exceeding 100µm in length. One tephra layer found at 3149.138m deep in the ice core is a coarse ~1mm thick basanitic tephra layer with a WDC06-7 ice core age of 45,381±2000yrs. The second layer is a ~1.3 cm thick zoned trachyandesite to trachydacite tephra found at 2569.205m deep with an ice core age 22,470±835yrs. Micro-CT analysis shows that WDC06A-3149.138 has normal grading with the largest particles at the bottom of the sample (~160μm). WDC06A-2569.205 has a bimodal distribution of particles with large particles at the top and bottom of the layer. These large particles are more spherical in shape at the base and become more irregular and finer grained higher in the layer, likely showing changes in eruption dynamics. The distinct chemistry as well as the blocky and large grain size of the two tephra lead us to believe that these eruptions are from volcanoes proximal to WAIS Divide and did not transport far because neither tephra was observed in the Byrd core (<100km away). It is likely that these tephra are sourced from volcanoes beneath the WAIS and have since been buried and if they were to erupt again, may contribute to ice sheet instability.",

            "abstract": "Our current understanding of oxidative processes in the atmosphere is guided by measurements of directly-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their oxidation products. Mechanisms for this oxidation have been proposed based on these measurements. These mechanisms usually fall into two regimes: high-NOx and low-NOx (NOx = NO + NO2). High-NOx mechanisms are typical of urban environments while low-NOx mechanisms tend to dominate rural or remote areas. Understanding the low-NOx pathway presents a unique challenge. The first-generation products of this pathway are organic hydroperoxides. This class of atmospherically-relevant compounds are not commercially available and the synthetic methods used to prepare them are still underdeveloped. This work focuses on the synthesis and measurement of several isomers of isoprene hydroxyhydroperoxides (ISOPOOH), the main first-generation products of the low-NOx isoprene oxidation pathway. We present work that demonstrates that ISOPOOH is an interference in both GC and PTR-MS measurements, appearing as product of the high-NOx oxidation pathway. We suggest a possible mechanism for this interference and also discuss the implications of this interference on studies of OH reactivity, O:C ratios, OH recycling and SOA potential for these compounds. We also present results of the experiments investigating air-water partitioning and the condensed phase chemistry of these compounds.",

            "abstract": "The Ross Ice Shelf, located in the embayment between East and West Antarctica, is one of the largest underexplored patches of ocean on the planet. Sediment cores show that the Ross Ice Shelf can disintegrate during some interglacial periods. The conditions required for sudden collapse are not well constrained. A key to understanding the dynamics and long-term stability of the Ross Ice Shelf system is having high-resolution constraints on its boundary conditions, including sea floor bathymetry. The sea floor under the Ross Ice Shelf has developed in response to both the tectonic development of the West Antarctic Rift and the glacial signature of the waxing and waning Antarctic Ice Sheets. A mixture of fabrics and orientations in its bathymetry reflect this complex development.\nHowever, present oceanographic models of water circulation under the ice are based on low-resolution bathymetric maps drawn from stations spaced 55 km apart obtained during the RIGGS project in the 1970s. In contrast, most of the bathymetry of the world’s oceans has been mapped to approximately 15 km resolution from satellite altimetry and much higher resolution from acoustic surveys. Improvement of Ross Ice Shelf bathymetry can be achieved from combined analysis and inversion of gravity and magnetic data acquired from airborne surveys over the Ross Ice Shelf. Survey lines flown in 2013 by Operation IceBridge, with the Sander Geophysics Ltd AIRGrav system over the central and northern Ross Embayment provide a tenfold increase, to 5 km, of the along track resolution of bathymetry. Newly resolved bathymetric highs and lows have amplitudes of up to 200 km. Combining the gravity and magnetic surveys also reveals the differing geology across the embayment. Results from these surveys, including comparison with ship-based bathymetry data from the Ross Sea, demonstrate the value of gravity and magnetic surveys for mapping the bathymetry of the Ross Ice Shelf and the need for more comprehensive airborne surveys of the region.",

Toward this goal, SBDC worked closely with a geobiologist conducting fieldwork at YNP to explore existing data practices and held a two-day stakeholders workshop at the park with some of the scientists who study it and the National Park Service (NPS) staff who support research activities there.\nThe resulting workshop report[2] recommends, among other things, improvements to the level of detail and consistency of documentation of data and of its sampling and analysis methods. A set of core metadata elements and domain-specific extension elements is proposed (Appendix 9) to provide a more coherent view into the data.\nArmed with these findings, we are pursuing approaches that will reduce the effort, complexity, and risk tied to adoption of these recommendations. During our investigation, we discovered the EarthChem templates[3], into which we began mapping the geobiologist’s data. We find the Vent Fluids template particularly appropriate and adaptable, as many of the high-interest features at YNP are shallow water vents. We are currently building an EarthChem-compatible template that will capture the environmental context of microbes, tracing their identities from water sample through to GenBank entry.\nGiven the variety of potential targets (e.g., site, institutional, and domain repositories; visualization and presentation tools), we decided to record the data in a structured package, which we can transform for a given target. We are using the Data Conservancy’s Packaging Tool[4], which provides an intuitive file system view, stores file checksums, and serializes a graph of relationships. This permits a researcher to conveniently group desired data products into a single self-documenting TAR or Zip file.

Previous work has been done to evaluate the significance of the effects of hydrological parameters, and their identifiability from heat flux and/or streamflow observations at different flux tower sites with various climate and soil conditions. Such exploratory parameter screening and sensitivity analysis provide guidance on model calibration design; meanwhile, the exploratory ensemble simulations, associated with effective sampling of the input parameter space, can be used to developed reliable surrogate models linking input parameters and output responses such as latent heat fluxes (LH).   In this study, we test the applicability of a surrogate-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion method, at different flux tower sites, to identify favorable climate and soil conditions for such inversion efforts. The unknown parameters are decided given our previous parameter screening work, samples are then generated using the quasi-Monte Carlo approach based on the prior distributions of the unknown parameters determined given minimum-relative-entropy theory. The sample sets are ingested into CLM to generate simulations that can be used for fitting polynomial surrogates up to the third order. The surrogates are finalized by compromising the training and testing errors, and integrated in the MCMC-Bayesian framework at each flux tower site. The applicability of the calibration approach for different site conditions is discussed.",

Its basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework for solving multi-field problems for applications in geoscience and hydrology as e.g. for CO2 storage applications, geothermal power plant forecast simulation, salt water intrusion, water resources management, etc.\nAdvances in computational mathematics have revolutionized the variety and nature of the problems that can be addressed by environmental scientists and engineers nowadays and an intensive code development in the last years enables in the meantime the solutions of much larger numerical problems and applications. However, solving environmental processes along the water cycle at large scales, like for complete catchment or reservoirs, stays computationally still a challenging task.\nTherefore, we started a new OGS code development with focus on execution speed and parallelization. In the new version, a local data structure concept improves the instruction and data cache performance by a tight bundling of data with an element-wise numerical integration loop. Dedicated analysis methods enable the investigation of memory-access patterns in the local and global assembler routines, which leads to further data structure optimization for an additional performance gain.\nThe concept is presented together with a technical code analysis of the recent development and a large case study including transient flow simulation in the unsaturated / saturated zone of the Thuringian Syncline, Germany. The analysis is performed on a high-resolution mesh (up to 50M elements) with embedded fault structures.",

            "abstract": "Beginning in Fall of 2004, NASA and the National Park Service (NPS) embarked on collaborative work aimed at bringing the wonders of NASA science and education content into the hands of outstanding and highly regarded science “communicators” – interpreters in NPS. What began as a showcase of NASA content delivered in an interpretive workshop has evolved and matured into a long-standing, and growing partnership focused on climate change communication. The partnership has been fruitful and successful, producing a variety of professional development events that have resulted in participants reaching millions of Park and Refuge visitors and thousands of interpreters and educators, with content derived from our courses. Earth to Sky (ETS) now includes the US Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA, and is working towards establishment of a network of regional networks made up of alumni and their communities.\nThe key to our success has been the careful building and nurturing of the partnership, and its resulting community of practice, beginning with excellent facilitated meetings of the parties involved, and continuing through implementation of best practices in partnership and collaborative work. Project design, development, and execution were accomplished in true partnership with leaders from our intended audience, NPS interpreters, and later USFWS environmental educators. Our partners were fully involved, from the inception of the first workshop design, through its implementation and assessment, to strategic planning for sustainability and all subsequent efforts. ETS can serve as a model of an effective partnership in climate communication efforts, drawing upon the strengths of partners with widely different areas of expertise to produce cohesive work with high impact. We will share the ETS model of partnership, and discuss how this model might be useful as the climate communication community moves towards a more coherent approach to improve climate literacy.",

            "abstract": "A significant uncertainty in future land-surface carbon budgets is the response of wetlands to climate change. A corollary and related question is the future net climate (radiative) forcing impact from wetlands. Active wetlands emit both CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. CH4 is, over a few decades, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. CO2 has a longer atmospheric lifetime and a longer 'tail' to its radiative influence. Whether wetlands are a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon under future climate change will depend on ecosystem response to rising temperatures and elevated CO2. The largest uncertainty in future wetland C-budgets, and their climate forcing is the stability of the large below-ground carbon stocks, often in the form of peat, and the partitioning of CO2 and CH4 released via ecosystem respiration.\nIn advance of a long-term experimental warming and elevated CO2 manipulation at the DOE Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change (SPRUCE) site in the Marcell Experimental Forest, we have characterized the source of respired carbon used for both the production of CO2 and CH4. Samples were collected in early June, late July, and will be collected in early September from three large (~1.1 m2, ~0.5m3) chambers from the control plot, and two of the experimental plots selected for heating (+9°C, +4.5°C).\nEarly June fluxes from the three chambers were ~5500 mgC-m-2-d-1 and ~16 mgC-m-2-d-1 for CO2 and CH4 respectively. Radiocarbon analysis of CO2 and CH4 indicate that the source for the respired carbon is for the most part recent, with most 14C values between 30 and 40‰ – i.e., carbon that was photosynthetically fixed in the last few years. In concert with rising air and ground temperatures fluxes in late July increased to ~6500 mgC-m-2-d-1 and ~86 mgC-m-2-d-1. Although deep-heating was initiated in mid to late June we hypothesize that the July respiration signal is dominated by the regular seasonal cycle of natural warming.\nWe will present additional flux (September) and isotope (July, September) data and place the results in the context of next year’s experimental manipulations.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Tributary confluences may significantly impact large-scale patterns of sediment transport because of their role in connecting individual streams in a network. These unique locations feature complex flow structures and geomorphic features, and may represent ecological hotspots. Sediment transport across confluences is poorly understood, however. We present research on coarse sediment transport and dispersion through confluences using sediment tracers in the East Fork Bitterroot River, Montana, USA. We tagged a range of gravel (>40 mm) and cobble particles with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and painted smaller (10–40 mm) gravels, and then we traced them through confluences in a montane river’s headwaters. We measured the effects of confluences on dispersion, path length, and depositional location and compare properties of sediment routing with a non-confluence control reach. We also measured topographic change through repeat bed surveys and combined topography, hydraulics, and tracer measurements to calculate basal shear and critical Shields stresses for different grain sizes. Field observations suggest that tagged particles in confluences routed along flanks of scour holes in confluences, with sediment depositing further downstream along bank-lateral bars than within the channel thalweg. Travel distances of RFID-tagged particles ranged up to 35 meters from original seeding points, with initial recovery rates of RFID-tagged tracers ranging between 84-89%. In both confluence and control reaches only partial mobility was observed within the entire tracer population, suggesting a hiding effect imposed by the roughness of the bed. Particles seeded in the channel thalweg experienced further travel distances than those seeded towards the banks and on bars. Differences in dispersion between confluence and control reaches are implied by field observation. This study quantified patterns of sediment routing within confluences and provided insight to the importance of confluences in large-scale sediment transport through gravel-bed rivers.",

            "abstract": "Strike-slip fault zones have long been known for characteristic landforms such as offset and deflected rivers, linear strike-parallel valleys, and shutter ridges. Despite their common presence, questions remain about the mechanics of how these landforms arise or how their form varies as a function of slip rate, geomorphic process, or material properties. We know even less about what happens far from the fault, in drainage basin headwaters, as a result of strike-slip motion. Here we explore the effects of horizontal fault slip rate, bedrock erodibility, and hillslope diffusivity on river catchments that drain across an active strike-slip fault using the CHILD landscape evolution model. Model calculations demonstrate that lateral fault motion induces a permanent state of landscape disequilibrium brought about by fault offset-generated river lengthening alternating with abrupt shortening due to stream capture. This cycle of shifting drainage patterns and base level change continues until fault motion ceases thus creating a perpetual state of transience unique to strike-slip systems. Our models also make the surprising prediction that, in some cases, hillslope ridges oriented perpendicular to the fault migrate laterally in conjunction with fault motion. Ridge migration happens when slip rate is slow enough and/or diffusion and river incision are fast enough that the hillslopes can respond to the disequilibrium brought about by strike-slip motion. In models with faster slip rates, stronger rocks or less-diffusive hillslopes, ridge mobility is limited or arrested despite the fact that the process of river lengthening and capture continues. Fast-slip cases also develop prominent steep fault-facing hillslope facets proximal to the fault valley and along-strike topographic profiles with reduced local relief between ridges and valleys. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of strike-slip landscapes that vary systematically with a ratio of bedrock erodibility (K) and hillslope diffusivity (D) to the rate of horizontal advection of topography (v). These results also reveal a potential set of recognizable geomorphic signatures within strike-slip systems that should be looked to as indicators of fault activity and/or material properties.",

            "abstract": "In order to curb anthropogenic CO2 emissions, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology has been put forward as a way to achieve a large reduction in emissions by capturing CO2 at source, transporting it and injecting it into the subsurface for geological storage. Suitable formations considered for CO2 storage are depleted oil and gas fields, saline aquifers and coal seams. The former are particularly of interest due to the presence of an existing surface and subsurface infrastructure, detailed understanding of the reservoir-caprock system and low pore pressures prior to CO2 injection. However, prerequisite to ensuring safe, long-term storage of CO2is maintaining caprock integrity, by preventing fracturing of the caprock, as well as by ensuring stability of any pre-existing faults cutting the seal.\nMany potential depleted hydrocarbon fields under consideration for CCS, and most current CCS sites, are capped by shaly caprocks. The complex nature of this rock type, both mineralogically, hydraulically and mechanically, combined with the highly reactive properties of CO2-rich fluids, makes for an interesting, yet difficult, system to investigate. On the short-term, it has been shown that CO2 can lead to swelling of (swelling) clays present in the shale matrix, which may lead to the generation of outward-directed swelling forces. In addition, on the long-term (100-1000’s of years), CO2/brine/rock interactions may lead to mineralogical changes in the material. Such processes can lead to changes in the mechanical and frictional behavior of shale, which may or may not enhance loss of containment in response to the new state of stress resulting from CO2injection.\nWe studied the effect of these long-term chemical alterations on the mechanical properties of intact shale and clay-rich faults. Our study focused both on typical shale analogues, such as the Opalinus Clay (Mont Terri, Switzerland), as well as clay-rich caprock obtained from a natural CO2 field (Green River, Utah, USA), which was exposed to CO2 for > 400 ky. We performed mechanical experiments, using a novel technique, to study the behavior of intact, low permeability rocks, as well as shear experiments to understand the frictional stability of simulated fault gouges. This presentation will give an overview of the results obtained to date.",

            "abstract": "Coal is the largest fossil fuel resource in the United States. Most of this coal is deep in the subsurface making it costly and potentially dangerous to extract. However, in many of these deep coal seams, methane, the main component of natural gas, has been discovered and successfully harvested. Coal bed methane (CBM) currently accounts for approximately 7.5% of the natural gas produced in the U.S. Combustion of natural gas produces substantially less CO2 and toxic emissions (e.g. heavy metals) than combustion of coal or oil thereby making it a cleaner energy source. In the large coal seams of the Powder River Basin (PRB) in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, CBM is produced almost entirely by biogenic processes. The in situ conversion of coal to CBM by the native microbial community is of particular interest for present and future natural gas sources as it provides the potential to harvest energy from coal seams with lesser environmental impacts than mining and burning coal.\nResearch at Montana State University has shown the potential for enhancing the subsurface microbial processes that produce CBM. Long-term batch enrichments have investigated the methane enhancement potential of yeast extract as well as algal and cyanobacterial biomass additions with increased methane production observed with all three additions when compared to no addition. Future work includes quantification of CBM enhancement and normalization of additions. This presentation addresses the options thus far investigated for increasing CBM production and the next steps for developing the enhanced in situ conversion of coal to CBM.",

The generally clean character of renewable energies provides a great synergy and complimentary attribute for Native Americans’ respect and pride for the environment and the overarching concern for future generations (Council, Pierce et al. 2000). Furthermore, Native American cultures have a strong creative and artistic focus, often motivated by their respect and appreciation for nature.\nThe purpose of this learning-based research is to apply a cross-disciplinary approach to integrate the humanities with STEM research within the context of solar energy and climate literacy. Using 7 different learning styles (visual, aural, verbal, physical, logical, social, and solitary), students have the opportunity to showcase their research efforts through a variety of modes and artifacts including graphic novel development (Visual), spoken word poetry (Aural), conference presentation (Verbal), experiential display and demonstration (Physical), debate (Logical), social media and viral messaging (Social), and article submission (Solitary).",

Northern residents, and in particular, indigenous community residents, fully understand implications of the weather, however, a comment that has been heard more often is that old ways of knowing are not as reliable as they once were. Weather patterns seem less consistent and subject to more rapid fluctuations. Compromised traditional ways of knowing puts those who need to travel or hunt at greater risk. One response to adapt to this emerging reality is to make greater use of western sources of information, such as weather data and charts provided by NOAA's National Weather Service or Environment Canada. The federal weather agencies have very large and complex forecasting regions to cover, and so one problem is that it can be difficult to provide perfectly tailored forecasts, that cover all possible problems, right down to the very local scale in the communities. Only those affected have a complete feel for their own concerns. Thus, key to a strategy to improve the utility of available weather information is a linking of local-scale manifestations of problematic weather to the larger-scale weather patterns. This is done in two ways: by direct consultation with Northern residents, and by installation of equipment to measure parameters of interest to residents, which are not already being measured.\nThis talk will overview projects in coastal Alaska and Canada targeting this objective. The challenge of designing and conducting interviews, and then of harvesting relevant information, will be visited using examples from the three major contexts: coastal community, industrial, and operational. Examples of how local comments can be married to weather products will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Forests play a significant role in the global climate system in large part through their uptake and storage of atmospheric carbon. Biomass inventories provide valuable constraints on annual to decadal changes in forest carbon stocks through periodic, repeated measurements. However, this information offers limited utility for attribution of the major drivers and process-level mechanisms that determine forest carbon dynamics. A better understanding of these mechanisms is needed to project future forest carbon cycle dynamics, which requires the use of process-based modeling for attribution of and sensitivity to the major drivers.\nHere we compare and analyze recent estimates of the carbon budget of the world's forests based on national-level resource inventories against a suite of process-based model simulations run with a common protocol for formal inter-comparison. Our analysis of the model simulation experiments from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) suggests a large uncertainty in carbon cycle responses to these drivers, traceable primarily to the wide range in model structure relative to whether and how they represent the impacts of forest growth, management, disturbance and land use change. Although our study illustrates the benefits in retaining independence among the inventory and modeling estimates for comparison and benchmarking, progress toward a better understanding of the role of forests in the current and future global carbon cycle can also be made by more formally integrating these alternative but complementary scaling approaches.",

            "abstract": "The overall purpose of this research is to improve modeling capability, for large-scale hydrological models and land surface schemes. This aims to enhance understanding of the basin-scale modelling process, and advance representation of the flux exchange between the land surface and atmosphere for fully coupled atmosphere-land surface scheme modeling. The study is conducted on the Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB), which is a GEWEX Regional Hydroclimate Project and part of the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN). We applied and tested MESH (Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire – Surface and Hydrology), which is a Canadian hydrological modelling system based on the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), utilizing climate and assimilated remotely sensed data with ground-based observations.\n Targets of research are to 1) apply high resolution multiple climate forcing to enhance the representation of the alpine region; 2) refine the land surface modeling framework process representation through incorporating the annual and seasonal dynamic behavior of prairie pothole region streamflow contributing area; 3) implement the water storage and water abstraction dimension into the MESH modeling system to capture regulated catchments within the basin; 4) increase the parameter identifiability by introducing spatio-temporal multi-calibration of point and state variables against ground-based observation and remotely sensed data (for instance comparisons of modeled water storage change and soil moisture against GRACE and SMAP satellite products); 5) regionalize well-identified parameters to ungauged catchments assuming that the enhanced parameter identification reduces model uncertainty and the uncertainty that propagate in the process of parameter regionalization to ungauged catchments. The paper presents analysis of baseline model performance and strategic research needs, and reviews the scope for high resolution atmospheric models to improve representation of precipitation in the Canadian Rocky Mountain headwaters.",

            "abstract": "There is a continuing need within the operational space weather community, both civilian and military, for accurate, robust data assimilative specifications and forecasts of the global electron density field, as well as derived RF application product specifications and forecasts obtained from the electron density field. The spatial scales of interest range from a hundred to a few thousand kilometers horizontally (synoptic large scale structuring) and meters to kilometers (small scale structuring that cause scintillations). RF space weather applications affected by electron density variability on these scales include navigation, communication and geo-location of RF frequencies ranging from 100’s of Hz to GHz. For many of these applications, the necessary forecast time periods range from nowcasts to 1-3 hours. For more “mission planning” applications, necessary forecast times can range from hours to days.\nIn this paper we present a new ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) specification and forecast model being developed at JHU/APL based upon the well-known data assimilation algorithms Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four Dimensional (IDA4D) and Estimating Model Parameters from Ionospheric Reverse Engineering (EMPIRE). This new forecast model, “Forward Update Simple IONosphere model Plus IDA4D Plus EMPIRE (FUSION++), ingests data from observations related to electron density, winds, electric fields and neutral composition and provides improved specification and forecast of electron density. In addition, the new model provides improved specification of winds, electric fields and composition.\nWe will present a short overview and derivation of the methodology behind FUSION++, some preliminary results using real observational sources, example derived RF application products such as HF bi-static propagation, and initial comparisons with independent data sources for validation.",

In our unique model, we catalyze actionable science on pressing environmental issues such as climate change, and undertake comprehensive stakeholder engagement, public communication, and policy outreach. Built on more than 10 years of experience creating programs at the interface of science and policy at Hubbard Brook, Harvard Forest, and other LTER sites, we apply science communication research to practice in various ways depending on the context and problem being addressed.\nIn keeping with the research on co-production and the importance of establishing credibility, salience, and legitimacy, we engage stakeholders from the outset of each project. Stakeholders and scientists collaborate to define the scope of the project, frame questions relevant to society, and define communication products to meet their needs. To promote broader distribution and uptake, we combine message development, storytelling, and media training to craft and deliver relatable stories that tap into news values and human values. Three recent SPE successes include: (1) Wildlands and Woodlands: A regional forest conservation report released in 2010 that generated 137 media stories and influenced land conservation policy, (2) Changes to the Land: A suite of communication products developed in 2013 for a landscape scenarios project in Massachusetts that saturated the state’s media markets and have been widely cited by policymakers, and (3) Co-benefits of Carbon Standards: A national air quality report released in 2014 that was cited in 76 media stories and helped reframe the national debate on carbon dioxide emissions standards in terms of their potential local health and environmental benefits.\nWe will describe our successful applications of science communication research and discuss several critical disconnections between research and practice. These include, how much and what form of stakeholder engagement is most appropriate for a given project? How does the state of the science and the current policy context shape the pathways to impact and associated communication strategies?

            "abstract": "The advent of large area satellite coverage in the visible spectrum enabled satellite-based tracking of ice sheet flow just over twenty years ago. Following this, rapid development of techniques for imaging radar data enabled the wide-area mapping and time series coverage that SAR has brought to the documentation of changing ice discharge. We report on the maturation of feature tracking in visible-band satellite imagery of the ice sheets enabled by the high radiometric resolution and accurate geolocation delivered by Landsat 8, and apply this to mapping ice flow in the interiors of Antarctica and Greenland. The high radiometric resolution of Landsat 8 enables one to track subtle patterns on the surface of the ice sheet, unique at spatial scales of a few hundred meters, between images separated by multiple orbit cycles. In areas with significant dynamic topography generated by ice flow, this requires use of simple spatial filtering techniques first applied by Scambos et al. 1992. The result is densely sampled maps of surface motion that begin to rival the coverage available from SAR speckle tracking and interferometry. Displacement accuracy can approach one tenth of a pixel for reasonable chip sizes using conventional normalized cross-correlation; this can exceed the geolocation accuracy of the scenes involved, but coverage is sufficient to allow correction strategies based on very slow moving ice. The advance in radiometry, geo-location, and tracking tools is augmented by an increased rate of acquisition by Landsat 8. This helps mitigate the issue of cloud cover, as much of every 16-day orbit cycle over ice is acquired, maximizing the acquisition of clear-sky scenes. Using the correlation techniques common to IMCORR and later software, modern libraries, and single-cpu hardware, we are able to process full Landsat 8 scene pairs in a few minutes, allowing comprehensive analysis of ~1K available ice sheet image pairs in a few days.",

            "abstract": "Water utilities, reeling from increased impacts of successive extreme events such as floods, droughts, and derechos, are taking a more proactive role in preparing for future incursions. A recent study by Federal and water foundation investigators, reveals how six US water utilities and their regions prepared for, responded to, and coped with recent extreme weather and climate events and the lessons they are using to plan future adaptation and resilience activities.\nTwo case studies will be highlighted. (1) Sonoma County, CA, has had alternating floods and severe droughts. In 2009, this area, home to competing water users, namely, agricultural crops, wineries, tourism, and fisheries faced a three-year drought, accompanied at the end by intense frosts. Competing uses of water threatened the grape harvest, endangered the fish industry and resulted in a series of regulations, and court cases. Five years later, new efforts by partners in the entire watershed have identified mutual opportunities for increased basin sustainability in the face of a changing climate. (2) Washington DC had a derecho in late June 2012, which curtailed water, communications, and power delivery during a record heat spell that impacted hundreds of thousands of residents and lasted over the height of the tourist-intensive July 4th holiday. Lessons from this event were applied three months later in anticipation of an approaching Superstorm Sandy.\nThis study will help other communities in improving their resiliency in the face of future climate extremes. For example, this study revealed that (1) communities are planning with multiple types and occurrences of extreme events which are becoming more severe and frequent and are impacting communities that are expanding into more vulnerable areas and (2) decisions by one sector can not be made in a vacuum and require the scientific, sectoral and citizen communities to work towards sustainable solutions.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster required unprecedented engagement and collaboration with scientists from multiple disciplines across government, academia, and industry. Although this spurred the rapid advancement of valuable new scientific knowledge and tools, it also exposed weaknesses in the system of information dissemination and exchange among the scientists from those three sectors. Limited government communication with the broader scientific community complicated the rapid mobilization of the scientific community to assist with spill response, evaluation of impact, and public perceptions of the crisis. The lessons and new laws produced from prior spills such as Exxon Valdez were helpful, but ultimately did not lead to the actions necessary to prepare a suitable infrastructure that would support collaboration with non-governmental scientists. As oil demand pushes drilling into increasingly extreme environments, addressing the challenge of effective, science-based disaster response is an imperative.\nOur study employs a user-centered design process to 1) understand the obstacles to and opportunity spaces for effective scientific collaboration during environmental crises such as large oil spills, 2) identify possible tools and strategies to enable rapid information exchange between government responders and non-governmental scientists from multiple relevant disciplines, and 3) build a network of key influencers to secure sufficient buy-in for scaled implementation of appropriate tools and strategies. Our methods include user ethnography, complex system mapping, individual and system behavioral analysis, and large-scale system design to identify and prototype a solution to this crisis collaboration challenge.\nIn this talk, we will present out insights gleaned from existing analogs of successful scientific collaboration during crises and our initial findings from the 60 targeted interviews we conducted that highlight key collaboration challenges that government agencies, academic research institutions, and industry scientists face during oil spill crises. We will also present a synthesis of leverage points in the system that may amplify the impact of an improved collaboration strategy among scientific stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "Alfvén waves, a fundamental mode of magnetized plasmas, are ubiquitous in space plasmas. For example, a cascade of non-linearly interacting Alfvén waves is believed to play a key role in solar wind turbulence. At perpendicular length scales below the ion gyroradius, this takes the form of Kinetic Alfvén Waves (KAWs). Theoretical predictions show that these Alfvén waves may be unstable to various decay instabilities (e.g. [1,2]). In particular, theory predicts that a KAW may decay into two daughter KAWs even at very low amplitude (δB/B<10-3). Given the turbulent nature of solar wind observations and limited data-points, laboratory experiments may play a vital role in exploring the key physics responsible.\nThe present work, conducted at UCLA's Large Plasma Device (LAPD) represents the first fundamental laboratory study of the non-linear Alfvén wave interactions responsible for Alfvén wave decay instabilities. These experiments include the first laboratory observation of the Alfvén-acoustic mode coupling at the heart of the Parametric Decay Instability [3]. More recently, laboratory efforts have focused on the predicted non-linear decay of one KAW into two daughter KAWs. In these experiments, a single high-frequency ω/Ωi~0.7 Alfvén wave is launched, resulting in two daughter modes with frequencies and wave numbers that suggest co-propagating KAWs produced by decay of the pump wave. The observed process is parametric in nature, with the frequency of the daughter modes varying as a function of pump mode amplitude. Efforts are underway to fully characterize this set of experiments and compare with decay instabilities predicted by theory and simulations.\n[1] JV Hollweg, J. Geophys.

Spectra in this range are usually described as a succession of two spectral slopes separated by a spectral break around 0.5 Hz. Our statistical study focus on this transition area. Using the twin STEREO probes, launched in October 2006, we study a large amount of magnetic data extending from 2007 to 2013. Thanks to the high resolution magnetic field data provided by the MAG instrument, the spectrum can be computed over a wide frequency range (up to 4 Hz). We conducted a spectral analysis based on the wavelet transform technique using both Daubechies and Morlet wavelets. This analysis reveals some distinct spectral shape. The major part of the spectra are like the classical description with two spectral slopes separated by a transition area more or less well defined. But for around 1% of the spectra we observe clearly defined bump shape. This bump shape is the signature of left and right handed elliptically polarized waves. We compare those different shapes and show that the wave presence is correlated with a low level of turbulence. Furthermore, by combining these results with plasma parameters obtained via the PLASTIC instrument, we try to characterize those waves and discuss their possible origins.",

            "abstract": "Present-day variations in climate, such as drought, influence the physical and geochemical characteristics of cave drip waters. These changes in water chemistry, water flux, and climate through time may be preserved in cave calcite formations (speleothems). In 2011, a record drought began in central Texas, presenting an opportunity to assess the physical and geochemical response of cave drip waters. As part of a long-term cave monitoring study, drip water samples from eight sites in a cave on the Edwards Plateau were collected every 3 to 6 weeks before, during, and after the peak of the 2011 drought and analyzed for major and trace element concentrations. Physical parameters such as calcite growth rate, drip rate, and cave-air CO2 were also monitored.\nWe compare time series of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) with time series of drip rate, calcite growth rate, and water composition. The drip sites show a range of response to drought by these parameters and only some sites record drought via elemental ratios and growth rate. Both drip rate and drip water elemental ratios (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) provide insight into water residence time and flow paths within the vadose zone. All sites show some correspondence between drip rates and PDSI and three of the eight have a statistically significant relationship (r2=0.29-0.58, p<0.001). Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios for four out of eight drip sites were higher during drought than during wet periods, consistent with longer residence times and, as a result, more water-rock interaction during droughts. Calcite growth rates of fast dripping sites (mean drip rate greater than 4.5 mL/min) demonstrate a long-term decrease in response to drought. The complexity of drip site response is likely a consequence of the combined effects of prior calcite precipitation (PCP), water-rock interaction, seasonal ventilation of cave-air CO2, and water flux in the vadose zone. The results of this study improve our understanding of variations in the modern cave system due to drought and have implications for selecting speleothems as paleo-drought proxies.",

However, the linkages between geomorphology and ecology remain poorly understood. In rivers, the geomorphic template controls the hydraulic environment, partly shaping the river ecosystem. But what processes shape the geomorphic template? Here, I examine how two hillslope processes dominant in the Oregon Coast Range, debris flows and deep-seated landslides, affect valley floor width and channel slope, key components of the geomorphic template in riverine ecosystems. I then investigate how patterns in potential salmon habitat differ between eleven streams dominated by deep-seated landslides and eleven streams dominated by debris flows. I show that terrain influenced by deep-seated landslides exhibits (1) valley widths that are more variable throughout the network but less locally variable, (2) more variable channel slopes, and (3) more potential salmon habitat as well as significantly more connectivity between habitat types.",

However, drainage along with reduction and obstruction of flow has resulted in degradation of this ridged topography. The DECOMP Physical Model is a landscape-scale project aiming to reestablish natural sheetflow to the central and southern Everglades by redesigning barriers to flow. To validate proof of concept that increased flow will rebuild ridge-slough microtopography, biomarker proxies were established for ridge and slough organic matter sources. In addition, partial and complete canal backfill options were assessed via sediment trap accumulation in each backfill treatment area. Flocculent matter (floc) and sediment samples were collected, solvent extracted, chromatographically separated, and analyzed on a GC/MS using internal standard for quantification. Four molecular organic biomarkers were evaluated: the aquatic proxy (Paq), highly-branched isoprenoids (C20 HBI), kaurenes and botyrococcenes. Paq, an aquatic proxy of mid to long-chain n-alkanes, was shown to clearly differentiate between ridge-derived and slough-derived organic matter with Paq values increasing along ridge-to-slough transects. Kaurenes indicated presence of ridge-derived organic matter while C20 HBI and botyrococcenes were indicative of periphyton-derived organic matter which is commonly more abundant in sloughs. Biomarker distributions during both low (present day) and high (managed) water flow through the DECOMP experimental parcel were determined and discussed comparatively.",

Under the auspices of the Pliocene Modeling and Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP), general circulation models (GCM’s) are being employed to simulate mid-Pliocene climate to better understand the biases in these models, which are presently used to make future climate predictions. \nNecessary boundary conditions for these simulations — land mask, topography, surface albedo and vegetation cover are being provided by the Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) project. Bathymetry, which is not part of the PRISM supplied dataset has been adjusted by raising the sea-level by an assumed constant eustatic amount. At present the PRISM land mask, topography and bathymetry reconstructions do not incorporate the gravitationally self consistent changes that would be required to account for the mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets that produced the assumed rise in eustatic sea level. The effects of dynamic topography induced corrections, due to the action of the mantle convection process, have also been neglected.\nThe influence of these corrections on the predictions of Pliocene climate using modern GCM’s remains unexplored. The continuing failure of these models to simulate proxy inferred levels of warming in high-latitude [Dowsett et al., 2013, Sci. Rep.] regions where the magnitude of the required corrections are expected to be largest make it especially important that their impact be assessed. Here, we present the results from a preliminary of the required modifications to the boundary condition data sets.\nWe compute the gravitationally self consistent corrections using the viscoelastic theory of global, glacial isostatic adjustment and relative sea level history for a spherically symmetric Earth model. Dynamic topography related changes are computed using a 3D convection model initialized using seismic tomography. Together, this creates an updated picture of the mid-Pliocene shoreline, topography and bathymetry that can be employed as boundary conditions for future Pliocene climate modeling. ",

For each climate scenario, three sets of numerical experiments were configured: (1) a control experiment (CTRL) in which all crops are assumed to be rainfed; (2) an irrigation experiment (IRRIG) in which the irrigation module is activated; and (3) a groundwater pumping experiment (PUMP) in which a groundwater pumping scheme coupled with the irrigation module is activated. The parameters associated with irrigation and groundwater pumping were calibrated based on a global inventory of census-based SW and GW use compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).\nOur results suggest that irrigation could lead to two major opposing effects on SW/GW: SW depletion/GW accumulation in regions with irrigation primarily fed by SW, and SW accumulation/GW depletion in regions with irrigation fed primarily by GW. Furthermore, irrigation depending primarily on SW tends to have larger impacts on low-flow than high-flow conditions of SW, suggesting that intensive irrigation water use has the potential to further exacerbate low-flow conditions, increasing vulnerability to drought. By the end of the 21st century (2070-2099), climate change significantly increases (relative to 1971-2000) irrigation water demand in the regions equipped for irrigation across the world. The increase in demand combined with the increased temporal-spatial variability of water supply will cause more severe issues of local water scarcity for irrigation. Regionally, irrigation has the potential to aggravate climate-induced changes of SW/GW although the effects are negligible when averaged globally. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for irrigation effects and irrigation sources in regional climate change impact assessment.",

This system marks the termination of the largest marine-based portion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS; ~7 m sea level potential), yet little is known about its stability. Recent satellite data indicate regional ice thinning of TG/MUIS, possibly related to ocean-induced basal melt. However, the adjacent continental shelf was not comprehensively surveyed before NBP14-02 due to its remoteness and predominant sea ice cover.\nNBP14-02 scientists conducted physical-chemical, geophysical, and geological surveys of this practically unexplored region to evaluate recent and longer-term ocean-cryosphere linkages. Hydrographic measurements revealed southward transport of relatively warm subsurface waters from near the shelf break to the mid-shelf that weakened farther south near the ice shelf edge, contrary to initial hypotheses. Swath bathymetry mapped many glacial features, suggesting a complex regional glacial and deglacial history. We identified a network of channels scoured into bedrock that were spatially associated with glacial geoforms and may have formed during large subglacial meltwater outbursts. Over 750 km of high-resolution multichannel seismic data were acquired. Seismic profiles revealed the region’s geologic and climatologic history since the onset of Antarctic-Australian rifting, including evidence for: 1. fluvial deltaic systems, 2. intermittent glaciations, 3. the onset of persistent glaciation and significant ice loading, and 4. more recent glacial advance and retreat cycles. Coring and dredging operations, guided by geophysical data, enabled the collection of older sediments from outcropping unconformities and expanded Holocene sequences from restricted basins.\n The multidisciplinary nature of NBP14-02 enabled a rapid, but detailed, baseline assessment of a previously unexplored area. This approach was useful for introducing students to a broad range of oceanographic techniques and ideal for research expeditions subject to the unpredictable nature of the short Antarctic field season.",

            "abstract": "Subaqueous paleoseismological techniques have proved their potential to contribute to the paleoseismological investigations. Sedimentary records of past earthquakes have been mostly represented in lacustrine environments by multi-location coeval mass-wasting deposits and/or soft-sediment deformations. More recently, records of increased sediment influx due to seismically-triggered landslides in lake catchments have been explored by several researchers as well. The most commonly used argument in subaqueous paleoseismology is the temporal correlation between observed sedimentary events and historical earthquakes in the region. This requires precise and robust sediment chronologies, especially if the target is to evaluate earthquake recurrence. Here, we present lacustrine paleoseismological examples from the North Anatolian Fault (NAF, Turkey) and the Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF, Iceland). The examples from Turkey illustrate the application of regional time-stratigraphic correlations between proxy records to improve sediment chronologies. The sedimentary records of the lakes along the NAF were successfully correlated with the precisely dated cave deposits and varved lake sediments, which significantly improved the sediment chronologies. On the other hand, the investigations in Iceland benefit from the well-established tephrochronology in the region. Precise sediment chronologies do not only allow us to evaluate the long-term seismic behavior in a region (i.e., earthquake recurrence), but also to improve our understanding of the consequences of earthquakes on lacustrine sedimentation.",

Numerical simulations utilizing a fourth order turbulent closure transport scheme in a multi-layer soil-vegetation-atmosphere model, Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-Soil algorithm (ACASA), were used to explore snow model improvements in the physics-based parameterization for the Sierra Nevada Range. A set of alterations were made separately to the existing snowpack model within ACASA focusing on improvements to snow cover simulations on complex terrain slopes and over varying canopy cover. Three winter seasons were simulated; a climatological average, dry, and wet winter. The simulated output from the models are compared to observations to determine which model alterations made the largest improvements to snow simulations.",

            "abstract": "Light is of great importance to the health and ecological function of shallow estuaries. Primary production in such estuaries, which is typically dominated by seagrass, is contingent upon light penetration to the deeper part of the estuarine water column. A major component contributing to light attenuation in these systems is colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). CDOM is most often measured via a proxy, fluorescing dissolved organic matter (fDOM), due to the ease of taking rapid, accurate fDOM measurements. Fluorescence data can then be converted to absorbance by CDOM for use in light attenuation models. However, this fDOM-CDOM conversion has proven to be quite variable between estuaries, and even between sites along a given estuary. We displayed and attempted to explain this variability through the study of three diverse estuaries: West Falmouth Harbor (MA), Barnegat Bay (NJ), and Chincoteague Bay (MD/VA). Land use surrounding these estuaries ranges from wastewater treatment to agricultural operations and residential communities. Measurements of fDOM and absorbance by CDOM (quantified via spectrophotometer measurement of 0.2µm-filtered samples) were taken along a gradient from terrestrial to oceanic end-members. These measurements yielded highly variable fDOM-CDOM relationships between estuaries. The mean ratio of absorption coefficient at 340nm (m-1) to fDOM (QSU) was much higher in West Falmouth Harbor (0.874) than in Barnegat Bay (0.227) and Chincoteague Bay (0.173). This fDOM-CDOM relationship was also observed to be variable between sites within West Falmouth Harbor and Barnegat Bay, but consistent throughout sites along Chincoteague Bay. This variability, both within and between estuaries, is likely due to differing CDOM sources as a result of differences in land use in the areas surrounding these estuaries. Stable carbon isotope analysis of DOC from each site and hydrodynamic model results will be used to differentiate sources and further elucidate the fDOM-CDOM relationship.",

HySDS uses a heterogeneous set of worker nodes from private & public clouds as well as virtual & bare-metal machines to perform every aspect of the traditional science data system.\nFor our science data users, the forefront of HySDS is the facet search interface, FacetView, which allows them to browse, filter, and access the published products. Users are able to explore the collection of product metadata information and apply multiple filters to constrain the result set down to their particular interests. It allows them to download these faceted products for further analysis and generation of derived products. However, we have also employed a novel approach to faceting where it is also used to apply constraints for custom monitoring of products, system resources, and triggers for automated data processing.\nThe power of the facet search interface is well documented across various domains and its usefulness is rooted in the current state of existence of metadata. However, user needs usually extend beyond what is currently present in the data system. A user interested in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over Kilauea will download them from FacetView but would also want email notification of future incoming scenes. The user may even want that data pushed to a remote workstation for automated processing. Better still, these future products could trigger HySDS to run the user’s analysis on its array of worker nodes, on behalf of the user, and ingest the resulting derived products.\nWe will present our findings in integrating an ancillary, user-defined, system-driven processing system for HySDS that allows users to define faceted rules based on facet constraints and triggers actions when new SAR data products arrive that match the constraints. We will discuss use cases where users have defined rules for the automated generation of InSAR derived products: interferograms for California and Kilauea, time-series analyses, and damage proxy maps. These findings are relevant for science data system development of the proposed NASA-ISRO SAR mission.",

            "abstract": "A wide array of human-induced disturbances can alter the structure and function of forests, including climate change, disturbance and management. While there have been numerous studies on climate change impacts on forests, interactions of management with changing climate and natural disturbance are poorly studied. Forecasts of the range of plausible responses of forests to climate change and management are need for informed decision making on new management approaches under changing climate, as well as adaptation strategies for coming decades. Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) provide an excellent opportunity to investigate and assess simultaneous responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climatic perturbations and management across multiple spatio-temporal scales, but currently do not represent a wide array of management activities known to impact carbon, water, surface energy fluxes, and biodiversity.\nThe Ecosystem Demography model 2 (ED2) incorporates non-linear impacts of fine-scale (~10-1 km) heterogeneity in ecosystem structure both horizontally and vertically at a plant level. Therefore it is an ideal candidate to incorporate different forest management practices and test various hypotheses under changing climate and across various spatial scales. The management practices that we implemented were: clear-cut, conversion, planting, partial harvest, low intensity fire, restoration, salvage, and herbicide. The results were validated against observed data across 8 different sites in the U.S. Southeast (Duke Forest, Joseph Jones Ecological Research Center, North Carolina Loblolly Pine, and Ordway-Swisher Biological Station) and Pacific Northwest (Metolius Research Natural Area, H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Wind River Field Station, and Mount Rainier National Park). These sites differ in regards to climate, vegetation, soil, and historical land disturbance as well as management approaches. Results showed that different management practices could successfully and realistically be implemented in the ED2 model at a site level. Moreover, sensitivity analyses determined the most important processes at different spatial scales, and also those which could be ignored while minimizing overall error.",

Challenges in advection-based forecast techniques, such as forecasting near regions of non-wind-driven cloud systems such as coastal marine stratocumulus, are described, as are methods integrated into the forecast algorithm to identify and address these challenges.

            "abstract": "To balance the ocean’s uranium budget it may be necessary to invoke submarine groundwater discharge as a major source for uranium. However, uranium removal from seawater has been observed in coastal aquifers where steep redox gradients at the seawater-freshwater mixing zone result in the reduction of soluble U(IV) to insoluble U(IV). We investigated uranium cycling in groundwater within a permeable sand subterranean estuary in Waquoit Bay, MA using major and trace element chemistry as well as ∂234U measurements. Groundwater and sediment samples were collected across the seawater-freshwater mixing zone. In the groundwater samples uranium does not behave conservatively. During mixing it is removed in the intermediate salinities (3–4 m; 2–12 salinity; 0.1 nM U) and enriched in higher salinities (4–6 m; 20-25 salinity; 32 nM) while in salinities >25, uranium is again removed (7–8 m; 8 nM). Geochemical modeling suggests that U is removed at the seawater-freshwater interface by adsorption to Mn-oxides (3–4 m) while in the deeper saline aquifer (7–8 m), U is removed through reduction from U(VI) to U(IV). Surprisingly, while ∂234U is above secular equilibrium in both the freshwater and seawater, within the intermediate salinities ∂234U is depleted below secular equilibrium (as much as ∂234U = -50). Sediment samples were subjected to a partial leach to extract surface-exchangeable U. This leach was analyzed for ∂234U and found to be highly depleted (∂234U -80 – -20). Based on the depleted ∂234U of the sediment leaches and groundwater, we hypothesize that the high U concentrations observed within the intermediate salinities likely have a sediment source. This also implies that U within this intermediate salinity zone must have a long residence time relative to groundwater-surface water exchange rates. This might be possible if redox boundaries and Mn-oxides act as a barrier to U in the intermediate salinities allowing U leached from sediments to accumulate. Therefore, while we observe mechanisms for U removal and addition during submarine groundwater discharge, it appears that removal may be the dominant control with regards to the marine U budget. Finally, we have collected samples for ∂238U measurements which, when complete, may provide additional information on the mechanisms for U removal within the subterranean estuary.",

            "abstract": "This study presents the discovery of two sets of Archean fossil microorganisms (microfossils) and describes how such a study can be an analogue for a potential Martian sample return mission like that proposed as a follow up to the Mars 2020 mission. Microfossils are not easily preserved and their simple morphologies (made less distinct by taphonomy and diagenesis) can be confused with nonbiological structures. Thus, several lines of evidence are required for a biological interpretation of such remains. Despite this limitation, microfossils represent the most direct and easily illustrated evidence of life, and this will also be true of any microfossils that might be found on Mars. Martian sample return will provide the first chance to apply a full suite of analytical techniques to the study of possible Martian microfossils. Because such precious samples would be of limited quantity, this suite must include nondestructive techniques that are performed in situ and at a micron-scale.\nThe samples studied here were collected from two chert units within the Gamohaan Formation of the Kaapvaal Craton of South Africa. One set was collected from the Tsineng Member near the top of the formation and contains fossils of mat-forming filamentous microorganisms (~15–20 µm in diameter) that were buried in place. The other set comes from a chert bed stratigraphically lower within the Gamohaan Formation. This bed contains shriveled and somewhat compacted spherical microfossils (~100 µm in diameter) and are interpreted to be the remains of planktonic forms that settled from above. Cherts were collected based on a visual identification of their likelihood to contain microfossils. Optical microscopy was used to locate microstructures of interest within thin sections. The biological nature of these structures is supported by analyses of their three dimensional morphologies by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as well as their carbonaceous compositions by Raman spectroscopy. Raman and CLSM are nondestructive techniques that can be used to analyze specimens within rock to the depth of several tens of microns with no special sample preparation. Also, because Raman and CLSM can be used to study modern microorganisms, they are ideal techniques for the study of returned Martian samples that could contain either fossil or living material.",

The ensemble consists of about seventy 50-year long AMIP simulations performed with the GFDL model at 1x1 degree resolution.\nOur goal is to describe the dependence of the local precipitation climatology to the value of each parameter being perturbed in the ensemble; and we found that a quadratic dependence is appropriate for the entrainment in convective clouds (Fig.1a) with the quadratic term acting to compensate the effect of the linear term: the magnitude of the latter is in fact 20-30% larger and of opposite sign in all major convective areas in the Tropics. About 50% of the grid points show such behavior (Fig.1b) when an ensemble of initial conditions is employed.\nTo assess the impact of internal variability we repeated the analysis using only one run for each parameter value and found that the confidence with which the fitting parameters are established is strongly decreased: a difference in the magnitude of the reconstructed precipitation of about 10-30% is obtained, when precipitation is evaluated at the standard value of the entrainment coefficient (Fig.1c); and the number of grid points in which the null hypothesis of “no quadratic dependence” is rejected halves (Fig.1d).\nPreliminary results on the joint impact of internal variability and temporal span of the simulations indicate that an increased uncertainty of about 10% occurs when only 20 of the 50 years of simulations are considered.\nLastly, in exploring model optimization we found that a PPE often cannot be discerned from the internal variability in a simulation length of 50 years.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen and silicon isotope compositions of phytolith silica preserved in soils can be used to examine past climate and biogeochemical cycles. The δ18O values of phytoliths vary with temperature and the δ18O values of formation water while the δ30Si values of phytoliths depend on silicon availability and weathering rates. However, further investigation into the stability of opal-A phytoliths in soils is necessary, as post-depositional alteration of biogenic silica may alter the isotopic composition and affect paleoenvironmental reconstruction.\nThe effects of partial dissolution on the oxygen- and silicon-isotope composition of phytoliths was assessed through dissolution experiments in silicic acid-free water at a range of temperature (4-44°C) and pH conditions (4–10). After 3-30% dissolution, concurrent oxygen and silicon isotope analyses were obtained for the remaining opal-A. Over the course of the experiments oxygen and silicon isotope values of solid silica changed by up to +4.4 ‰ and +0.55 ‰, respectively. Under most conditions δ30Si values increased during early dissolution, followed by a decrease as dissolution progressed until δ30Si values were similar to, or in extreme cases, lower than the original unaltered phytoliths. This might indicate that both dissolution and re-precipitation contribute to the isotopic composition of the altered phytoliths. Changes in δ18O values of the phytoliths follow a similar pattern. We propose that the outer, reactive surface of a fresh phytolith is depleted of 30Si and 18O relative to the rest of the sample. A decrease in surface area suggests that removal of this layer accounts for the initial increase in δ30Si and δ18O values during early dissolution. Extended reaction times result in lower isotopic values and an unexpected decease in aqueous Si suggesting precipitation or exchange occurs.\nThis study improves our understanding of the role of terrestrial biogenic silica in global Si cycle. Post-depositional change in the isotopic composition of phytoliths complicates paleoclimate models but does not preclude their use if the isotopic alteration of the surface layer can be accounted for, or the altered surface layer can be removed prior to analyses. Like diatoms, phytoliths preserved in sediments likely have already lost their reactive surface layer.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: The Space Launch System (SLS) is the most powerful rocket ever built and provides a critical heavy-lift launch capability. We present mission concepts relevant to NASA’s Cislunar Proving Ground and the Global Exploration Roadmap (GER).\nAsteroid Redirect Mission (ARM): ARM in part is a mission to the lunar vicinity. The ARM mission requirements result in system design based on a modified version of our 702 spacecraft. Including a NASA Docking System (NDS) on the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle allows for easier crewed exploration integration and execution.\nExploration Augmentation Module (EAM): Crew operations at a redirected asteroid could be significantly enhanced by providing additional systems and EVA capabilities beyond those available from the Orion only. An EAM located with the asteroid would improve the science and technical return of the asteroid mission while also increasing Orion capability through resource provision and providing an abort location and safe haven for contingencies. The EAM could be repurposed as a cislunar exploration platform that advances scientific research, enables lunar surface exploration and provides a deep space vehicle assembly and servicing site. International Space Station (ISS) industry partners have been working for the past several years on concepts for using ISS development methods and assets to support a broad range of missions. These concepts have matured along with planning details for NASA’s SLS and Orion for a platform located in the Earth-Moon Libration (EML) system or Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO).\nLunar Surface: The mission objectives are to provide lunar surface access for crew and cargo and to provide as much reuse as possible. Subsequent missions to the surface can reuse the same lander and Lunar Transfer Vehicle.\nMars Vicinity: The International space community has declared that our unified horizon goal is for a human mission to Mars. Translunar infrastructure and heavy lift capability are key to this approach. The moons of Mars would provide an excellent stepping stone to the surface. As a “shake-down” cruise before landing, a mission to Deimos or Phobos would test all of the systems except those needed to get to the surface and back. This test would provide confidence for the in-space transportations and crew habitat systems.",

            "abstract": "Reliable and cost-efficient reservoir surveillance techniques play an important role in the context of geological carbon dioxide storage. Electrical methods are particularly suited to image the displacement of highly conductive formation fluids by a more resistive CO2 plume. At the Ketzin site close to Berlin, Germany, a permanent installation of 45 ring-shaped stainless steel electrodes distributed in an injection well and two observation wells is in operation since the start of injection in June 2008. The depth of the installation intervals in the three wells ranges from 590 m to 735 m. Based on our practical experience after more than five years of injection (until August 2013), we draw conclusions with regard to the usefulness and versatility of such an electrode array as well as associated challenges under the aspect of technical longevity.\nWith regard to future installations, we present an experimental design approach to estimate optimum electrode locations along the borehole trajectories with the objective to maximize the resolution within a prescribed target horizon. Our results show that a sparse but well-conceived set of electrodes with a refinement of the electrode spacing in the target region can provide a large portion of the information content offered by very dense electrode layouts. Using Ketzin as a case study for realistic CO2 plume migration, we compare the optimized layout to the existing equidistant installation at Ketzin with a focus on the offered resolution and the inversion performance. The presented results can assist practitioners in the design of reliable and cost-efficient monitoring systems for future underground storage sites.",

            "abstract": "Rising sea-level over the next century will reshape our coastlines and make low-lying islands more vulnerable to extreme events. Atolls could potentially provide unique geologic records from periods of high sea level analogous to those we might experience over the coming centuries. However, sea-level records from atolls have been largely overlooked, in part because the processes that shape coral reef and atoll form are often complex and, in many cases, remain unexplored. Darwin’s canonical model, which proposes an evolution from fringing reef to barrier reef to atoll as an ocean island ages and subsides, cannot explain the stratigraphy or morphology of many island reefs.\nWe will present a study that combines a numerical model of reef development with existing stratigraphic records from Pacific atolls. The model, driven by sea level, simulates the evolution of atoll morphology using parameterizations of coral growth, rim derived sediment and in situ production, dissolution, and subsidence. We use it to solve for late-Miocene to present sea level by iteratively changing the ice volume and deep-ocean temperature corrections for converting deep-ocean, benthic, δ18O to sea level and finding the best-fit between the model output and corelog stratigraphy from Enewetak Atoll. We then compare lagoon depths produced by the model for different island sizes and dissolution rates (but the same subsidence and sediment production rates) to an independent dataset of real-world observations from the Marshall, Gilbert and Caroline Island chains. Our model results suggest that a period of sustained low sea level occurred during the late Miocene before rising above present moving into the Pliocene. We propose that it was atoll exposure and enhanced lagoon dissolution during the subsequent sea-level fall since the late Pliocene, ~2.7 Ma – not crustal subsidence, as Darwin’s canonical model of atoll evolution presumes – that likely drove the development of modern rimmed atoll morphology.",

            "abstract": "The Mexico City Metropolitan Area is the largest urban center in the American continent, with 20.4 millions of inhabitants, representing 17.8% of the total population of the country. Over the past several decades Mexico City has been experienced rapid subsidence, up to ~370 mm/yr, caused by groundwater extraction. The subsidence rate is inhomogeneous, as it controlled by the local geology. Unconsolidated sediments tend to compact and induce rapid subsidence, whereas subsurface volcanic rocks are less prone to subsidence. Intensive faulting in the city has been observed in areas of differential deformation; in these areas buildings and infrastructure are highly damaged. Quantification of subsidence-induce damage is needed for establishing the magnitude of the phenomenon.\nOur study uses three data sources: a satellite-derived subsidence map, census information of population distribution for 2010, and information on buildings and infrastructure. The subsidence map was calculated from 29 SAR scene acquired by the Envisat satellite during the years 2003-2010 using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) method with the SqueeSAR algorithm. The information of the census of population comes from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), which also provides the information about infrastructure. We intersected the information from the three maps using a geographic information system (GIS), which cover an area of 1, 640 km2. As subsidence-induced damage occurs mainly in areas of differential subsidence, we based the GIS analysis on the subsidence gradients, rather than subsidence rates. In order to evaluate subsidence-induced faulting risk, we generated a risk matrix that worked as the main parameter to create a risk map. We then reclassified the urban area into 5 zones according to the related risk, with R0 for the lowest risk and R4 for the highest. Our counting showed that 350 km2 of the city is located in an urban area of high to very high risk, which represents 21.7 % of the total area. These areas include ~5.8 millions of inhabitants, which are 34.5% of the total population in Mexico City.",

            "abstract": "Geologic weathering processes in cold environments, especially subglacial chemical processes acting on rock and sediment, are not well characterized due to the difficulty of accessing these environments. Glacial weathering of geologic materials contributes to the solute flux in meltwater and provides a potential source of energy to chemotrophic microbes, and is thus an important component to understand. In this study, we use Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data to map the extent of glacial weathering in the front range of the Canadian Rockies using remotely detected infrared spectra. We ground-truth our observations using laboratory infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and geochemical analyses of field samples. The major goals of the project are to quantify weathering inputs to the glacial energy budget, and to link in situ sampling with remote sensing capabilities.\nRobertson Glacier, Alberta, Canada is an excellent field site for this technique as it is easily accessible and its retreating stage allows sampling of fresh subglacial and englacial sediments. Infrared imagery of the region was collected with the ASTER satellite instrument. At that same time, samples of glacially altered rock and sediments were collected on a downstream transect of the glacier and outwash plain. Infrared laboratory spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction were used to determine the composition and abundance of minerals present. Geochemical data were also collected at each location, and ice and water samples were analyzed for major and minor elements. Our initial conclusion is that the majority of the weathering seems to be occurring at the glacier-rock interface rather than in the outwash stream.\nResults from both laboratory and ASTER data indicate the presence of leached weathering rinds. A general trend of decreasing carbonate abundances with elevation (i.e. residence time in ice) is observed, which is consistent with increasing calcium ion meltwater concentrations towards the glacier terminus. These results are used to map the extent of regional glacial chemical weathering using ASTER thermal imagery.",

            "abstract": "Slip on faults occurs within very fine–grained granular gouge created by the comminution of highly fractured country rock. Due to this process of fracturing and grinding into powder, the permeability within these gouge zones naturally varies across their width, with the gouge material having relatively low permeability compared to the surrounding damage zone of fractured rock. During shear, the movement of individual grains creates local transient dilations and compactions that generate variations in fluid pressure and gouge permeability. The resulting fluid circulation, controlled by differing permeabilities across the fault, may determine aspects of the evolution of slip, such as at what position individual shear bands will materialize.\nIn order to investigate these phenomena, we extend the coupled discrete element / continuum numerical model of grain motion and fluid flow (Goren et al., 2011) to include fluid flow in the surrounding permeable fault block. We conducted numerical experiments with unconsolidated gouge confined between fault blocks. This system was held at a constant confining stress, and sheared at a constant rate similar to earthquake velocities (on the order of 1 m/s). We find that shear localizes into bands about 10 grains wide, and these bands prefer to form where they will create the least deviations in pressure, i.e. where permeability is highest. Preliminary results with a rigid, fixed-permeability fault block reveal a clear relationship between localization and fault block permeability. When the fault block has low permeability relative to the gouge, shear bands tend to form towards the interior of the gouge. When the fault block is more permeable, shear band formation tends to occur near the boundary between gouge and fault block. We see no further increase in boundary localization for fault block permeabilities on the order of 100 times the gouge permeability.\nWe will also present results from a version of the model in which the wall rock surrounding the gouge is an elastic/plastic damage zone created from cohesively bonded grains. This allows a greater degree of wall roughness, more lateral variability in wall stresses, and a heterogeneous and evolving damage zone permeability.",

            "abstract": "While Python continues to grow in popularity as a convenient and powerful means of data manipulation and analysis, the language still lacks a package that provides easy access to commonly utilized geostatistical routines. PyKrige is a new contribution that attempts to create a Python library that can be used for basic geostatistical tasks, such as creating water level maps using Ordinary and Universal Kriging. While written in pure Python, the code makes extensive use of NumPy in order to enable fast processing. Supported drift terms for Universal Kriging currently include a regional linear drift (such as would be used to simulate an overall groundwater gradient, as discussed in Tonkin and Larson, Groundwater, 2002), a point-logarithmic drift (such as would be used to simulate wells, as discussed in Tonkin and Larson, Groundwater, 2002), and an external digital elevation model drift (such as would be used to simulate a topographically controlled groundwater surface, as discussed in Desbarats et al., Journal of Hydrology, 2002). The package is intended primarily for kriging of two-dimensional data, but limited support for three-dimensional kriging is currently under development. Though similar tools already exist for other commonly utilized scientific languages, such as R and MATLAB, PyKrige is intended to ease data processing by providing further functionality in Python that can be implemented in a single analysis pipeline. The code will be made available on GitHub.",

            "abstract": "In November and December 2013, the Marche region (Central Italy) was hit by three severe, but not rare, meteorological events. The maximum value of the three days cumulative rainfall (499 mm) was recorded at the rain gauge of Pintura di Bolognola. The intense rainfall caused floods along the rivers and triggered numerous landslides, mostly located in the hilly and mountainous terrain of the region. The territory is crossed by a large number of roads connecting small rural settlements. After the events, the Regional Civil Protection Office requested to the Research Institute for the geo-hydrological Protection (IRPI-CNR) a technical support to evaluate the hazard condition for different sites affected by landslides. For an area of approximately 200 km2, in the Municipalities of Acquasanta Terme and Roccafluvione, field surveys were carried out to identify the rainfall-induced landslides and to produce an event inventory map. More than 1,500 slope failures were mapped including earth flows, slide-earth flows, slides, rock-falls and complex slides. Field surveys were focused also to estimate qualitatively damages along the roads. Roads were classified in two classes: the main roads under the State responsibility and the secondary roads under the Municipality responsibility. The different types of damage were classified in three classes: i) aesthetic (minor), where the road functionality was not compromised; ii) functional (medium), where the functionality was compromised and iii) structural (severe) where roads are severely or completely damaged. Immediately after the event, the technicians of the Municipalities of Acquasanta Terme and Roccafluvione spent major efforts to partially restore the functionality of the secondary roads in order to guarantee the primary human needs. In the following ten days, they compiled a list of interventions, associated with the relative direct costs, aimed to the total restoration of the roads functionality. In collaboration with the technicians, we compared the estimate of the damages along the roads with the cost evaluation provided by the local authorities. The comparison allowed us to quantify the impact of the landslide events along the transportation infrastructures and to quantify the total direct cost for the secondary roads where the information was available.",

            "abstract": "A group of interested and multifaceted faculty, administrators and students created the Science, Engineering, Arts Committee (SEA Change) two years ago at the University of Florida (UF). Recognizing that innovative ideas arise from the convergence of divergent thinkers, the committee seeks to bring together faculty in Science, Engineering, the Arts and others across campus to develop and disseminate innovative ideas for research, teaching and service that will enhance the campus intellectual environment. We meet regularly throughout the year as faculty with graduate and undergraduate students to catalyze ideas that could lead to collaborative or interdisciplinary projects and make recommendations to support innovative, critical and creative work. As an example, the Department of Geological Sciences and the School of Art and Art History collaborated on a competition among UF undergraduate painting students to create artistic works that related to geoscience. Each student gathered information from Geological Sciences faculty members to use for inspiration in creating paintings along with site-specific proposals to compete for a commission. The winning work was three-story high painting representing rock strata and the Florida environment entitled “Prairie Horizontals” that is now installed in the Geoscience building entrance atrium. Two smaller paintings of the second place winner, depicting geologists in the field were also purchased and displayed in a main hallway.\nOther activities supported by SEA Change have included a collaborative work of UF engineering and dance professors who partnered for the Creative Storytelling and Choreography Lab, to introduce basic storytelling tools to engineering students. A campus-wide gathering of UF faculty and graduate students titled Creative Practices: The Art & Science of Discovery featured guest speakers Steven Tepper, Victoria Vesna and Benjamin Knapp in spring 2014. The Committee plans to develop and foster ideas that will lead to more collaborative or interdisciplinary projects and make recommendations to the administration to support a creative environment across disciplines on UF campus.",

            "abstract": "The intermediate depth earthquakes of high moment magnitude (Mw ≥ 8) in Chile have had a relative greater impact in terms of damage, injuries and deaths, than thrust type ones with similar magnitude (e.g. 1939, 1950, 1965, 1997, 2003, and 2005). Some of them have been studied in details, showing paucity of aftershocks, down-dip tensional focal mechanisms, high stress-drop and subhorizontal rupture. At present, their physical mechanism remains unclear because ambient temperatures and pressures are expected to lead to ductile, rather than brittle deformation. We examine source characteristics of more than 100 intraslab intermediate depth earthquakes using local and regional waveforms data obtained from broadband and accelerometers stations of IPOC network in northern Chile. With this high quality database, we estimated the total radiated energy from the energy flux carried by P and S waves integrating this flux in time and space, and evaluated their seismic moment directly from both spectral amplitude and near-field waveform inversion methods. We estimated the three parameters Ea, τa and M0 because their estimates entail no model dependence. Interestingly, the seismic nest studied using near-field re-location and only data from stations close to the source (D<250km) appears to not be homogeneous in terms of depths, displaying unusual seismic gaps along the Wadati-Benioff zone. Moreover, as confirmed by other studies of intermediate-depth earthquakes in subduction zones, very high stress drop ( >> 10MPa) and low radiation efficiency in this seismic nest were found. These unusual seismic parameter values can be interpreted as the expression of the loose of a big quantity of the emitted energy by heating processes during the rupture. Although it remains difficult to conclude about the processes of seismic nucleation, we present here results that seem to support a thermal weakening behavior of the fault zones and the existence of thermal stress processes like thermal shear runaway as a preferred mechanism for intermediate earthquake triggering. Despite the non-exhaustive aspect of this study, data presented here lead to the necessity of new systematic near-field studies to obtain valuable conclusions and constrain more accurately the physics of rupture mechanisms of these intermediate-depth seismic event.",

            "abstract": "Dating the youngest phase of metamorphic or magmatic zircon growth by in-situ techniques on sectioned zircons can be challenging when rims are only a few microns thick; in the worst case, geologically meaningless measurements result from mixing between different age and/or compositional growth domains. This is especially true for zircons from the Zanskar Shear Zone and Tso Morari UHP Complex, NW Himalaya, which contain Eocene to Miocene rims that grew over Paleozoic and Proterozoic protolith cores during peak and retrograde metamorphism. These metamorphic rims are typically only 0.5 to 3.0 microns thick and require high-spatial resolution to resolve. We used the SHRIMP-RG ion-microprobe to perform new U-Pb depth-profiling analyses on zircon surfaces (non-polished) pressed into indium metal. Zircons from a leucogranite dike from Malung Tokpo along the Zanskar Shear Zone, which have 2000-5000 ppm U rims, were selected for detailed depth-profiling to evaluate the depth-resolution by SIMS for U-Pb and trace element analyses. Due to the high U concentration, we were able to decrease the primary beam intensity (sputter rate) and the count times for U and Pb isotopes, and increase the number of cycles through the run-table (45 peak-hopping scans). As a result, each cycle yielded a 0.04 micron depth-resolved zircon age and trace element composition. The youngest 13 scans yielded a U-Pb age of 21.3 ± 0.5 Ma, representing a 0.6 micron rim with uniform U, Th, and Hf concentrations. At 1.15 microns, the primary beam sputtered into a ~600 Ma core; this older age is complicated by the fact that it reflects mixing between the bottom of the sputter volume and the Miocene ages of the pit margins and rim, because the diameter of the spot tends to increase with time. Trace element analyses on zircon surfaces from the Tso Morari UHP Complex are highly reproducible, showing enriched HREE profiles with negative Eu anomalies – a result that is difficult to reproduce by analyses of sectioned crystals.",

            "abstract": "Fractures in porous media provide preferential pathways for flow and solute transport. Their hydraulic properties are critical parameters for determining fluid migration and leakage, and are subject to alterations when exposed to reactive flow, e.g. CO2-acidfied brine in the case of carbon storage. Our previous studies have shown how mineral heterogeneity could lead to increased roughness that mitigates the increase in fracture permeability. This study shows that, even in rocks with mineral homogeneity, fracture geometry is subject to complex alterations. In this presentation, we report an experimental study of CO2-acidified brine in fractured Indiana Limestone, with comprehensive characterization of effluent chemistry analyzed by ICP-OES, and 3D geometry evolution using micro-computed topography (xCT). Significant carbonate dissolution was observed but the reaction extent revealed by the effluent chemistry was less than what was predicted by simple reaction transport models. xCT imaging revealed the formation of wormhole channels in the fracture, and the channels grew larger downstream and more prominent over time. Using the fracture geometries derived from the xCT images, we simulated the flow field and inferred the evolution of fracture hydraulic properties. To interpret the process of wormholing and its impacts on fracture hydraulic properties, we used reactive transport modeling to simulate the interplay between fracture geometry, fluid flow and geochemical reactions. Our simulations predicted that wormholes were formed in fractures with initial roughness representative of natural subsurface systems. The presence of wormholes caused a disproportionately larger permeability increase than would be expected given the extent of volume change. ",

The amounts of the different components in each particle and the particle morphologies will impact the CCN activity and the radiative properties of the aerosol population. A recent parameterization of the mixing state developed by Nicole Riemer and Matthew West provides a clear transition between ambient measurements of aerosol components and particle mixing states employed in climate models. Single particle spectro-microscopy techniques including scanning transmission x-ray microscopy/near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS) and computer controlled scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (CCSEM/EDX) are used to measure the composition of aerosol particles from the CARES campaign at both T0 and T1. Here, we present results from the application of the per particle composition to a parameterization of the mixing state and provide constraints on the mixing state of ambient aerosol particles. The two microscopy techniques yield complementary information on the mixing state of the aerosol populations; STXM/NEXAFS provides information on the mixing state of the organic fraction while CCSEM/EDX provides information on the inorganic fraction.",

With CO2 levels today around 400ppm, we are clearly committed to far more climate change, both in the near term, and well beyond our children’s future. A key question is how that change will occur. Abrupt climate changes are those that exceed our expectations, preparedness, and ability to adapt. Such changes challenge us economically, physically, and socially. This talk will draw upon results from ice core research over the past twenty years, as well as a new NRC report on abrupt climate change in order to address abrupt change, as seen in the past in ice cores, as seen today in key environmental systems upon which humans depend, and what is may be coming in the future.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that the atmospheric Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) can display distinct regimes of flow. In the weakly stable boundary layer, turbulence is weak but continuous and the surface flow is coupled to that aloft. In the very stable boundary layer, turbulence collapses and the surface flow becomes decoupled from the flow above.\nThis study demonstrates the clear presence of two distinct SBL regimes in a long record of observations from the 213m tower in Cabauw, Netherlands. These regimes are found in the joint distribution of near-surface stratification, shear, and vertically-averaged wind speed. Hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis is used to distinguish these regimes and objectively classify states as being in one regime or the other. This classification allows for a detailed diagnosis of the flow, stratification, and turbulence structures within each of the two regimes, as well as their relation to large-scale forcing through the geostrophic wind and cloud cover. Observational evidence is presented that the very stable boundary layer is produced by a previously-discussed positive feedback associated with a maximum sustainable turbulent heat flux.",

            "abstract": "The persistence of dense-non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs) in the subsurface has led practitioners and regulatory agencies to turn towards low-maintenance, low-cost remediation methods. Biological degradation has been suggested as a possible solution, based on the well-proven ability of certain microbial species to break down dissolved chlorinated ethenes under favorable conditions. However, the biodegradation of pure phase chlorinated ethenes is subject to additional constraints: the continuous release of electron acceptor at a rate governed by mass transfer kinetics, and the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of DNAPL source zones which leads to spatially and temporally variable availability of the reactants for reductive dechlorination. In this work, we investigate the relationship between various DNAPL source zone characteristics and reaction kinetics using COMPSIM, a multiphase groundwater model that considers non-equilibrium mass transfer and Monod-type kinetics for reductive dechlorination. Numerical simulations are performed for simple, homogeneous trichloroethene DNAPL source zones to demonstrate the effect of single source zone characteristics, as well as for larger, more realistic heterogeneous source zones. It is shown that source zone size, and mass transfer kinetics may have a decisive effect on the predicted bio-enhancement. Finally, we evaluate the performance of DNAPL bioremediation for realistic, thermodynamically constrained, concentrations of electron donor. Our results indicate that the latter may be the most important limitation for the success of DNAPL bioremediation, leading to reduced bio-enhancement and, in many cases, comparable performance with water flooding.",

            "abstract": "Chemical weathering of the continents plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and delivers solutes to the ocean. Past studies, documented using radiogenic isotopes of detrital and seawater samples, show the intensity of weathering varies with climate over a range of time scales.. We analyzed Pb and Nd isotopic values of seawater extracted from dispersed Fe-Mn oxides, <2µm (clay) and <63µm (silt) detrital fractions of Pliocene to Holocene sediment from Gulf of Mexico ODP Site 625B to evaluate long term variations in weathering fluxes for three time slices: the Pliocene/early Pleistocene, Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT), and late Pleistocene/Holocene. We also examine short term glacial/interglacial variations.\nLittle variation is seen in Nd isotopes of detrital fractions with age, suggesting little change in the average age of material delivered to the Gulf. Seawater Nd values become less radiogenic over the Pleistocene, consistent with observed changes in Caribbean seawater. Pb isotopes of silt fractions are also relatively constant through time, but clay fractions are more radiogenic at the MPT and dispersed Fe-Mn oxides trend to more radiogenic values in the late Pleistocene. Consequently, the Pb isotopes of dispersed Fe-Mn oxides tend to be less radiogenic than the detrital fractions in samples older than 2000 ka and more radiogenic than the detrital fractions, particularly clays, at the MPT. This may reflect greater incongruent silicate weathering during the MPT, a change in weathering conditions that could be consistent with the Regolith Hypothesis.\nOver glacial/interglacial timescales, dispersed Fe-Mn oxides Pb isotopes become more radiogenic than detrital fractions, and clay fractions become more radiogenic than silt fractions, during glacial periods. However, all fractions have similar values during interglacials. This pattern is distinct from previous studies that found enhanced incongruent silicate weathering during warm intervals, but is consistent with recent work finding a correlation with carbonate content, whereby low carbonate during glacials at Site 625 corresponds to a greater offset between leachate and detrital Pb isotopes. Biases from “heavy mineral effects” and changes in circulation during periods of lower sea level also need to be considered.",

            "abstract": "Regional water supply systems undergo surplus and deficit conditions due to differences in inflow characteristics as well as due to their seasonal demand patterns. This study presents a framework for regional water management by proposing an Inter-Basin Transfer (IBT) model that uses climate-information-based inflow forecast for minimizing the deviations from the end- of-season target storage across the participating reservoirs. Using the ensemble streamflow forecast, the IBT water allocation model was applied for two reservoir systems in the North Carolina Triangle area. Results show that inter-basin transfers initiated by the ensemble streamflow forecast could potentially improve the overall water supply reliability as the demand continues to grow in the Triangle Area. To further understand the utility of climate forecasts in facilitating IBT under different spatial correlation structures between inflows and between the initial storages of the two systems, a synthetic experiment was designed to evaluate the framework under inflow forecast having different skills. Findings from the synthetic study can be summarized as follows: (a) Inflow forecasts combined with the proposed IBT optimization model provide improved allocation in comparison to the allocations obtained under the no- transfer scenario as well as under transfers obtained with climatology; (b) Spatial correlations between inflows and between initial storages among participating reservoirs could also influence the potential benefits that could be achieved through IBT; (c) IBT is particularly beneficial for systems that experience low correlations between inflows or between initial storages or on both attributes of the regional water supply system. Thus, if both infrastructure and permitting structures exist for promoting inter-basin transfers, season-ahead inflow forecasts could provide added benefits in forecasting surplus/deficit conditions among the participating reservoirs in the regional water supply system.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the use of synchrotron radiation for elemental imaging within the skeleton of a Porites coral from American Samoa to explore the fine-scale structure of strontium to calcium (Sr/Ca) variability. The use of a synchrotron for coral paleoclimate analysis is relatively new. The method provides a high resolution, two-dimensional elemental map of a coral surface. The aragonitic skeleton of Porites sp. colonies has been widely used for paleoclimate reconstruction as the oxygen isotope ratio (δ18O) signal varies with both sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). Sr/Ca has been used in previous studies in conjunction with δ18O to deconvolve SST from SSS, as Sr/Ca in the coral skeleton varies with SST, but not SSS. However, recent studies suggest that in some cases Sr/Ca variability in coral does not reliably reflect changes in SST. We sought to address this puzzle by investigating Sr/Ca variability in Porites corals at a very fine spatial scale while also demonstrating the suitability of the synchrotron as a coral analysis tool. We also considered Sr/Ca variability as it pertains to the coral’s structural elements. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center synchrotron station generates collimated x-rays in the energy range of 4500-45000 eV with beam diameters as small as 20 μm. Synchrotron imaging allows faster and higher-resolution Sr/Ca analysis than does inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It also is capable of mapping spatial distributions of many elements, which aids in the development of a multiproxy approach to paleoclimate reconstruction. Imaging and analysis of the Porites coral using synchrotron radiation revealed an intricate sub-seasonal Sr/Ca signal, possibly correlating to a sub-monthly resolution. This signal, which seems unrelated to SST, dominates the annual signal.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative characterization of earthquake clustering in space and time in relation to different event sizes and physical properties of the lithosphere are fundamental problems of statistical seismology. Recently, we approached these problems by taking advantage of the new statistical results, improved empirical constraints, and relatively uniform high-quality earthquake catalogs available for southern California and other selected regions. This led to identification and classification of statistically significant earthquake clusters in southern California, relating cluster characteristics to effective viscosity of the crust, and documenting some robust properties of observed earthquakes not simulated by the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. Extending these results to other seismically active areas and lower magnitude ranges, however, is impeded by inferior data quality. Most available catalogs are based on non-uniform recordings/analyses that lead to non-uniform (in space, time, magnitude) location errors, varying magnitude of completeness, and other problems. These non-uniformities may (and do) produce artificial patterns in the space-time-magnitude clusters of seismicity detected by our, as well as other, methods. In the present work we document the effects of catalog errors on inferred cluster properties, and report some striking patterns that emerge as artifacts of those errors. This includes apparent magnitude dependence, fluctuations in the proportion of singles (clusters consisting of individual events), space-dependent distance to the likely parents of events, and other effects. We also discuss additional differences between the ETAS model and observed seismicity. Finally, we propose a generalization of our method that involves assigning multiple possible parents to each event, and discuss some graph-theoretic techniques that may provide results that are more robust to location errors and other catalog deficiencies.",

Humic acids isolated from leonardite, two peats and a mineral soil were used as organic matter samples because they provide a broad range of variability in terms of the origin and nature of their organic components. Using a solvent-based fractionation method, humic acid samples were disassembled into a humic-like component and a humic-lipid composite. The humic-lipid composite was further disassembled into an amphiphilic and a lipid component using an alkaline aqueous solution. Mixtures that reproduced the composition of self-assembled samples were prepared by mixing the solid individual fractions in the exact proportions that they were present in the original material. The original humic acids or their corresponding mixtures were added as the sole carbon source in separate aerobic cultures containing a microbial consortium isolated from a mineral soil. After incubation for 125 days mineralization of the self-assembled samples was shown to be higher by as much as 70% compared to their corresponding physical mixtures. The extent of mineralization of the self-assembled samples was not correlated to the material’s chemical composition or hydrophobicity index obtained from their 13C solid-state NMR spectra. In contrast, mineralization of the physical mixtures and the individual fractions did vary with chemical composition and was accompanied by preferential mineralization of alkyl carbon. These results suggest the microbial mineralization of humic acids is related to their self-assembly.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. coastal communities today face a higher risk of experiencing economic and social disasters than before due to their exposure to an increasing number of coastal hazards and also, because they have experienced a dramatic increase in population and property values over time. Given the continuous increase of coastal population, identifying at-risk communities will help mitigate coastal hazard impacts and prepare for future coastal hazard events. This study fulfills this goal by determining the effectiveness of two global data sets Landscan (gridded population data) and NOAA’s Night Time Imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the U.S. census data at the census block level that are used for demographic analysis and monitoring population dynamics in the U.S. For this study, the global data sets for the years 2011 and 2012, the census data for 2010 were used in conjunction with parcel boundary data (finest resolution data that can be used as a proxy for population data) available annually for Florida.\nThrough comparative analysis, the following research questions were explored: (1) which data set can accurately determine population density and its spatial distribution? (2) how much error is associated with each data set and what is the spatial distribution of error? The study is conducted for the coastal counties of Florida. A preliminary analysis using parcel level data as reference data set revealed that almost 25% of population was lost by both Landscan and VIIRS data sets in comparison to parcel data. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the spatial distribution of error, to identify the correlation between data sets, and identify the data set that is less erroneous in estimating population and its spatial distribution.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are estimated to deliver 27 Mmol a-1 of mercury (Hg) to ocean margins, which is comparable to the global atmospheric deposition flux of Hg to the ocean. Previous studies presumed that most of this riverine Hg is sequestered by settling to the coastal regions. However, there has been little investigation of the mechanism and efficiency with which this sequestration takes place, and the implications for riverine influence in different ocean regions. Here we develop a global 3-D chemical transport model for Hg in the ocean (MITgcm-Hg) with ecology (DARWIN model). We track offshore export of the discharged Hg from heterogeneous river systems over different ocean regions, and how it is influenced by the interaction of Hg in a variety of geochemical forms with carbon and suspended particles. We constrain our model assumptions with available offshore observations that bear strong riverine signals. Modeling results suggest that some of the riverine Hg is highly refractory, sorbs strongly to particles and does not follow equilibrium partitioning with the dissolved phase. Simulated global Hg evasion from riverine sources is 50 times larger without this refractory particulate pool, which results in a total evasion flux two times larger than our current best estimate. Based on a typology system of global rivers, we calculate that 10% to 60% of the particulate Hg from different rivers settles in ocean margin sediments because of subgrid sedimentation processes. The remaining 7.5 Mmol a-1 (28% of total river discharge) is available for offshore transport, where it undergoes further sedimentation to the shelf (5.3 Mmol a-1) as well as evasion to the atmosphere (0.44 Mmol a-1). Only 1.7 Mmol a-1 (6.4% of the global riverine Hg) reaches the open ocean, although that fraction varies from 2.6% in East Asia because of the blockage of Korean Peninsula to 25% in east North America facilitated by the Gulf Stream. We find large riverine influences over coastal oceans off East Asia, and the contributions elsewhere are much smaller due to less riverine Hg discharge. We find the transport of riverine Hg is most influenced by its release rates from organic carbon pools and particle sinking velocities. Varying these parameters changes the contribution of riverine sources to the Hg concentrations over the open ocean for a factor of 2.",

            "abstract": "Geomicrobial rates, rates of microbial metabolism in natural environments, are a key parameter of theoretical and practical problems in geobiology and biogeochemistry. Both laboratory- and field-based approaches have been applied to study rates of geomicrobial processes. Laboratory-based approaches analyze geomicrobial kinetics by incubating environmental samples under controlled laboratory conditions. Field methods quantify geomicrobial rates by observing the progress of geomicrobial processes. To take advantage of recent development in biogeochemical modeling and genome-scale metabolic modeling, we suggest that geomicrobial rates can also be predicted by simulating metabolic reaction networks of microbes.\nTo predict geomicrobial rates, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model that describes enzyme reaction networks of microbial metabolism, and simulated the network model by accounting for the kinetics and thermodynamics of enzyme reactions. The model is simulated numerically to solve cellular enzyme abundance and hence metabolic rates under the constraints of cellular physiology. The new modeling approach differs from flux balance analysis of system biology in that it accounts for the thermodynamics and kinetics of enzymatic reactions. It builds on subcellular metabolic reaction networks, and hence also differs from classical biogeochemical reaction modeling.\nWe applied the new approach to Methanosarcina acetivorans, an anaerobic, marine methanogen capable of disproportionating acetate to carbon dioxide and methane. The input of the new model includes (1) enzyme reaction network of acetoclastic methanogenesis, and (2) representative geochemical conditions of freshwater sedimentary environments. The output of the simulation includes the proteomics, metabolomics, and energy and matter fluxes of M. acetivorans. Our simulation results demonstrate the predictive power of the new modeling approach. Specifically, the results illustrate how methanogenesis rates vary with acetate concentrations and the energy available in the environment, and how M. acetivorans regulate the enzymes of methanogenesis under different biogeochemical conditions.",

            "abstract": "The 1960 M9.5 Valdivia and 1964 M9.2 Alaska megathrust earthquakes caused a zone of secondary coseismic uplift a few hundred kilometers landward of the trench. The secondary uplift exceeds 1m in Valdivia and 0.3m in Alaska. Its universal occurrence during other earthquakes as well as the physical mechanisms governing this process remain unclear, although several mechanisms have been proposed in the last century.\nWe combined survey data from these megathrust earthquakes in the last century with recent high-quality GPS data recorded during the 2010 M8.8 Maule and 2011 M9.0 Tohoku-Oki megathrust earthquakes (Figure 1). Based on these natural observations, we confirm the existence of a zone of secondary uplift in all earthquakes studied and discuss the similarities and differences between them. Dip and curvature of the slab and overriding plate structure seem to influence the amplitude of this phenomenon as well as the location of the transition from subsidence to secondary uplift. This transition ranges from 200 km distance to the trench up to 500 km. The amplitude of the secondary zone of uplift scales with the size of the earthquakes.\nUsing numerical seismo-thermo-mechanical modeling, we identified the low-viscosity lower crust as a crucial factor. A weak viscous lower crust does not accumulate significant stresses and allows for the bending and elastic buckling of a thin and strong elastic upper crust. The amplitude and relative position of the secondary zone of uplift also depends on the interplate decoupling depth as well as the shear modulus and thickness of the upper crust.\nIn conclusion, a secondary zone of coseismic uplift due to megathrust earthquakes exists and it is mainly controlled by the difference between a rheologically strong elastic upper and weak ductile lower crust. Since a weaker lower crust is observed to affect surface displacements distinctly, ignoring this feature will have a profound impact on the estimated slip on the interface. Therefore we suggest including this unequivocal feature in geodetic-based source inversions, especially for settings with a warm, continental overriding plate.",

            "abstract": "Darkened glacier and ice sheet surfaces have lower albedos, absorb more solar radiation and consequently melt more rapidly. The increase in glacier surface darkening is an important positive feedback to warming global temperatures, leading to ever growing world-wide ice mass loss. Most studies focus primarily on glacial albedo darkening caused by the physical properties of snow and ice surfaces, and the deposition of dark impurities on glaciers. To date, however, the important effects of biological activity have not been included in most albedo reduction models. This study provides the first experimental evidence that microbial activity can significantly decrease the albedo of glacier surfaces. An original laboratory experiment, the cryoconite casserole, was designed to test the microbial darkening of glacier surface debris (cryoconite) under simulated Greenlandic summer conditions. It was found that minor fertilisation of the cryoconite (at nutrient concentrations typical of glacial ice melt) stimulated extensive microbial activity. Microbes intensified their organic carbon fixation and even mined phosphorous out of the glacier surface sediment. Furthermore, the microbial organic carbon production, accumulation and transformation caused the glacial debris to darken further by 17.3% reflectivity (albedo analogue). These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced fertilisation by anthropogenic inputs results in substantial amounts of organic carbon fixation, debris darkening and ultimately to a considerable decrease in the ice albedo of glacier surfaces on global scales. The sizeable amounts of microbially produced glacier surface organic matter and nutrients can thus be a vital source of bioavailable nutrients for subglacial and downstream environments.",

Our study focuses on the East and West Coast of the US during the 2012 TCAP (Two Column Aerosol Project) summer and the 2013 SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) campaigns. We define two main receptor regions: (1) ocean-column offshore of Cape-Cod during TCAP and (2) downwind area from Yosemite Rim fires over Nevada and Idaho during SEAC4RS. For each region, we perform forward trajectory simulations from two major emission sources - fires and urban/industrial centers - using FLEXPART Lagrangian analysis driven by WRF meteorology to assign their relative importance. We then compare WRF-Chem simulated column AOD, extinction profiles and ozone amounts for each receptor area with the airborne measurements made by the 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research), as well as with space-borne measurement by MODIS and OMI. Finally, we investigate differences in total AOD, vertical distributions (when available), and ozone levels as they relate to source attribution, spatial averaging, and to modeling and measurement uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "The lunar regolith is derived from impact ejecta, and so understanding ejecta characteristics is a key element of regolith studies. Here we report on the physical properties of impact ejecta from Earth-based and orbital radar (Arecibo / Green Bank telescopes at 12.6- and 70-cm wavelengths, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mini-RF) and LRO Diviner thermal infrared observations. Diviner thermal IR data provide estimates of surface rock abundance, and the radar datasets reveal rocks buried beneath up to several meters of regolith. These four datasets represent a spectrum of observational wavelengths, and their intercomparison provides a means of constraining both ejecta block content and depth extent. We examine all craters on the lunar nearside that show evidence for blocky ejecta, whether buried or on the surface, in order to investigate spatial, crater size-, and time-dependent variations in ejecta block size distribution and spatial extent. Previous work has shown that it is possible to quantify the relationship between surface ejecta rock content and crater age for craters younger than ~1 Gyr; we will now present the results of our effort to extend the age range over which this relationship can be applied by investigating buried ejecta as well. Further, we report on the thermophysical characteristics of distal fine-grained ejecta that have previously been shown to exhibit unique radar characteristics (low radar return and circular polarization ratio). Our results constrain the physical properties of ejecta, and variations in those properties with time and depth, to an extent not possible from examination of visible-wavelength images and multispectral data alone.",

            "abstract": "The wintertime weather in the northern North Atlantic sector is characterized by a succession of intense storms and blocking distortions of the jet stream which cause strong surface fluxes and wind-driven forces. This is also a region of strong oceanic advection of heat northward from the Atlantic into the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean. In this study we examine year to year variations in these surface exchanges and advective contributions through analysis of 14 CMIP5 coupled climate models. All models exhibit decadal ocean variability of Nordic Seas that is comparable in amplitude and timescale to observations. However, the roles of heat advection and surface fluxes in producing this variability are different: some models are heat flux controlled models, while others are advection controlled. We find that the frequency of wintertime blocking events over Greenland is closely linked to these differences. Models with low event frequencies have ocean variability which is mainly flux-driven, while models with high event frequencies, have oceans in which ocean advection is key. Low frequency of these blocking events is also associated with a northeastward shift of the northern surface air pressure center of the model’s representation of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and this connection is discussed. Finally, we discuss connections of ocean variability to sea ice variability in the Arctic Basin and to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.",

            "abstract": "The seismic velocity structure of the lower mantle is dominated by two large, nearly antipodal low shear velocity structures, known as the African and Pacific LLSVPs (Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces). Recent work on the interpretation of tomographic images of the lowermost mantle has identified a smaller region of low shear velocities beneath Eurasia, dubbed the Perm Anomaly. The nature, origin, and dynamics of these low shear velocity anomalies remain obscure; an important outstanding question is how these structures interact with mantle flow. Observations of seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle can help to shed light on mantle dynamics in the vicinity of low shear velocity anomalies, and recent work by several groups has produced evidence for strong anisotropy in D\" along the boundaries of the African LLSVP. Here we interrogate the anisotropic structure of the lowermost mantle in the vicinity of the Perm Anomaly using SKS-SKKS splitting discrepancies measured at 18 long-running broadband stations in Europe. We selected stations for which the upper mantle anisotropy signal beneath the receiver has been well characterized and is simple enough to remove, isolating any contribution to splitting from the lowermost mantle. SK(K)S phases from earthquakes in the southwest Pacific subduction zones sample the lowermost mantle surrounding the Perm Anomaly, while phases from earthquakes in South America and Scotia sample the northernmost portion of the African LLSVP, allowing for a straightforward comparison between the two structures. Preliminary results indicate lowermost mantle anisotropy in both regions, with clear evidence for well-constrained discrepancies in SKS-SKKS splitting for the same event-station pairs measured at several different stations. Comparisons between observations of lowermost mantle anisotropy and the geometry of low shear velocity anomalies deduced from tomographic models shed light on the spatial relationship between the anomalies' edges and strong anisotropy, and on the dynamics of the mantle in and around these anomalous regions.",

            "abstract": "The particles from aeolian or fluvial origin are a useful proxy for the reconstruction of atmospheric condition patterns in the past. Changes in continental aridity and the atmospheric condition determine the composition and amount of lithogenic material and the way of transport from the continent. Here we present a record of laminated sediments (core B040506) retrieved in the continental shelf off Peru. Wind long-term suspension (regional) and local aeolian transport during the last millennium (transition from Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to Little Ice Age (LIA) and the current warm period (CWP)) at centennial to decadal resolution are characterized. The particle provenance and grain size components are discussed using a mathematical model of fractionation. This model assumes that lithological composition of the sediment is an assemblage of several log-normally distributed particle populations. In this way, an interactive least square fitting routine is used to fit the particle grain size collected with the mathematical expression. This allows inferring the spatial and temporal variation of particle populations and thus the transport mechanisms involved. Our results showed a decrease in aeolian transport from the MCA - LIA transition and during the LIA with except of the local aeolian transport that shows peaks during the LIA. This decrease during LIA is accompanied by an enhanced fluvial transport. During the CWP the aeolian transport (Paracas dust storm and wind long-term suspension) display a high variability and tendency to increase in detriment of runoff. Comparison with other South American records indicates that those changes are linked to change in the shift of the ITCZ and Pacific high at the centennial time resolution. Finally the great increase of the fluvial transport within the transition of the LIA to the CWP is synchronous to severe drought period recorded in the Indo-Pacific region indicating higher frequency of El Niño events. Hence these factors indicate an unambiguous change in the atmospheric regime in relationship with climate changes in the last millennium over the Peruvian continental shelf.",

This region is expected to experience significant climatic change, and associated impacts, in the coming decades. To better understand the spatiotemporal variability of vegetation in the Southwest and the expected climatic controls on timing and spatial extend of vegetation growth, we compared GIMMS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, 1981-2011) against temperature and precipitation data. Spatial variations in vegetation seasonality and the timing of peak NDVI are linked to spatial variability in the precipitation regimes across the Southwest. Regions with spring NDVI peaks are dominated by winter precipitation, while late summer and fall peaks are in regions with significant summer precipitation driven by the North American Monsoon. Inter-annual variability in peak NDVI is positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature, with the largest correlation coefficients at one-month lags. The only significant long-term trends in NDVI are for northern Mexico, where agricultural productivity has been increasing over the last 30 years.",

            "abstract": "Despite the growing availability of high-resolution datasets of spatially downscaled CMIP5 projections, few studies have explored the differences in extreme precipitation events that stem from the choice of downscaling method, or from the specific climatological datasets that are used for the bias correction and spatial disaggregation. Here we take three different statistically downscaled methods applied to CMIP5 global climate models and analyze their extreme precipitation events, hindcasted and projected, for the location of NASA Ames Research Center, in South San Francisco Bay. The downscaling methods analyzed are: i) Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), ii) Bias Correction Constructed Analogs (BCCA), and iii) Extreme-value model based on synoptic climate predictors. We fit a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) to datasets i and ii and use statistical tests to determine the significance of differences in the fitted GEV parameters. We explore the implications of the GEV parameter differences by comparing the daily precipitation values corresponding to 100-year, 500-year and 1,000-year return periods in the three datasets. The implications of how extreme daily values are assumed to change with spatial scale, from the gage location (a point location), to a small grid cell (1 km) or a larger grid cell (12 km), are explored.\nFrom our preliminary results, BCCA and BCSD projections predict that extreme precipitation events will be on the rise, and may have the potential to cause flooding at NASA Ames, and in the surrounding Bay Area. These downscaling methods can be studied in further detail in different regions of the contiguous US, and be used by local water resource management agencies in planning infrastructural adaptations.",

            "abstract": "Dust emission schemes in climate models are relatively simple and are tuned to represent observed background aerosol concentrations. Representations of dust emission in the models were developed from idealized experiments such as those conducted in wind tunnels. Improvement of current model dust emission schemes is hampered by a paucity of observations from key dust sources. The Dust Observations for Models project (DO4Models) was aiming on gathering data from source regions at a scale appropriate to climate model grid box resolution.\nHere we present (1) the results of 1D box model simulations using three commonly used parameterizations for the horizontal and vertical dust emission ﬂux, (2) using a newly proposed stochastic dust emission scheme for turbulent wind conditions, and (3) HadGEM3 regional climate model simulations using the current model setup for dust emissions. We are comparing box and RCM model results with DO4Models ﬁeld campaign data retrieved over a typical dust source in Botswana during two consecutive dry seasons (2011 and 2012).\nThe box model performance is further tested using observed soil moisture content, aerodynamic surface stress, shear velocity, and soil size properties. The results suggest that current dust emission schemes do not capture the observed emission ﬂux well. The saltation ﬂux is hugely overestimated, whereas the vertical ﬂux is moderately overestimated. The choice of the sand transport, soil moisture and roughness correction scheme is important but insufﬁcient to bring modeled ﬂuxes into agreement with observed dust ﬂuxes. The stochastic scheme does not suffer from this flux disparity, but cannot be used in cases of strong surface saltation. Potential reasons for the diagnosed mismatch are discussed and the impact of spatial averaging over the 11 ﬁeld sites within the 12x12km grid is evaluated.\nHadGEM3 is tested with regard to its capability to reproduce the observed meteorological conditions. Very good agreement with regard to the magnitude of the diurnal cycle in 10m wind speed, wind gusts and surface shear stress is found. overall, the performance of the model regarding the dynamics is sufﬁcient to focus on the shortcomings of the deployed dust emission scheme which is found to be the largest source of uncertainty in terms of dust emission ﬂux.",

            "abstract": "One of the challenges involved in learning earth science is the visualization of processes which occur over large spatial and temporal scales. Shaping Watersheds is an interactive 3D exhibit developed with support from the National Science Foundation by a team of scientists, science educators, exhibit designers, and evaluation professionals, in an effort to improve public understanding and stewardship of freshwater ecosystems. The hands-on augmented reality sandbox allows users to create topographic models by shaping real “kinetic” sand. The exhibit is augmented in real time by the projection of a color elevation map and contour lines which exactly match the sand topography, using a closed loop of a Microsoft Kinect 3D camera, simulation and visualization software, and a data projector. When an object (such as a hand) is sensed at a particular height above the sand surface, virtual rain appears as a blue visualization on the surface and a flow simulation (based on a depth-integrated version of the Navier-Stokes equations) moves the water across the landscape. The blueprints and software to build the sandbox are freely available online (\nhttp://3dh2o.org/71/\n) under the GNU General Public License, together with a facilitator’s guide and a public forum (with how-to documents and FAQs). Using these resources, many institutions (20 and counting) have built their own exhibits to teach a wide variety of topics (ranging from watershed stewardship, hydrology, geology, topographic map reading, and planetary science) in a variety of venues (such as traveling science exhibits, K-12 schools, university earth science departments, and museums). Additional exhibit extensions and learning modules are planned such as tsunami modeling and prediction. Moreover, a study is underway at the Lawrence Hall of Science to assess how various aspects of the sandbox (such as visualization color scheme and level of interactivity) affect understanding of earth science concepts.",

            "abstract": "Thermodynamic calculations of the fo2 on modeled bulk silicate Earth mantle composition predict the formation of Fe-Ni metal alloy at about 250-300 km in depth. At such conditions the speciation of subducted carbon will be mainly affected by the local Fe(Ni)/C ratio, with diamond, Fe3C and C-bearing Fe-Ni alloys being the most likely stable phases. To date however, no data are available to determine the effect of pressure and temperature on 1) the transport of carbon by diffusion in iron metal and 2) the kinetics of formation of carbide phases.\nWe performed multianvil experiments between 3 and 10 GPa and temperatures of 700-1200 ºC with the aim of measuring C diffusion in γ-Fe. Glassy carbon and synthetic diamond were used as diffusants, placed directly in contact with pure iron rod rods with a thickness of 800-1400 μm. FE-SEM was used for accurate analyses of the Fe-C interface and concentration profiles of carbon in iron were measured by electron microprobe.\nResults show that the diffusion coefficient for carbon in iron metal (~3x10-11 m2s-1) and the activation energy (~62 kJ/mol) are similar to previous data from 1 atm and suggest a small pressure effect. The activation volume (~1.5x10-6 m3/mol) determined from isothermal runs is in agreement with that determined for other elements for which an interstitial diffusion mechanism in iron has been established. At the interface between carbon and Fe the growth of a reaction rim was often observed. Time series experiments were therefore performed, to investigate the growth kinetics of iron carbide (Fe3C). Results will be used to 1) determine a model for the storage of C in metallic phases in the Earth's interior and 2) provide an experimental constraint on the formation of carbide phases during subduction, with implications for the deep carbon cycle and isotopic fractionation.",

            "abstract": "Most faults have not ruptured once historically, let alone repeatedly. Estimating future rupture length of an earthquake source has been a challenge since the 1970s when concepts of full and half fault lengths were employed. In the 1980s paleoseismic event timing and observations of slip, coupled with geometric and other physical fault changes, led to concepts of fault segmentation and it’s modeling for hazard. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3 (UCERF 3, Field et al., 2014) relaxed segmentation, guided by rules in which a separation distance of ≤5km and orientation to Coulomb stress changes at fault junctions are prime factors for allowing fault-to-fault jumps. A set of ~350 fault sections produced ~250K ruptures ranging in length from 15 km-1200 km. An inversion provided the rates of these, which range from 102-108 years. Many of the long ruptures have exceedingly low individual rates within the UCERF 3 geologic model but are sufficient in number to release cumulative moment that brings the long-term (Myr) and historical (since 1850) MFDs for the California region into close agreement.\nDoes UCERF 3 have too many multi-fault ruptures? Since 1850 there have been ~260 surface ruptures worldwide in shallow continental crust. 77% are 0-49km; 6% exceed 150km, and the longest is 1906 San Francisco (435-470 km). In California since 1857 there have been 31 surface ruptures. 77% are shorter than 49 km. The longest are 1906, 1857 Fort Tejon (297km), and 1872 Owens Valley (108 km). Most long historical strike-slip ruptures are continuous and geomorphically well-defined traces with limited geometric changes. In contrast, UCERF3 modeling of the south Hayward, as an example, allows it to participate in ruptures that extend to the south ends of the San Andreas or San Jacinto faults (900 km). These include branching (Hayward-Calaveras, San Andreas-San Jacinto) and jumps (Calaveras-San Andreas) on creeping sections of these faults. 5km is the connectivity threshold in UCERF 3 but only 40% of historical ruptures have negotiated this distance. There are other controls of rupture propagation: frictional properties, rupture dynamics, creep, and, as shown by the 2002 Denali-Totschunda rupture, the timing of the prior event and level of stress accumulation on adjacent fault sections. Time will be the tester.",

            "abstract": "Algal blooms have become a major concern over the last decade in Kuwait’s coastal waters where these blooms caused massive fish kill in a number of incidences. The purpose of this study is to accomplish the following: 1) identify the factors controlling algal bloom the development and propagation using Aqua-MODIS satellite data products (from 07/2002 to 07/2012), (2) identify the spatial and temporal variations in Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) production in relation to the controlling factors; and 3) develop conceptual and predictive models (using in-situ and satellite-based datasets) that account for reported historical blooms and can successfully predict algal bloom proliferation in space and time. To achieve these goals, the following tasks were accomplished: 1) in-situ Chl-a data was correlated with satellite-based (MODIS and MERIS) Chl-a data products (OC3M, GIOP, GSM, and OC4E); 2) Chl-a concentration (from OC3M) were correlated spatially and temporally with potential controlling factors (SST, Turbidity, Euphotic Depth, Precipitation, Photosynthetically Available Radiation, Wind Vectors etc.); 3) the stepwise regression method was applied to identify the most significant controlling factors and to determine their order of importance; and 4) a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to predict the bloom occurrences in time (first layer process) and space (second layer process). Findings include: 1) the Aqua-MODIS OC3M Chlorophyll-a algorithm correlated best with in-situ measurements (RMSE: 2.42, Mean Bias: 32.2%); (2) maximum OC3M Chl-a concentration was observed throughout the months of August through October (Temp. range: 18.4° to 22.3 °C); 3) the stepwise regression identified SST, secchi disk depth, wind direction, OC3M and wind speed as the most indicative temporal factors (SST: most significant R2: 80.1%) and the OC3M, distance to shore, GSM, SST and GIOP as the most indicative spatial variables; 4) the ANN model showed an excellent prediction performance (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve: 0.99), and (5) findings are being utilized for the development of an early warning system in the Kuwait Bay.",

            "abstract": "It is increasingly clear that coccolithophores actively manage their growth and carbon allocation in response to changing environmental conditions. For example, recent work has identified carbon-concentrating mechanisms in coccolithophores—in which the organisms actively enhance the abundance of CO2 in the chloroplast by pumping in bicarbonate—as the source of vital isotope effects in coccolith calcite. Understanding the record for and consequences of this management in the geologic record remains challenging. Here we examine the geometry and geochemistry of coccoliths in surface sediments from the deep ocean to relate these measurements to the modern growth environment in the surface ocean. In this core-top dataset that spans a wide range of environmental and oceanographic settings, we measure the size and thickness of coccolith plates, the trace metal and stable isotopic carbon in coccolith calcite, as well as determine alkenone biomarker fluxes and alkenone carbon isotopic composition (εp). This holistic approach aims to elucidate the carbon acquisition and allocation strategies employed by modern coccolithophores and ultimately provide a better framework for interpreting paleoproductivity. This method may provide insight into the growth rate and carbon allocation of coccoliths in the past, and may improve our understanding of the influence of atmospheric CO2 on coccolithophore communities.",

            "abstract": "In October 2013, graduate student members of the University of Hawaii Geophysical Society designed a small-scale model research vessel (R/V) that uses sonar to create 3D maps of a model seafloor in real-time. This pilot project was presented to the public at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology’s (SOEST) Biennial Open House weekend. An estimated 7,600 people attended the two-day event, including children and teachers from Hawaii’s schools, home school students, community groups, families, and science enthusiasts. Our exhibit demonstrated real-time sonar mapping of a cardboard volcano using a toy size research vessel on a fixed 2D model ship track suspended above a model seafloor. Sound wave travel times were recorded using an unltrasonic emitter/receiver attached to an Arduino microcontroller platform, while the same system measured displacement along the ship track. This data was streamed through a USB connection to a PC running MatLab, where a 3D model was updated as the ship collected data. Our exhibit demonstrates the practical use of complicated concepts, like wave physics and data processing, in a way that even the youngest elementary students are able to understand. It provides an accessible avenue to learn about sonar mapping, and could easily be adapted to talk about bat and marine mammal echolocation by replacing the model ship and volcano. The exhibit received an overwhelmingly positive response from attendees, and has inspired the group to develop a more interactive model for future exhibitions, using multiple objects to be mapped that participants could arrange, and a more robust ship movement system that participants could operate.",

            "abstract": "We present the first high-resolution multiproxy reconstruction of the past 18,000 years of oceanic redox variability in the southeastern Gulf of California (GC) and eastern Pacific. The variation in oxygen content prove to be a crucial regulator responsible for changes in biota distribution, water chemistry, physicochemical transformations of dissolved and particulate phases for trace elements in the water column, and formation of authigenic minerals, among other effects. The gravity core DIPAL-III T2 collected aboard the R/V “El Puma” (UNAM) from Pescadero Basin, located within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the southern GC, was thoroughly studied in terms of C, S, trace element and Fe speciation. After establishing the age-model of the marine sediments, the produced data revealed two clear episodes of peleoceanographic variability, associated with changes in hypoxia. The first period (18.0 - 11.6 cal kyr BP), represented by massive sediments, points to a time with an oxygenated water column and moderate productivity, elucidated by low Corg, high S and a relatively low redox sensitive trace element content (Mo and U). The second (11.6 cal kyr BP - present), easily perceived by a clear lamination pattern, indicates a suboxic/anoxic episode, evidenced by higher Corg, Mo and U, among others. A clear dramatic shift is distinctly observable between these periods for most of the redox-proxies. This shift is related to the changes in sea-level that immediately followed the Last Glacial Maximum, when the ice sheets began to melt. This transitioned Pescadero hydrochemistry from a shallow well-ventilated basin (prior to 11.6 cal kyr BP) to a deep OMZ system. When compared to renowned marine sedimentary records, such as Cariaco and Guaymas basins, some events became more eminent than others. In the particular case of the Younger Dryas (YD) stadial and Bolling Allerod (BA) interstadial, the Corg, S and some trace element patterns were similar among basins even from different climatic and oceanographic settings. The latter provides evidence that the mentioned paleoceanographic events had a wider influence than previously reported.",

Spectral bands designed for daytime imaging are particularly useful for detecting and characterizing fires, flares and industrial heat sources. By measuring combustion source emitted radiances across a range of wavelengths, the nightfire algorithm is able to model the Planck curve, which makes it possible to estimate temperature, size, and radiant heat of subpixel combustion sources. The algorithm fits two Planck curves for the sub-pixel fire and the background in a detected pixel and estimates the fire temperature, area and radiative power. Combining one day of data from the Suomi NPP VIIRS sensor, the Nightfire algorithm can detect and characterize more than 10,000 fires on the night side of the Earth with temperatures ranging from 500 K to 2,500 K and active burn areas down to several square meters. The temperature histogram for the detected fires has two distinct peaks discriminating gas flares from biomass burning. The Nightfire algorithm has been successfully applied to nighttime scenes from the Landsat 8 OLI sensor which has 30 m spatial resolution and higher dynamic range than VIIRS.

            "abstract": "Hydraulic interactions between rivers and floodplains produce off-channel chutes, whose presence can increase the ecological diversity of the valley floor. Detailed studies of the hydrologic exchanges between channels and floodplains are usually conducted in laboratory facilities, and studies documenting chute development are generally limited to qualitative observations. In this study, we use a reconstructed, gravel-bedded, meandering river as a laboratory for studying these mechanisms at field scale. Using an integrated field and modeling approach, we quantified the flow exchanges between the river channel and its floodplain during an overbank flood, and identified locations where flow had the capacity to erode floodplain chutes. Hydraulic measurements and modeling indicated high rates of flow exchange between the channel and floodplain, with flow rapidly decelerating as water was decanted from the channel onto the floodplain due to the frictional drag provided by substrate and riparian vegetation. Peak shear stresses were greatest downstream of the maxima in bend curvature, along the concave bank, where terrestrial LiDAR scans indicate initial floodplain chute formation. A second chute has developed across the convex bank of a meander bend, in a location where sediment accretion, point bar development and plant colonization have created divergent flow paths between the main channel and floodplain. In both cases, the off-channel chutes are evolving slowly during infrequent floods due to the coarse nature of the floodplain, though rapid chute formation would be more likely in finer-grained floodplains. The controls on chute formation at these locations include the river curvature, cross-stream position of the high velocity core, erodibility of the floodplain sediment, and the density of riparian vegetation.",

            "abstract": "The Cascadia subduction zone of the Pacific Northwest terminates in the south at the Mendocino Triple Junction, a region of elevated seismic activity. Here, tectonically driven uplift is likely responsible for the formation of Holocene-aged marine terraces. In 1992, a M 7.1 thrust mainshock and two ~M 6.5 aftershocks occurred offshore of Cape Mendocino, resulting in 1.4 meters of uplift, measured from stranded intertidal species on uplifted wave-cut platforms. However, it is unknown whether these marine terraces formed due solely to large episodic coseismic uplift caused by moderately large to large magnitude earthquakes, orwhether interseismic deformation plays a role in their formation. Moreover, detailed mapping of these terraces has not been done since Merits (1996). For this study, we map a suite of four terraces and bedrock wave cut platforms between Cape Mendocino and Punta Gorda on the northern California coast near the town of Petrolia. By mapping both exposed and buried Holocene marine terraces we aim to discern the pattern of deformation causing their uplift, and determine whether uplift is related solely to episodic coseismic events, or both coseismic and interseismic deformation. Detailed mapping of the extent and elevation of both exposed and buried terraces is achieved by using real time kinematic (RTK) GPS surveying on base maps compiled using the 2009-2011 California Coastal Conservancy LIDAR. Preliminary results indicate formation predominantly from coseismic uplift in moderate magnitude subduction earthquakes. This work offers insight into understanding the upper plate crustal response to seismic events and interseismic periods in tectonically complex areas like the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Planktonic foraminifera are widely used proxy carriers in paleoceanography. The flux of foraminiferal shells to the sea floor is not even throughout the year, creating a seasonal bias in the surface conditions recorded in an average fossil sample. This bias, and its changes through time, may account for an important part of the variability in paleoclimate records, but it is often ignored because of limited knowledge on the determinants of flux seasonality. To address this issue we have compiled a global dataset on shell flux seasonality from sediment traps. The database contains 38 globally distributed time series of at least one year and covers >20 species. We use periodic regression to objectively determine peak flux timing and amplitude. Significant seasonality is observed in 80 % of the cases studied and we distinguish three distinct groups of foraminifera with different modes of seasonality. This division is independent of ocean basin or upwelling and appears to reflect three principle patterns of phenology.\nWarm-water and symbiont-bearing species change flux seasonality by concentrating a larger proportion of the annual flux in a shorter period in colder water. Peak flux timing appears random at high temperatures and shifts towards autumn at lower temperatures. Seasonal flux variability is small at high temperatures (within their optimal range) resulting in a negligible seasonal bias. In colder waters the timing appear constant and the strength of the peak flux can be predicted by temperature. Temperate and cold-water dwellers adjust their peak timing with average temperature. Peak flux in these species occurs later during the year at lower temperatures and follows chlorophyll maxima by approximately a month. The strength of peak flux is similar across the temperature range, but the association with productivity allows for prediction of the timing of peak flux. Peak flux of deep-dwelling seems to occur in spring independent of temperature, which may agree with a longer reproductive cycle, and show a tendency for increased peak prominence at higher temperatures. These observations shed new light on the factors explaining seasonal variability in the shell flux of planktonic foraminifera and will aid to improve paleoceanographic reconstructions by allowing prediction of temporal changes in seasonality.",

            "abstract": "We present microstructural, LPO, and misorientation data from EBSD analyses to interpret the deformation mechanisms of naturally deformed plagioclase in an amphibolite-facies extensional shear zone within oceanic crust. Textural data and mineral chemistry data for thermometry were acquired on samples of gabbro mylonite collected from the footwall of the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex; we focus on a monophase plagioclase layer with a high ratio of recrystallized matrix grains to porphyroclasts.\nSample microstructures are subdivided into three regions: seven porphyroclasts, recrystallized grains immediately adjacent to those porphyroclasts, and the population of recrystallized matrix grains. All porphyroclasts exhibit subgrain development and show clustering of low-angle (3-10º) misorientation axes within the {010} plane, consistent with slip on {010}. However, only one porphyroclast is oriented for operation of the {010}<001> easy slip system. The small recrystallized grains immediately adjacent to the porphyroclasts do not show a host control relationship with their respective porphyroclasts, and these grains are also smaller than the subgrains of the porphyroclasts. Recrystallized matrix grains are fine-grained (mean grain size ~ 8 μm) and slightly elongate parallel to foliation, with local misorientations concentrated along grain boundaries and junctions. They exhibit a weak, nonrandom LPO suggesting the activity of the {111}<110> slip system, and their neighbor-pair misorientations are shifted towards higher angles.\nWe interpret the distinctive relationships between the three regions as evidence of a transition from dislocation creep to dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (DisGBS). Porphyroclast subgrains and misorientation axes suggest the operation of dislocation creep, but the lack of host control in the adjacent recrystallized grains precludes grain size reduction through subgrain rotation recrystallization alone. High driving force bulge nucleation likely contributed to the grain size reduction and recrystallization of matrix grains, triggering the onset of grain size sensitive DisGBS. We suggest that the transition between deformation mechanisms is an effective weakening mechanism that contributed to development of the shear zone.",

            "abstract": "The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is the depth below which negligible calcium carbonate is preserved in marine sediments. The long-term position of the CCD is often considered to be a powerful constraint on palaeoclimate and atmospheric CO2 concentration due to the requirement that carbonate burial balance riverine weathering over long timescales. The requirement that weathering and burial be in balance is clear, but it is less certain that burial compensates for changes in weathering via shoaling or deepening of the CCD. Because most carbonate burial occurs well above the CCD , changes in weathering fluxes may be primarily accommodated by increasing or decreasing carbonate burial at shallower depths, i.e., at or near the lysocline, the depth range over which carbonate dissolution markedly increases. Indeed, recent earth system modelling studies have suggested that the position of the CCD is relatively insensitive to changes in atmospheric pCO2. Additionally, studies have questioned the nature and strength of the relationship between the CCD, carbonate saturation state in the water column, and lysocline. To test the relationship between palaeoclimate and the location of the CCD, we reconstructed the global, long-term CCD behaviour across major Cenozoic climate transitions: the late Paleocene - early Eocene long-term warming trend (study interval ~58 to 49 Ma) and the late Eocene - early Oligocene cooling and glaciation (study interval ~38 to 27 Ma). We use Earth system modelling (GENIE) to explore the links between atmospheric pCO2 and the CCD, isolating and teasing apart the roles of total dissolved inorganic carbon, temperature, circulation, and productivity in determining the CCD.",

When Bw > 1, deposition and erosion derived from changes in flow depth that produce accelerations akin to a kinematic wave. When Bw < 1, shear stress is determined by changes in slope, which produces diffusional evolution. We conduct a survey of Bw for 41 alluvial bedform studies ranging in scale from dunes to river deltas, from both field and experimental studies. For field-scale measurements, we find that dunes have Bw > 140, braid bars range between 13 and 37, meanders wavelengths range between 13 and 18, river mouth processes range between 8 and 30, and delta avulsions cluster around 1, as predicted by theory. Importantly, Bw >> 1 for field-scale alluvial bedforms appears to be a rule. Further, bedforms that are traditionally simple to recreate in physical experiments have strong overlap between lab and field scales, while experimental meanders and river mouth processes, which have been difficult to recreate in the lab, have much smaller Bw in the lab than in the field. We present the theory of backwater scaling as a method for estimating sedimentary dimensions, and propose a potential solution to the difficulties of Bw scaling in the laboratory.",

            "abstract": "Ease of access to satellite sensor imagery and image products has driven the use of remote sensing data in many disciplines including landscape ecology, forestry, environmental and wildlife management, agriculture and epidemiology. A common format of these data is as vegetation indices and of these; the most widely used is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). There are many examples where the NDVI has been assessed as a covariate in spatial models of ecosystem health, faunal habitat, faunal distribution and condition, forage quality and disease risk, to name but a few. Occasionally, such applications detach the NDVI from its theoretical underpinnings; there may be no consideration of surface phenomena affecting the radiation environment and causing change in red and near infrared (NIR) reflectance. In this paper, we revisit classic remote sensing research to determine for which environmental modeling applications the NDVI is likely to be meaningful. We collated data from multiple published research studies to characterize the relationships between NDVI and vegetation canopy variables (leaf area index, biomass, percentage cover and the fraction of absorbed radiation) over different vegetation types. Using these collated data sets, we discuss the physical basis of the relationships between NDVI and vegetation canopy variables, how and why these relationships differ and what this means for the usefulness of the NDVI as a proxy for Earth surface or climate variables. We conclude with a critique of the variables that NDVI has been used to replace as a proxy and show its success or failure as a proxy variable relates back to the simple relationships known to exist between NDVI and vegetation canopy variables.",

            "abstract": "Rivers of high mountain Asia are of tremendous importance for livelihoods and well-being of hundreds of millions of people [1]. Independent of climate change the population of the Indus basin will experience water scarcity due to demographic pressures [2]. Recent geophysical research focusing on the Karakoram has revealed patterns of change in both climate [3,4] and cryosphere [5,6] which diverge from the trajectories expected in a globally warming climate. Additional studies have underlined the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on glacier mass balance status [7,8].\nThis study identifies and quantifies a regional feature of atmospheric circulation, the latitudinal position of the westerly jet “immediately upstream” of the Karakoram, which has substantial influence of surface air temperature variability across the Himalayan Mountain Arc and adjacent Indo-Gangetic plains. Characteristics of this feature, and its correlation to local air temperatures, are compared amongst an ensemble of meteorological reanalyses: ERA-40, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, NASA MERRA and JRA-55.\nCorrelations between the westerly jet position and local observations indicate a strong causal mechanism of short term near surface air temperature variability. Furthermore, the Karakoram and NW UIB respond differently during the Summer season to this circulation mode than both the plains of the lower Indus as well as the Central and Eastern Himalaya. This differentiated response provides a plausible explanation for differences in summer temperature trends along the Himalayan arc and by substantiating differences in melt season energy inputs provides a clear climatic mechanism to explain the “Karakoram anomaly.”\n[1] DOI:10.1126/science.330.6004.585-a\n[2] DOI:10.5194/hess-14-1669-2010\n[3] DOI:10.1175/JCLI3860.1\n[4] DOI:10.3354/cr00957\n[5] DOI:10.1038/ngeo1450\n[6] DOI:10.1038/nature11324\n[7] DOI:10.1038/nclimate1580\n[8] DOI:10.1038/nclimate2055",

            "abstract": "Significant changes in Arctic sea ice extent have been observed in recent years, particularly at the end of the summer. Climate models that have a reasonable late 20th century Arctic climate, forecast ice-free summers in the Arctic before the end of this century. While these models agree on the decline of sea ice extent and the likelihood of a largely seasonal Arctic sea ice cover, the pattern of the sea ice loss and marginal ice zone locations predicted by different models varies widely. Narrowing the uncertainty implicit in these model disagreements is an important contribution to the accuracy of global climate projections. To this end we track the boundary between first and multi-year ice (i.e. the minimum September sea-ice edge position) using Lagrangian back and forward trajectories in both the instrumental record and GCMs participating in the IPCC-AR5. We use the trajectories to quantify the magnitude and interannual variability in the thermodynamic and dynamic (ice export) ice loss, the amount and geographical distribution of multiyear ice melt and first year promotion to second year ice. Results clearly highlight the importance of pre-conditioning (previous winter ice export) on the following summer minimum ice extent. Assessing whether climate models reproduce the correct dynamics of the MIZ can increase our confidence in climate forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Microbial habitability in extreme environments on Earth is described by microscale geochemical conditions that constrain metabolic niches in concert with long-term habitat stability that is governed by dynamic geologic processes. Using terrestrial analogs to identify habitable martian environments requires correlating microscale geochemical constraints with reconstructions of past martian environments that are based on global-scale observations. While past martian environments can be characterized by primary parameters (e.g. pH, redox, mineralogy, thermal history), microbial habitability on Earth is a complex function of both primary and derived parameters (e.g. metabolic reaction energetics, chemical & thermal gradients, flow dynamics). In recent years we have been investigating acid-sulfate fumaroles at the Mars analog site, Cerro Negro Volcano, Nicaragua, where habitability is constrained by steep thermal gradients, spatially- and temporally-variable vent dynamics, and limited water and nutrient availability. The most common niche identified thus far is found in fumaroles that host mixed photosynthetic and chemosynthetic endolithic microbial communities. One such endolith is dominated by acidic red algae (Cyanidiales), aerobic bacterial heterotrophs (Ktedonobacteria), and archaeal thermoacidophiles (Hyperthermus, Caldisphaera, and Thermofilum). An analysis of the metabolic structure suggests that primary production by the red algae supports the growth of heterotrophic thermoacidophiles. Diversification among the chemoheterotrophs with respect to temperature and oxygen tolerance suggests community adaptation to environmental gradients or variable venting dynamics. Furthermore, individual cells within the endolith are silica-encrusted, providing the possibility for biosignature formation and preservation. Putative hydrothermal environments on early Mars with similar conditions could have supported endolithic communities with comparable metabolic strategies. Even on a generally cold and dry Mars, volcanic craters likely provided long-lived warm and wet conditions that could have supported diverse assemblages of thermoacidophilic organisms with various metabolic strategies adapted to environmental conditions of acid-sulfate fumaroles.",

            "abstract": "Physical and chemical associations with mineral surfaces may protect organic matter (OM) from oxidative degradation and allow its preservation in soils and sediments. This study evaluates the mechanism of mineral-based preservation (MBP) and the time scale on which MBP is operative by tracking the co-evolution of oxide minerals and associated OM during mineral precipitation and ripening. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy coupled to near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) as well as bulk NEXAFS demonstrate that, in laboratory systems using cell-free filtrate from pure bacterial cultures, an association between OM and biogenic manganese oxides is rapidly established. OM associated with freshly precipitated biominerals consists of proteinaceous carbon and nitrogen consistent with a microbial origin; this composition remains constant over the course of 96 hours, despite mineral aggregation and structural evolution from hexagonal to triclinic birnessite. We predict that, in natural systems, oxide minerals simultaneously drive remineralization and offer MBP. Different minerals will promote a different balance between the two, imparting a mineral-specific signature on the concentration and composition of preserved OM. We test this idea by conducting incubations of natural estuary waters spiked with compositionally and structurally diverse synthetic oxide minerals. The concentration and composition of mineral-associated OM were tracked by element analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) and STXM-NEXAFS in multiple experiments lasting between 4 weeks and 1 year. Results from incubation experiments are contrasted with natural sediment samples from a range of depositional environments in order to evaluate the potential for long-term sequestration of organic carbon in sediments facilitated by minerals.",

More importantly, the wide range of experience helped me identify what worked for me. My favorite way to share my science now? Twitter.\nTo many, Twitter is a frivolous platform for sharing snippets 140 characters or less. To me, however, it is how I can connect directly with the elusive “wider public” and share my science.\nSpecifically, I use satellite imagery (mostly Landsat 8) to study glaciers around the world. I look at long-term change related to climate, and I also investigate new, innovative ways to use satellite imagery to better understand glaciers and ice sheets. Luckily for me, my research is very visual. Whether fieldwork snapshots or satellite data, images make for great, shareable, accessible tweets.\nIn this presentation, I propose to share my experience of tweeting as an early career researcher. I will include successful strategies (e.g. particular #hashtags, creating new content, using story-telling, timely tweets), as well as some not-so-successful attempts. I will also talk about how I built my Twitter network. In addition to anecdotes, I will include evaluation of my Twitter activity using available metrics and analytics (e.g. followers, favorites, re-tweets, Klout score, etc.).\nWhile misunderstood by many in the scientific community, Twitter is a platform increasingly being adopted by researchers. Used correctly, it can be a great tool for connecting directly with an interested, non-technical audience eager to learn about your research. With my experiences and evaluation, I will show how both scientists and the networks that they join and create can benefit by using Twitter as a platform for science communication.",

J. Hydrology 2009). Therefore, heat waves occurring at this period of the year can have particularly severe repercussions. Furthermore, current climate projections suggest that their frequency and intensity may increase in the future. Numerous heat-wave studies have focused on the mid-latitudes, but almost none on the Sahel. However, the specificities of the Sahelian climate imply that the mechanisms at play in this semi-arid region differ from those previously identified in the mid-latitudes. The influence of the Saharan Heat low is strong in this region; the soil is mostly dry in Spring, and soil-moisture feedbacks identified in mid-latitude studies are therefore unlikely to operate during Sahelian heat waves at this time of year. The present study is carried out within the ACASIS ANR project, which focuses on these Sahelian events. Here, we make use of complementary datasets (SYNOP and soundings data, high-frequency weather and flux stations, satellite data, meteorological reanalyses), together with models, to explore the importance of physical processes during a few selected heat-wave cases chosen from 2006 to 2014. These events are first identified with commonly-used indexes and the associated large-scale circulations are documented. The time-sequences of the surface energy budget and boundary layer diurnal and nocturnal states are then presented, with estimations of non-negligible cloud and aerosol effects on surface radiative fluxes. Our results imply in particular a major importance of the monsoon flow during the night, which induces dramatic changes in the surface-atmosphere couplings, namely a sharp increase of the net longwave flux involving water vapour radiative properties, accompanied by a strong night-time warming. These processes are diversely captured by models and reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "The NASA/DLR GRACE mission has delivered over a dozen years of time-variable gravitational information that has seen widespread use in the study of processes in hydrology, oceanography, the cryosphere, and is particularly critical to inform, improve, and validate computational models of the Earth system. Assimilation of GRACE products into land surface models has been investigated using the monthly smoothed and destriped gridded-mass (Level-3) datasets. However, the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of these fields limits their use for data assimilation. This study offers advances in (1) improving the signal content retained from the GRACE satellite observations via the use of sliding window solutions and (2) improvements of the error characterization and data assimilation procedure of GRACE TWS information into the Community Land Model (CLM).\nPresently, approximately thirty equally weighted days of data are used to estimate each gravity field. However, through differential weighting of the daily GRACE files used in each solution it is possible to optimize the desired signal characteristics while fulfilling the observability requirements. This differential weighting scheme creates a pseudo-daily “sliding window” product and increases the frequency retention by boosting the low frequency gain and providing gravity field solutions on shorter time scales. The effectiveness of the modified solutions is assessed through assimilation of both the sliding window and traditional monthly solutions into CLM using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The error characterization of the GRACE observations is expanded within the DA framework to show and accurately reflect the spatial and temporal error patterns present in the data. Furthermore, the transformation between model and observation space and the disaggregation of the update calculated by the Ensemble Kalman Filter to the finer resolution CLM state variable space bears further examination. The addition of improved frequency retention, error characterization and model state-observation transformation algorithmics offers increased effectiveness and new methods of data extraction from time-variable gravity datasets from the GRACE and future geodetic observing missions.",

            "abstract": "Cloud-based applications or apps are a promising medium through which water resources models and data can be conveyed in a user-friendly environment—making them more accessible to decision-makers and stakeholders. In the context of this work, a water resources web app is a web application that exposes limited modeling functionality for a scenario exploration activity in a structured workflow (e.g.: land use change runoff analysis, snowmelt runoff prediction, and flood potential analysis).\nThe technical expertise required to develop water resources web apps can be a barrier to many potential developers of water resources apps. One challenge that developers face is in providing spatial storage, analysis, and visualization for the spatial data that is inherent to water resources models. The software projects that provide this functionality are non-standard to web development and there are a large number of free and open source software (FOSS) projects to choose from. In addition, it is often required to synthesize several software projects to provide all of the needed functionality. Another challenge for the developer will be orchestrating the use of several software components. Consequently, the initial software development investment required to deploy an effective water resources cloud-based application can be substantial.\nThe Tethys Platform has been developed to lower the technical barrier and minimize the initial development investment that prohibits many scientists and engineers from making use of the web app medium. Tethys synthesizes several software projects including PostGIS for spatial storage, 52°North WPS for spatial analysis, GeoServer for spatial publishing, Google Earth™, Google Maps™ and OpenLayers for spatial visualization, and Highcharts for plotting tabular data. The software selection came after a literature review of software projects being used to create existing earth sciences web apps. All of the software is linked via a Python-powered software development kit (SDK). Tethys developers use the SDK to build their apps and incorporate the needed functionality from the software suite. The presentation will include several apps that have been developed using Tethys to demonstrate its capabilities.\nBased upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1135483.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea level are measurable on both a local and a global scale providing an accessible way to connect climate to education, yet engaging teachers and students with the complex science that is behind the change in sea level can be a challenge. Deciding how much should be included and just how it should be introduced in any single classroom subject area can be an obstacle for a teacher.\nThe Sea Level Rise Polar Explorer App developed through the PoLAR CCEP grant offers a guided tour through the many layers of science that impact sea level rise. This map-based data-rich app is framed around a series of questions that move the user through map layers with just the level of complexity they chose to explore. For a quick look teachers and students can review a 3 or 4 sentence introduction on how the given map links to sea level and then launch straight into the interactive touchable map. For a little more in depth look they can listen to (or read) a one-minute recorded background on the data displayed in the map prior to launching in. For those who want more in depth understanding they can click to a one page background piece on the topic with links to further visualizations, videos and data. Regardless of the level of complexity selected each map is composed of clickable data allowing the user to fully explore the science. The different options for diving in allow teachers to differentiate the learning for either the subject being taught or the user level of the student group.\nThe map layers also include a range of complexities. Basic questions like “What is sea level?” talk about shorelines, past sea levels and elevations beneath the sea. Questions like “Why does sea level change?” includes slightly more complex issues like the role of ocean temperature, and how that differs from ocean heat content. And what is the role of the warming atmosphere in sea level change? Questions about “What about sea level in the past?” can bring challenges for students who have difficulty with time scales, but sections on “Who is Vulnerable?” are very tangible to the students as they look at maps of population density, ocean island populations in danger of submersion, and what regions are most vulnerable to flooding. Teachers and students alike can explore a wealth of authentic science data in an engaging and accessible way.",

            "abstract": "Substantial spatial heterogeneity of methane flux has been recognized as a key uncertainty for estimating land-atmosphere exchange and further predicting the behavior of the climate system. Static-chamber method has been widely used to measure methane flux at plot-scale of tens of centimeter while it is unable for the scale beyond, and the eddy covariance technique has been used for in-situ measuring methane flux at a scale of tens of meters while it lacks of mechanistic representation of biogeochemical processes at smaller scale. How to link methane flux at these two scales while keeping primary spatial variations is critically important for accurate quantification of methane flux. A data-model integration approach is a valuable tool to scale-up methane flux while sustaining spatial heterogeneity.\nIn this study, we take advantage of a set of in-situ measurements of methane flux at plot-scale and a flux tower domain scale, and a high-resolution dataset of vegetation distribution and meteorology data, as well as a newly-developed microbial functional group-based methane module (incorporated in CLM4.5). A footprint model is used to characterize the domain of the eddy covariance tower in which high-resolution model simulations are carried out. The ecosystem model is first parameterized with plot-scale measurements of methane flux and ecosystem properties before it is used for regional simulations across the flux tower domain. The simulated regional methane flux will be weighted by spatial contribution of land surface methane flux estimated by the footprint model, and then compared with eddy covariance measurement. The low and high boundaries of the methane flux in the domain will be estimated for its potential uncertainties during this upscaling processes by comparing with empirical modeling method. The upscaling approach with data-model integration adopted in this study is valuable as it considers spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem properties and the dynamic representativeness of tower over the season and across the spatial domain.",

Begun as a research project in January 2000, it became quasi-operational in September 2008, and operational at NCEP in August 2014. The NLDAS development included Phase 1 to establish the NLDAS configuration, including collection of soil and vegetation data, selection of land-surface models (LSMs), generation of surface forcing data sets, and model runs for a 3-year period, with evaluation/validation of model output. Phase 2 involved 30-year (1979-2008) retrospective and near real-time runs (2009-present) of four improved LSMs and surface forcing to generate energy and water fluxes, and state variables from those LSMs. The anomalies and percentiles from the 30-year climatologies for evapotranspiration, soil moisture, runoff/streamflow, and snow water equivalent have been comprehensively evaluated against observations, and are used to support US operational drought monitoring and prediction tasks such as the U.S. Drought Monitor, NCEP Climate Prediction Center drought information, and activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System. More than 34 years of surface forcing and model output data have been distributed by the NCEP/EMC NLDAS website (www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/nldas), the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC, daac.gsfc.nasa.gov), the UCAR/NCAR Climate Data Guide (climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data), and the USGS Geo Portal (cida.usgs.gov/gdp). The operational implementation provides more reliable and timely access to NLDAS products. This presentation summarizes experiences of NLDAS, status and format of current NLDAS products, and the future plans for NLDAS.",

            "abstract": "Calibration of physically-based distributed hydrologic models has always been a challenging task and subject of controversy in the literature. This study is aimed to investigate how different physiographic characteristics of watersheds call for adaption of the methods used in order to have more robust and internally justifiable simulations. Haw Watershed (1300 sq. mi.) is located in the piedmont region of North Carolina draining into B. Everett Jordan Lake located in west of Raleigh. Major land covers in this watershed are forest (50%), urban/suburban (21%) and agriculture (25%) of which a large portion is pasture. Different hydrologic behaviors are observed in this watershed based on the land use composition and size of the sub-watersheds. Highly urbanized sub-watersheds show flashier hydrographs and near instantaneous hydrologic responses. This is also the case with smaller sub-watersheds with relatively lower percentage of urban areas. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely used in the literature for hydrologic simulation on daily basis using Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method (SCS CN). However, it has not been used as frequently using the sub-daily routines. In this regard there are a number of studies in the literature which have used coarse time scale (daily) precipitation with methods like SCS CN to calibrate SWAT for watersheds containing different types of land uses and soils reporting satisfying results at the outlet of the watershed. This is while for physically-based distributed models, the more important concern should be to check and analyze the internal processes leading to those results. In this study, the watershed is divided into several sub-watersheds to compare the performance of SCS CN and Green & Ampt (GA) methods on different land uses at different spatial scales. The results suggest better performance of GA compared to SCS CN for smaller and highly urbanized sub-watersheds although GA predominance is not very significant for the latter. Also, the better performance of GA in simulating the peak flows and flashy behavior of the hydrographs is notable. GA did not show a significant improvement over SCS CN in simulating the excess rainfall for larger sub-watersheds.",

The purpose of this study is to produce erosion susceptibility maps for an area that is polluted with mining tailings which are susceptible to erosion and can disperse the particles that contain heavy metals and other toxic elements. USLE method is based in the estimation of soil loss per unit area and takes into account specific parameters such as precipitation data, topography, soil erodibility, erosivity and runoff. The R-factor (rainfall erosivity) was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor (soil erodibility) was estimated using soil maps available from the CONABIO at a scale of 1:250000. The LS-factor (slope length and steepness) was determined from a 30-m digital elevation model. A raster-based Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to interactively calculate soil loss and map erosion hazard. The results show that estimated erosion rates ranged from 0 to 4770.48 t/ha year. Maximum proportion of the total area of the Zacatecas mining district have nil to very extremely slight erosion severity.

            "abstract": "Many quality factors for digital topographic models (DTMs) from stereo imaging can be predicted geometrically. For example, pixel scale is related to instantaneous field of view and to range. DTM resolution can be no better than a few times this pixel scale. Even vertical precision is a known function of the pixel scale and convergence angle, providedthe image quality is high enough that automated image matching reaches its optimal precision (~0.2 pixel). The influence of incidence angle is harder to predict. Reduced quality is expected both at low incidence (where topographic shading disappears) and high incidence (where signal/noise ratio is low and shadows occur). This problem is of general interest, but especially critical for the Europa Clipper mission profile. Clipper would obtain a radar sounding profile on each Europa flyby. Stereo images collected simultaneously would be used to produce a DTM needed to distinguish off-nadir surface echos (clutter) from subsurface features. The question is, how much of this DTM strip will be useful, given that incidence angle will vary substantially?\n We are using simulations to answer this question. We produced a 210 m/post DTM of the Castalia Macula region of Europa from 6 Galileo images by photoclinometry. A low-incidence image was used to correct for albedo variations before photoclinometry. We are using the image simulation software OASIS to generate synthetic stereopairs of the region at a full range of incidence angles. These images will be realistic in terms of image resolution, noise, photometry including albedo variations (based on the low incidence image), and cast shadows. The pairs will then be analyzed with the commercial stereomapping software SOCET SET (® BAE Systems), which we have used for a wide variety of planetary mapping projects. Comparing the stereo-derived DTMs to the input (“truth”) DTM will allow us to quantify the dependence of true DTM resolution and vertical precision on illumination, and to document the qualitative ways that DTMs degrade at high and low incidence angles.\nThis methodology is immediately applicable to other planetary targets, and in particular can be used to address how much difference in illumination can be tolerated in stereopairs that are not (as for Clipper) acquired simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "Physics-based ground motion simulations can calculate the propagation of earthquake waves through 3D velocity models of the Earth. The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) has developed the Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) framework to help researchers build structured or unstructured velocity meshes from 3D velocity models for use in wave propagation simulations.\nThe UCVM software framework makes it easy to extract P and S wave propagation speeds and other material properties from 3D velocity models by providing a common interface through which researchers can query earth models for a given location and depth. Currently, the platform supports multiple California models, including SCEC CVM-S4 and CVM-H 11.9.1, and has been designed to support models from any region on earth. UCVM is currently being use to generate velocity meshes for many SCEC wave propagation codes, including AWP-ODC-SGT and Hercules.\nIn this presentation, we describe improvements to the UCVM software. The current version, UCVM 14.3.0, released in March of 2014, supports the newest Southern California velocity model, CVM-S4.26, which was derived from 26 full-3D tomographic iterations using CVM-S4 as the starting model (Lee et al., this meeting), and the Broadband 1D velocity model used in the CyberShake 14.2 study. We have ported UCVM to multiple Linux distributions and OS X.\nAlso included in this release is the ability to add small-scale stochastic heterogeneities to extract Cartesian meshes for use in high-frequency ground motion simulations. This tool was built using the C language open-source FFT library, FFTW. The stochastic parameters (Hurst exponent, correlation length, and the horizontal/vertical aspect ratio) can be customized by the user.\nUCVM v14.3.0 also provides visualization scripts for constructing cross-sections, horizontal slices, basin depths, and Vs30 maps. The interface allows researchers to visually review velocity models . Also, UCVM v14.3.0 can extract isosurfaces of shear-wave velocities equal to 1 km/s (Z1.0) and 2.5 km/s (Z2.5) for any of the registered velocity models. We have also improved our open source distribution by including a user’s guide, an advanced user’s guide, and a developer’s guide so that users of all levels can get started using and extending the UCVM platform.",

            "abstract": "Through collaborations between scientists and educators, the Consortium for Ocean Leadership developed a series of marine geosciences classroom activities and lesson plans -- including the Adopt-a-Microbe project, a collection of hands-on science lessons that use the sub-seafloor microbiology topics to provide engaging pathways for K-12 students to learn about the world around them. The goal of these activities has been to introduce youth to deep ocean exploration, inspire interest in microbial oceanography, and foster higher education goals and career paths in related sciences for our youth. From the beginning, these lessons were developed in close working relationships between scientists and educators, and the lessons geared towards middle school have been recently piloted with the intent to maximize sustained student interest in STEM topics. While teaching these units, educators used surveys, polls, group discussions, and interviews to shed light on correlations between student interest in STEM and their close proximity to exemplary and enthusiastic educators and student leaders who are active in STEM activities such as research projects and expeditions. Educators continue to use Adopt-a-Microbe and related expedition science-based lessons to explore the broader impacts of their professional development in the Geosciences on their students’ professed interest in STEM.",

            "abstract": "To fully understand controlling factors of organic compound generation during oil shale maturation, and systematically assess associated carbon isotope values, a series of hydrous pyrolysis experiments are performed. Kerogen was isolated from Green River shale by a set of acid treatment. Experiments are conducted at 350 °C and 300 bars of total pressure with running time of 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. In each experiment, the reactor contains 1.5 grams of kerogen and 30 grams of deionized water. After experiments, gaseous products are removed under cryogenic conditions for chemical and carbon isotope analyses (GC-IRMS). The bitumen product is retrieved and separated into saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) by HPLC before subsequent analyses (GC, GC-MS, and IRMS).\nThe gaseous compounds from experiments consisted of CO2 and C1 to C4 hydrocarbons. Semiquantitative analysis indicates the yield of n-alkanes decreases with carbon number, with CO2 being more abundant than all alkanes. The δ13C value of alkanes increases with molecular weight, with CO2 having the highest value. Methane and ethane become enriched in 13C with time.\nIn bitumen products, gravimetric analysis has shown that the abundance of aromatics increases with time, while that of asphaltenes decreases. After 72 hours, the weight percentages of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes are 2.6, 42.3, 40.1, and 15.0, respectively. High resolution GC-MS results indicate low kerogen maturation after 72 hours using saturated biomarker compounds as thermal maturity indicator, such as 22S/(22S + 22R) of C31 to C35 homohopanes, tricyclics/17(H)-hopanes, and Ts/(Ts + Tm). Bulk carbon isotope value of bitumen decreases with time, with 2.5‰ lighter than original kerogen after 72 hours. In terms of different groups, saturated hydrocarbons and resins become depleted in 13C with longer reaction time, while aromatics and asphaltenes become enriched in 13C.\nExperiments with longer reaction time and under different physicochemical conditions are underway. That would facilitate a better understanding of oil and gas generation and carbon isotope systematics during kerogen maturation processes for effective conventional and unconventional exploration.",

            "abstract": "Arctic soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization processes are fundamental to the functioning of high latitude soils in relation to nutrients, stability, and feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 and climate. The arctic permafrost zone covers 25% of the northern hemisphere and contains 1672Pg of soil carbon (C). 88% of this C currently resides in frozen soils that are vulnerable to environmental change. For instance, arctic growing seasons may be lengthened, resulting in an increase in plant productivity and rate of below ground labile C inputs as root exudates. Understanding controls on Arctic SOM dynamics requires recognition that labile C inputs have the potential to significantly affect mineralization of previously stable SOM, also known as ‘priming effects’. We conducted a substrate addition incubation experiment to quantify and compare respiration in highly organic (42-48 %C) permafrost soils along a north-south transect in western Canada. Near surface soils (10-20 cm) were collected from permafrost peatland sites in the Mackenzie River Basin from 69.2-62.6°N. The surface soils are fairly young (Δ14C values > -140.0) and can be assumed to contain relatively reactive soil carbon. To assess whether addition of labile substrate alters SOM decomposition dynamics, 4.77-11.75 g of permafrost soil were spiked with 0.5 mg D-glucose g-1 soil and incubated at 5°C. A mass balance approach was used to determin substrate-induced respiration and preliminary results suggest a potential for positive priming in these C-rich soils. Baseline respiration rates from the three sites were similar (0.067-0.263 mg CO2 g-1 soil C) yet show some site-specific trends. The rate at which added substrate was utilized within these soils suggests that other factors besides temperature and soil C content are controlling substrate consumption and its effect on SOM decomposition. Microbial activity can be stimulated by substrate addition to such an extent that SOM turnover is enhanced, suggesting that soil C decay rates and processes are not constant, but depend on the inter-soil dynamics of other soil C pools. If these C rich soils contain ample C-resources to fuel extra microbial SOM decomposition, then possibly this enhanced use of SOM is not as a means of C acquisition, but to mobilize nutrients needed to meet microbial growth requirements.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) marked a fundamental change in glacial-interglacial periodicity, when it increased from ~41- to 100-kyr cycles and developed higher amplitude climate variability. Because it took place without significant changes in the Milankovitch forcing, this fundamental change must reflect either non-linear responses of the climate system to these external forcings, or internal changes in the ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system that led to longer periodicities and more intense glacial periods. We document using Nd isotopes a major disruption of the ocean thermohaline circulation (THC) system during the MPT between MIS 25-21 at ~950-860 ka, which effectively marks the first 100-kyr cycle, including an exceptional weakening through critical interglacial MIS 23 at ~900 ka. The data are from ODP Sites 1088 (41°8.163'S, 13°33.77'E, 2082m) and 1090 (42°54.82'S, 8°53.98E', 3702m) in the SE Atlantic Subantarctic Zone, near the upper and lower boundaries of NADW and Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Given evidence for nearly stable NADW and North Pacific Water (NPW) εNd-values over the last 2 Ma, we interpret the εNd variations to reflect changes in the NADW:NPW mixing fractions. During the studied pre-MPT 41-kyr world (MIS 31-25, 1,100–950 ka), at both sites the differences in glacial and interglacial εNd-values are small, indicating strong glacial as well as interglacial export of NADW. A major weakening of NADW export occurred during MIS 24-22, including MIS 23, which is unique as the only known interglacial in which the THC did not strengthen, and thus can be considered as a 'trans-glacial’ period. The recovery into the post-MPT 100-kyr world is characterized by continued weak glacial THC. We conclude that the MPT ocean circulation crisis 'rebooted' the pacing and intensity of ice ages and facilitated the coeval drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and high latitude ice sheet growth, generating the conditions that stabilized 100-kyr cycles.",

As part of the recent studies that have focused on monitoring eruptive behavior for risk reduction in this heavily populated area, we are updating the Hazard Map (1995).\nHere we present the results of the new data for the northwestern sector of the volcano where large mudflows reached 40km from the volcano toward Mexico City (14Ka). The 5Ka mudflows are overlain by several flows that covered pre-Columbian pre-classic settlements at around 2Ka BP. Buildings with ceramics from the classic and postclassic periods (around 1.5Ka and 0.9Ka BP) also indicate that settlements were abandoned and resettled several hundred years later. So far, it seems that inhabitants fled at the beginning of these larger eruptions, since no bodies have been found in the excavations. Since the XVI century, several smaller mudflows have reached the towns, but many are related with secondary deposits (for example, the Nexapa 2010 mudflow reached 15 km from the crater). Although this area has been inhabited for thousands of years, increased population shows that risk is considerable.",

            "abstract": "The state of stress in forearc regions depends on two competing factors: stress coupling along the plate interface that generates margin-normal compression, and gravity which generates margin-normal tension. Studies of focal mechanisms of small earthquakes indicate that the 2011 Tohoku earthquake changed the stress state over much of the Japan Trench forearc from margin-normal compression to tension. That is, the plate coupling effect was dominant in controlling forearc stresses before the earthquake, but the gravitational effect has become dominant after the earthquake. This change requires either (1) a nearly complete stress drop on a strong megathrust (e.g., from 50 MPa to 10 MPa) or (2) a partial stress drop of a very weak megathrust (e.g., from 15 MPa to 10 MPa). Option 1 appears to be consistent with dramatic dynamic weakening observed in high-slip-rate rock friction experiments. Option 2 is consistent with seismological observations that large earthquakes are characterized by low average stress drop values. In this work, we demonstrate that the second option is correct. We show that a weak fault, represented by an apparent coefficient of friction of ~0.03 can put the Japan Trench forearc into margin-normal compression, and lowering this value by ~0.01 can switch the forearc into tension. For the Tohoku earthquake, we determine an average stress drop value from each of the 20 published coseismic slip distributions models that were constrained by seismic, geodetic, and tsunami data. Our results reconcile seismic observations that average stress drops for large megathrust events are quite low with laboratory work on high-rate weakening which predicts very high or complete stress drop. We find that, in all the rupture models, regions of high stress drop (20 – 80 MPa) corresponding to high-rate weakening can occur, but are surrounded by regions of stress increase, so that the average stress drop remains low (< 5 MPa). The very low average stress drop during the Tohoku earthquake, consistent with values reported for other large earthquakes, makes it unambiguous that the Japan Trench megathrust is very weak. Investigating the heterogeneity of coseismic stress change also helps us understand rupture mechanics of the megathrust.",

            "abstract": "Undergraduate research experiences are important for the development of expertise in geoscience disciplines. These experiences have been shown to help students learn content and skills, promote students' cognitive and affective development, and develop students' sense of self. Early exposure to research experiences has shown to be effective in the recruitment of students, improved retention and persistence in degree programs, motivation for students to learn and increase self-efficacy, improved attitudes and values about science, and overall increased student success. Just as departments at four-year institutions (4YCs) are increasingly integrating research into their introductory courses, two-year college (2YC) geoscience faculty have a great opportunity to ground their students in authentic research. The Undergraduate Research with Two-year College Students website developed by SAGE 2YC: Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education at Two-year Colleges provides ideas and advice for 2YC and 4YC faculty who want to get more 2YC students involved in research.\nThe continuum of possibilities for faculty to explore includes things that can be done at 2YCs (eg. doing research as part of a regular course, developing a course specifically around research on a particular topic, or independent study), done in collaboration with other local institutions (eg. using their facilities, conducting joint class research, or using research to support transfer programs), and by involving students in the kind of organized Undergraduate Research programs run by a number of institutions and organizations. The website includes profiles illustrating how 2YC geoscience faculty have tackled these various models of research and addressed potential challenges such as lack of time, space, and funding as part of supporting the wide diversity of students that attend 2YCs, most of whom have less experience than that of rising seniors who are the traditional REU participant. The website also provides resources on effective strategies for developing REU programs for community college students, examples of successful multi-year programs, links to other projects working on undergraduate research in the first two years, and references for further reading.\nserc.carleton.edu/sage2yc/studentsuccess/ug-research/",

Under DoI leadership and funding, these CSCs will\nprovide scientific information tools and techniques to study impacts of climate change\nsynthesize and integrate climate change impact data\ndevelop tools that the DoI managers and partners can use when managing the DOI's land, water, fish and wildlife, and cultural heritage resources (emphasis added)\n The network of Climate Science Centers will provide decision makers with the science, tools, and information they need to address the impacts of climate variability and change on their areas of responsibility. Note from Webster, a tool is a device for doing work; it makes outcomes more realizable and more cost effective, and, in a word, better.\nPrior to the existence of CSCs, the university and federal scientific world certainly contained a large “set” of scientists with considerable strength in the physical, biological, natural, and social sciences to address the complexities and interdisciplinary nature of the challenges in the areas of climate variability, change, impacts, and adaptation. However, this set of scientists were hardly an integrated community let alone a focused team, but rather a collection of distinguished researchers, educators, and practitioners that were working with disparate though at times linked objectives, and they were rarely aligning themselves formally to an overarching strategic pathway. In addition, data, models, research results, tools, and products were generally somewhat “disconnected” from the broad range of stakeholders. I should note also that NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments ( RISA) program is an earlier “Existence Theorem” for a Federal–University Partnership to Develop Actionable and Needs-Driven Science Agendas.\nThis contribution will discuss the important cultural shift that has flowed from Secretarial Order 3289.",

            "abstract": "The bidirectional feedback between streams and aquifers changes over several spatio- temporal scales, requiring a complex, multi-variable observational network that captures the dominant processes taking place and the response to changes in hydrologic forcing. The importance of stream-aquifer connectivity is evidenced by its influence in the hydrologic response and in the fate and transport of solutes at the watershed scale. To better understand the dynamics of stream-aquifer connectivity and the effects that intra-annual weather variability has on physical and chemical processes, a monitoring network was installed at a meander bend of the East Fork of the Jemez River in the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP), a snow-dominated watershed in northern New Mexico. This work summarizes four years of observations of groundwater-surface water interaction. Spatio-temporal patterns of water level, temperature, and electrical conductivity were measured in meander-bend wells and vertical fluxes to/from the stream were estimated using in-stream piezometers, subsurface thermal records, and distributed temperature sensing in the channel. A three-dimensional numerical model was used to synthesize data and draw general conclusions. The observational network has been collecting data since the summer of 2010 to present, overlapping the Las Conchas fire in the VCNP (largest wildfire on record in New Mexico’s history), and therefore representing a valuable data set to evaluate the hydrological and biogeochemical implications of wildfire events.",

Apache OCW provides scientists and developers with tools for data manipulation, metrics for dataset comparisons, and a visualization suite. In addition to a powerful low-level API, Apache OCW also supports a web application for quick, browser-controlled evaluations, a command line application for local evaluations, and a virtual machine for isolated experimentation with minimal setup. This talk will look at the difficulties and successes of moving a closed community research project out into the wild world of open source.

Of these graduates, 37% were Hispanic or African-American and 26% were women. Our graduates are high-achievers with 13% also graduating from the Honor’s College (campus-wide rate is less than 1.5%) and that included three women and two Hispanic graduates. Two of these recent graduates are doctoral candidates and eleven are master’s candidates at major universities. Of these, three master’s candidates are Hispanic, including two women, and one doctoral candidate is a Hispanic woman.\nThe recent productivity and quality changes in this program are attributed to our shift toward an undergraduate, student-centered focus. The increases in productivity resulted from the development of strong relationships with community colleges across the state and significant efforts in recruitment and retention. The major changes in quality included implementation of a strong field-oriented focus with full faculty participation, a strong undergraduate research program, a well-developed recruitment and retention plan, a GIS Certification incorporated into the geology degree, and a culture change to further student professional development. We have maintained over 50 majors in our program for the past three years through increased faculty presentations at high-schools and community colleges, a good University recruiting staff, and quarterly newsletters, focused on student achievements, sent to all prospective students and parents inquiring about the geology major.\nThe resurgence of the oil and gas industry and the retirement of geoscientists have provided a steady stream of job opportunities for our graduates. The 79% that are not pursuing a graduate education accepted jobs after graduation. These include oil and gas entry level jobs, mining jobs, teaching jobs, and geospatial jobs. Our graduates are in high demand due to their strong field skills, research and/or GIS background and professional development, which includes a required two-credit course led by local industry professionals. These professionals also receive our program newsletter.",

            "abstract": "Mountains areas are increasingly susceptible to wildfires because of warming climates. Although knowledge of the hydro-geomorphological impacts of wildfire has advanced in recent years, much is still unknown regarding how environmental fluxes move through burned watersheds. Because of the loss of vegetation and hydrophobic soils, flash floods often accompany elevated runoff events from burned watersheds, making direct process measurements challenging. Direct measurements are also only partly successful at capturing the spatial variations of post-fire effects. Coupled with short temporal windows for observing such responses, opportunities are often missed for collecting data needed for developing predictive models. Terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) of burned areas allows detailed documentation of the post-fire topography to cm-level accuracy, providing pictures of geomorphic responses not previously possible. This paper reports a comparative study of hillslope-channel interactions, using repeat TLS, in two contrasting environments. Burned by the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire and 2013 Springs Fire, in Colorado and California respectively, the study sites share many similarities including steep erosive slopes, small drainage areas, and step-pool channel morphologies. TLS provided a tool to test the central hypothesis that, dry ravel, distinct in the California Mediterranean environment, would prompt a greater sedimentological response from the Springs Fire compared to the Waldo Canyon Fire. At selected sites in each area, TLS documented baseline conditions immediately following the fire. Repeat scanning after major storms allowed detection of changes in the landscape. Results show a tendency for sedimentation in river channels in the study sites interacting with dry ravel on hillslopes, whereas erosion dominated the response from the Waldo Canyon Fire with an absence of dry ravel. These data provide clues to developing generalizations for post-fire effects at regional scales, which could assist with managing hazards from wildfires. TLS provides a promising tool to expand the range of studies concerning environmental responses through burned landscapes.",

The advanced techniques employed include a Bayesian global multiple-event relocation process (Bayesloc), 3-D ray tracing with multipath and mini-max phase considerations, and a multi-resolution inversion technique that exploits spherical tessellation hierarchies (called PMTI). The model consists of ~1.7 million model nodes and undulating structures are explicitly represented including 7 crustal units, the Moho, and the upper mantle phase transition boundaries. Although the image was produced primarily for accurate prediction of travel times for seismic event location applications, it also provides a valuable new image with key features important for understanding mantle evolution.

            "abstract": "During IODP Expedition 348 from October 2013 to January 2014, Site C0002 was drilled to more than 3000 meters’ depth into the inner accretionary wedge at the Nankai Trough, setting a new depth record for scientific ocean drilling. It is the first hole to access the deep interior of an active convergent margin. Site C0002 is part of the NanTroSEIZE project off the Kii-Kumano region of Japan, designed to shed light on plate boundary fault zone processes near the up-dip edge of seismogenic locking and slip. The zone from 865 – 3056 meters below the sea floor was sampled via logging-while-drilling measurements, continuous sampling of drill cuttings, and limited coring. This interval was composed of lithified middle to late Miocene hemipelagic sediments and turbidites that are markedly deformed and dip steeply. P-wave speeds from sonic logs increase with depth to ~ 1600 meters, but are constant to slightly decreasing with depth from 1600 to 3050 meters. We hypothesize that this change in trend indicates the onset of elevated pore fluid pressure, but structural and lithologic factors may also play a role. We explore several methods for quantitative estimation of sonic-derived fluid pressure conditions in the inner wedge. A borehole leak-off test (LOT) and a series of borehole pressurization and injection tests were also performed, which we synthesize to estimate the least principal stress, or Shmin. Furthermore, downhole pressure while drilling (PWD) measurements recorded during borehole packoff events provide information on the maximum principal stress, SHmax. Taken together, the LOT and PWD observations suggest that the inner wedge at ~ 2000 meters depth is currently in a strike-slip stress regime, despite its position as the hanging wall of a main plate boundary thrust. This may be a transitional stress regime between shallow normal and deep thrust, controlled by depth-dependent magnitude of the tectonic convergence-related principal stress. Our results document for the first time the stress conditions and material properties in the deep interior of the upper plate to the shallow seismogenic zone.",

Weak and porous shale and sandstone bedrock, high levels of precipitation during the monsoon season, steep hillslopes, and unregulated development contribute to this problem. M > 7 earthquakes along megathrusts beneath the Burma Fold Belt could trigger over 1,100 landslides and endanger over 300,000 people, increasing the severity of the landslide risk. In this study, we surveyed two slides in the south and east parts of Aizawl and from crack orientations we have inferred ground motion and created vector maps of the two slides. A shallow slope stability analysis (SHALSTAB) for the Aizawl area enabled us to map zones of relative hazard in Aizawl and the vicinity. Our SHALSTAB analysis suggests that 44% of our study area in Aizawl is unconditionally unstable. Similarly, preliminary results from a Newmark Deformation Analysis indicate that nearly 50% of our study area would result in landslide-inducing displacement under seismic loading from a magnitude 7 event. Both results indicate unconditionally unstable conditions in the south and east sides of Aizawl, which agree with our field investigation. We are analyzing Interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data collected between 1998 and 2010 that we hope will demonstrate a seasonal time series of slope deformation for the region and determine slide velocities. With data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) we expect to confirm a correlation between slope movement and landslide occurrence with seasonal and annual precipitation.",

            "abstract": "This paper will present the results of large-scale three-dimensional calculations simulating the hydrological-mechanical behavior of a CO2 injection reservoir and the resulting effects on wellbore casings and sealant repair materials. A critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations in local stress that can compromise seal integrity. The DOE-NETL project “Wellbore Seal Repair Using Nanocomposite Materials,” is interested in the stress-strain history of abandoned wells, as well as changes in local pressure, stress, and temperature conditions that accompany carbon dioxide injection or brine extraction.\nTwo distinct computational models comprise the current modeling effort. The first is a field scale model that uses the stratigraphy, material properties, and injection history from a pilot CO2 injection operation in Cranfield, MS to develop a stress-strain history for wellbore locations from 100 to 400 meters from an injection well. The results from the field scale model are used as input to a more detailed model of a wellbore casing. The 3D wellbore model examines the impacts of various loading scenarios on a casing structure. This model has been developed in conjunction with bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up being used to test candidate seal repair materials. The results from these models will be used to estimate the necessary mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) under Grant Number DE-FE0009562.

            "abstract": "Composition discernment, fraction calculation and morphological analysis of a shallow core retrieved from Barrow, AK as part of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments in the Arctic (NGEE-Arctic) were conducted to give a quantitative description of the core. Imaging of the core was performed using a medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, which gives a 3D image with a resolution of 0.195×0.195×0.625mm3. The core consists mainly of mineral, ice, organic matter and air and composition discernment and fraction calculation focus on the first three materials. Four scans with different energies were performed because materials with different density show different responses on scans with varying energies. A calibration curve showing the relationship between density and CT value was built by scanning standard materials having a wide range of density. CT value of the three compositions under four energies was determined by the calibration curve and the core scan. Composition fraction was calculated on the assumption that the core CT value is linearly proportional to the composition fraction and by solving linear least-squares problems with bounds. Comparison of the estimated and measured core CT value shows that the correlation coefficient is more than 0.99, indicating the accuracy of the calculation. Two regions with relatively high fraction of organic matter (10%) were distinguished, which are located at the top of the core and ice filled fractures at the bottom of the active layer. Morphological analysis was applied to the mineral and ice because of low fraction of organic matter. Three segmentations corresponding to ice-rich (with a density of 0.86 to 1.24 g/cm3), transition from ice to mineral (1.24 to 1.47 g/cm3) and mineral-rich (1.47 to 2.65 g/cm3) were applied to the core, and two area (area and area standard deviation) and three morphological (circulatory, roundness and rectangularity) parameters were analysed. By conducting Principle Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, two principle components were distinguished from the five parameters, giving a quantitative description of the core. The study provides an innovative approach to quantitatively describe the arctic core, which may provide help in understanding geomorphological changes as a result of climate variation in the arctic.",

            "abstract": "The magnetopause marks the boundary between the shocked solar wind and magnetospheric plasma. Understanding the dynamics of the plasma processes at the magnetopause boundary is crucial to the study of plasma transport into the magnetosphere. Previous studies have shown that there exists a temperature asymmetry in the plasma sheet. During northward IMF, the cold component ions are 30-40% hotter in the dawn flank plasma sheet compared to the dusk flank. However, the mechanisms responsible are still not entirely clear. Recent work has shown that reconnection in Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices can transport plasma into the magnetosphere. Previous studies have also shown that mode conversion at the magnetopause can generate kinetic Alfvén wave activity. Both magnetic reconnection and plasma wave activity can heat plasma. For the first time we have determined from observations the dispersion relation of higher frequency waves responsible for plasma mixing and heating within a KH vortex.",

            "abstract": "The role of volatiles in the petrogenesis of alkaline intra-plate magmas has been the subject of an increasing number of experimental studies. The study of naturally occurring rocks and their volatile contents is often complicated by syn- and post-eruptive degassing and alteration processes. Minerals that incorporate volatiles into their structure such as apatites are often more faithful recorders of the pre-eruptive volatile budget.\nThe Hegau volcanic field in Southwest Germany is part of the Central European Volcanic Province, lies around 60-70 km to the east of the Upper Rhine graben and of Miocene age. Three main lithological units can be distinguished (1) olivine melilites (2) phonolites and (3) the \"Deckentuff\" series referring to a series of diatreme-filling pipe breccias and lapilli tuff layers. Carbonatites occur subordinately in the Hegau province. Earlier radiometric age dating suggested distinct phases of volcanic activity of Deckentuffs, melilites and phonolites with little overlap, but new apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He age data suggest a synchronous activity.\nApatite is an abundant accessory phase in the Deckentuff and phonolite series and we investigated its major, trace and volatile element composition by EPMA, SIMS and cathodoluminescence imaging. Pronounced core-rim zoning of apatite in places attests that diffusional equilibration was very limited and they likely retained their primary compositions. This allows us to trace the entire magmatic evolution of the Hegau province from its most primitive to most evolved products as well as resolve it in time by combining age dating with compositional analysis.\nApatite compositions fall along the OH-F join with low Cl-contents (<0.5 wt%). Volatile contents (Cl, OH, S) are highest in most primitive compositions and decrease with further evolution while F increases. Multiple magmatic cycles can be discerned with a general trend to the more evolved phonolite compositions toward the end of volcanic activity.",

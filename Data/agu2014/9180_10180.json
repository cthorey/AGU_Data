            "abstract": "The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol has led to reductions in stratospheric halogen loading, which is expected to result in less chemical depletion of ozone and thus increased stratospheric ozone amounts [WMO, 2011]. To unambiguously identify a positive ozone response directly attributable to declining halogen levels, consistent long-term ozone profile observations are required. Although near-global satellite observations of the ozone profile have been made since 1978, no single instrument has covered this entire period, meaning that merged data series combining several instrument records are required to fully understand long-term ozone changes.\nAll available long-term data sets are analysed for trends in the period 1979-2012. The data sets are based on a varying combination of instruments including SBUV/2, SAGE-2, HALOE, UARS-MLS, OSIRIS, SAGE-3, GOMOS, ACE-FTS, and Aura-MLS. The analyses reveal that all data sets represent seasonality and interannual variability well, with those data sets based on the same instrument set tending to be more similar, despite different merging techniques being used. A multiple linear regression analysis reveals that long-term ozone trends are similar in the period prior to 1997, but show more diversity for the period since 1998. This is likely a result of the different instruments used to construct each data set, which vary more in the latter period. These results have important implications in terms of the detection of ozone recovery resulting from the reduction in stratospheric halogen loading. This work was done as part of the Si2N (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC), the International Ozone Commission (IOC), the ozone focus area of the Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations (IGACO-O3), and the Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) - SPARC/IOC/IGACO-O3/NDACC) initiative.",

            "abstract": "Predicting river channel evolution relies on an understanding of when and at what rate coarse sediment moves in a channel. Unfortunately, our predictive abilities are limited by the logistical challenges and potential dangers inherent in current techniques for monitoring sediment transport during flood events, especially in steep, highly active landscapes. However, the use of seismic signals near rivers shows promise as a safe, low-cost method for studying sediment transport in these settings. Seismic signals near rivers are partially generated by both water turbulence and bedload sediment particles impacting the river bed during transport. Here, we attempt to isolate the seismic signatures of discharge and bedload transport in a steep mountain channel by examining high-frequency broadband seismic data from the well-studied Erlenbach stream (local slope of ~10%) in the Swiss Prealps. The extensive monitoring infrastructure and long history of sediment transport data at this field site allow us to independently constrain discharge, precipitation, and bedload transport during flood events over a two month field campaign. We perform a general linear least squares inversion of the seismic data, exploiting times with isolated rain or discharge events, to identify the spectral signals of water turbulence, rain, and bedload sediment transport. We find that the signal generated by rain exhibits a roughly broadband spectrum, while discharge and sediment transport exhibit power primarily in lower frequency bands. Our preliminary results indicate that with only precipitation and discharge data, it is possible to isolate the seismic signal of bedload transport in steep fluvial environments. Seismic studies may therefore have the potential to revolutionize our ability to monitor and understand these environments.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of the magnetostratigraphy of Arctic Ocean sediments is muddled by multiple reversals that start a few meters below the sea floor. This level, which was earlier interpreted as the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary, roughly coincides with the base of Marine Isotope Stage 6 (ca. 128 ka). Results of thermal demagnetization and analyses of magnetic extracts led Channell and Xuan (2010) to propose a self-reversal mechanism caused by oxidation of primary titanomagnetite to secondary titanomaghemite. We present a detailed study of the natural remanent magnetization acquired by the 7 m long core LR12-PC06, which was collected from the Lomonosov Ridge during the LOMROG expedition in 2012 and can be directly correlated to the ACEX depth scale by grain size and density profiles. Similar to previous studies, the magnetic directions of many initially normally magnetized samples trended towards reversed during alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to 100 mT, although this change was often associated with a significant increase in intensity. Experiments investigating the possibility of spurious laboratory magnetizations as a cause of the aforementioned intensity increase included increasing the AF level to 120 mT. In contrast to previous studies employing less intense fields, our more intense fields removed the reversed component and directions returned to normal. While our trial study of LR12-PC06 is by no means conclusive, it shows that one component, with a relatively narrow and medium coercivity spectrum, acquired a reversed natural remanence that is superimposed upon a normal magnetization with a wider coercivity spectrum and multiple possible contributors. We suggest that the reversed component, when characterized by a narrow coercivity spectrum, can be considered as a secondary magnetization, probably acquired by a rapidly formed and fine grained diagenetic mineral. Our applied method and results may help discriminate between true and apparent reversal boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Particle aggregation is a key process that significantly affects dispersal and sedimentation of volcanic ash, with obvious implications for the associated hazards. Most theoretical studies of particle aggregation have been based on the Smoluchowski Coagulation Equation (SCE), which describes the expected time evolution of the total grain-size distribution under the hypothesis that particles can collide and stick together following specific mathematical relations (kernels). Nonetheless, the practical application of the SCE to real erupting scenarios is made extremely difficult – if not even impossible - by the large number of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) which have to be solved to study the typical sizes of volcanic ash (1 micron to 1 mm). We propose an algorithm to approximate the discrete solutions of the SCE, which can describe the time evolution of the total grain-size distribution of the erupted material with an increased computational efficiency. This algorithm has been applied to observed volcanic eruptions (i.e., Eyjafjallajokull 2010, Sakurajima 2013 and Mt. Saint Helens 1980) to see if the commonly used kernels can explain field data and to study how aggregation processes can modify the tephra dispersal on the ground. Different scenarios of sticking efficiencies and aggregate porosity have been used to test the sensitiveness of the SCE to these parameters. Constraints on these parameters come from field observations and laboratory experiments.",

A geothermal gradient of 36°C km-1 suggests that such subsurface granites form an economically viable hot dry rock reservoir at > 4 km depth. In order to assess the likelihood of reactivating any pre-existing fractures during hydraulic reservoir stimulation, slip and dilation tendency analyses (Morris et al. 1996) were carried out. For this purpose, we determined orientations of pre-existing fractures in 14 granite exposures along the southern border fault of an MGCR basement high. Additionally, the strike of 192 Permian magmatic dikes affecting the granite was considered. This analysis revealed a prevalence of NW-SE-striking fractures (mainly joints, extension veins, dikes and subordinately brittle faults) with a maximum at 030/70 (dip azimuth/dip).\nBorehole data and earthquake focal mechanisms reveal a maximum horizontal stress SHmax trending N150°E and a strike-slip regime. Effective in-situ stress magnitudes at 4.5 km depth, assuming hydrostatic conditions and frictional equilibrium along pre-existing fractures with a friction coefficient of 0.85 yielded 230 and 110 MPa for SHmax and Shmin, respectively. In this stress field, fractures with the prevailing orientations show a high tendency of becoming reactivated as dextral strike-slip faults if stimulated hydraulically. To ensure that a stimulation well creates fluid connectivity on a reservoir volume as large as possible rather than dissipating fluids along existing fractures, it should follow a trajectory at the highest possible angle to the orientation of prevailing fractures, i.e. subhorizontal and NE-SW-oriented.\n",

The melt distribution in this area is very heterogeneous, with corridors of ultramafic seafloor where plate separation is accommodated by large offset normal faults [Sauter, Cannat et al., 2013]. These ultramafic corridors also expose rare gabbros and basalts. We use the major and trace elements composition of these magmatic rocks to document the petrogenesis of MORB in this exceptionnally low melt supply portion of the MOR system.\nBasalts from the easternmost SWIR represent a global MORB end-member for major element compositions [Meyzen et al., 2003], with higher Na2O and Al2O3 wt%, and lower CaO and FeO wt% at a given MgO. Within this group, basalts from the ultramafic corridors have particularly high Na2O, low CaO and FeO wt%. Best fitting calculated liquid lines of descent are obtained for crystallization pressures of ~8 kbar.\nGabbroic rocks recovered in the ultramafic corridors include gabbros, oxide-gabbros and variably impregnated peridotites. This presentation focuses on these impregnated samples, where cpx have high Mg#, yet are in equilibrium with the nearby basalts in terms of their trace element compositions. Plagioclase An contents vary over a broad range, and there is evidence for opx resorption. These characteristics result from melt-mantle interactions in the axial lithosphere, which may explain several peculiar major element characteristics of the basalts. Similar interactions probably occur beneath ridges at intermediate to slow and ultraslow spreading rates. We propose that they are particularly significant in our study area due to its exceptionnally low integrated melt-rock ratio.",

            "abstract": "Model parameters can introduce significant uncertainties in climate simulations. Sensitivity analysis provides a way to quantify such uncertainties. Existing sensitivity analysis, however, cannot estimate the maximum sensitivity in climate simulations due to parameter uncertainties. In this study, we propose a new concept of nonlinear ensemble parameter perturbation (NEPP) to estimate the maximum effect of parameter uncertainties on the simulation of Earth’s climate. The NEPP is obtained by solving a maximization problem which is defined by the maximum variation of a unique ensemble of short-term predictions with large enough members and whose gradient is estimated by an ensemble-based approach. This method is applied to investigate the maximum variation of the climate of Lorenz-63 model and a sophisticated climate model, respectively, caused by uncertain parameters. It is found that the NEPP method is capable of estimating the maximum sensitivity in climate simulations due to parameter uncertainties. The results also illustrate that there is a high relevance between short-term prediction sensitivities and long-term climatic sensitivities. Apart from being independent of the initial conditions, the NEPP belongs to the most unstable mode of parameter perturbation for the model climate. Furthermore, the NEPP depends only weakly on, although related to, the time scales of short-term predictions.",

            "abstract": "We perform a Bayesian statistical analysis on historical and late Holocene rates of sea-level change. The data that form the input to the statistical model are tide-gauge measurements and proxy reconstructions from cores of coastal sediment. The aims are to estimate rates of sea-level change, to determine when modern rates of rise began and to observe how these rates have evolved over time. Many current methods for doing this use simple linear regression to estimate rates. This is often inappropriate as it is too rigid and it can ignore uncertainties that arise as part of the data collection exercise. This can lead to over-confidence in the sea-level trends being characterized.\nThe proposed model places a Gaussian process prior on the rate process (i.e. the process that determines how rates of sea-level are changing over time). The likelihood of the observed data is the integral of this process. When dealing with proxy reconstructions, the model is set in an errors-in-variables framework so as to take account of age uncertainty. It is also necessary to account for glacio-isostatic adjustment, which introduces a covariance between individual age and sea-level observations. This method allows for the estimation of the rate process with full consideration of all sources of uncertainty.\nThe model captures the continuous and dynamic evolution of sea-level change and results show that modern rates of rise are consistently increasing. Analysis of a global tide-gauge record (Church and White, 2011) indicated that the rate of sea-level rise increased continuously since 1880AD and is currently 1.9mm/yr (95% credible interval of 1.84 to 2.03mm/yr). Applying the model to a proxy reconstruction from North Carolina (Kemp et al., 2011) indicated that the mean rate of rise in this locality since the middle of the 19th century (current rate of 2.44 mm/yr with a 95% credible interval of 1.91 to 3.01mm/yr) is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years.",

Such type of intracontinental CO2-fluxes remain poorly constrained at the scale of the global C-cycle. We report here the first quantification of the CO2 volumes stored in the lithospheric mantle, by coupling geochemical and 3D micro-tomography studies of lherzolitic and harzburgitic mantle xenoliths. The Pannonian Basin xenolith peridotites present numerous signs of melt/fluid migration. The compositions of glasses found in the peridotites vary from sub-alkaline (Na2O + K2O = 3.8 wt. %) to alkaline (Na2O + K2O = 12.6 wt. %) and from mafic (SiO2 = 48.2 wt. %) to more felsic (SiO2 = 62.1 wt. %) compositions and differ markedly from the host basalts of the xenoliths. Microthermometric and Raman spectroscopic studies on fluid inclusions (n = 115) show pure CO2 compositions with densities range between 0.6 and 0.9 g.cm3 [290 to 735 MPa (PCO2)], corresponding to deep fluid trapping on both sides of the Moho. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography (Micro-CT), together with laboratory micro-CT were performed to obtain information about structure, volume and density of each phase (minerals, melts and fluids). Fluids and melts are mainly located at grain boundaries and secondary trails cut off the grain boundaries, which implies a contemporary introduction of such fluids [Figure 1]. The amount of fluid inclusions in xenoliths is heterogeneous and varied from 0.79 ± 0.15 to 4.58 ± 0.54 vol % of the peridotite. The carbon-dioxide content stored in the lithospheric mantle, due to the percolation of asthenospheric melts produced in the mantle beneath the Pannonian Basin, can be estimated by the combination of 3D reconstruction (Micro-CT) and CO2 pressures from inclusions.\n[1] B.

            "abstract": "Several climate modelling studies in the past have used reduction in solar constant to simulate the climatic effects of Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering. This is most likely valid only for space-based mirrors/reflectors but not for SRM methods that rely on stratospheric aerosols. In this study, we use a climate model to evaluate the differences in climate response to SRM by uniform solar constant reduction and stratospheric aerosols. The experiments are designed such that global mean warming from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration (2xCO2) is nearly cancelled in each case. In such a scenario, the residual climate effects are similar when important surface and tropospheric climate variables such as temperature and precipitation are considered. However, there are significant differences in stratospheric temperature response and diffuse and direct radiation reaching the surface. A difference of 1K in the global mean stratospheric (61-9.8 hPa) temperature is simulated between the two SRM methods, with warming in the aerosol scheme and a slight cooling for sunshades.\nWhile the global mean surface diffuse radiation increases by ~23% and direct radiation decreases by about 9% in the case of aerosol SRM method, both direct and diffuse radiation decrease by similar fractional amounts (~1.0%) when solar constant is reduced. When CO2 fertilization effects from elevated CO2 concentration levels are removed, the contribution from shaded leaves to gross primary productivity (GPP) increases by 1.8 % in aerosol SRM because of increased diffuse light. However, this increase is almost offset by a 15.2% decline in sunlit contribution due to reduced direct light. Overall both the SRM simulations show similar decrease in GPP (~ 8%) and NPP (~3%) relative to 2xCO2, indicating the negligible effect of the fractional changes in direct/diffuse radiation on the overall plant productivity. Based on our modelling study, we conclude that the climate states produced by a reduction in solar constant and addition of aerosols into the stratosphere can be considered almost similar except for two important aspects: stratospheric temperature change and the partitioning of direct versus diffuse radiation reaching the surface.",

            "abstract": "Estimates show that in 2005, in the largest 136 coastal cities, there were 40 million people and $3,000 billion of assets exposed to 1 in 100 year coastal flood events. Mean sea level rise will increase this exposure to 150 million people and $35,000 billion of assets by 2070. Any further change in the statistics of flood frequency or severity would impact severely on economic and social systems. It is therefore crucial to understand the physical drivers of extreme storm surges, and to have confidence in datasets used for extreme sea level statistics. Much previous research has focussed on the process of tide-surge interaction, and it is now widely accepted that the physical basis of tide-surge interaction is that a phase shift of the tidal signal represents the effect of the surge on the tide. The second aspect of interaction is that shallow water momentum considerations imply that differing tidal states should modulate surge generation: wind stress should have greater surge-generating potential on lower tides.\nWe present results from a storm surge model of the European shelf that demonstrate that tidal range does have an effect on the surges generated. The cycle-integrated effects of wind stress (i.e. the skew surge) are greater when tidal range is low. Our results contradict the absence of any such correlation in tide gauge records. This suggests that whilst the modulating effect of the tide on the skew surge (the time-independent difference between peak prediction and observations) is significant, the difference between individual storms is dominant. This implies that forecasting systems must predict salient detail of the most intense storms. A further implication is that flood forecasting models need to simulate tides with acceptable accuracy at all coastal locations. We extend our model analysis to show that the same modulation of storm surges (by tidal conditions) applies to tropical cyclones. We conduct simulations using a mature operational storm surge model in the Bay of Bengal with tropical cyclones from the IBTrACs database; we demonstrate that – just as with the extra-tropical case - higher storm surges on the Bangladesh coastline are generated during smaller tides.",

These projects include continuous trace gas measurements, fog isotope sampling, in situ surface radiation measurements, land surface temperature and other satellite validation studies, and multiple aerosol/dust monitoring projects; most of these projects are also components in other global monitoring networks. To these projects, Gobabeb has recently added a network of nine autonomous weather stations spanning the central Namib that will continuously collect basic meteorological data over an area of approximately 70x70 km. Using this data in conjunction with modeling efforts will expand our understanding of fog formation and the linkages between fog and the Benguela Current off Namibia’s coast. Historical weather data from previous meteorological stations and satellite observations will also enable development of a fog time series for the last 50 years to determine climate variability driven by possible changes in the Benguela Current system. To complement these efforts, Gobabeb is also expanding its decades-old ecological research programs to explore the impacts of the fog on the region’s biota at various time and spatial scales. Gobabeb’s long-term, multidisciplinary projects can serve as a prototype for monitoring in other fog-affected systems, together increasing our understanding of coastal fog dynamics, land-atmosphere-ocean connections, and the impacts of fog-related global change.",

            "abstract": "Aseismic slip is a key component of the moment budget of subduction zones, in some cases it accounts for more than half the total slip. It has been suggested that the propagation of aseismic slip as slow slip sequences precedes large megathrust events, such as the Tohoku-oki earthquake, Mw 9.0, 11th March 2011. Complex patterns of aseismic slip in space and time have been observed using either GPS data or repeating earthquakes, yet the physical mechanisms driving this behaviour are still poorly understood and have implications for seismic hazard assessment. Therefore, in this study both these datasets are combined in a time-dependent inversion, to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of aseismic slip in northeast Japan, during the interseismic period of 21st March 1996 to 29th October 2003.\nDaily displacements recorded by ~800 GEONET stations are associated with slip on the subducting plate interface using a time-dependent inverse modelling scheme. The bounds on slip are defined by the location and slip of repeating earthquakes. Initial results show significant slip heterogeneity along-strike and down-dip. The majority of the upper part of the plate, at depths of 5 – 30 km, is locked except for two patches at 37° and 40° latitude. At 30 – 70 km depth there are three regions of aseismic slip, which exhibit periodic acceleration and deceleration throughout the interseismic period; in the south near Tokyo, offshore Sendai, and the northernmost part of Honshu at 41.5° latitude. Within these regions, patches with an average velocity of 7 to 8 cm/yr show large fluctuations in velocity, which in some cases precede the smaller variations observed for patches with an average velocity of 2 to 4 cm/yr. These observations are discussed in terms of the changes in effective normal stress, and the heterogeneous frictional properties of the northeast Japan subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Users of earthquake planning scenarios require the ground-motion map to be credible enough to justify costly planning efforts, but not all ground-motion maps are right for all uses. There are two common ways to create a map of ground motion for a hypothetical earthquake. One approach is to map the median shaking estimated by empirical attenuation relationships. The other uses 3-D physics-based modeling, in which one analyzes a mathematical model of the earth's crust near the fault rupture and calculates the generation and propagation of seismic waves from source to ground surface by first principles. The two approaches produce different-looking maps. The more-familiar median maps smooth out variability and correlation. Using them in a planning scenario can lead to a systematic underestimation of damage and loss, and could leave a community underprepared for realistic shaking. The 3-D maps show variability, including some very high values that can disconcert non-scientists. So when the USGS Science Application for Risk Reduction’s (SAFRR) Haywired scenario project selected 3-D maps, it was necessary to explain to scenario users—especially engineers who often use median maps—the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the two approaches. We used authority, empirical evidence, and theory to support our choice. We prefaced our explanation with SAFRR’s policy of using the best available earth science, and cited the credentials of the maps’ developers and the reputation of the journal in which they published the maps. We cited recorded examples from past earthquakes of extreme ground motions that are like those in the scenario map. We explained the maps on theoretical grounds as well, explaining well established causes of variability: directivity, basin effects, and source parameters. The largest mapped motions relate to potentially unfamiliar extreme-value theory, so we used analogies to human longevity and the average age of the oldest person in samples of varying sizes to illustrate extreme values to non-scientists. We explained the importance of nonlinearity in the relationship between shaking and loss. This was the second time SAFRR encountered skeptics of 3-D maps among scenario consumers, so a short manuscript was prepared that would serve similar uses in the future.",

This is project is the result of a wide scientific collaboration between institutions of Mexico and Spain with the main aim of studying the lithospheric structure in Rivera and North American Plates convergence regions and Jalisco Block, and, also, identifying submarine structures that could be tsunamigenic sources.\nThe first phase of this project was carried out in February and March of 2014. More than 5200 km of Multichannel Seismic Reflection (MCS) data were acquired, together with multibeam and parametric soundings and potential fields (gravity and magnetism) data. Wide Angle profiling were recorded deploying 16 OBS in 32 locations, offshore Jalisco and Nayarit regions Onshore, a network of 100 short period seismic portable stations were deployed in 240 locations along 5 seismic lines of 200-300 km length that worked combined with Seismological Network of Jalisco State (SisVOc). In addition, 8 land seismic stations were installed in Marías Islands and Isabel Island. These instruments registered, in continuous mode, the source energy was generated by big airgun array of 5800 ci, shooting every 120 s. The British vessel RRS James Cook, which participated in this project as a part of the exchange program between Spanish and English scientific vessels, was responsible of carrying out the MCS profiles and the deployment of OBS. For them, it was used a 6 km length digital streamer and airgun array of high capacity. Moreover, the ARM Holzinger and RV El Puma participated in this project and were provided by the Mexican Navy and UNAM, respectively.\nThe second phase of this project was carried out in June 2014. 100 short period seismic stations were installed along one seismic profile from La Caldera de la Primavera (Guadalajara) to Barra de Navidad (Jalisco coast), covering 200 km distance.\nThe new data acquired during TSUJAL project provide a dense sampling of studied plates and give new seismic images about continental deformation along and across the subduction zone, accretionary wedge size, about contact between Rivera and North American Plates.",

            "abstract": "Crustal faults are complex systems whose mechanical conditions and physical properties vary in space and time. The availability of long time series of high-resolution multidisciplinary data is a fundamental requirement to understand the multi-scale physical processes controlling faulting and earthquake generation processes. A crucial step for the seismological community is the availability of high-resolution catalogues of accurate earthquake locations describing the long-term brittle response of the fault activity.\nWe report on the seismicity recorded in a sector of the Northern Apennines undergoing active extension and where a set of high-angle normal faults is detached by the Alto Tiberina low-angle normal fault (ATF). From 2010, this area hosts a research infrastructure (the Alto Tiberina Near Fault Observatory, TABOO), consisting of a dense array of multi-sensor stations, devoted to studying the earthquakes preparatory phase and the fast and slow deformation processes along the ATF fault system.\nWe show the location of about 30k low-magnitude earthquakes recorded during the past 4 years (2010-2014) showing a completeness magnitude of the catalogue of ML0.5. Data have been analyzed by combining an automatic picking procedure for P and S waves, together with cross-correlation and double-difference location methods.\nThe seismicity pattern shows an almost constant and high rate of seismic release along the ATF plane (r = 24.30e−04 eqks/day*km2) with clusters of similar events identified all along the fault plane. On the contrary a long series of low magnitude seismic sequences (Mmax 4.0) activated minor synthetic and antithetic normal faults segments (4–5 km long) located in the main fault hanging-wall. The geometry of the fault segments described by the seismicity distribution is cinematically consistent with the focal mechanisms solutions.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the large-scale deformation of the India-Eurasia collision zone has been pursued for more than 4 decades. However, the driving forces for the largest area of continental deformation zone on earth have not been entirely resolved; the source of such driving forces remains enigmatic. One reason could be that the driving forces have to be sufficiently large to overcome the resistance of the Tibetan Plateau, created by excess gravitational potential energy (GPE) over a long time span. Another reason is that seismic experiments carried out in the Tibetan Plateau, due to the harsh natural conditions, are fewer, making it challenging to resolve high-resolution seismic structure beneath Tibet. We address this issue of driving forces in this deformation zone by quantifying the primary contributions to the lithospheric stress field. We take into account effects of topography and shallow lithosphere structure, as well as tractions originating from deeper mantle convection, in order to calculate model estimates of the total lithosphere stresses. We evaluate recent published global seismic tomographic models (P-wave, S-wave, and geodynamic models) and select a tomographic model which, when used in the semi-analytical mantle circulation model HC (Hager and O'Connell, 1981; Milner et al., 2009), provides a best fit to observations of geoid, surface motions, strain rates, and stress orientations. We use the joint modeling of lithosphere and mantle dynamics approach of Ghosh and Holt (2012) to compute the full lithosphere stresses, except that we use HC for the circulation model, which can only handle radial viscosity variations. After using the selected seismic tomographic model of SAW642AN (Panning and Romanowicz, 2006) to compute the global lithosphere stresses, we refine the calculated stresses in the India-Eurasia collision zone. Our results show that both the driving stresses from mantle convection and GPE differences contribute to the deviatoric stress field in this area. The mantle convection influence, consisting of significant downwelling of negative density buoyancies beneath Tibet and Indian Plate, contributes to the NE-SW compressional stresses, whereas the GPE differences contribute the North-South rifts and the clockwise rotation of motions around the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis.",

The analysis reveals that (1) the mean frequency spectrum of density variations in the MHD range (up to about 0.05 Hz) is steeper than usually discussed –5/3, and (2) this part is followed by a plateau that is terminated near proton kinetic scales.

            "abstract": "The eastern segment of the Hellenic Arc and Trench system is characterized by the occurrence of large earthquakes and tsunamis known from both the historical and geological record particularly in Rhodes Isl. (Greece). Historical sources maintain direct evidence of coseismic uplift in the eastern coast of Rhodes, e.g. the very large earthquake of 12 October 1856 (M~7.5), caused ground uplift while the sea receded permanently. Similar observations have been made regarding the earthquake of c. 227 BC who caused the collapse of Colossus in Rhodes and the tsunamigenic earthquake of c. AD 142. Such observations, supported by the instrumental record of seismicity, make realistic the suggestion that the historical earthquakes had their epicenters offshore but close to Rhodes city. However, in SW Asia Minor at the opposite side of Rhodes, coastal subsidence was reported as a result of the strong earthquake sequence of February-April 1851. The occurrence of strong tsunamis after some earthquakes is an independent evidence for significant, submarine coseismic fault displacement very likely in the Rhodes Abyssal Plain of water depth up to 3 km. On the other hand, geological observations have indicated that the eastern side of Rhodes has systematically uplifted during the Holocene with uplift amplitude increasing from S to N with average velocity ranging from 0 in Prasonisi at south to 1 mm/yr at the NE side of the island where coseismic uplift was reported historically. We compare the historical rate of uplift with the geologically estimated rate. To this aim we compiled a new catalogue of historical earthquakes that caused coseismic uplift in the coastal zone of Rhodes city and adopted that they had their epicenters offshore but very close to the city. From damage descriptions maximum macroseismic intensity was assigned to each one of the earthquakes. Then intensity was converted to earthquake magnitude from empirical relationships found for instrumental Greek earthquakes. The geological and historical uplift rates were compared and seismotectonic implications were discussed from the point of view of the possible surplus or deficit of the historical uplift versus the geological uplift and the resulting potential stress accumulation.",

            "abstract": "The initial analyses of the Ulysses and IBEX interstellar neutral (ISN) gas observations showed small but significant differences in the ISN flow parameters. In particular, the IBEX observations have defined a narrow and tightly coupled tube in the 4-dimensional ISN parameter space (temperature and inflow speed, longitude, and latitude), which extended to the original Ulysses flow vector but with a somewhat different optimum set of values. However, adopting the Ulysses velocity vector resulted in a significantly higher temperature. Interestingly, the optimum flow vector obtained with IBEX resulted in the same temperature obtained from the Ulysses GAS analysis. These intriguing results were the starting point for a hypothesis that then was tested with a literature study from the past four decades, i.e., that the flow direction of interstellar He may be changing over time.\nHere, we analyze the data from both experiments using the Warsaw Test Particle Model, i.e., same simulation program and ionization rate model. For Ulysses GAS, we use the original data set and, in addition, the same set reprocessed with improved information on the instrument pointing in the sky. For IBEX, we model a subtle, previously unaccounted for data throughput issue for the first two observation seasons, and we analyze, for the first time, data from the two most recent seasons, when the data throughput issue was eliminated through a mode change and when the IBEX pointing strategy was changed to improve the sensitivity of the observations to tighten the possible range of the ISN flow parameters. In addition, we have refined the data uncertainty system, improved the analysis of the IBEX pointing information, and we now explicitly take into account the newly discovered Warm Breeze.\nIn combination, we present the ISN velocity vector relative to the Sun and the He temperature for the entire Ulysses GAS observations and the past two IBEX-Lo observation seasons as a time series from 1994 until 2014.",

            "abstract": "United States forests and wood products have been a significant and persistent carbon sink of 100-200 million tons annually since 1950, currently offsetting about 12% of U.S. emissions of CO2. This carbon sink is caused by recovery of forest C stocks following timber harvest and abandonment of agricultural land over the last 150 years, and more recently the growth-enhancing effects of N deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and climate variability. The forest carbon sink would have been significantly larger if not for continued losses of forest to other land uses such as urban development, and increasing impacts from natural disturbances such as fire and insect outbreaks. Projections of the future U.S. C sink have raised concerns that it may disappear in a few decades because of slower growth, continued losses of forest area, and increasing demand for timber products especially bioenergy. However, continuing atmospheric and climate changes may delay this projected decline in the sink strength for another 50 years or longer. Research is urgently needed to improve projections of land-use changes and demand for timber, quantify the large-scale effects of atmospheric change and climate variability, and develop modeling approaches that can effectively integrate these multiple factors. Policy decisions to meet emissions reduction targets are partially dependent on assumptions about the magnitude of the future forest carbon sink; therefore, it is important to have convincing projections about how these various driving factors will affect forests in the future.",

The thickness of the layered and virtually undeformed oceanic crust, containing pillow lavas and sheeted dikes as well as varitextured, foliated and layered gabbros resting on a relatively thin MOHO transition zone, was recalculated to approximately 6km. Here we present our data focusing on the petrological and geochemical logs obtained. Samples from the layered gabbro sequence show modal compositions of ~50 vol% plagioclase, ~40 vol% clinopyroxene and ~10 vol% olivine in average. The samples from the foliated gabbro sequence display a slightly higher amount of plagioclase. In very few samples up to 20 vol% of orthopyroxene is present. The layered gabbro sequence display Mg# 71-82 for olivine, Mg# 75-83 for clinopyroxene and An% in plagioclase of 71-93 mol%. The foliated gabbro sequence display Mg# 67-79 for olivine, Mg# 76-85 for clinopyroxene and An% in plagioclase of 58-85 mol%. The varitextured gabbro sequence display Mg# 74-80 for clinopyroxene and An% 59-86 in plagioclase mol%. The generally evolving trends in mineral major element composition from bottom to top of the profile are also observed for bulk rock major and trace element data. The average Sr87/Sr86 ratio is 0.7033 ± 0.0002 for the entire foliated and layered gabbro with significantly higher values for samples from fault zones cutting the gabbros at all crustal level which here are interpreted as possible hydrothermal pathways for cooling of the deep crust. We calculated the Wadi Gideah bulk crust composition and modeled possible fractionation paths, implying significant crystallization in the deep crust.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircons are often considered the panacea of provenance analysis but are often limited to inquiry based solely on the presence or absence of populations and thus restricted to qualitative comparisons. However, if one broad age spectrum source dominates a detrital dataset other sources may be obscured. We present a method for removing a broad age spectrum source through a process of randomly drawing grains from the dominant source, pairing them with sample grains and removing matched aged grains. This results in a residual population representing all remaining unassociated ages, which can then be compared to other potential sources using PDP crossplot and likeness comparisons. The sources best matching our post-removal sample are resampled in varying proportions, with the dominant, broad age spectrum source, to recreate the pre-subtraction sample by maximizing the population comparison tests.\nWe test our method with a synthetic dataset of 18, 10,000-grain 'sandstone' populations created from 6 easily differentiable sources and 1 complex source representing the dominant, broad age spectrum source. Synthetic detrital zircon age populations are created by randomly selecting from each of the synthetic populations. This method was able to consistently determine the correct sources and their mixing proportions to within ±10% of the original artificial sandstone proportions. Covariance between the two comparison tests also shows improvement relative to their pre-removal counterparts. Previously published detrital zircon age data from modern sediment samples of the Yangtze River (He et al., 2013) show a dominance of ages commonly attributed to the Triassic Songpan Ganze Terrane, which has a broad age spectrum. We applied our method to these Yangtze age populations in conjunction with 35 potential sources units compiled and consolidated from the literature. Applying this technique to modern Chinese sediments identifies previously unknown contributing sources and their mixing proportions, which can significantly increase our ability to examine spatial and temporal changes and patterns often sought in provenance studies.",

            "abstract": "We combine geophysical data, field-geological mapping and lab measurements to study the Carboneras fault zone (CFZ) in SE Spain. The CFZ is part of the Trans-Alborán Shear Zone which constitutes part of the diffuse plate boundary between Africa and Iberia. The CFZ is inferred to behave as a stretching transform fault with∼40 km left-lateral offset. It was active principally between 12 – 6 Ma BP, and has been exhumed from ca. 1 - 2 km depth. The relatively recent movement history and the semi-arid terrain lead to excellent exposure.The phyllosilicate-rich fault gougeis excellently preserved. In 2010 we conducted a controlled source seismic experiment at the CFZ in which explosive sources in boreholes (two groups of 3 explosions) were placed in two strands of the fault zone. The signals were observed with dense linear seismic arrays crossing the CFZ at 3.5km and 8.3km distance, respectively. The recordings show clear high-energy P-phases at receivers and from sources located at or near the fault zone. We interpret these phases as P-waves trapped in the low-velocity layer (waveguide) formed by the damage zone of the fault(s). With waveform modeling (using an analytical solution assuming a straight waveguide embedded in two quarter spaces and a line source at depth) we derive basic models well-explaining the observations. Lab-measurements of the different rocks constrain the possible models. Additionally, we employed extensive three-dimensional finite-difference (3D-FD) modeling with more realistic (curved and anastomosing) waveguide geometries. It seems that the studied segments of the CFZ form effective waveguides for seismic waves with connectivity over several kilometers. The derived seismic models together with lab measurements of the seismic velocities indicate that the average fault zone core widths are in the order of 15 to 25m which is in good agreement with surface geological mapping.",

            "abstract": "Because of rare collisions, the motion of light species (H, H2) in the planetary exospheres is essentially determined by the external forces: the gravitation from the planet and the radiation pressure, ... Currently, the only analytical model used to model exospheric neutral density profiles is the well-known Chamberlain model which takes into account only the gravity. In this work and in the same way as Chamberlain, we solve rigorously and analytically, based on the Hamiltonian mechanics and Liouville theorem, the additional effect of the radiation pressure in particular for hydrogen (the model works for any species sensitive to the radiation pressure) on the structure of the exosphere and on the density profiles of ballistic particles. This approach was initially developed by Bishop and Chamberlain (1989) only in the Sun-planet direction. We extend it here to the whole exosphere with a 2D model. Also, we determine analytically the escape flux on the dayside at SZA=0, which can be compared with the Jeans’ escape flux. We thus show that the radiation pressure induces :\nstrong density asymmetries at high altitudes in the planetary exospheres, leading to the phenomenon of geotail at Earth for example\nthe natural existence of an external limit (or exopause) for the exosphere, whose location is analytically determined\nan increase of the exospheric densities compared with Chamberlain profiles without radiation pressure (e.g. up to +150% at 5 Martian radius)\na significant increase of the thermal escape flux (up to 30/35% for Earth/Mars today), until a «blow-off » regime with a constant escape flux for an extreme radiation pressure. The influence of the radiation pressure on the escape flux may thus bring conditions on the size of primary atmospheres, because of a strong radiation pressure in the Sun's young years.\nFinally, we show that this model may be applied to exoplanets, in particular to the hot Jupiters that are also subject to additional effects: centrifugal force and stellar gravity. We show the influence of the radiation pressure on the equipotentials of the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem. We also demonstrate that the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is actually in a blow-off regime induced by the radiation pressure, which allows us to propose an alternative scenario for the evolution of its atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "In SW Yukon–SE Alaska, the present-day Pacific–North America relative motion is highly oblique to the main plate boundary, resulting in strong strain-partitioning tectonics that link the Aleutian subduction to the west to Queen Charlotte transform to the south. This transition region is also the site of present-day orogeny and accretion of the Yakutat Terrane to the Northern Cordillera.\nMultiple datasets (GPS, geomorphology, seismicity) are integrated to characterize and quantify strain patterns, with particular emphasis on strain partitioning between strike-slip and shortening deformation. New GPS data straddling the main faults (Denali, Totschunda, Fairweather) indicate that, south of the collision corner, 95% of the Pacific-North America strike-slip motion is accommodated on the plate-boundary Fairweather Fault, leaving near-zero motion on the Denali Fault only ~100 km inboard. In contrast, the fault-perpendicular component is strongly distributed between shortening offshore, in the orogen, and inland outward motion.\nIn the region of highest convergence obliquity, GPS data show a diffuse indentor-like deformation, with strong along-strike variations of the main fault slip rates. Preliminary results of a regional geomorphology study give further information about the Denali Fault, where previous data suggest a velocity decrease from 8 mm/yr (Matmon et al.,2006) to 4 mm/yr (Seitz et al., 2010). A high resolution DEM processed from Pleiades satellite imagery highlights a significant vertical component on the Denali Fault and very little to no strike-slip movement in its southern part. Metric-scale displacements are measured along the “inactive” part of the fault showing recent vertical deformation since the Last Glacial Maximum (~20 kyrs ago). In contrast, significant dextral offsets on post-LGM structures are measured on the southern Totschunda Fault. Ongoing datation of geomorphological markers (Be10, OSL) will give us new slip-rate estimates along the southern part of the main transpressional faults (Denali, Totschunda). Our preliminary results suggest that, both south and north of the collision front, the lithospheric scale Denali Fault does not show any significant strike slip movement and that deformation is mostly accommodated along the Fairweather and Totschunda Faults.",

Recently more attentions have been paid on the mechanisms how the freshwater contribute to the high productivity and species diversity of the coastal ecosystems. In the present study, results from physical and biological surveys conducted at four locations (Yuza, Otsuchi, Obama and Beppu) in Japan in order to examine effects of river water and submarine groundwater on productivity and species diversity of fishery resources are introduced. Fish sampling was conducted by the use of small seine net (2 x 1 mm, 2 mm mesh). Invertebrates (crustaceans and polychaetes, as prey for the fishes) were collected with a plankton net (0.3 x 0.4 m, 1 mm mesh) and a core sampler (10 x 10 cm circular cylinder). In addition, underwater camera recording was conducted by four digital cameras (1 min interval, for 3 hours) to analyze abundance and species composition of fishes around each sampling site. Relationships between physical parameters (water temperature, salinity and Rn concentration) and biological parameters (abundance, biomass and species diversity of fish, crustaceans and polychaetes) were investigated. Significant increase in abundance and number of species of fishes and some invertebrate species were observed in three of the four locations, indication submarine groundwater promote biological production and species diversity in coastal ecosystems. The mechanisms how the freshwater input from the land contributes to the high productivity and species diversity in the coastal ecosystems will be examined through wood web analysis (e.g. stomach contents and stable isotopes) in the ongoing study. Possible effects of climatic changes (including the global warming) through spatio-temporal variability in submarine groundwater discharge on the productivity and species diversity in coastal ecosystems are predicted based on the species interactions and optimum temperature for each species.",

Recent in situ data inside a meddy as well as high resolution PE simulations reveal the formation of highly density-compensated layers in temperature and salinity at the periphery of the vortex core. Passive tracer experiments suggest that the vertical variance cascade is triggered by the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity field resulting in the generation of thin layers. The time evolution of this process down to scales of O(10m) is quantified and a simple scaling is proposed and shown to describe precisely the thinning down of the layers as a function of the initial azimuthal tracer gradients and the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity. Non-linear QG simulations were performed and analysed and a step-by-step interpretation of these results on the evolution of layering is proposed in the context of tracer stirring.",

The distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) coincides with that of the sediment grain size, suggesting the hydrodynamic constraints on the accumulation of SOM. There existed a significant presence of terrigenous-derived n-alkanes in the central YS mud deposits inferring from these molecular parameters and PCA identification, suggesting the dominant role of the hydrodynamic forcing on the selective dispersal and preferential accumulation of the fluvial terrigenous OM in the YS. The central mud deposits of the YS are the sinks of the long-distance transported Yellow River-derived sediments and its associated terrigenous OM; For the coastal ECS, the presence of bacteria/algae-derived organic matter (OM) and agriculture soil-derived OM could be responsible for the lower C/N and elevated δ13C values. There could be an effectively preferential dispersal of land-based SOM, while with potential subsequent degradation induced by the local addition of marine-derived OM. The significant relationships between perylene and the terrigenous organic matter (OM) proxies could suggest a combination of the predepositional fluvial input of perylene and in situ formation from its precursors with land-derived OM origins for its appearance in the coastal ECS. The deposition flux of perylene could be likely served as a geochemical imprint to assess the river input influence on the sedimentary environment of the coastal ECS.",

            "abstract": "Where deformation is accommodated by complex arrays of interacting faults, individual fault strands often show fluctuating levels of activity through time with intervals of high, or low, slip rate corresponding to earthquake clusters or quiescence, respectively. Thus earthquakes may occur on structures other than those defined as active based on historical events and paleoseismic records, confounding attempts to map seismic hazard with such datasets. A major challenge is to identify which faults are ahead of their long-term slip rate, which faults are behind their long term rate but still active, and which faults are no longer active. We show that cosmogenic 36Cl depth profiles measured systematically along the fault plane in trenches excavated below the base of bedrock scarps as well as along the exhumed scarp formed by extensional fault slip can be used to estimate both the average Holocene slip rate and the elapsed time since the last earthquake. Specifically, the increase in 36Cl concentration with height immediately above and below the ground surface at the scarp base reveals whether the elapsed time is anomalously long (or short) compared to the expected mean earthquake recurrence. For an area of active extension in Italy, we demonstrate that independent constraints on Holocene slip rates and elapsed times of historical earthquakes show a close correspondence with estimates derived from the 36Cl profiles. However, some faults slipped at rates higher than their Holocene-averaged rate from ~5 ka to the Middle Ages, indicating greater strain accumulation on the SW flank of the central Apennines in a zone that is now quiescent. The historical catalogue shows that, since the earthquake of 1349 A.D., activity has been concentrated in a 50km wide zone of faults further to the NE. In contrast, when viewed over the whole Holocene, strain is symmetrically distributed across the whole array. When taken together, along with documented earthquake shaking since Roman times, these data suggest that the locus of strain accumulation has migrated from one crustal scale fault system to another over a distance of several 10’s of km over a time scale of several thousand years and that deformation in this area is more variable in both space and time than the geodetically-determined interseismic strain accumulation would predict.",

Magnetostatic interactions are calculated in real space, allowing simulations to be performed for particle ensembles with arbitrary geometry. For weakly interacting uniaxial particles, the equilibrium magnetization at each field step is obtained by direct solution of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, assuming a quasi-static distribution of interaction fields. For all other cases, the equilibrium magnetization is calculated using an approximate iterated solution to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Multithreading is employed to allow multiple curves to be computed simultaneously, enabling FORC diagrams to be simulated in reasonable time using a standard desktop computer. Statistical averaging and post processing lead to simulated FORC diagrams that are comparable to their experimental counterparts. The method is applied to several geometries of relevance to rock and environmental magnetism, including densely packed random clusters and partially collapsed chains. The method forms the basis of FORCulator, a freely available software tool with graphical user interface that will enable FORC simulations to become a routine part of rock magnetic studies.",

            "abstract": "Direct observations of coseismic fault displacement and rupture-related features are essential to understand seismic cycles, to quantify seismic hazard, and to constrain rupture dynamics. They are also needed to trace the paleoseismic history of active faults. Such observations in submarine environments are practically absent, but critical to assess associated tsunami hazard. The ODEMAR cruise studied a ~10 km section of the Roseau Fault (RF) off Les Saintes Islands (Guadeloupe, French Lesser Antilles), a normal fault that generated a Mw 6.3 earthquake in 2004 that triggered a tsunami (<3.5 m of run-up). Microbathymetric data and video observations conducted with the autonomous underwater vehicle ABYSS (GEOMAR) and the remotely operated vehicle VICTOR (IFREMER) allow us to document recent fault-related deformation features.\nFirst, the RF hangingwall shows an indurated and ubiquitous rippled sediment layer, locally covered by recent, unconsolidated sediments reworked by currents. Seafloor photomosaics show the indurated layer disrupted by extensional cracks (up to few m long, several 10s of cm wide, ~30 cm deep) along >1 km and by the RF scarp base, that are certainly very young as they are not covered by unconsolidated sediments.\nSecond, video imagery reveals well-preserved, subvertical and polished fault planes exposed at the RF scarp base. Videomosacing and video derived 3D terrain models of a fault outcrop (~12 m long, ~5 m high) reveal on the fault plane a thin, continuous line of unconsolidated sediment sub-parallel to and 10s' of cm above the fault/sediment contact. The line represents the paleo-fault/sediment contact prior to a very recent displacement event, as strong currents in the area would otherwise have washed out the sediment. The fault surface above this line is rougher than that below it.\nBased on the apparent young age of these features, and given the recurrence time of seismic events along the RF (hundreds to a few thousands of years for Mw 6 earthquakes), we attribute them to the 2004 Saintes event. High-resolution bathymetry, videomosaicing, and 3D terrain models thus provide critical constraints on coseismic deformation: We document the rupture of >1.5 km of the RF, and we quantify a coseismic vertical displacement of at least 0.8 m, constraining model-derived estimates of fault displacement.",

This allows to reach a significantly improved along track resolution with respect to traditional pulse-width limited altimeters.\nCryoSat is the first altimetry mission operating in SAR mode and continuous improvement in the Level1 Instrument Processing Facility (IPF1) are being identified, tested and validated in order to improve the quality of the Level1b products.\nTowards the release of the BaselineC of the CryoSat Level1b SAR/SARin products, that is expected at the end of 2014, several improvements have been identified:\na datation bias of about -0.5195 ms will be corrected\na range bias of about 0.6730 m will be corrected\nThe range window size will be doubled with respect to BaselineB, so that the in Level1b products the waveforms will be doubled too\nImproved processing for 1Hz echoes to have sharper waveforms\nSurface sample stack weighting to filter out the single look echoes acquired at highest look angle, that results in a sharpening of the 20Hz waveforms\nAdditional auxiliary information related to the mispointing angles of the instrument as well as to the stacks of single look echoes will be added\nThis poster details the main quality improvements that are foreseen to be included in the CryoSat Level1b SAR/SARin products in BaselineC.",

            "abstract": "Changes to glacier fronts and ice shelves and glacier acceleration are well documented, but there are almost no data on mass changes for the more than 400 glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. Satellite data have been used to calculate change over the last 3 decades, but methods to quantify this over longer timescales have eluded researchers. However there is an archive of aerial photography dating back to the 1940s, this has been largely ignored due to the range of technical problems associated with deriving quantitative data from historic imagery and the lack of ground control data. This presentation demonstrates how advances in photogrammetric processing and capture of modern aerial photography has allowed this archive to be 'unlocked'.\nAccurate photogrammetric reconstruction from aerial photographs traditionally requires known ground control points acquired in the field; however, in remote and inaccessible areas, such as the Antarctic Peninsula, this is often impossible. A method for providing control for historic photos without fieldwork, by linking them to a newly acquired, highly accurate photogrammetric model adjusted through direct kinematic GPS positioning of the camera has been applied to a number of glaciers across the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThis presentation will outline the photogrammetric workflow and associated errors to highlight the suitability of this technique and demonstrate the data that can be obtained. Accurate measurements of surface elevation change on glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula over a 70 year time span have enabled quantification of spatial and temporal patterns of change. The results show a general trend of glacier retreat, but with thinning of the glacier terminus marginally offset by accumulation in the upper areas of the glacier. The use of this technique opens up possibilities for ‘unlocking the archive’ in other remote glacial areas where historic aerial photography exists but the collection of ground control points is limited.",

            "abstract": "Turbidity currents, which occur at the continental margins and transport sediments along submarines canyons are particulate gravity currents made of poorly sorted particles. In such currents, the flow is to a large extent controlled by the grain size distribution of the particles at the source. Here we present the combined results of a box model and lock-exchange experiments of particulate gravity currents at small volumetric concentrations of particles (< 4%) flowing along a V-shaped valley, for which we looked at the grain size distributions along the deposit. The currents were made of 1) Silicon Carbide (SiC), 2) Glass Beads (GBs), 3) combined poorly sorted SiC/GBs, and 4) moderately sorted combined SiC/GBs. Experimental particles sizes were in the range 3-100 microns. We used 20 particle size classes to characterize the distributions. First we show that a box model that solves for the deposition of all the particle size classes, remarkably describes the speed of the currents, the mass deposited by the currents, and the material density of the deposit for those currents initially made of SiC and GBs. Last but not least, the box model also reconstructs the mass based size distributions along the deposits characterized by various fining. Yet, the reconstructed distributions differ with the shape of the particles. In the presence of only round GBs particles, the mass based size distributions given by the box compare extremely well with the experimental counterparts. In the presence of SiC, there is a systematic shift towards the smaller grain sizes of the mass based size distributions given by the box compared to the experimental ones. Several hypotheses to explain this shift are currently being investigated.

Pattern classification tools allow to handle efficiently compositional data of volcanic products, complying with their multivariate nature. In the framework of the European MED-SUV project, we explore the application of various data mining methods to volcanic products erupted at Mt. Etna, Italy. Considering 13 major and trace elements for each sample, groups with similar geochemical composition were identified. The set of samples analyzed covers the time span from 2006 to 2012, during which there were two major episodes of effusive activity (2006, 2008-2009) and 25 lava fountains (2011-12). Our approach allows a convenient visualization of the multi-component characteristics of magma in just a single picture, using a color code and cluster membership values. This result offers an important advantage with respect to classical analyses, which require many low-dimensional diagrams (78 possible combinations in conventional 2D graphs).The synoptic information provided by pattern classification easily allows us i) to identify trends of evolution with time even within each eruptive center, and ii) the immediate comparison of the compositional features with all products analyzed in the past.",

            "abstract": "It is evident that at scales of 102 to 10-2 m there is significant isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle that is not always reflected in primitive melts. The “Os isotopic gap”[1] is one such manifestation of this phenomenon but a similar offset exists between the Nd isotope composition of abyssal peridotites and the mid-ocean ridge basalts that they are inferred to have produced[2]. This study takes advantage of recent advances in the analysis of Nd isotopes as NdO+[3,4] which permit the precise analysis of single clinopyroxene grains (<1 mg mass; <5 ng Nd) from a continental harzburgitic xenolith from Kilbourne Hole, NM. Analyses of aggregates of clinopyroxenes from 5 Kilbourne Hole xenoliths reveal a wide range of 143Nd/144Nd (0.513011 ± 28 to 0.513615 ±19)[5]. This study demonstrates significant grain-to-grain isotopic heterogeneity at a scale of 10-2 m (143Nd/144Nd = 0.513089 ± 78 to 0.513364 ± 74) which (i) is equivalent to the range of values for Pacific MORB[6] and (ii) is more primitive than local basalts with an asthenospheric signature[7]. This suggests that small-scale refractory domains exist within the mantle which are either not sampled during partial melting or whose presence is obscured by the melting of higher volumes of more fusible material.\nRef:[1]Alard et al.

            "abstract": "The modern polar cryosphere reflects an extreme climate state with profound temperature gradients towards high-latitudes. It developed in association with stepwise Cenozoic cooling, beginning with ephemeral glaciations and the appearance of sea ice in the late middle Eocene. The polar ocean gateways played a pivotal role in changing the polar and global climate, along with declining greenhouse gas levels. The opening of the Drake Passage finalized the oceanographic isolation of Antarctica, some 40 Ma ago. The Arctic Ocean was an isolated basin until the early Miocene when rifting and subsequent sea-floor spreading started between Greenland and Svalbard, initiating the opening of the Fram Strait / Arctic-Atlantic Gateway (AAG). Although this gateway is known to be important in Earth’s past and modern climate, little is known about its Cenozoic development. However, the opening history and AAG’s consecutive widening and deepening must have had a strong impact on circulation and water mass exchange between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic.\nTo study the AAG’s complete history, ocean drilling at two primary sites and one alternate site located between 73°N and 78°N are proposed. These sites will provide unprecedented sedimentary records that will unveil (1) the history of shallow-water exchange between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic, and (2) the development of the AAG to a deep-water connection and its influence on the global climate system.\nThe specific overarching goals of our proposal are to study:\n• the influence of distinct tectonic events in the development of the AAG and the formation of deep water passage on the North Atlantic and Arctic paleoceanography, and\n• the role of the AAG in the climate transition from the Paleogene greenhouse to the Neogene icehouse for the long-term (~50 Ma) climate history of the northern North Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "The Balkans region that sits at the transition between stable Eurasia and highly straining Eastern Mediterranean, is a natural laboratory to study diffuse deformation of areas affected by continental collision. As in the Himalayan collision zone, it results in a widespread seismicity and underestimated seismic hazard (England & Jackson, 2011). Several Mw~6 shallow earthquakes occurred there in the last century producing large destructions and casualties. The completeness interval of the available historical seismicity catalogs is probably below the average recurrence of individual seismogenic structures, making them insufficient for accurate estimates of seismic hazard there. However, cGPS networks in the Balkans have been growing during the last few years mainly for civilian application, opening new opportunities to quantify the present-day rates of crustal deformation.\nHere, we processed all the currently available data acquired on these new networks using the Gipsy-Oasis software and combined them with previously published velocities. We use this dense velocity field together with tensor moments from RCMT and CMT to derive an homogeneous map of the current-day strain using the methodology of Haines & Holt (1993). We image the deformation resulting from the boundary conditions around the Balkans : (i) the NE motion of Adria-Apulia blocks, (ii) the rigid Eurasian and Black sea backstops, (iii) the hellenic subduction zone and NAF rapid SE motion.\nWe show that the «Adria-Apulia push» is nearly entirely accommodated by compression across the Dinarides with minor propagation in the Pannonian basin. On the other hand, East of 20°E, the entire peninsula is moving southward, probably driven by the hellenic subduction pull. The transition between the SW-NE compressive and the N-S extensive regimes roughly corresponds to the Scutari-Pec transform zone, also known to be a boundary between paleomagnetic domains. Therefore, we show that the clockwise rotation pattern imaged by Perouse et al. (2012) in northern Greece extends up to northern Serbia (46°N), involving the whole Balkans. Finally, we calculate that the N-S extension does not account for the whole SW-NE compression over the Dinarides and that significant strain is stored over the Balkans, probably on multiple active structures that remain to be identified.",

            "abstract": "The Sahel is one of the regions in the world which has experienced the strongest climatic changes in the past decades. In a context of high population growth and mainly agriculture-based economies and livelihoods, these fluctuations can cause serious societal problems. Understanding past and predicting future climatic changes and their implications on natural and cultivated ecosystems are hence primordial. Modelling efforts in the fields of hydrology and ecohydrology have already been undertaken, but are hindered by data availability as soon as the multi-decadal time scale is targeted. Indeed, in addition to being scarce, climatic data are often discontinuous in time, limiting the use of many modelling tools.\nIn this study we produced a continuous and consistent data set at Niamey, Niger (13.5° N, 2.1° E) from 1950 to 2012 at different temporal scales (daily, 3-h and 30-min) that can be used as inputs in most LSM-type, vegetation and hydrological models. A stochastic component was introduced to reflect the uncertainty on the determination of missing data. Variables under study were: rainfall, air temperature, specific humidity, air pressure, wind speed, cloud cover, clear-sky longwave and shortwave radiation. Missing data were filled through regression methods, artificial neural networks, or by randomly selecting the missing variables from data classes presenting similar properties.\nThe datasets showed an increase in temperature of over 1°C since the 1950s. They also maintained the diurnal and seasonal cycles for all variables, thus verifying their internal coherence. Uncertainty at the sub-daily scale did not propagate at longer time-scales for the climatic data. Finally, trends in the seasonal and diurnal cycle of main variables were analyzed and were found coherent with published data. As an illustration of a possible use of this dataset, variations in the water and energy budgets for 1950-2012 for a major ecosystem in the region were simulated using a detailed LSM/SVAT model (SiSPAT). This dataset could be used by the community to better understand and predict land-surface-atmosphere interactions in Central Sahel, including hydrological ones, such as historical changes in yield, growth of natural vegetation, changes in the water cycle and as a high-quality baseline for climate change impacts studies.",

            "abstract": "The Rocknest eolian drift sediments were pyrolyzed in the Science Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Curiosity rover, yielding a small, discrete peak of C1-C3 volatiles, which were detected by direct mass spectrometry. This peak was observed to have a maximum intensity at ~820°C in all four evolved gas analysis (EGA) experiments of the scooped and sieved (to ≤ 150 mm) Rocknest sediment, though it is strongest in the second and third analyses. It was not observed in any blanks or subsequent samples of drilled rocks. Estimates of the total reduced carbon concentration are 16 ± 4 ppm carbon by weight in the sample. Evolved gas analysis does not support definitive identification of trace molecules in gas mixtures, however the masses that define the observed peak are consistent with primarily CO2 (oxidized carbon phase; 9 ± 2 ppmw carbon ) and CO, with 1-2 orders of magnitude less C1-3 hydrocarbons. The observed mass composition and temperature of evolution for the Rocknest-820°C peak are suggestive of reduced carbon in a refractory state within the sample and inconsistent with reaction products that one might expect from terrestrial organic materials that are part of SAM’s background. These carbon volatiles are most likely released from inclusions or decrepitating minerals and this entrapment may be responsible for their preservation after significant exposure to ionizing radiation and mechanical weathering. Detection of these volatiles indicates reduced carbon phases are present in some Martian surface sediment. Carbon concentrations for Rocknest are within the range reported for magmatic carbon in Martian meteorites and the composition is comparable to volatiles released from terrestrial basaltic glasses. The Rocknest drift deposit is considered representative of the global dust on Mars. The very-high-temperature volatile release from Rocknest implies a possible global distribution of reduced carbon on the Martian surface.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) supported the research described here.",

            "abstract": "Submarine canyons are instrumental in transporting sediment from coastal regions to deep-sea fans. Mean grain size, distribution, and sorting have been used to characterize these deposits, but they provide little information on where sediment transport was initiated or the delivery processes involved. Fortunately, the entrained biological constituents have unique environmental signatures that are more precise proxies for source areas than are mineral grains alone. They may identify a single biofacies deposit (SBD) resulting from local sediment transport such as storm waves, peak river discharge, breaking of internal waves, canyon wall sloughing, or hemipelagic deposition, or a displaced, multiple biofacies deposit (MBD) containing several biofacies where sediment is transported from one biofacies to another, is caught behind a slump that acts as a dam, remains there long enough for the local fauna to become established, and then this combined assemblage is transported further downslope when the dam breaks. Multiple episodes of this “staged” storage-and-release process occur sequentially so as to move the sediment progressively down the canyon. Rarely, exceptionally large triggers such as earthquakes, intense storm disturbances, and catastrophic failure of canyon walls result in full canyon flushing events, entraining numerous biofacies during a single rapid descent. These events can be differentiated in recent deposits by the presence of living specimens representing distinct biofacies or in historic records by dating individual biofacies within a turbidite.\nA 19,000 year record from the Ascension-Monterey Canyon system (core S3-15G, 36°23.53'N, 123°20.52'W; 3491 m) captured hemipelagic mud interspersed with turbiditic sand and silt transported to lower bathyal depths. The relative abundance of displaced benthic foraminifera was found to correlate positively with grain size (75% in cross-bedded turbiditic sands, 39% in laminated turbiditic sands, and 15% in turbiditic muds) and the 65 MBDs recovered originated from the estuarine/inner shelf to the upper middle slope. Sediment bypassing was evident and possibly full canyon flushing as well. Identifying allochthonous biological sediment constituents is a powerful tool in the investigation of sediment transport in submarine canyons.",

            "abstract": "The abundance of redox active Fe minerals has the potential to alter the storage and loss of C, contribute to gaseous N emissions, and control P retention in upland tropical forest soils. High concentrations of short-range order Fe minerals led to Fe(II) production rates of 26-206 µg g d-1 under short-term low redox conditions (Chacón et al. 2006, Liptzin and Silver 2009, Dubinsky et al. 2010). Potential C mineralization from Fe(II) reduction was 34-263 g CO2-C m-2 y-1, C losses equivalent to approximately 10-60 % of annual litterfall production in this forest. Decreased acidity during Fe reduction can destabilize soil aggregates and lead to C losses. Iron is rapidly reoxidized during aerobic periods, which can subsequently lead to C stabilization via complexation reactions. Fe oxidation can also stimulate C losses via pH-driven dissolved organic C production and directly via Fenton reactions. In laboratory experiments, rates of CO2 production were strongly linearly correlated with Fe(II) loss under aerobic conditions, increasing by 0.51 ± 0.02 µg CO2-C g soil h-1 respired for each mg of Fe(II) g-1 soil oxidized or sorbed (Hall and Silver 2013). Iron oxidation has also been linked to dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ leading to N retention in ecosystems. Fe(III) reduction coupled with NH4+ oxidation (Feammox) can lead to N losses as dinitrogen gas (N2) or nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Estimates suggest that Feammox resulted in gaseous N losses of 1-4 kg N ha-1 y-1 (Yang et al. 2012), rates equivalent to total denitrification in this forest. Oxidized Fe can strongly bind P decreasing it’s availability to plant roots. While this is commonly cited as a potential limitation to net primary production in tropical forests, it also helps to retain P in ecosystems with high rainfall and potential leaching losses. Microbial biomass P availability increased significantly with Fe(II) production, suggesting the P mobilized during Fe(II) reduction was rapidly immobilized into biological pools (Liptzin and Silver 2009). Data suggest that Fe-redox cycling may decrease P limitation to NPP, and help maintain forest nutrient stocks. In summary, our results highlight the biogeochemical significance of Fe cycling in upland soils environments and its important role in the dynamics of humid tropical forests.",

            "abstract": "Rosetta’s module Philae will soon land on 67P CG nucleus, giving unprecedented insight about a comet nucleus, its composition and interior. The CONSERT instrument is one of the 20 scientific instruments of the mission. It’s a bistatic two-modules radar, one on the orbiter, one on the lander. They generate EM waves that are transmitted through the nucleus. The signal is therefore delayed and attenuated by the nucleus materials and possible inhomogeneities. An accurate measurement and processing of these signals, repeated along the orbit, will allow us to perform a tomography, and for the first time, map the dielectric properties of a comet nucleus internal structures .\nOur approach for the resolution of this inverse problem is to use a custom built software called SIMSERT, which simulates the end-to-end experiment, using a ray-tracing algorithm. This tool is the key to prepare CONSERT operation and perform signal analysis. Given a comet shape and a landing site, we have conducted simulations to understand, quantify and get rid of the biases due to the discretization of the shape model.\nThe first inversion using the comet shape model given by OSIRIS and NavCam teams , will assume a propagation in an homogeneous medium. The first goal is to identify and correct artefacts due to the surface interface. The second goal is to evaluate the coherency of the different permittivity estimations given by inverting the latter model on the signal measured at different positions along the orbit. Then it is likely that, based on the first investigations, more sophisticated models (rubble pile, strata) and inversions will be required. A comparative approach between the simulated data and the CONSERT data, will lead to permittivity maps of the nucleus, that are coherent with the observation, with a certain probability. These maps, the first of this type, will provide unprecedented information about the internal structure, the accretion history and the nucleus time evolution.",

            "abstract": "A national system of field inventory plots is the primary data source for the annual assessment of US forest carbon (C) stocks and stock-change to meet reporting requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The inventory data and their role in national carbon reporting continue to evolve. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service is charged with conducting the field inventory of US forest C. The FIA program employs remotely sensed imagery to define forest and nonforest plots which are systematically distributed approximately every 2,428 ha across the conterminous US. More than 125,000 plots in the current field inventory have at least one forested condition where field crews measure tree- and site-level attributes (e.g., diameter and tree height) at regular temporal intervals. A subset of forested plots is measured for additional variables related to forest non-tree C pools (e.g., downed woody materials, understory vegetation, and soils). The FIA program does not directly measure forest C stocks. Instead, a combination of empirically derived C estimates (e.g., standing live and dead trees) and models (e.g., understory C stocks related to stand age and forest type) are used to estimate forest C stocks. A series of recent refinements in FIA estimation procedures have sought to reduce the uncertainty associated with the national C inventory by: 1) refining forest floor C estimates with in situ data, 2) updating the live belowground and understory C pools modeling approaches, 3) refining objective delineations between woodland and forest land uses, and 4) revising managed land delineations. The results of these studies in the context of forest C accounting and future refinements are discussed in the context of UNFCCC reporting.",

            "abstract": "Normal activity at Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy) can be broadly divided into (1) puffing, where small amounts of gas are emitted without pyroclasts at a rate of ~1 per second; and (2) \"normal\" explosions, where gas and pyroclast mixtures are expelled up to several hundred meters high (at rates of 1-10 events per hour).\nIn May 2014, we monitored Stromboli's active vents with high speed visible-light and thermal infrared cameras. At vents in the SW, central and NE craters, puffing was clearly visible, emitting hot gas plumes lasting less than 0.2 s and sometimes spaced by less than 0.1 s, causing frequent event overlap. The initial ascent velocity of the gas was ~10 m/s, typical of a jet phase produced by burst of a slightly overpressurized bubble. The variability of the emission point within a vent suggested that these bubbles were smaller than the vent radius. The size of individual puffs estimated from the radiant energy of the plume was variable, but limited by an upper bound depending on the vent characteristics.\nMeanwhile, \"normal\" explosions occurred at intervals of a few minutes. The high ejection velocity of the pyroclasts (up to 400 m/s) and the duration of the explosions (5-30 s) suggested that explosions came from large and highly pressurized slugs arriving at the \"free surface\".\nExplosion onsets were well defined by the emission of the first, fast, pyroclasts. However, in most cases, precursory gas was recorded up to 10 s before pyroclast release. The absence of pyroclasts and the initial ascent velocity of gas indicated that these emissions corresponded to puffing-like activity. On the other hand, their size were greater than regular puffs (sometimes by more than one order of magnitude) and frequently increased with time. This suggested that these precursory puffs were strongly influenced by the rising slug about to burst.\nSimilarly, after the last pyroclast ejection, large and low-velocity gas release events were occasionally observed, and interpreted as a coda due to the magma disturbance generated by the explosion. Precursors and coda can be used to estimate the changes in the pressure field produced by the rise and burst of slugs.",

Previous studies have attempted to reconcile this apparent disconnect between the satellite and surface data by hypothesizing various sources of aerosol aloft.

We use the aircraft observations to examine the consistency between the satellite and surface aerosol data. We quantify the contributions of anthropogenic, biogenic, and open fire sources to the different aerosol species, and examine relationships between species and their precursors as constraints on emissions and chemistry.

            "abstract": "We report the results of simple laboratory experiments aimed at mimicking the generation, migration, and expulsion process of oil or gas from soft clayey sediments, triggered by thermal decomposition of organic matter. In previously published work, we showed that the injection of fluids into a soft sediment layer confined within a quasi-2D Hele-Shaw cell led to the transition from a viscous fingering invasion regime to a viscoelastic fracturing regime. The transition is controlled by the ratio of the characteristic times for the invasion process and for the structural relaxation in the sediment, respectively (Deborah number). Here we show that expulsion is a discontinuous quasi-periodic process, driven by the elastic energy stored in the embedding layers.\nWe report also about two sets of experiments aimed at understanding the conditions in which fluid generation from multiple sources can generate a highly connected network of fractures for expulsion. In a first set of experiments, a Hele-Shaw cell with multiple injection points and multiple outlets was used. It is shown that, due to attractive elastic interactions between cracks, a network spontaneously forms as soon as invasion proceeds in the viscoelastic regime. On the contrary, no network of migration paths is forming in the viscous fingering regime, due to the effective repulsion of the fluid channels.\nIn the second set of analog experiments, we used a thermostated mini-Hele-Shaw cell, the gap of which was filled with a strong clay mud in which microcrystals of reactive organic matter (azoisobutyronitrile, AIBN) are dispersed, or with a mud prepared with clay particles on which the organic matter was pre-impregnated. AIBN decomposes around 70°C, releasing nitrogen gas. It was again observed that, depending on the viscoelastic properties of the clay matrix, gas evolution occurs either by formation and coalescence of bubbles, or by formation of a percolating network of fractures. The length of the fracture network is initially linearly related to the Total (reactive) Organic Matter content. The expulsion process is remarkably effective in the fracturing regime (close to 100 percent), even at vey low TOC (below 0.5 percent). The relevance of these experiments for oil and gas migration in natural conditions will be discussed.",

We analyze and compare the horizontal and vertical distribution of dissolved methane within these lakes during different time periods: the stratified period in summer, the autumn overturn, the winter mixing period, and the period from spring to summer stratification. The horizontal distributions of dissolved methane within the lakes suggest that the relation between surface area and maximum water-depth is a key factor determining the heterogeneity of methane concentrations in the surface water. During most of the year littoral zones are the main source of the methane that is emitted to the atmosphere except for the overturn periods. The vertical distributions of temperature and dissolved oxygen within the different seasons affect the vertical distribution of dissolved methane and thus the methane budget within lakes. Anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and the intense mixing during overturn periods are key factors for the overall annual methane emissions from lakes.",

            "abstract": "To assess historical loads of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and suspended sediment (SS) from the non-tidal Chesapeake Bay watershed (NTCBW), we have analyzed long-term seasonal trends of flow-normalized loads at the fall-line of nine major tributaries that account for over 90% of NTCBW streamflow. Seasonal comparisons revealed that (1) nutrient and sediment loads have been generally highest in Jan-Mar and lowest in Jul-Sep, and (2) decadal-scale trends have generally followed similar patterns in all seasons, with some important exceptions. Generally, total N load from NTCBW has dropped since the late 1980s, but particulate nutrients and SS have risen since the mid-1990s. The majority of this rise was from the Susquehanna River and relates to diminished trapping of SS during extreme events at Conowingo Reservoir. Substantial rising trends in SS were also observed, however, in the other rivers. Moreover, the summed magnitudes of rise in particulate P loading in other tributaries are of similar magnitude as those for the Susquehanna. Dissolved nutrient loadings have dropped in the upland (Piedmont-and-above) rivers, but dissolved nutrients loadings have risen in two small rivers that are within the Coastal Plain and affected by lagged groundwater input. These two rivers may be most representative of Coastal Plain watersheds that feed some major tidally influenced regions that are not otherwise accounted by this study. Finally, analysis of fractional contributions revealed that the seven upland rivers yielded surprisingly steady fractions of N, suggesting consistency of N input and N-modulation across the watershed. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of integrated and comparative evaluations of historical data and highlights the importance of maintaining long-term water-quality monitoring at multiple watershed locations.",

The high hydroxyl (OH) reactivity of these BVOCs causes much of the initial chemistry to occur near the forest. Some OH measurements in forests are much greater than calculated with models, leading to close examination of the BVOC oxidation mechanisms and the possibility of significant OH recycling. The 2013 Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) provides a rigorous test of the BVOC oxidation mechanisms and OH recycling with its extensive measurement suite that was positioned in an Alabama forest for six weeks. OH measurements made with the Ground-based Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS) are compared to photochemical box models constrained with other simultaneous measurements in order to test the understanding of this forest photochemistry. In this work, we use a global sensitivity analysis (Random Sampling – High Dimensional Model Representation) to examine the sensitivity of the differences between the modeled and measured OH to the model mechanism and inputs. In this presentation, we will discuss the model reactions and inputs that have the most influence on the modeled OH and its difference with measured OH and will provide recommendations for reducing model and measurement uncertainty.",

The aim was to study the processes that influence the Tropical Tropopause layer (TTL), the major route for troposphere to stratosphere transport. The field campaign was based mainly in Guam (13.5oN, 144.8oE) and had three components: the ATTREX project organized by NASA and based around the Global Hawk; the NCAR-led CONTRAST campaign based around the Gulfstream V (HIAPER) aircraft; and CAST with the NERC FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft. Together, the three aircraft were able to make detailed measurements of atmospheric structure and composition from the ocean surface to 20 km. The BAe-146 made a total of 25 flights between 1 oS-14 oN and 130 – 155 oE. The 146 was used to sample at low altitudes (below 8 km) with much of the time spent in or close to the marine boundary layer. This strategy meant that the region of main inflow into the strong convection was sampled thoroughly. Concentrations of the following chemicals were measured in situ: CO, O3, NO2, NO, CO2, CH4, N2O, H2O, a range of halocarbons including CH2Br2, CHBr3 and CH3I; and reactive halogen species including BrO, BrCl, HOBr and IO. The CAST team also made ground-based measurements at the ARM site on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea during February 2014. Ozonesondes were deployed daily, and measurements of ozone, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O and halocarbons were made at the ground. Halocarbon measurements were also made at other West Pacific sites.",

            "abstract": "Mass anomalies in the Earth's mantle associated with thermal and compositional heterogeneities or with deflected boundaries between layers of different density produce stresses, which initiate mantle convection, plumes, subduction and deformations of the lithosphere. In particularly, the upper mantle plays a key role in controlling surface tectonics. Therefore, knowledge of density heterogeneity of the upper mantle is principal for understanding its dynamics and ongoing tectonic processes. This is particularly important for a complicated region such as Eurasia, where nearly all types of tectonic settings are present. There exist three main problems in construction of 3-D density models of the upper mantle. First, it is necessary to remove before hand the effect of the crust, which substantially masks the upper mantle gravity field. Second, the gravity effects of thermal and compositional density variations should be separated. And finally, the inverse gravity problem is usually underdetermined. In the present study we attempt to create a density model of the upper mantle based on improved interpretation methods and updated initial data sets. The impact of the crust to the observed gravity is estimated based on a new crustal model (Stolk et al., 2013). After removing this effect, we estimate the residual mantle anomalies of the gravity field. In the same way we estimate the residual topography, which is the second principal constraint used in the inversion. The impact of the mantle below 350 km is determined and removed based on recent mantle flow models. 3D density model of the lithosphere and upper mantle is constructed in an iterative inversion with tomography data. Contrary to most of previous studies, the thermal and compositional models are self-consistent. Many principal features of the compositional variations are not resolved by seismic tomography. The obtained density and thermal models can be used to model ongoing tectonic processes. Stolk W., Kaban M.K., Beekman F., Tesauro M., Mooney W.D., Cloetingh S. (2013).

            "abstract": "A test site for CO2 geological storage is situated in Hontomín (Spain) with a reservoir rock that is mainly composed of limestone. During and after CO2 injection, the resulting CO2-rich acid brine gives rise to the dissolution of carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) and gypsum (or anhydrite at depth) may precipitate since the reservoir brine contains sulfate. Experiments using columns filled with crushed limestone or dolostone were conducted under different P-pCO2 conditions (atmospheric: 1-10-3.5 bar; subcritical: 10-10 bar; and supercritical: 150-34 bar), T (25, 40 and 60 ºC) and input solution compositions (gypsum-undersaturated and gypsum-equilibrated solutions). We evaluated the effect of these parameters on the coupled reactions of calcite/dolomite dissolution and gypsum/anhydrite precipitation. The CrunchFlow and PhreeqC (v.3) numerical codes were used to perform reactive transport simulations of the experiments.\nUnder the P-pCO2-T conditions, the volume of precipitated gypsum was smaller than the volume of dissolved carbonate minerals, yielding an increase in porosity (Δporosity up to ≈ 4%).\nA decrease in T favored limestone dissolution regardless of pCO2 owing to increasing undersaturation with decreasing temperature. However, gypsum precipitation was favored at high T and under atmospheric pCO2 conditions but not at high T and under 10 bar of pCO2 conditions. The increase in limestone dissolution with pCO2 was directly attributed to pH, which was more acidic at higher pCO2.\nIncreasing pCO2, carbonate dissolution occurred along the column whereas it was localized in the very inlet under atmospheric conditions. This was due to the buffer capacity of the carbonic acid, which maintains pH at around 5 and keeps the solution undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite along the column.\n1D reactive transport simulations reproduced the experimental data (carbonate dissolution and gypsum precipitation for different P-pCO2-T conditions). Drawing on reaction rate laws in the literature, we used the reactive surface area to fit the models to the experimental data. The values of the reactive surface area were much smaller than those calculated of the geometric areas.",

            "abstract": "Mantle plumes have been increasingly studied in the past years, yet they remain not well understood. The Polynesian plume that displays the entire isotopic range known for OIB, provides new perspectives into the global understanding on mantle plume activity on Earth. Here we present new geochemical (whole rock and olivine) and isotopic analyses on samples from Gambier Island, one of the Pitcairn chain islands in Polynesia. Most samples come from a temporal sequence and display small but significant geochemical and isotopic variations. Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic data do not vary much (e.g., 206Pb/204Pb ≈ 19.00 and 87Sr/86Sr ≈ 0.703290) and are very different from the EMI-type values reported for Pitcairn Island and seamounts.\nUsing in situ olivine analyses and REE modeling, we constrain the composition of the mantle source (10% recycled oceanic crust and 90% surrounding peridotite), how both components melt (25-30% for the pyroxenite produced from the oceanic crust and 2-7% for the surrounding peridotite) and by combining these data with published experimental studies, we find that the temperature of Gambier source is rather low temperature compared to other mantle plumes such as Hawaii. We also constrain the age and the nature of the recycled oceanic crust using the isotopic data. The data require the presence of about 3% sedimentary material associated to recycled oceanic basalt and its age is constrained at about 1.5 Ga. A marked Nb-Ta positive anomaly together with elevated Ce/Pb ratios are other indices of the presence of recycled oceanic basalt in the mantle source. Given that these features resemble typical HIMU lavas but that the 1.5 Gy age of the recycled crust is too young to create the extreme Pb isotopic compositions that characterize the HIMU basalts, Gambier Island can be considered as a “young HIMU” island.",

            "abstract": "We present the detection of dark regions in the jovian sub-auroral H3+ emission, first observed in recent December 2012 observations of Jupiter's aurora using CRIRES/VLT and confirmed to be stable on long timescales using a re-analysis of auroral images taken by J. Connerney and T. Satoh as a part of their 1995-2000 NSFCam/IRTF observations of the aurora.\nWhile the auroral region of Jupiter has been studied in great detail, the region equatorward of this has long been thought of as a gently gradated boundary region, with reduced emission towards Jupiter's equator. However, this new detection reveals what appears to be highly localised variable emission: dark regions with sharp boundaries and distinct shapes, offset from the auroral region. These dark features are broadly stable in both magnetic longitude and latitude over timescales of more than fifteen years, and yet vary in small-scale morphology over timescales of less than a month. This changing H3+ emission could represent the localised destruction of H3+, producing a reduction in H3+ density or, alternatively, a cooling of the co-located neutral atmosphere may be reducing the thermalised H3+ emission.\nHowever, what planetary process drives such changes is not clear. These unexplained features cannot be weather systems propagating from lower altitudes, as lower altitude weather systems generally drift along latitudinally bound bands, and these features are fixed in longitude over seasonal timescales. This strongly suggests a magnetospheric origin for the dimming. Perhaps the lack of emission is comparable to the 'Ring Rain' features seen in Saturn's equatorial regions. However, since these dark spots are confined to specific longitudes, unlike the bands of emission seen at Saturn, and their morphology appears to change with time, it is difficult to assign a magnetospheric source that would cause such a reduction in either H3+ density or temperature. Alternatively, the darkening may represent previously unobserved dynamics within the sub-auroral upper atmosphere, driven, and held in place, by auroral processes, resulting in thermospheric weather that is stable on long timescales. Either of these strongly suggests a long-term control of the non-auroral upper atmosphere of Jupiter by the surrounding space environment.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 Mw 6.2 Khaki-Shonbe earthquake occurred in the Simply Folded Belt of the Zagros Mountains, Iran. This is the largest earthquake in the Zagros since the November 1990 Mw 6.4 Furg (Hormozgan) thrust faulting event, and therefore the largest in the period for which dense InSAR ground displacements are available. It is also the biggest seismic event to have occurred in the Simply Folded Belt since the March 1977 Mw 6.7 Khurgu earthquake. This earthquake therefore potentially provides valuable insights into a range of controversies: (1) the preponderance of earthquake faulting in the crystalline basement versus the sedimentary cover and the potential importance of lithology in controlling and limiting seismic rupture; (2) the nature of surface folding and whether or not there is a one-to-one relationship between buried reverse faults and surface anticlines; and (3) the presence or absence of large pulses of aseismic slip triggered by mainshock rupture.\nWe combine seismological solutions and aftershock relocations with satellite interferometric ground displacements and observations from the field to determine the geometry of faulting and its relationship with the structure, stratigraphy and tectonics of the Central Zagros. The earthquake rupture involved reverse slip on two along-strike southwest dipping fault segments, the rupture initiating at the northern and bottom end of the larger north-west segment. These faults verge away from the foreland and towards the high range interior, contrary to the fault geometries depicted in many structural cross-sections of the Zagros. The slip measured on the reverse segments occurred over two mutually exclusive depth ranges, 10–5 km and 4–2 km, resulting in long (16 km), narrow (7 km) rupture segments. Conversely, aftershocks are found to cluster in the depth range 8–16 km, beneath the main rupture segment. This indicates only significant reverse slip and coseismic shortening in the sedimentary cover, with the slip distribution likely to be lithologically controlled in depth by the Hormuz salt at the base of the sedimentary cover, and the Kazhdumi Formation mudrocks at upper-levels (5 km), and aftershocks constrained largely beneath the main coseismic rupture planes.",

            "abstract": "Southwest Asia, which contains the nations of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, is a water-stressed and semi-arid region that receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall during November-April. The cold season climate of Southwest Asia is strongly influenced by tropical Indo-Pacific variability on intraseasonal, interannual, and decadal time scales, much of which can be attributed to sea surface temperature (SST) variations. A decade of dry conditions, and many of the driest years within the observational record since 1940, occurred during the 2000s, which resulted in adverse socioeconomic impacts, including widespread famine in the region. Here, we examine: 1) the historical context of the 2000s drought over Southwest Asia in terms of the atmospheric forcing of precipitation and their influences on soil moisture and runoff and 2) the potential predictability of future seasonal and decadal hydrologic extremes.\nThe synchronous SST forcing of Pacific Decadal variability in the negative phase and a warm west Pacific Ocean throughout the 2000s resulted in persistent atmospheric circulations responsible for reduced Southwest Asia precipitation. The Pacific SSTs forced anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Southwest Asia, which displaced the climatological storm track northward and interacted with the mean climate, resulting in subsidence and reduced precipitation. These atmospheric conditions over Southwest Asia were extraordinary, having never occurred for such an extended time in the observational record. During La Niña events, the aforementioned atmospheric circulations were intensified, resulting in three of the driest years since 1940.\nWe utilize model based soil moisture and runoff as well as observed streamflow data for analyzing 2000s drought events and examine the contribution of initial hydrologic state in seasonal scale drought predictability in this region.",

            "abstract": "To remain hot, permanent lava lakes require a continuous connection to a magma reservoir. Depending on the state of the conduit, changes in magma pressure could result in changes in the lake level (hydraulic head) or be accommodated elastically leading to surface deformation. Observing deformation is therefore key to understanding the plumbing system associated with lava lakes. However, the majority of the world’s lava lakes lie in difficult socio-economic or remote locations meaning that there are few ground-based observations, and it is often necessary to rely on satellite imagery.\nKarthala volcano experienced a sequence of eruptions in April 2005, Nov 2005, May 2006 and Jan 2007. The first 3 took place at the Choungou Chahale crater, which typically contains either a water or lava lake; the last formed a new pit crater to the north. Satellite thermal imagery (Hirn et al, 2008) does not show an anomaly during the first eruption, which had a phreatomagmatic component, but large thermal anomalies, associated with an ephemeral lava lake were detected during the Nov 2005 and May 2006 eruptions. The final eruption produced a smaller anomaly attributed to a minor lava flow.\nHere we present InSAR observations from 2004-2010. We find no significant deformation associated with the first three eruptions, but the January 2007 eruption was associated with ~25 cm of deformation near the volcano’s summit, characteristic of a dyke intrusion aligned with the northern rift zone. We also observe an unusual pattern deformation along the coast which may be attributed to rapid settling of soft sediment or recent volcanic deposits triggered by seismic activity.\nWe propose that the first eruption cleared the reservoir-summit connection and interacted with the water in Choungou Chahale. The following eruptions formed a lava lake, but without causing deformation. By the final eruption, the conduit had become blocked and magma intruded along the rift zone causing deformation but no thermal anomaly. The dyke intersected the surface at Choungou Chagnoumeni.\nAt Karthala volcano, no deformation is associated with lava lake activity, but when the conduit is blocked, magma intrudes along the rift zone causing deformation. This is in contrast to observations at Kileauea in Hawaii, where both lake level changes and deformation occur simultaneously.",

S.) are provided by National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC), which is being built by NOAA in partnership with the U.S. EPA. NAQFC provides nationwide operational predictions of ozone, smoke from wildfires, as well as dust from dust storms for the contiguous 48 states. Predictions are produced beyond midnight of the following day at 12 km resolution and 1 hour time intervals and distributed at\nhttp://airquality.weather.gov\n.\nOzone predictions and developmental testing of aerosol predictions combine the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational North American Mesoscale (NAM) weather predictions with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Predictions of smoke and dust storms use the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Routine verification of ozone and developmental aerosol predictions relies on AIRNow observations, whereas smoke and dust predictions rely on satellite retrievals.\nRecent updates to operational ozone prediction at NOAA have focused on mobile emissions, which were updated using the projections of mobile sources for 2012. Satellite and ground observations were used to derive NOx trends, which were compared with the emissions data used by NAQFC indicating improved agreement over large metropolitan areas in the US. Updates to the chemical mechanism are being tested for operational implementation.\nRecent testing of PM2.5 predictions is relying on National Emission Inventory (NEI) inputs augmented by real time sources from wildfires and dust storms. Testing of PM2.5 predictions continues to exhibit seasonal biases – overprediction in the winter and underprediction in the summer.

            "abstract": "Satellite imagery covers volcanoes globally throughout their eruptive cycles, independent of ground-based monitoring and thus InSAR can give information on both intrusive and extrusive processes at a large number of volcanoes in a range of tectonic settings. Not all deformation is followed by an eruption, nor are all eruptions preceded by measureable deformation. In many cases volcanic deformation is linked to magma intrusion, instability of the volcanic edifice or changes in the hydrothermal system.\nHere we provide a summary of global observations of volcano deformation and carry out a probabilistic analysis of the link between deformation and eruption. We show that, of the 198 volcanoes systematically observed for the past 18 years, 54 deformed, of which 25 also erupted. In terms of assessing eruption potential, this substantial proportion of deforming volcanoes that also erupted (46%), together with the very high proportion of non-deforming volcanoes that did not erupt (94%) shows that deformation status represents ‘strong’ evidential worth. From the perspective of the growth of continental crust, it demonstrates that roughly half of all deformation-generating episodes occurred at volcanoes with no recent eruptions.\n Next, using a larger catalogue of 540 volcanoes observed for 3 years, we demonstrate how this eruption–deformation relationship is influenced by tectonic, petrological and volcanic factors. Deformation and eruption are most directly linked (a higher PPV) for hotspot regions (0.33), basaltic (0.29) and andesitic compositions (0.34) and most weakly linked for rhyolite/dacite compositions (0.17), calderas (0.25) and rift settings (0.13). This indicates that tectonic setting and crustal stress state play primary roles in determining the proportion of subsurface and extrusive events.\nSatellite technology is rapidly evolving and routine monitoring of the deformation status of all volcanoes from space is anticipated, meaning probabilistic approaches will increasingly inform hazard decisions and strategic development, and could also be used to inform the debate on continental growth.",

            "abstract": "Animal production exerts significant demand on land, water and food resources and is an extensive means by which humans modify natural systems. Demand for animal source foods has more than tripled over the past 50 years due to population growth and dietary change. To meet this demand, livestock intensification (e.g. concentrated animal feeding operations) has increased and with it the water, nitrogen and carbon footprints of animal production. However, grass-fed systems continue to contribute significantly to overall animal production. To date, little is known about the contributions of grass- and grain-fed systems to animal calorie production, how this has changed through time and to what extent these two systems are sensitive to climate. Using a calorie-based approach we hypothesize that grain-fed systems are increasing in importance (with serious implications for water and nutrient demand) and that rangeland productivity is correlated with rainfall. Our findings show that grass-fed systems made up the majority of animal calorie production since 1960 years but that the relative contribution of grain-fed system has increased (from 27% to 49%). This rapid transition towards grain-fed animal production is largely a result of changing diets demand, as we found the growth of grass-fed production only kept pace with population growth. On a regional scale, we find that Asia has been the major contributor to the increase in grass-fed animal calorie production and that Africa has undergone the most drastic transition from grass-fed to grain-fed dependence. Finally, as expected we see a positive relationship between rangeland productivity and precipitation and a shift from dairy- to meat-dominated production going from drier to wetter climates. This study represents a new means of analyzing the food security of animal products and an important step in understanding the historic trends of animal production, their relation to climate, their prospects for the future and their implications for freshwater resources and nutrient cycling.",

However given the complex interactions between air, land and sea in the region, aerosol impact studies are significantly confounded by a host of meteorological phenomena. At the same time, aerosol and other compositional studies add a new perspective on atmospheric processes. In this presentation we briefly outline aerosol lifecycle connections to the phases of ENSO, IOD, and the MJO as observed in measurements made through networks and intensive operations periods. However, our focus is on the ramification of these observations on aerosol-cloud relationships at more regional and local levels. Connections between the MJO and tropical cyclone formation as well as the advection of lower free tropospheric dry layers frame aerosol-convection relationships. The frequent formation of trans-MC squall lines and their associated cold pools significantly modifies common conceptual models of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction. We close with a list of suggested tropical meteorology research topics and questions which we believe are most relevant to understanding atmospheric composition in this region.",

            "abstract": "Drought has cascading effects on the environment, economy and society. Seasonal water deficits resulting from natural variability in rainfall coupled with increased demands have severe implications for the adequacy of water storage in both surface and groundwater stores. Managers need better estimates of potential shortfalls in supply due to droughts of varying severity and duration. While global and national drought indicators exist, none directly connect existing or projected water demand to the potential deficit during the drought. They are essentially supply based. However, the temporal patterns of both demand and supply ultimately determine the stress or impact. Consequently, assessment of risk for various sectorial operations could be much better informed if appropriate stress indices were developed for drought conditions relative to current and projected demands, and their likelihood assessed for future climate scenarios.\nThe present research addresses this methodological gap by (1) developing new drought indices that consider both water supply and current or projected sectorial demands, and (2) developing insights into the large-scale climatic drivers for forecasting drought onset, duration and severity up to one season ahead for climate informed adaptive risk assessment and long-term planning.\nWe present an application at a county level for the conterminous United States considering more than 60 years of rainfall data as the renewable supply, and water demand patterns for 3 sectors (agricultural, industrial, and domestic use). The demand data are available at the county level. Consequently, we use the county rather than river basins as the unit of analysis. The county is also a spatial resolution consistent with political decision making. The index is useful for indicating whether small or large surface storage will suffice, or whether the extent of groundwater storage or external transfers, or changes in demand are needed to achieve a sustainable solution.",

Coupled with poverty, these factors intensify local communities’ vulnerability to climate change. This study highlights the Arun watershed in eastern Nepal as a case study to evaluate how local communities in high altitude regions are managing their water for domestic and agricultural needs while coping with extreme events, such as floods and landslides. Remotely-sensed precipitation, snowpack and glacial extent data from the past decade are combined with preliminary results from extensive field-based community surveys in the Arun watershed. The analysis of remotely-sensed data will describe seasonal trends in water availability, glacial lake growth, and the spatial variation of these trends within the basin. These hydrologic changes will be linked to the human survey analysis, which will provide an understanding of locals’ perceptions of water challenges and the current water management strategies within the basin. Particular attention will be given to a comparison between the eastern and western tributaries of the Arun River, where the catchments are mainly rain-fed (eastern) versus glacial-fed (western). This contrast will highlight how different hydrologic scenarios evidenced from remote-sensing data motivate diverse human water management responses as defined in field surveys. A particular focus will be given to management decisions related to agriculture expansion and hydropower development. This synthesis of remote-sensing and social research methodologies provides a valuable perspective on coupled human-hydrologic systems.",

MOOSE provides a set of computational tools that scientists and engineers can use to create sophisticated multiphysics simulations. Applications built using MOOSE have computed solutions for chemical reaction and transport equations, computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat conduction, mesoscale materials modeling, geomechanics, and others.\nTo facilitate the coupling of diverse and highly-coupled physical systems, MOOSE employs the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method when solving the coupled nonlinear systems of equations arising in multiphysics applications. The MOOSE framework is written in C++, and leverages other high-quality, open-source scientific software packages such as LibMesh, Hypre, and PETSc. MOOSE uses a “hybrid parallel” model which combines both shared memory (thread-based) and distributed memory (MPI-based) parallelism to ensure efficient resource utilization on a wide range of computational hardware.\nMOOSE-based applications are inherently modular, which allows for simulation expansion (via coupling of additional physics modules) and the creation of multi-scale simulations. Any application developed with MOOSE supports running (in parallel) any other MOOSE-based application. Each application can be developed independently, yet easily communicate with other applications (e.g., conductivity in a slope-scale model could be a constant input, or a complete phase-field micro-structure simulation) without additional code being written.

            "abstract": "Pavlof Volcano on the Alaska Peninsula began to erupt on August 14, 2007 after an 11 year repose. Pavlof is the most active volcano in the Aleutians, with over 40 eruptions in historical times. The 2007 eruption began with low-frequency earthquakes and thermal anomalies. Strombolian activity occurred from a newly formed vent on the SE flank of the volcano. The plume reached 20,000 ft during the peak of the eruption on August 29th and 30th. Seismic activity, monitored by a network of 5 local instruments, consisted of low-frequency events, explosion quakes, volcanic tremor, and lahar-generated signals. Here we focus on explosion quakes. The first explosion quake occurred August 14th at 2:54pm UTC and the last on September 13th at 3:14pm UTC. Explosion events were often embedded in continuous tremor, but could be distinguished by the ground-coupled air waves, which appeared as a high-frequency spike superimposed on the lower-frequency ground waves. Rates were as high as 19 explosion quakes per minute. We establish whether systematic changes in explosion rates, signal properties, and ground-coupled air-wave amplitudes correlate with the height and ash content of the plume. First order trends show a positive correlation between increased explosion quake rates, increased amplitudes, and plume height. In addition, we investigate how atmospheric conditions such as wind speed and direction affect the recording of the ground-coupled air-wave. The time differences in the airwaves at different stations are consistent with the acoustic speed of 340 m/s, but show variations of up to 0.6 s depending on wind speed and direction. Eruptions at Pavlof typically have little or no seismic precursors; this combined with the low visibility common to the area results in Pavlof being dangerous to the many aviation routes that transverse this airspace. It is the goal of this study to determine the conditions under which explosion quake data may be reliably used for more effective monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Many questions remain on the detailed morphology of mantle convection patterns. While high resolution P wave studies show a variety of subducted slab behaviors, some stagnating in the transition zone, others penetrating into the lower mantle (e.g. Fukao & Obayashi, 2013), low velocity structures – the upwelling part of flow – are more difficult to resolve at the same scale. Indeed, depth extent and morphology of the low velocity roots of hotspot volcanoes is still debated, along with the existence of \"mantle plumes\".\nUsing spectral element waveform tomography, we previously constructed a global, radially anisotropic, upper mantle Vs model (SEMum2, French et al., 2013) and have now extended it to the whole mantle by adding shorter period waveform data (SEMUCB-WM1, French & Romanowicz, GJI, in revision). This model shows long wavelength structure in good agreement with other recent global Vs models derived under stronger approximations (Ritsema et al. 2011; Kustowski, et al. 2008), but exhibits better focused, finer scale structure throughout the mantle.\nSEMUCB-WM1 confirms the presence in all major ocean basins of the quasi-periodic, upper mantle low velocity anomalies, previously seen in SEMum2. At the same time, lower mantle low velocity structure is dominated by a small number (~15 globally) of quasi-vertical anomalies forming discrete \"column\"\" rooted at the base of the mantle. Most columns are positioned near major hotspots, as defined by buoyancy flux, and are wider (~800-1000 km diameter) than expected from the thermal plume model – suggestive of thermo-chemical plumes, which may be stable for long times compared to purely thermal ones.\nSome columns reach the upper mantle, while others deflect horizontally near 1000 km – the same depth where many slabs appear to stagnate. As they reach the transition zone, the wide columnar structure can be lost, as these \"plumes\" appear to meander through the upper mantle, perhaps entrained by more vigorous, lower viscosity, convection. Most \"plumes\" in the Pacific LLSVP region appear as isolated columns rising from the CMB, such as beneath Hawaii (rooted near a known ultra low velocity zone, Cottaar & Romanowicz, 2012). Conversely, the African LLSVP region appears more massive up to mid-mantle depths, with isolated \"plumes\" at its borders, including that beneath Iceland.",

            "abstract": "We use a suite of reconstructed water year (WY; October through September) streamflow for 12 river basins in the western United States to reconstruct gridded water year precipitation over a similar western US domain. The streamflow values were reconstructed based on moisture sensitive tree ring records and we used values published in the peer-reviewed literature. A set of Principal Components (PC) of the streamflow reconstructions were calibrated against a complementary PC set from an ~120-year long instrumental record of WY precipitation west of ~90˚W to yield a 407 year reconstruction at each gridpoint. We were motivated to assess the rarity of the current extreme 3-year drought in the Southwest US—particularly in California. Hence, our analysis focuses largely on the moisture side of the water balance, although of course, streamflow is an integrator of both evapotranspiration and precipitation. Nevertheless, the strong calibration and validation statistics obtained in our study (and notably for California and Nevada) suggest that WY streamflow in much of the West is mainly driven by precipitation variability. The current WY drought (2013-14) and three year (2012-2014) extended drought is ranked in the instrumental record for California itself as the driest such period since 1895. In our longer reconstructed record of California and adjacent western Nevada, the current dry episode—exceeding one year's mean total in three years—is similar to only three other such occurrences over the past 440 years, centered on 1654, 1795, and 1930. Analyses of anomalous mid-tropospheric (700 hPa) circulation features over the instrumental period (since 1895) show the presence of persistent anticyclonic flow over, near, and to the west of the US Pacific coast during the driest WYs. Some differences in the location and spatial structure of the anomalous Northeast Pacific ridge are evident and these are discussed in the context of low-frequency climate variability and change.",

            "abstract": "Impact of the groundwater on plant transpiration constitutes an important but not well understood aspect of the interactions between groundwater and the land surface, vegetation and atmosphere. The lack of understanding can be attributed to the limited observations and the complex nature of the problem as the mechanisms and processes involved are many and often tightly coupled. This study addresses such issues by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity Plus (VIC+) land surface model (LSM) in conjunction with a series of numerical experiments. The VIC+ model considers impacts of the hydraulic redistribution (HR), plant storage, photosynthesis, and groundwater table (GWT) dynamics on plant transpiration, and the interactions between plant transpiration and subsurface processes. Several groups of numerical experiments are performed using different combinations of precipitation conditions, vegetation types, soil types, groundwater table depths (GWTDs) and treatment of the HR process. We have found, in water limited climates, vegetation type, soil type and the HR process have strong impacts on transpiration – GWTD relationships. In particular when the HR is significant, such as in drier climates, the inclusion of HR process in the modeling is essential in establishing the correct relationship between the plant transpiration and GWTD, where an omission would result in a more linear-like relationship. In addition, under certain conditions, there exists a transition zone in the relationship between plant transpiration and GWTD, where transpiration drops abruptly as the groundwater table declines. Moreover, plant transpiration and groundwater become disconnected as the groundwater table declines further and lies below the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Water deficit is the main factor responsible for soybean yield gap in Southern Brazil and tends to increase under climate change scenarios. Alternatives need be identified in order to create options to reduce the yield gap. One alternative is the selection of soybean cultivars with traits associated to drought tolerance. Thus, the aim of this study, via use of crop models, is to evaluate genetic traits that can help to improve soybean yield under climate change scenarios in Southern Brazil by improving the crop tolerance to water deficit. For this, the CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean model was used to simulate soybean yield in Southern Brazil and evaluate yield with altered genetic traits. The first step was to calibrate the model for a Brazilian soybean cultivar, using results from irrigated and rainfed experiments conducted in different sowing dates and locations in Southern Brazil. The CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean estimated a mean yield of 3551 (SD = 1439) kg ha-1, while the mean observed yield was 3313 (SD = 1105) kg ha-1. The mean error was 238 kg ha-1 (7.2%), mean error absolute was 765 kg ha-1 (23%) and modeling efficiency was 0.27, with a good relationship between observed and simulated yield (Figure 1). The model was able to estimate soybean yield for different levels of soil water available during the crop season. The next steps of the project are to manipulate the coefficients related with rooting depth extension, early stomata closure at high soil water contents, transpiration limited to a maximum rate, and N2 fixation drought tolerance in the model in order to identify their impact on yield under current and future climate scenarios in all soybean production regions in Southern Brazil. The soybean yield from different changed traits will be evaluated in order to define guidelines for breeding programs, allowing the saving of resources and time in the new cultivars development process, focused on adaptation to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic and geothermal emissions are known natural sources of volatiles to the atmosphere. Volcanogenic air pollutants known to cause the most serious impact are carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Some studies into the potential for volcanic emissions to produce chronic diseases in humans indicate that areas of major concern include respiratory problems, particularly silicosis (Allen et al. 2000; Baxter et al. 1999; Buist et al. 1986), psychological stress (Shore et al. 1986), and chemical impacts of gas or ash (Giammanco et al. 1998). Sulphur Springs Park in Saint Lucia has a very high recreational value with >200,000 visitors annually, while the nearby town of Soufrière has >8,400 residents. Residents and visitors have raised concerns about the volcanic emissions and its health effects. As part of the volcanic surveillance programme undertaken by the UWI, Seismic Research Centre (SRC) in Saint Lucia, a new monitoring network has been established for quantifying the ambient SO2 in air, to which staff and visitors at the volcanic park are exposed to. The implementation and continued operation of this network has involved the training of local personnel in the active field sampling and analytical techniques required for the assessment of ambient SO2 concentrations, using a low cost monitor as well as commercial passive samplers. This approach recognizes that environmental hazards are a usual part of life and productive livelihoods, and to minimize post-disaster response and recovery it is beneficial to promote preparedness and mitigation, which is best achieved at the local level with community involvement. It is also intended that the volcanic emissions monitoring network could be used as a method to establish and maintain community-based initiatives that would also be helpful when volcanic threat manifests.",

            "abstract": "The large amounts of data generated by volcano observatories, especially during volcanic crises, can present a challenge for rapid analysis of changing event behaviour. Statistical analysis of seismic events, e.g. spectral analysis and identification of waveform families (i.e. multiplet analysis) can be useful tools in characterising the seismicity and can provide another layer of information for volcano observatories. Additionally, multiplet analysis of existing data from key eruptions can reveal patterns of behaviour that are not evident from individual event metrics (e.g. locations, amplitudes, frequency content etc.). However, large scale multiplet analysis has previously been hindered by the computational limitations associated with cross-correlation of large data sets. Event classification remains crucial to volcano monitoring and to retrospective analysis of key eruption data, but such methods are often not straightforward to implement. We present a program, PEAKMATCH, which can be used for spectral and multiplet analysis of large data sets, and can be used for simple automatic classification of volcanic events. Our optimised cross-correlation approach can efficiently handle the cross-correlation of hundreds of thousands of events making large-scale multiplet studies a reality. Much of the crucial information for classifying an event lies in the frequency domain and by using spectral ratios and cluster analysis we are able to automatically classify events without an extensive training period. We apply our method to seismic data from Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat from the end of the last extrusion period in February 2010 until January 2014 to characterise the multiplet behaviour during an extended period of quiescence. We observe notable changes in multiplet behaviour surrounding the period of ash venting in March 2012.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes and the governing geomorphic processes that shape them have been described in a conceptual framework of process domains. At a coarse scale, process domains are segregated between hillslope, colluvial, and alluvial processes, which can be distinguished by governing erosional processes and partitioned by local slope-drainage area relationships. In landscapes that have experienced dramatic topographic alteration such as the mountaintop coal-mining (MTM) region of central Appalachia, the resulting modified environment may be considered a synthetic landscape. Such a landscape has process domains that are decoupled from prior landscape evolution trajectories. In particular, landslide and debris flow processes, which are a predominant geomorphic agent in these steep mountain systems and a primary sediment delivery mechanism to the downstream fluvial network, may be eliminated from this landscape and detectable through changes in slope-area relationships. We evaluate differences in slope-area relationships using 10-m DEMs between two time periods, pre-mined and post-mined. At five study site located within the MTM region in the central Appalachian Mountains, US, we compare slope-area changes to adjacent unmined landscapes over the same time periods. Distinct differences exist in the character of slope-area relationships between unmined and MTM sites and local slopes are systematically and considerably reduced in all process zones of mined sites. In particular, there is an expansion of the unchanneled valley zone through either an individual or simultaneous upslope shift into the hillslope region and downslope shift into the debris flow region. In addition, local slopes are markedly reduced (33% to 44%) in the post-mined period relative to the pre-mined period at all sites and are generally below the threshold required to trigger landslides and debris flows. The consequence of altered erosion processes in this upper portion of the catchment, particularly the potential elimination of landslide and debris flow processes, is a downstream river network starved of its primary sediment source. Decreases in sediment supply will translate to increases in hydraulic driving forces with the fluvial network and increased bank erosion and bed incision processes.",

            "abstract": "Mixing controls volcanic plume behavior. Our understanding of mixing therefore places a critical limit on our capacity to manage volcanic plume hazards. Researchers have investigated mixing for two situations: volcanic plumes with rise times that are long or short relative to the eruption duration. The plumes generated in these two situations are then modeled as thermals or maintained plumes, respectively. The case in the middle, when plume rise times are comparable to the eruption durations, is not often considered. This third class is appropriate to discrete eruptions, such as Strombolian- or Vulcanian-style eruptions, which last a few seconds or tens of seconds and generate relatively small plumes. Here we use numerical experiments to show that mixing occurs differently in this third eruption class because of dynamic features that are distinct from the long- and instantaneous-duration end members. In this presentation we focus on the effect of eruption duration on mixing in the inertia-driven or jet-like phase of ascending volcanic plumes. Our simulation results reveal that air entrainment rates increase after the eruption ends, resulting in enhanced overall mixing in jets from shorter-duration eruptions. Models developed for the other two mixing situations do not predict these results. New models are required for volcanic plumes with rise times comparable to their durations in order to reliably estimate their behavior for hazard management purposes.",

            "abstract": "Surface waters are an important pathway for the transport of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) from terrestrial watersheds. Dissolved Hg (HgD) is thought to be more bioavailable than particulate Hg and has been found to be strongly correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in numerous watersheds. The ratio of HgD to DOC is highly variable from site to site, which we hypothesize is strongly dependent on local environmental factors such as atmospheric deposition and soil organic carbon (SOC). Sixteen watersheds throughout the United States were used in this study to determine the relationship between the ratio of HgD:DOC, Hg wet deposition, and SOC. The Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) and Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) were used to determine SOC values while HgD:DOC values were obtained from previous studies. Hg wet deposition was reported by the Mercury Deposition Network. There was no correlation found between atmospheric mercury wet deposition and HgD:DOC (r2 = 0.04; p = 0.44) but SOC was able to explain about 71% of the variation in the HgD:DOC ratio (r2 = 0.71; p < 0.01). A mathematical framework was developed to explain the power-law relationship between SOC and HgD:DOC based on soil carbon pools. The framework infers that the amount of Hg adsorbed to SOC does not increase in proportion to SOC at high SOC levels and points towards a Hg supply limitation for adsorption to soils with relatively deep carbon pools. Overall, this study identifies SOC as a first-order control on the association of HgD and DOC and indicates that globally available SOC datasets can be utilized to predict Hg transport in stream systems.",

Traditionally, data from these different missions are distributed separately from one another and they each possess different data formats, making it cumbersome for researchers to access, analyze, and perform inter-comparison.\nWe present an effort at JPL to design a web-based science data environment (co2.jpl.nasa.gov) that allows users to access and utilize CO2 data from GOSAT, AIRS, OCO-2, TES, and the ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) in a single user-friendly interface. The features of the data environment include the ability to download full mission-specific CO2-related Level 2 data files or to customize them based on location, time, data variable, version, and format. An important feature of the JPL CO2 data environment is that it allows generation of customized Level 3 products and provides detailed documentation on the mission specifications along with technical data information.

Beyond\nthe mere intellectual interest of these observations, they open the door\nto possible applications towards a range of complementary methods of tsunami\nwarning.\nFinally, the deep 2013 Okhotsk Sea earthquake has generated a\nsmall but recordable tsunami, whose millimetric amplitude is correctly\npredicted by a number of methodologies, suggesting that deep events may\ncontribute to tsunami hazard, if even larger-sized deep earthquakes could\noccur.",

            "abstract": "Estuaries provide critical habitat for many economically and culturally important species. In the Pacific Northwest, intertidal and subtidal areas provide critical habitat for production of native and commercial oysters (Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida and Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, respectively) that in turn provide refuge and rearing habitat for Dungeness Crab, Metacarcinus magister. Environments ranging from subtidal through freshwater zones provide nursery areas for juvenile salmonids at different development stages in their life history. Most Oregon estuaries have been significantly altered by humans over the past century, reducing the quantity and diversity of available habitats. Management agencies have responded with projects to restore and enhance estuarine habitats. Unfortunately, future climate change and sea-level rise could render many current restoration projects ineffective over time. Planning for habitat restoration that keeps pace with climate change will be critical to the sustainable production of seafood and maintenance of ecosystem function. However, land managers and citizens lack the spatially-explicit data needed to incorporate the potential effects of climate change and sea-level rise into planning for habitat improvement projects in estuarine areas. To meet this need, we developed simple models using LiDAR to characterize the geomorphologies of multiple Oregon estuaries. We were able to map the margin of current mean high tide, and contour intervals associated with different potential increases in mean high tide. Because our analysis relied on digital data, we compared three types of digital data in one estuary to assess the utility of different data sets in predicting changes in estuary shape. For each estuary, we assessed changes in the amount and complexity of edge habitats. The simple modeling approach we applied can also be used to identify areas that may be most amenable to pre-emptive restoration actions to mitigate or enhance habitats under future climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Cordon Caulle eruption represents an ideal case study for the characterization of long-lasting plumes that are strongly affected by wind. The climactic phase lasted for about one day and was classified as subplinian to small-moderate with plumes between 9-12 km above the vent and Mass Flow Rate (MFR) on the order of 107 kg/s. The first 10 days of the eruption had MFR values >106 kg/s and were followed by several months of low-intensity plumes. Plume dynamics and rise were strongly affected by wind during the whole eruption, with negligible up-wind spreading. Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) due to column collapse were mostly observed on June 4th-5th when wind velocity was lowest and MFR highest, suggesting that PDC generation can be reduced by wind advection. Individual phases of the eruption range between VEI 3-4, while the cumulative deposit associated with June 4th-7th, 2011, is associated with a VEI 5 and a minimum magnitude of 4.8. Crosswind cloud spreading and deposit dispersal of the first few days could be best described by a linear combination of gravitational spreading and turbulent diffusion, with velocities between 1-10 m/s and diffusion coefficients that are consistent with measured values for atmospheric diffusivity. Downwind cloud spreading could be best described by a linear combination of gravitational intrusion and wind advection, with velocities between 17-45 m/s. Our results show how gravitational spreading can be significant even for small-moderate eruptions strongly advected by wind and with relatively low Richardson number and low MFR.",

            "abstract": "Until 2008, abiotic methane in land-based serpentinized ultramafic rocks was documented (including gas and C- and H- isotope compositions) only at sites in Oman, Philippines, New Zealand and Turkey. Methane emanates from seeps and/or hyperalkaline water springs along faults and is associated with molecular hydrogen. These were considered to be very unusual and rare occurrences of gas. Now, methane is documented for peridotite-based springs or seeps (in ophiolites, orogenic massifs or intrusions) in US, Canada, Costa Rica, Greece, Italy, Japan, New Caledonia, Portugal, Spain and United Arab Emirates. Gas flux measurements are indicating that methane can also flux as invisible microseepages from the ground, through fractured peridotites, even far removed from seeps and springs. Methane C-isotope ratios range from -6 to -37 permil (VPDB) for dominantly abiotic methane. The more 13-C depleted values, e.g., California, are likely mixed with biotic gas (microbial and thermogenic gas). Methane H-isotope ratios cover a wide range from -118 to -333 permil (VSMOW). The combination of C- and H-isotopes clearly distinguish biotic from abiotic methane. Radiocarbon (14-C) analysis from bubbling seeps in Italian peridotites indicate that the methane is fossil (pMC <0.2), i.e., older than 50,000 years, similar to the Chimaera seeps in Turkey. So, methane observed in the hyperalkaline waters cannot be produced in the same waters because these are only a few thousands years old. The low temperatures of land-based peridotites (generally <100 °C at depths of 3-4 km) also constrain methane production. We discuss some hypotheses concerning gas generation in water vs. dry systems, i.e., in deeper, older, waters or in unsaturated rocks). We also discuss low vs. high temperatures, i.e., at the present-day low T conditions or at higher temperatures eventually occurring in the early stages of peridotite emplacement on land.",

Although the projected effects of extreme events and land use change on hydrology have been resonably well studied, the impacts on urban water quality have not been widely examined due in part to the scale mismatch between global climate models and the spatial scales required to represent urban hydrology and water quality signals. Here we describe a grid-based modeling system that integrates the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) and urban water quality module adpated from EPA’s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Using the model system, we evaluate, for four partially urbanized catchments within the Puget Sound basin, urban water quality under current climate conditions, and projected potential changes in urban water quality associated with future changes in climate and land use. We examine in particular total suspended solids, toal nitrogen, total phosphorous, and coliform bacteria, with catchment representations at the 150-meter spatial resolution and the sub-daily timestep. We report long-term streamflow and water quality predictions in response to extreme precipitation events of varying magnitudes in the four partially urbanized catchments.

Estimated slip up to 8–9 m was concentrated in a region southeast of the hypocenter, and overall, the slip distribution shows spatial correspondence with regions of asperities estimated from geologic data in northern Chile. Tens of thousands of open cracks throughout coastal regions of northern Chile, including several thousand that were freshly opened by the Pisagua earthquake sequence, preserve a record of coseismic stress throughout the past million years. Inversion of these inferred stress orientations for megathrust slip, representing a cumulative or average earthquake on the northern Chilean subduction zone, reveals two concentrations of slip: one coincident with the hypocenter and the other located close to the peak slip estimated from seismic waveform and geodetic inversions from the 2014 event. This suggests that the rupture of various asperities in northern Chile in earthquakes with a 125–150 year recurrence interval may occur repeatedly over neotectonic time scales. Geologic evidence of earthquake-related forearc deformation and the consistency in earthquake rupture patterns that it implies complement the growing body of geophysical data aimed at characterizing the spatiotemporal signatures of seismic cycle processes on the world’s megathrusts.",

Principle components include training participants to assess risk, from hazard to vulnerability, and communicate effectively with government agencies, media, public and private sectors before, during and after natural disasters. Nine weeks of training involve 5 weeks of lectures in Geneva (in English), 2 weeks of field immersion and 2 weeks of exams. Participant experience culminates in completion of an independent research memoir carried out over an additional 6 months.\nThe course is divided into five modules: the risk management module, which includes humanities and social sciences and brings together a multi-disciplinary team of experts to provide participants with tools they can use to assess hazard, vulnerability and risk and provide solutions to risk management issues in their own countries; and four thematic risk modules, i.e., volcanic risk, seismic risk, landslide risk, and flood and climate related risk. As part of the volcanic risk module we also carry out a role-play exercise at the elementary school in Vulcano Island, Italy in collaboration with the Italian Civil Protection with the double goal of sensitizing the CERG-C participants on the importance of training hazard and risk at an early stage in people’s life as well as to raise awareness in the local population on topics such as the evaluation of volcanic hazards and risk, management of a volcanic crisis, and the importance of the collaboration between citizens and official institutions, such as the Civil Protection.\nThe CERG-C has been training international graduate students and practitioners since 1988 on a yearly basis.

Existing parameterisations of the circulation and mixing of such inflows are often based on the entrainment of ambient fluid into the underflowing gravity currents.

A theoretical model of the observed peeling detrainment was developed to predict the temperature profile in the basin. This new model gives a better approximation of the temperature profile observed in the experiments than the pre-existing entraining model.

Clarification of the net effect of landscape evolution on the C cycle may be achieved using coupled fully-distributed modelling of hydro-geomorphic and biogeochemical processes.\nWe developed a distributed model of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics within an existing coupled physically-based hydro-geomorphic model (tRIBS - Erosion) to simulate the effects of soil erosion and deposition on C dynamics at basin scale. The SOC mass balance is analytically formulated at each cell using temporally variant, continuous vertical profiles of SOC content and SOC production and oxidation rate constants derived from SOC turnover characteristics. Landscape evolution feedbacks on C dynamics include the redistribution of eroded SOC, and the alteration of the SOC production and oxidation throughout the corresponding vertical profiles due to geomorphic perturbations. At each time step, model outputs include lateral and vertical C fluxes, and SOC content, at each soil column.\nWe applied the model to the Calhoun Experimental Forest in South Carolina, which constitutes a forest recovering from agricultural land degradation prior to the mid-20th century. To test performance we carried out a point comparison against a spreadsheet-based model, SOrCERO (Soil Organic Carbon, Erosion, Replacement, and Oxidation) of SOC dynamics, which estimates effects of SOC erosion and altered SOC production and oxidation on CO2 release at an eroding profile. At a point, time integrated results from the two models were comparable. The proposed model has the additional advantage of being able to quantify C sinks and sources across the landscape in a spatially explicit manner, by systematically accounting for topographic controls on C dynamics. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the alteration of SOC production and oxidation due to landscape evolution and management practices exert a strong control on soil-atmosphere C exchange.",

Although most developed countries have sophisticated observing systems for many variables in the natural surface water cycle, long-term and consistent records that focus on water management and human impacts on the global water cycle are much more limited, and most land surface models ignore water management activities. We describe a continental-scale model of reservoir storage, which is combined with a soil moisture deficit-based irrigation scheme within the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-scale hydrological model to simulate the effects of water management in the major river basins of the world. The model is forced with merged NCEP/NCAR and satellite meteorological data at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees latitude-longitude, for the period 1948 to 2010. A total of 167 of the largest reservoirs in the world with a total storage capacity around 3900 km3 (nearly 60% of the global total reservoir storage) are simulated. We successfully predict the monthly reservoir storage time series for most of a set of 23 global reservoirs for which observed storage is available either via in situ or satellite remote sensing measurements.

            "abstract": "Extra-tropical cyclones, including Winter Westerly Disturbances (WWD) over central Asia, are fundamental features of the atmosphere that maintain energy, momentum, and moisture at global scales while intimately linking large-scale circulation to regional-scale meteorology. Within High Mountain Asia (HMA), there is no mechanism that is more important in contributing to water supply during winter, and therefore it is important that we create a baseline climatology of these disturbances and further explore variability over time. Eulerian methods of investigating variance of fields related to WWD at synoptic scales are typically employed as a general measure of storm track activity. However, Eulerian statistics cannot convey important information regarding the specifics of individual systems, nor can the attributes of a cyclone be taken directly. Thus, a Lagrangian method of automatically tracking WWD, which can provide complementary information about individual systems and allows us to investigate track activity, is desired. Currently, there is no technique that adequately captures WWD, which often propagate along relatively low latitudes, encounter highly variable topography, exhibit strong tropical influences, and are highly asymmetric.\nIn this study, we utilize the atmospheric wave signature of WWD in upper-level geopotential height to identify individual systems responsible for HMA precipitation and track their life cycles. This provides a valuable link between the large-scale climate, transient disturbances, and hydrologic processes within HMA, and allows us to evaluate WWD on a per-case basis while considering all factors that relate these systems to precipitation in the mountains. This framework enables us to consider the relative contribution of dynamically forced orographic precipitation in HMA associated with cyclone intensity and wind speed, as well as the contribution of convective instability, which may facilitate heavy precipitation with weak mechanical forcing of air over topography. Our individual event perspective aids in understanding the non-linear relationship between the strength of an extra-tropical cyclone, the characteristics of interacting air-masses over the Indian subcontinent, and the amount of precipitation received in HMA.",

            "abstract": "Designing and monitoring of geothermal systems is a complex task which requires a multidisciplinary approach. Deep geothermal reservoir models are prone to greater uncertainty, with a lack of direct data and lower resolution of surface geophysical methods. However, recent technical advances have enabled the potential use of permanent downhole vertical resistivity arrays for monitoring fluid injection. As electrical resistivity is sensitive to temperature changes, such data could provide valuable information for deep geothermal reservoir characterization.\nThe objective of this study is to assess the potential of time-lapse cross-borehole ERT to constrain 3D realizations of geothermal reservoir properties. The synthetic case of a permeable geothermal reservoir in a sedimentary basin was set up, as a confined deep and saline sandstone aquifer with intermediate reservoir temperatures (150ºC), depth (1 km) and 30m thickness. The reservoir permeability distribution is heterogeneous, as the result of a fluvial depositional environment. The ERT monitoring system design is a triangular arrangement of 3 wells at 150 m spacing, including 1 injection and 1 extraction well. The optimal number and spacing of electrodes of the ERT array design is site-specific and has been assessed through a sensibility study. Dipole-dipole and pole-pole electrode configurations were used.\nThe study workflow was the following: 1) Generation of a reference reservoir model and 100 stochastic realizations of permeability; 2) Simulation of saturated single-phase flow and heat transport of reinjection of cooled formation fluid (50ºC) with TOUGH2 software; 3) Time-lapse forward ERT modeling on the reference model and all realizations (observed and simulated apparent resistivity change); 4) heuristic optimization on ERT computed and calculated data. Preliminary results show significant reduction of parameter uncertainty, hence realization space, with assimilation of cross-borehole ERT data. Loss in sensitivity of ERT between boreholes is compensated here by the stochastic modeling approach, rather than using a deterministic inversion scheme. Our results suggest stochastic reservoir simulations, together with assimilation of cross-borehole ERT data, could be useful tools for design and monitoring of deep geothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface reservoir modelling, whether for groundwater, storage or oil/gas production relies on geophysical data for determining structure, rocks and fluid variations. The traditional approach depends on stochastic inversion of the geophysical image into subsurface models. However, in addition to geophysical data a wealth of geological information is available from analog or previous studies. Most of this information is ignored, and inversions resort to more mathematically-inspired priors often based on covariance models. In this presentation, using a real field application, we propose a method to validate a rich geological prior with geophysical data without the need for costly inversions. The result of this work is a wide, but geologically-realistic prior that can then be used in subsequent stochastic inversions. To achieve this, we propose to validate plausible geological models (from analog studies) with the observed geophysical data through a global, pattern-based measure of dissimilarity. This global dissimilarity measure is defined between the forward simulated geophysical response of a large variety of geologically plausible models and the observed field data. The proposed dissimilarity measure relies on a comparison of the wavelet decompositions between observed and forward simulated geophysical responses. The difference in frequency distribution of the wavelet coefficients is used via a JS-divergence measure to define the dissimilarity between all the subsurface models and the observed data.\nThe proposed approach is applied to a real field offshore reservoir in West Africa, where a 3D seismic cube is available. The uncertain geological parameters defined for this case are the rock physic model, the infill channels size, depth, sinuosity, the proportion of sand/shale and the stacking patterns.",

Here we present new U-Pb and Re-Os geochronological constraints on Sturtian glacial deposits from Zambia, Arctic Alaska, Mongolia, South China, and throughout Laurentia. We present these new ages in stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical context to integrate data from other key localities, such as Namibia and Australia, and to construct a new age model for the Cryogenian Period. We find that there is no evidence for a global, pre-717 Ma glaciation. Instead, Sturtian glacial deposits appeared on all of these cratons by 717 Ma following widespread basaltic volcanism. We then review the nature and duration of the >50 Myr long Sturtian glacial epoch. In many localities, strata deposited during this interval are characterized by two massive diamictite units separated by diamictite-free, siliciclastic strata. These intervening clast-poor deposits are commonly interpreted to represent an interglacial period, however, alternatively they formed during a long-lived glaciation as newly rifted margins subsided and detached from the ice-grounding line. In the aftermath of the Sturtian glaciation, high sedimentation rates made up for lost time, and filled pent-up accommodation space, creating thick Cryogenian non-glacial interlude deposits on many margins. We discuss implications for geochemical cycles and the interpretation of carbon isotope anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Many hillslope processes - physical, chemical, and biological - depend on subsurface temperature and water availability. As the subsurface temperature field varies both in space and through climate cycles, the dominant processes of mobile regolith production and transport and the rate at which they act will vary. These processes include the chemical weathering of minerals, cracking of rocks through frost action and tree roots, presence and impact of vegetation on soil cohesion, location and activity of burrowing and trampling animals, frost creep, and solifluction. In order to explore the interplay between these processes across a landscape and over geologic time, we develop a pseudo-three-dimensional subsurface thermal model within the Landlab landscape evolution modeling framework, driven by an associated spatially explicit radiative surface boundary condition.\nWe begin with the analytical solution for conduction in a medium with uniform thermal properties and progress to a numerical model that acknowledges variable material properties, water content, and phase change. At the surface we incorporate spatial and temporal variations in incoming short-wave radiation due to elevation, latitude, aspect, shading and orbital variations. Outgoing long-wave radiation is taken to depend on the surface temperature and may be modified by allowing back-radiation from the atmosphere.\nWith these tools we target variations in regolith production and motion over the long timescales on which hillslopes evolve. We implement a basic parameterization of temperature-dependent chemical and physical weathering linked to mobile regolith generation. We incorporate multiple regolith transport processes including heave, creep, solifluction, tree throw, and animal burrowing. We incorporate material tracking to trace the chemical evolution of regolith as it moves downslope. Our intention is not to parameterize all operative processes, but to include sufficient detail to identify how the different processes interact. We address questions that include: What governs contrasts in process rate on pole-ward vs. equator-ward slopes? Under what conditions should we expect temporal transitions between transport-limited and weathering-limited erosion? How does the legacy of past climate impact later hillslope activity?",

            "abstract": "The pre-collisional convergence history of India and Eurasia displays highly variable convergence rates, including anomalously high rates of ~120-180 mm/a between ~70 and 50 Ma. As the subduction zone forces play a key role in driving plate tectonic understanding the subduction zone configuration in the Tethyan ocean is essential to understand the observed variation in convergence rates. It has long been established that two subduction systems existed between India and Eurasia since the break up of Gondwana: An intra oceanic subduction system (in the equatorial part of the ocean) and a continental subduction system on the southern Eurasian margin. As relicts of both subduction systems are now incorporated in the Himalayan and Tibetan collision zone, reconstruction of the pre-collisional geometry and the timing of the collision between India and the different subduction system is challenging. However, in recent years it has become increasingly more obvious that India likely originally collided with the intra oceanic subduction system first and only subsequently with the Eurasia margin (e.g., Aitchison et al., 2007 JGR, Bouilhol et al, 2013 EPSL). In this presentation, we summarize the geological evidence that allows us to reconstruct the configuration of the subduction system in the Tehtyan ocean and the timing of the India-Arc and India Eurasia collision. These constraints guide 3D subduction zone models that are used to evaluate the role of two subduction zones for the variable India-Eurasia Convergence rates. Model convergence rates of up to 140 mm/yr are in agreement with observed rates from 120 Ma to present, except for a short-lived spike in rate at ~62-66 Ma, which may be attributed to the Reunion plume. The end of anomalously fast convergence is due to the entry of buoyant Indian continental lithosphere into this intra-oceanic subduction zone at 50 Ma and not to the collision of India with Eurasia, which had little effect before 40 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of deep tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFE) have raised fundamental questions about the physics of quasidynamic rupture and the underlying fault zone processes. The presence of serpentinite at P-T conditions characteristic of deep tremor and LFE suggests that it may be an important element in complex fault slip, however, little is known about its hydrological and mechanical properties. Here, we report on experiments designed to investigate the frictional behavior of serpentinite recovered from outcrops (SO1 and SO2) and the SAFOD borehole (G27). XRD analyses reveal the presence of lizardite, kaolinite, talc and hydrotalcite in the SO1; lizardite, clinochlore and magnetite in SO2; and lizardite, quartz and calcite in G27. We powdered samples from intact blocks to a grain size <150 µm and sheared the resulting gouge in a double-direct shear configuration using a true triaxial deformation apparatus. Effective normal stress (σ’n = σn – Pp) was kept constant at values ranging from 2 to 40 MPa. Shear stress was applied via a constant load point displacement rate, and velocity was increased stepwise from 0.1 to 100 μm/s, after which a series of slide-hold-slides (SHS) were performed. We measured permeability normal to the shear direction and recovered samples for microstructural analysis. Mechanical strength varied from m=0.17 for SO1, m=0.33 for SO2 and m=0.53 for G27. Gouges exhibit an overall velocity strengthening behavior, with values approaching velocity neutral at the highest effective normal stress. SHS tests show positive healing rates for S02 and G27; whereas, SO1 samples exhibit zero or negative healing rates. Permeability decreases with increasing σ’n, with SO1 (k = 10-20m2) showing the lowest values. Microstructural observations revealed a well-developed R-Y-P fabric in SO1, which is not observed in SO2 and G27. We posit that the development of different shear fabrics controlled by mineralogy controls frictional and hydrological properties. In this context, when serpentinite is associated with other weak phyllosilicates minerals, at typical seismogenic depths, it can control the mode of failure along subduction zones and major plate boundary faults.",

They primarily occur in Peru and Bolivia (90%) with smaller glaciers scattered across the peaks in Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Specific glaciers in the range have been studied in great detail, such as Bolivia's Zongo glacier and Peru's Quelccaya Ice Cap, but few studies of glacier recession across the full range have been published. We previously assessed glacier recession between c1987 and c2006 using manual classification techniques on Landsat imagery. We have now updated that study to the present (2013/2014), and and have incorporated automated techniques using support vector machines. The update to present allows us to examine both the variability in recession rates, and the current state of overall recession.\nThe primary issues in completing this analysis are accounting for snow cover (which can otherwise be easily misidentified as glacier), and developing a robust and semi-automated methodology to process the large number of individual images required. To avoid confusion with transient snow, we analysed 2-3 clear images at each epoch, with minimal visually apparent snow or glacier, and only labelled as glacier those pixels that were classified as glacier in the clear portions of each image. To automate the processing, we used support vector machines, trained with the extensive data we have available from our previous manual classification work.\nOur previous work indicated an overall recession of approximately 30% (or 700 km2 of glacier area loss) between c1987 and c2006. We will present updated figures from our new analysis, extending to 2013/2014.",

A detailed depth-profile of the grain size in the mantle is, however, unknown. To explore the possible depth-dependence of grain size, we use models of coupled core-mantle evolution that include the dynamic effect of surface tectonic plates. We developed an algorithm for modelling: 1) the surface yield stress in a dynamically consistent manner, and 2) the diffusion creep, that is based on the following ingredients: vacancy diffusion in perovskite, depth-dependent grain size, temperature and pressure. This algorithm is able to provide a fit to a wide set of geodynamical observations. Time-dependent convection simulations reveal that the thermal evolution of the mantle is very sensitive to depth-variations in the grain size. We also explore the important feedbacks of thermal convection on the evolution of Earth's mantle rheology.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude and the rupture area of the Mw=8.2 April 1st, 2014 Pisagua earthquake suggests that northern Chile is still a mature seismic gap reaching the end of its megathrust cycle. The Pisagua earthquake exhibited foreshock activity with four Mw~6.4 earthquakes and an associated increase of seismicity offshore of Pisagua, that started on March 16th (Mw=6.7). The Pisagua area exhibits some tectonic singularities: (1) the crustal forearc deformation is seismically active; (2) it coincides with the influence zone related to the buoyant Iquique Ridge; and (3) it is also located at the maximum curvature of the Bolivian Orocline. Previous studies established the presence of abundant microseismicity in the upper part of the interplate contact, along some geometrical arrangements suggesting forearc fault-related seismicity. We analyzed the 2014 foreshock sequence using a 3D body wave velocity model obtained from the dense short period FONDECYT 1130071 and the broadband permanent IPOC networks. Although there is limited azimuthal coverage for the foreshock activity, it seems clear that most of them are located along the interplate contact. However, there were foreshocks also located along structures parallel to those that were previously identified eastward, almost perpendicular to the slab. Additionally, we invert regional moment tensors from full broadband waveforms to compute the best centroid depth of the foreshocks (Mw>4.5) recorded by the IPOC network. The centroid depth and focal mechanism agrees rather well with the spatial distribution of the located seismicity. Besides thrust faulting events occurred along the plate interface, shallow crustal events were also triggered within the overriding South America plate. After the 2010 Mw=8.8 Maule and 2011 Mw=9.3 Tohoku megathrust earthquakes, the activation of coastal forearc faults associated with intraplate shallow earthquakes (Mw~7) occurred, evidencing a relationship between the large earthquakes and the forearc faulting process. Considering that the 2014 Mw=8.2 earthquake did not fill the northern Chile seismic gap, and that there were foreshocks located in the offshore upper crust, we believe that there is an urgent need to understand not only the issues related to forearc-subduction deformation processes, but also to seismic hazard evaluations.",

As a consequence, rice grown on the flooded soils may take up arsenic and expose people eating the rice to this carcinogenic substance. Microbial activity will enhance or decrease the mobilization of arsenic depending on their metabolic pathways. Among the microbes naturally residing in the soil are denitrifying bacteria, sulfate reducers, metal reducers (Fe, Mn), arsenic reducers, methanogens, and fermenters, whose activity varies based on the presence of oxygen. The purpose of the experiment was to assess how different amendments affect the microbial activity and the arsenic mobilization during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism after flooding of naturally contaminated Cambodian soil.\nIn a batch experiment, we investigated how the relative metabolic rate of naturally occurring microbes could vary with different types of organic carbon. The experiment was designed to measure the effects of various sources of carbon (dried rice straw, charred rice straw, manure, and glucose) on the microbial activity and arsenic release in an arsenic-contaminated paddy soil from Cambodia under flooded conditions. All amendments were added based on the carbon content in order to add 0.036 g of carbon per vial. The soil was flooded with a 10mM TRIS buffer solution at pH 7.04 in airtight 25mL serum vials and kept at 25 °C. We prepared 14 replicates per treatment to sample both gas and solution. On each sampling point, the solution replicates were sampled destructively. The gas replicates continued on and were sampled for both gas and solution on the final day of the experiment.

            "abstract": "The coastal temperate bog forests of British Columbia, Canada, export high amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) relative to the global average. Little is known about the factors influencing the quantity and quality of DOM exported from these forests or the role of this terrestrially-derived DOM in near-shore marine ecosystems. The objectives of this study are to better understand patterns and controls of DOM being exported from bog forest watersheds and its potential role in near-shore marine ecosystems. In 2013, the Kwakshua Watershed Ecosystems Study at Hakai Beach Institute (Calvert Island, BC) began year-round routine collection and analysis of DOM, nutrients, and environmental variables (e.g. conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen) of freshwater grab samples from the outlets of seven watersheds draining directly to the ocean, as well as near-shore marine samples adjacent to freshwater outflows. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied across watersheds (mean= 11.45 mg L-1, sd± 4.22) and fluctuated synchronously with seasons and storm events. In general, higher DOC was associated with lower specific UV absorbance (SUVA254; mean= 4.59 L mg-1 m-1, sd± 0.55). The relationship between DOC and SUVA254 differed between watersheds, suggesting exports in DOM are regulated by individual watershed attributes (e.g. landscape classification, flow paths) as well as precipitation. We are using LiDAR and other remote sensing data to examine watershed controls on DOC export. At near-shore marine sites, coupled CTD (Conductivity Temperature Depth) and optical measures (e.g. spectral slopes, slope ratios (SR), EEMs), showed a clear freshwater DOM signature within the system following rainfall events. Ongoing work will explore the relationship between bog forest watershed attributes and DOM flux and composition, with implications for further studies on biogeochemical cycling, carbon budgets, marine food webs, and climate change.",

            "abstract": "At the macroscopic scale, where the e-folding distance of low-frequency electromagnetic fields in conductive geomaterials is much larger than the size of organized heterogeneities such as fracture sets or laminations that constitute the geologic texture therein, electrical properties can be conveniently approximated by a generalized 3x3 tensor σ. Less convenient, however, are the algorithmic consequences of this approximation in electromagnetic modeling of 3D induction methods for geophysical exploration. Previous efforts at modelling generalized anisotropy with finite differences on a staggered Cartesian grid (e.g. Weiss and Newman, 2002; Wang and Fang, 2001) are posed in terms of the electric field with its governing \"curl-curl\" equation and well-documented null-space issues at low induction numbers. In contrast, Weiss (2013) proposed an alternate full-physics formulation in terms of Lorenz-gauged magentic vector A and electric scalar Φ potentials (Project APhiD) that eliminates the troublesome curl-curl operator, with ultrabroadband examples drawn from geologies with scalar, isotropic conductivity over the frequency range 10-2-1010 Hz. Here, the anisotropic theory presented in Weiss (2013) is implemented with finite differences on a Cartesian grid.\nBriefly stated, in this theoretical approach the conductivity tensor σ is split in terms of a rotationally-invariant isotropic conductivity σ* = ⅓ Tr(σ) and the residual σ - σ*I. This splitting decomposes the resulting finite difference coefficient matrix K into the sum Kiso + Kaniso, where the Kiso term is the coefficient matrix for the isotropic medium σ*, thus enabling reuse of the various routines previously developed for computing matrix coefficients in the isotropic case. Treatment of anisotropy is algorithmically therefore restricted to computing the coefficients in the sparse matrix Kaniso consisting of simple inner products of (σ - σ*I) · (A-∇Φ) and their divergence. In keeping with the philosophy of economizing the compute resource footprint, the anisotropic finite difference algorithm is solved in a matrix-free formulation whereby coefficient matrices are computed as needed at each step of the iterative BiCG-STAB solver used to solve the finite difference system of equations.",

The beam-atmosphere interaction, while a scientific endeavor of its own, also provides key diagnostics for other experiments. We present results of Monte Carlo simulations of the interaction of a beam of relativistic electrons with the upper atmosphere as they are injected downwards from a notional high altitude (thermospheric / ionospheric) injection platform. The beam parameters, defined by realistic parameters of a compact linear accelerator, are used to create a distribution of thousands of electrons. Each electron is injected downwards from 300 km altitude towards the dense atmosphere, where it undergoes elastic and inelastic collisions, leading to secondary ionization, optical emissions, and X-rays via bremsstrahlung. Here we describe the Monte Carlo model and present calculations of diagnostic outputs, including optical emissions, X-ray fluxes, secondary ionization, and backscattered energetic electron fluxes. Optical emissions are propagated to the ground through the lower atmosphere, including the effects of atmospheric absorption and scattering, to estimate the brightness of the emission column for a given beam current and energy. Similarly, X-ray fluxes are propagated to hypothetical detectors on balloons and satellites, taking into account Compton scattering and photoabsorption. Secondary ionization is used to estimate the radar signal returns from various ground-based radar facilities. Finally, simulated backscattered electron fluxes are measured at the injection location. The simulation results show that for realizable accelerator parameters, each of these diagnostics should be readily detectable by appropriate instruments. ",

Here we report frequency and pressure dependences on elasticity when applying dynamic acousto-elasticity (DAE) of rock samples, analogous to quasi-static acousto-elasticity. DAE allows one to obtain the elastic behavior over the entire dynamic cycle, detailing the full nonlinear behavior under tension and compression, including hysteresis and memory effects. We perform DAE on a sample of Berea sandstone subject to 0.5MPa uniaxial load, with sinusoidal oscillating strain amplitudes ranging from 10-6 to 10-5 and at frequencies from 0.1 to 260Hz. In addition, the confining pressure is increased stepwise from 0 to 30MPa. We compare results to previous measurements made at lower (mHz) and higher (kHz) frequencies. Nonlinear elastic parameters corresponding to conditioning effects, third order elastic constants and fourth order elastic constants are quantitatively compared over the pressure and frequency ranges. We observe that the decrease in modulus due to conditioning increases with frequency, suggesting a frequency and/or strain-rate dependence that should be included in nonlinear elastic models of rocks. In agreement with previous measurements, nonlinear elastic effects also decrease with confining pressure, suggesting that nonlinear elastic sources such as micro-cracks, soft bonds and dislocations are turned off as the pressure increases.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we use a hierarchical modeling approach to investigate the influence of tropical air-sea feedbacks on climate impacts of aerosols in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We construct four different models by coupling the atmospheric component of CESM, the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM), to four different ocean models: (i) the Data Ocean Model (DOM; prescribed SST), (i) Slab Ocean Model (SOM; thermodynamic coupling), (iii) Reduced Gravity Ocean Model (RGOM; dynamic coupling), and (iv) the Parallel Ocean Program (POP; full ocean model). These four models represent progressively increasing degree of coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean. The RGOM model, in particular, is tuned to produce a good simulation of ENSO and the associated tropical air-sea interaction, without being impacted by the climate drifts exhibited by fully-coupled GCMs. For each method of coupling, a pair of numerical experiments, including present day (year 2000) and preindustrial (year 1850) sulfate aerosol loading, were carried out. Our results indicate that the inclusion of air-sea interaction has large impacts on the spatial structure of the climate response induced by aerosols. In response to sulfate aerosol forcing, ITCZ shifts southwards as a result of the anomalous clockwise MMC change which transports moisture southwardly across the Equator. We present analyses of the regional response to sulfate aerosol forcing in the equatorial Pacific as well as the zonally-averaged response. The decomposition of the change in the net surface energy flux shows the most dominant terms are net shortwave radiative flux at the surface and latent heat flux. Further analyses show all ocean model simulations simulate a positive change of northward atmospheric energy transport across the Equator in response to the perturbed radiative sulfate forcing. This positive northward atmospheric energy transport change plays a role in compensating partially cooling caused by sulfate aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Many attempts to assimilate precipitation observations in numerical models have been made, but they have resulted in little or no forecast improvement at the end of the precipitation assimilation. This is due to the nonlinearity of the model precipitation parameterization, the non-Gaussianity of precipitation variables, and the large and unknown model and observation errors.\nWe addressed these problems by using an EnKF (LETKF) that does not require linearization of Precipitation, and by Gaussian transformations of observed and model precipitation. In addition, several QC criteria were designed to reject precipitation observations that are not useful for the assimilation. OSSE experiments with the SPEEDY model, and a low-resolution version of the NCEP GFS was used to assimilate real TRMM/TMPA observations. Both the OSSEs and the real observation experiments gave encouraging results, indicating that both analyses and 5-day forecasts are improved by the assimilation of precipitation (Lien et al., 2013, Lien, 2014). For real observations, we found that it was necessary to apply quality control criteria to reject observations that are not useful for the assimilation. We found that the use of the ensemble forecast sensitivity to observations (EFSO) to analyze the effectiveness of precipitation assimilation gave results superior to the other QC methods. We plan to apply similar techniques to GPM precipitation observations in collaboration with Prof. Miyoshi of RIKEN, Japan.",

The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) has an abundance of natural seeps as well as numerous man-made structures that could provide a source of hydrocarbons to the water column. Samples of seawater were collected on the first GISR (Gulf Integrated Spill Research) cruise (G01) during the first week of July 2012. This cruise covered an area of ~1360 km2 roughly centered on the site of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Alkalinity profiles for the southeastern most stations indicate lower (~100 μmol/kg) alkalinities at depth when compared to other stations sampled. This results in calculated pHs that are ~0.5 units lower at depth than they are at the other stations. Another group of stations show increased DIC concentrations on the order of 100-150 μmol/kg higher than average at depths at 800 m and 1200 m leading to calculated pHs about 0.2 to 0.4 below average for those depths in all of the stations sampled. These features may or may not be persistent in this region, and the elevated DIC concentrations may be related to organic matter (petroleum or other) oxidation. Samples were collected from this same region 2 years later (June 2014) and the persistence of these features will be discussed in the context of linkages with organic carbon respiration and low pHs.",

            "abstract": "The development of next generation Earth System Models (ESM) demands fundamental configuration decisions across three axes of computational constraint: resolution, complexity and simulation length. One of the representational aspirations driving current development is to capture the global ocean mesoscale (i.e. ocean weather) in coupled carbon-climate ESMs. This resolution constraint poses extreme limitations on both complexity (i.e. the number of biogeochemical tracers) and simulation length. The present study explores a novel experimental design in which a series of touchstones across the axes of resolution (100 km to 10 km), complexity (30 tracer full biogeochemistry to 6, 3, and 1 tracer approximations), and simulation length (millenia to decades) are explored to estimate baseline biogeochemical simulation characteristics and the biogeochemical response to climate change. Along the axis of complexity, we find biogeochemical fidelity largely reproduced with a 6 tracer version of our full 30 tracer module, which is very promising for high resolution applications. However, further reduction down to 3 tracers revealed much more pronounced biases in baseline simulation characteristics. Further, we find critical differences in simulation characteristics in the 3 tracer version, across resolutions, that challenge mechanistic attribution. Although these deficiencies may reflect specific aspects of our 3 tracer model design and are the topic of further research for future improvement, they illustrate the great challenge of adequately representing the key processes with such a small number of tracers. Nonetheless, we find that sensitivity of the biogeochemistry to climate change across the complexity bear many similarities, giving us some support that the differences we see across resolutions may indicate robust differences in biogeochemical response across resolutions.",

The transformation of LOR waves on quasi-neutral density perturbations in the near field of an antenna gives rise to whistler waves on combination frequencies.

However, the Permo-Carboniferous apparent polar wander path (APWP) of South America, for which the overlap is the most severe, is dominated by sedimentary rocks and the few igneous rocks are either remagnetized or have suffered from tectonic rotations. Bilardello and Kodama (2010) have shown how inclination shallowing corrections of Gondwana sedimentary rocks may completely eliminate the continental overlap between the northern and southern continental blocks. Such blanket inclination corrections performed using a fixed flattening factor, however, lack a solid base because inclination shallowing is lithology-specific, depending on clay content, magnetic carrier, particle size and shape among other factors, and should not be performed systematically. New paleomagnetic data from the Permo-Carboniferous Itararé Group of Brazil reveal extensive remagnetizations in these rocks, as do recently published studies that also highlight pervasive South American remagnetizations which affect some of the paleopoles that define the Permo-Carboniferous portion of South American APWP. We present new paleomagnetic, rock-magnetic and anisotropy data from the Brazilian Itararé Group and also point out flaws in the widely used and inclination corrected South American Permo-Carboniferous APWP reported in Torsvik et al.

The seepage activity and the spatial distribution of the widespread emission sites encountered at this area are described by (Dupré et al. 2014).\nGas composition shows that methane is the dominant species compared to the C2+. The associated δ13C and δD signatures point to a biogenic origin- through CO2 reduction- of the gas.\nHelium concentrations are very low, ranging from 0.1 and 2.3 ppm, indicating a low residence time of the fluids in the subsurface. However, the resulting helium isotopic ratios are mostly crustal fingerprinted (around 0.02). The R/Ra values sometimes exhibit higher value of 0.2, indicative either an ASW (air saturated water) value, or the fingerprint of ancient mantle helium, the later in agreement with the geological structural context of the Parentis Basin.\nMost of the samples exhibit a mixing between ASW and air, probably by excess air addition to the initial ASW concentration. The elemental Ne/Ar ratio is remarkably constant for the totality of the samples, with a value typical of ASW (0.2). This result implies that the migrating gas phase is \"stripping\" the original water matrix from its noble gas content, as described by Gillfillian et al., 2008. This further indicates that an intermediate reservoir of biogenic gas should be present at depth.\nThe GAZCOGNE study is co-funded by TOTAL and IFREMER as part of the PAMELA (Passive Margin Exploration Laboratories) scientific project.\n",

            "abstract": "The 146Sm-142Nd (t1/2=68 Ma) chronometer can be used to examine silicate differentiation in the first 400 Ma of Earth history. Early fractionation between Sm and Nd is recorded in cratonic Archean rocks in their 142Nd/144Nd ratios that that deviate up to ±20 ppm, or µ142Nd - ppm deviation relative to the present-day convecting mantle at 0. These values likely record early extraction of incompatible trace element (ITE) enriched material with -µ142Nd, either as crust or late stage residual melt from a magma ocean, and resulting in a complimentary ITE depleted residual mantle with +µ142Nd. If this early-formed ITE-enriched material was re-incorporated rapidly back into the convecting mantle, both ITE-enriched and ITE-depleted mantle domains would have been established in the Hadean. Alternatively, if it was early-formed crust that remained stable it could have slowly eroded and progressively remixed into the convecting mantle as subducted sediment during the Archean. Each of these scenarios could potentially explain the decrease in the maximum variation in µ142Nd from ±20 at 4.0 Ga to 0 at 2.5 Ga [1,2,3]. In the scenario where these variations reflect mixing of mantle domains, this implies long mantle mixing times of greater than 1 Ga in the Archean in order to preserve the early-formed heterogeneities. This can be achieved in a stagnant lid tectonic regime in the Archean with sporadic and short subduction cycles [2]. This scenario would also indicate that mixing times in the convecting mantle were much slower than the previously proposed 100 Ma in the Hadean and Archean. In the alternative scenario, sediment with -µ142Nd was progressively mixed into the mantle via subduction in the Archean [3]. This scenario doesn’t require slow mantle mixing times or a stagnant-lid regime. It requires crustal resident times of up to 750 Ma to maintain a steady supply of ancient sediment recycling over the Archean. Each of these scenarios evoke very contrasting conditions for early Earth history and additional examination is needed. We will consider the geochemical consequences of crustal sediment subduction in order to test the hypothesis of crustal recycling as well as provide additional evidence to aid in resolving this issue.\n[1] Bennett et al., Science, 318 (2007), p.1907\n[2] Debaille et al., EPSL, 373 (2013), p.83\n[3] Roth et al., G3, 2014",

            "abstract": "Although short-term production of unconventional gas depends on the area of contact created by hydraulic fracturing and connections with pre-existing natural fracture networks, sustainable recovery is limited by transfer of gas from nanoporous matrix into the fractures, because the permeability of hydraulic fractures is orders of magnitude higher than that of the shale matrix. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of hydrocarbon mobility in shale matrix is urgently needed for improving recovery efficiencies. Shale transport properties (diffusivity, permeability, and electronic conductivity), which are critical for understanding the fundamental transport mechanisms, are still poorly understood. There have been some studies using experimental techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize the nanoscale structures of shale. Due to the ultra-low porosity and permeability, it is difficult to experimentally investigate the fundamental transport processes inside the shale or accurately measure the transport properties. Advanced pore-scale numerical methods, e.g., the lattice Boltzman method (LBM) may provide an alternative approach.\nIn the present study, three-dimensional nanoscale porous structures of shale are reconstructed based on SEM images of shale samples. Characterization analysis of the nanoscale reconstructed shale is performed, including determination of porosity, pore size distribution, specific surface area, and pore connectivity. The LBM flow model and diffusion model are adopted to simulate fluid flow and Knudsen diffusion in the reconstructed shale, respectively. Tortuosity, intrinsic permeability, and effective Knudsen diffusivity are numerically predicted. The tortuosity is much higher than what is commonly employed in Bruggeman equation. Correction of the intrinsic permeability by taking into consideration the contribution of Knudsen diffusion, which leads to the apparent permeability, is performed. The correction factor under different Knudsen number and pressure conditions are estimated and compared with existing corrections reported in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural nitrogen (N) is a legacy contaminant often found in shallow groundwater systems. This legacy has commonly been observed using well nests (vertical sampling) in recharge areas, but may also be observed by sampling at points in/beneath a streambed using pushable probes along transects across a channel (lateral sampling). We compared results from two different streambed point sampling approaches and from wells in the recharge area to assess whether the different approaches give fundamentally different pictures of (1) the magnitude of N contamination, (2) historic trends in N contamination, and (3) the extent to which denitrification attenuates nitrate transport through the surficial aquifer.\nTwo different arrangements of streambed points (SP) were used to sample groundwater discharging into a coastal plain stream in North Carolina. In July 2012, a 58 m reach was sampled using closely-spaced lateral transects of SP, revealing high average [NO3-] (808 µM, n=39). In March 2013, transects of SP were widely distributed through a 2.7 km reach that contained the 58 m reach and suggested overall lower [NO3-] (210 µM, n=30), possibly due to variation in land use along the longer study reach. Mean [NO3-] from vertical sampling (2 well nests with 3 wells each) was 296 µM. Groundwater apparent ages from SP in the 58 m and 2.7 km reaches suggested lower recharge [NO3-] (observed [NO3-] plus modeled excess N2) in 0-10 year-old water (1250 µM and 525 µM, respectively), compared to higher recharge [NO3-] from 10-30 years ago (about 1600 µM and 900 µM, respectively). In the wells, [NO3-] was highest (835 µM) in groundwater with apparent age of 12-15 years and declined as apparent age increased, a trend that was consistent with SP in the 2.7 km reach. The 58 m reach suggested elevated recharge [NO3-] (>1100 µM) over a 50-year period. Excess N2 from wells suggested that about 62% of nitrate had been removed via denitrification since recharge, versus 51% and 78% from SP in the 58 m and 2.7 km reaches, respectively. Groundwater mean transit times from SP were 26-31 years, similar to preliminary estimates from wells (24 years). The two approaches to streambed point sampling have different strengths and weaknesses compared to vertical sampling in the recharge area, but may be viable alternatives for future assessments of legacy N in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Some soil carbon datasets that are spatially rich, such as the USDA Forest Service Inventory and Analysis National Program dataset, sample soil to only 20 cm (8 inches), despite evidence that substantial stores of soil C can be found deeper in the soil profile. The maximum extent of tree rooting is typically many meters deep and provides: direct exchange with the soil solution; redistribution of water from deep horizons toward the surface during times of drought; resources for active microbial communities in deep soil around root channels; and direct carbon inputs through exudates and root turnover. This study examined soil carbon to a depth of 2.5 meters across 22 soils in Pacific Northwest Douglas-fir forests. Excavations at 20 additional sites took place in summer 2014, greatly expanding the spatial coverage and extent of the data set. Forest floor and mineral soil bulk density samples were collected at depths of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 meters. Pool estimates from systematic sampling depths shallower than 1.5 m yielded significantly smaller estimates than the total soil stock to 2.5 meters (P<0.01). On average, only 5% of soil C was found in the litter layer, 35% was found below 0.5 meter, and 21% was found below 1.0 meter. Due to the difficulty of excavating and measuring deep soil carbon, a series of nonlinear mixed effect models were fit to the data to predict deep soil carbon stocks given sampling to 1.0 meter. A model using an inverse polynomial function predicted soil carbon to 2.5 meters with -5.6% mean error. The largest errors occurred in Andisols with non-crystalline minerals, which can adsorb large quantities of carbon on mineral surfaces and preserve it from decomposition. An accurate spatial dataset of soil depth to bedrock would be extremely useful to constrain models of the vertical distribution of soil carbon. Efforts to represent carbon in spatial models would benefit from considering the vertical distribution of carbon in soil. Sampling deep soil will avoid biased estimates of soil carbon and create a more complete picture of soil pools and changes over time.",

This study reviewed the published studies from 160 large watersheds (>500 km2) in the world. Based on the Budyko’s Curve, E0/P (potential evapotranspiration/precipitation) is selected as the indicator for climate variability, while watershed area and vegetation cover change represent the watershed properties. Our meta-data analysis shows that the impacts of land cover change on water can be as important as the influence from climate change. In addition, hydrological sensitivity increases with E0/P (dryness index), which is different from the commonly-held perception (i.e., the sensitivity at E0/P = 1 is the highest). Large watersheds have the ability to buffer the effects of land cover change on water yield.

Creating a repository of the effects of past storms and other extreme weather events on society, together with documentation of the meteorological evolution of the events, will facilitate the NWS and other government agencies to analyze this data. Such analysis will improve their strategies, such as sharpening local and state responses to extreme weather and enhancing forecasts for the events, to create a more weather-ready society in Alaska. This research examines six high-impact weather events in Alaska, ranging in dates from 1974 until 2012. Atmospheric data was gathered from the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)’s 6-Hour National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Data Reanalysis Composites and from 3-Hour NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Composites. Reanalysis composites of sea-level pressure, temperature, geopotential height, and vector wind allowed for the storms to be tracked and for weather pattern anomalies to be recognized. Societal impacts were investigated by using the National Climactic Data Center (NCDC)’s online Storm Events Database and by utilizing microfilms of Alaskan newspapers detailing the events. Synthesizing facts from NCDC and newspapers, along with incorporating meteorological knowledge from the atmospheric reanalysis composites, summaries of the events could then be created. In the future, this research will be continued to include a broader range of high-impact Alaskan weather events. This work will further serve as a basis for analysis for decision-makers to better plan for extreme events and their aftermath. The completed research, though a small portion of the anticipated project, provides a template for future data assimilation, and it initiates the efforts towards a more weather-prepared Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet have attracted a great deal of attention in the scientific community with respect to their role in seasonal enhancements of ice flow velocities. Large amounts of meltwater generated at the surface can be efficiently delivered to the base of the ice sheet through hydro-fractured pathways beneath supraglacial lakes, potentially increasing basal sliding velocities. Therefore, assessments of surface meltwater volumes stored in and transported from supraglacial lakes to the englacial and subglacial systems are crucial for better coupling models of ice sheet hydrology and dynamics, particularly in response to a warming climate.\nSeveral physically-based and empirical passive remote sensing techniques based on MODIS, ASTER, Landsat measurements have been proposed to derive bathymetric information over supraglacial lakes. While unvalidated, most of the techniques have been calibrated against limited in-situ observations and yet have been applied across large regions of the ablation region. In this study, we investigate the validity of such techniques, specifically developed for MODIS, Landsat and WorldView-2 instruments. To make such an assessment, we calibrate the depth-retrieval models by using water-leaving radiances over lakes captured by a specific sensor early in the melt season, and depth measurements from a high resolution WV-2 DEM over the same lakes when devoid of water. Having applied calibrated models over lakes (validation dataset), we then compare the modeled depths against observations derived from the after-drainage DEM of the area. Our primary study site is located in a portion of the ablation region of the GrIS with its center situated at 67o 18’ N, 48o 55’ W at approximately 1200 m A.S.L[1]. Initial results from the study specifically point to the capability of WV-2 multispectral measurements in calculating lake depths with a high degree of accuracy (bias< 2% of mean depth) and precision (RMSE< 12% of mean depth) and an average volumetric error of 6%. Through analyzing MODIS and Landsat measurements over the same lake region, this work will improve the currently-used techniques by allowing calibration/validation over larger areas and will better quantify the errors and uncertainties in lake storage assessments made thus far.\n\n[1] Above Sea Level",

            "abstract": "The physical architecture of a landscape, as recorded in topography, is a major factor driving the spatial distribution of river habitat within a catchment. For this reason, predictive geomorphic models for fluvial characteristics, particularly grain size, have been suggested as possible contributors to salmonid habitat identification efforts. However, to our knowledge, no work has been done to both implement geomorphic predictions of reach-scale grain size and then test those predictions with salmonid habitat use data. We present a physically-based, empirically calibrated approach to predicting grain size distributions from high resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-derived topographic data. This approach builds on previous efforts in that it predicts the full grain size distribution, rather than just median grain size, and incorporates an empirically calibrated shear stress partitioning factor. We use the predicted grain size distributions to calculate the fraction of the bed area movable by salmon of a given size, which we then compare to 7 years of steelhead trout and coho salmon spawning survey data for a 77 km2 watershed along the central California Coast. We find that grain size explains the paucity of spawning in the upper reaches of the drainage, but does not explain variation within the mainstem. In order to explain the residuals in spawning within the mainstem, we turn to the spacing of riffle bedforms. Field surveys of riffle spacing explain 64% of the variation in spawning in these reaches, suggesting that spawning is ultimately limited by the availability of riffles. Because riffle spacing varies systematically with channel width, we show that predicting riffle spacing is feasible with LiDAR data. Taken together, these findings highlight both the value and limitations of a grain-size focused approach to habitat prediction, and suggest that such approaches should be used in concert with predictions of channel bed morphology.",

Most of these datasets were archived in online data repositories in order to facilitate later analysis. However, the diversity of proxy types and heterogeneous reporting standards have hindered the analysis of globally distributed paleoceanographic time series, despite the tremendous potential utility of large datasets. In order for the existing archives of paleoceanographic data to contribute towards important unanswered issues, the datasets must be readily accessible in an organized structure, with an appropriate unified age model for each sediment site.\nHere we present a comprehensive database, built using MATLAB structure, for the most commonly measured proxies in marine sediment cores and surface sediment. These include the concentrations of carbonate, organic matter and opal, density of the sediment, the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of benthic and planktonic foraminifera, sea surface temperature estimates, as well as chronological constrains. The records were downloaded from PANGAEA and NOAA databases and multiple records from the same sediment core were regrouped, allowing age models to be shared between records. The resulting database consists of more than 30,000 sites, facilitating rapid and accurate mapping of sediment composition for selected time periods, and retrieving and plotting time series.\nThe greatest hurdle identified in building a unifi­ed dataproduct of this type is inconsistency in the reporting of depth measurements and chronological information.\nIn our view, standardized reporting practices would greatly assist in developing global quantitative analysis, and requires community-wide action. We propose the development of a unified global sediment core registry, including metadata and chronological information for all marine sediment cores.\nFrom this global database, we calculated changes in sedimentary mass accumulation rates for carbonate and organic carbon over the last deglaciation using hundreds of sediment cores. By comparing these with modern maps of carbonates and organic carbon burial, we evaluated the variations of carbon across the last deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "The Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) \"ribbon\" is a unique feature of enhanced energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux encircling the sky. Ever since its discovery, numerous interpretations have been proposed to explain the ribbon's existence, with sophisticated models and simulations attempting to explain key characteristics of the ribbon, including its intensity, spatial and spectral structure, and evolution over time. Although the ribbon's origin is still unknown, the leading theory is the so-called \"secondary ENA\" mechanism, in which primary ENAs from inside the heliosphere undergo two charge-exchange events outside the heliopause, producing secondary ENAs which may come back inside the heliosphere and be detected by IBEX. While the leading hypothesis for the generation of the ribbon (\"secondary ENA\" mechanism) appears to explain several key characteristics, modeling efforts are becoming under-constrained by current measurement capabilities. In this talk, I present an analysis of key measurement parameters needed to test and differentiate hypotheses of the ribbon in models and simulations (e.g., spectral range and resolution, angular resolution, and temporal baseline of observations). Understanding these parameters and their importance for identifying and interpreting the physical processes that generate the ribbon are critical for the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP).",

            "abstract": "Relationships between cumulative fault displacement, slip rate and length, along with fault population statistics are analyzed for faults located within the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ), focusing on areas north of the Garlock fault. Here many faults are geologically young and in an early stage of evolution, while many older and larger faults are also still active. We analyze scaling relationships for both strike-slip and normal faults in order to determine whether the two fault populations share the same properties or not. Cumulative displacement, slip rate and length data are collected from published maps and literature sources. The dataset spans fault lengths from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers. Results of fault scaling analyses indicate that displacement has a linear relationship with fault length for normal faults in this area over the entire length span, whereas strike-slip faults do not have a clear displacement-length scaling relation. For a given length, the subset of strike-slip faults typically exhibits a much larger displacement than that for the normal faults. The slip rate versus length trends are similar but are considerably more scattered. In addition, we define a subpopulation of normal faults that are kinematically related to the right-lateral strike-slip faults; these have a maximum length set by the spacing between the right-lateral faults. Fault size-frequency distributions also indicate differences between the normal and strike-slip fault populations. Overall, the normal faults have higher ratios of cumulative number to fault length than the strike-slip population does, which we relate to different patterns of localization of faulting. We interpret these trends as reflecting different tectonic histories, with the majority of normal faults being intraplate faults associated with Basin and Range extension and the strike-slip faults being kinematically connected with plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "With increasing risk of dangerous climate change geoengineering solutions to Earth’s climate problems have attracted much attention. One proposed geoengineering approach considers the use of ocean pipes as a means to increase ocean carbon uptake and the storage of thermal energy in the deep ocean. We use a latest generation Earth System Model (ESM) to perform simulations of idealised extreme implementations of ocean pipes. In our simulations, downward transport of thermal energy by ocean pipes strongly cools the near surface atmosphere – by up to 11°C on a global mean. The ocean pipes cause net thermal energy to be transported from the terrestrial environment to the deep ocean while increasing the global net transport of water to land. By cooling the ocean surface more than the land, ocean pipes tend to promote a monsoonal-type circulation, resulting in increased water vapour transport to land. Throughout their implementation, ocean pipes prevent energy from escaping to space, increasing the amount of energy stored in Earth’s climate system despite reductions in surface temperature. As a consequence, our results indicate that an abrupt termination of ocean pipes could cause dramatic increases in surface temperatures beyond that which would have been obtained had ocean pipes not been implemented.",

            "abstract": "The chemical variability of chondrule volatile element contents provide a wealth of information on the processes that shaped the early solar system and its compositional heterogeneity. An essential observation is that chondrule melts contain very low alkalies and other volatile elements (e.g., Cl). The reason for this depletion is the combined effects of cooling rates (10 to 1000K/h), the small size of chondrules, and their high melting temperatures (~1700 to 2100 K) resulting in extensive loss of volatiles at canonical pressures (e.g., 10-4bar). However, we observe some chondrules with significant concentrations of volatiles (Na, Cl), that differ markedly from chondrules dominated by refractory elements. Could such heterogeneity arise from loss of alkalis and Cl to a gas phase that itself later condenses, thereby yielding variations in volatile enrichments in chondrules? Does Cl enhance volatility of the alkalis to varying extents?\nExperiments on Cl-bearing and Cl-free melts of equivalent composition for 10 min, 4 h, and 6 h reveal systematic effects of Cl on alkali volatility. Cl-bearing melts lose 48% of initial Na2O, 66% of K2O, 96% of Cl within the first 10 minutes of degassing. Then the amount of alkali loss decreases due to the absence of Cl. Cl-free melts loses only 15% of initial Na2O and 33% K2O. After 4 hours, melts lose 1/3 of initial Na2O and 1/2 of K2O. For both systems, Na2O is more compatible in the melt relative to K2O. Therefore, the vapor given off has a K/Na ratio higher than the melt through time in spite of the much higher initial Na abundance in the melt. Enhanced vaporization of alkalis from Cl-bearing melt suggests that Na and K evaporate more readily as volatile chlorides than as monatomic gases. Cl-free initial melts with normative plagioclase of An50Ab44Or6 evolved into slightly normal zoned ones (An49Ab50Or1) while Cl-bearing initial melts normative to albitic plagioclase (An46Ab50Or4) evolved to reverse zoned ones (An54Ab45Or1). The vapor phase over Cl-bearing chondrule melts may have a bimodal character over time. The heteregeneous volatile contents of chondrules may result from quenching of melt droplets at different stages of repeated heating, chondrule fragment recycling, and recondensation of exsolved volatiles.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations on the Fraser Delta slope (British Columbia, Canada) confirm that unconfined turbidity currents occur on the delta slope close to the mouth of the main river channel. However the conditions that trigger these events are not understood. This study attempts to characterize the triggering conditions using data from the Delta Dynamics Laboratory (DDL), part of the VENUS Coastal Network in the Ocean Networks Canada Observatory, collected over four years. Data collection focused on the freshet season (May-July), a period believed to have the highest occurrence of submarine sediment density flows due to a high river discharge from snow melt combined with high tidal excursions resuspending bottom sediment. ADCP backscatter profiles reveal sediment settling through the water column from the river plume to the delta slope during ebb tide when the salt wedge is likely pushed out of the river channel and into the basin. Combined with measurements of tidal excursions and Fraser River discharge, quantitative measurements of the sediment settling process were analyzed on a daily and seasonal time scale. It is found that while sediment settling events occur throughout the entire year, the most intense and longest duration events occur on a higher frequency during the freshet season. In addition, the intensity of the ADCP backscatter has a strong positive correlation with the height of the major tide each day. This suggests that the tidal excursion has a larger direct control on the near bottom sediment concentration the delta slope than the river discharge. Continuous data collection is able to capture a clearer picture of the conditions in which submarine sediment density flows are created. From this, the aim is to produce more accurate predictions of when and where the flows will occur. With this information, improved geohazard monitoring on delta slopes can be achieved.",

A test area was selected in the north-eastern sector of Sicily (southern Italy), corresponding to the catchments of the Briga and the Giampilieri streams both stretching for few kilometres from the Peloritan ridge (eastern Sicily, Italy) to the Ionian sea. This area was struck on the 1st October 2009 by an extreme climatic event resulting in thousands of rapid shallow landslides, mainly of debris flows and debris avalanches types involving the weathered layer of a low to high grade metamorphic bedrock.\nExploiting the same set of predictors and the 2009 landslide archive, BLR- and BRT-based susceptibility models were obtained for the two catchments separately, adopting a random partition (RP) technique for validation; besides, the models trained in one of the two catchments (Briga) were tested in predicting the landslide distribution in the other (Giampilieri), adopting a spatial partition (SP) based validation procedure. All the validation procedures were based on multi-folds tests so to evaluate and compare the reliability of the fitting, the prediction skill, the coherence in the predictor selection and the precision of the susceptibility estimates.\nAll the obtained models for the two methods produced very high predictive performances, with a general congruence between BLR and BRT in the predictor importance. In particular, the research highlighted that BRT-models reached a higher prediction performance with respect to BLR-models, for RP based modelling, whilst for the SP-based models the difference in predictive skills between the two methods dropped drastically, converging to an analogous excellent performance. However, when looking at the precision of the probability estimates, BLR demonstrated to produce more robust models in terms of selected predictors and coefficients, as well as of dispersion of the estimated probabilities around the mean value for each mapped pixel.\nThe difference in the behaviour could be interpreted as the result of overfitting effects, which heavily affect decision tree classification more than logistic regression techniques.",

The sensor was launched on June 10, 2011 as part of the Aquarius/SAC-D mission and has been collecting data since August 25, 2011. Version 3 of the data product was released in June 2014 and provides a major milestone towards reaching the mission requirement of 0.2 psu.\nThis presentation reports the status of the Aquarius salinity retrieval algorithm highlighting the advances that have been made for and since the Version 3 release. The most important ones are:\n1) An improved surface roughness correction that is based on Aquarius scatterometer observations;\n2) A reduction in ascending/descending differences due to galactic background radiation reflected from the ocean surface; 3) A refinement of the quality control flags and masks that indicate degradation under certain environmental conditions. The Aquarius salinity algorithm also retrieves wind speed as part of the roughness correction with an accuracy comparable to the products from other satellites such as WindSat, SSMIS, ASCAT, and QuikSCAT.\nValidation of the salinity retrievals is accomplished using measurements from ARGO drifters measuring at 5 m depth and in the tropics also from moored buoys measuring at 1 m depth which are co-located with the nearest Aquarius footprint. In the most recent work an effort has also been made to identify areas with frequent rain to isolate potential issues with rain freshening in the upper ocean layer. Results in rain-free regions indicate that on monthly basis and 150 km grid, the V3 Aquarius salinity maps have an accuracy of about 0.13 psu in the tropics and 0.22 psu globally. Comparing Aquarius with ARGO and moored buoy salinity measurements during and after rain events permits a quantitative assessment of the effect of salinity stratification within the first 5 m of the upper ocean layer.",

Myria's internal model of computation is the relational algebra extended with iteration, such that every program is inherently data-parallel, just as every query in a database is inherently data-parallel. But unlike databases, iteration is a first class concept, allowing us to express machine learning tasks, graph traversal tasks, and more. Programs can be expressed in a number of languages and can be executed on a number of execution environments, but we emphasize a particular language called MyriaL that supports both imperative and declarative styles and a particular execution engine called MyriaX that uses an in-memory column-oriented representation and asynchronous iteration. We deliver Myria over the web as a service, providing an editor, performance analysis tools, and catalog browsing features in a single environment. We find that this web-based \"delivery vector\" is critical in reaching non-experts: they are insulated from irrelevant effort technical work associated with installation, configuration, and resource management. The MyriaX backend, one of several execution runtimes we support, is a main-memory, column-oriented, RDBMS-on-the-worker system that supports cyclic data flows as a first-class citizen and has been shown to outperform competitive systems on 100-machine cluster sizes.

            "abstract": "Recent tomographic models show that while many slabs seem to deflect or stagnate at the 660 km discontinuity, some slabs continue to subduct deeper and pond at 1000 km below the earth's surface (Fukao and Obayashi, 2013). Only one slab is observed to penetrate significantly deeper into the mantle. Furthermore, some mantle upwellings also appear to be deflected at 1000 km in depth. The radial correlation functions for the low-order spherical harmonics of most tomographic inversions show that while seismic wave velocities are correlated for all depths below ~1000 km, velocities at depths between 400–1000 km are uncorrelated with velocities at any other depth. This implies that there are large scale velocity features coherent from 1000 km to the core-mantle boundary, but no large scale features coherent from the top of the transition zone down to 1000 km. Seismic studies using precursors and receiver functions find evidence for numerous reflectors in the mid-mantle, ranging from 900 km in depth beneath the southern Pacific and southeast Asia to 1200 km beneath Europe and Japan. This range of depths could indicate topography along a single laterally continuous discontinuity or result from multiple unconnected features. Some reflectors are geographically near, and therefore may be associated with, subducted slabs, however the origin of the others is unclear. The 1000 km 'discontinuity' could potentially be explained by an increase in viscosity or density, such as a compositional difference in the mantle below this depth.\nWe use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the diversity in apparent slab stagnation behavior and which geophysical mechanisms prevent subduction into the lower mantle. The controlling factor may be a function of the slab itself, including subduction rate, trench rollback, composition, or temperature. Alternatively, bulk mantle properties may control slab penetration. We perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations to determine the influence of viscosity on stab stagnation and flow. We also explore the influence of a density jump at 1000 km. Finally, we generate theoretical seismograms for various velocity and density jumps in the mid mantle, and compare to seismic observations.

The presence of these cements causes very rough fracture walls that can constrict flow and hinder the connectivity between the fracture and matrix/fracture pores thereby reducing porosity and permeability.\nIn order to accurately predict fluid transport in unconventional reservoirs, we study the influence of diagenesis, numerical cement and fracture roughness on flow in three different fractures: a carbonate outcrop from the Niobrara formation; and two distinct sandstones, from a core from the Travis Peak and an outcrop from the Torridonian. We use x-ray microtomography imaging to provide information on fracture geometry. Image analysis and characterization of the connectivity and geometric tortuosity of the pore space and individual fluid phases at different saturations, is performed via ImageJ and 3DMA Rock software. We also use a combination of the level-set-method-based progressive-quasistatic algorithm (LSMPQS software), and lattice Boltzmann simulation (Palabos software) to characterize the capillary dominated displacement properties, absolute permeability and relative permeability of the naturally cemented fractures within. In addition, we numerically investigate the effect of (uniform) cementation on the fracture permeability as well as the tortuosity of the pore space and the capillary pressure-water saturation (Pc-Sw) relationship in the Niobrara. Finally, we create 3D prints of the fractures for visualization purposes.\nPermeability estimates in the studied fractures vary by several orders of magnitude when computed with the different correlations that currently exist in the literature. The presence of cements increases the geometric tortuosity of the pore space and capillary pressure while reducing the permeability. Contrary to our expectation, the tortuosity of the wetting and non-wetting phases and their respective relative permeabilities show no clear correlation.",

Multifractals has become a standard tool to analyze and simulate this key phenomenon for scalar fields. However, fields of interest, e.g. the velocity and the magnetic fields are vector fields. Some time ago, \"Lie cascades\" were introduced to deal with such fields by considering exponentiation from a stochastic element of a Lie algebra to its corresponding Lie group of transformations. The concerned transformation corresponds to the fine graining/downscaling of the field to higher and higher resolution. Unfortunately, developments were paused due to the possible large number of degrees of freedom of the latter, in particular with respect to the information that can be easily extracted from a d-dimensional vector field. In short, some physics was missing.\nIn this communication, we point out the interest of the Clifford algebra Clp,q to make concrete progress. Ironically, these algebra were mentioned at once as rather straightforward generalizations of the scalar complex cascades, but they were not investigated. On the contrary, the particular case of the \"pseudo-quaternions\" l(2,R)=Cl2,0=Cl1,1 has been often used to generate generalized scales to analyse and simulate anistropic scaling (scalar) fields. The latter is in fact illustrative of the basic property of the Clifford algebra $Cl_{p,q}$ to be generated by a quadratic form $Q$ whose signature ($p,q$) is fundamental.",

            "abstract": "High Arctic tundra landscapes are underlain by globally significant pools of ancient carbon (C) in the form of permafrost that today is beginning to thaw, as evidenced by deepening active layers. The degree to which this ancient C is diffusing as CO2 into the modern atmosphere during winter is a key climate feedback uncertainty today. Quantifying the magnitude and patterns of these ancient CO2 emission are critical as we begin to fully understand how, as a consequences of climate changes, these emissions might increase even further, accelerating the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and thus global temperatures. In order to do so, we measured fall and winter ecosystem respiration, soil pore space CO2 concentrations and bulk soil C at different depths along with their radiocarbon (14C) contents under ambient and experimentally manipulated deeper snow conditions in mesic tundra of Svalbard, in Adventdalen. Abiotic parameters such as air and soil temperature and water content were continuously monitored for the entire study period.\nOur findings reveal that: a) soils in these landscapes have permafrost that is up to 25,000 years old at 1.5 m depth; b) in late fall, once plants are dormant, CO2 emissions are dominated by ancient C with older values under deeper snow conditions c) that respiration rates are higher in winter under deeper snow, due to soils being up to 8oC warmer than ambient conditions; d) winter emissions of respired CO2 are dominated by ancient C at all times with effect of snow depth. For the first time our results show that ancient C, previously disconnected from the C cycle, is continuously emitted into the atmosphere during the long High Arctic winter. This new biosphere-atmosphere C cycle interaction may accelerate over time as permafrost active layers continue to deepen, increasing the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere, further distributing global temperatures and leading to subsequent changes in the Arctic and global climates. Our findings are integrated into a synthetic High Arctic annual cycle model of the ages and rates of CO2 emissions from the northerly most landscapes on earth.",

            "abstract": "Constraining moment deficit rates on crustal faults using geodetic data is currently an under-utilized but powerful method for estimating the potential seismic hazard presented by crustal faults. Two previous approaches to moment-bounding, bootstrapping and Metropolis-Hastings sampling, can both fail catastrophically when estimating the probability distribution of moment given data, p(Mo|d). Straightforward application of traditional Metropolis-Hastings sampling with uniform prior probabilities on slip leads to a mesh-dependent estimate of moment with a variance inversely related to the number of model elements. Moment thus estimated exhibits an “effective prior” on p(MO) that tends toward a delta function halfway between the bounds as the fault discretization becomes finer! Thus, it is incorrect to estimate the uncertainty in moment directly from the uncertainty in slip. Bootstrapping can produce optimistic bounds and give biased results. A third approach is functional moment bounding (FMB), which obtains bounds on moment by minimizing the data misfit over slip for all possible values of Mo and accepting only those values with a total misfit less than some threshold. We present a modified version of this method that creates a probability distribution function on Mo from the misfit and uses this pdf to obtain confidence bounds. We also present a fourth method that we term Probabilistic Moment Bounding (PMB) that we derive within a Bayesian framework and incorporate a smoothed slip prior. Both of these approaches produce conservative results and do not exhibit mesh dependence. We compare the results from FMB and PMB to those obtained from other methods and assess the results.",

            "abstract": "To address how natural disturbance, forest harvest, and deforestation from reservoir creation affect landscape-level carbon (C) budgets, a retrospective C budget for the 8500 ha Sooke watershed from 1911 - 2012 was developed using historic spatial inventory and disturbance data. Data was input to a spatially-explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model-Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), an inventory-based C budget model used to simulate forest C dynamics at multiple scales. In 1911 the watershed was dominated by mature/old Douglas-fir forests with aboveground biomass C (ABC) of 262 Mg C/ha and net ecosystem production (NEP) of 0.63 Mg C/ha/yr. Land was cleared around Sooke Lake, a dam built and lake expanded from 370 to 450 ha in 1915, 610 ha in 1970, 670 ha in 1980 and 810 ha in 2002. Along with deforestation, fires and localized harvest occurred from 1920 - 1940, reducing ABC to 189 Mg C/ha, with NEP varying from -1.63 to 0.13 Mg C/ha/yr. Distributed harvest occurred 1954 - 1998, with a minimum ABC of 148 Mg C/ha in 1991. By 2012 ABC (177 Mg C/ha) and NEP (2.29 Mg C/ha/yr) had increased. Over 100 years, 2430 ha forest was cut and replanted and 640 ha deforested. CBM-CFS3 includes transfers of dissolved organic C (DOC) to aquatic systems, however data has not been available to parameterize DOC flux. DOC fluxes are modelled as a fraction of decay loss from humified soil C with a default of 100% of losses to CO2 and 0% to DOC. Stream flow and [DOC] data from 1996 - 2012 for 3 watershed catchments, Rithet, Judge and Council were used to estimate annual DOC fluxes. Rithet, Judge and Council differed both in area % disturbed (logging or fire) over 100 years (39%, 93%, 91%) and in area % mature/old forest (>80yrs in 2012) (67%, 56%, 21%). DOC flux for Rithet and Judge ranged from 0.037 - 0.057 Mg C/ha/yr, Council averaged 0.017 Mg C/ha/yr. Low DOC fluxes were likely due to influences of a small lake in the catchment. Constraining CBM-CFS3 to observed DOC fluxes, required parameterization of humified C losses of 5.5 - 6.5% to DOC for Rithet and Judge, 2.5% to DOC for Council. All other catchments were assigned a fraction loss to DOC based on physiographic similarities to the 3 gauged catchments and the watershed C budget recalculated. Assuming none of the exported terrestrial DOC was respired to CO2, over 100 years up to 30640 Mg C may have been sequestered in sediment.",

A complete picture of the solar nebula and solar system formation cannot be confidently formulated until representatives of this group of bodies at the edge of solar space have been examined. The Pluto system is composed of unique, lunar- and intermediate-sized objects that can tell us much about how objects with volatile icy compositions evolve. Modeling of the interior suggests that geologic activity may have been significant to some degree, and observations of frost on the surface could imply the need for a geologic reservoir for the replenishment of these phases. However, these putative indicators of Pluto's geologic history are inconclusive and unspecific. Detailed examination of Pluto's geologic record is the only plausible means of bridging the gap between theory and observation. In this talk I will examine the potential importance of these tentative indications of geologic activity and how specific spacecraft observations have been designed and used to constrain the Pluto system’s geologic history. The cameras of New Horizons will provide robust data sets that should be immanently amenable to geological analysis of the Pluto system’s landscapes. In this talk, we begin with a brief discussion of the planned observations by the New Horizons cameras that will bear most directly on geological interpretability. Then I will broadly review major geological processes that could potentially operate on the surfaces of Pluto and its moons. I will first survey exogenic processes (i.e., those for which energy for surface modification is supplied externally to the planetary surface): impact cratering, sedimentary processes (including volatile migration), and the work of wind. I will conclude with an assessment of the prospects for endogenic activity in the form of tectonics and cryovolcanism.",

            "abstract": "Control of watershed nutrient input has long been a priority of Chesapeake Bay watershed management for alleviating hypoxia in the Bay. Therefore, systematic evaluations of historical watershed nutrient inputs and responses of river water quality can help managers to assess the effectiveness of nutrient management across the Bay watershed. Toward that end, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of multi-decadal total nitrogen (TN) watershed input and riverine output for the nine major rivers in the non-tidal Bay watershed. Specifically, we (1) compiled available data regarding multi-decadal TN input from four major sources, (2) obtained updated estimates of TN flux at downstream (edge-of-tide) river locations (‘output’), and (3) used these inputs and outputs to quantify the watersheds’ land/river effectiveness (LRE) factors in regard to TN assimilation, including an investigation of relationships between LRE and TN input. Our compiled data for N sources confirmed known trends regarding the two largest of the four TN sources (atmospheric deposition and fertilizer loadings) – i.e., that the former has declined significantly in all river basins, whereas the latter has decreased in most of the river basins. For the other two sources, point sources have declined most dramatically in the Patuxent River but exhibited various trends in other basins, whereas manure sources have increased statistically significantly in most of the river basins. The riverine output results were observed to follow watershed inputs in a non-linear manner. Finally, the LRE of the various basins were observed to correlate inversely with the watersheds’ input loadings, whereas temporal correlations within a given basin were less consistent. In addition, the Susquehanna sub-watersheds show lower LREs compared with other river basins, with riverine output similar to or even larger than input, implying that greater management effort at these locations could be especially fruitful for load reduction.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary GCMs exhibit a number of systematic errors in their simulations of cloud properties, as recently documented in Klein et al. (2013): Models do not simulate large enough total cloud fraction, especially over regions of marine stratocumulus on the eastern sides of subtropical ocean basins and throughout the midlatitudes over both ocean and land. Models also produce an over-­‐abundance of thick cloud (optical depth > 23) and an under-­‐abundance of thin cloud (optical depth < 23). It is important to determine the extent to which these biases are due to errors in model physics or due to errors in the simulated large-­‐scale ocean-­‐atmosphere state, as different causes require different solutions. Here we make use of novel simulations in which several CMIP5 GCMs are run in weather forecast mode as part of the Transpose-­AMIP II experiment. As each hindcast is initialized from the operational ECMWF YOTC analysis, large-­scale states remain very close to observations within a few days of model integration. Therefore, errors in the cloud fields with respect to instantaneous ISCCP observations can be largely attributed to model physics errors that arise relatively quickly in the simulations. We find that many of the systematic cloud biases identified in Klein et al. (2013) emerge within the first few days of these T-­AMIP hindcasts, indicating that errors in model physics are the dominant driver of the cloud biases. Using cloud radiative kernels designed specifically for the T-­AMIP runs, we quantify the relative importance of biases in cloud amount, altitude, and optical depth in driving errors in TOA radiation, focusing on key regions including Northern Hemisphere land areas where large summertime TOA SW radiation biases contribute to large warm biases at the surface.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-­‐AC52-­‐07NA27344.

            "abstract": "Based on tomography, geochemical and petrological evidences, a mantle plume called Hainan Plume has been suggested lying under Hainan Island. Our recent studies on basin subsidence and surface topography indicated that there existed surface vertical motion response to the suggested mantle plume. Post-rift rapid subsidence in the Qiongdongnan basin, which lies south of Hainan Island, is well known and accepted phenomenon. A particular feature is that the rapid subsidence did not just follow the end of syn-rift phase at ~ 21 Ma, but began after a ~10 my relatively tectonic quiescence. Different tectonic processes have been proposed to account for this rapid subsidence event. However, all these proposed mechanisms just focus on the rapid subsidence episode since Late Miocene. Our details subsidence analyses show that its tectonic subsidence is of a two-stage anomalous character: the deficit subsidence at the end of the syn-rift phase and the well known post-rift rapid subsidence after 10.5 Ma. Numerical analyses show that the stretching factor βs based on syn-rift sequences is much less than the observed crustal stretching factor βc, and the present basement depth can be almost predictable if assuming that the lithosphere was thinned with stretching factor βc; The crustal thinning happened during the syn-rift phase (before 21 Ma), and a new rifting and lower crustal flow after 21 Ma were not supported, proposing further that the syn-rift subsidence is deficit. Our further analyses proposed that the syn-rift subsidence deficit might be caused by the dynamic support of the secondary plume, and the post-rift rapid subsidence might result from the losing support of the thermal source decaying, therefore occurred to compensate the subsidence deficit of the syn-rift phase. The cooling history of the southern Hainan deduced by low temperature chronometry data, also indicated there exist an uplift event in the Late Oligocene (Shi et al., 2011). All the samples show that there is a Late Oligocene rapid uplift and cooling episode in the Southern Hainan. It is hard to explain the rapid cooling (uplift) episode in the eastern rim of the Hainan since there are no big faults close to the eastern Hainan. The deficit subsidence and uplift event might be the surface response to the deep thermal anomaly.",

            "abstract": "Biomass losses in tropical forests due to rising temperatures could accelerate regional and global climate change via reduced land-surface feedbacks associated with the carbon cycle. However, the response of tropical vegetation to such increased temperatures is highly uncertain. Current vegetation models may fail to capture resilience in plant response as they do not appropriately account for photosynthetic acclimation and typically allow for relatively coarse changes in plant community composition. Laboratory, greenhouse, and experimental studies from other biomes provide evidence that acclimation and assembly changes occur, suggesting more plant- and community-organisational changes to temperature that create resilient functional shifts to this environmental driver. Experimental data on how tropical forests respond to increased temperatures is still limited. We assess the resilience of tropical forest carbon exchange to increased temperatures through experimental warming of a 0.2 ha artificial tropical forest: the Biosphere 2 tropical forest biome, B2-TF. The B2-TF experienced temperatures 5–7˚C higher than lowland Amazonia for over 20 years. We compare the temperature response of ecosystem carbon exchange in the B2-TF with several evergreen tropical forests in the Brazilian Amazon and a tropical dry forest in Mexico using eddy flux data. Our results show that the B2-TF sustains carbon assimilation at higher temperatures than in situ tropical forests. Whereas net ecosystem productivity at the Amazonian sites declines as temperatures increase above 28˚C, it is maintained to much higher temperatures in the B2-TF. The tropical dry forest also functions at higher temperatures than the evergreen forests in Brazil but carbon uptake declines at temperatures below those where uptake is sustained in the B2-TF biome. If the B2 forest function is a proxy for how real-world forests respond to temperature, this result suggests that these forests may have acclamation and assembly responses that allow them to tolerate greater temperature increases than models currently assume. Mechanism for this tolerance (not yet resolved in this analysis) could be due to differing responses to vapour pressure deficit inside B2, to true thermal acclimation of photosynthesis, or to shifts in tree community composition.",

However, access to these systems both inside and from outside the observatory offices are limited in some cases by factors such as software cost, network security, and bandwidth. Thus, a variety of Internet-based tools have been developed by the USGS Volcano Science Center to: 1) Improve accessibility to data sources for staff scientists across volcano monitoring disciplines; 2) Allow access for observatory partners and for after-hours, on-call duty scientists; 3) Provide situational awareness for emergency managers and the general public. Herein we describe VolcView (volcview.wr.usgs.gov), a freely available, web-based platform for display and analysis of near-real-time satellite data.\nInitial geographic coverage is of the volcanoes in Alaska, the Russian Far East, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Coverage of other volcanoes in the United States will be added in the future. Near-real-time satellite data from NOAA, NASA and JMA satellite systems are processed to create image products for detection of elevated surface temperatures and volcanic ash and SO2 clouds. VolcView uses HTML5 and the canvas element to provide image overlays (volcano location and alert status, annotation, and location information) and image products that can be queried to provide data values, location and measurement capabilities. Use over the past year during the eruptions of Pavlof, Veniaminof, and Cleveland volcanoes in Alaska by the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the National Weather Service, and the U.S. Air Force has reinforced the utility of shared situational awareness and has guided further development. These include overlay of volcanic cloud trajectory and dispersion models, atmospheric temperature profiles, and incorporation of monitoring alerts from ground and satellite-based algorithms.

            "abstract": "The oil industries and their cornucopian supporters (press, politicians, energy agencies) promote the story that in the oil is abundant and oil production will increase. The reality is that 1) World crude oil production has been on a plateau since 2005, in spite of new technology (fracking), record high prices (Brent Oil > $100 per barrel) and record spending on exploration and development ($5.4 trillion over the past six years) and 2) The price of oil has risen steadily from 1999 to present. Typically when commodities are abundant the price tends to fall.\nHow is this reality being distorted? 1) Resources are being equated with reserves (both are amounts), neither of which can be equated with each other or with production (a rate). 2) Crude oil (the price or which is rigorously defined by API density) has been redefined as total liquids, which includes substances (lease condensates, natural gas liquids, biofuels, refinery gains) which can not be used in the same way oil is or sold for the same price as oil. If what you are selling cannot be sold on the world market as crude oil, then it is not crude oil. 3) The demand for oil remains high, but World production is stagnant and World net-export production has been decreasing since 2005. Thus the price remains high and will only increase in the future. Growth in Global GDP is impacted by high-priced oil.\nHow do you know unethical behavior when you see it? It has to do with intentionality and motivation. “Advocacy science” often reports data to support their cause. Is that unethical? Where is the divide between being an “Issue Advocate” and “Advocacy Science”? If data are reported poorly, is it unethical or just “bad science”? Do the same ethical standards apply to businesses (when profits are involved) and politicians (when elections are at stake)? Why would the definition of oil include NGL, condensates and refinery gains if not trying to inflate the numbers. The standards should be the same, but when there are no reliable independent sources of data, different definitions and uncertainty in the data allow a range of interpretations. Within these limits it allows some to bend the truth for their needs.\nWhat is the solution? With so much at stake, why have the uncertainties in these issues been so poorly examined by the academic community? Doing so will encourage alternative sources of energy to be developed.",

            "abstract": "The tidal flats along the coast of western part of the Korean Peninsula have been developed due to rapid sea-level rise on broad marginal seas during the Holocene. Tidal flats are characterized by large elongate subtidal sand bars and broad intertidal and supratidal mud flats with spring tidal range reaching up to 10 meters. Geomorphic features, surface sediments and core data show that the intertidal flat can be divided into two zones:upper intertidal zone and lower intertidal zone. The upper intertidal zone dips gently seaward with shore-normal tidal creeks, which changes from mud-flat facies to mixed-flat facies with seaward coarsening in average grain size. Dominant sedimentary facies are homogeneous mud (highly bioturbated) and thinly interlaminated sand/mud to coarsely interlaminated sand/mud (wavy and lenticular bedding) showing seasonal bedding.The surface topography of lower intertidal flat is characterized as sand-bar complex migrated landward. The bars are reaching up to 1.5m in height, and shore-parallel tidal creeks are developed between individual bars. Dominant sedimentary facies is sand-flat facies except for mixed-flat facies occurring near boundary of two zones. Broad tidal flats around the islands of the Shinan and Seocheon areas associated with macrotidal range in very shallow epicontinental sea (Yellow Sea) display outstanding geological processes and geoheritage significance, which can be a strong potential World Heritage site.",

            "abstract": "Seasonally dry tropical forests account for over 40% of the forested area in tropical and subtropical regions. Previous studies suggest that seasonal water stress is one main driver of phenology and related vegetation dynamics in seasonally dry tropical forests. Species that coexist in seasonally dry tropical forests have different plant traits, experience different degrees of plant water stress and show distinctive phenological patterns. However, the observed diversity in plant phenology and related vegetation dynamics is poorly represented in current dynamic vegetation models. In this study, we employ a new modeling approach to enhance our model skills in seasonally dry tropical forests. First, we implement a new plant hydraulic module under the framework of a state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation model, Ecosystem Demography 2 (ED2). Second, we link plant water stress with several key coordinated plant traits. Unlike previous models, the updated ED2 does not prescribe leaf phenology (deciduous or evergreen) and plant water stress is not determined by empirical water stress factors or by soil moisture alone. Instead, the model tracks more mechanistic indicators of plant water stress like leaf water potential, accounts for different abilities to tolerate water stress among plant functional types and predicts dry season leaf deciduousness and related vegetation dynamics. The updated model is then tested with in-situ meteorological data and long-term ecological observations. We also perform numerical experiments to explore the possible biases of ignoring the observed diversity in seasonally dry tropical forests. We find that (i) variations of several key plant traits (specific leaf area, wood density, turgor loss point and rooting depth) can account for the observed distinctive phenological patterns as well as inter-annual variations in vegetation growth among species. (ii) Ignoring the trait-driven trade-offs and diversity in seasonality would introduce significant amount of biases in model predictions of ecosystem energy and water fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Future Earth observation missions will produce a large volume of interrelated data sets that will help us to cross-calibrate and validate spaceborne sensor measurements. A forward simulator is a crucial tool for examining the quality of individual products as well as resolving discrepancy among related data sets. NASA Earth Observing System Simulator Suite (NEOS3) is a highly customizable forward simulation tool for Earth remote sensing instruments. Its three-stage simulation process converts the 3D geophysical description of the scene being observed to corresponding electromagnetic emission and scattering signatures, and finally to observable parameters as reported by a (passive or active) remote sensing instrument. User-configurable options include selection of models for describing geophysical properties of atmospheric particles and their effects on the signal of interest, selection of wave scattering and propagation models, and activation of simplifying assumptions (trading between computation time and solution accuracy).\nThe next generation of NEOS3, to be released in 2015, will feature additional state-of-the-art electromagnetic scattering models for various types of the Earth’s surfaces and ground covers (e.g. layered snowpack, forest, vegetated soil, and sea ice) tailored specifically for missions like GPM and SMAP. To be included in 2015 is dedicated functionalities and interface that facilitate integrating NEOS3 into Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) environments. This new generation of NEOS3 can also utilize high performance computing resources (parallel processing and cloud computing) and can be scaled to handle large or computation intensive problems.\nThis presentation will highlight some notable features of NEOS3. Demonstration of its applications for evaluating new mission concepts, especially in the context of OSSE frameworks will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrate, an ice-like clathrate of water and methane, forms in shallow continental slope sediments, and is both a potential energy source and geologic hazard. Hydrates presence is traditionally inferred from the presence of the bottom simulating reflector (BSR), a seismic velocity inversion resulting from free gas pooling at the base of the hydrate stability field. The BSR is not a measure of hydrate, but rather a proxy for free gas presence. Whereas seismic methods are sensitive to velocity anomalies, controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods are sensitive to conductivity anomalies. The electrically resistive methane hydrate makes a favorable target for CSEM surveys, which are capable of detecting and potentially quantifying the presence of methane hydrate directly. Building on previous work 100km to the south in the San Nicolas Basin, we present initial results from a 6-day June 2014 survey in the Santa Cruz Basin, located 100km west of Los Angeles.\nCSEM surveys are performed by deep-towing an EM source that is transmitting a known signal; this signal is detected by towed and seafloor receivers. The initial EM source signal is altered by the electrical properties of the surrounding environment. Conductors such as brine and seawater are attenuating mediums, while resistors such as methane hydrate, gas, and oil are preservative of the original signal. Twenty-one seafloor receivers, as well as a 4 receiver towed array were deployed to image the resistivity structure of the Santa Cruz Basin.\nUsing 30-year-old 2D seismic profiles as a guide, potential hydrate targets were identified, and the transmitter and array were towed over 150 km on 6 lines with 5 seafloor receivers each. The 6 towed lines were coincident with legacy seismic lines. The towed array is sensitive to sediment depths less than 1km, allowing for high data density through the hydrate stability field. The larger transmitter-receiver offsets of the seafloor receivers allow sensitivity to at least 3km below the seafloor. Combining the two data sets allows for both high resolution in the near-seafloor hydrate accumulations as well as imaging the potential gas-source regions of the hydrate field.",

            "abstract": "Geyser eruption cycles can be influenced by adjacent and distant thermals sources, suggesting a hydraulic connection through permeable pathways. Diffusion of fluid pressure can be responsible for the communication between geysers. In this study we examine the processes linking two different geysers with adjacent thermal pools. The first was Vega Rinconada, located at El Tatio geyser field, Chile, where we measured temperature inside the conduit between the ground surface and a depth of seven meters, at one-meter intervals. The second was Lone Star Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, where we measured temperature of the overflow water at the base of the cone. Concurrently, we measured temperature and the water level in pools adjacent to both geysers. We found common elements in both geyser – pool systems: First, water temperature in both adjacent pools was below the boiling point and cooler than water in the geysers. Second, changes in pool water levels were correlated with eruptions of the geysers. During the quiescent period of the geysers, the water level increased in adjacent pools, while water level in the pools deceased during eruptions. Additionally, measurements inside of the conduit in Vega Rinconada Geyser showed that water temperature increased in the deepest part of the conduit during eruptions, while water temperature decreased in the shallow part of the geyser conduit (~1 to 2 m). These drops in temperature in the shallow conduit were coincident with the drop in water level in the adjacent pool. This suggests that after the initiation of an eruption, water may drain from the pool to the geyser. Furthermore, we observed a temperature drop of 3oC in the shallow conduit immediately preceding the end of an eruption. This suggests that flow from the pool to geyser contributes to eruption shut off. Our observations of geyser-pool systems indicate a hydrologic connection between the geysers and their adjacent pools. In the case of Vega Rinconada, cold water drains from the pool to geyser. The Vega Rinconada pool thereby not only records changes in geysers activity, but may also modulate the duration of eruptions.",

            "abstract": "In the lowermost Jurassic, following the end-Triassic mass extinction, coupled positive δ34S and δ13C excursions indicate elevated rates of organic carbon burial. These coupled excursions have been most widely interpreted to result from ocean anoxia driven by warming induced via CO2 effusion from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP). Yet, recent stratigraphic correlations suggest the positive excursions corresponded with an interval – identified by paleosol proxy data – during which pCO2 dropped below pre-extinction baseline levels following the cessation of CAMP activity. If so, the positive δ13C excursion could not have been directly related to CAMP induced warming, nor the pCO2 undershoot driven by enhanced drawdown of carbon by weathering of fresh CAMP basalts. The enhanced weathering of silicate rock can cause a reduction in pCO2, but it cannot increase the ratio of Corg to Ccarb burial – a prerequisite for an increase in δ13C value of the ocean. Here we use a carbon cycle model to test whether the establishment of anoxic marine conditions can account for both the positive δ13C excursion and pCO2 undershoot indicated by the paleosol proxy record. Anoxia leads to high rates of organic carbon burial because it is sustained by enhanced remineralization of phosphate within sulfidic bottom waters. Enhanced return of phosphate to the marine water column fuels further productivity, resulting in the stabilization of anoxia even in the face of rising pO2 and a declining supply of phosphate from weathering. We parameterize this behavior in the model by imparting hysteresis to the C:P burial ratio of sediments such that it remains high even as pCO2 declines past baseline levels, resulting in a pCO2 undershoot accompanying the positive carbon isotope excursion. This interpretation of the data suggests that the negative feedbacks that respond to warming may overcompensate, resulting not in a smooth exponential decay, as the recovery is often modeled, but rather in a non-linear response.",

By contrast to other magnetized planets having large scale dynamo driven magnetic fields Mercury has a quadrupolar field large enough to reinforce the dipolar field at high northern latitudes and to shape the topology of the planetary field in the equatorial region and the southern hemisphere. Magnetic reconnection at Mercury is extremely effective for all IMF orientations [DiBraccio et al., JGR, 2013]. Global hybrid simulations by Richer et al.

Annual biogenic emissions in Texas ranked first within the continental United States in the 2011 National Emission Inventory. In recent years, the effects of drought in Texas have been among the most severe in the southern United States; during 2011, more than 80% of the state was under exceptional drought. Understanding the effects of drought on vegetation and biogenic emissions is important as the state concurrently faces requirements to achieve and maintain attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in several large metropolitan areas. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) has been utilized extensively for the estimation of biogenic emissions on global and regional scales. This research investigates the interannual variability in leaf area index and isoprene and monoterpene emissions estimates from MEGAN in eastern Texas climate regions with diverse climatology and land cover. In MEGAN, the adjustment to emissions from a standardized set of environmental conditions is determined using a multiplication of individual activity factors for leaf age, soil moisture, and the canopy environment. The research also interprets and quantifies differences in environmental activity factors between years with extreme to exceptional drought and average to above average precipitation in eastern Texas and identifies influences on biogenic emissions estimates from MEGAN.",

            "abstract": "Super typhoon (ST) Haiyan killed more than 6,000 and destroyed over a million dwellings in the central Philippines. It is the deadliest typhoon in the Philippines superseding the November 1991 Tropical Storm Thelma disaster in Ormoc City, on the western coast of Leyte Island. Damage and losses from ST Haiyan were particularly high along the coasts surrounding the shallow and funnel-shaped San Pedro Bay, including the coastal city of Tacloban. The first storm surge reconnaissance was conducted from 23 to 28 November 2013 in areas surrounding San Pedro Bay. Follow up surveys were conducted in January, May and June to cover larger and more remote coastlines in Samar Island facing the Leyte Gulf and the Philippine Sea. Digitized local bathymetric charts and Delft3D Flow were used to generate a coupled surge-tide-wave model to simulate the surge heights within San Pedro Bay. We corroborated eyewitness accounts, video recordings, and simulations with field measurements to characterize ST Haiyan’s inundation with flow depths, surge heights, timing and peak flood duration, and resulting damage extent. We also compared the surge heights from ST Haiyan with a similar event from an unnamed typhoon in October 1897 (Ty 1897). Strong winds estimated to be in excess of 280 km h-1 and a ‘tsunami-like’ surge with heights typically ranging from 5 m up to 7 m struck in the early hours of 8 November 2013. According to eyewitness accounts this represents an event in the region of unprecedented magnitude. Historical records, however, clearly indicate that Tacloban and nearby coastal communities were similarly devastated by another typhoon in 1897. The 1897 typhoon crossed the Philippines on a similar path of destruction, almost parallel to ST Haiyan but about 10 to 15 km farther north. Ty 1897 seemed less intense than ST Haiyan but generated a storm surge of comparable magnitude. Inundation heights in 1897 exceeded 4 m in most places with a maximum of 7 m. The Ty 1897 estimated death toll of 1228 corresponds to a similar fatality rate as Haiyan, given the massive population growth between the two events. This historical event demonstrates that ST Haiyan is not unprecedented and highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge, historical awareness and education for appropriate hazard mitigation, response and evacuation.",

            "abstract": "Numerous investigations demonstrate that mantle convective processes affect the surface topography of the overriding plate. ‘Positive dynamic topography’ refers to the surface expression of mantle upwelling. An advecting wave of dynamic topographic surface uplift plate is thought to result from migration of North America relative to the Yellowstone hotspot. Advection of positive dynamic topography through an overriding plate disturbs the landscape by a combination of a change in surface uplift rate and tilting. Identification of dynamic topography’s contribution to evolution of the greater Yellowstone region’s landscape, however, is complicated by the polygenetic regional topography that results from glaciation, bimodal volcanism, Basin and Range extension, early Cenozoic arc volcanism, and Laramide contraction. Our model, which is parameterized to Yellowstone but doesn’t include climate variations, suggests contribution of the dynamic topography erosional signal should decrease from 0.1mm/yr to 0.5 mm/yr at a 100km radius from the hotspot uplift source. The cosmogenic chronology that we are building to constrain spatial patterns of incision in the Bighorn Basin indicates that there is differential incision occurring in the Bighorn basin. Rates vary from 2.8mm/yr in the western basin, which is closer to Yellowstone to 1.1mm/yr in the eastern basin. Global cooling and its effects at the Plio-Pleistocene transition is thought to be the dominant control on the region’s erosional regime. However, the magnitude of the contribution from Yellowstone dynamic topography to the regional landscape evolution is still unknown because published incision rates lack the resolution to differentiate between incision forcing mechanisms. Bedrock stream profile analysis is powerful tool for determining spatial patterns of surface deformation. We compare results for normalized channel steepness indices across various basins in the Central Rockies and Greater Yellowstone area with existing datasets to determine whether regional steepness patterns are associated with the proposed spatial distribution of dynamic topography.",

The hydrographic structure of the upper water above the permanent thermocline may be classified into 4 principal types: (a) classic type (an almost isopycnic upper water); (b) stepwise type (with one or more small but significant step-increases in σθ  in the upper water); (c) graded type (an approximately constant depth gradient in a monotonic increase in σθ in the upper water); and (d) mixed type (a combination of the stepwise and graded types). The 4 types of upper water were found in 75, 14, 5, and 6% of the cruises, respectively. Ten schemes were applied to these data to determine the mixed layer depth (MLD): 4 fixed temperature difference (FTD) methods (0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0oC decrease from 10 m); 1 fixed density difference (FDD) method (0.125 σθ increase from 10 m); 1 fixed temperature gradient (FTG) method (at 0.05oC/m); 3 fixed density gradient (FDG) methods (at 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 σθ/m); and the maximum density gradient (MDG) method. MLD could not be clearly depicted in the 3 minor types of upper water. In the classical type, while similar MLD-s were found in a large majority of the cruises among all 10 methods, substantial discrepancies among methods could be found. The most consistent results, generally within ±5 m, were found among the FDG method at 0.05, 0.1 σθ/m and FTD method at 0.8 and 1.0oC. The MDG method gave consistently deeper MLD by ~8 m. If that difference was taken into account, the results were generally consistent with those from the other 4 methods. The remaining 5 methods could all yield MLD-s shallower than the first 4 methods by >10 m as they failed to capture the bottom of the mixed layer as indicated by visual inspection.",

            "abstract": "Air temperature and humidity are two of the most critical meteorological variables in relation to biological and hydrological processes, human thermal comfort, ecosystems, and energy consumption on heating and cooling.\nYang et al. (2013\n) developed a physically-based analytical spatial air temperature and humidity (PASATH) model to simulate microclimate of urban area. This model can provide spatial time series maps of air temperature, humidity, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux in spatial resolution of one hundred meters and temporal resolution of one hour. PASATH performed satisfactorily given its intended simplicity and low requirement on the inputs. The USDA Forest Service and the Davey Institute developed i-Tree Temperature model based on the PASATH model to complement the strength of the i-Tree suite of tools for urban forest analyses of structure and ecosystem services. The i-Tree temperature model was written in C++ with Objected Oriented Design (OOD). Improved functions were added to improve the simulation of heat flux resistances; new classes were incorporated to better control the inputs and outputs; new model structure was designed to advance the simulation efficiency; inputs formating were optimized to make it more user friendly. The model will be publicly available as a new i-Tree function in 2015 by the USDA Forest Service and the Davey Institute. It can be used to study urban heat island effects and investigate land cover and hydrology based mitigation methods; the simulated spatial maps of air temperature and humidity can provide inputs for other environmental models, including atmospheric models, ecosystem models, and hydrology models, for scientific studies of environmental and human health.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are sites of large lithospheric slabs sinking into the Earth’s mantle inducing complex 3D flow. Seismic anisotropy generated by strain-induced lattice/crystal preferred orientation (LPO/CPO) of intrinsically anisotropic minerals is commonly used to study the patterns of mantle flow and the associated plate motions at convergent margins. Here, we computed the upper mantle fabric due to strain-induced LPO in 3D thermo-mechanical models of dynamic subduction. Overall, strong fabrics develop in the upper and mid mantle around the subduction zone. We find that the mantle fabric occurrence depends on the distribution and amount of the deformation, whereas it is independent of the rate of subduction. As a consequence, distinctive fabric patterns are formed in the upper mantle below, aside and above the slab. Additionally, synthetic seismograms of teleseismic waves propagating sub-vertically were computed to estimate SKS splitting, which are sensitive to the upper mantle anisotropy. The results are remarkably comparable with observations from different subduction settings (i.e., Cascadia, Calabria, Aegean), yielding strong constraints on the recent dynamics of these margins. Concluding, we discuss the potential bias the seismic anisotropy introduces, which might affect isotropic seismic tomographies imaging subduction zones and eventually leading to (mis)interpreation of artificial seismic anomalies.

            "abstract": "Poorly constrained rates of biomass turnover are a key limitation of Earth system models (ESM). In light of this, we recently proposed a new approach encoded in a model called Populations-Order-Physiology (POP), for the simulation of woody ecosystem stand dynamics, demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. POP is suitable for continental to global applications and designed for coupling to the terrestrial ecosystem component of any ESM. POP bridges the gap between first generation Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) with simple large-area parameterisations of woody biomass (typically used in current ESMs) and complex second generation DVMs, that explicitly simulate demographic processes and landscape heterogeneity of forests. The key simplification in the POP approach, compared with second-generation DVMs, is to compute physiological processes such as assimilation at grid-scale (with CABLE or a similar land surface model), but to partition the grid-scale biomass increment among age classes defined at sub grid-scale, each subject to its own dynamics. POP was successfully demonstrated along a savanna transect in northern Australia, replicating the effects of strong rainfall and fire disturbance gradients on observed stand productivity and structure.\nHere, we extend the application of POP to a range of forest types around the globe, employing paired observations of stem biomass and density from forest inventory data to calibrate model parameters governing stand demography and biomass evolution. The calibrated POP model is then coupled to the CABLE land surface model and the combined model (CABLE-POP) is evaluated against leaf-stem allometry observations from forest stands ranging in age from 3 to 200 years. Results indicate that simulated biomass pools conform well with observed allometry. We conclude that POP represents an ecologically plausible and efficient alternative to large-area parameterisations of woody biomass turnover, typically used in current ESMs.\nHaverd, V., Smith, B., Briggs, P.R., Nieradzik, L.P, 2014.

            "abstract": "The Arkavathy River Basin adjacent to Bangalore, India, faces a multitude of challenges driven by water demands from urbanization and intensification of agriculture. In the Arkavathy Basin, the two major reservoirs that historically supplied water to Bangalore now receive little to no inflow. Recent research has resulted in multiple plausible hypotheses attributing streamflow reductions in the Arkavathy to (1) increased evapotranspiration due to a boom in eucalyptus plantations and irrigated agriculture, and (2) increased deep drainage from surface soils due to long-term, excessive groundwater extraction. Current knowledge of Bangalore's water scarcity is largely based on anecdotal evidence and the sparse environmental data for this region is insufficient to definitively test these hypotheses. To bridge the gap between provincial and academic knowledge and better understand the nature of regional water resource depletion, we utilize a range of methods to integrate information across spatial and temporal scales. We use the full history of Landsat satellite imagery to approximate post-monsoon water storage in tanks and construct a spatially-explicit, historical record of surface water. We combine stable isotope mixing models, traditional field methods, and kite photography to build a deeper understanding of rainfall-runoff processes. Remote-sensing results confirm reductions of surface water in many of the tanks in the upper reaches of the watershed. We also observe an increase in surface water availability downstream of Bangalore, where imported water results in large waste flows. Field methods reveal considerable contributions of Hortonian overland flow due to soils with low hydraulic conductivity, mitigating changes in the subsurface water balance. We conclude that surface water availability is strongly related to spatial patterns of urban and agricultural water demand overlaid on a template defined by topography, soil, and climate.",

            "abstract": "Sea level change is an issue of immense importance in conjunction with global warming. The advent of satellite measurements offers a unique opportunity to address the global patterns of sea level height change associated with global warming. The rate of sea level change, however, is still uncertain due to the relatively short length of the satellite measurements, which began in 1993. In the present study, the contribution of global warming was separated from natural variability via cyclostationary EOF analysis in a sea level reconstruction dataset covering 1950-2010. Global sea level change due to the warming signal is within the range of fluctuations of the global average sea level computed directly from the data but is much less contaminated by natural variability as in the globally averaged sea level heights. A quadratic polynomial fit to the global warming signal indicates that the rate of sea level rise has increased by 0.2 mm yr-1 per decade and is 1.3 mm yr-1 as of 2010. The current rate of sea level rise is lower than that estimated from the globally averaged sea level heights by 0.2 mm yr-1 but is in the 1s range of the estimate (1.3 – 1.8 mm yr-1).\n Separation of the global warming mode from natural variability allow us to estimate the magnitude of natural variability and the relative significance of sea level change due to global warming. It appears that the sea level change due to global warming is, in general, comparable to natural variability in magnitude so far. Notable exceptions are over the southern tropical Indian, equatorial Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and along the extensions of the western boundary currents. Sea level rise due to warming is expected to exceed several standard deviations of natural variability by 2060 over the majority of the world oceans. This implies that coastal regions will be much more prone to disasters (such as hurricanes) due to warming-induced sea level rise.",

This is most clearly expressed by the fast flowing ice streams in Greenland and Antarctica, where low levels of basal friction are thought to support the high flow rates. These ice streams are of particular interest since they are large constituents of the polar ice sheet mass balance. The study of these ice streams and their future impact on the ice sheets necessitates a deeper understanding of their basal dynamics, including the rheology of water-saturated sediment.\nWe present the methodology and first results of a coupled numerical model for computational experiments on granular-fluid mixtures under dynamic conditions similar to those in subglacial settings. The granular phase is simulated on a per-particle basis by the soft body discrete element method. The fluid phase is handled as a continuum by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The particle and fluid phases are coupled by mass conservation and momentum exchanges.\nThe hydraulic diffusivity and permeability is compared to previous laboratory studies on tills. We demonstrate how the onset and halt of granular deformation is an efficient mechanism to create fluid pressure fluctuations due to local porosity changes. These pressure anomalies are driving transient hydraulic flows, and they influence directly the rheology of granular-fluid mixtures. Our results highlight the nonlinear nature of water saturated granular deformation, and demonstrate how the mechanical behaviour of granular materials may include both brittle and viscous components depending on the rates of deformation and the hydrological properties.",

To characterize the provenance and transport pathways of eolian dust deposited in the western tropical/subtropical Pacific, and to investigate changes over the late Quaternary, we used the clay mineral assemblage, together with the 143Nd/144Nd and 87Sr/86Sr composition of the inorganic silicate fractions of a deep-sea sediment core retrieved from the Palau-Kyushu Ridge in the Philippine Sea. The analyzed attributes of the core resemble those of dust from the central Asian deserts (CADs; e.g., the Taklimakan Desert) as in the North Central Pacific, but published aerosol data collected near the study site during winter/spring has the mineralogical signature of dust originating from the East Asian deserts (EADs; e.g., the Chinese Loess Plateau and nearby deserts). These data indicate that the relative contribution of EAD dust increases with the northeasterly surface winds associated with the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) during winter/spring, but the Prevailing Westerlies and Trade Winds that carry dust from the CADs have been the dominant transport agent for the last 600 kyr.

The development of in-situ oxygen isotope analysis by ion microprobe permits to add fluid evolution to metamorphic histories. Accurate oxygen isotope analysis requires matrix-matched standards and, for chemically complex minerals, also appropriate matrix corrections. We will report on recent progresses on the analysis of oxygen isotopes in monazite, allanite and garnet using the SHRIMP ion microprobe.\nZircon is a prime candidate for retrieving the oxygen composition of the pre-metamorphic protolith, as inherited zircons are preserved in many high-grade rocks. Metamorphic zircon rims that differ from the cores in δ18O offer insight into the origin of the fluid and the timing as well as degree of fluid-rock interaction. Garnet is another exceptional recorder of multiple metamorphic stages. Highly zoned garnets are found in a variety of eclogite-facies rocks and they can preserve dramatic oxygen isotopic variations (differences of a few to 10 δ18O ‰ within single crystal).\nGarnet and zircons from eclogite-facies metamorphic veins and shear zones within the metamorphosed Lago Superiore Unit from the Monviso ophiolite (W. Alps) have distinct growth zones with different oxygen isotopes composition. The shift in oxygen isotopes between the magmatic zircon core and the metamorphic zircon rim testifies to metasomatism by fluids equilibrated with serpentinites. The oxygen isotopes zoning in garnet confirms large scale fluid metasomatism concentrated in shear zones. It also indicates that some major shear zones from the Monviso ophiolitic sequence possibly underwent two stages of metasomatism, an event before or during early subduction and a later stage at around 550°C/2.5 GPa at peak pressure metamorphism.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic activity at Ambrym volcano (Vanuatu) is currently characterised by continuous lava lake activity within two main cones (Marum and Benbow), distant by 3 km. Acoustic measurements were performed by an acoustic array set at a distance of 3 km from the active vents between April 2009 and January 2010. The detection of volcanic signals, done by using PMCC (progressive multi-channel correlation), showed that more than 97 % of the detections came from one of the active vents, with millions of acoustic transients and no quiescent period. Two short Strombolian phases and 3 isolated explosions existed at Marum during this period while no strong signal was detected at Benbow. The active degassing, i.e. that detected by acoustic measurements, is mostly around 1 Hz at both vents. The gas volume is estimated from calculating acoustic power for each detection in the 0.8-2 Hz frequency range, assuming that the source has a constant radius of 5 m. The gas volume expelled per hour is similar at Benbow and Marum with 0.5-4 Mm^3. One striking observation is the existence of regular alternations between periods with high and small expelled gas volume, with 3 Mm^3 per hour and 0.5 Mm^3 per hour for each period, respectively. The detection of acoustic pulses even small, which is done with wavelet analysis, showed rapid and regular variations in the number of acoustic transients (1-460). The duration, return time and expelled gas volume were similar at Benbow and Marum on the 50 and 38 recognised cycles, respectively. The duration, return time and expelled gas volume at Benbow were equal to 58 hr, 70 hr and 42 Mm^3, respectively. Their relative small standart deviation for the above parameters, equal to 24 hr, 82 hr and 26 Mm^3 respectively, suggested that the fluctuations between periods with high and low gas volume, is probably cyclic. This 5 days-cyclicity could be perhaps be related to thermal convection processes in the magma reservoir.",

            "abstract": "The health impacts of extreme heat are significantly aggravated when combined with high humidity [1]. Wet-bulb temperature (\nT\nw\n), measured by wrapping a thermometer in a wetted cloth and fully ventilating it, provides a physical metric of the combined effect of both heat and humidity.\nT\nw\nin excess of 30\n∘\nC is extremely dangerous and has been observed in the US only during the peak of the 1995 Midwest heat wave. Historically unprecedented\nT\nw\nin excess of 33\n∘\nC represents an extreme threat to human health, with heat stroke likely for fit individuals after less than one hour of shaded activity [2,3].\nWe present an empirical method for generating downscaled probability distributions of daily maximum\nT\nw\nconditional on dry-bulb temperature. The approach is based upon the statistical relationship between these two parameters, as estimated from reanalysis data. Using statistically downscaled temperature projections for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6, we project changes in\nT\nw\nfor the next two centuries. We find that dangerously humid days (\nT\nw\n> 27\n∘\nC) will become increasingly common in the eastern U.S. under RCP 8.5, with the expected number of days per summer surpassing those of Louisiana today in Chicago in 25 years, Washington, D.C. in 30 years, New York City in 50 years and Portland in 60 years. By the end of the century under RCP 8.5, one extraordinarily dangerous (\nT\nw\n> 33\n∘\nC) day per year is expected in counties currently home to about one-third of the U.S. population. Mitigation can significantly the expected number of extreme wet-bulb temperature days, with only one-eighth of the U.S. population in counties with a 1-in-10 chance per year of an extraordinarily dangerous day by the end of the century under RCP 4.5.\n",
